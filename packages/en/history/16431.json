RUNCIMAN\r\n\r\nLONDON\r\nG. BELL AND SONS, LTD.\r\n1913\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO\r\nHAROLD HODGE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is now one hundred years since Richard Wagner was born, thirty\r\nsince he died. In every land he has his monument in one shape or\r\nanother; his music-dramas can be heard all the world over; all the\r\nancient controversies as to their merits or demerits have died down.\r\nThe Bayreuth theatre, the outward and visible sign of his inner\r\ngreatness, has risen to the point of its most splendid glory and\r\nlapsed into the limbo of tenth-rate things. Every one who really cares\r\nfor the art of music, and especially the art of opera (of which art\r\nmusic is by far the most important factor), has had ample time and\r\nopportunity for making up his mind. It is, therefore, high time to\r\nsimplify and to cease from elaborating. In this book will be found, I\r\ntrust, no special pleading, no defence or extenuation, no preposterous\r\neulogy on the one hand, and on the other no vampire work, but a plain\r\nand concise attempt to depict the mighty artist as he lived and to\r\ndescribe his artistic achievement as it is. We have all had time to\r\nconsider and to sort out (so to say) the reams that have been written\r\nand printed about Wagner: the bulk of it has had to be thrown on the\r\nscrap-heap: what there was of value has, I hope, been utilised.\r\n\r\nAn author who plans a book on an artist or an artistic question must\r\nbe wary, especially at the beginning of his adventure. To start away\r\nwith a theory, whether new or old, and to yield to the seductive\r\ntemptation to convince humanity of its truth--this is to lay a trap\r\nand to take the path that leads straight into it. Theories should be\r\nkept for scientific matters. A work proving that parallel straight\r\nlines never meet need not land the writer in self-contradictions; and\r\nanother writer may prove that they must and do meet, and still avoid\r\ngetting tangled amongst his own arguments. I even read a book once in\r\nwhich it was clearly shown that the earth was flat; and, granted a\r\nludicrous premise, one could but admire the irrefragable logic with\r\nwhich the conclusion was reached. With regard to art, be your premises\r\nsound or grotesque, the result is the same--muddle. Logic, science,\r\nphilosophy, applied to art, spell certain disaster. With mingled pain\r\nand amusement I have noted how more than one writer on music, setting\r\nout in triumphant high spirits to demonstrate this or that, has before\r\nhis third chapter demonstrated just the contrary: I have never seen\r\nanything else occur.\r\n\r\nWagner wrote so much about himself and his art, and appeared so fully\r\nsatisfied with his explanations of why he became just what he became\r\nand of why his art was just what it was, that naturally for nearly a\r\ngeneration his critics fell into one or other of two errors. Either\r\nthey accepted his theorisings unreservedly or as unreservedly they\r\nrejected them. In the second case they had to face the difficulty of\r\ncoining, shaping, a theory of their own; in either case shipwreck\r\nnearly always promptly ensued; and on the whole, if Wagner had to be\r\ntheorised about, one would prefer to have it done by Wagner. He\r\nhimself knew the tiny value of his theorisings about his art, for he\r\ndeclared that when he wrote _Tristan and Isolda_ he found he had\r\nalready left his theories far behind. This discovery might well have\r\nserved as a warning both to Wagner and to the hosts of his\r\ncommentators. Unluckily Wagner was far too fond of theorising,\r\nmoralising and generally talking of himself and his works, and he\r\nreckoned he had a big propagandist work to do; so he went on\r\nscribbling to the end. As for the commentators, they neglected the\r\nwarning and took Wagner's later doings as an example, with the result\r\nthat the library shelves of Europe are stopped and blocked with as big\r\na heap of rubbish as ever was provoked by great works of art since the\r\nworld began to turn round. For Wagner there is an ample excuse: he\r\nhonestly thought it necessary to spread his ideas abroad; his aims and\r\nintentions had been so misunderstood, and so stupidly, wickedly,\r\nrecklessly misrepresented, that he did not believe his music-dramas\r\nwould ever find acceptance until he had cleared the way by explaining\r\nhimself. Little good came of it--in fact, the only good result was\r\nthat some of his writings fell into the hands of Ludwig II of Bavaria,\r\nand thus led to the ending of his days of misery, and indirectly to\r\nBayreuth. For the commentators no word of extenuation can be said.\r\nThose, perhaps, of the period 1867-77 were justified in pressing their\r\nmaster's claims on the public at large, for the support of the public\r\nat large had to be won, and the best way of winning it seemed to lie\r\nin advocating those claims, in season and out of season, through the\r\nagency of the newspaper-press; but the rest of the herd have proved\r\nthemselves an unqualified nuisance and a hindrance to a right\r\nunderstanding of Wagner.\r\n\r\nThis herd I would not willingly join. In the following pages no\r\ngeneral theory concerning Wagner will be found. I shall indulge in no\r\ntheorisings whatever, but stick to the facts, facts which can now be\r\nascertained with certainty. My endeavour will be to tell a plain,\r\nunvarnished tale of what Wagner did and of what he suffered, of the\r\nenvironment amidst which he grew up and laboured and struggled: with\r\nall that he said and wrote I shall deal as briefly as may be,\r\nregarding his endless loquacity of mouth and pen as of interest only\r\nwhen it throws real light on the artist. Least of all shall I waste\r\nthe reader's patience on the morals that may be drawn from his musical\r\nworks. The moral to be drawn from his prose works is simply that a\r\nman, even a stupendously great man, may write far too much; the moral\r\nto be drawn from his musical works every man may find out for himself:\r\nfor myself, I have found none, any more than I could ever find a moral\r\nin a play of Æschylus or Sophocles or Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of authorities for the statements now to be made. We\r\nhave the exhaustive _Life_ by Glasenapp and W. Ashton Ellis; then\r\nthere is Wagner's own work, _My Life_, lately translated into\r\nEnglish; finally there are the _Letters_. Many of these are of no\r\ninterest or value whatever, dealing only with details concerning\r\nscores and proof-sheets and petty money matters. Many, on the other\r\nhand, notably those to Uhlig, are invaluable to every one who wishes\r\nto understand Wagner. Extensive use is made of them in this book,\r\nthough, as they are easily accessible, I have forborne to quote more\r\nthan is absolutely necessary. _My Life_ I think but little of, and\r\nhave not relied greatly on it.\r\n\r\nWagner the reformer will receive no lengthy consideration. He did not\r\n\"reform\" the opera form--the opera form of Mozart and Weber needed no\r\nreforming--he simply developed it. He did reform operatic performances\r\nby insisting on precision and intelligence in place of slovenliness\r\nand stupidity, on enthusiasm for art in place of stolid indifference;\r\nand he did as much in the concert-room. I shall not theorize about\r\nthese matters, but point out what he achieved by making a continuous\r\nappeal to indubitable, indisputable facts.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Messrs. H. Grevel & Co. for kind permission to print\r\nextracts from Mr. Shedlock's translation of Wagner's _Letters_, and to\r\nMessrs. Novello for similar permission regarding quotations from the\r\nlibretti of the operas. Two words may be said about the quotations,\r\nboth words and music, of the operas: in some cases, when I could\r\nneither find nor make an adequate translation of verses, I have stuck\r\nto the original German; with regard to the music, I have given as\r\nlittle as possible. Both musical and verbal citations are meant for\r\nreference--there is only one exception, the Sailors' Song from the\r\nopening of _Tristan_. Catalogues of Wagner's themes have for long been\r\nissued by several publishers; but they are of small assistance in\r\nhelping one to understand Wagner.\r\n\r\nJ.F.R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nI  EARLY LIFE\r\n\r\nII  EARLY BOYHOOD\r\n\r\nIII  EARLY LIFE (_continued_)\r\n\r\nIV  JUVENILE WORKS\r\n\r\nV  PARIS\r\n\r\nVI  'RIENZI' AND 'THE FLYING DUTCHMAN'\r\n\r\nVII  DRESDEN\r\n\r\nVIII  'TANNHÄUSER'\r\n\r\nIX  'LOHENGRIN'\r\n\r\nX  EXILE\r\n\r\nXI  'TRISTAN AND ISOLDA'\r\n\r\nXII  'THE MASTERSINGERS OF NUREMBERG'\r\n\r\nXIII  KING LUDWIG\r\n\r\nXIV  'THE NIBELUNG'S RING' AND THE RHINEGOLD'\r\n\r\nXV 'THE VALKYRIE'\r\n\r\nXVI 'SIEGFRIED'\r\n\r\nXVII  'THE DUSK OF THE GODS'\r\n\r\nXVIII  'PARSIFAL'; THE END; THE MAN\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTRAIT OF WAGNER (_Photogravure_)\r\n\r\nWAGNER'S BIRTHPLACE: THE SIGN OF THE RED\r\nAND WHITE LION, ON THE BRÜHL, LEIPZIG\r\n\r\nTHE WAGNER THEATRE AT BAYREUTH\r\n\r\nLISZT\r\n(_From life and on stone by N.

The precise date was\r\nMay 22; and owing to many causes the 16th of August came round before,\r\nat the church of St. Thomas, the child was christened Wilhelm Richard\r\nWagner. The events and circumstances of the period have furnished the\r\nimaginative with many striking portents with regard to the future\r\nmighty composer; and, to do the prophets full justice, after the\r\nevent--long after the event--they have widely opened their mouths and\r\nuttered prophecies. Thus the name of the house, describing a beast\r\nsuch as never was on sea or land, distinctly warned a drowsy people\r\nthat the monstrous dragon of _Siegfried_ was about to take the road\r\nleading from Nowhere to Bayreuth. The spring foretold the songs in\r\n_Tannhäuser_ and the _Valkyrie_; the summer, the nights in King\r\nMark's Cornish castle-garden and amongst the fragrant lime-trees in\r\nthe streets of ancient Nuremberg; the horrors of the war raging at the\r\nvery gates of Leipzig and Napoleon's flight, the advent of the\r\npreacher who was to earn a long exile by advising the Saxon soldiers\r\nnot to shoot their brethren. Events provided material for these and\r\nmany another score of prognostications: only, fortunately, no one read\r\nevents rightly at the time, and something fresh was left for the\r\nbiographers to expend their ingenuity upon.\r\n\r\nRichard Wagner came of a German lower middle-class stock. There is not\r\namongst his ancestry a single man distinguished in letters or any art.\r\nHis uncle Adolph, of whom some Bayreuth gentlemen make much, would not\r\nbe remembered had he not been Wagner's uncle. Only by patient research\r\nhas it been discovered that one or more of his forebears could so much\r\nas play the organ. His father was an amateur theatrical enthusiast,\r\nand he too would have been utterly forgotten had he not been Wagner's\r\nfather. His stepfather--though this seems hardly to the point--was an\r\nactor and portrait-painter; and his one claim to remembrance is that\r\nhe was Wagner's stepfather. So, however scientifically minded we may\r\nbe, however strongly disposed to account for the sudden appearance of\r\na stupendous genius by the cheap and easy method of pointing to some\r\ndistinguished ancestor and talking pompously of the laws of heredity,\r\nin Wagner's case we are baffled and beaten. He came like a\r\nthunderbolt out of a blue sky. We must be content with the fact that\r\nhe came. His father and grandfather were state or municipal officials\r\nboth; and bearing in mind Wagner's frank detestation of officialdom,\r\nthe scientist can scarcely draw much comfort from that.\r\n\r\nThe grandfather, Gottlob Friedrich Wagner, was born in 1736, only a\r\nfew years later than Haydn. In 1769 he married the daughter of a\r\ncharity-school master or caretaker; and in 1770, the year of\r\nBeethoven's birth, his first child, christened Carl Friedrich Wilhelm,\r\nwas born. Four years later Adolph arrived. Gottlob was a douanier, an\r\nexciseman, at the Rannstadt gate of Leipzig, and passed his days, I\r\ndare say, as honestly as an exciseman can, in examining incoming\r\ntravellers to see that they did not bring with them so much as an egg\r\nthat had not paid duty. He died in 1795. Meantime, Carl Friedrich had\r\nreceived a thoroughly sound education, and he became deputy-registrar\r\nto the Leipzig town court. In 1789 he married Johanna Rosina Pätz\r\n(whose name, it seems, is susceptible of many spellings).\r\n\r\nThe scientific mind may after all find consolation in the\r\nall-illuminating truth that Friedrich and all his children were more\r\nor less passionately addicted to the theatre and attracted by it. It\r\nwas Friedrich's one hobby; and though Friedrich's brother Adolph had a\r\nhorror of it, the feeling was not aroused by it as an artistic\r\ninstitution, but as an agency for the intellectual, moral and worldly\r\nruin of young men and women. In his leisure Friedrich arranged\r\ndramatic performances and took part in them, and, as amateurs go, he\r\nappears to have been highly successful. Histrionic persons were\r\nconstant guests at his house on the Brühl--amongst them notably one,\r\nLudwig Geyer, who became a fast friend of the family and played an\r\nimportant rôle, off the stage, with regard to that family soon after\r\nRichard's birth. Friedrich, during his later years, cannot have had\r\nmuch spare time for amateur theatricals or any other amusement.\r\nNapoleon was fighting his last desperate fights against the combined\r\nforces of reactionary Europe; all the powers of feudalism had combined\r\nto crush an emperor who had no royal blood in his veins; he raged over\r\nGermany like an infuriated beast with a genius for military tactics,\r\nscattering armies which dispersed only to join together and face him\r\nagain. While Richard was in his cradle the whole of Saxony was filled\r\nwith the squalor and misery and loathsome terrors of war. Leipzig was\r\noccupied by the French; Marshal Davoust was left there as commandant,\r\nwith power of life and death, and all the other privileges of a\r\nmilitary governor; and in the deputy-registrar of the law-court he\r\nfound the man for the post of provisional chief of the police \"of\r\npublic safety.\" Who kept the public safe from the police I am unable\r\nto say. Fighting was going on perpetually in the neighbourhood; the\r\ndead and dying lay scattered in all directions; the stench bred\r\nepidemics more murderous than all Napoleon's cannon. Friedrich must\r\nhave found his hands full day and night. Richard was baptized on\r\nAugust 16; the following day Napoleon won a victory which cost him\r\ndear; the 18th, being Sunday, was observed as such by a soldiery in\r\nneed of a rest; on the 19th Napoleon was a beaten man, and ran to save\r\nhis skin past the windows of the house of the Red and White Lion on\r\nthe Brühl. Richard's mother had been trembling for her own safety and\r\nthat of her children and husband; but when, as she herself afterwards\r\ntold, she saw the dreaded conqueror bolt in haste without his hat, she\r\nbreathed again. Whether she and the family were any better off under\r\nthe deliverers is a question that does not concern us here: the point\r\nis that she thought she was. It was all one to Richard, who, aged\r\nthree months, slept peacefully on.\r\n\r\nAfter the deliverance Friedrich's work became even heavier than\r\nbefore. The town through its length and breadth was shattered and\r\ndilapidated; whole families were homeless and packed like rabbits in\r\nhutches; the slaughtered dead, men and beasts, could not be buried\r\nquick enough; black death stalked abroad in the guise of what was\r\ncalled hospital typhus--an epidemic fever of some kind. After the\r\nFrench flight, I take it, provisional chief-policeman Wagner had\r\nreturned to his deputy-registrarship; but his toils were none the\r\nlighter for that. He exhausted himself; the appalling fever attacked\r\nhim and he had no strength to resist it; and he died on November 22,\r\nexactly six months after the birth of Richard. Wagner's ill-luck, his\r\nwicked fairy, struck her first blow while his age had to be reckoned\r\nin months; she went on striking, and never ceased to strike, until he\r\nwas beginning to grow a little weary and his age was reckoned in\r\ndecades of years, and in terms of masterpieces accomplished and\r\ninsults and ill-usage by no means patiently borne. It must have seemed\r\nhard to his widowed mother, after the uncertainties and horrors of the\r\nlast years, that when at last a period of happy peace seemed about to\r\ndawn, uncertainties and griefs and worries of a fresh sort should come\r\nupon her.\r\n\r\nWhether Frau Wagner ever actually drew any pension from the good\r\nburghers of Leipzig or the greedy state officials of Saxony seems,\r\nwhen all is said, very uncertain. In such times of stress and struggle\r\ngreat crown officers, laudably anxious about their own interests and\r\nthe interests of their families, are apt to be rather careless, not to\r\nsay callous, about the smaller fry. However, pension or no pension,\r\nwith the aid of relatives and friends the Wagners pulled through.\r\nChief and best amongst the friends was Ludwig Geyer.\r\n\r\nA few words must be said about him. Born in 1780, he was ten years\r\nCarl Friedrich's junior. An actor who had taken up painting, or a\r\npainter who had taken up acting, in both arts he had won at any rate a\r\nlocal reputation. We know what was thought of his histrionic gifts\r\nfrom more or less competent contemporaries; but what to think of his\r\npaintings I do not know, for two reasons: I do not trust my own\r\njudgment in such a matter, and if I did, I have never seen any of\r\nGeyer's work. Of this, however, I am very sure: he cannot have been a\r\ngood painter unless nature had worked a miracle in sending a good\r\npainter to Germany in the eighteenth or nineteenth century. German\r\nartists of the period must be classified not as sheep and goats, but\r\nas bad goats and worse goats. But if he was not a fine painter he was\r\nwhat is better, or, at any rate, more useful to the rest of human\r\nkind, a fine character: a noble, generous, self-sacrificing man. In\r\nhaste on hearing of Carl Friedrich's death he came from Dresden to\r\nattend to the burying of the dead and the nourishing of the living.\r\nThe details of this first period of Richard's ill-fortune do not\r\namount to a great deal and are unimportant, since our subject is\r\nRichard, and his mother, brother and sisters only so far as their\r\nlives and characters influenced Richard. Albert, the eldest of the\r\nchildren, was now fourteen years old; he was at the Royal school in\r\nMeissen, and there he remained. Rosalie went to dwell with a friend of\r\nGeyer's, a lady who lived at Dresden. Louise was adopted by a Frau\r\nHartwig, also at Dresden. Richard in his cradle remained with his\r\nmother and the younger members of the tribe in Leipzig.\r\n\r\nAnd so presently life began to move on as before, while the dead man\r\nslept in his grave. But immediately fresh troubles came. Albert fell\r\ndangerously ill and was threatened with a total breakdown of his\r\nhealth; Richard was an ailing infant; and a change in the arrangements\r\nof the theatrical company which provided Geyer with a portion of his\r\nincome compelled him to remain in Dresden continuously. This proved\r\nreally a stroke of good fortune. Glasenapp, basing his calculations\r\non I know not what authorities or documents, computes that his\r\nearnings as an actor at this time came to £156 a year, and there seems\r\nevery reason to think he was at least fairly well paid for his\r\nportraits. It was not enough to be shared between two families, or, we\r\nhad better say, to be devoted to the up-keep of two homes. He\r\ndetermined rapidly on a bold stroke. That he was in love with Frau\r\nWagner is more than any one can declare with confidence; but she was\r\nan amiable, bright woman, a good mother and thrifty housekeeper; and\r\nit is likely enough that she had inspired a deep affection in a\r\nsingularly loving man. After the recovery of Albert the widow had gone\r\nfor a change to Dresden; and there Geyer resolved to marry her--and\r\nresolved quickly; for Carl Friedrich died in November 1813, and early\r\nin 1814 the marriage took place. Soon after, the new Frau Geyer\r\nreturned to Leipzig; then the whole family migrated to Dresden, where\r\nRichard was to pass from babyhood into boyhood and spend the first\r\nfourteen years of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe Geyer-Wagner family set up their tent in the Moritz-strasse in\r\nDresden, which belonged to the seventeenth or eighteenth century--was\r\nin fact almost mediæval. Life must have been atrociously narrow and\r\ntrammelled to any free spirit. But Germany did not produce many of\r\nthat sort at the time, and those she did produce were quickly\r\nsilenced in gaol. Whether Geyer had yearnings for outward liberty\r\ncannot be said; but if he had he gave no expression to them, being\r\nhimself a court player and a semi-court painter. Undoubtedly the main\r\nthing to him was that in the drowsy court air he could at least earn\r\nthe means of bringing up adequately the large family he had taken on\r\nhis shoulders. He played constantly in all sorts of parts, and in his\r\noff hours painted; he also wrote a number of theatre pieces of varying\r\ntype and importance--none of which concern us here. His wife enjoyed a\r\nperiod of peace in which to attend to her husband, children and house,\r\nas a faithful hausfrau should. If Geyer was industrious and much\r\noccupied, he nevertheless found time to cultivate friendships, and\r\nsome of them in later days were continued by Richard.\r\n\r\nThe whole life of the circle went on around the theatre or in it; it\r\nmust have been their whole world, for of culture other than of the\r\ntheatre there is no indication--save one or two half-hearted remarks\r\nof Geyer's at a slightly later period. They admired Goethe and\r\nSchiller, of course, and knew their theatre works; they knew of the\r\nRomantics in so far as they affected the theatre; it seems to have\r\nbeen only through the theatre they saw anything or could see anything.\r\nBreathing the theatrical atmosphere constantly, one after another of\r\nGeyer's step-children caught the theatre malady (for it will be\r\nadmitted that men or women must have something the matter with them if\r\nthey deliberately choose a theatrical life); and within a few years\r\nthree of them were appearing on the stage. Albert left school and went\r\nto the university to study medicine; after a very brief struggle he\r\ngave this up, studied singing, and in 1819 or 1820 made his debut as a\r\nlight-opera tenor. Before this Geyer had warned him against taking\r\nsuch a course; but apparently he was obdurate. On May 2 of the former\r\nyear Rosalie had first appeared as an actress in a piece by Geyer;\r\nstill earlier Louise had also begun acting child-parts. There must\r\nhave been a good deal of family discussion and commotion about these\r\nthings. It had been the wish of Friedrich Wagner that Rosalie should,\r\nor perhaps might, take to the stage as a profession, but in no case\r\nuntil she had attained the age of sixteen. Friedrich's brother Adolph,\r\nas I have said, set himself in deadly opposition to anything of the\r\nsort happening. Letters and counter-letters ensued; but the instinct\r\nof the youngsters turned out to be sufficiently strong, and perhaps\r\nthe opposition of Geyer too feeble to carry the day; and one after\r\nanother the Wagners took to the boards as ducklings to water. Geyer\r\nkept his word to his dead friend, however; and Rosalie, though she had\r\nbeen long preparing, made no public appearance until she reached\r\nsixteen. A little longer and Clara took up the family occupation. How\r\nall this affected the family generally, and especially Richard, we\r\nshall see before long. In the meantime it may be mentioned that\r\nJulius, the second son, nine years Richard's senior, was apprenticed\r\nat Eisleben to Geyer's younger brother, a goldsmith: he alone was not\r\npulled stagewards.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nNaturally enough there is nothing but idle and frequently fatuous\r\nhearsay to repeat of these early years, save this only, that Richard\r\ndid not show the slightest musical precocity. Nor need this surprise\r\nus. Mozart, Bach, Beethoven were brought up in households where music\r\nwas as the daily bread; their ears must have been filled with it while\r\nthey were in their cradles. It is true that Handel's father dreaded\r\nmusic as a disease and a musician as a vagabond; but in this case the\r\nprecocity is quite unattested, and the stories of the six-year boy\r\npractising on a dumb-spinet at midnight originated when the boy had\r\nbecome the most celebrated musician in Europe. I wish here to make a\r\nfew not wholly irrelevant remarks. The tales of Handel's wondrous\r\nbabyhood were repeated, and repeated many times, by writers who did\r\nnot know what a dumb-spinet was and certainly made no inquiries\r\nregarding the source of the tales. Both legend and dumb-spinet are\r\nswallowed cheerfully to this day because so many authors accept them;\r\nand I would point out that the first author, No. I, was simply copied\r\nrecklessly by author No. II, that author No. III, maybe a little less\r\nrecklessly, copied No. II because he was supported by No. I; and thus\r\nthe game went on until the simple minds of a generation think that\r\nwhat fifty writers have said must be true. Ten thousand times more has\r\nbeen written about Wagner than all that Handel provoked, and even less\r\nhonest investigation has been made--result, a gigantic series of\r\ntales, genuine or mythical, based on what amounts to no authority\r\nwhatever. Unless these are verifiable I leave them to the care of\r\nothers, and pass on. So with regard to Wagner's childhood we know he\r\nshowed himself no wonderful genius. We do know that he lived amidst\r\nfolk whose whole conversation must have been of the theatre and drama,\r\nactors and actresses; that he was petted and taken about by his\r\nstepfather, and as soon as he was old enough, or sooner, went to the\r\ntheatre while rehearsals were going on. \"The Cossack,\" as Geyer called\r\nhim, grew up a lively, quick-witted child, active and full of\r\nmischief, \"leaving a trousers-seat per day on the hedge\" and sliding\r\ndown banisters--much indeed like many other children who afterwards\r\nfor want of leisure neglected to compose a _Ring_ or a _Tristan_. The\r\ntheatrical life, I feel sure, did not differ greatly from the same\r\nlife to-day. It is for the most part a sordid, petty existence, one in\r\nwhich one's days, weeks, months and years are frittered away; they\r\npass and there is nothing tangible to show for them. When performances\r\nare not over until late, no one rises early; then come the rehearsals;\r\nthen the evening performance again--and so home and to bed. Long\r\nintervals of waiting between spells of monotonous work can hardly be\r\nused for anything but gossiping at the stage-door or idling in cafés.\r\nSave for those who have risen high in popular favour--or, during\r\nWagner's boyhood, the favour of kings or their mistresses--it is an\r\nuncertain life, with engagements terminable, and very often\r\nterminated, after a few years; and thus a hand-to-mouth way of\r\ngrubbing along is generated, and a vagrant spirit developed: and in\r\nthe majority, the huge majority, of cases lives spent in squalor, mean\r\nsquabblings, spells of mechanical work alternating with enforced\r\nidleness, end in destitution and utter misery. Uncle Adolph was quite\r\nright: he knew how close the ordinary actor and opera-singer was to\r\nthe _cabotin_. But Geyer, we must remember, was very far away indeed\r\nfrom the _cabotin_. Good-natured and sociable as he seemed, he must\r\nhave held to his purpose with iron determination and stuck to his\r\nwork; and whatever Richard and his brothers and sisters may have seen\r\ngoing on around them, we may be sure they saw none of it in their own\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1817 Weber arrived at Dresden to set up a real German opera,\r\nit seemed he must have landed in exactly the wrong place to carry out\r\nhis plans. Only by a series of miracles did they get partially carried\r\nout; and here, as we know, he composed two works, _Der Freischütz_ and\r\n_Euryanthe_, destined in after years to exert greater power over\r\nRichard's genius than any other music save Beethoven's--a power not\r\ninferior to that of Beethoven's music in some respects. Weber\r\ninevitably became a friend of the Geyers, and before Richard was much\r\nolder he knew the great person to speak to and set him up in his heart\r\nas a demi-god. But as yet Richard was only picking up a little\r\nknowledge and trying, very faintly trying, to play the piano.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Geyer's health was failing, though no one then foresaw what\r\nwas to come. He acted, he painted, he wrote plays, he saw to the\r\ndebuts of Albert and Rosalie; he tried a cure here and a cure there.\r\nIn 1821 he moved to a larger house at the corner of the Jüdenhof and\r\nthe Frauengasse, and rejoiced to have a larger studio for his\r\npicture-work. In July he went to Breslau and returned ill, tried\r\nPillnitz and came back appearing a little better, and promptly got\r\nworse. On the evening of September 29 he heard Richard strumming the\r\n\"Jungfernkranz,\" and asked his wife whether it was possible the boy\r\nhad any gift for music; the following evening he died. The next\r\nmorning Richard was told by his mother that his father would fain have\r\nmade something of him; and, like young Teufelsdröckh, Wagner for long\r\nfancied something would be made of him.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nSo, less than eight years after, Ludwig Geyer followed his friend Carl\r\nFriedrich Wagner to the grave, like him to a premature grave. He left\r\nonly one child of his own, Augusta Cäcilie (born February 26, 1815);\r\nbut he made Friedrich's widow his wife and her children were as his\r\nchildren; and he toiled hard for their comfort and planned unceasingly\r\nfor their welfare; and when on an October morning he was left in his\r\nlast peaceful home to rest, it must have seemed to his widow as though\r\nhappiness was to be denied her until she joined him. The winter of\r\n1813 had been black enough, but at once she had Geyer; in 1821 there\r\nwas no second Geyer. Adolph Wagner may have seen in the tragedy a\r\nmarked instance of the folly of having anything to do with the stage\r\nor actors. Possibly he did not realize that precisely through Geyer's\r\nconnection with the theatre, and only to a comparatively small extent\r\nby means of his reputation as an artist, his sister-in-law and nephews\r\nand nieces suffered less than might have been anticipated. For on the\r\nmorning following Geyer's death Rosalie swore to take his place as\r\nprovider for the family, and that promise she kept.\r\n\r\nWhen Richard was six months old, fate, as we have seen, struck her\r\nfirst blow, placed the first obstacle in the path of a successful\r\ninfantile career, and swiftly sent Geyer to his aid. Now, when he was\r\njust turned eight, she snatched away Geyer, and had already Rosalie in\r\nreadiness to help him. And, in fact, throughout Wagner's life fate\r\nseemed never to tire of delivering staggering blows with one hand, and\r\nwith the other hand, at the same moment or a moment later, giving him\r\ncompensation, often ample, sometimes on a scale of lordly generosity.\r\nFrom the beginning to the end of his seventy years no man ever had\r\nworse or better luck than Wagner. It is perfectly clear that fate\r\nmeant him to write the _Mastersingers_ and _Tristan_, and at times she\r\nwas cruel to him only to be kind to humanity. It is true she seems to\r\nhave made a mistake when she allowed him to complete _Parsifal_--but\r\nthat matter lies as yet many chapters ahead.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that Frau Geyer had a pension of some sort; since May\r\n1 Rosalie had been engaged with the Royal Court players of Dresden;\r\nAlbert and Louise both had engagements at Breslau--one of Geyer's last\r\nacts had been to see Albert safely fixed there; it is probable, if not\r\ncertain, that Adolph Wagner--who, after all, was fairly well off--lent\r\na helpful hand: and the family, if not in the modest affluent\r\ncircumstances they enjoyed while Geyer lived, at any rate tasted none\r\nof the bitterness of poverty. Glasenapp states that Geyer's \"stock of\r\npictures\" had gone up in value after his death; but as he just\r\npreviously tells us of Geyer's lack of time and of \"would-be sitters\"\r\nwaiting their turn, we cannot see how the stock can have been very\r\nlarge. Let us hope, however, that it was, and that Geyer in his grave\r\nwent on helping those he loved. Julius was safely bestowed at\r\nEisleben; and the widow had Clara, Ottilie, Richard and Cäcilie to\r\nlook after--quite enough, it is true, and calling for all the\r\nresources of her housewifery to make ends meet; but, still, nothing\r\nlike the burden Geyer had taken up so courageously a few years before.\r\nHow much Rosalie and Albert could spare out of the small salaries paid\r\nin those--and still paid in these--days by German theatres is a matter\r\nentirely for conjecture: it cannot have amounted to a mighty sum, the\r\nmain point is that it served. I deal with these details, because at\r\nthe first glance one is puzzled to know however the family managed to\r\npull through at all and avoid the workhouse.\r\n\r\nAt first Richard was sent to his step-uncle Geyer at Eisleben, where,\r\nhe himself says, he did little in the way of learning. Geyer tried to\r\npersuade him to work at his books and sent him to a school kept by one\r\nAlt, promising him he should go to the Kreuzschule at Dresden; but he\r\nhad grown too fond of doing his reading on out-of-the-way lines; he\r\nwas fond also of roaming the countryside. There was endless trouble in\r\ndiscovering what to do with him and what to make of him. At last a\r\ntime came when Uncle Geyer could no longer keep him; and in response\r\nto inquiries Uncle Adolph answered virtually that he could and would\r\ndo nothing. So towards the end of 1822 Richard was sent home to\r\nDresden, and there on December 2 he was entered at the Kreuzschule as\r\nRichard Geyer. This, let me remark in passing, was and is common\r\nenough when a widowed mother has married a second time. Several such\r\ncases are within my own experience; and malicious snarls at Wagner's\r\ndouble name, as though at some period he had gone under an alias, are\r\npurely futile and worthy only of an advocate with a desperate case.\r\n\r\nWith this Wagner's period of infancy ends and he enters on that of\r\nboyhood--his life begins. Henceforth we shall hear less of other\r\nmembers of his family--though they will by no means drop out of the\r\nstory completely, or all but completely, as they did when he came to\r\nhis marrying days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nEARLY BOYHOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nSo far all we can learn about Wagner that is worth knowing amounts to\r\nthis: he was born into and passed his first years in the precincts of\r\nBohemia, where the Bohemian atmosphere was tempered with officialism,\r\ncourt-etiquette, and the influence of a methodical and resolutely\r\nconscientious stepfather. When Richard became a man and wrote on the\r\ntheatre and theatrical life he showed an intimate knowledge of all\r\ndetails hardly possible to one who had not gone through this early\r\nexperience: scores of things that an ordinary educated Englishman\r\nlearns with considerable surprise were to him the merest matters of\r\ncourse. When an English composer resolves to write an opera, in the\r\nspirit in which a sculptor may decide to paint a picture or a\r\nflute-player to play the fiddle, he has to learn all, or as much as he\r\ncan, about the requirements of the stage, and even then if his work\r\ncomes to rehearsal he has to accept corrections and make alterations\r\nat the instance of those who have been through the proper early\r\ntraining. No one had anything to teach Richard in these respects: he\r\nknew by what seems an infallible instinct, but which was mainly the\r\nresult of all he had seen since his babyhood, precisely what was\r\neffective and what ineffective on the stage, what was possible and\r\nwhat impossible. He made no mistakes; even the \"impossibilities\" of\r\nthe _Ring_ proved feasibilities and are now accomplished nightly\r\nwithout trouble in every opera-house of Europe.\r\n\r\nThis training--for it was a training, perhaps the very best for the\r\ncareer before him--now went on as in Geyer's time. He still dwelt in\r\nBohemia, but as the influence of his stepfather had been salutary, so\r\nnow to an extent came in the influence of school. Hitherto we have had\r\nrather to consider his family than him; but now the little\r\nindividuality begins to emerge, more and more clearly and distinctly,\r\nfrom that circle. He begins an independent existence, controlled in an\r\noverwhelming degree by the life of the theatre and home-life, but also\r\nleading a life of his own at school and very wilfully taking a line or\r\nlines of his own there. We can now begin to trace the growth of the\r\nmental, and especially the artistic, nature of one of the most\r\nstupendous geniuses the earth has produced. It is altogether\r\nunnecessary to try to piece together anything approaching an elaborate\r\nsketch of the activities and escapades of these days: this would\r\ninvolve laying violent and liberal hands on the fruits of the labours\r\nof Glasenapp and a dozen other pickers-up of unconsidered trifles,\r\nwould yield us nothing essential and might drive the reader to an\r\nuntimely end. Out of the strangely tangled skein of truth and obvious\r\nfiction which is called his \"life\" for this period I shall endeavour\r\nonly to pick out such threads of fact as seem to me helpful.\r\n\r\nRichard remained five years at the Kreuzschule and took to the\r\nclassics with avidity. The best part of his education was classical.\r\nTrue, he learned enough arithmetic to know how many marks made twenty\r\nand how many francs a louis; but the classics provided him with the\r\npabulum his growing mind hungered for. His Greek professor took a\r\nspecial interest in him, which is not surprising when we remember that\r\nat the age of thirteen he translated twelve books of the Odyssey as a\r\nholiday task. Besides this he worked at philology and the ordinary\r\nschool curriculum. It is just possible--just, I say--that had the\r\nfamily remained longer in Dresden he might never have turned to the\r\nScandinavian sagas at all, but have become an eminent scholar and the\r\ncomposer of mediocre symphonic music. That, luckily, is one of the\r\nmight-have-beens, and we need not mourn over it. Music he was very far\r\nfrom dropping. He had played a Weber scene while his stepfather was\r\ndying; and he continued to bang away at overtures with such a\r\nfingering, as Mr. Bernard Shaw has said, as of necessity would be\r\nemployed by the average worker at a circular-saw. But the great\r\nawakening was not yet. He had first to give the world the mightiest\r\ndrama ever conceived by the mind of an energetic, bright,\r\nself-confident boy.\r\n\r\nI do not think there is on record a single instance of a great\r\nengineer having manifested artistic preferences in his youth, or of a\r\ngreat painter having misspent his boyhood in making toy machines.\r\nAlways, from the very beginning, the boy unconsciously, without\r\nreflection, instinctively, helplessly, starts away in the direction he\r\nis destined to follow as a man; and though some potential great poets\r\nmay be thwarted and ultimately discouraged and lost to the world, by\r\nfar the more common phenomenon is that of young geniuses overcoming or\r\nbrushing aside or dodging all obstacles at all costs (to themselves\r\nand every one else) and finding their true road, the path nature\r\nshaped them to tread. At the first glance Wagner might seem a\r\nstartling exception to the nearly universal rule; but he is no\r\nexception. The theatre was his first love, and to the theatre he ever\r\nremained faithful: only through the theatre did his genius manifest\r\nitself; apart from the theatre it may be doubted whether he could have\r\ndeveloped into the consummate technical musician of _Tristan_ and the\r\n_Mastersingers_. Music was his second love, music associated with\r\ndrama; and throughout his long career we find him engaged, first, in\r\ngetting his drama true, poignant and effective, and then in allying it\r\nwith music. Third in his affections came philosophy; and at this time\r\nof day it need scarcely be remarked that he always considered himself\r\na bit of a philosopher, and toyed to the last with philosophy and\r\npseudo-philosophy. Reams of good paper and gallons of good ink have\r\nbeen used in writing about the musician, the composer of the most\r\nmagnificent operas in the world; weeks, months, years have gone to the\r\nwriting. But all the paper, all the ink, all the labour, all the\r\nmental effort and sympathy and love seem a bagatelle when we look\r\nthrough the bibliographies and realize how much paper, ink,\r\neffort--not always to be called mental--sympathy and love have been\r\nused up in expounding Wagner's philosophy. The cases of Whitman and\r\nBrowning make a poor show compared with this case. I believe there are\r\nstill some human beings who turn for guidance to Wagner the\r\nphilosopher. Later I shall be compelled to say something about the\r\nsubject. What Wagner's docile apostles say does not greatly matter--in\r\nfact, does not matter at all; what Wagner said does demand a little\r\nconsideration; and we must bear in mind that philosophy and\r\npseudo-philosophy supplied him with the stuff out of which he wove the\r\nword-tissue of his dramas.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThere is not much, then, to detain us during this period. Rosalie and\r\nAlbert had their engagements, Rosalie being the mainstay of the\r\nfamily. On May 1, 1824 Clara made her debut. Uncle Adolph, ceaseless\r\nin objurgations touching every one who had any connection with the\r\ncourt or trade theatres of the day, had to accept the situation; and,\r\napparently in desperation, or because he found life intolerable with\r\ntwo nagging females in the house where he dwelt, quietly went in 1824\r\nand married Sophie, a sister of his friend Amadeus Wendt.\r\nThenceforward he lived in peace at a house called \"The Hut,\" visiting\r\nhis two nagging ladies every day, however. One was his sister,\r\nFriederike, the other Jeannette Thomä. He was a studious, retiring\r\nman, and in the course of time produced some books that are worthless,\r\nor all but worthless, now. Of course the Bayreuth worshippers and\r\nidolizers of the Wagner family will have it that he, being one of the\r\nfamily, was inevitably a man of superlative gifts; but as I have\r\nalready indicated, there is nothing to justify such an assumption. A\r\ncultivated man of sound sense he must have been; and it is true he was\r\nin some slight touch with a few of the stronger artistic and literary\r\nspirits in that very dull and disheartening period; it is true that he\r\ninfluenced, wholly for good, Richard a few years afterwards. When that\r\nis said all is said.\r\n\r\nRichard is said to have studied English, but how much he actually\r\nlearnt I never could ascertain. I have been told with solemn\r\nmysteriousness at Bayreuth that, like the parrot, he could have\r\nrattled off our tongue with tremendous volubility had he chosen; but\r\nthe fact that he never chose lends colour to the supposition that in\r\nreality he had no choice. However, in the original or in translations\r\nhe read Shakespeare; and it may be presumed that he knew Goethe and\r\nSchiller almost by heart. Naturally he determined to rival them. In\r\nthat heyday of the big Romantic movement he just as naturally\r\ndetermined to rival or to beat them by piling terror on terror, horror\r\non horror. At that period the latest word in the theatre was melodrama\r\nof the wildest sort, and a play which did not contain a few murders,\r\nghosts, enchanted woods and haunted castles had not the faintest\r\nchance of success. According to Wagner's own account he made a\r\nhandsome bid for success; for nearly all the _dramatis-personæ_ came\r\nto an untimely end, and a spectre told one, not yet finished off, that\r\nif he moved another step his nose would then and there crumble to\r\npowder.\r\n\r\nWhile this masterwork was in process of construction, circumstances so\r\naltered that Frau Geyer thought it wisdom to quit Dresden and return\r\nto Leipzig. Albert, Rosalie, Louise and Clara were in various towns\r\nfulfilling engagements; she was left alone with the younger children.\r\nIn 1826 Rosalie had gone to Prague; Albert and Clara were in Augsburg;\r\nLouise had been in Breslau, had tried Berlin, then finally took a\r\npermanent post at the theatre in Leipzig. So a move was determined on,\r\nand the family made another migration in 1827. Richard stayed on for\r\nsome time, in connection with his schooling, I presume; then he\r\nfollowed, incidentally taking the most momentous step in his young\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThese five years had been for him profitable. He got the best part of\r\nhis education at Dresden, where he had skilful and sympathetic\r\nmasters; and almost, one may say, without knowing it he had received\r\nan informal musical education which was profoundly to affect him as\r\nsoon as he started writing operas. I mean that he constantly attended\r\nthe opera while Weber was conductor, and Weber, who had been a friend\r\nof Geyer's, used to call at the house to pass the time of day with the\r\nwidow. Richard looked up to him with awe and worshipped every bar of\r\nhis music; and this, together with a knowledge of the road Richard was\r\nsoon to take and of what he was to become, makes one wonder that he\r\nhad not already decided to compose another _Freischütz_. But, as I\r\nhave said, the theatre--that is, the theatre with the spoken\r\ndrama--was his first love; and evidently it had a wondrous hold on\r\nhim, for after spending a rapturous evening with _Freischütz_--first\r\ngiven in Leipzig in 1822--he would return contentedly to his tragedy.\r\nIt took a stronger spirit even than Weber's to awaken the musical side\r\nof his nature. But unconsciously the foundation had been laid, as we\r\nshall have ample reason to understand before long. These years at\r\nDresden, too, are noteworthy, inasmuch as they saw the beginning of\r\nsome friendships, at least one of which was to prove lifelong and\r\ninvaluable to Richard.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWhen the family settled again in Leipzig one Ludwig van Beethoven died\r\n(March 1827), and Wagner heard of this composer, it is said, for the\r\nfirst time. It is all but unimaginable, yet there seems no reason to\r\ndoubt it. After all, that was not an age of halfpenny morning and\r\nevening papers, and if composers were boomed the deed was accomplished\r\ntranquilly in the houses of great society leaders, dukes and\r\narchbishops, and the general public knew little of what was going on.\r\nI dare say even in our newspaper age many a clever boy of fourteen has\r\nnever heard of Strauss or Josef Holbrooke, and Beethoven did not loom\r\nnearly so large before the eyes of the people as these composers do:\r\nthe names of Salieri, Marschner, Meyerbeer, Spontini, Spohr and Weber\r\nwould be much more familiar than his; even in Vienna he was regarded\r\nmainly as a deaf, surly old crank who had the support of highly placed\r\npersonages. So there is the amazing fact: Wagner, who worshipped\r\nWeber's operas, had not, when fourteen years old, heard of the\r\nexistence of a musician a thousand times mightier than Weber. The\r\ngreat hour was at hand.\r\n\r\nFirst, however, he had to pass through a period of boyish disgust and\r\ndisappointment. At Dresden he had been a favourite with his masters,\r\nand had worked hard. His own account of the methods, temper, and\r\nintellectual qualifications of his masters seems to me eminently\r\nreasonable. Their aim was to bring out whatever was best in their\r\npupils. His account of his first masters at Leipzig similarly bears\r\nthe stamp of truthfulness. They were a set of conceited academics\r\nwith only two ideas in the world: first, that they were the very\r\nfinest flower of Teutonic culture; second, that they must so impose\r\ntheir personalities on the boys, so impress them with their ideal,\r\nthat every pupil would carry to his dying hour the stamp of the\r\nculture of the Nicolai school. Utterly unsympathetic, narrow beyond\r\nthe dreams of the narrowest of modern schoolmasters, they were\r\nfrankly, virulently hostile to any one in whom they perceived--as they\r\nalways did perceive with the unerring instinct of stupidity to detect\r\ncleverness--the smallest trace of originality of character, thought or\r\noutlook on life. As a rule they seem to have been successful in\r\nachieving their aim. An old German friend of mine told me he had\r\ncalculated that the Nicolai school turned out in ten years more\r\ncomplete, complacent blockheads than any other school in Germany had\r\nturned out in half-a-century; and my friend gave me many notable\r\ninstances of men who had soon won the proud distinction of being\r\nunmistakable pupils of the Nicolai school. There were rebels, and\r\nWagner makes it clear that he was amongst them. To begin with, he had\r\nbeen in the second class at the Kreuzschule. The more effectually to\r\nimbue him with the Nicolai ambition of becoming a scholar, _i.e._ a\r\npedant, and a complete, if sausage-munching, German gentleman of the\r\nperiod, they degraded him to the third. No doubt there were protests:\r\none cannot believe that Wagner the boy any more than Wagner the man\r\ncould refrain from declamation under a grievance; but with such\r\nimpervious skulls and thick hides protests would be unavailing. The\r\nmischief was done: he was numbered amongst the rebels, the lost souls,\r\nthe unhappy beings who dared to have notions of their own. He\r\nneglected his studies and sought refuge in his drama. I wonder if he\r\nfound, or made, an opportunity of satirizing his precious professors\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nAt home his life cannot have been much better. Good Hausfrau Geyer\r\ncannot have understood where the shoe pinched: she can only have seen\r\nhow he was wasting his time. The tragedy was discovered and there seem\r\nto have been solemn family deliberations regarding the probable fate\r\nof the reprobate. His Uncle Adolph seems to have acted as the great\r\nconsoler. He, at any rate, knew better than to think a boy was on the\r\nway to the bottomless pit simply because he could not get on with a\r\ngang of dull pedagogues. Now and later he lectured Richard in a kindly\r\nif sententious way; and he must have fostered the boy's natural strong\r\nspirit of revolt. Adolph loathed authority, especially the authority\r\nof irresponsible court officials; and in some of his preserved letters\r\nhe lashes these gentry, the scum of humanity and the parasites of\r\ncourts, with scathing sarcasm. His sarcasm had no practical result,\r\nbecause the officials never saw it--if they had they would have\r\nshrugged their fat shoulders and gone to draw their comfortable\r\nsalaries. But he taught Wagner that officialdom is the curse of the\r\nhuman race; and in after years that certainly had some practical\r\nresults--at the moment calamitous to Wagner; in the long run\r\nbeneficial to him and the human race. Perhaps of all forms of\r\nauthority that which Adolph found least tolerable, that which he\r\ntaught Richard to loathe and hate and spit upon, was official\r\nauthority in art matters. Nowadays, when public opinion counts for\r\nsomething, when those who pay the taxes insist on having some small\r\nsay as to the way in which they are spent, the intendant of a German\r\ntheatre is by no means the lordly court-parasite he was once. Yet even\r\nnow he often flouts his paymasters, feeling fairly secure under court\r\nprotection. We can easily imagine the high-and-mighty jack-in-office\r\nhe must have been in Adolph's time.\r\n\r\nWherever he made his power felt it blasted honest art and checked\r\nhonest art endeavour. It was fitting that Richard should have dinned\r\ninto him--as I have no doubt he did--his uncle's views on these\r\nheroes; for later Richard had a fair amount of fighting to do with\r\nthem, and in the end it was he more than any other one man who broke\r\ntheir power for ever by appealing to the great public. This attitude\r\nis due to Richard's preaching and example; and he learnt it from Uncle\r\nAdolph. In one other respect Adolph's influence was good: he opened\r\nout to Richard's vision immense fields of literature that the\r\nyoungster had never heard of. I have previously mentioned that all the\r\nculture of the Geyer family came through the theatre. To this Richard\r\nadded a small school-acquaintance with the classics; and now came\r\nAdolph to show him a huge, truly vital literature--poetry and prose\r\ndealing with the life of our own epoch. Adolph wrote reminding him of\r\nhow finely Weber Had cultivated himself, of his breadth, of his\r\noutlook on history and mankind. It is evident that Adolph, seeing the\r\nirresistible bent of the Wagners towards the theatre, and fearing that\r\nRichard might in time learn to be content with a life of ignorant\r\ntheatre tittle-tattle, did his best to save him, not so much by\r\nwarning him against the theatre--which he certainly knew to be\r\nuseless--as by showing how many great and interesting things the world\r\nholds. The preaching did not fall on deaf ears; and Richard always\r\ndeclared that in this regard he was incalculably indebted to his\r\nuncle. One of Richard's most strongly marked characteristics was the\r\ntenacity with which he held any idea that once entered his mind; and\r\nit is worthy of note that about this period he read E.T.A. Hoffmann's\r\ncollected fantasies and Tieck's _Tannhäuser_. From the first he\r\nunmistakably got the minstrels' contest in his own _Tannhäuser_; from\r\nthe second, Tannhäuser's coming home after being cursed by the Pope.\r\n\r\nSo things went on. Richard's mother, Richard, Louise, Ottilie and\r\nCäcilie formed the household; Uncle Adolph and Aunt Sophie lived not\r\nfar off; and they had plenty of friends. They lived at first in the\r\nPichhof outside the Halle gate and later removed into the town.\r\nRichard wandered about the city, seeking the scenes of his babyhood;\r\nand his mother pointed out to him the spot where she saw Napoleon\r\nrush off, without his hat, to make his: escape after the battle of\r\nliberation, while Richard was in his cradle. The Rannstadt gate, where\r\nhis grandfather spent his life collecting dues, was still standing,\r\nthough it was soon to vanish; and the house of the Red and White Lion\r\non the Brühl, where Richard was born, was now in the very heart of the\r\nJew quarter. The costumes, speech and gesticulation of these strange\r\nanimals left an indelible impression on him, and were, perhaps,\r\nincidentally responsible for the notorious _Judaism in Music_ of 1850,\r\nand all the fallacies contained in that deplorable essay. Richard got\r\nhis own way in most things, and the seeds were sown of the\r\nself-confidence, egotism, selfishness--call it what you will--that was\r\nto carry him through unheard-of difficulties and troubles in later\r\nlife, and was often, unfortunately, to show as an objectionable, even\r\nodious, feature in his character. He still laboured at his tragedy,\r\nkilling off his personages and turning their noses into dust with the\r\ncareless facility and cheerfulness of buoyant boyhood. He had always\r\nbeen fond of roaming the country, and he continued to nourish that\r\nlove of the pleasant earth which forced him to keep up the habit all\r\nhis life and resulted in the glorious pictorial music of the _Ring_.\r\nHe struggled in vain to conquer the piano-keys, and, indifferent to\r\nthe fable of the fox and the grapes, came to the satisfying conclusion\r\nthat the instrument was not worth mastering. We must remember that\r\nthrough Louise he was in constant touch with the theatre, and it is\r\nevident that he kept up the connection after her marriage to\r\nBrockhaus the bookseller in 1828, for when the theatre was entirely\r\nreformed next year Rosalie came as a principal lady and Heinrich Dorn,\r\nwho speedily became his friend, as conductor. Drama, literature,\r\nschool-tasks, open-air rambles, talks with Uncle Adolph--these\r\nconstituted his life. Now another element was to enter and overwhelm\r\nall the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nEARLY LIFE (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the eighteenth century some enthusiasts at\r\nLeipzig had founded a series of concerts, with a very small orchestra,\r\nwhich were given in \"Apel's house\"; in 1781 they migrated to the\r\nGewandhaus, and by this name the concerts were afterwards known. In\r\nstill later days Mendelssohn became conductor, and for brilliance and\r\nneatness the concerts were famous throughout the world; then Reinecke\r\ncame and they became the most slovenly in the world--in this fine\r\nquality of slovenliness not even our London Philharmonic Society could\r\nhope to rival them; also, as Reinecke was an acrid reactionary, no\r\nmodern music could get a hearing there. However, that did not greatly\r\nmatter; and the world owes the Gewandhaus concerts an everlasting debt\r\nof gratitude.\r\n\r\nRichard, we know, had never heard of Beethoven, had never heard a bar\r\nof his music. At the Gewandhaus the symphonies were regularly played,\r\nand to one of the performances he went, contented, with his head full\r\nof his play, not dreaming of what was to happen to him ere the morrow.\r\nHere are his own words: \"I only remember that one evening I heard a\r\nsymphony of Beethoven's, for the first time, that it set me in a\r\nfever, and on my recovery I had become a musician.\" This is from one\r\nof his stories, but it describes with sufficient closeness what\r\nactually happened. We know that saturated solutions of some salts at a\r\ntouch solidify into a mass of crystals, and as far as intentions were\r\nconcerned this, figuratively, happened to Richard: his purpose was\r\ninstantly set--he would be a musician--nay, he felt he _was_ a\r\nmusician. As to his proceedings, however, a better simile would be\r\nthat of a liquid into which you drop a little of another liquid and\r\nimmediately a violent commotion with much heat is set up. Beethoven's\r\nmusic touched his young being, and a fermentation began which drove\r\nhim forthwith to make himself a perfectly equipped technical musician.\r\nAlmost like Teufelsdröckh and St. Paul, he was \"converted\" in the\r\ntwinkling of an eye.\r\n\r\nThe change was astounding; but Wagner was an astounding genius. The\r\nbald fact is that he was musical as well as dramatic; hitherto the\r\ndramatist in a favourable environment had grown and flourished while\r\nthe musician lay latent waiting his time; but the moment the spirit of\r\nBeethoven spoke to his spirit the musician sprang up and responded.\r\nWeber had been his musical god, but he was now set a little lower, and\r\nBeethoven took his place. When he started to compose seriously it was\r\nWeber and not Beethoven he copied, but that is easily explained:\r\nWagner, like Weber, wrote theatrical music for the theatre, whilst\r\nBeethoven wrote only utterly untheatrical music for the theatre, and\r\nit was from Weber and not Beethoven he had to learn his art of theatre\r\nmusic. But it was from Beethoven and not from Weber that the impulse\r\nto, compose came. He had heard, probably, all Weber's operas without\r\nany desire to go and do likewise; but having heard Beethoven's\r\nsymphonies, and the incidental music to _Egmont_, he at once realized\r\nthat his tragedy would be incomplete without music, and he resolved to\r\nwrite it. Carlyle, overlooking the trifling fact that there is such a\r\nthing as the technique of the novelist's trade, and believing in the\r\nomnipotence of the human will, set out to write a work of fiction; and\r\nwe may imagine his disgust and the sincerity of his objurgations when\r\nthe brute of a novel obstinately refused to be written.\r\n\r\nWhen the incidental music to--whatever the name of his play\r\nwas--obstinately refused to be written, young Wagner may have said\r\nsomething, though it is not on record; but having a finer instinct\r\nthan Carlyle he perceived the necessity of acquiring the technique of\r\nhis new trade. So he got possession of Logier's _Method_; in a few\r\ndays made a complete study of it; then he set to work in earnest\r\n--with, alas! no more satisfactory fruits. Something that might serve,\r\nhowever, was achieved, and the ambitious composer went on to a fresh\r\nstruggle. He had heard Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony, so, taking\r\nGoethe's _Laune des Verliebten_, he started a kind of fantasia,\r\nconcocting words and music together. An account of Wagner's youth\r\nwould be incomplete without some mention of these brave doings; they\r\nshow clearly how strong the instinct which led him on to the _Ring_\r\nwas in him at this early time--to what an unusual degree the child was\r\nfather of the man. But to take seriously his tragedy and these first\r\nmusical attempts, made at the unusually advanced age of sixteen, even\r\nif I had seen them--which I have not: I do not know whether they are\r\nin existence--would be preposterous.\r\n\r\nRichard began to see that he could make no headway, and he persuaded\r\nhis family to let him take lessons from Gottlieb Müller, who must have\r\nbeen a bad teacher for such a boy. Nothing was learnt. Richard was\r\ntold he must not do this and must not do that, and he was not told\r\nwhat he might or should do; in the end both he and Müller grew\r\ndisgusted and the lessons were abandoned. I dare say Müller was in a\r\nhumdrum way a good coach; he could have prepared candidates for our\r\nabsurd academic examinations; but for an artistic genius, bursting\r\nwith inarticulate ideas and inchoate purposes he was worse than\r\nuseless. So Richard had to muddle along as he best might, while his\r\ngood relatives doubted whether he would ever be able to do anything at\r\nall, until by good fortune he tried Theo. Weinlig. Weinlig saw what\r\nwas wrong and what was wanted; instead of Müller's \"you must not do\r\nthis or that: it is against 'rule,'\" he explained matters and showed\r\nRichard that if he once learnt the tricks of the trade he would be\r\nable to compose just as he liked; in six months Richard had become an\r\nexpert contrapuntist and could fugue it with students who had toiled\r\nfor years. \"Now,\" said Weinlig at the last, \"you will probably never\r\nwant to write a fugue, but the knowledge that you can will give you\r\nconfidence.\" According to the late Mr. Dannreuther his words were,\r\n\"You have learnt to stand on your own legs.\" So it came to pass that\r\nRichard's ambition was fulfilled: he was a musician.\r\n\r\nIn the life of a being so extraordinary as Wagner it is not surprising\r\nthat he took many steps, each of which seemed the most momentous in\r\nhis career; but I think on the whole we must reckon this one, from the\r\namateur enthusiast to the fully equipped professional musician, the\r\nmost important. How long he would have been about it but for Weinlig's\r\ntimely aid cannot be said. He was steeping himself in Beethoven. He\r\ncould not play the piano, but he could read scores: Heinrich Dorn\r\ndeclared that he copied those of the overtures with his own hands. He\r\narranged the Ninth Symphony and offered it to Schott, who declined it,\r\nof course. Another arrangement, for four hands, was afterwards\r\naccepted by Breitkopf, in exchange, it would seem, for a copy of the\r\nfull score of the same work. Possibly he had borrowed the copy he\r\nworked from--or thumbed it until it fell to pieces. Dorn said he never\r\ncame across such a Beethoven enthusiast, and he felt sure something\r\nwould come of it. We know something did come of it. Weinlig had taught\r\nhim the principles of musical form as well as harmony and\r\ncounterpoint, and thus made the grasping of the plan of each\r\nmasterpiece an easier task; and to Weinlig the world owes a huge debt\r\nof gratitude. Richard acknowledged the debt; and after Weinlig's death\r\nin 1842 he dedicated _The Love-feast of the Apostles_ to his widow.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nRichard, when he was some years older, said bluntly he cared little\r\nfor his family; and some of the Wagner-mad Bayreuth host point out\r\nthat the family did little for him and did not understand him. One\r\nmight ask why they should be expected to do much: they had plenty to\r\ndo in looking after themselves. But no questions and no appeals to\r\nsweet reasonableness are needed, for the very patent fact is that his\r\nfamily helped him to the uttermost limit of their means. Geyer first,\r\nhis widowed mother afterwards, then Rosalie and his brother Albert,\r\nwithout a doubt Louise--all did their best to make his young existence\r\ncomfortable and happy. He got a much better education than in that\r\nepoch fell to the lot of the average student belonging to a family of\r\nsuch straitened means; when he wanted lessons in music he got them,\r\nand if the family did not pay for them I don't know who did. He was\r\nfed, clothed and apparently provided with pocket-money to hold his own\r\nwith his fellow-students until at the age of twenty he began to earn a\r\nlittle money for himself; and it was Albert who gave him his first\r\nappointment. Long after then he drained their resources and the\r\nresources of the families into which his sisters had married. Wagner,\r\nas I have observed, was a spoiled boy and was made utterly selfish;\r\nand as years went on and he came to think music the salvation of\r\nGermany, and himself the salvation of music, by a simple logical\r\nprocess he arrived at a conclusion which justified his\r\nselfishness--namely, that it was every one's duty to support him, for\r\nto support him was only to help art and the fatherland. It is all very\r\ncharming, and it makes one rather glad not to be a German. Without\r\nWagner's colossal egotism he never could have got through the\r\ndifficulties he had to face, and his selfishness is the defect of his\r\nquality; but it is pitiable to find writers--Glasenapp, Ashton Ellis,\r\nChamberlain and Wolzogen--sunk so low in abject flunkeyism as to\r\nglorify the defect as the quality.\r\n\r\nIn 1829 a court theatre, as has been said, was opened. Rosalie came as\r\na leading lady, and one Heinrich Dorn came as musical director. Dorn\r\nwas nine years older than Richard at a time of life when nine years\r\nmake an immense difference; but the elder, certainly through the\r\ninfluence of Rosalie, from the beginning took a keen interest in the\r\nyounger. He played Richard's music at the theatre--to his own\r\nconfusion on at least one occasion. Richard had composed an overture\r\nin six-eight time with a fearful stroke of the drum, a _Paukenschlag_,\r\nevery fourth or fifth bar; Dorn played it; the audience grew mirthful.\r\nThat is all. What the motive was for the drum-strokes I cannot guess.\r\nStill, Dorn did not give him up, and performed other and, let us\r\nhope, less ludicrous efforts. Presently I shall devote a page or two\r\nto the compositions prior to his first professional engagement; but\r\nfirst let me set down a few of the needful facts of his outer life.\r\n\r\nThe Paris revolution of 1830 set all youthful Europe in a ferment. The\r\nstudents of Leipzig university were not behind, and though Wagner did\r\nnot yet belong to the sacred circles he mixed much with them, hearing\r\nthem talk and doubtless doing not a little talking himself. At one\r\nstroke, he says, he became a revolutionist; and, within his own\r\nmeaning of the word, a revolutionist he remained all his life. When we\r\ndeal with the period during which his revolutionary ideas got him into\r\nserious trouble it will be time to discuss his views: for the present\r\nwe need only note that the conduct of the Leipzig students in various\r\nriotous scenes that took place filled him more than ever with\r\nadmiration for them, and with a determination to enrol himself amongst\r\nthem as early as possible. He had quitted the Nicolai and gone to the\r\nmore congenial Thomas school; but he would not wait to finish his\r\ncourse there. On February 28, 1831 he had his wish and matriculated.\r\nHe was, I say, spoilt in everything. Most German musicians who\r\nreceived any education worth speaking of at that time got it because\r\nof the ambition of infatuated parents to see their children turn out\r\nsuccessful lawyers or win high official positions, for Germans have a\r\ntouching trust in their government and its power of providing for\r\ntheir children. Richard, however, had no taste either for law or\r\nofficialism--he knew indeed that lawyers and officials are the\r\nparasites and curse of our civilization. He had evidently taken to\r\nheart his Uncle Adolph's admonitions--\"Remember how wide was the\r\nculture of C.M. von Weber,\" etc.; and he entered the university with\r\nthe intention, as he imagined, of acquiring some of that culture. But\r\nI fancy he deceived himself. As a schoolboy, as we have just noted, he\r\naspired to the glory of studentship; having won to that he seems to\r\nhave rested content. Certainly he did no work, attended no lectures.\r\nHis days and nights were devoted to two things, composition and\r\npolitics. With Apel and others whom he used to meet at a café he\r\ndenounced governments, police officials and the rest of it; at home he\r\ncomposed overtures and finally a great symphony in C major. It is hard\r\nto say which of his two occupations he took the more seriously.\r\n\r\nThe artist was growing up strong within him; but the injustice and\r\nrobbery he saw perpetrated on every side of him, the wholesale theft\r\nof Poland by Russian officials--by which I mean the Tsar, his\r\nministers, his generals, soldiers, subservient judges and police--set\r\nhis blood aboil; and I suppose that, like other boys of his years, as\r\nwell as many grown men, he fancied his talk would do something to put\r\nthe world and society right. But in no picture of his life at this\r\ntime that I have come across is there any hint of the poetic\r\natmosphere in which he should have lived. Surely in those days before\r\nhis health broke down, with his fervid imagination, his intimacy with\r\nthe masterworks of music and poetry, he must have drawn in a richer\r\nair than the reek of a Leipzig café, his inner vision must have seen a\r\ndiviner light than the common light of the stodgy Leipzig streets,\r\nwith his inner ear he must have heard a music sweeter than the hoarse\r\narguments of students half-filled with lager-beer. In the accounts of\r\nthis time there is not--to use the phrase colloquially--a touch of\r\nromance. Even his letters are stodgy. My surmise is that just as in\r\nhis boyhood the musical part of his nature lay latent and unsuspected\r\nuntil Beethoven's music awoke it, so now the poetic part lay fallow\r\nawhile, and he worked away at the technical side of his music,\r\nmastering form and conventional development of themes, and in his\r\nleisure spent his excess of energy in talking politics and\r\nmetaphysics. The C Symphony of the period can now be seen by all and\r\nhas often been played; and it supports my view very forcibly. When I\r\nsay there is no hint of Wagner in it I do not mean that the\r\nphraseology does not resemble that of the later Wagner--one could\r\nhardly expect that; I do mean that from _Die Feen_ onward there is\r\nalways atmosphere, always emotion and colour, in his music; while the\r\nsymphony is as bald, as unpoetical, as any mean street in Kennington.\r\nI do not doubt that he had his poetic dreams, because with such a\r\nnature he could not help it; but he must have been temporarily\r\nindifferent to them, absorbed in mastering the purely technical part\r\nof his business. If we compare the letters of the time with, say,\r\nKeats's and Shelley's, it is startling to find him enthusing over the\r\naffairs of the parish and seemingly turning his back on the great\r\nthoughts of life, on life's colour, romance, poetry--call it what we\r\nlike. About the Poles he is enthusiastic and fiery enough. Hundreds of\r\nthese heroes passed through Leipzig, living on charity as they went to\r\ntheir new homes in all quarters of the globe--where many of their\r\ndescendants live on charity to this day. Richard wept over their\r\ngriefs, and got the idea for a \"Polonia\" overture; and his ardour was\r\nsufficiently hot to last out until 1836, when he wrote the work at\r\nKönigsberg. Or it may be that he had forgotten all about the Poles\r\ntill he got into the vicinity of their dismembered country. Richard\r\nhimself confesses to leading a dissipated life during this period; but\r\nprobably he exaggerated when in after years he began to realize the\r\nbrevity of life and to regret wasted hours. His guide, counsellor,\r\nfriend, and, I doubt not, inspirer of most of his great achievements,\r\nPraeger, tells a fine story of this part of his life; and one can have\r\nno hesitation in calling it a pack of lies. On the other hand, forger\r\nthough he was, Praeger is quite as worthy of credence as those writers\r\nwho want us to believe that Wagner as a boy of fourteen had a fully\r\ndeveloped character and clearly foresaw the _Ring_ and _Tristan_ as\r\nthings before him, only waiting to be accomplished. Richard was still\r\na boy, impulsive to the point of madness, a hotheaded fanatic, with\r\nhis character still in the making, his artistic purposes neither\r\ndefined nor capable of being defined. He was not yet a great man. But\r\nhe had the makings of a great man in him; and in the meantime it is\r\nmuch that he gained the affection of most of the people he came\r\nacross. In fact it was as true now as ever it was in later life that\r\nof those with whom he came in contact most became his friends and the\r\nrest his enemies: few could disregard him or remain indifferent.\r\n\r\nHis apprenticeship was by no means run out in 1832. He had written and\r\nheard performed some overtures, and he set to work and completed the\r\nbig Symphony in C major, \"in the style of Beethoven\"; and this done he\r\nwent for a holiday and to gain some little experience in Vienna. That\r\nhe could afford such a trip, when at the age of nineteen he could not\r\ncontribute a penny to the household expenses, bears out what I have\r\nsaid about the assistance he received from his family. He contributed\r\nnothing, and, considering his headstrong temper, only a courageous or\r\nreckless man would have prophesied that he would ever be able to\r\ncontribute anything. However, to Vienna he went, and heard\r\n_Zampa_--many more times than he wished. He heard Strauss' waltzes and\r\nliked them; he saw Raymund's forgotten achievements and waxed eloquent\r\nabout them too. He seems to have learnt nothing but a lively contempt\r\nfor a frivolous people who had forgotten how lately Beethoven had died\r\namongst them--only five years before; a people who danced and made\r\nmerry and went philandering while every hour cholera was carrying off\r\nits tens and sometimes hundreds of victims. He himself was\r\nlight-hearted and gay then; and having seen what there was to be seen\r\nhe went back to Leipzig _via_ Prague. Here he sketched _Die Hochzeit_;\r\nmet Dionys Weber, who had known Mozart, and Tomaschek, who had at all\r\nevents seen Beethoven; and made the acquaintance of Friedrich Kittl, a\r\nfat, double-chinned amateur, just blossoming into a full-blown\r\nprofessional musician, who ten years later succeeded Dionys Weber as\r\nprincipal of the Prague conservatoire.\r\n\r\nHe still had very much to learn. But an Overture in D minor was\r\nperformed at the Gewandhaus concerts on February 23, 1832; a Scena and\r\nAria were sung by one Henriette Wüst at a \"declamatorium\" in the\r\nHoftheater on April 22 of the same year; a C major Overture was given\r\nat the Gewandhaus eight days later; on January 10 of the following\r\nyear the C Symphony was played at the Gewandhaus after being tried by\r\na smaller orchestral society; an Overture to a preposterous play,\r\n_King Enzio_, in which Rosalie took a part, had been played nightly\r\nwhile the piece ran. I don't know what the \"Scena with Aria\" may be; a\r\n\"declamatorium\" seems to be a fine term for a recitation or evening of\r\nspouting; the C major Symphony was the last work of Wagner's to appear\r\non a Gewandhaus programme. At the same concert Clara Wieck--afterwards\r\nSchumann--played a piano-concerto by Piscio. Reinecke's malicious\r\nidiocy need rouse no bitterness now; but I may repeat that under his\r\ndirectorship these concerts earned the contempt of musical Europe as\r\nthoroughly as did our own Philharmonic Society. Until lately, when\r\none mentioned either, every musician laughed: now both are trying to\r\nrehabilitate themselves, without much success. Both the Philharmonic\r\nand the Gewandhaus represented musical vested interests; musicians\r\nlike Reinecke in Leipzig, and non-musicians like Cusins in London,\r\nowed their handsome incomes to the positions into which good-luck had\r\nthrust them; and we could hardly expect them to show their publics\r\nwhat much abler men were about. It was because Reinecke and Cusins\r\n(and with him J.W. Davison of the _Times_) knew Wagner to be a great\r\nmusician that they \"kept him out\" by the simple plan of saying he was\r\nnot a musician. It was not the truth, of course, and they knew it was\r\nnot the truth; but it is too much to expect truth to be considered\r\nwhen solid incomes are at stake.\r\n\r\nAt the Gewandhaus--and also at Prague, where Dionys Weber ran through\r\na Beethoven symphony as if it was a Haydn _allegro_--Richard got his\r\nfirst lessons in the art of conducting, by a method for which much may\r\nbe said, that is, he first learnt here how the thing should not be\r\ndone. He knew the ninth symphony by heart, and was also entranced by\r\nthe blended loveliness and strength of Mozart's symphonies: played\r\nhere, all the effects and points he could plainly see in the score\r\ndisappeared. He knew better, even thus early, than to think the two\r\ngreat composers capable of writing the kind of academic stuff which\r\nlooks like music on paper and when played sounds like anything you\r\nlike excepting music. He saw that when an orchestra carelessly romped\r\nthrough a movement, paying no heed to expression, to nuances of\r\ncolour, to tempi, it did not really play, interpret, the music; and\r\nsoon his convictions bore very remarkable fruit.\r\n\r\nAt the theatre he learnt the final lesson needed to prepare him for\r\nwriting operas of his own. _Masaniello_ in its way opened his eyes as\r\nmuch as Beethoven's symphonies had done. Not only the bustle, but the\r\nclean sweep of the thing from beginning to finish of each act, with\r\nbrilliant climaxes in the finales, made him stare and gasp in\r\namazement. Weber he admired; but Weber's power lay in the beauty and\r\npicturesqueness of his music: in _Masaniello_ the music made its\r\neffect because of the theatrical skill with which it was used. The\r\nsame thing he felt in _William Tell_. These two men, Auber and\r\nRossini, were masters of the art of writing effectively for the\r\ntheatre. The drama of their operas was not particularly striking nor\r\nlofty, the music did not come near Beethoven's, Mozart's, nor even\r\nWeber's in beauty, but their mastery in writing theatre-music carried\r\nthem through triumphantly. The problem was, then, to acquire their\r\nskill and use it for a high and noble purpose; and this Richard at\r\nonce attempted to do. He planned and wrote the words of _Die\r\nHochzeit_. He laid it aside because Rosalie disliked the plot; but\r\nimmediately he proceeded to another opera, _Die Feen_, which he\r\ncompleted at Würzburg. The book of _Die Hochzeit_ is dated December 5,\r\n1832, Leipzig. On January 10 of the following year his symphony was\r\ngiven; on the 12th he replied to his brother Albert--now singer,\r\nactor and stage-manager at the Würzburg theatre--accepting an\r\ninvitation to stay with him; a few days later he set out, reaching his\r\ndestination towards the end of the month.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWagner had scarcely time to look around him before his brother Albert\r\noffered him the post of chorus-master. The salary was magnificent--£1\r\n(of our money) per month for about six months in the year; the work\r\nwas hard. We need only note with regard to it that he here heard, and\r\nin the process of drilling his choristers undoubtedly got to know very\r\nwell, all the popular successes of the day. His own account is that he\r\nliked them; and it is significant that during this period he heard\r\nMeyerbeer's _Robert the Devil_. At the moment it does not seem to have\r\naffected his compositions; but in a very few years Meyerbeer's\r\nexample, if not his music, had a most marked influence in shaping his\r\ncareer. For the present he worked at _Die Feen_, and as soon as the\r\ntheatre closed and Albert and his wife went elsewhere to perform in\r\nthe off-season--just as German, French, Italian and American singers\r\ncome to Covent Garden now during the summer--he had plenty of time. By\r\nNew Year's day of '34 the work was complete. Parts of it were rendered\r\nby some Music Union; but soon Richard left Würzburg, having gained\r\nmuch experience if not any money. He was offered a post at Zurich;\r\nbut though that town was destined to be his home for years long\r\nafterwards, it evidently did not tempt him then, for he returned to\r\nLeipzig.\r\n\r\nHere at once began one of those squalid intrigues which drive serious\r\nopera-composers crazy. Several of Richard's pieces had been played; he\r\nhad occupied one responsible position and been asked to take another;\r\nhe had the finished score of his opera; and he was young and by nature\r\nsanguine to the verge of lunacy. He thought he had only to call on the\r\nIntendant of the opera with his masterpiece and its production would\r\nbe assured. He did call, and soon he received a promise that his work\r\nwould be done. But Leipzig was now Mendelssohn's stronghold and no\r\nrival could be tolerated. One of the great man's friends and admirers,\r\nHauser, determined that the work should not be done. He opined that\r\nWagner did not know how to compose nor how to orchestrate; he found\r\nthe music lacking in warmth. This from a worshipper of Mendelssohn\r\nseems a little amusing to-day; but it had a result bad for Wagner in\r\n1834. Underground work went on; and while Wagner waited with what\r\npatience he could muster--and I expect that was not much--hoping every\r\nday to hear that rehearsals had commenced, his score was quietly put\r\non the shelf. This experience falls to the lot of every writer of\r\noperas and is so commonplace an incident that I should do no more than\r\nbarely mention it did not many followers of Wagner see in it the\r\nbeginning of that \"persecution by the Jews\" of which we heard so much\r\na few years ago. It appears to me nothing of the kind. The Jews did\r\nnot at that date particularly single out Wagner for attack: merely\r\nthey defended their vested interests exactly as the musical profession\r\nin England defended and still defends its vested interests. It should\r\nbe remembered that he had quite as many friends as enemies amongst the\r\nHebrews; and I never could understand how, to mention only two, two\r\ngreat conductors and intimates of Wagner, Mottl and Levi, could\r\ntolerate all the nonsense talked on the subject at Bayreuth. When\r\nBrendel published the notorious _Judaism in Music_ it is true many\r\nJewish journalists began to libel Wagner: it is true also that some\r\nJewish professors in the Leipzig conservatoire petitioned that Brendel\r\nshould be dismissed; but these were the shabby acts of individuals,\r\nand far too many shabby acts were perpetrated by Richard's partisans\r\nfor it to be desirable for _them_ to raise the cry of persecution.\r\nPerforce I must say a few words more on this disagreeable topic when I\r\ncome to deal with the Meyerbeer-Rienzi episode; but I promise the\r\nreader to cut it as short as may be. Once for all, despite all\r\nprotestations, despite Wagner's honest belief to the contrary, I\r\ndismiss the Jewish conspiracy theory as rubbish.\r\n\r\nRichard's health was in no way injured by the breakdown of the\r\nnegotiations. His letters of the period are as buoyant as could be\r\nwished. He had other schemes. At the Freemasons' concerts his _Die\r\nFeen_ overture made a hit. He heard Schröder-Devrient in Bellini's\r\n_Montechi e Capuleti_, and found to his astonishment that a great\r\nsinger could create great artistic effects in music of no very high\r\nvalue. He had many friends, and amongst them Schumann and Heinrich\r\nLaube--the latter a free-thinking journalist whose utterances so\r\nscared the government-by-police, as tending to make people think for\r\nthemselves instead of peacefully submitting to be governed, that he\r\nwas put in prison. He was editor of a paper called the _Zeitung für\r\ndie Elegante Welt_--- a curious title for a journal which frequently\r\npraised the democratic Richard. In the summer of 1834 he went for\r\nanother holiday, this time to Teplitz, where he sketched _Das\r\nLiebesverbot_, his second opera to get finished and the first to be\r\nperformed--performed, by the way, in a very unusual fashion. Obviously\r\nhis spirits were not damped: obviously, also, the family which is\r\nsupposed not to have assisted him assisted him to the extent, at any\r\nrate, of enabling him to take a holiday he could not pay for. He had\r\nas yet not earned sufficient for his travelling expenses from Leipzig\r\nto Würzburg and back, to say nothing of holiday trips. As on this trip\r\nhe planned _Das Liebesverbot_ his thanks were due to his family for\r\nbeing able to begin that work. It is true he had Apel as a friend, but\r\nhe had not yet formed the habit of borrowing right and left, nor is\r\nthere any hint in his correspondence of Apel having paid his expenses.\r\n\r\nI wish now to pass rapidly over two fresh adventures--the\r\nconductorship at Magdeburg and that at Königsberg; but first let me\r\npoint out how the boy's was changing to a man's character. It is\r\nplain that he worked very hard at Würzburg, for the score of _Die\r\nFeen_ is a big one, and teaching his chorus must have occupied many\r\nhours a day. It is equally plain that he set to work with the greatest\r\nvigour on the new opera. Now, Nietzsche declared that Wagner by sheer\r\nwill and energy \"made himself a musician.\" That is pure nonsense; but\r\nit points to an important characteristic--namely, Wagner did not, even\r\nat the age of twenty, trust to inspiration alone, as with his hot and\r\nimpulsive nature we might have expected, but also to unremitting work.\r\nFor the remaining fifty years of his life the labours of each day were\r\nalmost incredible.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAt this point the reader must be asked to bear in mind that the\r\noperatic companies with which Wagner was connected in these early\r\ndays--until he left Riga in 1839 and set sail for Paris _via_\r\nLondon--were unlike anything in existence to-day. Dickens in _Nicholas\r\nNickleby_ and Thackeray in _Pendennis_ gave us pictures of the old\r\nstock theatrical companies, with all their good-fellowship, jealous\r\nrivalries, lack of romance and understanding of the dramatic art, and\r\nabundance of dirt. One has only to read Wagner's accounts of the\r\nenterprises at Würzburg, Magdeburg, Königsberg, and even at Riga, or\r\nto glance at his letters of the period, to see that these concerns\r\ndiffered in no essential from the companies ruled over by Mr.\r\nCrummles and Miss Costigan's manager. Life went on in an utterly\r\ncareless way: the rehearsal for the day over, the company met in cafés\r\nor beer-gardens and stayed there until it was time to move, in view of\r\nthe evening performance; any one who had a shilling spent it, while\r\nthose who had no shillings accepted their friends' hospitality and\r\nhoped for the good time coming. Ladies quarrelled and then kissed;\r\ngentlemen threatened to kill each other in honourable duel and sank\r\ntheir differences deep in lager; one member left, another joined, some\r\nmembers seemed to go on for ever; the great times were always coming\r\nand never came. There was a company of this sort, the head being one\r\nBethmann, that wintered at Magdeburg and in the spring and summer\r\nmonths played at Lauchstädt and Rüdelstadt; and Wagner got the\r\nposition of conductor--the first real position he had yet held, for\r\nthe Würzburg office, after all, was a very small affair. He now went\r\nout to conquer the world for himself; he became nominally\r\nself-dependent, though neither now nor in the future was he really so.\r\nHe did the usual round with his troop, arriving at Magdeburg in\r\nOctober; and arriving there, he tells us, he at once plunged into a\r\nlife of frivolity. This may be true, but we must again note the\r\nstupendous industry which enabled him to finish _Das Liebesverbot_ in\r\nso short a time. The most important event in Richard's life about this\r\ntime was his engagement to Minna Planer. She is said to have been a\r\nhandsome young woman; and, as impecuniosity is everlastingly an\r\nincentive to marriage, of course he married her. In the meantime he\r\nthoroughly enjoyed directing all the rubbish of the day, the season\r\nended and he returned to Leipzig.\r\n\r\nThe next season barely began before Bethmann, according to custom,\r\nwent bankrupt; the company disbanded, and Richard was left with a\r\nyoung wife and nothing to live on. An engagement at Königsberg proved\r\nno better; but at last the conductorship of the opera at Riga was\r\noffered to him, so off he went eagerly, never dreaming, we may\r\nsuppose, of the extraordinary adventures that lay before him. Here in\r\noutward peace he was to remain until 1839, rehearsing and directing\r\noperas; but here also he was inspired with the first idea that showed\r\nhe had grown into the Richard Wagner we all know. He toiled away at\r\nthe theatre, nearly driving the singers crazy with the ceaseless work\r\nhe demanded from them; and to his family, when they had news from him\r\nor of him, it must have seemed as though he had already one foot on\r\nthe ladder and it was only a matter of time for him to climb to the\r\ndizzy height of Hofkapellmeister of one of the larger opera-houses. No\r\none, however, who had only known Richard prior to this period could\r\nrealize how rapidly the new environment was to form and ripen his\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nHe was now about twenty-three years of age and a master of his trade.\r\nHe had written two operas and saw little likelihood of either being\r\nplayed--for his advantage, at least. He had composed some instrumental\r\nthings, but he knew that the theatre and not the concert-room was his\r\nvocation. He must have reflected that even writers of successful\r\noperas had died in poverty, either utterly abject, as Mozart died, or\r\ncomparative, as Weber died. On the other hand Rossini had made a\r\nfortune and Meyerbeer was making one. What then? Well, Wagner wanted\r\nneither to die poor nor to die at all: all his life he claimed from\r\nthe world luxuries as a right. He felt his powers at least equal to\r\nRossini's and far superior to Meyerbeer's (though at this time he\r\nranked Meyerbeer high). His artistic conscience was not so sensitive\r\nas it afterwards became: he actually liked the sparkling French and\r\nItalian stuff which was so popular. So, then, he would challenge\r\nMeyerbeer on his own ground! And as all the musical fashions had to\r\ncome from Paris he would go to Paris and make a bid for fortune. Such\r\nmust have been the process of reasoning which led Wagner to take his\r\nfirst great step in life.\r\n\r\nFor the present it is sufficient to say that out of Bulwer Lytton's\r\nnovel _Rienzi_ he took material to weave a libretto that would afford\r\nopportunities for a great spectacular opera; and set to work and wrote\r\ntwo acts of the music. Finally he took ship from Pillau to London,\r\nbringing with him his wife and dog, with the intention of reaching\r\nParis ultimately. And on that journey I must leave him for the\r\npresent, pausing a little to consider the music he had composed up to\r\nthis time (not including the incomplete _Rienzi_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nJUVENILE WORKS\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the exception of _Die Feen_, nothing composed by Wagner prior to\r\n_Rienzi_ calls for serious attention, nor would receive any attention\r\nwhatever were not the author's name Wagner. He himself did not\r\ndistress his soul about the fate of his early works: he knew too well\r\ntheir value; but when a Wagner cult came into existence these things\r\nof small importance were acclaimed, one by one as they came to light,\r\nas things of, at any rate, the highest promise. Not even that can\r\njustly be claimed for them. _Die Feen_ has a certain atmosphere and a\r\nset artistic purpose which may, in the light of his subsequent\r\nachievements, be taken as an indication, a small hint, that the\r\nsubsequent achievements were possible. So much, but not more, may be\r\nconceded. _Das Liebesverbot_ is known to me only from descriptions and\r\nbrief quotations, but these suffice to show that here is not the true\r\nWagner. Of the orchestral music--the overtures and the symphonies--I\r\nhave heard oftenest and studied most closely the C major Symphony. Let\r\nus take it first.\r\n\r\nAlready I have referred to the absence of what, in the popular\r\nacceptation of the word, might be called the \"romantic\" element in\r\nWagner's daily life during this period, and the symphony supports my\r\nsuggested explanation. In the letters, in accounts written by Dorn and\r\nothers, we find fire, enthusiasm, even a good deal of blatherskite and\r\nwild vapouring, but scarcely a hint of \"poetry,\" of the special\r\npoetical sense, of the poet's outlook on life: and in his music he was\r\nchiefly occupied in mastering the technical side of the craft,\r\nassimilating, and at the same time emancipating himself from, the\r\nlessons with Weinlig, and, absorbed in the task, simply letting\r\nromance, poetry, imagination, fancy and the rest go hang; his\r\npractical outward life was devoted to talking what he thought was\r\npolitics and drinking lager.\r\n\r\nThough the symphony is worth looking at because it shows how far\r\nWagner had then got, the general interest in it has for thirty years\r\nbeen its history. It has led to a deal of unnecessarily acrimonious\r\nand barren dispute. Wagner's disagreeable diatribes aimed subsequently\r\nat the Jews were, and are, in part attributed to Mendelssohn's\r\nbehaviour regarding it. It was sent to Mendelssohn; and that\r\nindustrious gentleman never referred to the subject. Wherefore we are\r\nasked two things--to contemn the Jew and accept the symphony as a\r\nmanifestation of tremendous genius. Possibly Mendelssohn never clapped\r\neyes on the symphony. Had he done so, one would have expected him to\r\npay Wagner a superficial, insincere compliment about the score, and\r\nimply that something might be done, etc. We have Richard's written\r\nword for it that Mendelssohn never referred to Wagner's work. All the\r\nsame, what I believe may have been the case, and what Wagner most\r\ncertainly would not have believed to be the case, is that Mendelssohn\r\nsaw it, and saw nothing in it, and put it on one side, and totally\r\nforgot it. The symphony was lost for long years; but some one\r\ndiscovered the parts somewhere, and a score was made, and at the very\r\nend of his life Wagner directed a private performance of it. He\r\ndismissed it with a humorously disparaging remark, and we need have\r\nheard no more about it, had not sundry gentlemen who refuse to accept\r\nany Wagner save the inspired prophet of their own imaginings insisted\r\non having it performed in public.\r\n\r\nI have, I say, heard it fairly often and beg to testify that it is a\r\nmiracle of dullness. The themes are not good of their sort, the sort\r\nbeing, as he said, the sort that are useful for contrapuntal working.\r\nThat working is coldly mechanical, and is not distinguished either by\r\nlightness or by sureness of touch. A dozen of Mendelssohn's pupils\r\ncould have done as well or better. In the andante their is neither\r\ngrace nor feeling: the music does not flow spontaneously, but is got\r\nalong by a clockwork tick-tick rhythm. The best stuff is in the\r\nfinale. Here we find at least sturdiness if not much character.\r\n\r\nThis criticism of his boyish work is not a disparagement of Wagner:\r\none might as well, indeed, disparage Shakespeare, or Beethoven, or the\r\nsun and all the stars in heaven. The symphony tells us, as plainly as\r\nwords could tell, two things. First, that as far as craftsmanship is\r\nconcerned he fell between two stools: had his aim been lower, it would\r\nhave been also less confused, and the result would have turned out\r\nbetter. That is, had he thought only of composing a well-constructed\r\nsymphony, with skilful, easy-running counterpoint, he might have\r\nproduced a more obviously clever if more superficial work. That aim\r\nwas missed by the fact that the Wagner who knew Beethoven by heart was\r\nnot at all content to achieve mere cleverness: he, too, wanted to\r\nwrite a great symphony. But that ambition also was vague and robbed of\r\nits force by his instinctive struggle to acquire a thorough technique.\r\nSo he showed himself neither a great poet-composer nor a contrapuntal\r\nadept. The second fact so plainly stated in the symphony is that he\r\nhad not discovered what was to be the real driving force of his\r\ninvention throughout his creative career--the inspiration of a\r\ndramatic or pictorial (not poetic) idea. The poetic idea is the\r\ninspiration of the composer of pure, \"absolute,\" music--the poetic\r\nidea which is interpenetrated by the musical idea, the musical idea\r\nthat is interpenetrated by the poetic idea, the two being one and\r\nindivisible. As this book proceeds the reader will see how, before\r\nWagner could shape fine music at all, he needed the\r\npictorial-dramatic-musical idea (if so cumbrous a phrase may be\r\nallowed). From the very first he never succeeded in the attempt to\r\ncompose pure music of notable quality. As years went on he tried again\r\nand again, but only such things as the _Kaisermarsch_, the\r\n_Huldigungsmarsch_ and the _Siegfried Idyll_ are of any value, and\r\nthese, we may note, were meant to be played in a quasi-theatrical\r\nenvironment. Immense crowds, flags, waving banners, uniforms,\r\nflashing swords, snorting chargers and so on set Wagner to work on the\r\nfirst as surely as the picture of the Hall of Song suggested the march\r\nin _Tannhäuser_; the same is the case with the second; the _Siegfried\r\nIdyll_, of course, was written for performance at the bedroom door or\r\nwindow of Madame Cosima on that lady's birthday. A distinct picture\r\nwas in the composer's mind's-eye; and besides, the themes came out of\r\nan opera already composed.\r\n\r\n_Die Feen_--_The Fairies_--is based on a version of the child's tale\r\nof _Beauty and the Beast_, Gozzi's _La Donna Serpente_. In Gozzi's\r\nform a lady is changed to a serpent: the handsome and valiant prince\r\ncomes along and all ends well. Wagner had not then dreamed of the\r\n_Nibelung's Ring_ with its menagerie of nymphs who could sing under\r\nwater, giants, dwarfs, bears, frogs, crocodiles, \"wurms,\" dragons and\r\nbirds with the gift of articulate speech; and he would have nothing to\r\ndo with the serpent. The lady must be changed into a stone. Further,\r\nWagner had now got hold of the notion that haunted him for the rest of\r\nhis life--a notion he exploited for all it was worth, and a good deal\r\nmore--the notion that woman's function on the globe is to \"redeem\"\r\nman. So the prince changes the lady back from a stone to a woman, and\r\nthen, like Goldsmith's dog, to gain some private ends, goes mad. The\r\nlady is equal to the occasion: she promptly redeems him--that is,\r\ncures him--and all ends well.\r\n\r\nHere, at worst, we have the picture, or series of pictures, demanded\r\nby Wagner's genius; here also is a dramatic idea of sorts. His\r\nimagination immediately flamed. The music is not like that of the\r\nsymphony, dry and barren wood: on the contrary, it contains many\r\npassages of rare beauty and feeling. There is little of the fairy-like\r\nin it. To Wagner's criticism of Mendelssohn's _Midsummer Night's\r\nDream_ overture, that here we had not fairies but gnats, one might\r\nretort that in his own opera we have not fairies but baby elephants at\r\nplay. But throughout there is a quality almost or quite new in music,\r\na feeling for light, a strange, uncanny light. It is worth noticing\r\nthis, because it is just this sense of all-pervading light which marks\r\noff _Lohengrin_ from all preceding operas. The hint came, it goes\r\nwithout saying, from Weber; but there is a vast difference between the\r\nunearthly light of Weber and the fresh sweetness of _Lohengrin_, and\r\nhere, in his first boyish exploit, we find Wagner trying to utilise in\r\nhis own way Weber's hint.\r\n\r\nFor a boy of twenty the opera is wonderfully well planned. Whether,\r\nhad it been written by Marschner, we should take the trouble to look\r\nat it twice is a question I contentedly leave others to solve. But, as\r\nit is by Wagner, we do take the trouble to look at it many times, and\r\nthe main thing we learn is that from the beginning the composer could\r\nwrite his best music for the theatre, while for the concert-room he\r\ncould only grind out sluggish counterpoint. In addition we may see\r\nthat it is a work of much nobler artistic aim than _Rienzi_.\r\nPreposterous as is the idea of a woman sacrificing herself to \"save\"\r\na man, it is an idea, and it stirred the depths of young Wagner's\r\nemotional nature. In _Rienzi_, as we shall see in a later chapter,\r\nthere is no idea of any sort; that opera did not spring from his\r\nheart, nor, properly speaking, from his head, but simply and wholly\r\nfrom a hungry desire for fame and fortune.\r\n\r\nThe clumsiness of the music is due to several causes. He modelled it,\r\nhe says, upon three composers, Beethoven, Spontini and Marschner--the\r\nsecond and third being by far the more potent influences. Now,\r\ngracefulness is not a characteristic of either of them. Then we must\r\nconsider that Wagner was not yet one-tenth fully grown, and it is the\r\nhobbledehoy who is so heavy on his feet, not the athlete with all his\r\nmuscles completely trained: Wagner needed years of training before he\r\ngained the sure, light touch of _Lohengrin_ and the _Mastersingers_.\r\nHis very deadly earnestness over the \"lesson\" of his opera and his\r\ndesire to express his feeling accurately and logically led to his\r\noverweighting small melodies with ponderous harmonies. The\r\norchestration of the day was heavy. The art of Mozart had been\r\nforgotten; Weber scored cumbrously--as was inevitable; Spontini and\r\nMarschner scored cumbrously also, partly because they could not help\r\nit, partly because they wanted to fill the theatre with sound. Wagner\r\nnaturally followed them. But it may be noted that the orchestration of\r\n_The Fairies_ is not so widely different from that of the _Faust_\r\noverture composed a short while afterwards. A sense of the contrasts\r\nto be obtained by alternating word-wind and strings is peculiarly\r\nhis. Mozart and Beethoven had alternated them, but on the simple plan\r\nadopted in their violin sonatas: in those sonatas the violin is given\r\na passage and the piano accompanies, then the same passage is given to\r\nthe piano and the violin accompanies; in all the symphonies of Mozart,\r\nand the earlier ones of Beethoven, virtually the same plan is\r\nfollowed, strings and wind standing for violin and piano. Wagner from\r\nthe first discarded this mechanical notion; wind and strings are\r\nplayed off against one another, but there are none of these mechanical\r\nalternations, one holding the bat while the other has the ball. On the\r\nwhole _The Fairies_ is very beautifully scored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nPARIS\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe late Sir Charles Hallé, probably retailing a story he had heard,\r\nrelates in his reminiscences that when Heine heard of a young German\r\nmusician coming from Russia to Paris to try his luck with an empty\r\npocket, a half-finished opera and a few introductions from\r\nMeyerbeer--amongst them one to a bankrupt theatre--he clasped his\r\nhands and raised his eyes to heaven, in silent adoration before such\r\nunbounded and naïve self-confidence; and probably he had not then\r\nlearnt the whole truth of the matter. The journey from Riga, _via_ the\r\nRussian frontier into Germany, and thence by Pillau, the Baltic, the\r\nNorth Sea, London, the Channel and Boulogne, is surely the maddest,\r\nmost fantastic dream ever turned into a reality. That he turned the\r\ndream into a reality shows how completely Wagner's character was now\r\nformed: in no essential does the Wagner who built Bayreuth in the\r\n'seventies differ from the Wagner of '39. He had unshakable tenacity\r\nof purpose and perfect faith in his own genius; he was absolutely sure\r\nhe could accomplish the impossible; he took the wildest risks. As a\r\ncreative artist his development had just begun; but the qualities\r\nwhich were in after years to enable him to force his creations on an\r\nindifferent world were all there, ripe and strong.\r\n\r\nThe problem of getting away from Russia was by no means simple, but\r\nmay be passed over in a few words. Wagner's income in Riga had not\r\nbeen large--300 roubles--and it had been mostly swallowed up by his\r\nGerman creditors; and even in the town he managed to owe money. (\"Was\r\never poet so trusted?\" asked Dr. Johnson, referring to Goldsmith). Had\r\nhe given notice of his intended departure his Riga creditors could\r\nhave stopped him; so when the company returned to Riga after their\r\nannual summer series of representations in Mittau Wagner did not\r\nreturn. He made what is, I believe, called a \"bee-line\" for the\r\nfrontier, met there a friend, one Möller, who helped him to dodge the\r\nsentries and patrols, and in a few days reached Arnau. Very little\r\nlater, in July 1839, he, Minna and Robber the dog took ship at Pillau\r\nand set sail for England. The date is one of the most memorable in the\r\nlives of the musicians--quite as worthy of remembrance as the day on\r\nwhich Haydn boarded the packet at Calais. Haydn's powers had been\r\nripened in the sunshine of Mozart's genius, but it is doubtful\r\nwhether, save for England, the twelve great symphonies would have been\r\nwritten; Wagner's powers were beginning to ripen, but it is hardly\r\ndoubtful that the _Dutchman_ would never have been written but for the\r\nvoyage to England.\r\n\r\nIf he could have afforded it he probably would have travelled to Paris\r\nby land. But travelling by land was quite out of the question; money\r\nwas then, as ever, scarce with Richard, and he realized that the\r\nlongest way round was the shortest--nay, the only--way there. He had\r\nover three weeks of life on the ocean wave, and did not like it and\r\nhad no reason to like it. Uproarious storms raged unceasingly; the\r\nship was driven amongst the Norwegian crags for shelter; and the gloom\r\nof these black, forbidding sea-precipices and fiords took possession\r\nof his soul, mixing and giving pictorial shape to the weird old legend\r\nof the phantom sailor doomed for ever to wander on the grey seas.\r\nGlasenapp points out in an admirable passage that Sandwike, where\r\nDaland goes ashore, is the name of the place where Wagner's ship put\r\nin and he and the crew were regaled by a lonely miller with rum. There\r\nis no rum in the _Dutchman_, but the atmosphere, terror and mystery of\r\nthe seas and rocky fiords of Norway are all there; and it was these\r\nthat inspired the _Dutchman_. He knew the tale in Heine's form of it,\r\nand had thought of adapting it; but it was the sea gave the idea birth\r\nin his imagination: without the sea the _Dutchman_ is inconceivable.\r\nThe _Dutchman_, the whole of the _Ring_ and the _Mastersingers of\r\nNuremberg_ are all operas in which the scenic environment is the\r\ninspiration. Depend upon it, ere the ship had freed the Sound, and got\r\ninto the comparative safety of the open North Sea, the _Dutchman_\r\nlegend had formed itself in his mind ready for dramatic treatment.\r\n\r\nUltimately--to be precise, three and a half weeks after getting on\r\nboard--the family reached London, all three spent with sea-sickness\r\nand want of food. They needed and took a rest, first staying near the\r\nTower and then in Soho. There is nothing to relate of Wagner's\r\nexperiences during his first London visit, save the episode of his\r\nlost dog. The late Mr. Dannreuther got the story wrong and has since\r\nbeen faithfully followed by biographers in saying the dog was away\r\nseveral days, and on his return was hugged nearly to death by his\r\nmaster; but in _My Life_ Wagner says the animal was lost for only a\r\nfew hours. But as he was intensely fond of animals all his life--he\r\nalways had two or three about him--the incident must have impressed\r\nhim. Anyhow, when he next came to London, fifteen years after, he\r\nmentioned it to Mr. Dannreuther, and also pointed out to him where he\r\nhad lived and the points of interest he had seen. But nothing of the\r\nslightest significance occurred, and soon he started for Paris by way\r\nof Boulogne. When he reached Boulogne he stayed there a month for the\r\nsake of the sweet company of Meyerbeer--which seems not a little funny\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nWagner was only twenty-six years of age; like a rustic who has\r\nsuddenly been carried out of the dullness and darkness of his village\r\ninto some tawdry café of the town, and is dazzled and mistakes the\r\ngilt wood for solid gold, so had Wagner been filled with admiration by\r\nMeyerbeer's brilliant shoddy. It must be admitted that for sheer\r\ntheatricalism that gentleman beat any composer who preceded him.\r\nBellini's, Auber's and Spontini's scores are thin compared with his;\r\neven Auber's grandest ensembles lack his sham magnificence. Wagner's\r\nartistic conscience had not ripened to the point at which conscience\r\nis an absolute, unfailing, unerring touchstone. He had been impressed\r\nwith Meyerbeer's showiness and superficial sparkle: it had not yet\r\noccurred to him to test the music with the touchstone of truth. It is\r\nnot at all hard for me to believe that he had at this time a sincere\r\nadmiration for the Jewish autocrat of the opera world. He was passing\r\nthrough that stage: he had not yet passed through it; in scheming\r\n_Rienzi_ he had started, so to speak, with an immense rush to follow\r\nMeyerbeer, and for some time the momentum acquired in that first rush\r\nkept him going. When disillusionment came--well, we shall see.\r\n\r\nHe was an obscure German kapellmeister, and had never been conductor\r\nin a theatre which did not suffer bankruptcy or where something worse\r\ndid not occur. Meyerbeer had certainly never heard his name, and\r\nWagner was aware of his: he had heard of Meyerbeer's name, and even if\r\nhe had not admired the musician he cannot at that period have been\r\ninsensible to the man's supremacy in the opera trade. And when we add\r\nto this latter fact, the other fact, that he _did_ admire the\r\nmusician, it is easy to understand the feelings with which he\r\napproached this emperor of the barren Sahara of opera. To the emperor\r\nhe got an introduction--whether or not in the way Praeger relates is\r\nnot worth inquiring into--and the emperor received him not merely with\r\ncourtesy, but with what appears to have been something a great deal\r\nwarmer than courtesy. He hearkened to the two finished acts of\r\n_Rienzi_, and beginning with an expression of admiration for the\r\nbeautiful clear handwriting, presently grew interested in the music\r\nand ended by commending it heartily. Wagner departed for Paris with\r\nthe autocrat's letters in his pocket and, as I have said, little\r\nmoney, but a breast packed with glorious hopes. The most successful\r\nopera-composer of the day had declared that he would succeed, and\r\nguaranteed his belief by giving him those precious introductions. One\r\nwas to the direction of the Grand opera, one to Joly, director of the\r\nRenaissance Theatre, another to Schlesinger, the publisher, another\r\nagain to Habeneck, the director of the Conservatoire. Of these the\r\nletter to Habeneck proved useful to Wagner from the artistic point of\r\nview; that to Schlesinger useful pecuniarily. The others were useless,\r\nand were never meant to be of any service. Had Meyerbeer told Wagner\r\nto go back to Germany it is just possible Wagner might have gone.\r\nInstead, Meyerbeer sent him into a _cul de sac_--to starve, or get out\r\nas he best could. In the whole history of the art of the world no more\r\ncruel swindle was ever played on an obscure artist by a man occupying\r\na brilliant position.\r\n\r\nFor, figuratively, Wagner had not been in Paris twenty minutes before\r\nhe discovered that to be presented by the omnipotent Meyerbeer meant\r\nnothing--absolutely nothing. Every one received him with the greatest\r\npoliteness; every one appeared to promise great things; no one did\r\nanything. At the opera he had not the remotest chance, of course,\r\nbeing young, unknown, a German, and without social influence. The\r\nRenaissance speedily shut its doors, being bankrupt. Through Habeneck\r\nhe learnt to understand the Ninth Symphony even better than he had\r\nunderstood it before; for the Conservatoire orchestra had rehearsed it\r\nuntil, almost unconsciously, they discovered the real melody, or what\r\nWagner calls the melos. This is a question I shall go into later when\r\ndealing with Wagner's own conducting; for the present it suffices to\r\nmention the bare fact, as we can trace directly to these\r\nperformances--or, rather, rehearsals--the _Faust_ overture which\r\nWagner soon afterwards composed. Habeneck gave a performance of his\r\n_Columbus_ overture; and in no other way was the acquaintance of any\r\nvalue. So, as his little money was speedily gone, he had to live for a\r\nwhile on what his relatives and friends could give him, and afterwards\r\nby what he could earn by writing for Schlesinger's _Gazette Musicale_.\r\nThis is what Meyerbeer's introductions were worth.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nHowever, he found and made friends, some, though not all, as poor as\r\nhimself. Laube, his crony of earlier years, was there and introduced\r\nhim to Friedrich Pecht, a student of painting, and to Heine. This last\r\nwas very suspicious of Wagner at first, because he did not believe\r\nMeyerbeer would exert himself on behalf of any one possessing the\r\nslightest ability. It is obvious that he soon discovered that he was\r\nboth right and wrong. Wagner had ability, and Meyerbeer, far from\r\nhelping him, had ingeniously dug a trap to keep a possible rival\r\nquiet. Wagner made the acquaintance of Berlioz, and promptly uttered\r\nthe criticism he adhered to always--one that I humbly subscribe\r\nto--that Berlioz, with all his imagination, energy and wealth of\r\norchestral resource, had no sense of beauty. Berlioz, he remarked,\r\nlived in Paris \"with nothing but a troop of devotees around him,\r\nshallow persons without a spark of judgment, who greet him as the\r\nfounder of a brand-new musical system, and completely turn his head.\"\r\nTo a certain degree this judgment came home to roost in Wagner's later\r\nyears in Bayreuth; but he was saved by the fact that, being a great\r\nmusician, he also drew genuine musicians to him. If Bayreuth was\r\ncrowded by strange beings of low intelligence who bowed low before\r\nRichard and found the weirdest meanings in his simplest melodies, and\r\nwho now write lengthy books about Richard's son Siegfried, yet we must\r\nremember that the men who carried the news of Richard's true greatness\r\nthrough Europe were Liszt, Bülow, Tausig, Jensen, Cornelius and many\r\nsmaller men--smaller men, but real musicians. Now, it was long since\r\npointed out that amongst his entourage Berlioz had no one possessing\r\nan understanding of the art of music. Literary men and painters were\r\nthere in abundance: that is, they called on him; and because his\r\nmusical ideas or ideas for music seemed so vast they assumed that his\r\nmusicianship must be vast also; but those whose judgment would have\r\nbeen trustworthy, and whose help worth having, stayed away altogether;\r\nand when the celebrated personages had paid their call and gone their\r\nseveral ways he was left to the flattery of a pack of incompetent\r\nfools. This is not to exaggerate--it is simply to explain the\r\nloneliness and sad tragedy of the end of Berlioz's life. He must in\r\nhis heart have known the bitter truth. One friend of Wagner's must not\r\nbe omitted--Lehrs. From him Wagner obtained what is called the middle\r\nhigh-German _Sängerkrieg_, from which he extracted ere returning to\r\nGermany the whole world of _Tannhäuser_ and _Lohengrin_; and this we\r\nmust consider later. We may note that his youngest sister Cäcilie,\r\nGeyer's only child, had married Avenarius, who resided in Paris for a\r\ntime as agent for Brockhaus, the Leipzig publisher.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe whole story of this first visit to Paris is sordid, squalid,\r\nmiserable to a degree; and I don't know that we can be surprised. When\r\nWagner sailed from Pillau he had not had a single work of any\r\nimportance performed. Nay, more, he had not written a work of any\r\nimportance. _Die Feen_ had never been given; _Das Liebesverbot_ had\r\nbeen given--under ridiculous circumstances and with the most\r\ndisastrous results; his symphony had been played, but by this time\r\nscore and parts had probably disappeared. Mendelssohn had received\r\nthem in Leipzig and never once referred to them. Anyhow, none of these\r\nthings were striking enough to have attracted much attention even in\r\nGermany; and they certainly would have excited no interest in busy,\r\nbustling Paris--the home of the Rossini and Meyerbeer opera, of\r\nquadrilles, vaudevilles and the rest. But for the happy, or rather\r\nunhappy, chance of meeting Meyerbeer in Boulogne, he would have\r\nentered the city without a line to any one of position. His money, as\r\nI have just said, gave out almost at once, and thenceforth he had to\r\nkeep the wolf from the door by slaving at any odd jobs which would\r\nbring in a few pence. On more than one occasion he was reduced,\r\nliterally, to his last penny. With marvellous resiliency of spirits he\r\nmanaged not only to pull through, but to complete _Rienzi_, then to\r\nwrite one great opera and begin planning two very great ones. We have\r\naccounts--mostly written long after the event--of merry meetings and\r\nsuppers; but against them we must set the dozens of despairing letters\r\nand scribbled notes in which he complains of his luck and his lot.\r\nYet, I say, how can we feel surprise? Why, he could not even play the\r\npiano well enough to give an opera-director any fair notion of his\r\nmusic; and perhaps that is just as well, so far as Paris was\r\nconcerned, for the taste of the day was such that the better his\r\ncompositions were understood the less they were liked. Hallé remarks\r\nthat when he talked of his operatic dreams at this time he was\r\ncommonly regarded as being a little, or more than a little, \"off his\r\nhead.\"\r\n\r\nIt became evident at the outset that all hopes anent the opera must\r\nfall to the ground. He met Scribe, the omnipotent libretto-monger of\r\nthe day, and of course nothing came of it. The spectacle of _Rienzi_\r\nwas on far too large a scale for the work to be possible at the\r\nRenaissance, so, much against the grain, he offered Anténor Joly _Das\r\nLiebesverbot_. He waited two months for a decided refusal or a\r\nqualified acceptance, but heard nothing. At last a word from Meyerbeer\r\nseemed to have settled the matter. One Dumersau, who translated the\r\nwords into French, was very enthusiastic about the music and made Joly\r\nenthusiastic too; everything looked bright for the moment, and Wagner\r\nmoved from the slum where he had been living to an abode a little less\r\nslum-like, in the Rue du Helder. On the day he moved the Renaissance\r\nwent bankrupt again. I say again, because Joly became bankrupt\r\npunctually every three months--a fact which explains Meyerbeer's\r\nreadiness to help him in that quarter. In desperation he seized the\r\nchance of earning a little money by writing the music for a vaudeville\r\nproduction, _La Descente de la Courtille;_ but here again his luck was\r\nout: a more practised hand took the job from him. He composed what he\r\nconsidered simple songs adapted to the Parisian taste, and they were\r\nfound too complicated and difficult to sing. To earn mere bread he\r\narranged the more popular numbers of popular operas for all sorts of\r\ninstruments and combinations of instruments, and in one of his notes\r\nwe find him bewailing the sad truth that even this work was coming to\r\nan end for a time. However, he wrote on for Schlesinger's _Gazette\r\nMusicale_; for Lewald's _Europa_ (German) and the Dresden\r\n_Abendzeitung_--though the work for the second two did not commence\r\ntill later on. This toil perhaps brought him bread: it did nothing\r\nmore; Minna had to pawn her trifles of jewellery; there seemed not a\r\nray of hope gleaming on the horizon. The performance of his old\r\n_Columbus_ overture did him a precious deal of good--especially as at\r\nthe second performance--at a German concert arranged by\r\nSchlesinger--the brass were so frightfully out of tune that people\r\ncould not make out what it was the composer would be at. It is\r\nneedless to tell the ten times told miserable tale in further detail\r\nat this time of day; and I will now confine myself to the few facts\r\nthat bear upon the fuller life that soon was to open before him.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nA new opera-house had been a-building in Dresden, a royal court\r\ntheatre; and a chance in Paris being denied to _Rienzi_, Wagner,\r\nstaggering along under the burden of his crushing woes, thought\r\nperhaps his grand spectacular work would be the very thing to suit the\r\nDresdeners about the time of the opening. True, there remained three\r\nacts to compose and orchestrate--but what was that to a Richard\r\nWagner! Only one other composer has achieved such astounding feats.\r\nMozart, amidst multitudinous worries, sat down and wrote his three\r\nglorious symphonies \"as easily as most men write a letter.\" Wagner was\r\nborn to achieve the impossible: he had already done it in getting to\r\nParis at all; and now, as a sheer speculation, on the very off-chance\r\nof a Saxon court theatre accepting a work by a Saxon composer,\r\nharassed by creditors, despondent under repeated disappointments,\r\ndrudging hours a day at hack-labour, he went to work and composed and\r\ninstrumentated the last three acts of the most brilliant opera that\r\nhad been written up to that date--1841. On February 15 of that year he\r\nbegan; on November 19 he ruled the last double-bar and wrote finis.\r\nThat done, he dispatched the complete score and a copy of the words to\r\nDresden, with a letter to von Lüttichau, the intendant. Again the\r\ndelays seemed interminable; his letters, especially those to Fischer\r\nand Heine, are packed with inquiries about the fate of his opera--he\r\ncould get no answer at all for a long while, and after it was\r\ndefinitely accepted the usual troubles occurred through the whims and\r\ncaprices of singers. Even his idol and divinity, Schröder-Devrient,\r\ngreat artist though she was on the stage, played the very prima\r\ndonna--which is about as bad a thing as can be said of any woman--off\r\nthe stage so far as _Rienzi_ was concerned. Being a prima donna first\r\nand an artist afterwards, she thought nothing of dashing Wagner's\r\nhopes by expressing a desire to appear in some other opera before\r\n_Rienzi_; and as the delay meant a prolongation of the actual misery\r\nand possible starvation at Paris we can picture Wagner's impotent\r\nrage and despair.\r\n\r\nOn October 14, 1841, we find him writing to Heine:\r\n\r\n    \"... Herr von Lüttichau has definitely consented to my opera\r\n    being put on the stage after Reissiger's. That is all very good;\r\n    but how many questions does not this answer suggest! For\r\n    instance: does the general management propose to place my work\r\n    upon the stage with the outlay indispensable to a brilliant\r\n    effect? On this point W----writes me: 'The general management\r\n    will leave nothing undone to equip your opera in a suitable\r\n    manner.' You will understand how terribly terse this seems to\r\n    me! I am not greatly surprised at receiving no letter from\r\n    Reissiger since last March: he has worked for me--that is the\r\n    best and most honourable answer; besides, it would be foolish on\r\n    my part to expect that Reissiger, now that his own opera must be\r\n    fairly engrossing his attention, should be much occupied about\r\n    me. But what alarms me is the absolute silence of our Devrient!\r\n    I think I have already written a dozen letters to her: I am not\r\n    exactly surprised at her sending me no single line in answer,\r\n    because one knows how terrible a thing letter-writing is to many\r\n    people. But that she has never even indirectly sent me a word,\r\n    nor let me have a hint, makes me downright uneasy. Good heavens!\r\n    So much depends upon her--it would really be a mere humanity on\r\n    her part if she, perhaps through her lady's-maid, had sent me a\r\n    message to this effect: 'Make your mind easy! I am taking an\r\n    interest in your affair!'--certainly everything which I have\r\n    learnt here and there about her behaviour with regard to me\r\n    gives me every reason to feel comfortable; for instance, she is\r\n    said to have declared some while ago in Leipzig that she hoped\r\n    my opera would be brought out in Dresden. This token would have\r\n    fully quieted me, if it had only come directly to my ears or\r\n    eyes: hearsay, however, is far too uncertain a thing.\r\n\r\n    \"A month ago I likewise wrote to her, and earnestly begged her\r\n    to let me have only a line with the name of the lady-singer whom\r\n    she would like to be cast for the part of Irene, so that I might\r\n    make a formal list to propose to the management. No answer! Oh,\r\n    my best Herr Heine, if your kindness would only allow you a few\r\n    words in which to make me acquainted with the intentions of the\r\n    adored Devrient! Does she really wish to sing in my opera?--that\r\n    is the question.\r\n\r\n    \"Good heavens! only to know how all this stands! I have written\r\n    to Herr Tichatschek, and commended myself to his amiability:\r\n    shall I be able to count on this gentleman?\"\r\n\r\nAgain, on January 4 of the following year:\r\n\r\n    \"Should it really come to this, that my opera must be laid aside\r\n    for the whole winter, I should indeed be inconsolable; and he or\r\n    she who might be to blame for this delay would have incurred a\r\n    grave responsibility--perhaps for causing me untold sufferings.\r\n    I cannot write to Madame Devrient; for that I am much too\r\n    excited, and I know too well that my letters make no impression\r\n    upon her. But if I have not yet worn out your friendly feeling\r\n    toward me, and if I can be assured that you rely upon my fullest\r\n    gratitude, I earnestly beg of you to go to Madame Devrient. Tell\r\n    her of my astonishment at the news that it is she who hinders my\r\n    opera from at length appearing; and that I am in the highest\r\n    degree disturbed to learn that she by no means feels that\r\n    pleasure in and sympathy for my work which so many flattering\r\n    assurances had led me to believe. Give her an inkling of the\r\n    misery she would prepare for me, if (as I have now good reason\r\n    to fear) a performance of _Rienzi_ could not after all take\r\n    place this year! But what am I saying? Though you may be the\r\n    most approved friend of Madame Devrient, even you will not have\r\n    much influence over her. Therefore, I do not know at all what I\r\n    should say, what I must do, or what advise! My one great hope I\r\n    place in you, most valued friend! I have written to Herr von\r\n    Lüttichau, and herewith turn to Reissiger. If Devrient cannot\r\n    give up her Armida, if she cannot afford me the sacrifice of a\r\n    whim, then all my welfare rests only on the promptness with\r\n    which this opera is brought out, and my own is taken up. I\r\n    therefore fervently pray Reissiger to hurry: and you--I beseech\r\n    you--do the same with Devrient. By punctuality and diligence\r\n    everything can still be set right for me; for the chief thing\r\n    is--only that my opera should come out before Easter (that is to\r\n    say, in the first half of March). I am truly quite exhausted!\r\n    Alas! I meet with so little that is encouraging, that it would\r\n    really be of untold import to me if, at least in Dresden, things\r\n    should go according to my wish!\"\r\n\r\nThese excerpts afford some notion of the struggles and disappointments\r\nof this time--struggles that were to be repeated when, more than\r\ntwenty years later, _Tristan_ and the _Mastersingers_ were produced in\r\nMunich. More need not be quoted, for the story is always the\r\nsame--delays caused by intrigues and the whims and caprice of singers,\r\nand the indifference of inartistic directors.\r\n\r\nIt should be said that Meyerbeer seems, for the only time, really to\r\nhave helped Wagner in getting _Rienzi_ accepted, for a letter of his\r\nto von Lüttichau recommending the opera, has been preserved; wherefore\r\nlet us gladly acknowledge this deed, which was a good, if a very\r\nsmall, one. He again paid a visit to Paris, and this time gave Wagner\r\na word of introduction to Pillet, who had assumed the post of director\r\nof the Opéra. Owing to this introduction the _Flying Dutchman_ was\r\nwritten. Wagner sketched a scenario and let Pillet have it. The\r\ncustomary procrastination set in, and at last Pillet flatly told\r\nWagner he could not produce an opera by him: he was young, a German,\r\nand so on and so on; and in a word he liked the scenario and had\r\ndetermined to have it set by one Dietsch--which is not a very\r\nFrench-sounding name. He offered Wagner twenty pounds for it, and if\r\nthe offer was not accepted--well, Wagner might do what he chose.\r\nWagner took it.\r\n\r\nHe completed his libretto, took lodgings at Meudon, then a lovely\r\nsuburb of Paris, hired a piano and sat down to compose his _Dutchman_.\r\nHe gives a graphic account of his tremors whilst awaiting the piano:\r\nhe feared that during the degrading struggle for bread the power of\r\ncomposing might have deserted him. The instrument arrived, he sat\r\ndown, and shouting for joy, struck out the sailors' chorus. In seven\r\nweeks the draft was complete--it is dated September 13, 1841. Want of\r\nfunds compelled him to leave Meudon and resume his treadmill\r\ntoil--this time in the Rue Jacob in Paris; but he began to score his\r\nopera in the autumn and by the end of the year it was entirely\r\nfinished. He sent it to the Berlin Opera, and at once began to cast\r\nround for another subject. He had demonstrated to his own complete\r\nsatisfaction that grand historical themes were the only useful\r\nmaterial for a thoroughly \"up-to-date\" (date 1842--seventy years ago)\r\ncomposer; and while doing what may be called foraging work he had hit\r\nupon the story of _The Saracen Young Woman_. We may presume that this\r\nappealed to him in a mood of reaction after the intensely personal\r\nquality of the _Dutchman_. That mood sent him back in the direction of\r\n_Rienzi_. About the _Dutchman_ he never had the slightest illusion. He\r\nknew it to be so far ahead of the time that nothing in the way of a\r\npopular success was to be hoped for it. On the other hand, he had\r\nperfect faith--a faith justified by the subsequent event--in _Rienzi_;\r\nand since the Wagner of 1842 was by no means the Wagner of 1862, or\r\neven of 1852, since also he had been half-starved for a couple of\r\nyears and money seemed to him a highly desirable thing, he naturally,\r\ninevitably, was drawn towards a subject which promised as well, from\r\nthe box-office point of view, as _Rienzi_.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is--or was in Wagner's case--a divinity that shapes our\r\nends. Much as he hungered after comforts, luxuries and the flesh-pots\r\nof Egypt, the dæmon within his breast was too strong for him. He had\r\nplanned a new work, more or less on the lines of _Rienzi_, and perhaps\r\nsome lucky or unlucky accident might have sent him the inspiration to\r\nstart with the music. But just at this juncture Lehrs' copy of the\r\n_Sängerkrieg_ attracted his attention: the complete drama of\r\n_Tannhäuser_, and the first vague notion of _Lohengrin_, flashed upon\r\nhim. As he said, and as I have repeated, a new world was opened before\r\nhis amazed eyes. The _Saracen Young Woman_ and the rest all went to\r\nthe wall; and when on April 7, 1842, he set out for Dresden he had\r\ndifferent plans altogether in his head. Before he could start\r\nSchlesinger advanced the money for more cornet-à-piston arrangements\r\nof opera-airs, and he had to take the scores of those operas amongst\r\nhis luggage.\r\n\r\nAs yet I have said nothing about his acquaintance with Liszt. It began\r\nat this time, and of course was destined to have wonderful results,\r\nbut for the moment it was of no importance. Wagner was an unknown\r\ncomposer; Liszt was a world-famous pianist. Wagner, moreover, had\r\nwritten only _Rienzi_ and the _Dutchman_, and was unable even to play\r\nthem on the piano. He probably made only the slightest impression on\r\nLiszt. The incident is worth noticing in this chapter, because, though\r\nthis Paris episode seems to be nothing but a series of disasters, it\r\nis an instance of the good that came of it. Wagner undoubtedly learnt\r\na lot about the stage; he got to know Liszt; he had the world of\r\n_Tannhäuser_ and _Lohengrin_ opened out to him. When he went off to\r\nDresden and touched German soil once more he swore he would never\r\nagain leave his fatherland. But he had learnt what his fatherland was\r\nquite unable to teach him. His friends said his character changed\r\nentirely during this period. Undoubtedly it did change: the Wagner who\r\nhad aimed only at worldly, commercial success, changed into Wagner the\r\nartist whose sincerity carried him through all troubles to the\r\ncrowning triumph--and discomfiture--of Bayreuth. I have referred\r\nbefore to the fact of the old momentum keeping him going in a certain\r\ndirection even after he knew that direction to be a wrong one; and the\r\nsame thing was to occur again, as we shall see in a moment. After\r\nwriting the _Dutchman_ he actually deliberated as to the wisdom of\r\ndoing another _Rienzi_. The claims of his stomach were, naturally\r\nafter a two years of semi-starvation, very strong, and another\r\n_Rienzi_ might have meant easily earned bread-and-butter. But the\r\nParis change was fundamental; and even if he had tried to do another\r\n_Rienzi_ he could not possibly have done it. Without his knowing it,\r\nthe artist in him had triumphed over the merely commercial composer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n'RIENZI' AND 'THE FLYING DUTCHMAN'\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nWere _Rienzi_ an opera of the highest artistic importance, I suppose I\r\nshould have read ere now Bulwer Lytton's novel of that name. As it is,\r\nI must confess my utter inability to wade through that pretentious and\r\ndreary achievement. And it does not matter. Skimming over the novel, I\r\nhave gathered enough of the plot to see that Wagner took only the plot\r\nand nothing else from Lytton. What else he could have taken I cannot\r\nguess, unless it was a copious stream of high-falutin', and at this\r\nperiod Wagner's own resources of the sort were ample. What he wanted\r\nwas a plot that would afford him an opportunity of planning a\r\nspectacular opera on the largest possible scale, and this he found in\r\nLytton.\r\n\r\nTwo claims, or rather, a claim and a counter-claim, have been, and\r\nconstantly are, made with regard to _Rienzi_. The first is that it was\r\ninspired by Meyerbeer and a copy of one of his works--which one I do\r\nnot know; the counter-claim is that Meyerbeer had no part in the\r\nbusiness, and that on the contrary he learnt more from Wagner than\r\nWagner could possibly have learnt from him. Now the notion, I take it,\r\nof composing a grand work for the Paris stage was suggested by\r\nMeyerbeer's stupendous success--of that, indeed, I cannot admit there\r\nis the faintest shadow of a doubt. Starting from Paris, where they\r\nwere concocted together with Scribe, Meyerbeer's operas went the round\r\nof the opera-houses of Europe, and save in one or two quarters\r\nMeyerbeer lorded it over the opera-houses of Europe. It may be true\r\nenough that some of his mighty works had not been played at Riga--it\r\nmay even be true that Wagner had not seen the scores. But that I feel\r\nless sure about; and, anyhow, if he had not seen them he was bound to\r\nhave heard of them. The talk of musical Europe was not likely to be\r\nunknown to a man who both read and wrote in the musical papers. As\r\nsoon as Wagner conceived the idea he wrote to Scribe concerning it;\r\nand, as we know, Scribe quite naturally left his communication\r\nunanswered. We find, then, that this, not more than this, though\r\ncertainly not less, is the extent of Wagner's indebtedness to\r\nMeyerbeer: that Meyerbeer, by writing clap-trap for a large stage,\r\nwith showy, tawdry effects, had gained enormous popularity and\r\ncorresponding wealth, and thus unconsciously had thrown out a hint\r\nthat budded and blossomed into _Rienzi_. How little beyond this bare\r\nhint Wagner got from Meyerbeer we shall see when we examine the music.\r\nA word must be said about the counter-claim. In his age Wagner at\r\nBayreuth, although he had fine musicians as his friends, had round him\r\nmany gentry who told him--greatly daring, to his face--not only that\r\nhe owed no artistic debt to any one, but that, on the whole, most\r\nother composers owed him a good deal. One can excuse the weary old\r\nman, sorely battered in life's battles, lapping up a little of this\r\nsweet flattery; but it is hard to forgive the stupidity that still\r\nmakes the great composer appear ridiculous thirty years after his\r\ndeath. This legend of Meyerbeer borrowing or thieving from Wagner is\r\nsheer rubbish; in all Wagner's music there is not a bar which could\r\nhave been of use to Meyerbeer. The most rowdy tunes in _Rienzi_ he\r\ncould easily equal: anything ever so remotely approaching the\r\nbeautiful he did not want. What! was he to run the chance of failure\r\nby writing, or copying, one really expressive measure?\r\n\r\nIt needed the cruel disillusionment of the Paris days, it needed also\r\nthe time needful for Wagner's normal growth, before he was driven to\r\nsee that the music-drama, or something that ultimately evolved itself\r\ninto the music-drama, was the form that he needed for his deepest\r\nutterances. _Rienzi_ is old-fashioned opera, barefaced, blatant and\r\nunashamed. Wagner wanted effective airs, duets, trios, choruses and\r\nmarches; and no libretto-monger ever went to work in a more\r\ndeliberate, matter-of-fact and business-like way to provide\r\nopportunities for these. Both in _Die Feen_ and in _Das Liebesverbot_\r\nhis purpose had been more definitely, more disinterestedly, artistic.\r\nNow he set to work to manufacture for the Paris market. The subject\r\nwas eminently suitable. The personage Rienzi was intended for a great,\r\nheroic figure and the music written for a brilliant tenor. The\r\nindispensable love-element was provided by Irene, a soprano (though\r\nit can well be sung by a mezzo), and Adriano, son of a patrician, a\r\nmezzo-soprano (almost a contralto part)--which would be amazing did we\r\nnot know Wagner's aim. A woman-man carries us back to the days of\r\nHandel and Gluck, and shows how little sincere Wagner was at the time,\r\nhow absorbingly bent he was on tickling the ears of the Parisians. The\r\nvillains of the piece, Colonna and Orsini, with their patrician\r\nfollowers, are true stage-villains of melodrama in some\r\nsituations--proud, determined, unsparing; but in other situations they\r\nwhine in a very un-patrician-like way for mercy. In truth, Wagner was\r\ndetermined to give all the singers a chance of showing off their\r\nvoices and their skill in every kind of music--heroic or noisy,\r\npathetic or whining, brave and obstreperous or feebly tender. A few\r\nminutes' consideration of the story as Wagner lays it before us, and\r\nthe music he sets to it, will show that every character in the opera\r\nis an unhuman chameleon. It is not worth while spending the reader's\r\ntime on an exhaustive analysis. We shall have enough to do of that\r\nkind of thing when we come to the beginning of Wagner's riper work,\r\nthe _Dutchman_: time and space would only be wasted if we examined\r\n_Rienzi_ very closely.\r\n\r\nThe curtain rises on a street in Rome; it is night, and in the\r\nforeground Rienzi's house can be discerned. Orsini and his companions\r\nrun up a ladder to a window, enter, and come out carrying Irene,\r\nRienzi's sister. She screams for help quite in the Donna Anna manner;\r\nColonna and his companions come in and fall to blows--why, is not too\r\nclear--with Orsini and his men. Adriano, Colonna's son, rescues Irene.\r\nCrowds of the common people rush in, wildly asking one another what\r\nthe row is about; Raimondo, the pope's legate, comes on, and in the\r\nname of holy mother church begs for peace; Rienzi, waked by this time,\r\nsees what has occurred, and in a speech--uttered mainly in the driest\r\nof dry recitative--taunts the patricians with their bad conduct and\r\ntheir reckless readiness to break all the vows they have made. The\r\nnobles announce their intention of going elsewhere to fight out their\r\nquarrel to the bitter end, and they go. Rienzi beseeches the crowd to\r\nwait their time, and he will lead them to destroy their oppressors.\r\nThey quietly disperse; Rienzi, Adriano and Irene have a scene; Rienzi\r\nrecognises in his sister's rescuer the son of his brother's murderer,\r\nAdriano, and the latter, who has fallen in love with Irene, promises\r\nto take Rienzi's part, and the three sing a trio as cold, undramatic\r\nand commonplace as anything in Donizetti. There are two passages in it\r\nwhich possess life: a variant of a theme from _Euryanthe_, and a theme\r\ndistinctly suggestive of the Wagner of _Tristan_. Then Rienzi goes\r\noff, ostensibly to prepare for battle, but in reality to leave the\r\nscene clear for Adriano and Irene to sing a rather maudlin love-duet.\r\nA trumpet-call is heard; people rush in from all sides; Rienzi\r\naddresses them; and after choruses, partly double-choruses, all go off\r\nto fight the patricians. There is plenty of bustle; there is\r\ntremendous vigour; and the scene affords chances for the stage manager\r\nto manipulate big crowds effectively. But we must remember that the\r\nthing had been quite as well done by Auber in _Masaniello_: even the\r\nenergy is not the true Wagnerian energy divine: it does not show\r\nitself through the stuff of the music, but in the common rumty-tumpty\r\nrhythms of the day, often offensively vulgar, and in the noisy\r\ninstrumentation. Any one can write for a big chorus and orchestra,\r\nwith plenty of trumpets and drums: to fill the music itself with\r\nenergy is a task that Wagner could not cope with as yet.\r\n\r\nSo far the characters have been consistent. In the second act they all\r\nshow signs of weakness. Messengers of peace enter: Rienzi has\r\nconquered and freed the people from an unbearable yoke; he is\r\ncongratulated by the messengers who have wandered through the\r\ncountry--a pilgrimage that in the fourteenth century might well have\r\noccupied them for years--and everywhere peace prevails. The music here\r\nhas a certain charm and freshness, but no more can be said for it.\r\nWagner wanted a contrast to the imposing displays of the first act, so\r\nhe simply put in this unnecessary scene. The patricians enter and\r\nwhine, begging for mercy; Rienzi, now Tribune, joins the senators; and\r\nColonna, Orsini and the rest begin to plot his death. Adriano, amongst\r\nthem unnoticed at first, expostulates--begs them not to stain their\r\nhands and souls with the blood of the vanquisher who has treated them\r\nso magnanimously. They scorn him as a deserter of his own class; they\r\nleave, and he swears to save \"Irenens Bruder.\" He has become\r\nsentimentalist; but some of the music of the scene has strength. Then\r\nthe people conveniently flock in; ambassadors come from all corners of\r\nthe earth to acknowledge Rienzi; Adriano warns him that mischief is\r\nbreeding, and Rienzi calmly smiles; there is a most elaborate ballet,\r\noccupying many pages of the score and full of trumpery tunes; Orsini\r\nstabs Rienzi, and all the patricians are seized by the guards; Rienzi\r\nshows himself unhurt, being protected by a breastplate; the\r\nconspirators are condemned to die and are led away. Then Adriano and\r\nIrene plead for Colonna; at first Rienzi is obdurate; then he, too,\r\nturns weakling and promises pardon. He pleads for his enemies with the\r\npeople; in spite of two citizens who see nothing but danger, he\r\nprevails, and the act ends with another huge chorus. There is much\r\nvery Italian stuff in the music; but on the whole this scene is the\r\nstrongest in the opera. Of the real Wagner there is still small sign.\r\n\r\nHe had completed these two acts when he set out for Paris. Once he\r\nrealized how poor were the prospects of getting his work played there,\r\nhis ardour for bigness and noise seems to have cooled. There are no\r\nmore double choruses; everything is planned on a smaller scale. The\r\nthree remaining acts in their present form (for he afterwards\r\nshortened the opera) can be, and often are, compressed into two, or\r\neven one. They can be described in a few words. The people begin to\r\ndistrust Rienzi; the patricians recommence plotting; Rienzi leads the\r\npeople to victory against them, and Colonna, with the others, is\r\nkilled. Adriano again wobbles and swears vengeance; the capitol is set\r\non fire with Rienzi and Irene inside; at the last moment Adriano\r\nrepents and rushes in to die with them; the building falls with a\r\ncrash, destroying the three; and as the curtain falls the\r\npatricians--such as are left--seeing the people leaderless, fall upon\r\nand scatter them. There are pages on pages that one can scarcely\r\nbelieve came from Wagner's pen; in terrific theatrical situations the\r\nmost trivial Italian tunes are poured out in copious profusion. The\r\nwar hymn is sheer rowdyism; the great broad melody which forms part of\r\nthe prayer, and on which the introduction of the overture is based,\r\nstands out from a weltering sea of orchestral bangs, noises and\r\nscreams and skirls of the strings. But there are numberless chances\r\nfor fine voices to be heard; and at that time of day these were even\r\nmore prized than they are to-day. The sparkle, the fireworks, the\r\nsheer noise of the choruses, carried every one away. In Dresden Wagner\r\nbecame the man of the hour. He had aimed at a success of this sort,\r\nand he attained it, though by no means so quickly as he had expected,\r\nnor in the quarter where a success would have been profitable.\r\n\r\nIt is not needful to say much more about the music. It shows a variety\r\nof influences; it shows also that Wagner, before he was thirty, was,\r\nas I have already said, a perfect master of the tricks of the trade.\r\nIn huge imposing effects he out-Meyerbeered Meyerbeer, out-Spontinied\r\nSpontini. If his tunes have not the superficial gracefulness of\r\nBellini it is because Wagner, in spite of himself, was driven by his\r\ndæmon to aim at expressiveness, and, as in the _Dutchman_ a very short\r\ntime afterwards, fell between two stools. His tunes lack the fluency\r\nof the Italians because he did, in a half-hearted way, want to utter\r\ngenuine feeling; they are not finely, accurately and logically\r\nexpressive as they are in _Tannhäuser_ and _Lohengrin_, because the\r\nItalian influence, and the necessity of writing to please the gallery,\r\nperpetually held him back. The contours of the melodies are dictated\r\nfrom outside, consciously copied from alien models: in the later works\r\nthey are shaped by the inner force of his own mind, and though the\r\nWeber idiom is prevalent, he used it unconsciously, as children in\r\nlearning to speak acquire the accent of the elders about them or the\r\ndialect of the neighbourhood in which they are reared. I say the tunes\r\nlack external grace, and I might go further: all the themes, all the\r\npassages that follow (rather than grow out of) the themes, are\r\ncharacterized by a certain clumsiness. This followed, as night the\r\nday, from the attempt to copy and to be original at the same time. He\r\ncould not obey his instinct and write directly and simply: he must\r\nneeds warp and twist the obvious, and disguise, even from himself, its\r\nessential commonplaceness. A remarkable instance is his use of the\r\nDresden Amen in _Rienzi_ as compared with his use of it in\r\n_Tannhäuser_. In the latter it is plain, diatonic and immensely--in\r\nthe best sense--effective; in _Rienzi_, in spite of the vigour of its\r\npresentation, the effect is weakened by the way in which it is bent\r\naway to a chromatic something which is neither frankly Italian nor\r\nhonestly German. Again, he composed with an audience in his mind's eye\r\nthat could only take in one melody or theme at a time. The melody\r\nmight be in an upper part, a middle, or in the bass. In one or another\r\nit always is, and the rest of the musical tissue is only\r\naccompaniment. Hence a heaviness, a lumbering motion of the harmonies,\r\nwhich is irritating to our ears now that we are accustomed to webs he\r\nspun in later days when music no longer consisted to him of top parts\r\nand bottom parts, but of a broad stream of parts, all of equal\r\nimportance, and all flowing along together, preserving each its\r\nindividuality, and each individual blending with the others to produce\r\nthe total effect. In _Rienzi_ the bass often remains the same for bars\r\ntogether, while in an upper part a florid tune flourishes its tail, so\r\nto speak, for the public amusement. An ugly trick he indulged in at\r\nthis time was giving to the voice the notes of the instrumental\r\nbass--a remnant of the eighteenth-century way of writing for the bass\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nArtistically _Rienzi_ was a sin. Remembering that _Die Feen_ had been\r\nwritten years before, it is useless to contend that Wagner did not\r\nknow he was aiming at something lower than the best he could produce.\r\nHe never again fell away from his highest and truest self, though he\r\nwas sorely tempted.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe simple, terrible old legend of the Flying Dutchman had in it no\r\nelements of drama. The irascible mariner of ancient times, vainly\r\nstruggling to round Cape Horn (or some other cape) against a head\r\nwind, swore in his wrath that he would succeed if he tried until the\r\nDay of Judgment; a lightning flash in the sky proclaimed that he was\r\ntaken at his word; thenceforward his ship sailed the seas without\r\nstopping; it never could reach any port, and release would only come\r\nat the last day. The crew died and their ghosts worked the vessel; the\r\nvessel rotted and the ghostly crew continued to work a phantom ship;\r\nonly Vanderdecken, the skipper, seems to have lived on in the flesh.\r\nOther ships passed through the phantom as though it was a cloud; and\r\nthe living crews shuddered, and cursed the dead. Before this thing of\r\nterror and mystery could form a part of any drama, adventures had to\r\nbe invented and grafted on to it. As with the legend of the Wandering\r\nJew, this was done in a hundred, perhaps a thousand, instances; and\r\nnever had a good piece of work been the result. Whether Heine did or\r\ndid not himself devise the form in which the legend is used in his\r\nreminiscences of Herr von Schnabalewopski it is not worth troubling to\r\nfind out. It is enough that in Heine, Wagner found the story more or\r\nless as he employed it. It is an odd compound--odd at this time of day\r\nat least--of the hard old superstition with soft German sentimentality\r\nof the Romantic period. A good Angel, thinking the Dutchman's fate\r\ntoo hard, interceded for him; and though his sentence could not be\r\nwholly remitted, a bargain was struck. Once in seven years\r\nVanderdecken could land and spend a certain time ashore. If during\r\nthis interval of peace he could find a maiden who would love him\r\nfaithfully to death, he would be released: his wanderings would be\r\no'er, and death would swallow him up. How the maiden's fidelity could\r\nbe tested does not appear.\r\n\r\nWagner would have it that with the _Dutchman_ he ceased to be a mere\r\nstringer of opera verses and became the full poet. The work does not\r\nsupport that view; nor is the construction of the plot one whit better\r\nthan a hundred others put together by hacks before he was born. Each\r\nact is crammed with conventional tricks out of the hack's common\r\nstock; in each scene, from the very first, characters come on or go\r\noff, not because it is inherent in the action that they should do so,\r\nbut because without such helps the librettist, or \"poet,\" could not\r\nhave got along. The curtain rises on a rocky Norwegian fiord where a\r\nsailing-vessel has found shelter from a storm that is raging on the\r\nopen sea. Daland, the skipper, has gone ashore to survey the land and\r\nto find out, if he can, whither his ship has been driven. He\r\nrecognizes the spot: it is Sandwike, and the tempest has blown him\r\n\"sieben Meilen\" out of his course. However, he is glad enough to be\r\nsafe; and seeing signs of better weather goes into his cabin to wait,\r\nleaving a watchman on guard. This is the first specimen of the old\r\nstage-craft; Daland had to be got rid of, so, instead of attending to\r\nany damage the waves may have caused the ship, he goes quietly\r\ndownstairs to take a snooze. The watchman tries to keep himself awake\r\nby singing. But it is no use. The librettist is inexorable: the stage\r\nis wanted for some one else; and the watchman's song merely acts as a\r\nsoporific, and at last the poor fellow snores. In the distance appears\r\nthe ship of the Flying Dutchman--\"blutroth die Segel, schwarz der\r\nMast\"--she nears rapidly, enters the fiord and casts anchor hard by\r\nDaland's boat, and Vanderdecken comes ashore. It is the seventh year,\r\nand he has the usual short respite in which to seek the maid who will\r\nredeem him. He has a long soliloquy; then, in the nick of time, Daland\r\nawakes, comes on deck, unjustly reproaches the watchman for dozing,\r\nhails the Dutchman, and joins him on the rocks for a chat. They soon\r\ngrow friendly and strike a bargain. Daland is to take the stranger\r\nhome with him, and if his daughter Senta proves satisfactory,\r\nVanderdecken is to have her as his bride in return for infinite\r\ntreasure out of the hold of the strange vessel. Daland has been shown\r\na sample, and is overjoyed with his bargain: a distinguished-looking\r\nhusband for his daughter and the husband's wealth for himself. The\r\nwind changes to a favourable one; Daland sets out first, leaving the\r\nDutchman to follow in a boat which we may well believe goes faster,\r\nfor it is driven by the devil and carries a private hurricane wherever\r\nit goes. The convenient veering of the wind need not be taken as\r\nforced on the stage manager by the librettist, for Daland foretells\r\nit at the very beginning of the act.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to treat so noble a work as the _Flying Dutchman_ with\r\nany irreverence; but if it is worth understanding Wagner's art, and\r\nthe slow processes of its transition from the baldness and\r\nultra-conventionality of _Rienzi_ to the richness and simplicity and\r\ndirectness of _Tristan_, we must realize clearly that in its present\r\nstage the craftsmanship was little in advance of Scribe's. In some\r\nrespects he was very far in advance of Scribe. The whole thing springs\r\nfrom and swings round a central idea, the idea of the lonely outcast\r\ndoomed to sail a stormy sea for ever without even the prospect of hell\r\nas a refuge, always seeking one to redeem him and free him from his\r\ntorments, and at last finding her. But Wagner had not yet evolved or\r\ninvented the technique which would enable him to present his idea in\r\nthe theatre without resorting to those crude conventionalities which\r\nseemed harmless and even reasonable enough at the time, though now\r\nthey compel us to smile. He could no more have constructed the\r\nframework of the _Dutchman_ without shoving on and pulling off his\r\npuppets as seemed desirable than he could have written the music\r\nwithout using the set forms, airs, duets, etc., of a type of opera\r\nwhich, in intention, he had already gone far beyond. The\r\nconventionality shows itself in one rather surprising way. Throughout\r\nthe opera it is made plain that the whole world knows the Dutchman\r\nstory: mariners shiver when they think of meeting him; children are\r\nscared when they are told of him. Yet when the very ship described in\r\nthe \"old ballad,\" sung in the second act, sails into the fiord with\r\nits blood-red sails and black masts, no one evinces the faintest\r\nastonishment. Daland has the Dutchman's picture at home; he sees the\r\nship before his eyes; but in a matter-of-fact manner he asks him who\r\nhe is. Daland's sailors are called on deck to set sail, and pay no\r\nattention to so weird a craft.\r\n\r\nIn the next act we have a room in Daland's house. A number of girls\r\nare spinning; Senta alone is idle, absorbed in a portrait that hangs\r\non the wall--that of Vanderdecken. From earliest girlhood she has\r\nheard his tale and brooded over it; and self-sacrifice being her\r\nhobby, she has evidently worked herself up into a morbid state of mind\r\nand resolved to \"redeem\" the unfortunate man should the opportunity\r\noccur. This is honest work, not Scribe make-believe. Cases in which\r\nmen and women have wrought themselves into an exalted mood and planned\r\nand achieved deeds, great or small, noble or ignoble, but always more\r\nor less mad, are common enough in history to justify a dramatist in\r\ntaking a specimen as one of the persons of his drama. Besides, Senta,\r\nfrom the moment she is seen, stands out as the principal figure. The\r\nDutchman is there to give character and atmosphere to the piece, but\r\ndramatically he is nothing more than Senta's opportunity personified.\r\nThe girls spin on; a kind of forewoman, Mary, upbraids Senta with\r\nidling and staring at the picture and dreaming away her life--for the\r\ngirl is quite open about her sympathy with the accursed seafaring\r\nman. She wants Mary to sing the _Flying Dutchman_ ballad; Mary curtly\r\nrefuses; \"Then,\" rejoins Senta, for all the world like a leading lady\r\nin a melodrama giving the cue for the band to begin the royalty-song,\r\n\"I'll sing it myself\"; and, despite protests, she does. It recounts,\r\nof course, the story of the Dutchman prior to his meeting with Daland.\r\nAt the end she announces her intention of saving him; and while the\r\nwomen are expostulating, Eric rushes in to add his voice to theirs. He\r\ntells them Daland's ship is in sight; and all save he and Senta scurry\r\noff to make preparations. Eric wishes to marry her, and pleads his\r\ncause; she asks him what his griefs are compared with those of the\r\ndoomed man whose picture hangs on the wall. He (rightly) thinks her\r\nsemi-demented, and tells a dream he had: of the Dutchman entering, of\r\nSenta at once giving herself to him, and then sailing away. His story\r\nhas a result precisely contrary to what he intended and hoped: her\r\necstasy becomes more violent than ever; he (the Dutchman) seeks her\r\nand she will share his grief with him. Eric rushes off in despair and\r\nhorror; Senta subsides; she prays that the Dutchman may be able to\r\nfind her--and her father and Vanderdecken enter.\r\n\r\nShe stands mazed, not greeting her father nor uttering a word, gazing\r\nat the stranger. Now Daland, I have already remarked, has noticed no\r\nresemblance between this man and the picture, and he cannot understand\r\nhis daughter's silence. Finally she salutes him and asks about\r\nVanderdecken; and Daland, in haste, discloses his plan. Neither\r\nVanderdecken nor Senta speaks; so, with a stroke of the old-fashioned\r\nopera trickery, Wagner makes Daland feel himself _de trop_ and go\r\naway. Vanderdecken at once begins his story, and the pair sing a duet,\r\nwhich I will deal with shortly; for the moment I need only remind the\r\nreader that Senta's mind was made up in advance. When the Dutchman,\r\nalmost warningly, reminds her that it is nothing less than a life's\r\ndevotion he demands, she proudly answers, \"Whoever you are, whatever\r\nthe curse on you, I will share your life and your doom.\" The\r\nlibrettist now having need of his services for the finale, Daland\r\nenters, and the act winds up with a showy trio.\r\n\r\nNo further comment is needed on this act: in structure, like the\r\nfirst, it is only old-fashioned opera. It is in the third act that the\r\ninherent weakness of the story for operatic purposes shows with almost\r\ndisastrous results. Only the sheer force of the music averts a\r\ncomplete breakdown. The problem was to show Senta literally faithful\r\nunto death. Evidently it was impossible for Vanderdecken to claim and\r\ncarry off his bride forthwith. Had that been possible the work might\r\nhave terminated with a short scene to form the real finale of the\r\nsecond act. But Vanderdecken had asked for a wife, and Daland would\r\nnot have dreamed of letting his daughter go until the proper ceremony\r\nhad taken place. Besides, Wagner was writing an opera with the very\r\npractical view of a performance in the theatre; and in those days of\r\nlengthy operas (_Rienzi_ at first played five and a half hours) the\r\npublic would have grumbled if they did not get enough for their\r\nmoney. No manager would have looked at a work no longer than the first\r\nand second acts of the _Dutchman_. The final scene could not be made\r\nvery lengthy; so the composer determined to pad out the act with pure\r\nirrelevant music, and the librettist had to find him words. In a piano\r\nscore now before me the essential part of the act, the scene in which\r\nSenta redeems the Dutchman, occupies twenty-four pages; and these are\r\npreceded by fifty pages of choruses of sailors, maidens and ghosts.\r\nAllowing for the larger space occupied by choruses on the printed\r\npage, we are half-way through the act before serious business begins.\r\nIt must be owned that Wagner has done his work superbly, even making\r\nuse of it to a certain extent. Girls bring provisions and drinks for\r\nDaland's crew, and there is a lot of chorus and counter-chorus and\r\ndancing. Then both men and girls call upon the Dutch crew. There is no\r\nresponse. The ship lies wrapt in gloom; and, half afraid, the girls\r\nand Daland's men taunt them with being dead. But suddenly the hour\r\narrives for the Dutchman to sail. With perfect calm all around, a\r\nhurricane shakes her sails and shrieks and pipes in the rigging, and\r\nthe waters roar and foam; the crew come to life and call for their\r\ncaptain in a series of unearthly choruses. Daland's men,\r\nhorror-struck, make the sign of the cross; the spectres give a\r\n\"taunting laugh\" and subside; once again all is peace, and the\r\nsinister vessel lies there, the air seeming to thicken and grow\r\nblacker about her.\r\n\r\nThe women have gone off; the sailors occupy themselves with eating\r\nand drinking; and Senta, pursued by Eric, comes on. He has heard of\r\nthe intended marriage, and begs passionately that she shall not\r\nsacrifice herself, ending with a cavatina--a cavatina by Richard\r\nWagner!--in vain. But Vanderdecken has heard all from the\r\nwings--another bit of old-fashioned stage trickery, like the\r\n\"asides\"--and resolves that Senta shall not sacrifice herself. \"For\r\never lost,\" he cries, realizing that he is renouncing his last chance.\r\nSenta declares her determination to follow him--she will redeem him\r\nwhether he wishes it or not; in a regular set trio she, he and Eric\r\nthrash the matter out; she is not to be shaken; Eric gives a\r\ndespairing cry which brings on the women folk and the sailors. The\r\nDutchman says farewell, pipes up his spectral crew, who heave the\r\nanchor, and he goes on board. As the ship moves off Senta throws\r\nherself into the water; the ship falls to pieces; the sun rises, and\r\nin its beams the \"glorified forms\" of the pair are seen mounting the\r\nskies. Senta has had her way: she has worked out her destiny and\r\n\"saved\" the wanderer. The curtain falls.\r\n\r\nThis is the first of the genuine Wagner dramas, the first, therefore,\r\nfrom which the Wagnerians have drawn, or into which they have read,\r\n\"lessons.\" As we get on I shall try to show that no moral can be\r\ntacked on to any of Wagner's works. But supposing that he did wish to\r\nteach us something in the _Dutchman_, what on earth can it be? Not,\r\nsurely, that one should not swear rash oaths in a temper? We have all\r\ndone that and needed no redeemer. There is no touch of essential\r\nveracity in the old legend, a bit of puerile medieval fantasy; there\r\nis no sort of proportion between the trivial offence and the appalling\r\npunishment; even in an age which thought to oppose the will of the\r\nAlmighty the rankest blasphemy it can never have been considered\r\neternally just that a righteous and merciful Creator should deal out\r\nsuch a punishment. Besides, in the ancient legend, as in Wagner's\r\nbook, the Almighty has little to do with the matter: it is the foul\r\nfiend who snaps up Vanderdecken in his momentary lapse. Again, after\r\nthe first act Vanderdecken is second to Senta. Even the belated\r\nattempt to show him heroic in his determination to sail off alone to\r\nhis doom has no dramatic point; it has no bearing on his salvation,\r\nfor nothing happens until Senta jumps into the sea, and we feel sure\r\nnothing would have happened if she had not jumped. _That_ lesson, at\r\nany rate--a childish, inept, inane, insane one at best--is not set\r\nforth in the _Dutchman_. The only other possible one is that\r\nself-sacrifice is a worthy and beautiful thing in itself. In itself, I\r\nsay, for Senta's self-sacrifice is purely a fad: she knows nothing of\r\nVanderdecken save a rumour shaped into a primitive ballad. Such\r\nself-sacrifice is not worthy, not beautiful; but, on the contrary, a\r\nvery ugly and detestable form of lunacy. In truth, not only is there\r\nno lesson in the _Dutchman_, but the whole idea is so absurd that only\r\nthe power of the music enables us to swallow it at all. The condition\r\non which the Dutchman can be saved is purely arbitrary; what\r\ndifference ought it to make to him that some one, for the sake of an\r\nidea, sacrifices herself? The \"good angel\" who proposed it must have\r\nbeen temporarily out of her senses, and the Creator when he agreed\r\nmust have been nodding. And the whole business is smeared over with\r\nGerman mawkish sentimentality--this business, I mean, of Senta\r\n_loving_ the Dutchman. Had he seen and loved her, and resolutely\r\nsailed off without her, and found his salvation in that, there would\r\nbe some semblance of reason; but the fumbling attempt to make\r\nsomething of the man at the last moment is futile, and we are left\r\nwith nothing but sentimental sickliness, nauseating and revolting. In\r\na word, then, we must take the _Dutchman_ libretto as it is,\r\nunreasonable, false: only a series of occasions for writing some fine\r\nmusic. That it is nothing more than such a series I have endeavoured\r\nto establish at all this length; because if it is worth understanding\r\nWagner at all, and if we wish to understand him, we must realise the\r\npoint he started from in his half-conscious groping after the opera\r\nform which he only found in its full perfection in his _Tristan_\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIn the music the head and shoulders of the real Wagner emerge boldly\r\nfrom the ruck of commonplace which constitutes the bulk of the\r\noperatic music of the time. How any one could have failed to see the\r\nstrength and beauty of much of the _Dutchman_ is one of those things\r\nalmost impossible to understand to-day. Of the tawdry vulgarity, the\r\nblatant clamour, of _Rienzi_ there is not a hint. The opera is by no\r\nmeans all on the highest level, but a good third of it is, and there\r\nare pages which Richard never afterwards surpassed. A dozen passages\r\nare prophetic of the Wagner of _Tristan_ and the _Ring_. Let me begin\r\nby quoting a few of these. The phrase (_a_, page 118) immediately\r\nsuggests _Tristan_, as it screams higher and higher with\r\never-increasing intensity of passion; a variant of it (_b_) is charged\r\nwith the same feeling, and is used in the same way. The feeling is not\r\nthe same as in _Tristan_; both are used when Eric makes his last\r\ndespairing appeals to Senta. But look at (_c_). Compare it with one of\r\nthe themes (_d_) expressive of Wotan's anguish, and then recollect\r\nthat (_c_) is used when Vanderdecken, in veiled speech, tells Daland\r\nof his woes. When Vanderdecken is yearning for Senta's love, and\r\ntrembling lest by telling the truth he should frighten her, we get\r\n(_e_), afterwards developed with such poignant effect in the first and\r\nlast acts of _Tristan_. Vanderdecken enters with Daland, and Senta,\r\nalmost stunned, sets eyes on him for the first time. The musical\r\nphrase is (_f_), which, simplified and more direct in its appeal, was\r\nto be used when Siegmund and Sieglinda first gaze on one another. Then\r\nthe passage (_g_) is one which the reader will find mentioned in my\r\nchapter on _Tristan_ (p. 263) as standing for quite a multitude of\r\nthings in the _Ring_. A curious case is the little phrase (_h_) which\r\noccurs in the middle of the watchman's song. Of no significance here,\r\nof what tremendous import it is in the first act of _Tristan_.\r\n\r\nNone of these phrases or passages is developed with the power and\r\nresource characteristic of Wagner's later work; but it is astonishing\r\nthat after the baldness and noise of _Rienzi_ he should have gone\r\nstraight on to invent such music at all. He was still groping his way,\r\nand had to trust to the conventional framework of opera construction\r\nto a large extent; that is, each act is divided into set numbers, even\r\nwhen the numbers are based on music which has been heard before and to\r\nwhich, therefore, a definite meaning has become attached. He could not\r\nyet trust himself in an open sea of music, as he did in _Tristan_;\r\nrather, we have a chain of lakes, the music sometimes overflowing out\r\nof one into another. The marvellous continual development of themes\r\nwith intricate interweavings and incessant transmogrifications--all\r\nthis was part of the technique of the _Tristan_ period. Neither in the\r\n_Dutchman_ nor in _Tannhäuser_ nor in _Lohengrin_ is there any sign of\r\nit. Of what may be called leitmotivs there are only three, the\r\nDutchman (_i_) and Senta (_j_), while a portion of the second (_k_)\r\nmay be regarded as a third, for it is used by itself, independently.\r\nOne little group of notes (_l_) I have seen described as a leitmotiv;\r\nand if it is one, I should like to know what it stands for. As can be\r\nseen, it is a bit of the Senta theme (fourth bar of _j_); and in the\r\noverture a long connecting passage is built on it. But it also forms\r\npart of the chorus of sailors in the first act, part of the watchman's\r\nsong in a varied form, part of another sailors' chorus (_m_); it is\r\nthe very backbone of the spinning chorus; and lastly, a large portion\r\nof the spectral sailors' chorus is made up of it. I have no\r\nexplanation to offer--unless it be that Wagner, bent on suggesting the\r\nsea throughout the opera, felt that this phrase helped him to sustain\r\nthe atmosphere. The sea, indeed, throughout the _Dutchman_, is the\r\nbackground, foreground, the whole environment of the drama; in this\r\nwild legend which came out of the sea, every action is related to the\r\nsea, and one might say that the sea's voice is echoed in every one's\r\nspeech. The sea music, therefore, based on Senta's ballad--apart from\r\nthe leitmotivs which that contains--is of the very first importance.\r\nThe easiest way to get a firm grasp of the _Dutchman_ is to analyse\r\nthis ballad. Then in passing rapidly over the score afterwards we\r\nshall see at a glance the structure of the whole, and how the new\r\nthematic matter is either welded into this sea music or stodgily\r\ninterpolated. The song is too long to be transcribed here; but every\r\nreader must have in his possession a copy at this time of day. There\r\nare ten bars of introduction: in the eleventh, to the Dutchman theme,\r\nSenta sings the \"Yo-ho-ho\"; at the fifteenth, with a glorious swing\r\nand rush she dashes into the ballad--\r\n\r\n    \"Traft ihr das Schiff im Meere an,\r\n    Blutroth die Segel, schwarz der Mast?\r\n    Auf hohem Bord der bleiche Mann,\r\n    Des Schilfes Herr, wacht ohne Rast.\"\r\n\r\nThis consists of eight bars--a four-bar section repeated. Then we get\r\nthe storm music, four bars of which I quote (_n_), and this is freely\r\nemployed throughout the opera. The storm subsides, and at bar\r\nthirty-nine Senta sings to her own theme--\r\n\r\n    \"Doch kann dem bleichen Manne Erlösung einstens noch werden,\r\n    Fänd' er ein Weib, das bis in den Tod getreu ihm auf Erden.\"\r\n\r\nleading into the second part (_k_) to the words--\r\n\r\n    \"Ach! Wann wirst du, bleicher Seemann, sie finden?\r\n       Betet zum Himmel dass bald\r\n       Ein Weib Treue ihm halt'!\"\r\n\r\nThe three themes are of very unequal power. The first is one of the\r\nlandmarks in musical history; neither Wagner himself nor any of the\r\nother great masters ever hit upon a more gigantic theme, terrible in\r\nits direct force at its announcement, still more terrible as it is\r\nused in the overture and later in the drama. The second, Senta, is a\r\npiece of sloppy German sentimentality: this is not a heroine who will\r\n(rightly or wrongly) sacrifice herself for an idea, but a hausfrau who\r\nwill always have her husband's supper ready and his slippers laid to\r\nwarm on the stove shelf. It is significant that Senta herself in her\r\nmoment of highest exaltation does not refer to it: Wagner often\r\ncalculated wrong, but he never felt wrong. The third, the grief and\r\nanguish of the condemned sailor, and pity for him, is one of the most\r\nwonderful things in music; for blent with its pathos is the feeling of\r\na remoter time, the feeling that it all happened in ages that are\r\npast, the feeling for \"old, unhappy, far-off things, and battles long\r\nago.\" This sense of the past, the historic sense--call it what you\r\nwill--was thus strong in Wagner at this early period, and it grew even\r\nstronger later on, finding its most passionate expression in _Tristan_\r\nand its loveliest expression in the _Mastersingers_. The faculty to\r\nshape pregnant musical themes is the stamp of the great master. The\r\nearly men are supposed to have \"taken church melodies\" and worked them\r\nup into masses: what they did was to take meaningless strings of\r\nnotes, bare suggestions, and give them form and meaning by means of\r\nrhythm (for only boobies talk of the old church music not possessing\r\nrhythm). The later composers sometimes followed the same\r\nprocedure--which is equivalent to a sculptor \"taking\" a block of\r\nmarble and hewing out a statue; but more and more they trusted to\r\ntheir own imaginations. In either case the \"mighty line\" results; and\r\nthere is not a great composition in the world which has not great\r\nthemes; and, _vice versa_, when the themes are trivial the work\r\nevolved from them is invariably trivial. I see modern works full of\r\ncleverness and colour: I do not waste much time on them; there cannot\r\nbe anything in them, and they will not survive. Along with some weak\r\nmotives--or, to be more accurate, motives which are musically weak but\r\ndramatically a help--Wagner has a huge list of tremendous ones, each a\r\nlandmark. However, this by way of digression.\r\n\r\nMusic evolved from this ballad forms, as I have said, the structural\r\noutline of the opera. The overture is almost entirely shaped out of\r\nit, being one of that sort which is supposed to foreshadow the opera,\r\nto tell the tale in music before we see it enacted on the stage. From\r\nthe _Dutchman_ onward Wagner nearly always constructed his\r\nintroductions--whether to whole operas or to single acts or even\r\nscenes--on this plan, largely discarding the purely architectural\r\nforms. Here, for example, we have at the outset the blind fury of the\r\ntempest, taken and developed from (_n_), with the Dutchman theme. The\r\nstorm reaches its height, and there is a brief lull, and Vanderdecken\r\nseems to dream of a possible redeemer; the elements immediately rage\r\nagain, with the wind screaming fiercely through sails and ropes, and\r\nwaves crashing against the ship's sides; he yearns for rest (_k_),\r\nseems to implore the Almighty to send the Day of Judgment; and at\r\nlength the Senta motive enters triumphantly, and with the redemption\r\nof the wanderer the thing ends. That, one can see, is the chain of\r\nincidents Wagner has translated into tones, or illustrated with tones;\r\nbut as a prelude to the opera, it is the atmosphere of the sea that\r\ncounts: the roar of the billows, the \"_hui!_\" of the wind, the dashing\r\nand plunging. When the curtain rises the storm goes on while Daland's\r\nmen, with their hoarse \"Yo-ho-ho,\" add even more colour. The motion of\r\nthe sea is kept up, partly with fresh musical material, until at last\r\nit all but ceases; the watchman sings his song of the soft south wind\r\nand falls asleep. Then the sky darkens, the Flying Dutchman comes in,\r\nand the storm music rages once more. It is woven into Vanderdecken's\r\nmagnificent scena (surely the greatest opera scena written up to\r\nthe year 1842); and then disappears. In its place we get pages of\r\n(for Wagner) wearisome twaddle. The reason is obvious. For the purpose\r\nof explaining the subsequent movement of the drama there is a lot of\r\nconversation which Weber, in the Singspiel, would have left to be\r\nspoken, and Mozart would have set to dry recitative. Wagner was\r\ndetermined that his music should flow on; but the inspiration of the\r\nsea was gone, and he could only fill up with uninspired stuff. He had\r\nnot yet mastered his new musico-dramatic art; indeed, I much doubt\r\nwhether he realized its possibilities. In his _Tristan_ days he knew\r\nhow to avoid explanations on the stage; nothing in _Tristan_ needs\r\nexplanation; in the _Mastersingers_ and the _Ring_ his resources--his\r\ninventiveness and technical mastery of music--were unbounded, and an\r\nintractable incident he simply smothered in splendid music. Here, the\r\nbargaining of Daland and Vanderdecken is a very intractable incident,\r\nand in trying to make the best of it he made the worst. That is, he\r\nwould have saved us an appalling _longueur_ had he given us two\r\nminutes of frank recitative in place of twenty minutes of make-believe\r\nmusic--music in the very finest kapellmeister style of the period.\r\nEven the passage quoted (_c_) is made nothing of. There are one or two\r\nfine dramatic touches, as, for instance, when Daland asks if his ship\r\nis any the worse: \"Mein Schiff ist fest, es leidet keinen Schaden,\"\r\nwith its bitter double meaning; but on the whole things are very\r\ndreary and dispiriting until the south wind blows up and stirs the\r\ncomposer's imagination. The sweet wind carries off the mariners to\r\ntheir home; the water ripples and plashes gently; and to the last bar\r\nof the act all is peace and beauty. The music has not, perhaps, the\r\npoint of, say, the quieter bits of Mendelssohn's _Hebrides_, but it\r\nruns delicately along, and it more than serves.\r\n\r\nThe figure (_l_), which has been so prominent in the overture and\r\nsailors' choruses, is equally noticeable in the next act. The spinning\r\nchorus, in fact, may be said to grow out of it. There is no break\r\nbetween the two acts (Wagner's first intention was to go straight on,\r\nmaking the _Dutchman_ an opera in one long act); the introduction to\r\nthe second is a continuation of the conclusion of the first. The\r\nfigure is repeated several times in a long diminuendo, changing the\r\nkey from B flat to A major, so we never cease to feel the presence of\r\nthe eternal sea. Inside the skipper's old-world house one is conscious\r\nthat the waves are plashing not far from the walls, and that the air\r\nis salt and fresh there. There is a pervading dreamy atmosphere: again\r\nwe are carried away into far-off times; the scene has the unreality of\r\na dream, a dream of the sea. Mlle. Senta quickly shatters that\r\nillusion with her passion and living young blood; but in memory one\r\nalways has this cottage, where women pass the days in singing, where\r\nthere are no clocks, and time can only be measured by the waves as\r\nthey break on the shore. The maiden's spinning song is small scale\r\nmusic; nothing ambitious is wanted, and nothing ambitious is\r\nattempted. As a bit of music it is infinitely superior to the clumsy\r\nwooden bridal chorus in _Lohengrin_; the touch is light, the melodies\r\nfresh and dainty, and the subdued hum of the wheels and the bustle are\r\nsuggested throughout without becoming monotonous. Not for a musical,\r\nbut for a purely theatrical, reason we get a snatch of (_k_); Senta is\r\nnot spinning; she is engaged in staring at the picture. After much\r\nchattering she sings the ballad, and at the end declaims her intention\r\nof saving the Dutchman to the music which is employed when she\r\nactually accomplishes that feat. When Eric rushes in, the orchestra\r\nhas the usual operatic storm-in-a-teacup sort of stuff; the chattering\r\nchorus of women getting ready for Daland's reception is neither here\r\nnor there; Eric's expostulations are insignificant, and the air he\r\nsings--with interruptions on the part of Senta--is by no means equal\r\nto the better parts of the opera. Here Wagner has again been faced by\r\nthe difficulty he met in the first act: a prosaic scene had to be set\r\nto poetic music, and the task was beyond him. Eric is one of the most\r\nfrightfully conventional personages in opera; he bores and exasperates\r\none to madness. He warbles away in the approved Italian tenor fashion\r\nwhile one's enthusiasm is growing cold and one's interest waning. His\r\ndream, however, in which he sees Senta meet the Dutchman, embrace him\r\nand sail away with him, has a genuine ring. The atmosphere is strange,\r\nalmost nightmareish, with the Dutchman theme sounding up at intervals,\r\ndreamlike. With the exception of the mere mention of this motive in\r\nthe score, the music is new, is not evolved out of previous passages;\r\nbut when Eric has finished we hear the Senta theme, both sections.\r\nThe Dutchman and Daland enter, and we hear (_f_) three times in all;\r\nbut there is no development of it. Daland's air is entirely fresh\r\nmatter; as is the opening of the big duet between the Dutchman and\r\nSenta.\r\n\r\nWe are now approaching the supreme moment of the drama. The Dutchman's\r\nrecitative-like beginning--declamation of the same type, and with the\r\nsame accent, as some recitative in the song-tournament in\r\n_Tannhäuser_--is noble in the highest degree; we have a recurrence of\r\nthe dream-atmosphere at Senta's words, \"Versank ich jetzt in\r\nwunderbares Träumen?\"--for though her fanaticism is all too real, when\r\nher opportunity comes she is for the moment incredulous. It hardly\r\ndoes to consider the moral aspect of the play at this juncture.\r\nVanderdecken is merely a greedy, selfish skipper who, having got into\r\nsome trouble, is anxious that a pure young maiden should throw away\r\nher life that he may be comfortable. Not any casuistry or splitting of\r\nhairs can alter the plain fact--\r\n\r\n    \"Wirst du des Vaters Wahl nicht schelten?\r\n    Was er versprach, wie?--dürft' es gelten?\"\r\n\r\nHowever, he has the honesty to warn her of her probable fate. She\r\nrises to the occasion. She may be as mad as a hatter, but in the music\r\nshe is given to \"Der du auch sei'st,\" her lunacy becomes sublimity. Up\r\nto the moment of writing this white-hot glowing passage Wagner had\r\nnever reached the sublime: now for a few minutes he sustains it.\r\nAgain the breath of the sea is brought in when the Dutchman a second\r\ntime warns her, and the sea music roars as a sinister accompaniment.\r\nSenta only becomes the more exalted. \"Wohl kenn' ich Weibes heil'ge\r\nPflichten,\" she sings to music which is absolutely the finest page in\r\nthe opera. The pure white flame of a deathless devotion is here. I\r\ndoubt whether Wagner ever again in his life had such an ethereal\r\nmoment: it is sheer fervour and sweetness, unmixed with the hot human\r\npassion of _Tristan_ or the smoky philosophies of the _Ring_. To wish\r\nSenta had a reasonable cause for her ecstasy of self-immolation is, of\r\ncourse, to wish the _Dutchman_ were not the _Dutchman_. In truth, we\r\nmust take the scenes as they come without inquiring too curiously; the\r\nstorm music which goes with the wanderer, and the moments of glorious\r\nsplendour that come to the redeeming woman, are things worth living to\r\nhave written and worth living to hear.\r\n\r\nThe music of the last act I shall pass quickly over. The seamen's and\r\nwomen's choruses are not particularly striking; the spectral choruses\r\ncertainly are. The sea music is here turned into something unearthly,\r\nfrightful; these damned souls have no hope of being saved, and in\r\ntheir misery they scoff and mock and laugh hideously. More new musical\r\nmatter, some of it of a very fine quality, is introduced when Eric\r\nagain appeals to Senta; and the figure (_a_) is developed with\r\nstupendous effect. In the final scene, when the Dutchman goes off,\r\nSenta can say nothing more after her declarations in the\r\nsecond--nothing, that is, of any musical value; and Wagner has wisely\r\nconfined her to recitative.\r\n\r\nThe _Flying Dutchman_, then, has many weaknesses. The libretto is a\r\nmanufacture, not, like _Tristan_, a growth. Much of the music does not\r\nrise above the level of Spontini or Marschner; there are wearisome\r\npages, there are heavy chords repeated again and again with violin\r\nfigurations on top, there are lines of the verse repeated to fit in\r\nwith the conventional melodies in four-bar lengths. It was only a few\r\nyears before that Wagner, at Riga, had written enthusiastically about\r\nBellini and his melody, a type of melody he felt to be fresh and\r\nexpressive compared with the dry-as-dust mixture of Viennese melody\r\n(_i.e._ the Haydn and Mozart type) and stodgy German counterpoint\r\nwhich formed the bulk of Marschner's and Spontini's music; and here we\r\nsee him in the very deed of trying his hand at it. Very often the\r\nresult, it must be admitted, is lamentable. There was no Italian\r\nsuppleness and grace in Wagner's nature: when he was in deadly\r\nearnest, and striving to express himself without thinking of models,\r\nhe wrote gorgeous stuff; when the inspiration waned, or when he\r\ndeluded himself with the belief that what he supposed to be\r\nBellini-like tunes really expressed the feeling of the moment, then he\r\ngave us pages as dry and dreary as Spontini and Marschner at their\r\nworst. Besides those I have already mentioned there are in the love\r\nduet--if it can be called a love duet--mere figurations over bar on\r\nbar on leaden-footed, heavy chords; and these figurations are not true\r\nmelody. These tunes in regular four-bar lengths are melody of an\r\namorphous sort; only when they were tightened up, made truer, more\r\npregnant--in a word, when they were so shaped as to stand really and\r\ntruly for the thought and feeling in the composer--did they become the\r\nbeautiful things we find in _Lohengrin_, foretelling the sublime\r\nthings we find in _Tristan_. Eric's tunes are as colourless as\r\nDonizetti's. All this we may joyfully admit, knowing how much there is\r\nto be said on the other side, and seeing in the _Dutchman_ only a\r\nforetaste of Wagner's greatest work. A really great work it assuredly\r\nis. We have the magnificent sea-music, and, in spite of outer\r\nincoherences, the smell and atmosphere of the sea maintained to the\r\nlast bar of the opera. In his music at least Vanderdecken is a deeply\r\ntragic figure. There is the ballad, by very far the finest in music;\r\nthere is Senta's declaration of faith. Whenever it was possible for\r\nthe composer to be inspired he instantly responded. Had he not lived\r\nto write another note his memory would live by the _Dutchman_. It is\r\nan enormous leap from _Rienzi_. There brilliancy is attained by huge\r\nchoruses and vigorous orchestration and rhythms that continually verge\r\non the vulgar. In the _Dutchman_ it is the stuff and texture of the\r\nmusic that make the effect. Play _Rienzi_ on a piano, and you have\r\nnothing; play the _Dutchman_, and you have immediately the roar of the\r\nsea, the Dutchman's loneliness and sadness, Senta's exaltation. I have\r\nspoken of Wagner having finished his apprenticeship when he went to\r\nMagdeburg, and in a sense he had; but perhaps in the fuller sense he\r\nfinished it only with the _Dutchman_. He made mistakes, and thanks\r\nlargely to them, so mastered his own personal art that he was prepared\r\nto take another and a vaster leap--from the _Dutchman_ to\r\n_Tannhäuser_. He cast the slough of the old Italian opera form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSome characteristics of his harmony and instrumentation will most\r\nconveniently be considered later. For the present I wish to draw my\r\nreader's attention rather to Wagner the musico-dramatist than to\r\nWagner the technical musician.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nDRESDEN\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nWhen Wagner left Paris on the proceeds of some work for Schlesinger\r\nwhich still remained to be done, he had learnt three lessons. The\r\nfirst, that it was foolish for an unknown man to go off into unknown\r\nlands, proved useful for a time. That is, for a time he put up with\r\nmany vexations rather than undertake such adventures. No one likes to\r\nbe starved and to see his wife starving, Wagner least of all men; and\r\nwe shall see that, once settled in Dresden, he set his teeth and\r\ngrinned and bore up against lack of appreciation and against actual\r\ninsult, so determined was he that his Minna should, if possible, live\r\nin comfort. This lesson had been emphasized by his experiences before\r\nhe received a permanent appointment. His creditors of the north,\r\nlearning of the success of _Rienzi_, and little dreaming his profits\r\nto be £45, immediately began to worry him; and until he got the\r\nconductorship of the Royal opera-house his plight was little, if any,\r\nbetter than it was in the Paris days. The second lesson was, that\r\nwhatever might happen in the future, it was futile to raise his eyes\r\nto Paris: Paris would not listen to him or to any sincere artist. The\r\nthird was that nothing was to be hoped at all from the modern opera.\r\nThat lesson he never forgot. Unfortunately its teaching clashed with\r\nthat of lesson number one, and for some time it was neglected. But\r\nDresden reinforced it as only a court-ridden town can, a town whose\r\ninhabitants were, almost to a man, the sort of flunkeys who hang\r\naround a Court.\r\n\r\nWagner did not wish to be kapellmeister--on the contrary, wished most\r\nvigorously not to be kapellmeister. What on earth he did wish to be,\r\nhow he hoped to earn bread--he who had had only one opera produced,\r\nand gained £45 by it: it is idle to speculate concerning such\r\nquestions. Excepting that he laboured incessantly at his\r\noperas--scheming and sketching, if not actually composing and\r\nwriting--he would seem at this stage of his growth to have been a Mr.\r\nMicawber, whose contemporary, of course, he was. He flirted with von\r\nLüttichau, the intendant of the theatre, a fine specimen of a court\r\nbarbarian. Wagner neither would nor wouldn't; and it was only when the\r\ntheatre found it could not well do without him, and asked him to say\r\ndefinitely if he would, that he accepted the offer. We can imagine how\r\npoor, stupid, unimaginative Minna would rejoice at the news. She ought\r\nto have married a pork butcher, or would have behaved admirably as the\r\nmistress of a beerhouse or café; but as the wife of a man of genius--!\r\nTo be the wife of the kapellmeister of one of Germany's principal\r\nopera-houses--a court opera-house--that was almost, if not quite, as\r\ngood; and for the time she rested content with her lot. And we may\r\nbelieve that Richard, too, felt a double gratification, even against\r\nhis deepest and truest instincts. The salary lifted a burden off his\r\nshoulders for a while; and was he not appointed to the very post his\r\nidol Weber had occupied? Nevertheless, things soon came to pass which\r\nshow how the Richard who set off from Pillau to Paris with his bare\r\ntravelling expenses, and the Richard who was to do yet madder things\r\nhereafter, was the Richard of this middle period. This von Lüttichau\r\nsaid it was the rule of the court that a new conductor should serve a\r\nyear on trial. Wagner was quite brutally reminded that the mighty\r\nWeber had been compelled to do so; and he was told _he_ must do so. He\r\npoint-blank refused; sent the Lüttichau man a long explanation--which,\r\nI dare say, was never read--of why he couldn't accept such terms;\r\nspoke of the necessity of getting some sort of order and discipline\r\ninto an orchestra which Reissiger had allowed to go to pieces, etc.,\r\netc. But he had to his credit, as we have seen, the triumphs of\r\n_Rienzi_ and the _Dutchman_; and it shows how much he was wanted that\r\nLüttichau yielded; he waived the twelve months' probation without\r\nmurmuring--a thing almost unheard of in the case of a German official,\r\na German court official. So on the 2nd of February, 1843, he was sworn\r\nin \"for life\" as co-conductor with Reissiger; and promptly learnt that\r\nhe had to wear a livery like others condemned to penal servitude for\r\nlife. This was the least of his troubles.\r\n\r\nReissiger had been the slackest of theatre conductors, the slackest\r\nof the slack old school. I may have mentioned that once I had the\r\nmisfortune to play the piano part in a number of his trios; and though\r\nthese are the only compositions of his known to me they suffice. A man\r\nwho had the patience to plod through the task of writing such dreary\r\nstuff and the presumption to send it forth to a world already familiar\r\nwith Mendelssohn's trios, if not with Beethoven's, cannot have had a\r\nspark of the genuine, enthusiastic musician in him. His waltz--known\r\nas \"Weber's last thoughts,\" in Germany and England as \"Weber's last\r\nwaltz\"--must have been the fruit of a lucky accident--or perhaps he\r\ndid have a moment of inspiration: it would be hard if that had not\r\ncome once in a lifetime to a man who wrote so much. The little thing\r\nis certainly pretty. But it is not enough to counteract the impression\r\nmade by his trios on me, nor by his operas and conducting-work on\r\nWagner. The latter, indeed, was fond of telling anecdotes showing how\r\nentirely indifferent Reissiger was to his work, so long as he got\r\nthrough it somehow, reached home in good time, and drew his pay\r\nregularly. One story, though well enough known, ought to be mentioned,\r\nbecause it reveals the man whose duties Wagner had to share, and the\r\nresult of whose faults Wagner had to cure and efface. Wagner met\r\nReissiger on the river bridge one evening at nine o'clock, when the\r\nopera ought to have been in full swing with Reissiger at the\r\nconductor's desk. \"Are you not conducting the opera to-night?\" asked\r\nWagner--possibly in a fit of consternation, thinking it might be\r\n_his_ night. \"Have had it,\" Reissiger replied; \"how's that for smart\r\nconducting?\" As long as they got through, Reissiger was content. Not\r\nso Wagner. His first duty was to make the band a smart, clean-playing,\r\nsmooth-working machine; the players had to learn to follow his beat\r\nand to obey his directions; and he at once met with opposition. The\r\nbandsmen, like Reissiger, and in fact all officials who regard their\r\nposts as more or less sinecures, wanted to go on in the old slovenly\r\nfashion, rehearsing carelessly, hastily, or not at all, and quite\r\nsatisfied so long as they got through. During the first weeks of the\r\nnew regime the principal first violin declined to follow Wagner's\r\ndirections, and, moreover, had the impudence to tell our arrogant\r\nRichard he was wrong, and, above all, to tell him in von Lüttichau's\r\npresence. Wagner, having the pen of a too-ready writer--like old\r\nSebastian Bach before him--sent in one of his long letters; and with\r\nthat the trouble ceased for the moment. But similar episodes seem to\r\nhave been of frequent occurrence during his six years of\r\nconductorship. Still, he introduced discipline into the band, and, on\r\nthe whole, got on well with his men. With genuine artists, even of the\r\nhumblest sort, he was always on good terms. He had a fine fund of good\r\nhumour and sanguine cheerfulness, a ready wit and a kind heart; he won\r\nthe respect due to a man who really knew his work, knew what he\r\nwanted, and how it could best be attained. What he wanted was\r\nperformances worthy of the house to which he had come as conductor.\r\nTricks were played on him, so that he had to direct operas which had\r\nbeen insufficiently rehearsed or not at all rehearsed; and the press\r\nmade the most of shortcomings which he realized better than the\r\ncritics.\r\n\r\nHe had compensations. August Roeckel became his assistant at the\r\ntheatre and a close personal friend; he had Heine, Fischer, Uhlig and\r\nothers amongst his intimates; and by what was undoubtedly the most\r\nartistic section of the community he was made much of. The Liedertafel\r\nchose him as its first Liedermeister. For the unveiling of a statue to\r\nFriedrich August I he organized a gigantic musical festival, writing\r\nfor the occasion a hymn. Mendelssohn had composed something for the\r\nevent; and the whole affair made the Dresden folk open their mouths as\r\nwell as their ears. For the Liedertafel he wrote the _Love-feast of\r\nthe Apostles_, which was performed on July 6 of this year (1843) with,\r\nso far as one can judge, immense effect and success. The pious\r\npress-men were, of course, scandalized by his very secular treatment\r\nof a sacred subject; they expected, or at least asked for, a\r\nMendelssohnian psalm--and they would have grumbled even had they got\r\nit. It was considered a crime to compete with Mendelssohn, also a\r\ncrime not to imitate him.\r\n\r\nAt this time he appears to have been happy with Minna; the good lady\r\nhad all she wanted; and the rift within the lute did not show until\r\nWagner later on began to kick against the pricks. Perhaps the greatest\r\npleasure that he had at this time--perhaps the greatest he had had in\r\nhis life--came through old Spohr the violinist, then conductor (and\r\nking) of the Cassel opera. Spohr had heard _Rienzi_ at Dresden, and,\r\nantiquated stick though he was--as any one might guess who knows his\r\n_Last Judgment_ or _Calvary_--he yet recognized in Wagner an original\r\nand deeply sincere musician. He wrote, after seeing the _Flying\r\nDutchman_, \"I believe I know my mind sufficiently to say that among\r\nthe dramatic composers of our day I consider Wagner the most gifted.\"\r\nHe produced the _Dutchman_ at Cassel, directing the representation\r\nhimself, and sent Wagner a letter which lifted that young man into the\r\nseventh heaven of delight. Wagner always cherished the recollection of\r\nthis, the first genuine praise he had received from an older musician,\r\nand one famous throughout Europe; and on Spohr's death, long\r\nafterwards, he wrote one of the most beautiful obituary articles in\r\nall literature. His answer to Spohr shows that at this time there were\r\nno serious differences in the household; he speaks in terms of the\r\ngreatest affection of his wife, and regrets that she is not there to\r\nshare his joy. The Cassel performance took place June 5, 1843. It was\r\nunsolicited: Spohr himself had asked for the score; and this had a\r\ndouble or triple value to Wagner. Spohr's authority was immense\r\nthroughout Germany; and the mere fact that he had asked for the\r\n_Dutchman_, and, later, performed it, was a recommendation to every\r\nother opera-house. And, as a matter of fact, it was done elsewhere,\r\nthough in many towns the thing was found incomprehensible, and the\r\nscore returned to Wagner unused, sometimes the parcel containing it\r\nunopened. By the way, Berlioz was in Dresden at the time, doing\r\nmountebank tricks with the orchestra, and after hearing, the\r\n_Dutchman_ he went so far as to speak well of it. Liszt was\r\nenthusiastic over _Rienzi_.\r\n\r\nWhen Spohr's letter arrived Minna was at Teplitz, ill; Wagner joined\r\nher there immediately his holiday began, but not before writing to\r\nLehrs (July 7) that the book of _Tannhäuser_ was finished. Whether\r\nLehrs received the letter I do not know, for he died on July 13. It\r\nwill be remembered that it was Lehrs who gave Wagner the _Sängerkrieg_\r\nfrom which he drew both _Tannhäuser_ and _Lohengrin_. Before dealing\r\nwith these operas, Wagner's first very great ones, we must pass in\r\nreview the remainder of the Dresden days, ending with the insurrection\r\nof May 1849 and the flight to Switzerland.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nNothing in Wagner's life has been less perfectly understood, or more\r\ncompletely and wilfully misunderstood, than his share in this May\r\ninsurrection of 1849. He was never at any time a politician; of\r\npolitics he knew nothing, and he held the trade in profound,\r\nundisguised contempt. He wrote much about the State, and in every\r\nparagraph contrived to show the astounding breadth of his\r\nignorance--an ignorance of that kind which Dr. Johnson might have\r\ndescribed as not natural but acquired. Everlastingly he prattles\r\nabout the State until he throws us into a condition of imbecile\r\nconfusion. Then we resolutely sit down to his prose writings and track\r\nhis meaning or meanings. And at last we perceive this: the State in\r\nhis mind, the State he talked and wrote about, was something purely\r\nideal, such a State as has never existed, and at the present day,\r\nnearly seventy years after Wagner's solitary plunge into practical\r\npolitics, seems as unlikely as ever to come into existence. He wanted\r\n(1) an all-wise absolute monarch who should work the will of all his\r\nsubjects, no matter how conflicting their interests might be; (2) some\r\nmillions of these subjects to think alike on every conceivable\r\nquestion--to think, that is, as Wagner thought; these millions to make\r\nsublime sacrifice of themselves that Wagner's art-schemes might\r\nprosper. All this, be it noted, was to be the barest basis and\r\nbeginning of the perfect State. How this point could be reached by our\r\nimperfect human race was a question he scorned to discuss: he simply\r\nassumed that it could be reached, and proceeded to further argument.\r\nThe point had to be attained in the first place; then humanity--by\r\nwhich he meant German humanity--was to move upward, working out the\r\nbeast, talking German philosophy, reading what is called German poetry\r\n(though Shakespeare might be tolerated), looking at what is called\r\nGerman painting, listening to German music, dreaming thin, mystical\r\nGerman dreams and munching thick German sausages. Thus should the\r\ninhabitants of a small subsidiary State, whose kings could be, and\r\nhad been, made and unmade by other kings, create for themselves a new\r\nheaven on earth and become the wonder of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is very like sheer lunacy. But this account is no exaggeration of\r\nWagner's doctrine and plans. The one truth which emerges and speaks\r\nunequivocally is that Richard, deeply dissatisfied with the theatre of\r\nthe day, and tracing its sad degeneracy to the corrupt state of\r\nsociety, wished to see society upraised, not that men and women might\r\nlive more happily, but that a finer, nobler theatre might flourish.\r\nThe most magnificent egotist of the century, it seemed to him the\r\nprime concern of mankind that Richard Wagner's works should be\r\nunderstood and loved. Being an egotist also, if I may say so, on a\r\nnational scale, he thought humanity could only be redeemed by German\r\nart. Disregarding the fact that Germany has had no painters, no poet\r\nof the first rank, no genuine dramatist, and that before \"our art,\" as\r\nhe persistently calls music, had got a root in Germany, three great\r\nschools had flourished, the English, the Flemish and the\r\nItalian--disregarding all this, he looked for the regeneration of the\r\nhuman species by means of the efforts of German artists alone. It is\r\ncomical, and, I say, very like lunacy. Mr. Ernest Newman will have it\r\nthat Wagner's was only a very mediocre intellect. The cold truth is\r\nthat only a mighty intellect, gone wrong on one point, could have\r\nevolved the idea of such a new social system. For, mark you, Wagner\r\npropounded no scheme for the regeneration of humanity: he assumed that\r\nit could regenerate itself by wishing, or willing, and that then the\r\nthousand years of peace would commence, with Richard as\r\nconductor-in-chief. He could not see that humanity cannot jump out of\r\nits shadow and regenerate itself, any more than gentlemen of\r\nintelligence gone wrong on one point can see that Bacon could not have\r\nwritten Shakespeare's plays, or that perpetual motion is a crazy\r\nimpossibility.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to picture the share Richard took in the Dresden ferment\r\nof 1848-49. Of course, all Europe was in a condition of excitement;\r\nand the powers that were got their guns ready, and their men.\r\nPolitical liberty was the thing aimed at: the \"outs\" wanted to be in.\r\nEvery right-thinking man must be in sympathy with the \"outs.\" The\r\ngovernments of Europe were in the hands of shameless place-seekers;\r\nthe working men, the merchants, all other classes were supposed to\r\nlabour and pay taxes for the benefit of these gentry. Money was\r\nsquandered on useless court-flummery while men were toiling sixteen\r\nhours a day for bread. The aristocracy were resolved that this state\r\nof affairs should continue; the average citizens were resolved that it\r\nshould not. What did Wagner propose?--obedience to the puppet king and\r\na reformed opera! It is small wonder that he was considered a\r\nvisionary. He made at least one speech, talking about the State,\r\nmeaning thereby something very different from the meaning his audience\r\nattached to the word; he heard speeches, and undoubtedly in all\r\nsincerity read his own thoughts into them. He thought the millennium\r\nwas at hand. When the fighting began he joined the revolutionists;\r\nthough I can nowhere find proof that he shouldered a musket. Had he\r\ndone so it is extremely probable he would have shot the man behind\r\nhim. It is hard to get at the truth about these days of May. Perhaps\r\nhe did help to escort supplies; but with his excitable brain we must\r\nremember that what he thought he saw and what he actually did see may\r\nbe two very different things. A good many other people who were in\r\nDresden at the time have let their pretty fancies run away with them;\r\nfor their accounts of Wagner's doings contradict one another to such\r\nan extent that any attempt to reconcile them is futile. I must confess\r\nto a boundless distrust of \"recollections\" set down or spoken at any\r\nlength of time after the event. Ask, reader, ask any of your friends\r\nto give an account of some striking occurrence of a year ago. In\r\nninety-nine cases out of a hundred it will not tally with yours. You\r\nmay be wrong or your friend may be wrong: in either case some one's\r\nmemory has played a trick. In this book I have omitted many a dozen\r\npicturesque touches, simply because there is no proof of their truth\r\nand every probability that they are false. It is perhaps enough to\r\nremember that the hopes of liberty were crushed, that Roeckel,\r\nWagner's assistant and friend, was taken and afterwards sentenced to a\r\nlong term of imprisonment, and that Wagner had to run for safety. From\r\nevery point of view it was as well he got away from Dresden. If he had\r\nnot got away he would have shared Roeckel's martyrdom. Had the\r\nrevolution succeeded, a terrible disillusionment would have been his\r\nshare of the spoils: the revolutionists thought a fine opera of no\r\nmore importance than did their enemies, and had Richard asked to be\r\nset up in his kingdom he would have quickly found the defenders of\r\nliberty as adroit in evading him and his claims as any court flunkeys\r\ncould be. It was well he got away from Dresden also because, as he\r\nafterwards said, the court livery had grown too tight for him. He had\r\nhad a comfortable income, and had he not been Richard Wagner he might\r\nhave vegetated happily, in the Reissiger way, for life. Minna would\r\nhave been content. Being Richard Wagner, he felt his soul strangled;\r\nand that Minna had for some time been worrying about what he might do\r\nnext is shown by his remark to a friend--that other people had their\r\nenemies outside their houses: _his_ enemy sat at his own table.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThings had not gone well at the theatre. In spite of performances\r\nnever before equalled in the town--nay, probably because of them--he\r\nhad enemies all around, especially in the Jew-controlled press. His\r\ncarefulness about rehearsals was called fussiness; his determination\r\nthat the singers should not at their own sweet pleasure mar fine\r\noperas with interpolations, alterations and \"liberties\" generally, was\r\ncalled interference with their rights. Even when he played\r\nBeethoven's Pastoral and Ninth Symphonies, as they had never been\r\ngiven before, he was impertinently taken to task by press scribblers\r\nfor departing from the Mendelssohn tradition. I have already expressed\r\nthe opinion that _Judaism in Music_ was a huge mistake; yet one must\r\nown that when one considers how the Jews consistently attacked him for\r\nventuring to challenge inferior Jew composers and conductors on their\r\nown ground, the thing seems almost excusable. At any rate, it is\r\nsurprising that he dealt so tenderly with Mendelssohn. There is one\r\npoint always to be borne in mind. Wagner was assailed at this time not\r\nso much _quâ_ composer as _quâ_ conductor. Now we of the generation of\r\nto-day--the younger members, anyhow--are so accustomed to really able\r\nconductors, that it is somewhat difficult to realize what things were\r\nlike throughout Europe in 1843-49. Perhaps the nearest approach to a\r\ntrue idea may be formed by those who heard our own precious\r\nPhilharmonic Society under the late Cusins. As in London in the\r\n'eighties, so in Dresden in the 'forties. Callous indifference to the\r\nbeauty of fine music and complete slovenliness in every detail of the\r\nrendering of it went hand in hand. If Europe to-day is stocked with\r\ncompetent conductors, that is a debt we owe to Wagner. Himself one of\r\nthe greatest conductors who has lived, he almost created a new art,\r\nand by his immediate and direct example and through his pupils Bülow,\r\nRichter, Levi and Seidl, not to mention his influence on Liszt, he\r\ncertainly created the school which has now ousted the older\r\ninartistic men. It was precisely this fact that maddened the older men\r\nand their friends.\r\n\r\nAnother discomforting circumstance was Wagner's intense Germanism. It\r\nwas through his efforts that Weber's remains were brought from the\r\nRoman Church in Moorfields and re-interred in Dresden (December,\r\n1844); for the ceremony he compiled some funeral music and delivered\r\nan oration. He was not content to claim Germany for the Germans: he\r\nclaimed all Europe, or at least all European art, for the Germans. The\r\nGermans themselves were contentedly jogging on with the hybrid music\r\nof Spontini, Bellini, Donizetti, Meyerbeer and Mendelssohn; and Wagner\r\nnever tired of telling them to create an art of their own, or really\r\nhe would have to do it for them. He did as well as talked and wrote;\r\nhe produced the nearest thing he could find to pure German opera--for\r\ninstance, Marschner's _Adolph von Nassau_ in 1845. Of course, he\r\nceased not to press Weber upon his audiences; and Weber at that period\r\nappears to have gone temporarily out of favour. Wagner lived in an\r\natmosphere of depreciation and disapprobation which must have got upon\r\nhis nerves and hastened the catastrophe--that of his taking active\r\npart in the attempted revolution. Sneers from artistic enemies\r\noutside; whimpering and nagging inside because he would not conform to\r\ncourt rules, and seek popularity as a good livery-wearing conductor\r\nshould--no wonder he gave a sigh of relief at quitting Dresden.\r\n\r\nHe had no option. The Prussian troops were ruthless; the judges were\r\npaid to \"punish\" those whose crime was fighting for their ordinary\r\nrights; and as the judges' billets would not have been worth twenty\r\nminutes' purchase if they had not obeyed orders, they cheerfully\r\nobeyed them. It is a fine thing to accept a handsome salary to do\r\ndirty work and to call the doing of it doing your \"duty\": duty is a\r\nfine word that has covered a million crimes since it was invented.\r\nBakunin, who said Richard Wagner was \"a visionary\"--obviously meaning\r\na harmless fool--and many others got long terms of imprisonment.\r\nWagner had left the town without leave, and for that offence he was\r\ndismissed from his post at the opera. Next, the police issued a\r\nwarrant for his arrest.\r\n\r\nHe had gone quietly to visit Liszt at Weimar, meaning to \"lie low\"\r\ntill the storm had blown by. He was apparently quite unconscious of\r\nhaving broken any laws. Liszt was not so easy in his mind. He made\r\ninquiries: found that Wagner must bolt at once: it is supposed he\r\nsomehow \"squared\" the local police official to defer executing the\r\nwarrant; he got a passport in a false name, and six days after his\r\narrival Richard set out again on his travels. What need be recorded\r\nabout the journey to Zurich and the getting of Minna there, will best\r\nbe described when I come to tell of his settling down in his new abode\r\nand the years he spent there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n'TANNHÄUSER'\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nWagner alternated between what we may call the worldly--the sensual or\r\nanimal, or love of outward show--and the magical, mystical or\r\nreligious. After _Die Feen_, a story of magic, he went to _Das\r\nLiebesverbot_, a story of lust; then he went on to a drama of warring\r\nambitions, with the outer brilliant show of armed men, gorgeous\r\nprocessions, conflagrations and what not in the way of spectacle.\r\nAfter that we have the _Dutchman_, strange and remote and mysterious,\r\nwith some pages of passionless ecstasy as its culminating point. The\r\nreaction came, and he wrote _Tannhäuser_, the opera we are now to\r\nexamine. It is largely based on sheer animal passion, though another\r\nreaction takes place before the end is reached. That reaction proceeds\r\nfurther in _Lohengrin_, which is sheer mysticism. _Tristan_ is pure\r\nhuman passion--Tristan's soul is the antithesis of Lohengrin's. The\r\n_Ring_ is, from beginning to end, a gorgeous spectacle, a\r\nglorification of the grandeur and loveliness of the earth, the\r\nsplendour and beauty and strength of human life. Not even Wotan's\r\nrenunciation takes away a jot from its note of praise of\r\nhumanity--one might even say praise of the joy of living. _Parsifal_\r\nis a denial of the value and richness and worthiness of human life:\r\nthe world is pushed away; and the hero attains perfect peace by\r\nshutting himself up in a monastery with no women to disturb him. John\r\nWillett recommended his son, when he went to London, to climb to the\r\ntop of the Monument--\"there are no young women up there, sir\"--and\r\nWagner evidently agreed with John Willett. Parsifal is left to pass\r\nhis days in walking, with the most preposterous steps ever seen on or\r\noff the stage, in idle processions from nowhere to nowhere without any\r\nobject beyond walking, in making meals off invisible food, in\r\nimpressing his fellow-monks with puerile chemical and electrical\r\nexperiments, and perhaps, for a change, in going out to see trees and\r\nrocks taking a constitutional. If to say this is to be flippant, well\r\nthen, I am flippant. The drama of _Parsifal_ is the least intelligent,\r\nthe most pretentious to intellectuality,-the most absurd and\r\nridiculous and mirth-provoking drama ever set to music. Or, if we must\r\nneeds oblige the Wagnerites by regarding it as a lofty contribution to\r\nethics and a philosophy, no words are strong enough to describe its\r\ninfamy. At the moment these lines are penned eager controversy is\r\ngoing on in every European capital as to whether _Parsifal_ can or\r\ncannot be produced this year without the permission of the Bayreuth\r\nclique; and my devout hope is that it will be given everywhere as soon\r\nas possible. Once it is seen without the quasi-religious, or rather\r\nmock-religious, character of the Bayreuth performances, the\r\nhollowness, trumpery staginess and evil tendency of the work will be\r\nonly too obvious, and if Bayreuth wants a monopoly of it no one will\r\nwish to say Bayreuth nay.\r\n\r\nThese oscillations of mood were very frequent, the changes often very\r\nabrupt, with Wagner; also he rarely worked at only one opera at a\r\ntime. The _Dutchman_ was conceived before _Rienzi_ was finished;\r\n_Tannhäuser_ and _Lohengrin_ were slowly shaping themselves in his\r\nimagination while he scored the _Dutchman_; the _Mastersingers_\r\nlibretto, in its first form, was drafted immediately after\r\n_Tannhäuser_ was finished, and before _Lohengrin_ was begun; the\r\ncomposition of the _Ring_, _Tristan_ and the _Mastersingers_ went on\r\nsimultaneously. He did not totally exhaust one group of ideas and\r\nemotions before proceeding to another, and the result is twofold.\r\nFirst, the moods belonging of right to one opera often found their way\r\nfor moments into another, so that the description I have given above\r\nof his various alternations is very rough, though it is in the main\r\naccurate; second, the true antipodes of one opera may not be that\r\nwhich stands next to it in chronological arrangement, but one which he\r\ndid not complete till years afterwards. I have just digressed a little\r\nabout _Parsifal_, because it, and not the _Mastersingers_, is the true\r\ncontrary and complement to _Tannhäuser_. _Parsifal_ is pitilessly\r\nlogical, _Tannhäuser_ wildly illogical; _Parsifal_ preaches the gospel\r\nof renunciation, of the will to dwarf and stunt one's physical, mental\r\nand moral growth: _Tannhäuser_ preaches nothing at all, but is an\r\naffirmation of the necessity and moral loveliness of healthy relations\r\nbetween the two sexes, with a totally uncalled-for and incredible\r\nfalling away or repentance at the end, on the part of one who has in\r\nno way sinned--to wit, Tannhäuser; the music of _Parsifal_ is sickly,\r\ntired, with mystical chants that make one's gorge rise in disgust; the\r\nmusic of _Tannhäuser_ is strong, healthy, full of manly passion--even\r\nat its saddest it is free of the nauseating whining of _Parsifal_.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTannhäuser, a knight and celebrated minstrel, led away by an\r\nexaggeration of healthy human desires, has left his friends and gone\r\nto live with Venus in the Hörselberg. He soon tires of her; she tries\r\nto keep him; he calls on the Virgin; the hallucinatory dream is\r\nshattered, and he is in the free open spring air. A shepherd boy plays\r\non his pipe and chants a song to spring; a procession of old pilgrims\r\nto Rome passes; Tannhäuser, feeling his exaggeration of passions, sane\r\nenough in themselves, to be a sin, praises the Almighty for his\r\ndeliverance from what seems now to him like an evil dream. Hunters'\r\nhorns are presently heard from all sides; enter Tannhäuser's former\r\nfriends, Walther, Wolfram, Biterolf with the rest; they try to\r\npersuade him to return to his former life with them, but in vain,\r\nuntil Wolfram tells him that by his singing he had won the heart of\r\nthe Landgrave's daughter Elisabeth, and she has pined ever since at\r\nhis unaccountable disappearance. Tannhäuser, at first incredulous, in\r\nthe end joyfully agrees to go back to the Wartburg, where the\r\nLandgrave's castle can be seen, and the merry clatter of hunting horns\r\nis heard on all sides as the curtain falls. It will be seen that there\r\nis no vestige of the old stage trickery of the _Dutchman_ here: all\r\nseems natural because all is inevitable; of songs and concerted pieces\r\nwe get plenty, but they grow spontaneously out of the drama: the drama\r\nis not twisted and delayed for the sake of getting them in.\r\n\r\nIn the second act Elisabeth has heard of her knight's return; she\r\nenters the hall of song and pours forth her feelings of thankfulness;\r\nTannhäuser comes in and begs to be favoured; there is a long\r\nlove-duet; and then preparations are made for a musical tournament.\r\nThe popular march is played; the hall becomes crowded; the Landgrave\r\nmakes a speech--satisfying to German audiences, no doubt, because it\r\npraises German valour and music--and in announcing the subject on\r\nwhich the minstrels shall enlarge, he hints that perhaps Tannhäuser in\r\nhis contribution will let them know in what mysterious lands he has\r\nsojourned during his long absence. The theme is, What is love, and how\r\ndo we recognize it? The prize will be given by the Princess, and it\r\nshall be anything the successful singer chooses--that is, it shall be\r\nthe Princess. Wolfram stands up first and praises a mild platonic\r\nattachment as being true love, and his sentiments win much applause.\r\nTannhäuser sings passionately of the joys of burning fleshly desire,\r\nthough as yet his language is a little veiled. The audience, who are\r\nthe judges, make no sign; Elisabeth alone shows that in her heart she\r\ngoes with Tannhäuser and not with Wolfram. Walther, in turn, tells\r\nTannhäuser that he knows nothing of sincere love; Tannhäuser grows\r\nangry, and scoffingly tells him that if he wants cold perfection he\r\nhad better worship the stars; but he, Tannhäuser, wants warm, living\r\nflesh and blood and healthy desires in the woman he loves. Biterolf\r\ncalls Tannhäuser a shameless blasphemer, and challenges him to combat;\r\nTannhäuser replies bitterly; the surrounding nobles want to silence\r\nhim; his anger becomes rage, and his rage madness; Wolfram tries to\r\ncalm every one, but Tannhäuser is now too far gone, and in \"wildest\r\nexaltation\" he chants the hymn he sang to Venus in the first act.\r\n\"Only in the Venusberg can one experience the joys of true love,\" he\r\nshouts; the ladies rush out in terror, leaving only Elisabeth; the men\r\nattack Tannhäuser. He would be killed, but Elisabeth suddenly\r\ninterposes--all stand aghast at the bare notion of her interceding for\r\nso shameless a wretch; but in the end she gets her way. \"Who would not\r\nyield who heard the heavenly maid?\" they sing; during a momentary\r\nstillness the voices of young pilgrims following the elder to Rome are\r\nheard; Tannhäuser is pardoned on condition of joining them and\r\nconfessing to the pope and gaining his forgiveness; and, being a man\r\nof uncontrollable passions, with fits of abject depression as low as\r\nhis ecstatic flights are high, he humbly acquiesces. The curtain comes\r\ndown in the second act as he goes off.\r\n\r\nThe third act is, I say, quite illogical unless one accepts as a\r\ntruism, as Wagner accepted it, the patent absurdity that by\r\nsacrificing him-or herself one being can save the soul of another\r\nbeing. But Wagner was not a German of the Romantic epoch for nothing.\r\nHe believed the absurdity with a fervour now laughable, and was\r\nespecially enthusiastic when the sacrificed person was a woman: woman,\r\nto his mind, was the redeemer of man: that was her _métier_. Senta\r\nredeems Vanderdecken; in his last work Kundry redeems Parsifal by\r\nthoughtfully dying so as to leave that unamiable idiot to lead the\r\nhigher life of the monastery, as I have described it. And somehow\r\nElisabeth is to redeem Tannhäuser--also, it appears, by dying at an\r\nappropriate moment. In the fit of depression and degradation following\r\nhis mad outburst the hero goes to Rome, interviews the pope, and\r\nconfesses all to him. \"If you have dwelt with Venus,\" says the Lord's\r\nvicar, \"you are for ever cursed; God will not forgive you until my\r\nstaff of dry wood blossoms.\" At this sentence of eternal doom\r\nTannhäuser, in the legend as Wagner found it, returned to the\r\nHörselberg: in the story, as Wagner shaped it, he gets as near as the\r\nWartburg on his road back to Venus. By the roadside, as in the second\r\nscene of the first act, Elisabeth is praying before the shrine where\r\nTannhäuser had knelt to thank heaven for his deliverance; Wolfram\r\nwatches near. Both await the pilgrims from Rome. These arrive--and\r\nTannhäuser is not amongst them. \"He will return no more,\" says\r\nElisabeth despairingly; and she prays to the Virgin to free her from\r\nall earth's griefs. Then she wends her way up to the castle while\r\nWolfram remains to sing his song of renunciation. Ominous sounds are\r\nheard; Tannhäuser, tattered and woe-begone, enters, tells his tale to\r\nWolfram, and, working himself into a condition of madness as he did at\r\nthe Tournament of Song--only now the madness is the madness of\r\ndespair, not excessive exaltation--he calls on Venus. From the heart\r\nof the mountain she answers; the scene grows wilder and wilder; he\r\nsees Venus awaiting him; the air is filled with strange odours and\r\nstranger music. Wolfram struggles to prevent Tannhäuser going to\r\nVenus; Venus calls him clearly and more clearly; suddenly Wolfram\r\nsays, \"A maiden is even now making intercession for you at God's\r\nthrone--Elisabeth!\" \"Elisabeth!\" echoes Tannhäuser--stunned and\r\nastonished. The mists clear away; from behind the scenes a requiem for\r\nElisabeth's soul is heard; Venus gives a final wail, \"Woe! lost to\r\nme!\" and sinks into the earth; slowly morning dawns, and a funeral\r\ntrain bearing Elisabeth on a bier slowly comes in. \"Holy Elisabeth,\r\npray for me,\" Tannhäuser cries, and, sinking down, he dies. More\r\npilgrims enter, bearing the pope's staff, which has miraculously\r\nblossomed in token that God's mercy is greater than man's, and that\r\nTannhäuser is pardoned; all sing a song of praise, and the opera\r\nterminates.\r\n\r\nAt the Dresden performances in 1845 this ending was cut, but that\r\nWagner reckoned it of the utmost importance is shown by a letter\r\nwritten to Uhlig in 1851: \"The reason for leaving out the announcement\r\nof the miracle, in the Dresden change, was quite a local one: the\r\nchorus was always bad, flat and uninteresting; also an imposing scenic\r\neffect--a splendid, gradual sunrise was wanting.\" Now, in the\r\ntwentieth century, it is indeed hard to understand how an intellect so\r\nkeen as our Richard's, a dramatic and poetic instinct almost\r\ninfallible with regard to all other things, could have failed to see\r\nand feel the absurdity of Elisabeth's death being necessary to\r\nTannhäuser's salvation. Was it the only way to get rid of the lady--a\r\n_pis aller_?--a last remnant of the old-fashioned technique? In the\r\noriginal legend Tannhäuser goes back to Venus: that would be\r\nineffective and leave Elisabeth's future unprovided for. On the other\r\nhand, Wagner would never have selected the story for operatic\r\ntreatment at all had it not instantly shaped itself in his mind as it\r\nnow stands: he was, I say, obsessed by this notion of man's redemption\r\nby woman; it was part of his creed and not to be questioned. So I\r\nthink that we must simply take it as it is, accepting Wagner's creed\r\nfor the moment as a necessary convention. At the same time let us\r\nrealize that it is an illogical development of the drama and not, as\r\nthe Wagnerites comically insist, the symbol of an eternal verity.\r\nAllowing for the time occupied in mediæval days by the journey from\r\nRome to the heart of Germany, the pope's staff must have burst into\r\nleaf and flower long, long before Elisabeth's death. While she was\r\nwaiting for Tannhäuser to come in with the first band of pilgrims, the\r\nsecond band was already on its way with the token of his pardon. We\r\nneed not be too inquisitive and wonder why Tannhäuser should be\r\nexpected back with the first band when he had set out with the second,\r\nand why Elisabeth could not at least exercise a little patience and\r\nwait for the second. The point is that she does not wait, but goes\r\nhome to die, and, dying, is supposed--as Wolfram explicitly states--to\r\nredeem a sinner who is already redeemed. Her sacrifice is an act of\r\nsuicidal insanity due to her lacking the common sense to reflect that\r\nTannhäuser might arrive with the second contingent; it is foolish and\r\nsuperfluous.\r\n\r\nThis is the sole flaw in a very fine opera book. _Tannhäuser_ is the\r\nnoblest expression in music of the glory and worth of human life. An\r\nassertion of the glory and worth of human life is bound to be, as\r\n_Tannhäuser_ is, tragic; life and the value of life can only be\r\nrealized when we see life in conflict with death and overcome by\r\ndeath. All the great tragedies are assertions of the joy of living, in\r\nthe deepest sense of the phrase--in the sense in which _Samson\r\nAgonistes_ or Handel's _Samson_ are such assertions. Tannhäuser\r\nsuffers defeat and is glorious, like Samson in his overthrow. Even\r\nElisabeth, a trifle mawkish though she may be, has loved life, and\r\nonly at the finish, when fate (or, as she would say, heaven) decides\r\nagainst her, does she resign herself and renounce what cannot be hers.\r\nThis is the first of Wagner's operas the plot of which is virtually\r\nall his own; for precisely the combination of the legend of Tannhäuser\r\nwith the Tournament of Song makes it what it is and was--Wagner's\r\ninvention. All the stale old devices of explanatory asides are gone,\r\nas are the convenient goings-off and comings-on of the _dramatis\r\npersonæ_ at the sweet will of the composer who wants here a duet and a\r\ntrio there. The drama is self-explanatory--the librettist does not\r\nshove on a character to explain it for him; as it unfolds, the\r\nmusician is given ample opportunities for all the songs or concerted\r\npieces that the heart of composer could long for--he has not by main\r\nforce and at all costs (in the way of unreasonableness) to drive\r\nopportunities into the drama.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIn 1842 Wagner finished first _Rienzi_ and then the _Dutchman_; in\r\nApril of 1845, that is to say three years later, _Tannhäuser_ was\r\ncomplete, and in October of that year it was produced at Dresden. Its\r\nsuccess or non-success with the public and those strange animals the\r\ncritics does not greatly concern us to-day. Wagner's own account of\r\nthe proceedings is not very trustworthy. The opera was cut and\r\ndoctored to suit the singers--notably Tichatscheck; the first\r\nperformance seems to have missed fire, and at the second the house was\r\nempty; at the third it was full; and, but for the intrigues of some\r\nof the musicians and scribblers, and the insanity of the management,\r\nit appears probable--one has a right to use so moderate a word--that\r\nbefore long it might have won in Dresden the success it presently won\r\nthroughout Europe. That, I say, is not a matter for the twentieth\r\ncentury to worry about; but the twentieth century is bound to marvel\r\nover the obtuseness of the middle nineteenth in not recognizing the\r\nadvent of the greatest power that had yet meddled with high and\r\nserious opera. (I do not mean that Wagner's was a greater musical\r\npower than Mozart's and Beethoven's. But Mozart never had a libretto\r\nto compare with Wagner's; and _Fidelio_, though serious enough in all\r\nconscience, is not an opera at all.) In three years, 1842-45, the\r\ngrowth of Wagner's strength was astounding, incredible. One sees at\r\nonce how the old stage devices have departed from the libretto, and\r\nwith them the fragmentary and jerky style of music; the intermittent\r\ninspiration of the _Dutchman_ is replaced by an unchecked torrent of\r\ninspired music. All the little suggestions of Bellini and Donizetti\r\nare clean gone; the amorphous melody of the _Dutchman_ is gone, or\r\nmetamorphosed by being charged with energy, colour and meaning; every\r\nphrase has character, and communicates a very definite shade of\r\nfeeling; in every phrase we feel how intense has been the inner\r\nthought and emotion, and with what terrible directness these are\r\ncommunicated to us. I say terrible directness because it is in\r\n_Tannhäuser_ that we first find the godlike Wagner hurling his\r\nthunderbolts. It was Spohr who spoke of the godlike or titanic energy\r\nof the music, and this energy finds expression, not as it did in\r\n_Rienzi_, in noisy orchestration, big ensembles and thumping rhythms,\r\nbut, in a far greater degree than in the _Dutchman_, in the stuff of\r\nthe music itself. We find no more lumpish harmonies and basses of\r\nleaden immovability: the basses stalk about with arrogant\r\nindependence, and the harmonic progressions, even when most daring and\r\nperilous, are superbly poised. The old awkwardnesses, due to the\r\nendeavour to copy and to be original at the same time, have\r\ndisappeared. Wagner wrote _Tannhäuser_ entirely to express and to\r\nplease himself: he had given up the notion of being original; he was\r\nbent only on being himself.\r\n\r\nHe boasted that here, at last, was a sheer German opera. Well, that is\r\nnot in itself very much. Personally, I would rather be an Englishman\r\nthan a German; and few of us will be prepared to accept the view that\r\nbecause a work of art, or so-called work of art, happens to be by a\r\nGerman, it must therefore be a great work of art, or even a work of\r\nart at all. Richard never lived down the tendency, natural in one, I\r\nsuppose, of a conquered tribe (the Saxons), to incorporate and\r\nidentify himself with his conquerors, and he glorified everything\r\nPrussian as German, and everything German as perfect; but, even so\r\nlate as 1852, I cannot imagine that he quite understood what he meant\r\nwhen he held forth on the subject of German art, its non-existence,\r\nand--of all things--its supremacy. He certainly felt very keenly what\r\nmany members of every half-grown nation must feel--the necessity of\r\nacquiring a national conscience, artistic or other; he wanted to\r\ncreate an art-work which would appeal to the heart and understanding\r\nof every German, and would make the Germans feel themselves one race,\r\nan entity. Which, precisely, of the German races he would have\r\naccepted in the new brotherhood of man I cannot say. But the point is\r\nthat Wagner longed to create, and in _Tannhäuser_ thought he had\r\ncreated, this universal work of art; and in declaring, as he did, that\r\nhe had achieved the feat, he was revealing the truth about himself. He\r\nhad thrown overboard Bellini, Donizetti, even Spontini and Marschner,\r\nand by going back to his first idols, Beethoven and Weber (especially\r\nWeber), he found his natural voice and mode of expression.\r\nParadoxically, _Tannhäuser_, while one of his least original\r\ncompositions--owing as much to Weber as ever one composer had owed to\r\nanother--is one of his most original. He spoke the matter that was in\r\nhis own heart, but he freely, without self-consciousness, used the\r\nWeber idiom.\r\n\r\nBefore examining the means by which the varying atmospheres of the\r\ndifferent scenes are got, I ask the reader to notice the way in which\r\nthe rather pointless, inexpressive melody of the _Dutchman_ appears\r\nnow again, but so transformed as to be scarce recognizable. Compare\r\nthe musical illustration (_o_) on page 119 with (_a_) at the end of\r\nthis chapter. The type of tune is the same, but the first is\r\ncommonplace and not quite worthy of the situation in which it occurs;\r\nthe second has a glorious, though dignified, swing, and thoroughly\r\nexpresses the words of welcome which Wolfram addresses to the errant\r\nTannhäuser. Compare Daland's song in the _Dutchman_ with Wolfram's\r\ndescription of how Elisabeth has pined, or Senta's last passages in\r\nthe final scene with Elisabeth's salute to the hall of song. We feel\r\nat once how, by dropping Italian, French and mediocre German models,\r\nand writing in the way that came natural to him, Wagner at once became\r\na composer of the first rank, from whom great expressive melodies\r\nsprang spontaneously. The noble passages in the _Dutchman_ were drawn\r\nout of him, despite his conscious or unconscious imitation of what\r\nwere considered the best models of the day, by sheer force of feeling;\r\nand I pointed out how, when the situation gave him a chance, he took\r\nit. In _Tannhäuser_ he has become a splendid artist whose brain\r\nrefused to shape the commonplace. Later on his style was to become\r\nmore individual, more purely his own; but so far he had now got--and\r\nit was a very long way. The pilgrims' chorus melody, which first\r\nappears in the overture, is, to my mind, very Weberesque. It is not\r\nparticularly strong--for Wagner--and hardly bears the weight of the\r\nbrass with which it is afterwards thundered out; but think of it and\r\nof Rienzi's prayer! The second part, of course, is Wagner at a sublime\r\nheight, but of that presently. What I wish is to give examples of how\r\nhe has discarded all the involutions, convolutions, twiddles and\r\ntwaddles of melody, and gone back to the simplicity and directness of\r\nWeber and Beethoven. His earlier manner and type of tune, the\r\noperatic manner of his day, had, I make no doubt, its origin in the\r\nadvisability, not to say the necessity, of writing so as to please\r\nsingers who could sing in the Italian style and no other. Wagner had\r\nnow ceased to think of singers' whims. He had a matter to find\r\nutterance for, and he went to work in the most direct way, considering\r\nnothing but his artistic aim. We know he conceived _Tannhäuser_ at a\r\nwhite heat, and in a condition of white heat wrote the words; and\r\nthough he afterwards cooled down and had, he said, to \"warm up\" to his\r\nwork again, yet he warmed up so effectually that he composed at\r\nfurious speed, haunted by a terror lest he should not live to complete\r\nthe opera. This fervour alone might account for his artistic\r\ndevelopment in the _Tannhäuser_ period. It drove him to find the\r\nsecret of the one true mode of expression--the law of simplicity, the\r\nunvarying rule that anything more than is needed for the expression of\r\nthe thing to be expressed is bad art, and, in the long run,\r\nineffective. With greater simplicity in the melody came the greatest\r\npossible simplicity in the harmony. There is a kind of awkwardness to\r\nbe found in the music of all the pundits which almost defies analysis.\r\nThe progressions are correct enough, are good enough grammar, yet the\r\nresult is more disconcerting, even distressing, to the ear than a\r\nschoolboy's first efforts. Of this style of harmony the Italians were\r\nmasters, and too often in his _Rienzi_ days Wagner, thinking of his\r\n\"melody\" (for at that time by \"melody\" he meant Bellini melody),\r\nshowed how little they could teach him in this respect. With the\r\nsimpler \"melody\" went the harmony--complicated as you like when the\r\noccasion called, but never more complicated than the occasion\r\nwarranted. Compare with the war-chorus and march in _Rienzi_ the march\r\nin the second act of _Tannhäuser_, and the difference will be seen.\r\nThis march, by the way, ought to have been signed \"after C.M. von\r\nWeber.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n_Tannhäuser_ was written in an epoch of long or big works of every\r\ndescription. Think of the length of the novels of Thackeray and\r\nDickens; think of the interminable _Ring and the Book_! Our immediate\r\nancestors were a long-enduring, often long-suffering, generation.\r\nPerhaps they liked good value for their money. If so, Richard gave\r\nthem what they wanted. He himself must have felt he had done so in\r\n_Tannhäuser_, for fond though he was of his own music, he allowed it\r\nto be cut freely. Even as it stands, the finale of the second act is\r\npreposterous: the ripe and perfect artist who planned _Tristan_ would\r\nnever have done such a thing. But with regard to the finales--and they\r\nare all too long--it certainly appears that Wagner deliberately made\r\nuse of crowds of people and masses of tone to carry through and\r\nemphasize his dramatic purpose. In the first act every one is rejoiced\r\nto have Tannhäuser amongst them, and Tannhäuser himself has much to\r\nsay on finding himself free of the Hörselberg nightmare, and in\r\nfamiliar, homely, human scenes once more. The anger of the nobles in\r\nthe second, Elisabeth's grief and intercession for her lover, her\r\nself-abasement--it is part of the drama to make us feel these things\r\nand time is required. The finale of the last act I give up altogether.\r\nNor can I understand why Elisabeth's prayer should be so long drawn\r\nout. Elisabeth has \"nothing to do with the case.\" However, Wagner\r\nthought she had; so we can only be thankful when she finishes, and\r\nafter Wolfram's song the action recommences with the entry of\r\nTannhäuser. The opera is planned on a huge scale, and in such works\r\n_longueurs_ are apt to occur.\r\n\r\nThe overture foretells the drama that is to ensue, but not\r\nconsecutively as in the _Dutchman_. We have the pilgrims' hymn, the\r\nsecond section of which is one of those things of which one can truly\r\nsay that only Richard Wagner could have penned them. The accent of\r\ngrief is intensely passionate, yet it remains solemn, sublime. Then\r\nthe Bacchanal music and Tannhäuser's chant in praise of Venus are\r\nheard; but all the tumult dies down, and the pilgrims end the piece\r\nnot as it began, but triumphantly. We have here, as I have said, the\r\ngreat Wagner, working confidently and with ease on a vast scale. The\r\ncurtain rises; and if we could not see the scene the music would tell\r\nus of the billows of hot rose mist, and the dancers working themselves\r\nup to frenzy. There is a hush, and the sweetest song ever sung by\r\nsirens is heard, full of languor and soft seductiveness. When\r\nTannhäuser starts up declaring he has heard the village chime in his\r\ndreams, it is as if a breath of cool air, laden with the fragrance of\r\nwild flowers, blew into that hot, steaming cavern. Music of\r\nunimaginable beauty and freshness sings of the pleasant earth--the\r\ngreen spring, the nightingale. When Venus coaxes him, he responds with\r\none of the world's greatest songs--the hymn to Venus. Her \"Geliebter,\r\nkomm\" is another piece of magic. The very essence of sensuality is in\r\nit, and never was sin made to seem so lovely. One great theme follows\r\nanother. \"Hin zu den kalten Menschen flieh'\" is almost Schubertian in\r\nits spontaneity. The music never flags; there are scarcely any of the\r\nold formulas--not even, for example, to express Venus's anger; the\r\nfund of melody seems inexhaustible. Three main points may be observed.\r\nFirst, the dramatic propriety of every phrase is perfect--the music\r\nwanted for each successive situation fitly to express the emotion of\r\nthe situation is infallibly forthcoming; the music invariably reveals\r\nthe inwardness of the situation. Second, in spite of following the\r\ndrama, move by move, so to speak, the continuity of the musical flow\r\nis absolute; phrase seems to grow out of phrase (the drama being true\r\nand the music always exactly expressive of the essence of the drama,\r\nthis follows as night the day); and partly by reason of this, and\r\npartly owing to the simplicity of the themes and tunes, the total\r\neffect is one of stately breadth. Third, the wealth of invention, the\r\nconstructive power, and the command of technical devices, place Wagner\r\nin the first rank of sheer musicians. True, he could not write a\r\nsymphony such as Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven wrote; but neither could\r\nthey have written a music-drama; the music-drama was his form, the\r\nsymphony theirs.\r\n\r\nIn the next scene we have music of a different sort. A shepherd-boy\r\npipes and sings one of those songs which, for freshness and purity,\r\nseem unapproachable--the watchman's song in the first act of the\r\n_Dutchman_ is another example. The piping goes on while the elder\r\npilgrims chant a sort of marching tune as they pass--part of it is the\r\nsecond section of the great hymn already described--the boy shouts\r\n\"Good luck!\" after them, and Tannhäuser, in an ecstasy of relief and\r\nrestfulness after the unceasing whirl of lust and fleshly delights\r\nfrom which he has found deliverance, pours forth his soul in a\r\nwonderful phrase. It is repeated afterwards when Tannhäuser very\r\nguardedly tells Elisabeth of the wonder of his deliverance; and indeed\r\nit is expressive of a mood that became more and more characteristic of\r\nWagner as he grew older, as though he got momentary glimpses of some\r\nblessed isle of rest where peace and relief from all earthly troubles\r\ncould be found. A few years later we find him writing to Liszt of his\r\nlonging for death as an escape; and though his appetite remained good,\r\nand he seemed bent on having the best of everything on his table, we\r\ncan well believe that, overstrung by nature, in constant poor health,\r\nand making stupendous demands on his nervous energy (like his own\r\nTannhäuser), doing everything too much, he had moments--nay, days--of\r\nreaction and feelings which he expressed quite sincerely in his\r\nletters. This brief passage touches the sublime. The hunters enter,\r\nand from the moment Wolfram begins his really beautiful song about\r\nElisabeth, it remains on Wagner's highest level. The finale is a set\r\npiece, of course, and is in free and joyous contrast to the lurid heat\r\nand sensual abandonment of the first scene. While the trees wave in\r\nthe wind and the sun shines, the men shout merrily, and the huntsmen\r\nblow away at their horns--and Tannhäuser has returned to his former\r\nhealthy life.\r\n\r\nIn the second act we have Elisabeth's greeting to the hall of song,\r\nvery charming; a duet with Tannhäuser, very fine in parts, but not a\r\ntrue love-duet; the popular march; and then the tournament. Now,\r\nWolfram's bid for favour seems to me both too literal and too long. He\r\ndoes what undoubtedly the minstrels of old did--freely declaims his\r\nverses, occasionally twanging his harp. He grows indeed almost fervent\r\nin his praise of the quiet life, of adoring your beloved at a safe\r\ndistance and never disturbing her (nor yourself) with a word about\r\nhuman passion; but, for my humble part, I beg to say I always share\r\nTannhäuser's impatience and am glad when it is over. As soon as\r\nTannhäuser gets up the mighty spirit of Wagner begins to work. With a\r\ndramatic abruptness that startles one, a fragment of a Venusberg theme\r\nshoots up; then a few chords, and Tannhäuser begins praise of the\r\nthing he understands by love. His strains are impassioned--too much so\r\nfor another of the troubadours, Walther, who follows somewhat in\r\nWolfram's manner, but with much more energy. Again there is, as it\r\nwere, a glimpse of the Venusberg fire in the orchestra, and Tannhäuser\r\nsings another song, more intense, again, in passion than his first,\r\nand ending with an aggressively fierce declaration of his creed.\r\nBiterolf challenges him; the Venusberg music boils up once more--we\r\nalmost see the vision that is about to break on Tannhäuser's inner\r\nsight; he sings more passionately still the joys of a human love;\r\nWolfram again contends, giving us this time a really glorious song,\r\nand the storm breaks: the Venusberg is before Tannhäuser's eyes; the\r\nviolins sweep to their highest register, and remain there boiling and\r\ndancing in a kind of divine fury; and in mad exaltation he chants his\r\nhymn to Venus. Then the commotion occurs as I have described.\r\n\r\nLet us consider this scene a moment. For theatrical effect, in the\r\nbest sense, it is in most respects one of the greatest Wagner wrote.\r\nThere is the pomp of the entry of the knights and ladies, and\r\nafterwards of the minstrels; the Landgrave's music is effective, which\r\nis more than can be said for that usually allotted to the heavy father\r\nin an opera; the business of arranging the order in which the\r\ncompetitors shall stand up is accompanied by fragments of the graceful\r\nmarch--or, rather, processional--to which the minstrels had entered,\r\nand these come as a welcome preparation of the ear for the essential\r\npart of the scene. Wolfram's first effort, I say, I can hardly\r\ntolerate, considered as a piece of composition; yet, shortened, it\r\nwould be admirably in place. From the moment Tannhäuser begins all is\r\nperfect. Tannhäuser's music grows in intensity, and Wagner is careful\r\nnot to give us a setback by allowing the other singers to throw\r\nWolfram-ian cold douches over us; on the contrary, they get excited,\r\ntoo; and the orchestra is let loose with them by degrees, until in the\r\nlast outburst it is blazing and crackling as though it had gone as\r\ncompletely mad as Tannhäuser himself. The whole thing, with the\r\nreservation I have made, must be admitted to be consummately managed\r\nfrom the composer's as well as from the dramatist's point of view.\r\n\r\nWhat follows needs little discussion. Wagner knew quite well how to\r\nrepresent a row on the stage without passing beyond the limits of what\r\nis music. Here we have ample energy, but nothing demanding closer\r\nnotice until Elisabeth's interposition. Then at once we get stuff on a\r\nhigh level. The culmination is reached in a series of melodies hardly\r\nto be matched for pathetic beauty; the orchestra seems to throb with\r\nemotion--a device which Wagner often employed extensively in the\r\n_Ring_--the chorus join in, and a wondrous effect is obtained. The\r\nensemble is the last piece of this description Wagner was destined to\r\nwrite. It is pure emotion, and not dramatic--that is, not\r\ntheatrical--and its warrant is that the drama at the moment is nothing\r\nbut a drama of emotions in conflict. The only musical-and-dramatic\r\neffect now occurs where the voices of the young pilgrims are heard: it\r\nis electrical.\r\n\r\nWagner gave a title to the prelude of Act III, \"Tannhäuser's\r\nPilgrimage,\" and it differs only in that from his other preludes and\r\novertures. To those who know what is to follow it tells a story more\r\nor less distinctly, while those who hear it for the first time must\r\nfeel the atmosphere and emotion, and thus be prepared for the drama.\r\nIt is built up of the pilgrims' marching song and one of Elisabeth's\r\nmelodies and a most expressive theme which depicts Tannhäuser\r\npainfully getting over the weary miles, with a sad heart, to seek the\r\npope's pardon; then comes in the Dresden Amen--the significance of\r\nwhich will appear presently--then a crash followed by a mournful\r\nphrase (taken entire from Beethoven), and some recitative-like\r\npassages leading direct to the rising of the curtain. As music it is a\r\nsplendid thing, and, as I have said, it tells its tale plainly, when\r\none knows the tale. Almost immediately we hear the pilgrims' hymn of\r\nrejoicing, with which the overture begins--the hymn of those whose\r\nsins have been taken away. The pilgrims pass; Tannhäuser is not\r\namongst them, and Wagner there gives Elisabeth a phrase which makes\r\none think that he had Schröder-Devrient in his mind when he wrote the\r\npart. That gifted lady used--Berlioz said abused--the device of\r\noccasionally speaking, not singing, a few words; and here, where\r\nElisabeth, in despair, says, \"Er kehret nicht zurück,\" Wagner gives\r\nher notes that can be either spoken or sung, and certainly are most\r\neffective when spoken. The part, by the way, was not \"created\" by the\r\nSchröder-Devrient, but by Johanna Wagner, the daughter of that brother\r\nAlbert who had given him his first post in a theatre. I have nothing\r\nfurther to say about the Prayer, nor about the \"Star of Eve\" song. As\r\nnight gathers over the autumn scene and Tannhäuser enters, the music\r\nat once leaps to life. Not that we have not heard some very lovely\r\nthings, notably a quotation in the orchestra from one of Wolfram's\r\ncompetition songs; the star shines out, and Wolfram, his harp now\r\nsilent, sits gazing dreamily up in the direction Elisabeth has taken\r\nhomeward to die. But now we get a renewal of the furious energy of the\r\ntournament scene. As Tannhäuser declares his intention of returning to\r\nVenus, the music crackles and roars for a moment; then it subsides to\r\nbroken phrases of utter despair as he describes his journey to Rome.\r\nThe Dresden Amen accompanies him at first with ethereal effect, and\r\nafterwards with the utmost grandeur, as he tells how he knelt before\r\nthe Rood to pray--in a few bars every aspect of St. Peter's is brought\r\nto our minds, and the atmosphere and colour. Wagner himself never\r\nsurpassed the declamatory passage of the pope's curse. Bach and Mozart\r\nknew how to write recitative, but they rarely attempted to fill it\r\nwith anything approaching the intensity of meaning with which this\r\nterrible recitative is filled. Then, again, the music boils, and with\r\nunearthly effects the themes from the Hörselberg scene sound out, now\r\nfrom behind the scenes, now from the orchestra; the thing grows madder\r\nand more mad, until suddenly Wolfram perceives the bier bearing\r\nElisabeth being carried down. \"Elisabeth!\" he cries, and a requiem is\r\nheard from behind the scenes. As a stage effect I know only one thing\r\nto match it. In _Hamlet_ the hero has been philosophizing to his\r\nheart's content, when a funeral procession approaches--\r\n\r\n    _Hamlet_: What, the fair Ophelia?\r\n\r\n    _Queen_: Sweets to the sweet, farewell....\r\n\r\nEvery one knows the magic of that stroke: the abrupt change of key,\r\nthe instant disappearance of bitterness, and the introduction of\r\npathos and pure beauty; so here the Venusberg music disappears like a\r\nflame that is blown out. \"Elisabeth!\" Tannhäuser echoes, and the\r\nchorus chants solemnly \"Der Seele Heil,\" etc. \"Henry, thou art\r\nredeemed,\" cries Wolfram; and then we have the final scene, the entry\r\nof the young penitents with the pope's staff. The final chorus is\r\neffective enough, though it suggests the audience getting up and\r\nlooking for their hats.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, the music of _Tannhäuser_ is characterized by intense\r\nenergy, the greatest definiteness, and richness and gorgeousness of\r\ncolouring. Inviting as must have been the opportunities offered in the\r\nopening scene of indulging in a riot of voluptuous colour, the\r\ndefiniteness is never lost. Through the whirling, dancing-mad\r\naccompaniment runs a fibre of strong, clean-cut, sinewy melody. The\r\npicture is drawn with firm strokes as well as painted with a full\r\nbrush. Or perhaps the better analogy would be to describe each scene\r\nas an architecturally constructed fabric; and each is also so\r\nconstructed as to lead inevitably into the next. Hence, as already\r\npointed out, the artistic restraint and breadth in scenes where, with\r\nsuch heat of passion at work, we might fear spasmodic jerkiness.\r\n\r\nWhen _Tannhäuser_ was published, Wagner sent the score to Schumann,\r\nand Mendelssohn also saw it. The comment of the latter was\r\ncharacteristic: he liked a canon entry in the finale of the second\r\nact; and indeed it was too much to hope that the successful purveyor\r\nof oratorios should like or in the least understand so mighty, fresh\r\nand passionate an opera. He did not understand Beethoven, and\r\nvirtually admitted as much without realizing how completely he had\r\ncommitted himself. Moreover, opera was a form of art with which he had\r\nno real sympathy. It is true his friend Devrient tells us that he was\r\nanxious to write one, and would have done so had not his fastidious\r\ntaste prevented him ever finding a libretto to his liking--which is\r\nequivalent to saying a man would have painted a fine picture could he\r\nonly have secured a good subject. In some respects Schumann was even\r\nmore antipathetic. Wagner, all who knew him declare, never ceased\r\ntalking; Schumann was a silent man--sometimes in a café a friend might\r\nspeak to him: Schumann would turn his back to the friend and his face\r\nto the wall, and continue to imbibe lager. Wagner would talk for an\r\nhour, and, getting no response, go away; he would afterwards declare\r\nSchumann an \"impossible\" man, out of whom not a word could be got;\r\nwhile Schumann would declare he could not tolerate Wagner, \"his tongue\r\nnever stops.\" Schumann had no dramatic instinct, and no comprehension\r\nfor opera; in _Genoveva_--as, in fact, in his so-called dramatic\r\ncantatas--he failed utterly: he went straight through the words,\r\nsetting them to music _pur et simple_, taking no thought for dramatic\r\npropriety. The score of _Tannhäuser_ simply puzzled him; he saw in it\r\nonly the music _pur et simple_, considered as which it was, of course,\r\nvery bad. It was not bad in all the ways he thought, however. His\r\nremark about the clumsy orchestration long ago returned to roost. For\r\nthe rest, when he saw the opera performed he changed part of his mind,\r\nand wrote admitting that much which he did not like on paper seemed in\r\nplace when the work was sung, and some of it \"moved me much.\" Some\r\ntime afterwards he played some of his music to Wagner, who found it\r\nmuddled, as if the sustaining pedal was held down all the time--and I\r\nhave no doubt it was. Another gentleman who saw the score was\r\nHanslick, then a young man looking around for some one to attach\r\nhimself to--a peripatetic barnacle. Later, he found Brahms, as all the\r\nworld soon found out, and revised his early notions of the greater\r\nmusician. But at first he was all enthusiasm and gush, and wrote\r\narticles \"explaining\" _Tannhäuser_. However, his views are of no\r\nimportance to-day. Liszt, generous soul, had the opera played at\r\nWeimar at the earliest possible moment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n'LOHENGRIN'\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n_Lohengrin_ was first drafted in 1845--for Wagner during this period\r\nallowed no grass to grow under his feet. He was a member of a coterie\r\nthat met at Angell's restaurant, and there on November 17 he read the\r\ncomplete libretto to his friends and acquaintances. Schumann was\r\namongst them, and he bluntly asserted that such a libretto could not\r\nbe set. Others were more favourable, but many were doubtful. However,\r\nthat made little difference to Richard. He knew his own strength and\r\ntrusted his instinct; and however much he was urged to alter the\r\n_dénouement_, he stuck to his guns and his libretto.\r\n\r\nIn point of structure the libretto of _Lohengrin_ closely resembles\r\nthat of its predecessor. There are even fewer set pieces, there are\r\nmore fragmentary speeches. The drama is so contrived as to let in the\r\nset pieces naturally: of the old forced operatic business of sending\r\nout or bringing in characters as seems advisable there is not a sign.\r\nThe story is on the whole simpler than that of _Tannhäuser_. Lohengrin\r\nis son of Parsifal, head of the mystic Montsalvat monastery where the\r\nHoly Grail is kept; where the monks never seem precisely to die; and\r\nwhere, without marriage and even without women, children are somehow\r\nborn to the favoured ones. He comes in a magic boat drawn by a swan\r\nto aid Elsa against Telramund and his wife, who falsely accuse her of\r\nhaving murdered her brother; he fights for her and overcomes the\r\naccusers, first exacting a promise that she will never ask him his\r\nname nor where he comes from. She promises, yielding herself\r\nunconditionally to him; and so ends Act One. Next Ortrud, wife of\r\nTelramund, gets Elsa's ear, begging for mercy, and contrives to poison\r\nthe girl's mind with doubts regarding Lohengrin; and when later the\r\nwedding procession is nearing the church, Telramund himself accuses\r\nLohengrin before the king and all the crowd of sorcery and witchcraft.\r\nNothing happens at the moment; Telramund is pushed on one side, and\r\nthe procession goes its way. But in the next act, when Lohengrin and\r\nElsa are left alone she can no longer restrain her curiosity nor\r\nconceal her fears: in spite of his warnings she questions him. At the\r\nmoment Telramund and other nobles rush in to assassinate him; he kills\r\nTelramund, orders the other nobles to bear the body into the judgment\r\nhall, and tells Elsa he must leave her. In the next scene he reveals\r\nhimself, and the swan returns to take him away. Ortrud mocks him and\r\ntells how she, after all, has triumphed, for she changed Elsa's\r\nbrother into a swan; Lohengrin kneels and prays; the swan disappears\r\nand the missing brother springs up; a dove descends and is attached by\r\nLohengrin to the boat, and he goes back to Montsalvat.\r\n\r\nNow I would ask the reader if this story is reasonable, if any\r\n\"meaning\" or moral can be read into it. On the face of it Lohengrin's\r\nconditions are preposterous. Yet he is bound by the laws of the magic\r\ndomain he comes from; he trusts Elsa and does battle on her behalf\r\nwithout any proof of her innocence; and she has no patience to wait\r\nfor him to explain matters. On the other hand, he hears her prayer in\r\na magical way, and comes drawn in a magic boat; and she has a perfect\r\nright to assume that he would not have fought for her if he had not\r\nknown by his arts that she was innocent. It was just over this\r\n_dénouement_, this forsaking of Elsa because of her inquisitiveness,\r\nthat many of Wagner's friends boggled; and nothing that he then or\r\nafterwards wrote in defence of it seems to me worth a moment's serious\r\nconsideration. Mr. Ernest Newman suggests that perhaps Wagner was\r\nusing the savage's notion that in giving up your name you are placing\r\nyourself in some one's power; but there is not a hint of that in the\r\ndrama. The thing to me is simply a fairy story. We must accept\r\nLohengrin and the conditions in which he lives, moves and has his\r\nbeing. He is not his own master: somewhere far away he has an\r\nall-powerful over-lord who, for no useful purpose to be comprehended\r\nby mortal, sent him to rescue Elsa under these conditions. And I say\r\nthat, far from having a meaning, a \"purpose,\" _Lohengrin_ is pure\r\nromance, as innocent of moral ideas as any genuine mediæval romance.\r\nWagner's \"explanations,\" like Bishop Berkeley's, take a great deal of\r\nexplaining; and though Glasenapp, Wolzogen and the rest have covered\r\nmany reams of paper in doing it, we are not an inch nearer to\r\nperceiving a grain of sense in the whole affair. There is only one\r\npart of it which can be, in one sense, explained--Wagner's intense\r\nacrimony in his treatment of the female puppet Elsa. Even in 1845 he\r\nhad grown restive under the insults and stupidity of court officials\r\nand the Press, and doubtless he had threatened often enough to quit\r\nfor ever the degraded German theatre. He never could see that the\r\nGerman theatre had never been any better than it then was, but on the\r\ncontrary, a great deal worse; he never realized that it was on the\r\nup-grade, and that he was to be instrumental in elevating it. He was\r\nlike a mechanic called in (by destiny) to repair a rickety machine,\r\nwho because it won't go when he \"wills\" it, kicks it to pieces. The\r\nReissigers and the rest were simply parts of the machine that were out\r\nof order: time and patience were required to eliminate them and put in\r\nsound working parts. Wagner could not understand this any more than he\r\ncould understand why all German (or rather, Saxon) mankind should not\r\nat once be perfect, think alike and form the ideal State. So, as he\r\ncould not kick the Dresden Court Opera to pieces, he long meditated\r\nquitting it--so much he explicitly affirmed afterwards--and he must\r\nhave worried Minna sadly. She understood neither his qualities nor his\r\ndefects, his ideals nor the short-sighted impatience which rendered it\r\nimpossible for him ever to attain them: she saw only too clearly that\r\nat any moment he might kick over the traces, and that the starvation\r\nand misery of the Paris episode would have to be faced again. We can\r\nreadily picture him coming in raging after a conflict at the theatre\r\nwith official imbecility, and Minna, instead of sympathizing,\r\ncounselling him to be wise and temporize. His exasperation grew, and\r\nonly the events of 1849 prevented a rupture--so much seems\r\ncertain--and he vented his spleen by making Elsa a stupid, shallow,\r\nfaithless creature who feels no gratitude towards the hero who saved\r\nher from being burnt, but by maddening female pertinacity,\r\nwrong-headedness and wilfulness destroys her own and his happiness. As\r\nthe reader will perceive later, I by no means defend Wagner in this\r\ndomestic squabbling, but something must be said for him; I don't say,\r\neither, that he created Elsa to express his views about his wife, but\r\nI do say that his feelings account for the excess of his rancour\r\nagainst his own creation. So pitiable a specimen of feminine\r\ninquisitiveness, bad temper and ungenerosity has never been put on the\r\nstage as the heroine of a grand opera. Possibly Lohengrin saw this;\r\nand, neglecting his recent marriage-vow, he went back to Montsalvat,\r\nwhere, as we know, there were no women. All this would have to be said\r\nin the course of this book; and I say it now because it helps us to\r\nunderstand a defect in the art of a beautiful opera.\r\n\r\nA beautiful opera _Lohengrin_ certainly is--the most beautiful of all\r\nWagner's operas. The story of it is a fairy story, as I have said, and\r\nsuperficially a very ordinary sort of fairy story. We have the\r\ndistressed maiden in the hands of persecutors, the knightly hero who\r\nrescues her, the maiden's faithlessness, and the contemptuous\r\ndeparture of the hero. But Wagner has clothed the whole of this\r\nwork-a-day mediæval legend in a wondrous atmosphere of mystical\r\nbeauty, and that beauty springs from the thought of the river.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to discuss as briefly as may be the leitmotiv, because\r\nwith _Lohengrin_ Wagner first began to use it with serious purpose. In\r\nthe _Dutchman_ two themes may be rightly described as leitmotivs; in\r\n_Tannhäuser_ not one theme may be rightly so described. While in\r\n_Lohengrin_ Wagner showed himself as much as ever the inspired\r\nmusician, he made for the first time use of the leitmotiv for dramatic\r\nas well as musical ends. There we find three leitmotivs: one intended\r\nby the power of association of ideas to evoke on the instant the\r\nvision of Montsalvat and the Grail; a second to recall the thought and\r\nemotion of Lohengrin the man; the third to remind us of the conditions\r\nwhich Lohengrin imposes on Elsa before he is willing to fight for her.\r\nThe first (_a_, p. 191) is perhaps the most lovely thing Wagner\r\ninvented; the third (_d_)--not second--is a thing any one might have\r\nconcocted, though not a thing that any one I ever heard of could use\r\nas Wagner uses it; the second (_c_) is by way of being a study for the\r\nbest of the _Parsifal_ themes. It must be remarked, in passing, that\r\nthe study is much more finely used than when his powers, largely\r\nexhausted by a tedious struggle with the world, had got into a state\r\nof decrepitude.\r\n\r\nThe leitmotiv (_a_) is of a serene beauty. I must cut out of it a\r\nlittle bit (_b_) which colours the opera and gives it atmosphere from\r\nthe beginning far more than the complete theme. It is this, more than\r\nanything else, which gives _Lohengrin_ the vividness of reality\r\ncombined with the vanishing loveliness of a sweet dream. The idea of\r\nthe swan, symbolizing the broad, shining river flowing from afar-off\r\nmysterious lands to the eternal sea, is given us in this phrase, as\r\ndelicate and as firm, as unmistakable, as ever painter drew with his\r\nbrush. Here we have, not indeed Montsalvat the domain of monks, but\r\nthe land of ever-enduring dawn--a land that other poets have dreamed\r\nof, a land where hope could be subsisted on. From beginning to end\r\nLohengrin, the man on the stage, moves in the atmosphere of this\r\nstrange, dreamy, fresh and silent land: if he did not, no one would\r\ntolerate for a moment his behaviour. It is the magic charm that\r\nreconciles him to us; it is this that makes us feel how he is\r\nconditioned, chained, cribbed, cabined and confined. In obedience to\r\ninexorable law he comes down the river, drawn by the swan; in\r\nobedience to the same inexorable law he is drawn away, as helplessly\r\nas a needle drawn by a magnet.\r\n\r\nThe prelude opens with a series of chords, ascending, all on A. Handel\r\nmight have done this: none of the Viennese composers could, or perhaps\r\nI should rather say, would, have done it. Beethoven got as near to the\r\nnaked truth as ever composer did in dealing with the emotions of\r\nhumanity; Mozart, too, worked his miracles; Weber, non-Viennese\r\nthough he was, gave us weird, fantastic pictures of fairy adventures\r\nin the darkness of grim woods, but nothing more. It was left for\r\nWagner to give us in a few bars a picture, such as no painter could\r\nhave painted, of the blue heavens on an almost unimaginably fine day.\r\nThe blue sky, the thin, clear air, the sunlight, are all given us in\r\nthe first few bars. It is far from my wish to intrude my personal\r\nhistory into these pages, but I wish to give a convincing example of\r\nan episode of a sort familiar to all those who have experimented with\r\nWagner's music. A relative of mine, who had spent many of his earlier\r\nyears in travelling the southern Atlantic and the Pacific in sailing\r\nvessels, heard me play on the piano, as an illustration of some\r\nargument I was foolish enough to advance, these opening bars of the\r\n_Lohengrin_ prelude. He immediately said, \"That takes me back into the\r\nTrades\"--the sweet days of perfect peace in southern climes, where the\r\nsky was blue for day after day and week after week, where the wind\r\nsang cheerfully without change for weeks on end, where a delicious sun\r\nmade all men (no matter what the feeling was on those foul old ships)\r\nfeel good-natured and good-hearted. That is to say, my relative at\r\nonce felt the magical truthfulness of Wagner's touch: the sweet, clear\r\nair, the sunlight; and that is the atmosphere Wagner wanted to\r\nestablish at the beginning of this most magical of operas. Out of the\r\nblue sky comes the Montsalvat (not necessarily the Grail) motive; it\r\ndescends with ever-gathering fulness, through key after key, until at\r\nlast it culminates in a tremendous climax for the brass: then comes a\r\nwondrous cadence, falling slowly, as a mountain stream falls over\r\nslabs of smooth-worn mountain rock, until we get back to the original\r\natmosphere. The Montsalvat vision has faded away into the blue whence\r\nit came. Wagner afterwards achieved some marvellous things, but none\r\nmore marvellous than this.\r\n\r\nThe curtain rises: there is a rum-tum-tum by the orchestra. We are at\r\nonce in the discord of a turbulent armed camp: the fury of Telramund\r\nagainst those who are not convinced of his evidently prejudiced view\r\nthat Elsa holds the lands he wishes to hold, is made to resound in the\r\norchestra as not the most expert Italian composer could make it\r\nresound by the voices. When Elsa enters to defend herself the music\r\nchanges its character utterly; it is the embodiment of the sweetness\r\nof young feminine kindly nature; and it is odd that Wagner, when\r\nwriting this music, which he fancied was the most German ever written,\r\nshould have gone so far as, in some of its finest parts, to steal bits\r\nof the Austrian hymn, composed, as we may remember, by not even an\r\nAustrian, but a Croatian, pure Slav, composer. Elsa's account of her\r\ndream is not dramatic as Wagner, by the time he wrote his next work,\r\nwould have understood the term--in shape it is an Italian aria, and\r\neverything is at a standstill until it is finished--yet it occurs\r\nfittingly, and prepares us by ethereal music for the music of a\r\ngentleman who is very unethereal. In form the whole scene is as near\r\nas may be a regular Italian opera scene. King Henry the Fowler and his\r\nnobles show mighty patience in sitting or standing it out to the end.\r\nThe business of a champion for Elsa being called for, the moments of\r\nsuspense, the prayers of Elsa and her attendant maidens, the fiery\r\nimpatience of Telramund and the premature triumph of Ortrud are all\r\ndone with Wagner's consummate skill in writing purely theatrical\r\nmusic; and when the swan and the hero are sighted the excitement is\r\nworked up with the same skill to a glorious triumph, and we hear the\r\nLohengrin, \"as hero,\" theme in its full splendour. Then comes the\r\nfighting music, which, like all fighting music, is mediocre stuff, and\r\nthe gorgeous set piece, the finale. This last is quite old-fashioned\r\nopera, but it is not forced in: it happens inevitably. The themes are\r\nmainly new, but the Lohengrin heroic theme is worked in triumphantly.\r\nTechnically there is no advance or change in _Lohengrin_: the\r\ncounterpoint and interweaving of themes of _Tristan_ and the\r\n_Mastersingers_ were to come a few years later. Indeed, there is less\r\nof Wagner the contrapuntal virtuoso in _Lohengrin_ than in\r\n_Tannhäuser_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIn the music, as in the drama, the second act presents a total\r\ncontrast to the first. The music of the first is throughout full of\r\nsunlight. At times it may be strident, violent, rather tumultuous; but\r\nsweetness is the prevailing note, and as soon as Elsa comes on we have\r\nthe sheer loveliness of first her answers to the king, and then of\r\nher vision; then comes Lohengrin, bringing with him the breath of the\r\nland of eternal dawn, and of the shining river down which he was drawn\r\nby the swan; then after the (rather theatrical) prayer, a few moments\r\nof noise while the fighting is being arranged and carried out; then,\r\nso to speak, the glorious midday sunshine of the finale. The second\r\nact opens with two sinister phrases heard in the darkness (_e_ and\r\n_f_)--Ortrud is planning vengeance, and the theme of Lohengrin's\r\nwarning and threat to Elsa is presently heard; that warning gives her\r\nthe hint as to the way of achieving vengeance. Ortrud and Telramund,\r\noutcast, crouch there in the night; Ortrud deeply scheming, Frederick,\r\npoor dupe, madly fuming, while the lights blaze at the palace windows,\r\nand the trumpets sound out as the feast proceeds within. He rages, and\r\na theme (_f_) quoted is abruptly transformed into (_g_) as he bitterly\r\ncasts upon Ortrud the blame for their downfall. The vocal parts are\r\nneither recitative nor true song; the orchestral tide is developed in\r\nmuch the same symphonic style as in _Tannhäuser_. We are still no\r\nnearer to the perfect blending of the orchestral stream and the vocal\r\nparts that we get in _Tristan_ and in the _Mastersingers_. The style\r\nis not homogeneous: the stream is broken by theatrical exclamations\r\nand snatches of recitative that not only break the flow, but differ in\r\ncharacter from the rest. But the elasticity of motion is a great\r\nadvance on _Tannhäuser_: Wagner was coming to his own, and much of\r\n_Tannhäuser_ strikes one as cumbrous and heavy in comparison. That\r\nsinister atmosphere of mystery is never lost; the gloom and the\r\nwretched crouching figures, the fierce anger and Ortrud's alternate\r\ncajoling and threatening may be said, without exaggeration, to sound\r\nfrom the orchestra with as powerful an effect on the imagination as\r\nthe sights and sounds on the stage. Most magnificent is the descending\r\nchromatic passage that accompanies Ortrud as she casts her spell again\r\nover Frederick. It resembles closely an Erda theme of the _Ring_--as\r\nis quite natural, for one chromatic scale cannot but resemble another.\r\nThe significance of the resemblance is that the strange harmonies are\r\nalso much alike, and the central idea is the same in the two cases:\r\nthe idea of old Mother Earth, her everlasting stillness in strange\r\nplaces, her never-ceasing internal workings, her mysterious power. In\r\nthe _Ring_ there is nothing baneful in the conception: it is Nature at\r\nwork in her sleep amongst the silent hills: mysterious, indeed, but\r\ndoing no evil. Here it is the earth as conceived by the mediæval mind,\r\nthe earth to which the coming of the White Christ had banished all the\r\ngods of the older world, there to become the malevolent, malignant\r\ndivinities of the new world, and believed in as such by the first\r\nadherents of the new religion. Frederick was a Christian, mediæval\r\nstyle, and he implicitly believes that Ortrud can call up wicked\r\nspirits, and by their aid weave enchantments when the God of the East\r\nis not looking. The same may be said of the king, and indeed all the\r\ncharacters in _Lohengrin_: again I say the opera is a fairy drama in\r\nwhich these things must be assumed and accepted. That wondrous\r\npassage must have sounded doubly wonderful in the ears of two\r\ngenerations back; blent with that second sinister Ortrud theme, it\r\naccomplishes as much in a dozen or so bars as Weber could accomplish\r\nin as many pages. That Ortrud theme seems to wind round Frederick's\r\nsoul until at last he is wholly in his wife's grip; and the scene ends\r\nwith an invocation to \"ye Powers that rule our earthly lot\"--the\r\nmalignant gods of the underworld. We, knowing the kind of music Wagner\r\nhad in his mind when he wrote the libretto of _Lohengrin_, can easily\r\nunderstand Schumann's dismay when this scene was read to him: nothing\r\nof the sort had been composed before.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Elsa appears on the balcony, and the character of the music\r\nchanges at once: all now is sweetness and light. Her serenade (to\r\nherself) is a simple and very lovely thing, making full half of its\r\neffect through its contrast with the harshness, agitation and gloom of\r\nall that has gone before. There is a master-touch when Ortrud calls\r\nsoftly, \"Elsa\": by one stroke, an abrupt strange chord, the whole\r\natmosphere is for the moment altered: the dreariness of the call is\r\nunforgetable. There are many hints of Ortrud's purpose given out more\r\nand more plainly till the climax is reached in her invocation to\r\nWotan, chief of the malignant divinities. (It is strange to think that\r\nwhen he wrote this Wagner must already have had the other and more\r\ncelebrated Wotan in his thoughts.) Much of Elsa's melody is of a very\r\nWeberesque quality--and is none the worse for it: far better that than\r\nthe touches of Bellini, Marschner and Spontini that abound in the\r\nearlier operas. One or two other points may be noted. At the words\r\n\"Rest thee with me\" we get a tune which might have grown out of one\r\npreviously heard and one in the bedroom scene--not only does the tune\r\nresemble the others closely, but the rhythm of the phrases Elsa\r\naddresses to Ortrud is the same as that of the phrases with which\r\nLohengrin seems to caress Elsa. There is, of course, no \"significance\"\r\nin the sense in which the word is used by the Wagnerians. The short\r\nduet following contains a divine melody, but Ortrud's \"aside\" is a\r\nfairly lengthy one--forty bars--and is a bit of conventionalism which\r\nWagner soon discarded. The melody is played again as Elsa leads her\r\nenemy into the house; Frederick returns to curse Ortrud and Lohengrin\r\nin the same breath; all the sweetness goes out of the music as Elsa\r\ndisappears from view, and the scene closes as it opened, in gloom.\r\n\r\nAs daylight breaks Wagner indulges in one of the effects he was fond\r\nof at this period. The reveille is sounded from a turret, and an\r\nanswering call comes from a distance; and the two parties trumpet it\r\nin alternation until every one is awakened. It is a quasi-musical\r\neffect only: there is no invention: the trumpet chords serve the\r\npurpose and nothing more. He never reverted to this rather bald method\r\nof filling up time while his people are being got on the stage:\r\ncompare this passage with, for instance, Hagen's call in _The Dusk of\r\nthe Gods_. The latter is rich and full of picturesque music: it means\r\nsomething and is, in fact, an effective piece in a concert-room. Or\r\ntake the watchman with his cow-horn in the _Mastersingers_; the music\r\nis redolent of the old world; it impresses the imagination more than\r\nan entry in Pepys--\"the watchman calling two of the morning and a\r\nthick snow falling.\" In the _Lohengrin_ days his method still requires\r\nthese _longueurs_, these dry patches: later his mastery over his\r\nmaterial enabled him to deal his theatrical and his musical stroke at\r\nthe same time. As knights and retainers flock in, a long and elaborate\r\nchorus is sung--a musical, not a dramatic, chorus, almost as much in\r\nthe _Rienzi_ manner as in the manner of _Tannhäuser_. It is curious to\r\nobserve how cautious and tentative Wagner was at this stage of his\r\ngrowth. He was still groping, seeing only very dimly the destination\r\nhe would reach by the way he was taking. _Lohengrin_, had he followed\r\nthe plan he would certainly have adopted ten years later, would have\r\nbeen terser, more closely dramatic, and would have made only a short\r\nopera; there would have been fewer set numbers and a much smaller\r\nquantity of the magnificent music. The whole idea, I have already\r\nsaid, is not a dramatic one, but a musical one; and the advance on the\r\n_Dutchman_ lies in the skill with which the musical opportunities seem\r\nto grow out of the drama and are not pressed into it. In this respect\r\nit is hardly an advance on _Tannhäuser_; indeed three of the great\r\nensembles have not an adequate dramatic motive. That at the end of the\r\nfirst act, splendid music though it is, is a quite operatic finale, so\r\nconventional that only when rendered in the conventional operatic\r\nmanner does it sound and appear impressive. It becomes, when done in\r\nthis manner, a kind of dance, for towards the finish all the crowd\r\nshould form in long lines and go twining about in a ballet figure. In\r\nthis opening chorus of knights and retainers in the Second Act (scene\r\nii) the musical inspiration is intense; but words are repeated as\r\nirrationally as in a Handel oratorio chorus; and the same is the case\r\nin the bridal procession music. Wagner still had a hankering after\r\nimposing spectacle and brilliant choral writing. That bridal\r\nprocession and chorus are, of course, supremely beautiful music: music\r\nand spectacle were aimed at and achieved, not music and drama, in the\r\nlater Wagnerian sense.\r\n\r\nThe scene of the interruption of the procession first by Ortrud and\r\nthen by Frederick has always seemed to me superfluous as well as\r\nstagey. The whole thing is pure melodrama of the kind that used to be\r\npopular until a very few years ago; and the music is as melodramatic\r\nas the two incidents. The scene is far too long, and is thus rendered\r\ndoubly nonsensical. Only a few minutes before, the Herald has\r\nannounced the King's decree: any one harbouring either of the\r\noffenders \"will share his [it ought to be their] doom with life and\r\nlimb.\" Yet the offenders themselves are allowed to break up an orderly\r\nprocession and to hurl angry diatribes at the very people they have\r\nbeen banned for seeking to injure. For many minutes Ortrud, encouraged\r\nby a furious orchestra, pours forth a stream of insult directed at\r\nLohengrin and Elsa: she is not immediately seized and carried off to\r\nbe tortured: the bystanders utter a few exclamations, and leave Elsa\r\nto reply for herself. When the king and Lohengrin enter they content\r\nthemselves with gentle remonstrances: even Frederick draws from them\r\nonly dignified if somewhat scornful protests. There has been some\r\nother rather futile business: a few conspirators planning to support\r\nFrederick in attacking not only Lohengrin, but the king. The flower of\r\na loyal army look on at all this and go on their way, leaving\r\nFrederick free to make an attempt on Lohengrin's life in the third\r\nAct. Again I emphasise a point because it reveals exactly how far\r\nWagner's art had got at this period. Well might he feel it necessary,\r\nbefore proceeding to other masterpieces, to discover where he stood,\r\nwhat was his ideal, and how he might attain it. For, observe, he\r\nwanted to depict in music an imperious, ambitious, unscrupulous and\r\nwicked woman with a temper that in the end is her own undoing; he felt\r\nthe necessity of contrasting her with Elsa, sweet, gentle and\r\nlamentably weak--Elsa, who is strong, or, rather, pertinacious, only\r\nonce, and at the wrong time; and, third, he felt that his act would\r\nterminate rather tamely with a mere wedding-march. The result is this\r\nnoisy melodramatic scene, with its melodramatic music. It could not be\r\notherwise. Music cannot express anger--at best it can only suggest. By\r\nanger I mean human anger--the god's wrath of a Wotan is a different\r\nmatter. Brünnhilda knows Wotan to be angry by the raging storm that\r\nmarks his path through the heavens, by the lightnings and thunders;\r\nand we have all enough of our primitive ancestors in us to feel in\r\nsome degree as they felt--indeed, plenty of people to-day see in a\r\nstorm a manifestation of the wrath of the Almighty. Human anger has\r\nnever been put into music. Why, Ortrud alternates her rantings (mere\r\nrecitative) with beautiful phrases of the same pattern as those sung\r\nby Elsa! The music for the orchestra is turbulent rather than\r\nforcible; it is incoherent in the old-fashioned way: essentially--in\r\nspite of a free use of discords--it is as old-fashioned as anything in\r\n_Don Giovanni_. Frederick and Lohengrin have hot words, and Telramund\r\nis supposed to be a hotheaded idiot and Lohengrin a spotless, handsome\r\nhero; and lo! with due regard for the respective ranges of their\r\nvoices, they might sing each other's music and no harm done. When the\r\nchorus enters a very imposing piece of music is wrought, largely out\r\nof the Ortrud insinuating theme (_f_); but it is not dramatic music.\r\nThe ending with the resumption of the procession is one of Wagner's\r\nnoblest things. It is not in the customary sense of the phrase an\r\noperatic finale, but a perfectly satisfying piece of music that\r\nprepares us for a pause during which we can take breath before the\r\naction of the drama is taken up again in the third Act.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIn that act we have the central idea of the opera--the poetic and the\r\nmusical idea--clearly, definitely set forth--the idea of Montsalvat,\r\nfar away up the rippling river on which the white swan\r\nfloated--Montsalvat, the land of eternal dawn, where all things\r\nremained for ever young, and the flowers and the corn grew always and\r\nnever faded nor fell to the sickle. It is the land Mignon aspired\r\nto--\"Oh let me for ever then remain young\"--the impossible dream of\r\npoets and millions of men and women who were not poets: Nirvana, with\r\na difference; that realm in which, tired with the struggles and fights\r\nin the devious ways of this dark world, they should after death awake\r\nrefreshed in a serene light and pure air, thereafter to dwell for ever\r\nin a state of untroubled blessedness, where all earth's puzzles solve\r\nthemselves, and life is seen to be complete. As Senta's ballad is the\r\ngerm of the _Dutchman_, so is Lohengrin's narrative, \"In fernem Land,\"\r\nthe germ of this more beautiful opera. It plays a more important part\r\nin _Lohengrin_ than does the ballad in the _Dutchman_. Without\r\nexaggeration, the life, colour and emotion of the narrative wash\r\nbackwards and forwards over the _Lohengrin_ score, relieving scenes\r\nthat might be tedious and worrying--like those Ortrud scenes I have\r\njust described--and making the beautiful pages still more beautiful.\r\nThe land of dawn, fresh and pure, the limpid river: these, the essence\r\nof _Lohengrin_ and the pervading atmosphere, proceed from the\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\nBut much has to be got through before this point is reached. First, we\r\nhave the gorgeous prelude--the most brilliant Wagner wrote, and the\r\nlast he was to write that has no thematic connection with any portion\r\nof the opera. Here we have no summary of the act, no hint of impending\r\ndisaster and tragedy, but simply a joyous, rattling preliminary to the\r\nprocession that escorts Lohengrin and Elsa to the bridal chamber. It\r\nstarts off with immense spirit, the music leaping straight up,\r\nhesitating a moment on a cross-accent, then a noisy shake reaching its\r\nhighest note, and after a clash of the cymbals sliding off into the\r\nmore regular rhythm, broken slightly by occasional syncopations, in\r\nwhich the piece as a whole is conceived. The melody in the bass that\r\nfollows, and the more tender strains of a middle section, are familiar\r\nto every one nowadays--in fact, so familiar that we are likely to\r\noverlook the intense originality of the whole thing. When we remember\r\nthe course the drama has now to take, the tragic beauty of its close,\r\nwe can perceive how exactly right Wagner's feeling was when he left\r\nthe plan he adopted throughout the _Dutchman_ and _Tannhäuser_--the\r\nplan either of summing up or foreshadowing the ensuing scenes, or of\r\nmaking the prelude part of the first scene. Of course the music at the\r\nbeginning of Act II is rather in the nature of an introduction than of\r\na distinct prelude; but Act III is not prefaced by so much as that.\r\nRather, it suggests that since Elsa and Lohengrin entered the church\r\nall has been rejoicing, and that we catch only the tail-end of the\r\nfeast as the party comes on the stage.\r\n\r\nThe wedding chorus I pass over as rather trivial; and it contains\r\nbetween the middle section and the repetition the eight most trivial\r\nbars Wagner put to paper--I do not except the weakest portions of\r\n_Rienzi_. The opening of the great love scene--the most curious love\r\nscene in the world--is pure deliciousness. Nothing of the passion,\r\nflaming hot and terrible, of _Tristan_ is here; only a sense of sheer\r\ndelight and happiness. Melody after melody--of a very Weberesque\r\npattern, of course, but sweet, voluptuous--is poured forth; and a\r\ngraver tone comes into the music only when Elsa begins timidly to lead\r\nup to the questionings of Lohengrin which are her aim. She hints at\r\nwhat she wants, and Lohengrin gives her, to a very pretty tune, an\r\nanswer that can merely be called sublimely fatuous. Drawing her to the\r\nwindow, he bids her breathe in the odours from the flowers in the\r\nmoonlit garden beneath. \"But,\" he blandly adds, \"don't ask whence\r\ntheir sweet scent comes, or you will its wondrous charm destroy.\" The\r\nsong is, I say, a pretty one; indeed, it is so pretty that but for the\r\nenchantment of each successive phrase no one could stand the monotony\r\nof so long a series of four-bar phrases. Of that fault in _Lohengrin_\r\nI shall have more to say presently. More dramatic, living, and less\r\nmechanical stuff follows at once: Elsa is not to be put off in that\r\nway, and in agitated strains to an agitated but not spasmodic\r\naccompaniment she presses on towards disaster. Lohengrin's warning\r\nsounds out, sinister; Lohengrin pleads, always stupidly, but to music\r\nof growing intensity and grip; the measures are no longer cut to a\r\npattern, not incoherent as they are in the squabbles of the second\r\nAct; and at last a passage of Wagner at his theatrical best is\r\nreached when he solemnly warns her again--\"Greatest of trusts, Elsa, I\r\nhave shown thee.\" To another most lovely theme he tries again to\r\nsoothe her: she will not listen, and the Ortrud theme begins to writhe\r\nin the orchestra, and we know that Elsa's soul is fast bound in the\r\nspell of suspicion which Ortrud put upon her. She gets nearer and\r\nnearer to the fatal question, and suddenly in the impotent rage of a\r\nfretful woman who cannot get her way--a woman driven mad by baseless\r\njealousy--in fancy she sees the swan coming to lead Lohengrin away\r\nfrom her; with mournful and dreary effect a fragment of the swan theme\r\nsounds from the orchestra. This simple touch is weird to a degree\r\nnever dreamed of by all the purveyors of operatic horrors; it is\r\nunearthly, uncanny, in its wild beauty. The climax is immensely\r\npowerful, but very simple, and, above all, sheer art of the theatre.\r\nThere is a crash as Frederick rushes in to be instantly killed; a bass\r\npassage tears down the scale to the depths; and the horns sustain two\r\npianissimo chords, two notes in each; then silence, broken only by\r\nsoft drum-beats to make the silence felt. Elsa has fainted, and as she\r\nrevives we hear a bit of the duet--Lohengrin's tenderness as he tends\r\nher, and a fleeting dream of Elsa's, perhaps, seem to blend in it. All\r\nis finished.\r\n\r\nTo compare this duet with that in _Tristan_ would be profitless but\r\nfor one reason. Wagner had not yet reached that perfect mastery of his\r\nart which enabled him, so to speak, to fuse the dramatic and the\r\nmusical inspiration. We saw how in the _Dutchman_ the music rose to\r\nits full height and splendour when the drama was sincere and true; in\r\n_Tristan_ drama and music are inseparable. In _Lohengrin_, where the\r\ninspiration is, if not wholly, at any rate mainly, musical, the drama\r\nseems at times to be somewhat of a hindrance. I have mentioned the\r\nfine dramatic or stage touches; but the finest things occur when the\r\npair, singly or together, are singing music that would be as effective\r\non a concert platform as on the stage. The art, that is, is far away\r\nfrom the art of the _Tristan_ duet. At many points the situation is\r\nsaved by Wagner's stage dexterity: only when the music is almost as\r\ncompletely self-moulded as in a symphony, or any other form of\r\n\"absolute\" music, is it at its best. For practical purposes with\r\nWagner the songs are \"absolute\" music: the words were his own, and he\r\ncould alter them to suit the musical exigency.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe opening of the next scene is spectacular, and the music is not\r\nstriking--for Wagner, though Marschner or Spontini might have owned it\r\nwith pride. The entry of the nobles bringing Frederick's corpse, the\r\nentry also of Elsa, \"like Niobe, all tears,\" are theatrically\r\npowerful. Elsa's entry is a particularly beautiful example of what I\r\nhave previously called Wagner's dramatict use of the leitmotiv. There\r\nare twenty bars of accompaniment, and in that space we have three\r\nmotives, so arranged that those who knew their significance, but had\r\nnever seen the earlier portions of the opera, might easily read the\r\nwhole of Elsa's sad history. As she is led in, stricken down and\r\nmiserable, the warning theme is heard; then that winding, insidious\r\ntheme associated with Ortrud; and last, four bars of the music heard\r\nin the first act when she stands helpless before the king and has\r\nnothing wherewith to answer her accusers: she is as miserable now as\r\nshe was then, and the cause of it Lohengrin's edict and her defiance\r\nof it under Ortrud's influence. The device I have always maintained to\r\nbe a naïve one; but it may be used to a sublime end, as in the _Dusk\r\nof the Gods_ funeral procession, or as here, to emphasize Elsa's\r\nsituation, and to remind us at once of her being the authoress of her\r\nown destruction. This is followed by acclamations as Lohengrin enters,\r\nand nothing further of note occurs until he declares that, for reasons\r\nwhich he cannot give, he will not go forth to fight the foe with the\r\nBrabantians; and this declaration is set to the same passage, or part\r\nof it, in which he has lately warned Elsa not to question him (p.\r\n175). The meaning of the words and the dramatic significance of this\r\nmusical phrase are beyond my understanding. If Lohengrin did not mean\r\nto tell his secret the musical phrase might imply that he had no\r\nintention of letting them ask for it. But he has come there with no\r\nother intention than that of revealing everything--and, in a word, the\r\nwhole business is incomprehensible because there is nothing to be\r\ncomprehended--because it is sheer nonsense. How Wagner, even supposing\r\nhe had originally some other idea for the ending of the work, could\r\nlet so flat a contradiction of his final plan stand--this also is\r\nmore than I can understand; for in later years he saw his opera\r\nperformed. And at that I must leave the matter. Lohengrin presently\r\nproceeds to disclose his secret in that wondrous \"In fernem\r\nLand\"--surely the most superb thing of its sort ever written. The\r\nvocal part is--as I have already pointed out, this is often the case\r\nin Wagner--something between pure song and recitative; and here it is\r\nof a quality he himself rarely matched--not even in _Tristan_.\r\nTechnically, it is a piece of descriptive music for instruments; but\r\nthe words which give it significance and point are set to phrases\r\nthemselves so beautiful, pathetic and inevitable that one feels that\r\nthe vocal part and the orchestral were begotten simultaneously in that\r\nmarvellous brain. In other chapters I will point to passages,\r\nespecially in the _Ring_, where quite obviously the voice part has\r\nbeen laboriously worked in with instrumental music already conceived\r\nin its final form; but that was in Wagner's later years, when the free\r\ninspiration, enthusiasm and energy of his _Tristan_ and _Lohengrin_\r\nand _Mastersingers_ days had for ever departed. There is an accent of\r\npassionate grief in Lohengrin's words to Elsa, and of remorse in\r\nElsa's wailings; but the most touching thing in this final scene is\r\nthe song in which he hands her his sword, horn and ring, to be given\r\nto her brother should he return. The note of regret, especially in the\r\npoignant \"leb' wohl,\" reminds one irresistibly of Wotan's farewell to\r\nBrünnhilda. The latter is broader, richer, vaster,--and yet the tender\r\nsimplicity of this is inexpressibly touching. After that the opera\r\nproceeds to its conclusion in what one may call a normal manner: there\r\nis nothing, anyhow, in the music that requires analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n_Lohengrin_ cannot be called Wagner's greatest achievement, but it is\r\na \"fine,\" if not a \"first careless rapture\" whose freshness he never\r\nquite recaptured. Yet, in a way, it is the most mannered of his works.\r\nI know of no opera where one phrase, one harmony or set of harmonies,\r\nor one violin figure is made to serve so many and such widely\r\ndifferent purposes; and not since the early seventeen hundreds had the\r\nperfect cadence been so hard worked. Only two numbers are in other\r\nthan four-four time--the prayer and the wedding song. The melodies on\r\npage upon page consist of regular four-bar lengths, commonly\r\nterminating in a full close. We can admit all this--indeed, we must\r\nadmit it all--and then we are only bound the more to admire the vast\r\namount of variety Wagner got in spite of all the obstacles self-placed\r\nin his way. His fondness for the diminished seventh, constantly\r\nexploited throughout, was perhaps a fondness for his own adopted\r\nchild--for no one had ever properly employed it before: to him and to\r\nevery one at the time his use of it was new. Many points in his\r\nprolonged passages which are simply arpeggios of the chord of the\r\ndiminished seventh must have seemed novel in the eighteen-forties,\r\nthough we hardly notice them now. The four-bar lengths send the\r\nmusic along with a swing very different from the jerkiness of\r\ncontemporary opera music. The cadence is used only to attain, so to\r\nspeak, a fresh jumping-off place: there is no moment of real rest:\r\nsimultaneously with the attainment of a point of rest the new impulse\r\nis felt, and away the thing flies again. But what compensates for all\r\nthese defects--and defects they are--is the perpetual presence of the\r\nMontsalvat music: we are never long without hearing some of it. The\r\nMontsalvat music is the source of the charm and fascination of the\r\nopera, and its purity and freshness seem likely for ever to keep the\r\nopera sweet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nEXILE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe journey to Zurich was a risky one. Wagner, the composer of what is\r\nnow the most popular of all operas, _Lohengrin_, might indeed pass\r\nunnoticed, for the work had not been heard; but the composer of the\r\n_Dutchman_ and of _Rienzi_, and perhaps of _Tannhäuser_, and above all\r\nthe organizer and conductor of the largest musical festival ever held\r\nin Dresden, could not easily slip past unobserved. As a matter of\r\nfact, few or none of the officials seemed very anxious to catch him;\r\nstill, thousands of innocent persons were being taken by the\r\nPrussians, \"tried,\" and sent to long terms of penal servitude for\r\nhaving done nothing--it being argued, apparently, that any one against\r\nwhom nothing could be proved must of necessity be guilty of some\r\ncrime. Wagner's first idea was simply to keep out of the way until\r\nthings had quieted down. It took things more than a couple of years to\r\nquiet down. Meantime a warrant was out for Richard's arrest. His\r\nmovements between Dresden, Chemnitz and Freiberg are of no interest\r\nnowadays; but things became a little exciting from the day, May 13\r\n(1849), when he arrived at Liszt's. I have related how for a week or\r\nso all seemed well, and Wagner thought himself safe, being out of\r\nSaxony. He even intended witnessing a representation of _Tannhäuser_,\r\nbut the day before, if not sooner, the warrant was circulated in the\r\nGerman fashion of those days, with a personal description which seems\r\nto have been made purposely vague by some friendly hand, though more\r\nnaturally one would assume it to be due to official stupidity. Wagner\r\nheard Liszt rehearsing something of his and was overjoyed, and also he\r\nwas so confident of his own security that he still wanted to stay to\r\nhear _Tannhäuser_. Liszt would not hear of it; he packed his friend\r\noff under an assumed name to some other friends; they procured a\r\npassport, and he travelled to Zurich via Jena and Coburg. It should be\r\nput on record that in the meantime he ran the risk of being captured\r\nby lingering to have a last hour with his wife. Towards the end of the\r\nmonth he reached Zurich, and had no more fear of the Prussian police.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen how sick he had grown of Dresden, where he\r\ncomplained of being slowly stifled; but Liszt proposed--nay,\r\ninsisted--on something worse than Dresden--Paris. Wagner was now a\r\npenniless, homeless wanderer, as he had been when he set out from Riga\r\nten years before; and Liszt fondly believed that only by making a hit\r\nin Paris could he command any enduring success in Germany, and thus\r\ngain money to live on, wherever he might happen to be. Liszt was the\r\ngood genie who found the funds, and Wagner, having nothing better to\r\npropose, was bound to obey. So he stayed three days in Zurich and set\r\nout; and a deal of good he did! He knew absolutely that such work as\r\nhis could scarcely hope to get so much as a bare hearing, and the\r\nevent proved him to be right. He submitted scenarios of several operas\r\nto a French poet, and there, for all practical purposes, the business\r\nended. Here is a fragment from a letter to Theodor Uhlig, dated\r\nZurich, August 9, '49--\r\n\r\n    \"I am living here, helped in communistic fashion by Liszt, in\r\n    good spirits, and I may say prosperously, according to my best\r\n    nature; my only and great anxiety is about my poor wife, whom I\r\n    am expecting here very shortly. To my very great astonishment, I\r\n    find that I am a celebrity here; made so, indeed, by means of\r\n    the piano scores of all my operas, out of which whole acts are\r\n    repeatedly performed at concerts and at choral unions. At the\r\n    beginning of the winter I shall go again to Paris to have\r\n    something performed and to put my opera matter into order. You\r\n    cannot imagine what joy one finds in frugality if one knows that\r\n    thereby the noblest thing, freedom, is assured; you know how\r\n    long I was brewing in my blood the Dresden catastrophe, only I\r\n    had no presentiment of the exact hurricane which would drive me\r\n    thence; but you are thoroughly convinced that all the annuities\r\n    and restitutions in the world would not induce me to become\r\n    again what, to my greatest sorrow, I was in Dresden. I have just\r\n    a last remnant of curiosity, however, and you would give me much\r\n    pleasure in letting me know how matters stand with you. My wife\r\n    has never found leisure to give me news of Dresden, the\r\n    theatre, and the band. Do relieve this last Dresden longing. Do\r\n    you happen to know anything definite about the state of the\r\n    police inquiry? The fate of Heubner, Roeckel and Bakunin\r\n    troubles me much. Anyhow, these persons ought not to be\r\n    imprisoned. But don't let me speak of it! In this matter one can\r\n    only judge justly and adequately if one looks at the period from\r\n    a lofty point of view. Woe to him who acts with sublime purpose,\r\n    and then, for his deeds, is judged by the police! It is a grief\r\n    and a shame which only our times can show.\"\r\n\r\nHe had no real intention of returning to Paris. Earlier in the same\r\nletter he speaks of ending the speculating by his proposed _Jesus of\r\nNazareth_. Indeed, the slavery of working for the market in Paris was\r\neven more repugnant to him than the liveried bondage in Saxony.\r\nPrevious to the writing of this letter Liszt had lent him twelve\r\npounds, and by the end of July he was back in Zurich, and though, much\r\nagainst his will, he did go to Paris again, and, in fact, much\r\nfarther, Zurich was thenceforth for some years his headquarters. His\r\nhost at first was an honest musician Alexander Müller, who, I believe,\r\nhad known him in Würzburg long before; but he soon set up an\r\nestablishment of his own.\r\n\r\nHis main purpose at this time was to try to clear in his brain the\r\nconfused mass of theories and speculations concerning music, and\r\nespecially opera, which had long been seething there. _Lohengrin_, the\r\nreader must have observed, was not a road leading anywhere, but an\r\nimpasse; a step towards the attainment of his ideal it was not: it\r\nwas, on the whole, a step backwards, although it is a much more\r\nbeautiful work than _Tannhäuser_. Wagner's mind, like Thoreau's,\r\nCarlyle's, Brahms', needed filtering--an operation that could only be\r\nperformed in perfect peace and loneliness. Thoreau went to Walden;\r\nCarlyle to Craigenputtock; Brahms at any rate retired from public\r\nmusical life. They worked out their own salvation. Wagner felt he must\r\ndo the same; as we know, he did the same: hence many of those terrible\r\nvolumes of prose-writings. His mental condition is indicated in\r\nanother few sentences from the letter quoted above--\r\n\r\n    \"Yet I must frankly confess that the freedom which I here inhale\r\n    in fresh Alpine draughts is intensely pleasing to me. What is\r\n    the ordinary care about the so-called future of citizen life\r\n    compared with the feeling that we are not tyrannized over in our\r\n    noblest aims? How few men care more for themselves than for\r\n    their stomachs? Now I have made my choice, and am spared the\r\n    trouble of choosing; so I feel free in my innermost soul, and\r\n    can despise what torments me from without; no one can withdraw\r\n    himself from the evil influences of the civilized barbarism of\r\n    our time, but all can so manage that they do not rule over our\r\n    better self.\"\r\n\r\nWe may as well note one point at once. When Thoreau, Carlyle and\r\nBrahms went into their respective wildernesses, they maintained\r\nthemselves, as they thought merely proper. In this respect Wagner's\r\nviews did not coincide with theirs. He exclaims scornfully, \"How few\r\nmen care more for themselves than for their stomachs!\" What he meant\r\nwas that he should care for himself while his friends cared for his\r\nstomach. As he cared a very great deal for his stomach, his demands\r\nupon his friends were exorbitant and continuous. True, he offered the\r\nfruits of his brain to the world at large, but all save the faithful\r\nliked not the security. The creator of _Lohengrin_ and _Tannhäuser_\r\nwas quite justified in believing that he _ought_ to be supported, and\r\nit may be that the respect we pay to the artists who starve it out is\r\nonly a complacent way of saying how pleased we are that no one asks us\r\nto put our hands in our pockets. Nevertheless--!\r\n\r\nWe must remember, however, that he had no money and no prospects, and\r\ncarried the burden of gigantic unfinished, un-begun projects; his\r\nworldly situation was even more desperate than it had been in 1839.\r\nThe voyage from Pillau was a voyage into the unknown, undertaken in\r\nthe hope of securing something tangible--a performance of _Rienzi_ and\r\nfame and money; the voyage on which he had set out was into an even\r\nstranger unknown, a voyage into the world of ideas, without any\r\nprospects whatever in the worldly sense. He was groping his way\r\nconfusedly towards something greater than he had hitherto\r\naccomplished; but he knew neither what subject to select nor how to\r\ntreat it. Nature had laid this burden upon him: he took it up only\r\nbecause he must; and, luckily for us, the giver of the burden had\r\ngranted him the arrogance, the courage, the imperviousness to the\r\nestimation in which he might be held by others--if the reader likes it\r\nbetter, the sheer cheek--to find the means of living while he carried\r\nthe burden to the appointed place and so achieved his end. When John\r\nthe Baptist went into the wilderness he found camel's hair to clothe\r\nhimself and wild honey to feed himself. Even these primitive luxuries\r\nare not to be had for looking in modern Europe, and Wagner asked his\r\nfriends to supply a substitute for them.\r\n\r\nWe find him suggesting to Liszt that a number of German princes might\r\ncombine to support him, and in return accept his works as he turned\r\nthem out; he suggested also that Liszt might himself guarantee him an\r\nannuity. Liszt was from the beginning, and continued until the\r\nappearance of King Ludwig in 1864, to be the most generous of helpers,\r\nbut he had ceased to go concertizing through Europe, and had not too\r\nmuch money to spare. The Wesendoncks, Ritters, Wagner's own family,\r\nall contributed as they could; but verily the man seemed to be a\r\nbottomless abyss into which all the wealth of the world might be\r\ndropped and still it would gape for more. If all his admirers in 1850\r\nhad contributed a penny a month he might have been satisfied--if half\r\nthe number of his admirers in 1913 could have contributed a penny a\r\nyear he would have had more than even he could have spent. But no such\r\nplan seemed to be feasible; and on Liszt fell the brunt, whilst the\r\nothers did what they could or thought fit to do. Wagner may\r\nreasonably be defended against the charge of greed or luxury. He was\r\nin chronic ill-health, and his stupendous exertions made it unlikely\r\nhe would ever be better. We can believe even Praeger when he tells us\r\nthat Wagner's skin was so sensitive that he could tolerate only the\r\nfinest silk next to it; for we know that from babyhood he was tortured\r\nby eczema. Had he not coddled himself he would not have had the\r\nstrength and nerve to achieve anything at all. He never knew one day\r\nwhere next day's food was to come from; he was a homeless exile.\r\nHappiness he never knew: such men as Wagner are not created to be\r\nhappy. Publishers and opera-directors alike treated him scurvily. To\r\nshow his state of mind I quote a portion of another letter to Uhlig,\r\ndated September, 1850, after the production of _Lohengrin_ at Weimar--\r\n\r\n    \"Liszt spoke to me previously about an honorarium of thirty\r\n    louis d'or for _Lohengrin_--instead of which I had altogether\r\n    only 130 thalers. Further, he announced to me that I should\r\n    receive a commission to write _Siegfried_ for Weimar, and be\r\n    paid beforehand enough to keep me alive undisturbed until the\r\n    work was finished. Until now they preserve there the most\r\n    stubborn silence. Whether I should give _Siegfried_ to Weimar,\r\n    intending it to be produced there, is after all a question\r\n    which, as matters now stand, I would probably only answer with\r\n    an unqualified No! I need not begin to assure you that I really\r\n    abandoned _Lohengrin_ when I permitted its production at\r\n    Weimar. I certainly received a letter yesterday from Zigesar,\r\n    which informed me that the second performance--given, through\r\n    somewhat energetic remonstrance on my part, only after most\r\n    careful rehearsals, and without cuts--was a wonder of success\r\n    and of effect on the public, and that it was perfectly clear\r\n    that it was and would remain a \"draw\". Yet I need not give you\r\n    my further reasons when I declare that I should wish to send\r\n    _Siegfried_ into the world in different fashion from that which\r\n    would be possible to the good people there. With regard to this,\r\n    I am busy with wishes and plans which, at first look, seem\r\n    chimerical, yet these alone give me the heart to finish\r\n    _Siegfried_. To realize the best, the most decisive, the most\r\n    important work which, under the present circumstances, I can\r\n    produce--in short, the accomplishment of the conscious mission\r\n    of my life--needs a matter of perhaps 10,000 thalers. If I could\r\n    ever command such a sum I would arrange thus:--here, where I\r\n    happen to be, and where many a thing is far from bad--I would\r\n    erect, after my own plans, in a beautiful field, near the town,\r\n    a rough theatre of planks and beams, and merely furnish it with\r\n    the decorations and machinery necessary for the production of\r\n    _Siegfried_. Then I would select the best singers to be found\r\n    anywhere, and invite them for six weeks to Zurich. I would try\r\n    to form a chorus here, consisting, for the most part, of\r\n    amateurs; there are splendid voices here, and strong, healthy\r\n    people. I should invite in the same way my orchestra. At the new\r\n    year announcements and invitations to all the friends of the\r\n    musical drama would appear in all the German newspapers, with a\r\n    call to visit the proposed dramatic musical festival. Any one\r\n    giving notice, and travelling for this purpose to Zurich, would\r\n    receive a certain entrée--naturally, like all the entrées,\r\n    gratis. Besides, I should invite to a performance the young\r\n    people here, the university, the choral unions. When everything\r\n    was in order I should arrange, under these circumstances, for\r\n    three performances of _Siegfried_ in one week. After the third\r\n    the theatre would be pulled down, and my score burnt. To those\r\n    persons who had been pleased with the thing I should then say,\r\n    'Now do likewise.' But if they wanted to hear something new from\r\n    me, I should say, 'You get the money.' Well, do I seem quite mad\r\n    to you? It may be so, but I assure you to attain this end is the\r\n    hope of my life, the prospect which alone can tempt me to take\r\n    in hand a work of art. So--get me 10,000 thalers--that's all!\"\r\n\r\nHis friends, I say, did their best; but Liszt, though his generosity\r\nhad no bounds, still clung to the odd idea that Wagner should do\r\nsomething for himself; also he could not get it out of his head that\r\nthe something could only be done in Paris. So, in another of the Uhlig\r\nletters, dated more than six months anterior to the above, we find him\r\nwriting, half wearily, half defiantly--\r\n\r\n    \"I have never felt the consciousness of freedom so beneficent\r\n    as now, nor have I ever been so convinced that only a loving\r\n    communion with others procures freedom. If, through the\r\n    assistance of X., I should be enabled to look firmly at the\r\n    immediate future without any necessity to earn a living, those\r\n    years would be the most decisive of my life, and especially of\r\n    my artistic career; for now I could look at Paris with calmness\r\n    and dignity; whereas, before, the fear of being compelled by\r\n    outward necessity to make concessions, made every step which I\r\n    took for Paris a false one. Now it would stand otherwise.\r\n    Formerly it was thus: 'Disown thyself, become another, become\r\n    Parisian in order to win for yourself Paris.' Now I would say:\r\n    'Remain just as thou art, show to the Parisians what thou art\r\n    willing and able to produce from within, give them an idea of\r\n    it, and in order that they may comprehend thee, speak to them so\r\n    that they may understand thee; for thy aim is just this--to be\r\n    understood by them as that which thou art,' I hope you agree\r\n    with this.\r\n\r\n    \"So on January 16, 1850, I go to Paris; a couple of overtures\r\n    will at once be put into practice; and I shall take my completed\r\n    opera scheme: it is _Wiland der Schmied_. First of all I attack\r\n    the five-act opera form, then the statute according to which in\r\n    every great opera there must be a special ballet. If I can only\r\n    inspire Gustave Vaez, and impart to him the understanding of my\r\n    intention, and the will to carry it through with me, well and\r\n    good, if not, I'll seek till I find the right poet. For every\r\n    difficulty standing in the way of the understanding I, and the\r\n    subject connected with me, are attacked by the Press; if it is\r\n    a question of clearing away without mercy the whole rubbish and\r\n    cleansing with fresh water--in that matter I am in my right\r\n    element, for my aim is to create revolution whithersoever I\r\n    come. If I succumb--well the defeat is more honourable than a\r\n    triumph in the opposite direction; even without personal victory\r\n    I am, in any case, useful to the cause. In this matter victory\r\n    will only be really assured by endurance; who holds out wins\r\n    absolutely; and holding out with me means--for I am in no way in\r\n    doubt about my force of will--to have enough money to strike\r\n    hard and without intermission and not to worry about my own\r\n    means of living. If I have enough money, I must at once see\r\n    about getting my pamphlet on art translated and circulated.\r\n    Well, that will be seen when I am on the spot, and I shall\r\n    decide according to the means at my disposal. If my money comes\r\n    to an end too soon, I confidently hope for help from another\r\n    quarter--_i.e._ from the social republic, which sooner or later\r\n    must inevitably be established in France. If it comes\r\n    about--well, here I am ready for it, and, in the matter of art,\r\n    I have solidly prepared the way for it. It will not happen\r\n    exactly as my good-natured friends wish, according to their\r\n    predilection for the evil present time, but quite otherwise,\r\n    and, with good fortune, in a far better way--for, as they wish,\r\n    I only serve myself--but as I wish to serve all.\"\r\n\r\nThe history of this third Paris episode is distressing enough; but we\r\nto-day, knowing what Paris was and what Wagner was, need not trouble\r\nmuch about it. I have passed over it quickly; but yet another excerpt\r\nfrom an Uhlig letter may be given to show how matters did _not_\r\nprogress (dated Paris, March 13, 1850)--\r\n\r\n    \"So, my Parisian art-wallowings are given up since I recognized\r\n    their profane character. Heavens, how Fischer will rejoice when\r\n    he hears I have become a man of order! Everything strengthened\r\n    me in my ardent desire for renunciation. After endless waiting,\r\n    I at last receive the orchestral parts of my _Tannhäuser_\r\n    overture, and pay with pleasure fifteen francs carriage for\r\n    them. I then find that the parts have arrived much too soon, for\r\n    the Union Musicale has time for everything except for the\r\n    rehearsal of my overtures. I am, however, told that there may be\r\n    rehearsals at the end of this month, and actually under a\r\n    conductor who, in all the performances given under his\r\n    direction, carries out the happy idea of indicating _tempi,\r\n    nuances_, style in a manner quite different from that intended\r\n    by the composer; and with passionate conscientiousness, insists\r\n    on studying and conducting himself without ever allowing the\r\n    composer to expound his confused views about his own work.\r\n    Rocked in blissful dreams, I receive at last a letter of\r\n    Heine's, with an enclosure from Wigand--namely, a money-order\r\n    for ten louis d'or, which, from your letter, I had unfortunately\r\n    expected would come to twenty louis d'or.\r\n\r\n    \"In short, early to-morrow morning (at eight o'clock) I start\r\n    off with the intention of being back here at the end of the\r\n    month, for the possible rehearsals of my overture.\r\n\r\n    \"I am sorry for Heine and Fischer. Poor fellows! they picture me\r\n    floating along on a sea of Parisian hopes; they will be greatly\r\n    and painfully undeceived. Salute and console them. When my\r\n    cursed ill-humour of to-day has passed away, I will write to\r\n    Heine. To his fidelity must I present an earnest face. A\r\n    thousand greetings to my dear R----s, from whom I should so\r\n    much have liked to receive a line. The merchant M----, of\r\n    Dresden, will bring you something from me when he returns from\r\n    his great Parisian business trip; a good daguerreotype copy from\r\n    an excellent portrait which my friend Rietz has taken of me\r\n    here.\r\n\r\n    \"What more shall I write? I am all confusion about my hasty\r\n    departure. I have now only to write the verses to my _Wiland_;\r\n    otherwise the whole poem is finished--German, German! How my pen\r\n    flew along! This _Wiland_ will carry you all away on its wings;\r\n    even your friendly Parisian hopes. If K---- does not write soon,\r\n    I shall presume that he is raving too madly about Krebs. Krebs\r\n    is clever--so is Michalesi--what more do you want? But K----\r\n    should restrain himself, and not give himself away so much as he\r\n    does, as with me!\r\n\r\n    \"Farewell! Another time you will receive a more sensible letter,\r\n    with a list of misprints in my last book. If people do not\r\n    comprehend me even after this work, if I am charged with\r\n    improprieties, I clearly see the reason; one cannot understand\r\n    my writings for the misprints. To my joy some one is playing\r\n    the piano overhead; but no melody, only accompaniment, which has\r\n    a charm for me, in that I can practice myself in the art of\r\n    finding  melodies\"--\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, these few bitter lines, sent after his return to\r\nZurich--\r\n\r\n    \"It is impossible for me to conduct my overture myself in Paris,\r\n    for this reason, that it will not be performed there at all, as\r\n    there was not proper time for rehearsal--perhaps \"next year\". I\r\n    received this answer on the eve of my departure from Paris, and\r\n    truly in a very pleasant quarter. I think I never laughed so\r\n    loud and so from the bottom of my heart as on that evening and\r\n    in that place.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that Wagner never ceased to work during all this\r\ndreary time. He drafted his _Wieland the Smith_, made tentative shots\r\nat what at length grew into the _Nibelung's Ring_, and poured forth an\r\nenormous quantity of very prosy prose. Deferring a consideration of\r\nthis last, let me tell briefly what his everyday life was. Through a\r\nlittle money from pamphlets, performing fees, etc., but mainly through\r\nthe generosity of friends, he managed to live; though, as I have said,\r\nhe never was quite sure about his next meal, a raven always flew in\r\nfrom somewhere just in the nick of time. Minna came, and her sister,\r\nand his home was made comfortable for him; he had many friends; he\r\nrapidly became recognized as many a cubit taller than any other\r\nmusician in the parish. The opera and some orchestral concerts were\r\nplaced under his direction; and Hans von Bülow came to serve his\r\napprenticeship as conductor under him, very largely at the theatre.\r\nWagner mentions a performance of the _Flying Dutchman_, which afforded\r\nhim pleasure; for though, as he himself says somewhere, the band\r\nconsisted of players more accustomed to play at dances than in grand\r\nopera, and not a singer of celebrity took part, yet all were\r\npainstaking, enthusiastic and sympathetic, and a fine representation\r\nwas the result. This was the work he did outside his own house; his\r\ninside occupations I have mentioned. He lived with almost clockwork\r\npunctuality. Every afternoon he walked, accompanied by his dog,\r\namongst the mountains, and to these walks may be attributed, I think,\r\nthe atmosphere and colour of the _Ring_ and its backgrounds. Wagner\r\nwas as great a master as has lived of pictorial music, and the hills\r\nand ravines, the storms amongst the pines, were things he must have\r\ncraved to translate into terms of his own art. After all, he found\r\ntime also for a good deal of social intercourse, though the enormous\r\nquantity of work he turned out makes this difficult to believe. But\r\nLiszt visited him; Praeger undoubtedly did; Bülow, as said, was with\r\nhim for some time; the Wesendoncks, his greatest pecuniary benefactors\r\nafter a while, were there; Wille and his wife were there; Alexander\r\nRitter, son of Frau Ritter, who made Wagner a regular allowance from\r\n1851 to 1856, became his firm friend, and afterwards married one of\r\nhis nieces; there were Baumgärtner and Sulzer--in fact, a bare list of\r\nnames would fill a few pages. We must not take Wagner's plaints in his\r\nletters too seriously; he was an overworked, nervous man of moods;\r\nlike Mr. Micawber, he seems to have come home of an evening weeping\r\nand declaring himself a ruined man, and in a few hours gone to bed\r\ncalculating the cost of throwing out bow windows to his house.\r\nThroughout his life his resilience of spirit was one of his most\r\namazing characteristics: I have no doubt that in the depth of despair\r\nhe would write to Liszt swearing that he only wanted solitude; and in\r\nan hour's time he would think it might be pleasant to spend an hour\r\nwith the Wesendoncks--and go. In the same way he longed earnestly for\r\ndeath while spending all his friends' money on baths and cures and\r\ndoctors, and seeing to it that Minna provided the best of everything\r\nfor his table. The pile of work remains to show his life was one of\r\nincredible industry. Between the end of 1848 and the end of 1854 he\r\nwrote at least a dozen long pamphlets, and as many more that are not\r\nso long; he wrote the words of the _Ring_ and composed and scored the\r\n_Rhinegold_, and began the music of the _Valkyrie_. Further, he\r\nrevised the overture to Gluck's _Iphigenia in Aulis_, and\r\nreconstructed his own _Faust_ overture. How on earth he managed his\r\ninterminable correspondence is more than I can guess. When we bear in\r\nmind the calls upon his time by his superintendence of opera and\r\nconcerts, we cannot wonder that a man who did so much, and was born a\r\nweakling, was rarely quite well, and incessantly complains of his\r\nnerves. Yet these nerves, he wrote, gave him wonderful hours of\r\ninsight.\r\n\r\nThere remains one thing to mention of these first Zurich years: his\r\noperas were gradually spreading through Germany, and, especially,\r\nLiszt had produced _Lohengrin_ at Weimar in 1850. It quickly became so\r\npopular that before long Wagner could complain, or boast, that he was\r\nthe only German who had not heard it. His movements during these years\r\ncan easily be traced. Zurich remained his headquarters, but he went\r\nhither and thither, mainly in search of health. But the chief cause of\r\nhis ill-health he carried with him--his irrepressible activity of\r\nmind. Could some intelligent doctor have given him a dose to stop him\r\nthinking for not less than one month, he would, I verily believe, have\r\nenjoyed ten years of unbroken freedom from sickness. These flittings\r\nare of no great interest in themselves; he never got far until his\r\nfamous expedition to London in the summer of 1855. But now it is time\r\nto take a glance at the writings of the period.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIn the introduction I announced my intention of dealing with Wagner's\r\nprose-writings only in so far as they reveal anything of value\r\nconcerning the artist. His theories have been explained and elucidated\r\nto death; hundreds of books have been written about them; never was a\r\nman so much explained; never did a man suffer more from the\r\nexplanations. The day when Wagner began, not to theorise, but to\r\npublish his theorisings, was an unlucky one for him. He began with the\r\nintention, and certainly in the hope, of making himself clear to\r\nhimself; as I have already remarked, he wanted to find what it was he\r\nwanted to be at and how to get there; and if, having achieved his end,\r\nhe had put all his pages of reasoning in the fire, he would have done\r\nhimself no ill-service. But he needed money, and in the 'forties and\r\n'fifties there were, strangely enough, numbers of people who would pay\r\nmoney for such stuff. Anything dull, \"philosophic\" in tone, anything\r\nfull of long words, longer sentences, and meanings too profound to be\r\nunderstood by mortal--anything of this sort was sure of a paying\r\naudience, if small, in \"philosophic\" Germany, no matter how fallacious\r\nwere the premises, how wrong the history, how perverse the inferences.\r\nHundreds of people must have risen from reading Wagner's essays\r\nfeeling themselves very deeply intellectual. In his first Paris days\r\nWagner had at once flown to his prose-scribbling pen as an instrument\r\nto procure him bread; now, in Zurich, while writing and arguing mainly\r\nto free his own soul, he had an eye on the publisher and the public,\r\nfor he needed bread as much as ever he had needed it; and he needed\r\nother things besides: all the luxuries he had grown accustomed to and\r\ncould have done without ten years earlier. He persuaded himself of the\r\nvalidity of another reason why he should unload his prose-wares on the\r\nworld. He had written much at times in various papers with a\r\nwholehearted wish to purify and advance art. Now he determined to be\r\nhimself John the Baptist walking, in defiance of the laws of nature,\r\nmiles in front of himself in the wilderness, crying out that he who\r\nwas to redeem German music and the German folk was coming. He actually\r\npersuaded himself, I say, that by reading these lucubrations German\r\naudiences would prepare themselves to understand his works--as yet in\r\nprocess of incubation--at a first hearing! Fools we are, and slight;\r\nbut surely no man was ever a bigger fool than our poor Richard when he\r\nthought that a great work of art could possibly or should be\r\nunderstood at the first glance, and that the feat would be easy if\r\nonly one had read some theories of art beforehand. The contrary holds\r\ntrue: if you have seen and felt Wagner's operas, you may understand\r\nwhat he is talking about in his articles and pamphlets; but to read\r\nthese first is merely to bewilder yourself utterly when you go to see\r\nthe operas. I will dismiss, therefore, much of the prose with very\r\nbrief notice, and some of it without any notice at all. It may be\r\nremarked that of all the commentaries I have waded through (and been\r\nwell-nigh choked with), on the prose, there is, to my mind, only one\r\nworth reading, Mr. Ernest Newman's valuable _Study of Wagner_.\r\n\r\nThe French stories and articles are as good as anything Wagner wrote.\r\nHe had not yet fallen into the villainous German philosophic style, or\r\nwas restrained by the consciousness that he must write in a lingo that\r\ncould be translated into French. These pieces were written for bread\r\nand bread alone in the terrible years of starvation, 1840-41. _An\r\nEnd_ [of a German Musician] _in Paris_ is full of autobiography, and\r\nintensely interesting on that account; it is interesting, too, because\r\nof its display of the naïve arrogance which leads Germans to believe\r\nthe whole world was made for Germans. This German musician, for\r\ninstance, arrives in Paris, where scores of French musicians--Berlioz\r\namongst them--are roughing it, if not actually starving in the\r\nstreets; yet he expects the French to find him employment in\r\npreference to their own countrymen, their own flesh and blood. One can\r\noverlook that, however; and the story is pathetic and beautifully\r\nwritten. _A Pilgrimage to Beethoven_ is, in its way, a masterpiece. It\r\nalso is full of self-revelation; some of it conscious, some\r\nunconscious. _A Happy Evening_ is another charming thing; the skit on\r\nhow Rossini's _Stabat Mater_ came to be composed is amusing, and is\r\ncruel with a cruelty that was justified. The other articles are of no\r\nparticular value, save, perhaps, that on the overture; they are of an\r\nephemeral character and were evidently concocted when the writer was\r\nfully aware he was writing for French readers, and if he hurt French\r\nfeelings or vanity, a French editor wouldn't print, wouldn't publish,\r\nwouldn't pay.\r\n\r\nThe next production of any importance is his autobiographical sketch,\r\nand of this nothing need be said. So much of it as seemed to me\r\nneedful has been utilized in this book. The account of the bringing\r\nhome of Weber's remains to Dresden from London has a perennial\r\ninterest. We know how Wagner idolized his mighty predecessor, and can\r\nimagine the ardour with which he threw himself into this work.\r\nSeemingly insuperable obstacles, most of them placed in the way\r\nthrough the native stupidity and perversity of German and English\r\nofficialdom, had to be overridden, and Wagner triumphed. The speech\r\ndelivered on the occasion of the re-interment is\r\ncharacteristic--exceptionally so even for Wagner of this period,\r\n1844--in its assertion of the Germanity of Weber and Weber's music;\r\nand his deep joy that at last the German musician's bones should\r\nrepose in German earth. This topic of Germanism haunted Wagner for\r\nyears, and I may have a little to say about it later. The account of\r\nthe 1846 rendering of the Choral Symphony is the most masterly\r\nexposition of the right and the wrong way of playing orchestral music\r\nto be found in any language. Wagner's method was, after all, very\r\nsimple: the conductor had to understand and feel the music aright, and\r\nthen pains, pains, never-ending pains must be expended on coaxing,\r\npersuading, bullying or in some other way getting the band to\r\nreproduce precisely what he felt.\r\n\r\nWe now reach the mass of theatrical and philosophical writings on\r\nopera, drama, and, indeed, art generally. I need do nothing more than\r\ngive the fundamental basis of them all, the one point which he argues\r\nin a thousand ways through them all. Wagner would have it, then, that\r\njust about the time he came into the world, or a little later,\r\nall--nothing less than all--the arts had gone as far as they could\r\nseparately, each alone. Art in ancient days, before there were _arts_,\r\nwas a fusion of music, dancing, poetry, statuary and painting--the old\r\ndrama. That each form of art might develop its full possibilities,\r\nthey separated and each went its own way. Wagner was mainly concerned\r\nwith music and with drama (poetic drama). Music reached its apogee\r\nwith Beethoven. Regardless of the fact that after Beethoven had\r\nintroduced words in the Choral Symphony, he went on composing music of\r\nunequalled depth and splendour without words, Wagner insisted that he\r\nfelt the impossibility of doing more without words. We hear, said\r\nWagner, all these sounds going on, this stream of melody, and it is\r\nvery delightful to the ear; but unfortunately the highly organized\r\nbrain of modern man steps in and insists on knowing what is the\r\nmatter. What is the meaning of it all? asks the inquisitive intellect.\r\nWords are necessary to satisfy the intellect. On the other hand,\r\npoetic drama, in its endeavour to express pure feeling, could go no\r\nfurther than Goethe and Schiller without becoming mere gush--a sort of\r\nmusic that was not music. Wherefore music must be added. But this\r\ncombination of music and poetry was insufficient; we must have the\r\nthing in visible form before the eye--the acted music-drama. Then the\r\nactors must understand statuesque poses and get into them; they must\r\nunderstand painting and contrive to form themselves, together with the\r\nscenic background and accessories, into pictures. So once again we\r\nshould have the perfect fusion of all the arts, and live happily ever\r\nafter.\r\n\r\nTo me there is almost more lunacy in this than in Wagner's political\r\ntenets. It is a pack of fallacies. Here is my answer--\r\n\r\n(i) As to an Art which was a perfect fusion of all the arts, it was\r\nnever done and never at any time attempted.\r\n\r\n(ii) The finest music yet created has no words to it: the meaning is\r\nperfectly clear without words.\r\n\r\n(iii) The highest poetic drama needs no music. Without verging on\r\ngush, it affords expression to the deepest and most intense feeling.\r\n\r\n(iv) Fine poetry has been written in the dramatic form, though it will\r\nnot bear acting and was not intended to be acted. But we may\r\ncheerfully concede that genuine drama ought to be acted.\r\n\r\n(v) The function of scenery is to suggest atmosphere and nothing more.\r\nIt cannot be a picture; it can only be an imitation of a picture.\r\n\r\n(vi) An actor who tried to look like a statue going through a variety\r\nof poses would only make the audience laugh; or we should think he had\r\nbeen taken ill.\r\n\r\nAt every point Wagner's reasoning goes to the ground. His basic facts\r\nare no facts, and his reasoning is absurd. All the essays on music and\r\non drama and on the music-drama are as much an expression of himself\r\nas his music-dramas. I have in earlier chapters gone so far as even to\r\nlabour the point that he could not get on in music without the aid of\r\ndrama; and as he could never look beyond himself nor imagine that\r\nwhat he could not do--_i.e._ compose pure music--some one else--_e.g._\r\nSchumann or Brahms--could do, he went out with absolute confidence to\r\npersuade the world that he was right and all others were wrong. To\r\nthose who may be interested in the study of Wagner, the mighty\r\ncreative artist, as a cerebral curiosity, I commend Mr. Newman's book\r\naforementioned. Mr. Newman points out that Wagner was so magnificently\r\nself-centred that he attributed all opposition to \"misunderstanding.\"\r\nTo him it was incomprehensible that any one should say, \"Yes, I\r\nperfectly understand your argument; but I beg leave not to agree with\r\nyou.\" Any one who said that at once aroused his suspicions; such an\r\none, thought Wagner, cannot possibly be sincere. Hence the hot\r\ndenunciations of all and sundry who differed from him; hence the\r\nnightmare phantom of an organized body of \"persecutors.\" Had he not\r\nbeen blinded by his wrath, and looked a little closer, he might have\r\nseen that the persecutors, far from being an organized body or\r\nconfederacy, were fighting angrily, bitterly, amongst themselves. Many\r\nof them had this in common: they could not understand and did not like\r\nWagner's music. That is different from the \"wilful misunderstanding\"\r\nWagner moaned about. These musicians could not help themselves; as\r\nSancho Panza remarks, \"Man is as God made him, and generally a good\r\ndeal worse.\"\r\n\r\nThe essay which provoked the widest and fiercest hostility, especially\r\namongst the Jews, was the _Judaism in Music_. Wagner started from two\r\npremises, (i) That the Jews, being alien in thought and feeling, could\r\nnot express themselves in _our (i.e._ German) art; and (2) that had\r\nthey thought and felt like Germans, they would have succeeded no\r\nbetter; for music--that is, song--is idealized speech, and the\r\ngurglings and bubblings which do duty for speech with the Jews cannot\r\nbe idealized into anything beautiful. The answer is that very great\r\nmusic has been written by Jews; that music was an English, a Flemish\r\nand an Italian art before the Germans knew anything about it; that if\r\nmusic must be idealized German speech, with its guttural chokings, the\r\nless we have of it the better. The Jews paid little attention to\r\nWagner's arguments, but objected to his \"personalities.\" Now, the\r\nreader must have observed that of all people practical jokers are\r\nthose who can least tolerate a practical joke played at their own\r\nexpense, and that those whose staple of conversation is banter or\r\n\"chaff\" become irascible the moment they are flicked with their own\r\nwhip. For years Wagner had been the victim of unprovoked personal\r\nattacks in the Jew-controlled press, and some of the worst of these\r\ncan be traced to Jew scribblers. Yet on the publication of _Judaism in\r\nMusic_ in the _Neue Zeitschrift für Musik_, a wail went up from these\r\njournalistic descendants of Elijah; and several prominent Jew\r\nmusicians signed and presented to the authorities of the Leipzig\r\nconservatoire of music a petition praying that Brendel (the editor who\r\npublished the essay) might be dismissed from his post in the\r\nconservatoire. These underhand tactics put the Jews out of court.\r\nNevertheless, Wagner's essay was a bad mistake. It is bad science, bad\r\nhistory, bad argument; it did no person, no cause, any good, and it\r\nworked a very great deal of harm.\r\n\r\nWagner was at his best when writing about music or about musicians he\r\nhad known. A paper on Spontini, belonging to this period (Spontini\r\ndied in 1851), has a pleasant, generous note; and the account of the\r\npompous old gentleman's visit to Dresden a few years previous is\r\namusingly lifelike. The _Communication to my Friends_, a trifle\r\negotistical, is still full of interest. The article on musical\r\ncriticism is not so good as it might have been. Wagner had the utmost\r\ncontempt for the ordinary press criticism of the day: with that sort\r\nof thing, he wrote Uhlig, one could not tempt the cat from behind the\r\nstove. He knew what criticism should not be, but when he came to what\r\nit should be his view was warped by the obsession that pure music had\r\nreached its boundaries, and the future of music was involved with the\r\nfuture of the music-drama. When his prejudices were not aroused, he\r\nhimself was the greatest critic who has lived: his programmes of the\r\nChoral and Eroica Symphonies are masterpieces in their kind; and his\r\nanalysis of the _Iphigenia in Aulis_ overture can never be surpassed.\r\nStage-managers have found his directions for the performing of\r\n_Tannhäuser_, _Lohengrin_ and the _Dutchman_ invaluable; they are also\r\nsometimes read by conductors, and should be read by singers. They show\r\nhow in composing his operas Wagner meant every note he put to paper:\r\nthe most minute fibres of the musical growth are alive, a living part\r\nof the organism.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\"I shall probably never come back to Germany.\" So wrote Wagner from\r\nParis on March 2, 1855, to his friend Wilhelm Fischer, stage-manager\r\nand chorus-master at the Dresden opera. Wagner was then on his way to\r\nLondon to direct a series of Philharmonic concerts. \"It was a great\r\npiece of folly for me to come to London....\" So wrote Wagner from\r\nLondon to Fischer a little--perhaps a month--later. It was, says Mr.\r\nJ.S. Shedlock in his admirable translation of the _Letters to Dresden\r\nFriends_, \"an unfortunate visit.\" But was it? and, if so, in what\r\nsense? \"The public of the Philharmonic concerts is very favourably\r\ndisposed towards me.\" \"The orchestra has taken a great liking to me,\r\nand the public approves of me.\" And as a matter of fact Wagner had no\r\nreason to be dissatisfied with the visit, nor has Mr. Shedlock for\r\ncalling it \"unfortunate.\" The whole situation is summed up in another\r\ncommunication to Fischer, dated London, June 15, 1855--\r\n\r\n    \"... The false reports about my quarrel with the directors of\r\n    the Philharmonic Society here and my consequent departure from\r\n    London are based upon the following incident--\r\n\r\n    \"When I went into the cloak-room after the fourth concert, I\r\n    there met several friends, whom I made acquainted with my\r\n    extreme annoyance and ill-humour that I should ever have\r\n    consented to conduct concerts of such a kind, as it was not at\r\n    all in my line. These endless programmes, with their mass of\r\n    instrumental and vocal pieces, wearied me and tormented my\r\n    aesthetic sense; I was forced to see that the power of\r\n    established custom rendered it impossible to bring about any\r\n    reduction or change whatever; I therefore nourished a feeling of\r\n    disquietude, which had more to do with the fact that I had again\r\n    embarked on a thing of the sort--much less with the conditions\r\n    here themselves, which I really knew beforehand--but least of\r\n    all with my public, which always received me with friendliness\r\n    and approbation, often indeed with great warmth.\r\n\r\n    \"On the other hand, the abuse of the London critics was a matter\r\n    of perfect indifference to me, for their hostility only proved\r\n    to all the world that I had not bribed them, while it gave me,\r\n    on the contrary, much satisfaction to watch how they always left\r\n    the door open, so that had I made the least approach they would\r\n    have turned to different pitch; but naturally I thought of\r\n    nothing of the kind....\r\n\r\n    \"On that evening I was really in a furious rage, that after the\r\n    A minor Symphony I should have had to conduct a miserable vocal\r\n    piece and a trivial overture of Onslow's; and, as is my way, in\r\n    deepest dudgeon I told my friends aloud that I had that day\r\n    conducted for the last time; that on the morrow I should send in\r\n    my resignation, and journey home. By chance a concert-singer,\r\n    R---- (a German-Jew youth) was present; he caught up my words\r\n    and conveyed them all hot to a newspaper reporter. Ever since\r\n    then rumours have been flying about in the German papers, which\r\n    have misled even you. I need scarcely tell you that the\r\n    representations of my friends, who escorted me home, succeeded\r\n    in making me withdraw the hasty resolution conceived at a moment\r\n    of despondency.\r\n\r\n    \"Since then we have had the _Tannhäuser_ overture at the fifth\r\n    concert; it was very well played, received by the public in a\r\n    quite friendly manner, but not yet properly understood.\r\n\r\n    \"All the more pleased was I, therefore, when the Queen, who had\r\n    promised (which is a rare event, and does not happen every year)\r\n    to attend the seventh concert, ordered a repetition of the\r\n    overture. Now, if in itself it was extremely gratifying that the\r\n    Queen should pay no regard to my highly compromised political\r\n    position (which had been dragged to light with great malignity\r\n    by the _Times_), and without hesitation assist at a public\r\n    performance under my direction, then her further behaviour\r\n    towards me afforded me at last an affecting compensation for all\r\n    the contrarieties and vulgar animosities which I had here\r\n    endured.\r\n\r\n    \"She and Prince Albert, who both sat immediately facing the\r\n    orchestra, applauded after the _Tannhäuser_ overture--with which\r\n    the first part concluded--with graciousness, almost amounting to\r\n    a challenge, so that the public broke out into lively and\r\n    prolonged applause. During the interval the Queen summoned me to\r\n    the _salon_, and received me before her court with the cordial\r\n    words, 'I am delighted to make your acquaintance; your\r\n    composition has enraptured me!'\r\n\r\n    \"In a long conversation, in which Prince Albert also took part,\r\n    she further inquired about my other works, and asked if it would\r\n    not be possible to have my operas translated into Italian, so\r\n    that she might be able to hear them, too, in London? I was\r\n    naturally obliged to give a negative answer, and, moreover, to\r\n    explain that my visit was only a flying one, as conducting for a\r\n    concert society--the only thing open to me here--was not at all\r\n    my affair. At the end of the concert the Queen and the Prince\r\n    applauded me again most courteously.\r\n\r\n    \"I relate this to you because it will afford you pleasure; and I\r\n    willingly allow you to make further use of this information, as\r\n    I see how much mistake and malice touching myself and my stay in\r\n    London has to be set right or defeated.\r\n\r\n    \"The last concert is on the 25th, and I leave on the 26th, so as\r\n    to resume in my quiet retreat my sadly interrupted work.\"\r\n\r\nWagner was well paid for his work; he was well received in society;\r\nthe band liked him and the audiences liked him--the one cause of all\r\nhis grumbling was the character of the bulk of the music he had to\r\nconduct. One might expect even a Wagner to prefer conducting a few\r\npieces of tedious stuff, even to put up with poor antediluvian Onslow,\r\nrather than to return to his daily task of writing begging letters to\r\nhis friends from Zurich. Still, these are matters of taste, and each\r\nto his own.\r\n\r\nTo those who only know the Philharmonic to-day, in its more or less\r\nrepentant and reformed state, it may not seem odd that Wagner should\r\nhave conducted its concerts. But to those who remember it from, say,\r\ntwenty-five years ago to quite recent times, a certain incongruity is\r\napparent. Wagner, the sincere, fiery artist, the man devoted to,\r\nswallowed up by, his art; the man who journeyed, with his wife and a\r\ndog, all the way from Russia to Paris with his bare travelling\r\nexpenses in his pocket; who had been through a bloody revolution, and\r\nwas now a political refugee; who had written part of the _Ring_ and\r\nhad _Tristan_ \"already planned in his head\"; a conductor whose ideal\r\nwas nothing lower than perfection--this gentleman came from Zurich to\r\nconduct a society whose membership was compact of trim and prim\r\nmediocrity, and whose directors were mostly duffers. Can we wonder\r\nthat both sides were disappointed? These amiable directors never quite\r\nrecovered from the honour of having Mendelssohn to conduct for them;\r\nand they undoubtedly looked upon Wagner as scarcely a next-best. The\r\ndays of oratorio had by no means finished yet; oratorio was the thing;\r\nan instrumental concert was very well for a change once in a while,\r\nprovided there were plenty of Italian opera airs to sugar the nasty\r\npill; Haydn was the last word in symphony, the homage paid to\r\nBeethoven being the merest lip-worship. The Philharmonic was certainly\r\nno place for Wagner; yet, it must be insisted, there was no real\r\nreason for grumbling on either side. Wagner got his money; the society\r\nhad one of the best seasons on its record.\r\n\r\nIt is a pity that he who might have been the most valuable witness in\r\nthe matter should prove at every point to be the least trustworthy.\r\nFerdinand Praeger had known Wagner in his university days. They seem\r\nto have been barely acquainted; but the moment Praeger found Wagner\r\nwas coming he scented advertisement for himself, as is usual with his\r\nkind--the kind being the foreign professor settled in London. He will\r\nhave it that he arranged the whole business; but the terrible truth is\r\nthat he seems to have done no more than make his compatriot\r\ncomfortable in our dreary city. Certainly he did that, and Wagner\r\nrepaid it by inviting him to stay in Zurich, and the visit came off\r\nduly. Sainton, who was by way of being a noted violinist, was head and\r\nfront of the offending from the directors' point of view--perhaps in\r\nWagner's view likewise. The directors were, to speak as the vulgar, in\r\na mortal stew. There was a small audience for orchestral functions in\r\nthose days, and Dr. Wylde, a worthy academic gentleman of no musical\r\ndistinction whatever, had started a rival series of concerts, and had\r\nin this year, 1855, engaged no less a personage than Berlioz to\r\nconduct. A rival was looked for; and since the directors knew little\r\nor nothing of continental doings, as soon as Sainton told them one\r\nRichard Wagner was their man, they agreed that negotiations should be\r\nopened. Wagner came; and the visit ought to be interesting to English\r\nmusicians, for at Portland Terrace he scored part of the _Valkyrie_.\r\nMoreover, he met Berlioz at dinner; but never those twain could meet\r\nin other than a formal way. Neither liked the other; neither liked the\r\nother's music; their rivalry in London mattered not two sous to the\r\none or one pfennig to the other, but they were both disappointed men\r\nseeking appreciation and approbation on the continent. Wagner had\r\ntried in Paris and Berlioz had tried in Germany. Wagner worked\r\nstubbornly the whole time, and was mightily glad to get back to Zurich\r\nin July. The episode is of small importance in Wagner's life; but the\r\nattitude of the Press naturally filled him with disgust. He said if he\r\nhad paid the critics he would have received \"favourable notices,\" and\r\nwhen I reflect on the smallness of the critics' official salaries and\r\nthe splendour in which some of them lived I cannot but think he was\r\nright: the money necessary to keep up big establishments had to be\r\nfound somewhere--where?\r\n\r\nDuring the next few years Wagner went many journeys, again mainly in\r\nsearch of \"cures,\" but never got far. He worked unceasingly at the\r\n_Ring_, with the wildest plans in his head regarding performances. How\r\nwild some of these must have seemed at the time may be judged from the\r\nfollowing paragraphs taken from a letter to Uhlig (Dec. 12, 1851).\r\nThis is, of course, earlier than the period we are now dealing with;\r\nbut he never departed from the idea, and it eventually took shape at\r\nBayreuth, a quarter of a century later. Here is the letter--\r\n\r\n    \"For the moment, I can only tell you a little about the\r\n    intended completion of the great dramatic poem which I have now\r\n    in hand. Just reflect that before I wrote the poem, _Siegfried's\r\n    Death_, I sketched out the whole myth in all its gigantic\r\n    sequence, and that poem was the attempt--which, with regard to\r\n    our theatre, appeared possible to me--to give one chief\r\n    catastrophe of the myth, together with an indication of that\r\n    sequence.\r\n\r\n    \"Now, when I set to work to write out the music in full, still\r\n    keeping our modern theatre firmly in mind, I felt how incomplete\r\n    the proposed undertaking would be; the vast train of events,\r\n    which first gives to the characters their immense and striking\r\n    significance, would be presented to the mind merely by means of\r\n    epic narrative.\r\n\r\n    \"So to make _Siegfried's Death_ possible, I wrote _Young\r\n    Siegfried_; but the more the whole took shape, the more did I\r\n    perceive, while developing the scenes and music of _Young\r\n    Siegfried_, that I had only increased the necessity for a\r\n    clearer presentation of the whole story to the senses. I now see\r\n    that, in order to become intelligible on the stage, I must work\r\n    out the whole myth in plastic style. It was not this\r\n    consideration alone which impelled me to my new plan, but\r\n    especially the overpowering impressiveness of the subject-matter\r\n    which I thus acquire for presentation, and which supplies me\r\n    with a wealth of material for artistic fashioning which it would\r\n    be a sin to leave unused. Think of the contents of the narrative\r\n    of Brünnhilde, in the last scene of _Young Siegfried_; the fate\r\n    of Siegmund and Sieglind; the struggle of Wotan with his desire\r\n    and with custom (Fricka); the noble defiance of the Walküre; the\r\n    tragic anger of Wotan in punishing this defiance.\r\n\r\n    \"Think of this from my point of view, with the extraordinary\r\n    wealth of situations brought together in one coherent drama, and\r\n    you have a tragedy of most moving effect; one which clearly\r\n    presents to the senses all that my public needs to have taken\r\n    in, in order easily to understand, in their widest meaning,\r\n    _Young Siegfried_ and the _Death_. These three dramas will be\r\n    preceded by a grand introductory play, which will be produced by\r\n    itself on a special opening festival day. It begins with\r\n    Alberich, who pursues the three water-witches of the Rhine with\r\n    his lust of love, is rejected with merry fooling by one after\r\n    the other, and, mad with rage, at last steals the Rhine gold\r\n    from them.\r\n\r\n    \"This gold in itself is only a shining ornament in the depth of\r\n    the waves (_Siegfried's Death_, Act III, Sc. i), but it\r\n    possesses another power, which only he who renounces love can\r\n    succeed in drawing from it. (Here you have the plasmic motive up\r\n    to _Siegfried's Death_. Think of all its pregnant consequences.)\r\n    The capture of Alberich; the dividing of the gold between the\r\n    two giant brothers; the speedy fulfilment of Alberich's curse on\r\n    these two, the one of whom immediately slays the other--all this\r\n    is the theme of this introductory play.\r\n\r\n    \"But I have already chattered too much, and even that is too\r\n    little to give you a clear idea of the vast wealth of the\r\n    subject-matter....\r\n\r\n    \"But one other thing determined me to develop this plan; viz.\r\n    the impossibility which I felt of producing _Young Siegfried_ in\r\n    anything like a suitable manner either at Weimar or anywhere\r\n    else. I cannot and will not endure any more the martyrdom of\r\n    things done by halves. With this my new conception I withdraw\r\n    entirely from all connection with our theatre and public of\r\n    to-day; I break decisively and for ever with the formal present.\r\n\r\n    \"Do you now ask me what I propose to do with my scheme?--First\r\n    of all to carry it out, so far as my poetical and musical powers\r\n    will allow. This will occupy me at least three full years. And\r\n    so I place my future quite in R----'s hands; God grant that\r\n    they may remain unfalteringly true to me!\r\n\r\n    \"I can only think of a performance under quite other conditions.\r\n    I shall erect a theatre on the banks of the Rhine, and issue\r\n    invitations to a great dramatic festival. After a year's\r\n    preparation, I shall produce my complete work in a series of\r\n    four days.\r\n\r\n    \"However extravagant this plan may be, it is, nevertheless, the\r\n    only one to which I can devote my life and labours. If I live to\r\n    see it accomplished, I have lived gloriously; if not, I die for\r\n    something grand. Only this can still give me any pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nHis creditors from Dresden were everlastingly at his heels; even in\r\nDresden, with a substantial and regular salary, he could not keep out\r\nof debt--though it must be remembered that older debts pursued him\r\nfrom the Riga days, and even earlier. By April of 1856 the _Valkyrie_\r\nwas scored and _Siegfried_ begun; next year he finished the first act\r\nof the latter. His life, apparently, went on pretty much as before;\r\nbut the financial situation was rapidly becoming intolerable--even to\r\nhim. The famous invitation to write an opera for Rio de Janeiro\r\narrived, and he promptly set to work on the subject he had mentioned\r\nin a letter to Liszt a few years before, _Tristan and Isolda_. His\r\nhealth grew worse than ever, and somehow he found the means to spend\r\nthe winter in Venice. Then he settled for a while in Lucerne, and\r\ncompleted _Tristan_.\r\n\r\nAfterwards he removed to Paris, where in 1860 he gave some concerts;\r\nin the same year the score of _Tristan_ was issued; next year came the\r\n_Tannhäuser_ fiasco at the opera, and later he heard _Lohengrin_, in\r\nVienna, for the first time; next he stayed for a while at Biebrich,\r\nand finally settled in Vienna.\r\n\r\nThis is all the biography of ten of the fullest years of his life that\r\nwe need trouble about at present. His everyday existence is only\r\ndiversified and variegated by little anecdotes not worth repetition.\r\nHe was everywhere, of course, the musical lion. And, speaking of\r\nanimals, he always had a few: it had been a real grief to him some\r\nyears before when his parrot died when it had just mastered a passage\r\nof Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.\r\n\r\nWhen he finished _Tristan_ in August of 1859, his prospects were, so\r\nto speak, as bright as before. It may here be mentioned, by way of\r\nshowing how bright that was, that when, four years later, an attempt\r\nwas made to give _Tristan_ at Vienna, the work was abandoned after at\r\nleast fifty rehearsals.\r\n\r\nHis letters, first to his faithful servitor Uhlig, who died in 1853 at\r\nthe age of thirty-one, and then to Fischer, are full of requests to\r\nget scores copied, to send them here, there and everywhere, and to\r\ncollect honorariums. But, as I have said, for years he had hungry\r\ncreditors snapping at his heels, and they devoured most of the fruits\r\nof his early genius. It is a fact to be faced that Wagner never in all\r\nhis life earned his livelihood. He earned more than average men\r\nrequire to live comfortably upon; but he was unceasingly extravagant,\r\nand denied himself nothing. He had been hungry in his early Paris\r\ndays; for the remainder of his life he bent himself to the task of\r\nmaking up for that spell of famine. The precariousness of his income,\r\nthe insecurity of his position, fostered the habit of self-indulgence;\r\nby nature the reverse of miserly, if he had money to-day he spent it,\r\nreflecting that he might have none to-morrow. His debts, moreover,\r\nwere not entirely for what we may call personal extravagances. So\r\nconfident and sanguine was he that he had the full scores of his\r\noperas published at his own expense; and the charges had to be met out\r\nof what the operas brought him. And so when he had finished _Tristan_\r\nin 1859 the outlook was of the blackest.\r\n\r\nIt was not less than a disaster that, during this period, 1849-59,\r\nWagner got to know the writings of Schopenhauer. In my first chapter I\r\npointed out how from his youth Wagner was fond of dabbling in\r\npseudo-philosophy, and this had strengthened rather than weakened its\r\nhold on him as he grew older. For some time Feuerbach was his mentor.\r\nIt is idle to ask what he saw in Feuerbach. It has long been a\r\ncommonplace that rightly to understand an author you must meet him\r\nhalf-way. Wagner did more than that: he went the whole way, and often\r\na long way beyond. What he read was not Feuerbach, but the thousand\r\nideas that the merest chance sentences of Feuerbach aroused in his\r\nseething brain. Feuerbach, however, was sent about his business as\r\nsoon as Schopenhauer entered. Wagner immediately wrote\r\nenthusiastically to Liszt, telling how peace and light had come into\r\nhis soul; and one might wonder what particular doctrine of the grumpy\r\nold pseudo-philosopher had this remarkable effect. (This is to assume\r\nit to have had the effect. As a bare matter of fact it hadn't.\r\nWagner's soul knew no peace until he died.) It was the great gospel of\r\nRenunciation. After reading this, in his own way, Wagner realized, if\r\nyou please, that both _Tannhäuser_ and _Lohengrin_ preached the same\r\ndoctrine; and one can only retort that, if they preach any doctrine at\r\nall--which they don't, thank heaven!--it is not that. But\r\nSchopenhauerism might easily have ruined _Tristan_--did not ruin it\r\nonly because Wagner himself, when writing it, was consumed with a\r\nfervour of passion that is the negation of Schopenhauerism. It is\r\nresponsible, however, for many of the _longueurs_ of the _Ring_, as,\r\nfor instance, in Act II of the _Valkyrie_, when Wotan stops the action\r\nto give Brünnhilde an elementary lesson in Schopenhauer-cum-Wagner\r\nmetaphysics. The funny thing is that Wagner never renounced anything:\r\nto the end he was greedy, avid of life. He might have benefited by a\r\ncareful study of Schopenhauer's pungent phrases; but instead of thus\r\ndeveloping his own natural gift in that direction, his sentences\r\nafterwards grew longer and more complicated than ever. His Beethoven\r\nis a splendid essay; how much finer it might have been had he not\r\nwasted so many pages on what he took to be Schopenhauer's science!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n'TRISTAN AND ISOLDA'\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nFor those who have ears, eyes and understanding _Tristan and Isolda_\r\nis Wagner's most perfect work, is the finest opera in the world.\r\nUnluckily there are in the world far too many persons who are not\r\ncontent to have a work of supreme art, but must needs read into it\r\nold, stale platitudes: when they have proved it to be an exposition of\r\nthese platitudes they conceive that they have deserved the gratitude\r\nof the people for interpreting the artist and of the artist for having\r\ninterpreted him, having made his meaning clear. As I have written\r\nelsewhere of _Tristan_, \"Wagner's consummate dramatic art, stage-craft\r\nand knowledge of stage effect have combined to make all clear as the\r\nday\"; but the commentators have rushed in with their comments between\r\nthe stage and the audience only to obscure everything and bamboozle\r\npeople who are at least as capable as themselves of understanding the\r\ndrama. The platitudes read into _Tristan_ are of two sorts, truisms\r\nand lying commonplaces. To take one of the latter kind, some one many\r\nlong years ago got off the pretty phrase, \"love and death are one\";\r\nand poetasters and fiftieth-rate dramatists have ever since continued\r\nto assert as a profound and original truth that love and death are\r\none. What on earth they understand by it, if they mean anything at\r\nall, is much more than I can guess. But I know that love and death are\r\nnot one, that love is life, and death is death. We have had it pointed\r\nout a thousand times that the \"moral\" of _Tristan_ is that these two\r\nopposites are one; and in the latest books and articles about Wagner\r\nthe same game is kept merrily going. I can extract no such moral.\r\nPerhaps some unfortunate essays and letters of Wagner gave the\r\ncommentators their cue and lead; for Wagner, when he put away his\r\nmusic-paper and sat down to his writing-paper, often showed himself a\r\nwilling victim of catch-phrases; also many sentences of the drama can\r\nbe construed as paraphrases of this particular catch-phrase--for\r\nexample, \"Nun banne das Bangen, holder Tod, sehnend verlangter\r\nLiebestod.\" Such utterances as these, however, have a specific and\r\ndifferent meaning altogether, as will presently be seen. I can by no\r\nmeans believe even Wagner capable of writing a three-act music-drama\r\nto prove the truth of a catch-phrase or that he would have dreamed of\r\nusing such a catch-phrase as the motive of his music-drama. The\r\ncommonplaces drawn from _Tristan_ and gravely set forth as the\r\n\"meanings\" of the operas are as numberless as sands on the sea-shore\r\nand rather less valuable. That young women should not make a practice\r\nof marrying old men, that illicit passions and intrigues may bring on\r\ndisaster, that it is madness to make love to another man's wife in a\r\ngarden, observable by all, that it is greater madness still to keep on\r\nwhen a maidservant is screaming that some one is coming--these rules\r\nof conduct are very well in their way and might commend themselves to\r\nthe denizens of Clapham; but, again, I hardly think Wagner would have\r\nconstructed a great music-drama to enunciate them. Nor did he\r\nconstruct his music-drama to expound a philosophy. For a long time the\r\nair was thick with arguments _pro_ and _con_ with regard to the amount\r\nof Schopenhauer he had made use of in his libretto. Now, it is true\r\nthat both Tristan and Isolda indulge at times in something\r\napproximating to the Schopenhauer terminology; but of Schopenhauer's\r\nor any other philosophy I cannot find a trace. For that we must turn\r\nto _Parsifal_. In _Tristan_ there are no \"meanings\"--none save the\r\nvery plain meaning of the drama and the meaning of the music, which is\r\nplainer still.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me desirable in this way to clear off misunderstandings\r\nand to indicate with precision my point of view. When Wagner wrote\r\n_Tristan_ he wrote a tragic opera of passion and treachery and death,\r\nand only as a tragic opera can I regard it. Every sentence in it is\r\naccounted for by the course the drama takes; no further explanation is\r\ncalled for; and I shall certainly not waste my readers' time by\r\npicking out a few words here and there and trying to construe them\r\ninto a metaphysical exposition: there is quite enough to digest\r\nwithout that. Even the longing for death which Tristan expresses as\r\nthe only cure for the woes of an impossible life arises from the\r\ndrama; Tristan no more preaches Schopenhauer than he preaches Buddhism\r\nwhen he exclaims \"Nun banne das Bangen, holder Tod.\" Wagner chose the\r\nsubject of _Tristan_ not to expound anything, but for the prosaic\r\nreason that he wanted to raise money and the subject seemed the most\r\npromising for the purpose. This is put beyond a doubt by a letter to\r\nLiszt dated July 2, 1858. Everything seemed to work against him;\r\n_Rienzi_ proved a failure when it was put on at Weimar, and nothing\r\ncould be hoped for in that quarter; the pecuniary situation was\r\ndesperate. He had received a commission from the Emperor Pedro I of\r\nBrazil for an opera, and thought _Tristan_ a likely theme. As early as\r\nDecember of 1854 he had written to Liszt mentioning it as planned in\r\nhis head; and in this letter of '58 he says, \"... I saw no other way\r\nopen to me but to negotiate with Härtel, and I chose for this subject\r\n_Tristan_, then scarcely begun, because I had nothing else. They\r\noffered to pay me half the honorarium (two hundred louis d'or)--that\r\nis, one hundred louis d'or--on receipt of the score of the first act,\r\nand I made all the haste I could to complete it. That is why this poor\r\nwork was hurried on in such a business-like manner.\" It seems rather\r\ncomical now that the world's most magnificent, and certainly most\r\nprofound, musical tragedy should have been commenced to be sung by an\r\nItalian company in such an out-of-the-way spot as Rio de Janeiro and\r\nin the hope of pleasing semi-barbarian ears; and it is rather a pity\r\nit never found its way there. One thing is certain: the press\r\ncriticisms could not have been more foolish than those that greeted\r\nthe opera when it was produced in Munich.\r\n\r\nExactly where Wagner got the idea from I cannot say. Of course, in\r\none shape or another the legend exists in every European literature;\r\nand probably he had been familiar with it for years. Praeger's story\r\nof Wagner getting hold of Gottfried von Strassburg's interminable\r\nversion in the summer of 1855 and conceiving the thing in a flash\r\nmight very well be true; only, unluckily for Praeger, the letter to\r\nLiszt in the previous year shows it to be in another sense a story. By\r\nSeptember 1857 the poem was done, and Wagner at once set to work on\r\nthe music. He had sketched the first act by the end of the same year,\r\nand in the early part of '59 the whole opera was complete. We have\r\njust seen one reason for pressing forward \"this poor work ... in such\r\na business-like manner\"; but even without the pecuniary inducement I\r\nfancy he would have composed quickly. _Tristan_ is one of those works,\r\nlike Carlyle's _French Revolution_, which one feels had either to be\r\nwritten rapidly or not at all. The music seems to have welled forth in\r\na red-hot torrent, and his pen could not choose but fly over the\r\npaper. None the less we are compelled to marvel at the industry, the\r\nconcentrated and continuous and patient energy of the man; for the\r\n_Tristan_ score is as complicated as any ever written, and the mere\r\nnumber of notes to be set down might well have appalled him. Handel\r\ncould write a _Messiah_ in three weeks and Mozart a _Don Giovanni_\r\noverture in a few hours; but their scores are mere skeletons compared\r\nwith _Tristan_, a score which neither Handel nor Mozart could copy in\r\na much longer time than three weeks. We may hope that Wagner received\r\nhis remaining hundred louis d'or, for the Brazilian scheme came to\r\nnothing, and he had to wait seven long years before _Tristan_ got its\r\nfirst performance. But for the \"kingly friend,\" mad Ludwig II, it\r\nwould not have been performed at all; and afterwards other theatres\r\nfound it too difficult, or the directors, with true inborn official\r\ninsolence, seemed to glory in not so much as looking at the score. We\r\nwill now look at it.\r\n\r\nOut of one or another of the various versions of the legend Wagner\r\nextracted the core--the plain, direct story of the passion of a pair\r\nof tragic lovers. Tristan and Isolda love one another with a devouring\r\nlove, and circumstances will not allow them to be united; they find a\r\nrefuge in death from an existence intolerable without love; and this\r\nis essentially the whole story. In its older form the tale consisted\r\nmainly of what to the modern mind are excrescences--the intrigues,\r\nfights, adventures and what not so dear to the mediæval mind. Wagner\r\nsheared away this mass of overgrowth; or perhaps it would be truer to\r\nsay he hewed his way to the statue within, from out of the old stuff\r\npicked out the elements that made just the drama as it had shaped\r\nitself in his brain. Here is the story. Tristan, nephew of King Mark\r\nof Cornwall, had gone a-warring in Ireland and had there slain Morold,\r\nthe betrothed of Isolda; and to Isolda he sends as a present Morold's\r\nhead. He is himself wounded, and by chance it is Isolda, \"a skilful\r\nleech,\" who nurses him back to health. She has found in Morold's head\r\na splinter of a sword-blade, and finds it was broken out of Tristan's\r\nweapon. Full of anger, she raises the sword to slay the sick man: he\r\nopens his eyes, and \"the sword dropped from my fingers\"--her doom is\r\nupon her: henceforth she loves the slayer of her lover. Though Tristan\r\nloves her he does not ask for her, but with many protestations of\r\ngratitude and friendship sails away to Cornwall. Next occurs one of\r\nthose things at which most of us are apt to boggle: Tristan goes home,\r\nit would appear, only to suggest that his aged uncle should marry\r\nIsolda the peerless beauty; Mark consents, and sends Tristan to ask\r\nfor her. Tristan afterwards confesses that ambition led him to do\r\nthis; but in any case it was very close to a deed of downright\r\ntreachery, unless the fact was that Tristan did not suspect Isolda's\r\nlove for him, or thought his station too humble. Wagner's language is\r\nambiguous, and probably he intended his meaning to be the same. Isolda\r\nhas no two opinions about his conduct. It had been her duty to kill\r\nhim in the first place, and her love, her destiny, Frau Minna--call it\r\nwhat you will--betrayed her; and now she is betrayed by the man whose\r\nlife she saved. Had she spoken one word in her father's castle Tristan\r\nwould not have returned to Cornwall: in all likelihood his head would\r\nhave been sent as an acknowledgment of Morold's. Her fury knows no\r\nbounds; her grief and sense of ignominious humiliation almost defy\r\nexpression; her contempt for Tristan, when she finds words for it, is\r\nscathing. All this we learn as the opera proceeds; but we should know\r\nthe facts of the history before seeing the work the first time, else\r\nthe first act is bewildering, for matters have arrived just at this\r\npoint when the curtain rises.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe prelude is the only operatic prelude in the world which is an\r\nintegral, organic part of the drama; it cannot be omitted without\r\ndetriment to the drama. In several of Mozart's operas the overture, by\r\nmeans of a modulation, is made to lead without a break into the first\r\nscene; Gluck had done precisely the same thing; Wagner, in the\r\n_Mastersingers of Nuremberg_, did the same thing. But in the cases of\r\nGluck and Mozart and of Wagner in the _Mastersingers_, if by chance\r\nthe parts of the overture were missing, the opera could start away and\r\ngo on merrily, and we should miss nothing but the preliminary pleasure\r\nof hearing the overture. In the case of _Tristan_, where Wagner's art\r\nof combining the music and drama in an indivisible whole was at its\r\nculminating point--a point from which it gradually receded--this is\r\nnot conceivable. If the band parts of the _Tristan_ prelude were\r\nmislaid it would be well to omit the first act altogether. What Wagner\r\ntried to do in the _Flying Dutchman_--to make the whole opera a solid\r\nthing from which not one bar might be subtracted without ruining the\r\nwhole effect--he achieved once, and once only, in _Tristan_.\r\n\r\nWhat may seem an irrelevancy turns on this very point. There is no\r\nnecessity for reasoning about a work of art; yet there is both\r\npleasure and mental profit in doing so in certain instances. If there\r\nis any necessity at all for understanding Wagner's mind and Wagner's\r\nart, we may as well do it as thoroughly as we can. Therefore the\r\nreader will perhaps bear with me patiently if I point out something he\r\nhas doubtless discovered for himself, namely, that _Tristan_ is\r\nWagner's only opera in which music and drama had birth simultaneously\r\nin his brain. He himself, in several significant passages in his prose\r\nwritings, indicated this. He said that when, after several years\r\ndevoted to expounding his theories in essays,--mainly, he said, to\r\nmake these theories clear to himself: mainly, I think, for the\r\naccruing cash--he began _Tristan_, he immediately found he had left\r\nthe theories far behind. That is, he constructed his dramas, without\r\nthinking of theories or traditions, simply as a common-sense\r\ndramatist-musician should, building up the whole edifice with two\r\nhands at once, the dramatist's pen in one hand, the musician's in the\r\nother. He also said that when he set down the words the music was\r\nalready (in an amorphous state--we must presume he meant) in his\r\nbrain. It was to this effect he wrote in _Opera and Drama_ the most\r\nskilful defence ever put together by a creative artist--or rather not\r\nso much a defence as a plea for his particular form of art, or perhaps\r\nan explanation of the form.\r\n\r\nThis is entirely different from his procedure with the _Ring_, or\r\nindeed any of his works, not even excepting the _Dutchman_. The\r\n_Dutchman_, he said, grew out of Senta's ballad; but I have already\r\nshown that this statement was a mere piece of self-deception: not the\r\nwhole of the _Dutchman_, not one-tenth of it, grows out of Senta's\r\nballad; Senta's ballad is not an oak-trunk with all the solos, duets,\r\nchoruses and the rest growing out as branches with leaves grow from a\r\ntrunk--it is a scaffold-pole upon which these things are tacked in an\r\nalmost unparalleled fervour of imagination. That Wagner recognized\r\nthis is plainly seen in the prose remarks he penned, in very cold\r\nblood, in his after years, when he looked at his first really fine\r\nwork as though it had come from the hand of some other composer. Gluck\r\nhad not one-thousandth part of Wagner's sheer genius, or, born into\r\nthe nineteenth century, he might have done the thing as Wagner did it\r\nin _Tristan_; Mozart had not one-hundredth part of Wagner's\r\nintellectual power, or, born into the nineteenth century, he might\r\nhave done it. Wagner alone did it. _Tristan_ is a feat accomplished\r\nonce and for all; at this moment it is impossible to imagine such a\r\nfeat ever being done again. Those of us who live on for another five\r\nhundred years may see something like it; but even then _Tristan_ will\r\nnot be old-fashioned--not older-fashioned, at any rate, than\r\n_Antigone_ or _Hamlet_, and perhaps less old-fashioned than _Macbeth_\r\nor _Lear_. The breath, the spirit, which is eternal life, is in it,\r\nand it can only perish when the human race perishes.\r\n\r\nFar too much theorising has been done about Wagner, and I would not\r\nadd my quota did I not hope that this small contribution would save\r\ncomplicated explanations, now that I come to deal with the concrete,\r\nso to say, with the very stuff of _Tristan_, the words and the music.\r\nWe are to be prepared for a drama of human passion in sharpest\r\nconflict with a dispassionate, indifferent, even antagonistic world.\r\nThe passion is the naked elemental thing, the love of a man for a\r\nwoman and a woman for a man; and these twain, had they lived on an\r\nisland by themselves, might have been happy or unhappy, and felt the\r\npassion fade away and no one a penny the worse. As it is, everything\r\nseems to oppose them; shock after shock comes upon them; until in the\r\nend they are content, feel themselves blest, to be allowed to pass out\r\nof life. We are shown them in four clearly defined phases: first,\r\nloving one another but the love unconfessed; second, the love admitted\r\nand the world opposing it; third, love at its height and the world\r\nbreaking in upon it; last, love beaten in the fight and retreating to\r\nthe realms of death. Throughout the drama there is no musical theme\r\nrepresenting the idea of the antagonistic world. There are a dozen\r\nlove-themes and two death-themes and a great number of what in a\r\nsymphony would be called subsidiary themes. By far the most important\r\ntheme in the whole opera is that with which the prelude opens, one\r\nmade up of a couple of phrases (_a_, p. 274).\r\n\r\nI shall not for the moment discuss the full significance of the themes\r\nas subsequently unfolded: it suffices now to note the use they are\r\nput to in this prelude. A continuation of this love subject presently\r\nis announced (_b_); then the poison motive (_c_); and finally yet\r\nanother love theme. A tremendous climax is worked up: the very ecstasy\r\nand madness of love; it dies down, and the prelude ends with a\r\nsinister and tragic phrase (_d_), leading straight to a sea-song sung\r\nfrom the masthead of a vessel, on which the curtain rises.\r\n\r\nNo melody ever sang more clearly of the sea; no melody was ever less\r\nlike a sailor's chanty. I have quoted words and tune in full (_f_).\r\nThe words set the drama a-going; out of the phrase marked (_g_) the\r\nmain body of the music of the first scene is spun. Isolda very\r\nnaturally thinks an insult is aimed at herself: it is the spark that\r\nsets a light to the explosive material that has been accumulating in\r\nher heart for heaven knows how long. She curses the ship, Tristan, and\r\nevery one concerned in the conspiracy that is to rob her of the man\r\nshe loves and hand her over as a slave to the old man she has never\r\nseen. Brangaena, her maid, scared out of her wits, begs to know the\r\ntruth; Isolda screams for air, which she assuredly seems to need; the\r\ncurtains at the back of her pavilion are opened, and there, on the\r\nstern of the vessel, stands Tristan, the enemy whom she loves. From\r\nthe masthead comes again the sailor's song. This time it does not\r\nimmediately arouse Isolda to fury; for now her purpose is set--to kill\r\nTristan: take her revenge and end her own life of misery. \"Once\r\nbeloved, now removed, brave and bright, coward knight. Death-devoted\r\nhead, death-devoted heart,\" she sings, gazing at Tristan; and at the\r\nlast words we hear the tremendous death-or murder-theme (_h_), a theme\r\nwhose sinister meaning is afterwards unfolded. She sends Brangaena to\r\norder Tristan to come into her tent. He bitterly avoids understanding\r\nher meaning; Brangaena becomes more urgent; Kurvenal, Tristan's\r\nservant, a faithful watch-dog, asks to be allowed to reply; Tristan\r\nsays he can. Kurvenal bellows out a song praising Tristan as the\r\nheroic slayer of Isolda's betrothed, Morold. Brangaena precipitately\r\nretreats and closes the curtains; Isolda and she face one another in\r\nthe tent, the second nearly prostrate with dismay, the first boiling\r\nwith wrath and shame at the insult hurled at her. She now tells\r\nBrangaena the whole of the preceding history--her nursing of Tristan\r\nand his monstrous treatment of her--and finishes with another curse.\r\nBrangaena tries to soothe her; Isolda, outwardly quietened, inwardly\r\nis planning how to carry out her purpose; Brangaena unknowingly\r\nsuggests the means. \"In that casket is a love potion: drink that, you\r\nwill love your aged bridegroom and be happy once again.\" She opens the\r\ncasket; \"not that phial,\" says Isolda, \"the other.\" The poison motive\r\n(_c_) sounds under the agitated upper strings: \"the deadly draught,\"\r\nBrangaena shrieks: at this point the shouting of the sailors is heard\r\nas they begin to shorten sail; Kurvenal enters brusquely and bellows\r\nat Isolda the order to prepare to land. She refuses to move until\r\nTristan has come in to ask her pardon \"for trespass black and base.\"\r\nHere she begins to speak in terrible double-meanings: it is not\r\nTristan's discourtesy on the voyage he must apologise for, but the\r\nmore tragic occurrences leading up to his bearing her away to\r\nCornwall. She orders Brangaena to prepare the draught, and awaits her\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\nShe stands there outwardly composed while one of the finest passages\r\nin the whole of the world's music betrays her inward anxiety and\r\nsuspense (_i_). It is useless to describe the scene in any detail: the\r\nwords are simple and seemingly direct; the marvellous music alone\r\nreveals their fateful, fearful significance. Isolda asks Tristan to\r\nsink the ancient quarrel between them--caused by the slaying of\r\nMorold--and drink a cup together; he knows perfectly well a large part\r\nof her meaning--that she means to poison him. Whether she herself\r\nintends what presently occurs no one can tell: I doubt whether Wagner\r\nknew much or cared at all. Tristan knows how great is the crime he\r\nmust make amends for: not merely Morold's death, but the winning of\r\nIsolda's heart, the desertion, the cruel coming to claim her as his\r\nuncle's bride; he says he will drink--only in oblivion can he find\r\nrefuge from the toils in which he has involved himself; he lifts the\r\ncup to his lips, drinks, and as he drinks Isolda, crying \"Betrayed,\r\neven here,\" snatches the cup from him and drains it.\r\n\r\nBrangaena has betrayed her: the cup contains not the poison but the\r\nlove-potion. In this stroke there is no fairy-tale or pantomime\r\nfoolery. The course the drama now pursues is determined not by a magic\r\ndraught, a harmless infusion of herbs, but by the belief of the\r\nlovers that they have taken poison and are both doomed. Whether\r\nTristan had previously known Isolda to love him does not matter: he\r\nknows it now. It has been remarked that the language is ambiguous: or\r\nrather, Isolda in her rage may easily be supposed to go beyond the\r\ntruth when she speaks of having exchanged love-vows with Tristan. She\r\nknows that he loves her. They have only a few minutes to live and to\r\nlove: why not speak? They stand gazing at one another in a state of\r\ntremulous emotion, and at last rush into each other's arms. The hoarse\r\nvoices of the sailors are heard outside hailing King Mark; the ship\r\nhas reached land; Brangaena enters, and is horrified to find that\r\n_both_ have taken the potion; the pair cling to one another; a stream\r\nof the most passionate music in existence sweeps on: Brangaena tries\r\nto attire Isolda in the royal cloak; Kurvenal shouts to Tristan that\r\nthe king is coming; Tristan can understand nothing--\"What king?\" he\r\nasks; the deck is crowded with knights; and the curtain falls as the\r\nlovers embrace and the trumpets announce the arrival of King Mark.\r\n\r\nBefore dealing more fully with the music of this act let me quote a\r\nfew words I wrote elsewhere on the dramatic course of the whole opera.\r\n\"The end of each act sees the lovers in a situation which is at heart\r\nthe same, though in externals different. Rapt in each other, they care\r\nnothing about the sailors, attendants, approaching crowds, and the\r\nrest, at the end of the first act; at the end of the second they\r\nscarcely understand Mark's passionate affection--they only know it is\r\nan enemy of their love; and, finally, they are glad when death frees\r\nthem from life, which means an incessant trouble and interruption to\r\nthem. The tragedy deepens and grows more intense with each successive\r\nscene; each separates them more widely from life and all that life\r\nmeans, until in the last act the divorce is complete. This is the\r\npurpose of the drama: this _is_ the drama....\" When Wagner conceived\r\nTristan he was as fine a master of stage-craft as has ever lived; and\r\ncertainly by very far the finest who ever wrote \"words for music.\" The\r\nfirst scene prepares us to understand clearly and to grasp firmly the\r\nforces that are presently to be let loose and run the drama on to its\r\ntragic dénouement; and after that, scene follows scene with absolute\r\ninevitability.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nDuring Wagner's five years of theorising after quitting Dresden in\r\n1849 he had thought of subjects and written parts of the _Ring_.\r\nTristan is the greatest work he completed. A reservoir full of music\r\nmust have accumulated in his brain; and he seems now to have opened\r\nthe sluices. Never did a more fiery impetuous stream flow from any\r\ncomposer: never was there, in a word, more inspired music. The\r\nprofusion of the material is wonderful, and even more wonderful is the\r\nconcentrated quality of that material. In the _Ring_ and\r\n_Parsifal_--as in _Lohengrin_ and _Tannhäuser_--there are _longueurs_;\r\nin _Tristan_ there are none: not a bar can be cut; there is not a bar\r\nthat does not hold us. In a paradoxical mood, or irritated, by being\r\nobstinately, wilfully, stupidly regarded as one of the trade setters\r\nof opera-texts, Wagner declared to Bülow that \"one thing is certain, I\r\nam not a musician.\" This has been interpreted as meaning, \"I am no\r\nmusician,\" whereas, of course, he meant he was very much more than a\r\nmusician: which, in a sense, he was. He was not a greater genius than\r\nMozart and Beethoven, who had nothing of the dramatist in them, nor\r\nthan Shakespeare, who was not, technically at least, a musician; but\r\nhe was something different from both species of men--a dramatist who\r\ncould not get the drama out of himself without the aid of music, and a\r\nmusician who could not beat out his music without the aid of drama.\r\nMusic and drama had simultaneous birth in the case of _Tristan_, and\r\nit is difficult to describe and criticise them separately. There is no\r\nother way of doing it, however, and as the drama is the structural\r\nfoundation I have dealt with it first; but the music is of not less\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nMany readers will remember how, not so very many years ago, a common\r\ncriticism of Wagner's music was that it possessed no melody. Happily\r\nat this time of day there is no need to try to disprove this; for when\r\nwe hear the first act of _Tristan_ the first thing to strike us must\r\nsurely be its richness in melody. It teems with tunes--it is an\r\nunbroken tune from the first note of the prelude to the last chord of\r\nthe act. At times we feel the terrific energy as something that might\r\neasily grow wearying to the nerves, and then comes a long song, such\r\nas Brangaena's remonstrance to Isolda, which is a sheer delight to the\r\near and prepares us for the next dramatic outburst. That is the first\r\nthing to strike us; the next is the perfect skill with which the sound\r\nand feeling, the very breath, of the sea are kept ever present. The\r\nbody of the music is made up of music growing out of the passage in\r\nthe sailor-song (_g_); this goes through a hundred transformations,\r\nand is put to a hundred uses as the action progresses; and the swing\r\nand lilt of it never fail to conjure up a vision of smooth rollers and\r\nthe sea-wind filling the sail and driving the ship fast towards\r\nCornwall. It takes one shape when Brangaena tells Isolda that they\r\nwill land before evening; and in nearly the same shape it returns when\r\nBrangaena goes to bid Tristan enter her mistress's presence; in the\r\nmeantime lengthy passages have been woven from it during Isolda's\r\nfirst angry outburst; in one form or another it is worked again and\r\nagain, always conveying just the feeling of the moment, yet never\r\nlosing its original colour. Wagner's mastery of the art of pictorial\r\nsuggestion, while faithfully and logically expressing, explaining and\r\nenforcing the actors' emotion, is here at its supremest height. In the\r\n_Ring_ he often wrote purely pictorial music for a few pages with\r\nsimple, almost speaking, parts for the singers, trusting, as he well\r\ncould, to the stage situation explaining itself and making its own\r\neffect. But the burning passion with which _Tristan_ is filled\r\nnecessitated another mode of treatment, a mode which Wagner alone\r\namongst musicians had the art and strength to employ. Other\r\ncomposers, notably Weber and Mendelssohn, had given the world grand\r\nscenic music; but where they left off Wagner began. Their picture is\r\nan end in itself: Wagner's are settings for the dramatic action.\r\n\r\nThere are not many leitmotivs in _Tristan_, and they are used for\r\nideas and passions--never for personages. Tristan, Isolda, Mark,\r\nBrangaena and Kurvenal have none of them a representative theme. Each\r\nact has its own themes--a multitude of them--each carried through the\r\nact in which it appears, and nowhere else employed; only (_a_) and\r\n(_h_) appear throughout the opera. Some small use is made of (_c_),\r\nbut once the poisoning episode is done with the subject ceases to have\r\nany significance. That marked (_h_) is of great importance. Its effect\r\nis terrible when Isolda is enticing, or compelling, Tristan to drink\r\nthe cup. The sailors break in with their \"Yo, heave ho!\" and Tristan,\r\nbewildered, asks, \"Where are we?\" Isolda, with sinister purpose,\r\nreplies, \"Near to the end!\" The intense originality, due to their\r\nbeing closely allied to the dramatic meaning, of all the themes should\r\nbe noted: only one, the second part of the love-theme (_a_), suggests\r\nany other music. It is reminiscent of the introduction of Beethoven's\r\nSonata \"Pathétique,\" and, after all, the phrase was not new when\r\nBeethoven employed it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nWe have seen in this first act, if not the birth of love, at any rate\r\nthe avowal. The scene is laid on the sea, fresh, breezy, salt,\r\nbracing, suggestive of infinite energy and possibilities. We are now\r\nto witness it in its ripeness: not by any means a healthy ripeness,\r\nbut ecstatic to the point of frenzy, burning to the point of madness,\r\ntumultuous, unbridled passion and lust; and, as these violent delights\r\nhave violent ends, ending in tragedy. When the curtain rises the\r\npicture is in exquisite contrast with that presented in the first act.\r\nWell did Wagner know the value of the scenic environment; he always\r\ngot it just and true and, from the artistic point of view, in sympathy\r\nwith the prevailing emotion. The demands on the scene-painters and\r\nstage-machinists are nothing in _Tristan_ compared with those made in\r\nthe _Ring_ and _Parsifal_; but when the directions are complied with,\r\nas I understand they occasionally are (I have seen them carried out\r\nonce), nothing more gorgeously effective can be dreamed of. Instead of\r\nthe morning air of Act I we have a warm summer night in a luxuriant\r\ngarden; on the left is a castle with steps leading up to the door, and\r\na burning torch makes the dark night darker; trees at the back and on\r\nthe right are massed black against the dark sky; in the centre under a\r\ntree there is a seat for the convenience of the lovers. At the very\r\nfirst glance we are taken into the atmosphere for a great\r\nlove-scene--the most magnificent love-scene ever conceived; and also\r\nwe are carried ages back--back to a time that never existed. This\r\nold, world-old feeling, this sense of the past, is present to some\r\ndegree in the first act; but here the music makes it of overwhelming\r\npower, and just as in the first act the sea is always present, so here\r\nthe sense of a remote period is never allowed to leave us.\r\n\r\nWhen the first chord of the brief, passionate introduction was first\r\nheard in a theatre nearly half a century ago, it sent a shudder\r\nthrough every professional class-room in every conservatoire in\r\nEurope, and the theme is perhaps the most important in the act (_j_);\r\nand the cutting, almost raucous chord lets us know at once that big\r\ndoings are at hand. Another theme follows--one of impatience and sick\r\nanxiety: it is that which is played again when Isolda, hardly able to\r\ncontain herself while waiting for Tristan, wildly waves her\r\nhandkerchief, beckoning to him. Another and most lovely melody is\r\nheard (_k_); and then some of the love-music which is played when he\r\ndoes come and rushes to her arms. This leads straight to the rising of\r\nthe curtain, and Brangaena is seen on the steps by the torch, keeping\r\nwatch and listening to the horns of a hunting party; the sounds are\r\ngrowing fainter in the distance.\r\n\r\nIsolda enters, and Brangaena vainly tries to dissuade her from meeting\r\nTristan. This night hunt, she swears, is a scheme of Melot's for the\r\nbetrayal of Tristan, his foe. Isolda laughs. Melot is Tristan's\r\nfriend, and the night hunt was arranged that the lovers might meet.\r\nThey dispute to some of Wagner's loveliest melodies. The theme (_k_)\r\nflows along as an accompaniment, and becomes more prominent when\r\nIsolda says she can no longer hear the horns; she hears the gentle\r\nplash of the brook running from the fountain--as \"in still night alone\r\nit laughs on my ear\"--the party of hunters must be many miles off. The\r\nsignal for Tristan is the extinguishing of the torch, and the music\r\nassociated with this deed now is used again in the last act in another\r\nform. Brangaena prays her mistress not to put it out: it means death,\r\nshe says, and as a sort of subsidiary death-theme this melody is\r\nafterwards used. Isolda is too completely mastered by desire to\r\nlisten. When Brangaena curses herself for having changed the magic\r\ndrinks she is laughed at. To music filled with passion and of perfect\r\nbeauty she says the whole business was arranged by Venus, goddess of\r\nlove, and we hear yet another love-theme (_l_); then to the crash of\r\nwhat we must call the torch-theme, blent with the death-theme from Act\r\nI, she throws down the torch and frantic with impatience awaits her\r\nlover.\r\n\r\nHe enters, and after some delirious pages not to be described in words\r\nthe pair fall to talk in Schopenhauerian terminology about the light\r\nand the dark. But the passion never goes out of the music. On the\r\ncontrary, it grows in intensity, for the madness of the meeting is\r\nnothing to the white-hot passion we get later; and in spite of the\r\nterminology the meaning of both Tristan and Isolda is perfectly clear.\r\nLight has been, and is, the enemy of their love; in the garish light\r\nof day Tristan, filled with daylight dreams of ambition, first made\r\nover to Mark, so to speak, his rights in Isolda; \"is there a pain or a\r\nwoe that does not awaken with daylight?\" he asks; and now, declared\r\nlovers, they may only meet in the dark: during the day they must be\r\ndistant strangers. They know whither fate is driving them: Isolda has\r\nsaid as much to Brangaena: \"she may end it ... whatsoe'er she make me,\r\nwheresoe'er take me, hers am I wholly, so let me obey her solely.\"\r\nThey are embodiments of sheer passion; love is the most selfish of\r\npassions, and placed as they are, realising that they live only for\r\nand in that passion, they have no thought for any one else, regarding\r\nthe outer world, the world of daylight, as their foe. Isolda does not\r\nhesitate to remind Tristan of his perfidy in the days of light; and\r\nhe, far from defending himself, finds it quite sufficient to remark\r\nthat he had not then come under the sway of night: that is, they have\r\nno ordinary human affection for each other. If they had, neither would\r\nlead the other into such danger. Shakespeare did not, could not, make\r\nhis lovers live so entirely in their passion as this: he had no music\r\nto express himself by, and had to speak through human beings. So when\r\nRomeo says, \"let me stay and die,\" Juliet instantly hurries him away.\r\nTristan and Isolda know they are wending to death, and are content.\r\n\r\nTheir feelings subside into soft languor, and then they sing the\r\nsublime hymn to night. Brangaena's voice is heard from the\r\nwatch-tower, warning them of approaching danger; and they heed her\r\nnot. Again she sings to them that the danger is imminent--night is\r\ndeparting; Tristan, resting his head on the bosom of his mistress,\r\nsimply says, \"Let me die thus.\" The catastrophe is at hand. The duet\r\nreaches its glorious climax; Brangaena gives a shriek from her tower;\r\nKurvenal rushes in yelling \"Save yourselves,\" but it is too\r\nlate--Mark, Melot and the other huntsmen come in quickly, and--the\r\ngame is up. The red dawn slowly breaks; Tristan hides Isolda with his\r\ncloak; Melot turns to Mark and says, \"Did I not tell you so?\"--his\r\nruse has succeeded quite well enough. And now follows a scene which\r\nhas proved a stumbling-stock to many.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary dramatist or play-monger would drop the curtain on this\r\ndénouement; and undeniably it would be what is called an effective\r\n\"curtain.\" However, effective curtains were not Wagner's business in\r\nplanning _Tristan_; he had long since passed through that stage. He\r\ncould not after such a curtain--the sort of curtain that ends many an\r\nopera--have carried out the plan of _Tristan_--to show us the lovers\r\nrealising their impossible situation in life and deliberately seeking\r\ndeath as the refuge. Tristan and Isolda care nothing for shame and\r\ndisgrace: they care only for their love, and their love relentlessly\r\ndrives them into their grave. Mark has a great affection for them\r\nboth, and precisely on that account he is their enemy. He begins a\r\nlong expostulation: \"How is it that the two people dearer to him than\r\nall the world have so betrayed his trust?\" It is lengthy, and must\r\nneeds be so; each proof he gives them of his love only more clearly\r\ndefines his real significance and relation to them. Tristan does not\r\nfear Melot: he dreads Mark's affection. He (Tristan) calls out,\r\n\"Daylight phantoms! morning visions, empty and vain--away, begone!\"\r\nbut Mark continues, putting in a dozen ways the same question, \"Why,\r\nwhy have they done this?\" It is not the behaviour of a barbaric king;\r\nbut we must remember that Wagner's Mark is not, and is not intended to\r\nbe, the legendary Mark any more than Tristan and Isolda are the\r\nlegendary Tristan and Isolda: he is the personification of human\r\naffection, a thing to which they, enthralled by elemental love, are\r\nindifferent--detest, indeed, as interfering with their love. When he\r\nends Tristan knows he has no explanation to offer--none that Mark\r\ncould possibly understand: human affection and elemental human passion\r\nare unintelligible to one another. He replies that he cannot answer\r\nMark's \"Why?\" and turning to Isolda asks whether she will follow him\r\nwhither he is now going--the land of eternal night. He, not Mark,\r\nplans his death. Isolda answers straightway that she will follow.\r\nTristan and Melot fight, but Tristan allows his treacherous foe to run\r\nthe sword through him, and he falls. _Then_ we get the curtain;\r\nTristan has done with this world and has started out for another, and\r\nthe drama has taken a second step towards its goal.\r\n\r\nThis, held for long to be bad craftsmanship, is consummate, daring\r\ncraftmanship. _Tristan_ is a drama of spiritual conflicts; and those\r\nwho do not like that sort had better try something by the trade\r\nplaywrights of to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe music of the first act is largely fierce, angry, turbulent, often\r\nbitter music, blent and merging into music expressive of fierce\r\ndesire, the hunger of the man after the woman, of the woman after the\r\nman. There is one moment of sweet longing--the moment after Isolda and\r\nTristan have drunk the fatal potion; but instantly the torrent breaks\r\nforth, and though it is in a way sweet, the sweetness is mixed with\r\nfire; the stream is as a stream of molten lava, scalding, consuming.\r\nThe note of the music to the second act is utterly different; there is\r\nfire, indeed, a golden fire; there is greedy impatience and\r\nrestlessness; but the fire does not scorch nor scald, the impatience\r\nis not despairing, the love is not--as it certainly is in the first\r\nact--that passion which is but one remove from deadly hate. Almost at\r\nthe beginning of the first act Isolda, devoured by a longing for\r\nrevenge, schemed to murder Tristan, and she does not falter in her\r\npurpose until he has taken the drink; the reaction has all the\r\nviolence of a cataclysm; all is delirium; there is not a moment of\r\nhappy lingering over the joy of a possible; new life; there is no time\r\nfor that, no thought of it. All is burning wrath and hate and equally\r\nburning lust and greed for the possession of the beloved one's body.\r\nIn the second act the anger has died out, and in the whirl of the\r\nmusic, though at its maddest, there is a fulness, an assured sense of\r\ncoming satisfaction; and the excitement settles down into long,\r\ndrawn-out, luscious, voluptuous strains as the lovers, held in each\r\nother's arms, exchange the sweet confidences usual (I suppose) on such\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nMusically the act may be regarded--conveniently, though roughly and\r\ncrudely--as a kind of symphony, in four sections which to an extent\r\noverlap. We have section one from the first bar of the prelude to\r\nTristan's entry; section two, the impassioned duet; three, from the\r\nhymn to night until the lovers are discovered; and four, from that\r\npoint to the end. Many of the themes are worked right through, but the\r\nsections vary vastly in colour, atmosphere and feeling. The variety\r\nunified into a completely satisfying whole is astounding. Amongst the\r\nreally great musicians only four possessed the organising brain in\r\nthis degree--Wagner himself, Beethoven, Handel and Bach. This act is\r\neven more completely an organic whole than the first; every part\r\nperforms its functions and retains its individuality, yet all the\r\nparts are co-ordinated. I have seen miraculous pieces of machinery in\r\nwhich each part seemed to be alive and doing its duty independent of\r\nthe others; yet all working together to achieve one purpose. The score\r\nof _Tristan_ is as marvellous--indeed, more so, for the purpose is not\r\na mechanical one, but the expression, with rigid fidelity to truth, of\r\nthe most subtle and exquisite feelings.\r\n\r\nI have said earlier that in evolving his purely musical structures\r\nWagner adopted one plan. He not only used the subjects of his operas\r\nfor the overtures, or (as in the present case) of the preludes to the\r\nacts, but he makes them tell a story dramatically. Merely to use\r\nthemes for an opera as conventional subjects to be treated in symphony\r\nform had been done; but Wagner never dreamed of adopting a form and\r\nimposing it on his material from outside; with him the form is\r\ndetermined by the material and the significance the material bore in\r\nhis mind. This is very different from deliberately writing a symphonic\r\npoem--deliberately sitting down in cold blood and setting to work to\r\nillustrate a story. _That_ method is antithetical to Wagner's; a\r\nsymphonic poem writer is simply a setter of opera texts, one who\r\nfollows with devout care the book of words put before him--with this\r\ndifference, that the opera-writer must, to some extent at least,\r\nconsider his words, his singers, his stage, while the composer of\r\nsymphonic poems can do just as he pleases and consider no one's\r\nconvenience, shortening this section or lengthening that as the\r\nmusical exigencies demand, while making use of some tale or a poem as\r\nan excuse for writing in a form which in itself is unintelligible and\r\nillogical. So far as Wagner could he let music and drama grow up\r\ntogether; then to start with the right atmosphere he took certain\r\nthemes and spun a piece of music from them, letting the themes, as I\r\nhave said, unfold themselves logically and determine the form. The\r\nresult is always a fine piece of music; and thousands of listeners\r\nhave derived artistic enjoyment from the _Mastersingers_ overture,\r\nthe _Lohengrin_ prelude and _Tristan_ prelude without troubling to\r\ntrace the story as it is plainly told. In the prelude to Act II here,\r\nfor example, no one need seek a story, though it is obvious enough.\r\nFirst we have the daylight theme, peremptorily, harshly announced;\r\nthen the impatience of Isolda, then her longing, then her thoughts of\r\nlove and her hopes of fulfilment, and just before the curtain rises\r\nthe crash which accompanies the extinction of the torch.\r\n\r\nI have already alluded to the old-world atmosphere got at once by the\r\nhorn calls and the lovely passage in which Isolda sings of the brook\r\n\"laughing on\" in the still night; but in this first scene, which is by\r\ncomparison a mere introduction to the duet, we find a thousand\r\nbeautiful things. At this period of his life Wagner was by no means so\r\neconomical as he afterwards became; he squandered his pearls with\r\nprodigal hands. In a few pages are enough melodies and themes to set\r\nup a Puccini--or for that matter a Strauss or an Elgar--for life. The\r\nblending of the death-theme with one of the love-themes, when Isolda\r\nspeaks of love's goddess, \"the queen who grants unquailing hearts ...\r\nlife and death she holds in her hands,\" is one of the miracles of\r\nmusic--stern beauty made up of defiance of fate and careless\r\nvoluptuousness. In the very next melody to make its appearance, the\r\nsecond bar after the change to the key of A, we may note what I think\r\nis the first sign of one of the many mannerisms of Wagner's \"third\r\nperiod,\" as we call it--the period extending from _Tristan_ to the\r\nfinishing of the _Ring_ (_Parsifal_ being as the tail to the dog, or\r\nperhaps the tin-kettle tied to the tail). It is the phrase quoted\r\n(_l_). Those five notes of the second bar were to be made to serve\r\nmany purposes hereafter; and the Wagnerites will insist that this was\r\ndone for a high artistic reason. Perhaps it was; but to me it seems\r\nthat it is found so frequently sometimes because Wagner wanted to\r\nutter precisely the same emotion as he had employed it for earlier,\r\nand sometimes because, like all other composers, at times he found his\r\ninvention flagging. In the second scene of this act of _Tristan_ it\r\nplays a conspicuous part, and is indeed one of the most pregnant love\r\nmotives of the drama--perhaps the most prolific of subsidiary themes\r\nand passages.\r\n\r\nThe big duet beats description, and its structure must only be\r\ndiscussed briefly. A figure which forms part of the music played while\r\nIsolda impatiently awaits Tristan is turned into the whirling\r\naccompaniment to impassioned and incoherent exclamations as they first\r\nembrace; then to the seething mass of tone is added (_l_), and\r\ngradually out of chaos and confusion emerges one clean-cut melody\r\nafter another. The daylight-theme which begins the introduction is\r\nProtean in the shapes it assumes, and the emotions, now hot passion,\r\nnow the gentlest tenderness, it is made to express. The ferment\r\nsettles down, and we get the hymn to night and a series of melodies\r\nwhich are love's own voice speaking. The dreamy voluptuousness that\r\npervades these duets comes from songs written by Wagner as studies.\r\nThey were not over highly esteemed by his friends, but he had his\r\nrevenge. This night in the garden--with the black night above and the\r\nblack trees around, the flowers, the musical brooklet, and the voice\r\nof the caller heard at times from the roof--is the greatest thing of\r\nthe kind in all music: in all the arts, I know only the balcony scene\r\nin _Romeo and Juliet_ which may be said to approach it. Melody upon\r\nmelody, delicate and sweet to the ear as the perfume of night flowers\r\nand grasses to the nostrils, floats past; until at last the sheer\r\ndelight of the thing seems to work up the lovers to a state of\r\nheavenly rapture, and in the final verse of the hymn to night they\r\npray only to be removed from the dangers of returning day; and here\r\nthe strains swell to an intensity of yearning for peace quite\r\nunprecedented in music. And, as we know, their prayer is immediately\r\nanswered in a fashion they were hardly prepared for.\r\n\r\nMark's address is deeply touching; and it is odd that when attacked by\r\nMelot Tristan's accents are almost his. The sublime is again touched\r\nwhen Tristan asks Isolda to follow him and in her answer. Melot then\r\nstabs him, and the curtain drops to one of Mark's reproachful phrases\r\nthundering from the orchestra. This, then, is Tristan's answer to\r\nMark's questioning--told in the music, not in the words.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nWho first uttered that immortal piece of nonsense, Love and death are\r\none, I cannot say. The Greek conception of Death as Eros with an\r\ninverted torch is quite different: it is a kind of _Tod als Freund_\r\nidea; we are called out of life by an irresistible force or god, which\r\ngod must be love, else he would not want us. The inverted torch is the\r\nsign that shows whither he calls us. It had a mighty fascination for\r\nmany fine minds of the second-rate sort last century; and judging from\r\nthe phraseology of _Tristan_ it seems to have captured Wagner. He was\r\neverlastingly bewildering himself with cheap catch-phrases which\r\nhappened, through suggestion or otherwise, to stir his emotions. He\r\ntook up one philosophical and political system after another, only to\r\nabandon them in turn; but they left a kind of sediment in his mind,\r\nand one never feels sure that the pellucid stream of his music-drama\r\nwill not the next moment be gritty to the palate with some of this\r\noutworn stuff. The bits of Schopenhauer's broken brickbats embedded in\r\nthe libretto of _Tristan_ serve their turn, though a finer and more\r\npoetical way of saying the same things might have been found. But\r\nWagner did not find that more poetical way, so let us rejoice that\r\nthrough this uncouth lingo Wagner managed to get into a sort of verse\r\nthe idea that night was the friend of Tristan's love and day its\r\nenemy, and that in the end everlasting night is best of all. In his\r\nletters, however, we find him playing with the love and death notion,\r\nthough he must have known that love is not death, but life; that if\r\nlove and death are one, then death and love are also one, and to be in\r\nlove is to be in death, to be dead--which is preposterous: corpses\r\ndon't love. Presently we shall see that Isolda died in a state of\r\nexaltation akin to the state of being in love; but that does not\r\nestablish the thesis. Blake, for hours before he died, shouted till\r\nthe ceiling rang for joy to think that he was soon to be with God:\r\ndoes that prove that mysticism and death are one? Mr. Chamberlain, in\r\nhis exegesis of _Tristan_, will have it that Wagner composed the opera\r\nto demonstrate the truth of a very trite and ridiculous lie. The fact\r\nis, Wagner's was far more a feeling, emotional, imaginative brain than\r\na thinking one, and in the hazy, steamy, overheated thinking part he\r\noften let idle phrases play about without himself firmly grasping\r\ntheir meaning or want of it. Anyhow, if he had done what Mr.\r\nChamberlain and many others say he did, we should have found it in the\r\nlast act. Instead, there is not a word on the subject. Wagner's\r\nthinking might be misty: his dramatic instinct was supremely right and\r\nsure.\r\n\r\nIn the first act Isolda and Tristan enjoy their love only for a few\r\nminutes; the world, daylight, breaks in and separates them. In the\r\nsecond they revel in it for hours; the world, daylight, again\r\nseparates them. In the last the world again breaks in; but Tristan has\r\nalready found his refuge in death, and Isolda, obedient to her\r\npromise, follows him, and they are joined, safe from the annoyances of\r\nthe \"phantoms of the day,\" in \"the impregnable fortress,\" the grave.\r\nThe action, as in the preceding portions of the drama, is of the\r\nsimplest. On his bed of pain and sorrow Tristan lies wounded and\r\nunconscious. Kurvenal has got him away from Mark's court in Cornwall\r\nto his own castle in Brittany; and now he has been brought out into\r\nthe castle yard for coolness and air. It is hot, sultry, close; the\r\nsea in the distance seems to burn; the castle is dilapidated and\r\novergrown with weeds. Kurvenal watches by his master; from outside the\r\nsaddest melody ever conceived is heard on a shepherd's pipe. Presently\r\nthe shepherd looks over the wall and asks how the master fares, does\r\nhe still sleep? If he awakes it will only be to die, replies Kurvenal;\r\nunless the lady leech (Isolda) comes there is no hope. A moment after\r\nTristan comes out of his coma, wanders in his mind a little, but at\r\nlast understands where he is and that Isolda will come. At that news\r\nhe works himself into a condition of unbounded excitement, fancies he\r\nsees the ship bringing Isolda, but at the sound of that sad, droning\r\npipe melody, and when Kurvenal tells him it is a signal that no ship\r\nis yet in sight, he lapses into unconsciousness again. Then he wakes\r\nup, goes over the whole history of his love for Isolda, and faints\r\nonce more; once more he half awakes and as in a dream sees the ship\r\ndecked with flowers speeding over the summer sea. Suddenly the\r\nshepherd strikes in with a lively tune: \"Isolda is at hand,\" cries\r\nKurvenal. \"Hasten to bring her,\" shouts Tristan, and Kurvenal does so.\r\nTristan, left to himself, goes mad for sheer joy, staggers off his\r\ncouch, tears his bandages off so that his wound bleeds afresh, and\r\nIsolda rushes in just in time to catch him in her arms, where he dies\r\nmurmuring \"Isolda.\" She laments over his body and sinks down beside\r\nit. Another alarm is given; Kurvenal barricades the gate; Mark, Melot\r\nand the rest break it down, and there is a terrible hand-to-hand\r\nfight; Kurvenal is run through with a spear, and creeps to his\r\nmaster's side, to die, groping for his hand. Brangaena enters, and she\r\nand Mark try to explain how she has told the whole story of the potion\r\nto Mark; how Mark has come, too late, to unite the lovers. Isolda does\r\nnot listen; presently she rises to sing the matchless death-song; she\r\nsees Tristan before her, smiling, transfigured, his love envelopes her\r\nas in billows; she is his now, at last, for aye; and, exhausted, she\r\nagain sinks down beside Tristan, and dies.\r\n\r\nThere is thus in _Tristan_ next to no action--no more than serves to\r\nturn spiritual forces loose and helps to interpret various spiritual\r\nstates. The spectator is interested, indeed, in the _doings_ of the\r\npeople on the stage only in the first act. Isolda's command to Tristan\r\nto come before her, Tristan's evasions, Kurvenal's rude answer, the\r\nrough gibing bit of sailor chorus, the episode of the two chalices\r\n--the love potion and the poison--the scene between Isolda and Tristan\r\nin which he offers her his sword and tells her to take her revenge by\r\nkilling him forthwith, the drinking, the wild embraces and the arrival\r\nof the ship in port amidst the clatter of triumphant trumpets--such\r\nthings might have been, and were, done by Wagner in his _Tannhäuser_\r\ndays. But consider how little is done in the second act and in the\r\nthird. These two portions of the music-drama are more symphonic than\r\noperatic, and it is small wonder that in the days when good folk\r\nexpected to see opera when they went into an opera-house, they thought\r\nthey had been diddled when they were given _Tristan_ for their money.\r\nIf anything so new and unexpected were sprung upon us to-day we should\r\nraise the same cry as was raised when _Tristan_ was given nearly half\r\na century ago. The introduction opens with a phrase (_m_) of threefold\r\nmeaning. It is clearly derived from the second phrase of the first\r\nlove-theme (_a_, page 274); it is a realistic representation in music\r\nof Tristan's stertorous breathing; it expresses his delirious state of\r\nmind--chiefly, however, in the upward-drifting thirds and fourths with\r\nwhich it ends at each occurrence. Then comes the music associated with\r\nhis suffering and the \"lady leech.\" The whole passage is then\r\nrepeated, and afterwards we get the shepherd's pipe (_n_). This forms\r\nthe prelude, and the music of the short scene with the shepherd is\r\npractically the same. Some new matter is brought in, for dramatic\r\nrather than sheer musical purposes, as Tristan awakens; but the next\r\nsubject that I need call attention to is the noble one which comes in\r\nwhen Kurvenal assures him he is safe in his own castle (_o_). The\r\nwhole of Tristan's subsequent ravings are made up of reminiscences,\r\nmore or less distorted, of various passages out of the first and\r\nsecond acts, as he goes over, as in a dream, his recent life--the\r\nsight of Isolda, the scene on the ship and that in the garden. Another\r\nnew theme to be noted is blazed out by the orchestra when Kurvenal\r\ntells him Isolda has been sent for. When he sinks back exhausted and\r\nno ship is in sight the shepherd's pipe keeps wandering through his\r\nbrain with strange, weird, terrible effect, mixing with fragments of\r\nother themes; he gathers strength, and his despair rises to frenzy as\r\nhe curses himself--\"'Twas I by whom [the draught] was brewed\"--to a\r\nphrase overwhelming in its intensity of expression (_p_), and again\r\ncollapses.\r\n\r\nPresently follow a few pages of perhaps the divinest music to be found\r\nin Wagner's scores, Tristan's dream of Isolda crossing the summer sea.\r\nTo an evenly pulsing gentle accompaniment we hear first the second\r\npart of a love-theme (_q_), then fragments of others, till the point\r\nof supernal, Mozartean beauty is touched at \"full of grace and loving\r\nmildness.\" The pathos of it is almost intolerable: no one could stand\r\nthe strain another second, when after the cry, \"Ah, Isolda, how fair\r\nart thou,\" he rouses himself to anger because Kurvenal cannot see on\r\nthe rolling waters what he with his inner vision sees so bright and\r\nclear. How any one could, even at a first hearing, fail to realize\r\nthat the composer of this sublime passage was by far, infinitely far,\r\nthe mightiest and tenderest composer of opera music who has\r\nlived--this is a phenomenon that passes our comprehension nowadays.\r\nThe scene where the shepherd sounds his pipe to signal the coming of\r\nthe boat, and Tristan, his delight wrought up until it grows into\r\nanguish, goes mad and tears off his bandages, baffles description. It\r\nis made up of the love music of the first and second acts, the\r\nmelodies being metamorphosed in marvellous fashion. At the last he\r\nsees Isolda throwing down the torch as she did in Act II, and as\r\ndarkness comes over his eyes we hear the same music combined with the\r\nlove-themes. There is only one thing of the kind to match Isolda's\r\nlament--Donna Anna's grief over her father's body in _Don Giovanni_.\r\nThe rest of the act is largely made up of music which has been heard\r\nbefore. The death-song is an extended and glorified version of the\r\nhymn to night; and the close is of sad, tragic sweetness. The lovers\r\nare joined together and at peace--but in the everlasting darkness of\r\nthe grave.\r\n\r\nAny one who has heard _Tristan_ a few times will begin to notice that,\r\ndespite the endless variety of the music, it possesses an odd\r\nhomogeneity. After hearing it fifty or a hundred times one begins to\r\nfeel it to be comparable--if such a comparison could be made--to an\r\nelaborate oration delivered in one breath. The whole thing, complete\r\nin every detail, must (one thinks) have come bodily into the\r\ncomposer's mind in one inconceivable moment of inspiration and\r\ninsight. Of course we know it was not so. A god may think a world into\r\nbeing in that way: a mortal requires time and unflagging energy to\r\nproduce a masterpiece. We know that Wagner incorporated his own\r\nstudies in his masterpiece; we can see how theme is evolved from\r\ntheme. But the unity is so complete that if some sketches were to come\r\nto light showing that the last form of some of the music was in\r\nexistence before the portions from which it seems to be evolved, I\r\nshould not be in the least surprised, so perfect is the unity, so\r\ninevitably does every note fall into its proper place to express the\r\nfeeling of the occasion. I take it that when he drafted the words he\r\nhad before him a prophetic shadow of what the music was to be; and\r\nwhen he came to compose, the uninterrupted white heat of inspiration\r\nand enormous cerebral energy and intellectual grip of his matter, and\r\nthe boundless invention which provided that matter for him, so to\r\nspeak, so that he had only to pick it up ready made, enabled him to\r\nmake that more or less dim, prophetic shadow a living, concrete\r\nreality. Never, from the first bar to the last, does the inspiration\r\nfail him; there is not a phrase that says less, or says it less\r\nadequately than the situation demands, than he has led us to expect.\r\nOld Spohr, when he heard _Tannhäuser_, though his ears rebelled\r\nagainst the unaccustomed discords, spoke about the Olympian\r\ninspiration and energy he felt in the work; and this criticism--and\r\nvery just and fine criticism it was: as just and fine as it was\r\nunexpected from an old-world musician such as Spohr--is equally\r\napplicable to _Tristan_. In its power and perfection it seems the\r\nhandiwork of one of the gods. The very truth of every phrase, and the\r\nfulness of utterance with which every phrase expresses the emotion of\r\nthe moment, has given rise to a common delusion or absurdity: that in\r\nthe Wagnerian opera every phrase is evolved or developed out of the\r\nprevious one. If Wagner ever thought of adopting such an insane\r\nprocedure he would have been puzzled to know how and where to start.\r\nHe might, perhaps, have evolved the first from the last, and thus got\r\na perfect rounded whole--a serpent with its tail in its mouth. As a\r\nmatter of prosaic, or poetical, fact, Wagner, in all his work,\r\nincessantly introduces fresh matter, and dozens of themes appear, are\r\nworked out, and disappear entirely.\r\n\r\nNow, when all this overgrowth of rubbishy comment is being swept away,\r\nand those who contemned Wagner are disappearing with those who\r\nbattened on him and his memory, _Tristan and Isolda_ remains, a\r\nworld-masterpiece, the most powerful, beautiful, sweet and tender\r\nembodiment to be found in any art of elemental human love in all its\r\nsplendour, loveliness, fearfulness, terror and utter selfishness.\r\nThousands of years hence, when Europe has sunk under the waves and\r\nfresh continents have arisen, perhaps a stray copy by hazard preserved\r\nin the Fiji Islands will come to light, will be deciphered by pundits,\r\nand a new race will see in it a primitive but consummate work of art,\r\nand the pundits will argue themselves black in the face about the name\r\nof the composer, whether he was Wagner or another man of the same\r\nname. In the meantime millions of our epoch will have understood it,\r\nloved it, and seen in it a thousand times more than we see in it\r\nto-day, and many thousand times more than I could say in the preceding\r\npages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nBy way of a footnote to this chapter I may be allowed to add a few\r\nwords about the smaller characters. All that Wagner took from the old\r\nlegends was the suggestion for the two lovers who sinned and perished\r\nfor their sin. Crudely or coarsely, gentlemanly (as in Tennyson),\r\nrefined and spiritualized, that idea is the central idea of every form\r\nof the tale. To these two people Wagner added Brangaena and Kurvenal,\r\nand, taking only the name of King Mark, he created a new personage,\r\nunlike any of the older versions of the man, necessary for the\r\nexposition of his idea. Brangaena is the most difficult part to sing\r\nand act, and it is also the most grateful to the actress. She has not\r\na phrase that is not beautiful, from her first dozen bars to her last\r\nrecitative. Kurvenal has his song in the first act and scarcely\r\nappears again until the last, when all his music is of an unspeakable\r\npathos. His phrase to Tristan, \"The wounds from which you languish\r\nhere all shall end their anguish,\" is as touching in its rough,\r\nuncouth way as a hound licking the hand of its dead master. That is\r\nall Kurvenal is--a faithful human dog done in artistic form; and it\r\nrequires a very great artist to interpret it. David Bispham's\r\nimpersonation remains in my memory as the greatest I have seen. Mark's\r\nreproaches in the second act, and his utter grief in the third, are\r\nalso very hard to render. In fact, only fine opera singers can take\r\nany of these parts without coming to grief. The invisible sailor must\r\nbe able to sing beautifully; the shepherd must both act and sing with\r\nno little skill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n'THE MASTERSINGERS OF NUREMBERG'\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe next period of Wagner's life, from the date of finishing\r\n_Tristan_, 1859, till King Ludwig sent for him, 1864, was stormy. The\r\nstruggles and endless disappointments made of him the somewhat hard\r\nand embittered Wagner of later years. The constant battles, the few\r\nvictories and the many disappointments must be related in my next\r\nchapter, as it is simpler and easier for the author, if not the\r\nreader, to consider the _Mastersingers of Nuremberg_ immediately after\r\n_Tristan_. A few facts may be mentioned now to enable us to place the\r\nsecond opera in its true chronological order. The _Nibelung's Ring_\r\nwas still in abeyance; _Tristan_ finished, Wagner, in search of means\r\nof subsistence--the patience and indeed the means of his friends fast\r\ngiving out--undertook a series of concert trips, going to Brussels,\r\nParis, St. Petersburg, Moscow, Marienfeld, Leipzig and Vienna. In 1861\r\nhis last hopes of a Paris success with _Tannhäuser_ were extinguished;\r\nhis concerts up till then had resulted only in an increasing burden of\r\ndebt; his domestic existence was unendurable; things were as bad as\r\nbad could be. So he sat down and wrote his only comedy. It was not a\r\nsimple case of \"tasks in hours of insight willed can be through hours\r\nof gloom fulfilled.\" The _Mastersingers_ had been sketched, as we\r\nknow, in 1845; but the new work was a change, in that he created the\r\ncharacter of Hans Sachs afresh, and the opera became an entirely\r\ndifferent thing. He himself gave an account of the joy with which he\r\nworked at it, incidentally proving the truth of his assertion that he\r\nwas a \"wholly [creative] artist.\" He was not built to be happy in the\r\nouter world, but in his world of art he was content; in the outer\r\nworld he might have an hour of felicity and months of misery, but\r\ngiven a chance of settling down for a while to his operas he at once\r\nbecame and remained cheerful. Fate did not will that in the case of\r\nthe _Mastersingers_ his contentment should endure any length of time.\r\nNo sooner was his text written than he had to set out on his travels\r\nagain, hunting his daily food from land to land. It was not until 1862\r\nthat he began the music; not until 1867 did he get it finished, and in\r\nthe interval many things tragic and other, had occurred. These, I say,\r\nwill occupy us presently.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century there flourished in Nuremberg, as in many\r\nanother city, a guild of minstrels--at once poets and musicians. The\r\nname of Hans Sachs is familiar to us all, but not his verse; and as\r\nfor his music, it has gone down the winds. After composing\r\n_Tannhäuser_, Wagner thought of doing what Germans call a comic\r\npendant to that tragedy; though what there is in the _Mastersingers_\r\nthat hangs from _Tannhäuser_ I beg the reader not to ask me. There is\r\nthis similarity: the central scene of each is a minstrel-contest;\r\nthere is this dissimilarity: one opera is tragic in spirit and the\r\nother comic in spirit. Beyond this there is no connection, whether of\r\nresemblance or of contrast, between the two. The plan was not\r\ndeveloped in 1845, the obvious real reason being that Wagner felt the\r\nwant of a great central figure, Sachs being originally not more than a\r\nbenevolent heavy father. When he had created a soul for this Sachs he\r\nwent ahead and wrote the poem.\r\n\r\nAll that it is necessary to know of the plot may be briefly told in a\r\nskeleton form. One of the mastersingers, Pogner, dissatisfied with the\r\nprizes usually given at the competitions, has decided to grant his\r\ndaughter Eva in marriage to the winner of the next. There are cases on\r\nrecord where such an offer has had the effect of reducing the number\r\nof entries--as when in a later age Matheson and Handel would not\r\ncompete for the position of organist because one of the conditions was\r\nthat the successful man must marry the retiring organist's daughter.\r\nThere is no cup of joy without its drop of bitterness, but Handel and\r\nMatheson evidently thought the bitter outdid the sweet. In the\r\n_Mastersingers_, however, the lady is all that is attractive, and\r\ngoodly sport is expected. Hans Sachs himself, though past middle-age,\r\nloves her, and might well hope to win; Beckmesser, another master of\r\nthe guild, means to do his best; and a young knight, Walther von\r\nStolzing, has just become infatuated with her and she with him. He\r\ncannot strive in the contest, however, not being a master; and when he\r\nsubmits to a trial the guild rejects him with scorn. Things have\r\narrived at this point at the end of the first Act. In the next,\r\nWalther and Eva, desperate, resolve to fly under cover of darkness;\r\nSachs overhears them planning and sings a curious sort of\r\nwarning-song, letting them know that he is on the look-out and will\r\nprevent the elopement; Beckmesser comes to serenade Eva, and David, an\r\napprentice, thinks he has come after _his_ (David's) sweetheart and\r\nfalls to fisticuffs with him; there is a street row, amidst which Eva\r\nescapes into her father's house, while Sachs pulls Walther into his.\r\nIn the third Act Eva, who has already told Sachs quite plainly enough\r\nthat if only a master may win her, and Walther cannot become a master,\r\nshe prefers him to any other, practically repeats her hint. But\r\nWalther has composed another song and Sachs has devised a scheme: if\r\nWalther sings his song he is certain to be the victor, and Sachs has\r\ndetermined that by hook or by crook he must sing it. Beckmesser grabs\r\nthe song, under the impression it is by Sachs; Sachs, without\r\ncommitting himself, tells him to make use of it at the contest if he\r\ncan. The people gather to watch and hear and judge; Beckmesser makes a\r\nmuddle of the song and is laughed off the scene; then Sachs pleads\r\nWalther's case, and he is allowed, though not a master, to sing. He\r\ntriumphs, and by one stroke is admitted to the guild and wins the\r\nprize. Virtually the play ends here. Sachs' winding-up address can\r\nonly be dealt with in connection with the music.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe personality, the soul, of Sachs, its conflict with itself, its\r\nvictory over itself and renunciation--undoubtedly Wagner felt this to\r\nbe the centre of the action of the play, and undoubtedly without it he\r\ncould never have gained the impulse to write the drama at all. It\r\ngives the note of seriousness, even sadness, without which all humour\r\nis the crackling of thorns under the pot, without which the play would\r\nbe farce with a trite love adventure thrown in. We may grant that, and\r\nthen ask ourselves whence came the impulse to work the thing up into\r\none of the longest of Wagner's operas. The impulse was the vision of\r\nold Nuremberg--a vision as indissolubly blent with music as was the\r\nvision of the river and the swan with the music of _Lohengrin_. One\r\nmay say truly that once the germ of the dramatic action was in\r\nWagner's brain he needed the musico-pictorial inspiration of the\r\nscenic environment and atmosphere before the thing took final shape\r\nand he could compose the music. He says explicitly this was so in the\r\ncase of the _Dutchman_; in _Tannhäuser_ it is perhaps a little less\r\nobviously the case. But even in that second of the great operas we\r\nneed only read his directions for the right performing of it to see of\r\nwhat importance to him were the different scenes--the hot, steaming\r\ncave of Venus, the fresh spring morning by the roadside, the great\r\nhall of song--about which he was very particular--the autumn woods in\r\nthe last act. In his letters to Uhlig this comes out very plainly: for\r\ninstance, he gives as his reason for cutting down the finale of the\r\nlast act that it was impossible at Dresden to get a glorious sunrise,\r\nwith which the work should end. I have already laid sufficient stress\r\non the true source of _Lohengrin_; in _Tristan_ adequate and\r\nappropriate scenery is absolutely demanded to sustain the atmosphere;\r\nand here, in the _Mastersingers_, music and a series of pictures go\r\ntogether, and the pictures seem to inspire the music--or rather, music\r\nand pictures are parts of the first inner vision.\r\n\r\nMediæval Nuremberg, with its thousand gable-ends, its fragrant\r\nlime-trees and gardens, its ancient customs, its processions of the\r\nguilds and crafts, its watchman with his horn and lantern, calling the\r\nhour, its freshness and quaint loveliness by day and its sweetness on\r\nsoft summer nights--it is these Wagner employed all his superb\r\nmusico-pictorial art to depict; they are the background to the purely\r\nhuman element of the play, and at the same time they help to express\r\nthat element. If the _Mastersingers_ was a little less successful as a\r\nwork of art we should still have to regard it as an amazing _tour de\r\nforce_. The opera is far too great for that term--one at once of\r\npraise and of reproach. The music is full of the spirit of a past\r\nworld; but the feeling of that world is not got by the use of\r\nartificially archaic phrases or harmonies. Kothner's reading of the\r\nrules of correct minstrelsy is one of the exceptions, and the\r\nnight-watchman's crying of the hour is another; but these, as Lamb\r\nsaid of Coleridge's philosophic preaching, are \"only his fun.\" The\r\nmelodies are often quite Weberesque in contour; the harmonies are\r\neither plain work-a-day ones or modern--so modern that no one had used\r\nthem before. Nor it is by the sadness of the music alone that he gains\r\nhis end: some of the merriest scenes belong, by reason of the music,\r\nto mediæval times. By his art, the intensity of his feeling for those\r\ntimes, and the fidelity with which he could express every shade of\r\nfeeling, he conjures up this vision out of the dead and dusty past,\r\nmakes the dead and dusty past live again, takes us clean into it and\r\nkeeps us there a whole evening without for a moment letting the spell\r\nbe broken. It is significant that the very title he gave his work is a\r\nperemptory warning to us of what to expect: it is not _Hans Sachs_,\r\nnor _Walther von Stolzing_, nor even the _Mastersinger_, etc., but in\r\nthe plural form, the _Mastersingers of Nuremberg_. This is not to cast\r\ndoubt on Wagner's sincerity when he declared that he only got the\r\ncreative impulse to go on with his work when he had conceived Sachs as\r\nSachs now stands: it is only to say that his extraordinary sense of\r\ncolour, atmosphere, and his historical sense, led him to do much more\r\nthan he thought he was doing and perhaps realized he had done.\r\n\r\nThe overture as plainly as the title of the opera proclaims the\r\ncomposer's purpose: it sums up the solid and pompous old burghers, the\r\nimpudent apprentices, the love of Walther and Eva, and says nothing\r\nabout Sachs. As an afterthought, in fact, Sachs is left for the\r\nprelude to the third act. As a piece of music, detachable from the\r\nopera, and by no means an integral part of it as is the case with the\r\n_Tristan_ prelude, the overture transcends every other work of\r\nWagner's. As a contrapuntal feat it remains, with some of Bach's organ\r\nfugues and Bach's and Handel's choruses, a veritable miracle of\r\nmusical art--not of ingenuity alone, for each separate fibre in the\r\nmusical web has character and combines with the other fibres to\r\nproduce an ensemble of overwhelming strength and beauty. The energy of\r\nthe thing is almost superabundant; the gorgeous colouring is dazzling;\r\nand every minutest fibre of it lives. The first theme is another\r\nlandmark in musical history. The harmonisation is extraordinary, not\r\nonly for its gigantic strength, but for the free employment of\r\nchromatics that do not weaken it: in fact, chromatic harmony is so\r\nemployed throughout the _Mastersingers_ that it sounds diatonic.\r\nThroughout _Tristan_ and in the Venusberg music of _Tannhäuser_\r\nchromatic harmony is put into the service of passion; but here we have\r\nmusic that is as solid, equable, serene as a Handel eight-part chorus.\r\nWith consummate skill the stream of music is, so to say, led on to the\r\ntheme that always accompanies the mastersingers, as distinguished from\r\nthe citizens, of Nuremberg; next Walther's song is extemporised upon\r\n(no other phrase serves) for a couple of minutes--the most passionate\r\npage in the opera--and after that come the apprentices. We shall\r\npresently observe that Wagner in this opera made light-hearted fun of\r\nthe pundits, and as if to show them that he had a right to do so he\r\nplayed with the devices that to them were a very serious business\r\nindeed. What to them was an end--I mean all the tricks of\r\ncounterpoint--was to him a means to expression: more expressive music\r\nwas never dreamed of in a musician's imagination, and at the same time\r\nhe accomplished with ease part-writing that the most skilful\r\ncontrapuntists could only perform by labouring long at expressionless,\r\nstale old themes first contrived before the Flood to \"work well,\" as\r\nthe phrase goes. The apprentices' music, then, is an instance: Wagner\r\ntakes the solid burghers' theme and writes it in notes one-quarter the\r\nlength, so that it sounds four times as fast. The effect is\r\nunexpectedly droll, the music skips about in the most irresponsible\r\nway, and (when one knows what it is meant for) depicts the gambols of\r\nthe herd of young rascals who come on the scene in the first act. This\r\ncontrivance, called \"diminution,\" is resorted to again presently when\r\nthe mastersingers' theme, in notes of half the length, is used as an\r\naccompaniment to a combination of Walther's song and the burghers'\r\nmusic. There is a good deal of _tour de force_ about this, but the\r\nresult justifies the means: the superb melody swings over the\r\nponderous bass, both melody and bass singing out clear and strong\r\namidst an animated, bustling and whirling sea of merry tunes.\r\n\r\nComposers generally left the composition of the overture till last--as\r\nit were doing the thing only because an overture had to be\r\nwritten--but Wagner knew the importance of his work and must have\r\ncomposed this one very early; for in 1862, five years earlier than\r\nthe completion of the opera and six before the first representation,\r\nhe directed a performance of it in the Gewandhaus at Leipzig. He never\r\nwas a favourite in that stodgy city, the headquarters of musical\r\nJudea, and the audience is said to have been scanty. In fact, he\r\nhimself said that, although he gave concerts only to gain money, he\r\nnever made any profits until he went to Russia. The audience, if\r\nsmall, was enthusiastic. But, without entertaining any delusions about\r\npersecution and the deliberate ignoring of his work, it is easy to see\r\nthat such music as this could not possibly be understood at once.\r\nThough this overture is clarity itself to our ears, it is terribly\r\ncomplicated, and the style was absolutely new. I doubt whether the\r\nplayers quite knew, as our players know now, what they were doing; for\r\nhere was something quite alien from the patchwork of four-bar measures\r\nwhich constituted the ordinary symphonic novelty at that time. There\r\nwas no \"form\"--no statement of first and second subject, no\r\nworking-out section measured off with compass and ruler, no\r\nrecapitulation and coda; and mid-nineteenth century ears and brains\r\nwere utterly baffled. The thematic luxuriance, the richness of the\r\npart-weaving, the blazing brilliance of the colouring--these were a\r\nmere vexation; and the volcanic energy was quickly found exhausting.\r\nWorst of all, even in those days there were Wagnerites. Chief amongst\r\nthem was Wagner. A Wagnerite is a person who devotes his days and his\r\nnights to raising a stone wall of misunderstanding between the\r\ncomposer's music and the ears of the audience; and at this game Wagner\r\nwas an adept. The generation rising up to-day finds it hard to see\r\nwhat an earlier generation found to carp at in Wagner's music; in\r\nfifty years' time the war between Wagnerites and anti-Wagnerites will\r\nbe inexplicable, and the story of it may not improbably be regarded as\r\ngrossly exaggerated, if not a pure myth. Men of my generation know\r\nvery well it was an ugly and stupid reality; we know also it was\r\nbrought about by the Wagnerites. Not Wagner's \"discords,\" his \"lack of\r\nmelody,\" his \"formlessness\" and so on hindered an almost instantaneous\r\nappreciation of his music, but the \"explanations\" of the music. Things\r\neasy to grasp, many things as old as the eternal hills, were\r\n\"explained\" as being terribly difficult, and the world was told of the\r\n\"revolution\" Wagner had brought about in music. No wonder many good\r\nfolks were distrustful; no wonder many would not listen to it,\r\nbelieving the Wagnerites' claim that their master had rejected all the\r\nrules observed by previous composers. Wagner's own account of this\r\noverture is enough to turn a man's hair grey and to break a woman's\r\nheart. Had he only written a good deal less prose--or none at all!\r\n\r\nThe opera is entirely a praise of pure, true song, and is the longest\r\nsong in existence. Nearly all the characters are supposed to be\r\nsingers; in the first act are two beautiful pieces of song; in the\r\nsecond a fine song saves the young lovers from making fools of\r\nthemselves and a bad song provokes a street riot; the opera winds up\r\nwith the presentation of the prize to the composer of a song. If there\r\nmust be a hero in the opera that song is the hero. We hear snatches of\r\nit from time to time, and at the last it comes out in all its glory\r\nwith a choral accompaniment. There are interludes, of course--Wagner\r\nknew better than to cloy our ears with sweetness too long sustained;\r\nbut the whole work must be regarded as one great song, of which the\r\nclear-cut songs interspersed are parts. Even in the 'sixties, when\r\nnothing later than _Lohengrin_ was known, the charge was brought\r\nagainst the composer that his music was unvocal and could not be sung\r\n--the _Mastersingers_ was his answer. The overture leads into the\r\nfirst piece of song, the chorale that forms a vital part of the\r\nmusical texture as the opera proceeds. We see part of the inside of a\r\nchurch and Walther making signs to Eva, who is clearly not attending\r\nto her devotions. Most readers are aware that in Germany it was the\r\ncustom for the organist to play short interludes between the lines of\r\nhymn-tunes--a preposterous trick, but one which Bach put to a splendid\r\nuse; and here Wagner transfers these interludes to the orchestra and\r\nmakes them serve as a voice for Walther's feelings on seeing Eva for a\r\nsecond time: on the first occasion, the day before, they had fallen in\r\nlove with each other. The next real song-music begins to flow with the\r\nentry of the singers' guild; but meantime there has been some music of\r\nthe sort we have noticed as forming a large part of _Tristan_.\r\nRecitative--often broken sentences and mere ejaculations--merges\r\nimperceptibly into passionate melody, and this in its turn gives way\r\nto recitative, the whole thing being held together by the fairly\r\ncontinuous flow of the orchestral accompaniment. The apparatus, in a\r\nword, is precisely the same as in _Tristan_. In this first scene\r\nWalther pleads his suit with Eva and her maidservant Magdalena; then\r\nwe have the apprentices, amongst them Magdalena's sweetheart David, to\r\nsome rollicking choruses and to their own music--the burghers' music\r\nplayed four times as fast; and next David instructs Walther in the\r\nrules to be observed if he wishes to compose a master-song and to be\r\nadmitted to the guild. Here Wagner indulges in positively uproarious\r\nsatire of the pseudo-classicism and the school harmony, counterpoint\r\nand \"composition\" of the nineteenth century; and the music is not less\r\nludicrous than the words. It is a parody of the very kind of music\r\nWagner wrote in his _Rienzi_ days, with sneers at the Jewish composers\r\nof psalms. Walther, in wrath, disgust and despair, cries out that he\r\nwants to learn how to sing, not to cobble boots.\r\n\r\nThe entry of the masters is a scene that only Wagner could have\r\nexecuted. A stream of Mozartian melody ripples on as the men shake\r\nhands and go through the conventional business of the gathering of\r\npeople on the stage: what in the operas of the day--a dozen instances\r\nmight be mentioned--is wearisome stodge is here turned into a thing of\r\nsurpassing beauty. These shifting shadows of the old world become for\r\nthe moment alive; yet we see them as though across the centuries\r\nthrough the magical web of music. The steady swaying motion of the\r\naccompaniment--and, of course, the whole charm lies in the\r\naccompaniment--has a curious resemblance to the duet of the Don and\r\nZerlina in the first act of _Don Giovanni_, though Mozart's score is\r\nsimplicity itself compared with this. This use of a kind of rocking\r\nfigure led many younger musicians astray; and I make a comparison\r\nbetween their use of it and Wagner's with no intention of being odious\r\nto any one, but to show exactly where Wagner's superiority lay. Take a\r\ncomposer of very fine genius, Anton Dvoràk, and look at a beautiful\r\nnumber (beautiful in a primitive, almost savage way) in his _Stabat\r\nMater_, the _Eia, mater_. The theme of this (_a_, page 318) is a\r\ndescendant, with several of Wagner's subjects, and three or four at\r\nleast of Sir Edward Elgar's, of the opening of Handel's \"Ev'ry\r\nvalley.\" Dvoràk's form of it is quite original, but he never gets any\r\nfurther: he cannot develop his subject. He adds an echoing, antiphonal\r\nphrase; but even with this help he gets no further. At a first hearing\r\nof this really very sincere and for moments entrancing work one hopes\r\nfor the best at the end of the first dozen bars; but better is not to\r\nbe. The theme becomes an accompanying figure to some not very engaging\r\nchoral passages: in the invention of the theme the whole force seems\r\nto have gone out of the man: he has no power of achieving a climax\r\nsave by the addition of instruments: a growing climax to him means\r\nnothing more than growing noise, and the grand climax is only the\r\nnoisiest passage of all. The one figure is repeated over and over\r\nagain, always with more instruments, until at last the complete\r\nbattery of the modern orchestra is hard at it, and Dvoràk's resources\r\nare at an end. Now look at our mighty Wagner. He takes the simplest of\r\nfigures (_b_), plays with it, with seeming carelessness, for a while,\r\nthen adds what is, technically, a counterpoint to it; he develops that\r\ncounterpoint, adds melody on melody--always keeping his figure going,\r\nthat the thing may be held together--until, after a rich and ever\r\nbroadening and deepening tide of music, he gets his climax at the\r\npredetermined dramatic moment; and the climax does not consist of\r\nnoise, but is in the stuff of the music. Development, real\r\ndevelopment, is not mere juggling with musical subjects, but\r\ncontinuous invention of melodies, and the driving-force behind it is\r\nthe ceaseless craving of the spirit to express itself fully.\r\n\r\nEven more striking than this instance is the treatment of a figure\r\nheard first when Pogner announces to the assembled mastersingers his\r\nintention of giving his daughter Eva as the prize in next day's\r\ncontest. \"To-morrow is Midsummer Day,\" he sings, and this figure (_c_)\r\nsounds from the orchestra. It is made up of two distinct sections.\r\nThat formed by the first two bars is used largely as an accompaniment,\r\nbut it continually comes round to the third and fourth bars, and\r\ncounterpoints are added until at last we are far away from the\r\nbeginning, though, as in the example discussed above, the figure welds\r\nall together into a coherent whole for the intellect to grasp apart\r\nfrom the appeal the music makes to \"the feeling.\" This \"feeling\" of\r\nWagner's was absolutely right, it was infallible; and in consequence\r\nwe find a curious state of affairs is promptly established. The rich,\r\njoyous strain of music, lull of the feeling of summer, immediately\r\nbecomes what was, so to say, at the back of Wagner's mind--the sense\r\nof a spring not known to ordinary mortals, the everlasting spring of\r\nMontsalvat, a spring full of promise and just as full of regrets, the\r\nspring Tennyson sings of--\r\n\r\n    Is it regret for buried time\r\n    That keenlier in sweet April wakes?\r\n\r\nThe enchanting flood of music wells up from the orchestra, and the\r\nvocal writing for Pogner is in Wagner's most lordly manner: there is\r\nnot a hint of the mechanical \"faking\" which characterises similar\r\npassages in the _Ring_. If it was necessary to think that one part was\r\nwritten before another one would be apt to say the voice part was done\r\nfirst; yet when one pays attention to the orchestral part, with its\r\nintricate contrapuntal weaving and interweaving of themes, that seems\r\nimpossible, and one realizes that the two must have been conceived\r\nsimultaneously. The interweaving becomes ever more marvellous as the\r\nspeech proceeds, the burgher theme in a varied form being added, until\r\nat last, with the acclamations of the masters, it culminates in a\r\npassage at once dramatically true, supremely beautiful and as\r\nelaborate in its texture as any Bach fugue. We used to hear much of\r\nthe necessity for ambitious young composers to devote years to the\r\nstudy of text-book counterpoint--indeed, the failure of many youthful\r\ngentlemen to achieve anything on the grand scale has often been\r\nattributed to their lack of diligence, their want of patience with\r\nprofessorial instruction: yet here we have music which, from the\r\nscientific point of view, is as perfect as any in the world, composed\r\nby a daring soul who had no more than six months' teaching. It may be\r\nremarked in passing that Spohr, in his naïve way a good enough\r\nfugue-writer, never received any instruction at all: in point of\r\neffectiveness his fugues beat anything coming from the Jadassohn and\r\nHauptmann pupils.\r\n\r\nWith the re-entry of Walther and his proposal as a member of the guild\r\nby Pogner, we get another of these great phrases, half-theme,\r\nhalf-accompanying figure, and then Walther's spring song. He describes\r\nhow, sitting by the hearth in winter, he first learnt the art of\r\nminstrelsy from reading \"das alte Buch\" of the greatest of minstrels,\r\nWalther von der Vogelweide; then when the winter had passed he heard\r\nthe birds in the green trees singing the selfsame song. Thematically\r\nthis is much richer than the spring-song in, for instance, the\r\n_Valkyrie_, and for the best of reasons--that in the _Valkyrie_ is\r\nincidental, part of a long duet woven from quite other material, while\r\nthat in the _Mastersingers_ is itself the material of a large portion\r\nof the opera. The tune of the first stanza in the _Valkyrie_ is only\r\nreferred to once again throughout the work; and by far the most\r\nexpressive part is made out of a love-theme previously heard. In the\r\n_Mastersingers_ song there is subject-matter enough to make a whole\r\nopera. From this point it is impossible to quote themes--they are far\r\ntoo long. In this respect a writer on music is at a disadvantage with\r\na writer on literature; the latter can cite long passages to establish\r\na case or illustrate his meaning; the unfortunate musical writer must\r\nrefer his readers to scores, and it is inconvenient to sit amidst a\r\npile of these--and Wagner's are the longest and weightiest in\r\nexistence--and dive now here, now there, to follow the author without\r\ndanger of mistaking him. The most important passage in Walther's song\r\nbegins at bar 13 (counting from the beginning of the nine-eight\r\nmeasure); and it is developed in as masterly a fashion as any of the\r\nearlier subjects, only now the style is symphonic, in the Viennese\r\nway, as the others were contrapuntal. The whole thing is full of the\r\nyearning spirit of spring; and, not at all strangely, bears a marked\r\nfamily likeness to Siegfried's song about his mother in the _Ring_.\r\nThroughout the deliberations of the masters the music remains at a\r\nhigh level: there are no _longueurs_; dry recitative and barren\r\nattempts to treat prose poetically alike are absent. Kothner's\r\ndelivery of the rules of the art are good-natured fun; Wagner, with\r\nhis parody of eighteenth-century mannerisms, laughing at the wiseacres\r\nwho wished to tie down modern musicians to the procedure of their\r\nforbears. Walther's trial song, with its gorgeous instrumentation, and\r\nthe rush of the winds of March through budding woods, is even finer\r\nthan the first; and it contains passages which are employed with\r\nexquisite effect in the next Act. There occurs a deal of what can only\r\nbe called musical horseplay as Beckmesser, the pedant type, hidden\r\nbehind a curtain, marks Walther's \"mistakes\"; then comes the only\r\nphrase (_d_) in the opera which can be said to be definitely associated\r\nwith Hans Sachs. It stands first for Sachs' honest longing for the\r\n_new_; and afterwards it is made to express the longing in his soul\r\nfor other things. With the consummate craftsmanship Wagner possessed\r\nat this period he adds to the score the utterance of the masters'\r\ndisapproval, of Sachs' approval, of Beckmesser's pedantic\r\nmaliciousness, of the riotous fooling of the apprentices, until we\r\nhave them all hard at work united in accompanying Walther's song in\r\nwhat is nothing more nor less than a grand operatic finale. The thing\r\nis justified theatrically, so to speak, rather than truly\r\ndramatically; for though the masters manifest dissatisfaction by their\r\nejaculations, and the 'prentices, seeing the way the wind blows, get\r\nout of hand, and chant their scoffing song in the most uproarious\r\nfashion, Walther, inspired by a sense that he is right and a\r\ndetermination not to be put down, continues his song to the end. Then\r\nhe proudly quits the room and the rest follow in confusion, leaving\r\nSachs for a moment to show his vexation; then the curtain drops.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe music of this Act is of the highest order of beauty and never\r\nfalls to the level of mere prettiness; from the first note to the\r\nlast it is vigorous, sturdy. The combination of strength with delicacy\r\nand gentleness is extraordinary: one feels that the reserve of this\r\nstrength behind it all must be unlimited. The orchestration is like\r\nthe music: it is always exactly appropriate to the music. One\r\ncharacteristic of the themes should be noted: with the solitary\r\nexception of that expressive of the deep longing in the heart of Sachs\r\n(_d_) all are singable. Even the burgher motive can be sung and is\r\nsung. When we consider the other operas we perceive that this is by no\r\nmeans always the case. The _Dutchman's_ motive is not so much sung as\r\njodelled by Senta; the Montsalvat music is rather orchestral than\r\nvocal; all the motives in _Tristan_ are either orchestral or\r\ndeclamatory. In saying this I do not at all underrate the other\r\noperas: simply I wish to point out the very marked difference in the\r\nquality of the music. The _Mastersingers_ is a long song, and the\r\nfirst act the first verse of it. Such a profusion of melodies has\r\nnever been scattered over one act of an opera--not songs simply\r\npleasing to the ear, but constituting subjects surcharged with feeling\r\nand capable of unfolding, as the opera goes on, into fresh forms of\r\nthe rarest beauty and splendour. We cannot lay our finger on a\r\nsuperfluous bar, not one that can be cut without badly injuring the\r\nwhole work. This criticism applies to the other two acts. As new\r\nmaterial is introduced it is all singable; though harmonious effects\r\nare freely used they are all there to enforce the melody. The swan, or\r\nriver, phrase in _Lohengrin_ is, of course, purely an effect of\r\nharmony; but in this glorification of song Wagner seemed determined to\r\ntrust entirely to song and use his harmonic resources and\r\ndevices--which were inexhaustible--another day. Only once does he\r\nresort to them: in the third act when Walther tells Sachs he has had a\r\nlovely dream, by a single unexpected chord he gets the dream\r\natmosphere he wanted. At the same time the harmonies throughout are\r\nfreer, more daring, than they are even in _Tristan_. They are managed\r\nwith consummate mastery, the sharp collisions of the many winding\r\nvoices of the orchestra occurring infallibly in precisely the right\r\nplace. As I have said, not Bach himself managed a score of many parts\r\nwith finer mastery, nor gives one a more satisfying sense of complete\r\nsecurity; not Bach, nor Handel, nor Mozart was a greater\r\ncontrapuntist; instructively, instinctively, he knew the way his\r\nstream of music was going, and so mighty a craftsman had he grown that\r\nto achieve new harmonies and harmonic progressions by the interweaving\r\nof many melodies, each individual and expressive, seems almost like\r\nchild's-play to him. But the old saying, easy reading means hard\r\nwriting, is true in the case of the _Mastersingers_. We have only to\r\nglance at Wagner's letters to see the labour all his later works cost\r\nhim, and his incessant complaints about the state of his nerves are\r\nsignificant. The writing of the _Mastersingers_ was spread over six\r\nyears. It does not matter whether it was written easily or with\r\ndifficulty--the marvel is that it was written at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe first act is the song of spring, the second one of a beauteous\r\nsummer night. The night slowly falls, and lights are seen at the\r\nwindows of the gabled houses. The apprentices put up the shutters of\r\nthe shops and bar the doors. We have old Nuremberg before our eyes; by\r\nSachs' door is the inevitable elder-tree, by Pogner's the just as\r\ninevitable lime; and as surely as Schumann caught the scent of flowers\r\nfrom a piece of Chopin's, do we catch the fragrance of those trees in\r\nWagner's music. The 'prentices, hard at work, merrily chant\r\n\"Midsummer's Eve\" (\"Johannestag\"--not a precise translation), and\r\nbanter David concerning that very serious matter, his courtship of\r\nMagdalena, the accompaniment being spun largely from the midsummer\r\ntheme of the first act. The atmosphere, sweet, clear, redolent of the\r\nold world, and seeming to sparkle with excitement about the coming\r\njoys of the morrow, is first created by a prelude scarce thirty bars\r\nlong. Through more than half of this section we get shakes and\r\narpeggios on one (technical) discord (_e_), with snatches of the\r\nmidsummer theme, and the exhilaration of the eve of a holiday given to\r\nus in this very simplest of ways shows the miracle worker in his\r\nhappiest mood. Like the opening of the _Rhinegold_, this brief prelude\r\nis an exemplification of Wagner's advice to young composers--never\r\ntravel out of the key you are in if you can say in it what you have to\r\nsay. The instrumentation is delicate, almost ethereal--in fact, the\r\nwhole thing would be ethereal, or, at least, fairy-like, but for the\r\nnote of gaiety, jollity, struck in the apprentices' tunes. But\r\npresently played-out fugue subjects are heard, and we know it is\r\nBeckmesser or no one. Dramatically the scene is of the lightest, but\r\nWagner seizes the opportunity to paint a musical picture of Nuremberg\r\nas Pogner holds forth on the festivities arranged for the morrow;\r\nnever did he give us anything more delightful than this picture of a\r\nmediæval city, anything more beautifully or more fully charged with\r\nthe sense of the past. They go in, and shortly Sachs comes out; he\r\ntells David to arrange his tools and get away to bed, and sits down,\r\nintending to work outside. The hammering motive (_f_) sounds out\r\nvigorously for a couple of minutes; but Sachs is already dreaming of\r\nWalther's song, and presently we get a phrase of it in a shape of\r\nsuperb beauty--the fifty times distilled essence of spring is in\r\nit--then another bit of it is taken and used as an accompaniment with\r\nmost enchanting effect: one feels the cool night breeze touching\r\nSachs' cheek, and, as in the introduction, one scents the aroma of\r\nlime and elder--\r\n\r\n    \"The elder scent floats round me; so mild, so rich it falls,\r\n    Its sweetness weighs upon me; words from my heart it calls....\"\r\n\r\nWith its gently rocking motion and the tremolando in the bass it is as\r\nbeautiful in its way as the opening scene, already discussed, of the\r\nsecond Act of _Tristan_--the picture of the brook running through the\r\ndarkness from the fountain in King Mark's castle garden. Sachs\r\nabruptly ceases, and sets to work; and the hammering phrase is heard\r\nagain, now combined with the beginning of another subject, liker than\r\never to Siegfried's great song--the very harmonies as well as the\r\ngeneral rhythm are the same--and this subject is developed before long\r\ninto the Cobbler's song. But \"and still that strain I hear\"; and he\r\nstops and dreams again over Walther's song. \"Springtime's behest,\r\nwithin his breast, on heart and voice there was laid,\" he sings; and\r\nto music compact of sheer loveliness he praises the song, terminating\r\nwith a passage which I take to be nine bars of vocal writing as fine\r\nas can be found in the whole of music--\"The bird who sang this morn.\"\r\n\r\nEva steals out from her father's door, and at once the dramatic motive\r\nof the action deepens. We have had up to now the joy and beauty of the\r\nnight, the aroma of the trees, and all the warmth of Sachs' artist's\r\nheart as he dwells on Walther's song of spring: now the human element\r\ncomes in and is reflected in the music. Eva wants to know whether\r\nthere is any hope for Walther or any chance of help from Sachs, and\r\nshe tries to find out without fully disclosing the secret of her love.\r\nHer wistful longing is expressed in two perfect melodies, one new, the\r\nother shaped from a fragment of Walther's first song; these two are\r\ngone over again and again, always varied and growing more intense in\r\nexpressiveness, until Eva's secret is no secret from the audience,\r\nthough Sachs himself is supposed not to be at first quite sure about\r\nit. When he satisfies himself the orchestra at once sings the phrase\r\n(_d_), and its full significance is brought out. The real Hans Sachs,\r\nwe are told, when getting on in years wooed and won quite a young\r\ngirl, and the union turned out satisfactorily. That, obviously, was\r\ntoo tame a matter to be set forth in a long opera--every one would\r\nhave yawned before the finish of the first Act; and, as it has been\r\npointed out, the main change made from the original sketch of the\r\nlibretto to the libretto of the actual opera lies in this: that Wagner\r\ncreated a soul for _his_ Sachs. Sachs loves Eva, too, with a blending\r\nof benevolent fatherly affection and sexual love; but for the\r\nhaphazard appearance of Walther he would certainly have gained her for\r\nhis wife; for she would have infinitely preferred him to Beckmesser, a\r\npedant, a bad artist, and, to speak colloquially, a mean and\r\ndisastrous cad. In the trial scene he has already half divined\r\nWalther's object, and the theme (_d_) in its application hints not\r\nonly at his longing to grasp \"the new\" in Walther's song, but also his\r\nlonging to possess Eva, with a sting of bitterness as he resolves to\r\nrenounce her in favour of the younger suitor. Towards the end of the\r\nopera, when Sachs brings the young pair together he says (to music\r\nquoted from _Tristan_) he would not play the part of King Mark and\r\nthus invite his Isolda to find a Tristan. I ask the reader to compare\r\nthis phrase with one form of the first love-theme in _Tristan_ (_g_).\r\nThe essential notes are the same; but as a melody is made to sound\r\nanother and different thing by varying the harmonies, there is in the\r\nSachs phrase a touch of sadness, nearly hopelessness, but no hint of\r\nit in the _Tristan_ form. The true meaning is not obvious when it\r\nfirst occurs: Sachs seems simply to be the appreciator of true art and\r\nto be standing up for the true artist Walther against the barren\r\npedant Beckmesser.\r\n\r\nAnd I beg leave here to make a digression. I have spoken of Wagner's\r\nobsession by the notion that he could by his union of drama, music,\r\npictorial art, etc., make his work clear enough to be understood at a\r\nfirst performance: in his letters he referred to a plan for giving the\r\n_Ring_ only once and then burning the theatre and the score--he did\r\nnot add the composer and the artists. Unfortunately this view has been\r\ntaken as a tenable one by good critics, and it has been argued\r\nseriously that such a phrase as (_d_) is meaningless, because its\r\nsignificance becomes apparent only in the second act. No great work of\r\nart can be seen at one glance--least of all Wagner's. If a painter\r\nputs before us a picture, say, of Perseus and Andromeda, we know at\r\nany rate what it is about; and there is no difficulty in understanding\r\na Madonna. But, with the exception of the _Dutchman_, Wagner reshaped\r\nall his subjects so that, for instance, an acquaintance with the\r\nNibelung legends is rather a hindrance than a help to a swift\r\nunderstanding of the _Ring_. At first his King Mark is a puzzle to\r\nthose who know the Arthurian legends; and in the same way, if the\r\nSachs of history is confounded with Wagner's Sachs, we are at once\r\nutterly at sea. But a knowledge of Wagner's Sachs can scarcely be\r\nacquired from the words alone: more is told us in the music than in\r\nthe words; and before we can grasp the drama as well as Wagner's use\r\nof phrases we must hear the opera many, many times. I deny that this\r\nis an illegitimate mode of appeal to an audience; I deny that the\r\nindispensability of knowing an opera thoroughly before you judge it is\r\nto imply that it is less than a very great work of art; I affirm that\r\nthe nobler, profounder, more beautiful a work of art, the more\r\nnecessary it is to be able to look at every passage with a full\r\nconsciousness of all that is to come after, as well as of what has\r\ngone before. Wagner himself was compact of contradictions, and so,\r\nwhile trying to create his operas in such fashion that a single\r\nperformance would suffice to reveal their splendour, he took the\r\nprecaution to write detailed explanations which might serve the same\r\npurpose as many previous performances; and he also wrote explanations\r\nof Beethoven's symphonies.\r\n\r\nThroughout this long scene the tender stream of melody flows on, never\r\nlapsing into anything approaching prettiness or feebleness, flooding\r\nus with an overwhelming sense of a far-away past, while full utterance\r\nis found for Eva's anxiety, then her despair, and her wish, timidly\r\nspoken, to give herself to Sachs rather than to be won by Beckmesser.\r\nA scene of such length, constructed on such a plan, could have been\r\ncarried through by no other composer than Wagner--the sweetness,\r\nvariety and dramatic strength and truth are Wagner at his ripest and\r\nbest. After Eva's heart has been opened to us he takes up (_d_), and\r\nthough Sachs is a little grumpy--the effort to resign Eva inevitably\r\nthough insensibly showing itself--we learn all about him and share\r\nhis secret, too, in a very short while. Then Magdalena calls Eva and\r\ntells her Beckmesser intends to serenade her, and goes in to take her\r\nplace at the window; and then comes the only love-duet in the opera.\r\nWalther appears; and Eva chants a melody that is surely first cousin\r\nto one of the greatest in _Euryanthe_. As we get on we find it harder\r\nto give any adequate idea of the enchantment of the thing. The gentle\r\nevening wind makes its voice heard, low, soft; and Walther, scorning\r\nthe masters who compose and sing only by rule--and, by the way, what\r\nwould Wagner have done in the days when a musician had to play and\r\nsing before he could be understood or ever heard as a composer?--works\r\nhimself up to a state of tumultuous indignation; then a strange noise\r\nis heard in the distance, the watchman's cow-horn. A minute's silence,\r\nand next one of the sweetest melodies in all music--expressive of the\r\nlove of Walther and Eva, but also full of that feeling for the remote\r\npast; then the entrance of the watchman, with his warning to the folk\r\nto look after their lights and fires: it is ten o'clock (late hours)\r\nin our city, and disaster must be kept off at all costs. Sachs has\r\nheard the talk between Eva and Walther and determined to ward off\r\ndisaster in one shape at any rate: he places a light so that they\r\ncannot get away without being seen; they are furious, desperate, but\r\nthat loveliest of melodies flows on until Beckmesser comes in to\r\nperform his serenade. From this point Wagner, without ever ceasing to\r\nbe the consummate artist or allowing the old-world atmosphere to\r\nweaken its hold on our senses, lets himself go like a schoolboy out\r\nfor a holiday. He begins his splendid song, a parable: Eve was well\r\nenough off in the Garden of Eden, but when she took a wrong step the\r\nLord sent a shoemaker to save her. The words are in the very spirit of\r\nthe Middle Ages: a materialistic, naïve, literal handling of spiritual\r\nthings; but the most devout of believers can find no cause of offence.\r\nThe song opens, as I have mentioned, in the rhythm (4-4 instead of\r\n3-4) of the Sword scene, the harmonies being practically the same. The\r\ntune is one of Wagner's finest: indeed, if we did not know what he\r\ncould do, if we could not hear the opera once in a while, we should\r\nrefuse to believe that such dignity and beauty of utterance could be\r\nkept up alongside of the grave old cobbler's humorous bedevilment.\r\nBeckmesser wants to serenade Eva--mistaking Magdalena at the window in\r\nEva's dress for that lady; Sachs insists on finishing Beckmesser's new\r\nshoes for the contest of the morrow, and revenges himself for the\r\ninsult inflicted upon Walther in the morning by striking one blow for\r\nevery mistake. Before this is arranged there is a long altercation,\r\nand as the heat of the men's temper dies down that sweet love melody\r\nof the old world creeps in again; but then the farce commences.\r\nBeckmesser's song is almost outrageous caricature; the parody of the\r\nacademics of Wagner's day who made no mistakes from the academic point\r\nof view, and yet could write nothing that sounded right, is\r\nexcruciatingly funny; then David, under the impression that the chief\r\nof the academics is serenading Magdalena, comes out, goes in to fetch\r\na stick, comes out again armed, and sets to work with it upon\r\nBeckmesser; the good burghers have been annoyed by Beckmesser's\r\ncaterwauling and Sachs' hammering; out they come to keep their streets\r\nin order; and the tumult begins in serious earnest. Every one hits at\r\nevery one else, as Irishmen hit, it is said, at Donnybrook Fair;\r\nBeckmesser is sadly injured; Sachs kicks David indoors, Eva and\r\nMagdalena are got in to Pogner's; Sachs gets Walther in with him also;\r\nthe row dies down. No one save Sachs and David knows how it started;\r\nno one knows why it ends. It is--allowing for the lapse of four\r\ncenturies--rather like a cab accident in London or any other great\r\ncity: ladies in night attire look out of windows, and, seeing their\r\nhusbands engaged in deadly warfare, in the very spirit of Miss Miggs\r\nbegin to empty pails of cold water over the combatants\r\nindiscriminately. Apparently this cools the ardour of everybody. One\r\nby one the crowd makes for shelter; the watchman's horn is heard a few\r\nstreets away; and when he arrives with his lantern and stick a few\r\nminutes later the alley and platz are deserted. The moon shines out on\r\nthe lovely scene; the old man chants his call--it is eleven of the\r\nnight; all the world should be in bed; all the lights and fires should\r\nbe out; he goes off, leaving us the wondrous picture of old Nuremberg\r\nsleeping in the heart of old Germany; and the curtain slowly falls. A\r\nvery ineffective \"curtain\" it was in the eyes of most opera-goers in\r\nthe 'sixties, and is in the eyes of the ordinary play-goer of to-day;\r\nbut, for all that, one of the most superb to be found in the whole of\r\nthe dramatic works of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is, I have just said, difficult to analyse the music of such a\r\nscene as this, and only one or two points may be noted now. I have\r\nreferred again to the consummate mastery of technique manifested\r\nthroughout the opera, and here there is no falling off from this\r\nmastery. Throughout we have that atmosphere of bygone generations, and\r\nalso a combination, curious when looked into, of homeliness with\r\nnobility. Sachs' song is merrily trolled out, but underneath its\r\njoviality we feel the greatness of the man--a man so great in\r\ncharacter that no suits of shining armour, no heralds and no waving\r\nbanners are needed to make him impressive: he remains, even while he\r\nworks at his last and sings a sort of club-dinner song, the simple\r\ncobbler-poet, great by reason of his sincerity and his artist-soul.\r\nThe street scrimmage is the most realistic thing of the sort ever\r\nattempted, not to say achieved. It is customary to describe the music\r\nas a fugue, and, if that is so, no more unfugue-like fugue was ever\r\npenned. It begins with a parody of a fugue, the answer being announced\r\nbefore the subject--that is, what purports to be the answer occurs a\r\nfifth instead of a fourth below; then what purports to be the subject\r\nis re-announced one tone above its first statement, and answered, as\r\nbefore, a fifth below. Then the melody of Beckmesser's grotesque is\r\nbrought in and treated contrapuntally, with what theorists call free\r\nimitation in the accompaniment. Fugue, real or tonal, there is none.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThis midsummer night's orgy over, we next have midsummer day. The\r\ncurtain rises; the early morning sun shines through the windows of\r\nSachs' house; Sachs sits there, a book on his knees, but dreaming, not\r\nreading. But before the rising of the curtain there is a prelude to\r\ntell us of his musings. When we know the opera this piece is easy\r\nenough to follow. He thinks over the events of the past night, and\r\npasses through thought into dream, getting clean away from earth into\r\na serener air--and coming slowly back to earth again. Structurally\r\nthis piece is on the same plan as others of the preludes--that of the\r\nthird act of _Tannhäuser_, for example. It is nonsense to say the\r\npiece is meaningless because it cannot be fully grasped at a first\r\nhearing: I have already spoken of the fallacy involved in that\r\ncontention--the fallacy that a work of art should be completely\r\ncomprehensible at a first hearing. It is equally nonsensical to decry\r\nthe \"literary\" method of composition: that method was the method of at\r\nleast two others of the great composers, Haydn and Beethoven, who\r\n\"worked to a story.\" In fact, all these unreasonable reasoners who\r\ntell us these fine incontrovertible pieces of absurdity place\r\nthemselves on the same level as the pundits who pointed out that\r\nbecause Wagner used the piano when composing, therefore he could not\r\ncompose--forgetting Haydn's explicit statement that he always composed\r\nat the piano; forgetting how Mozart spent hours and days at the piano\r\nin doing the creative work of a new opera; forgetting that Beethoven\r\nused the piano even when he could no longer hear it (see Schindler's\r\nor Ries' account of the composition of the \"Appassionata\" sonata). As\r\na mere piece of music, a succession of tones and combinations of\r\ntones, the rare quality of this prelude cannot but be felt; and though\r\nwe may not at once grasp its full significance, no one can miss the\r\nsequence of the emotions expressed--the grave reflection of the\r\nopening, the hymn-like succeeding passage, the gradual mounting of the\r\nmusic into a beauteous, calm morning air, some realm of ecstatic peace\r\nfar above the clouds, the gradual return to the mood of the opening.\r\nWhen we do know what it is all about the expression of the different\r\nstages of feeling is felt to be more precise--that is all.\r\n\r\nThe prelude prepares for Sachs' monologue, a profound thing, and one\r\nmoreover entirely new--had Shakespeare been a musician he might have\r\ndone something like it. Then David the Irresponsible enters, and we\r\nget some more of Wagner's exquisite fooling; next we have Walther with\r\nhis \"dream,\" out of which the Prize-song is made. This is a long\r\nscene--perhaps a little too long--for Wagner seems to have been\r\ndetermined that if the audience did not feel the beauty of his melody\r\nit should not be for want of hearing it often enough. As Walther\r\nsings Sachs takes it down in tablature, calling out to him what\r\nsections are next required. Sachs then declares that this is indeed a\r\nmaster-song, and will win Walther the prize he so much desires; he and\r\nWalther go off to attire themselves for the contest, and Beckmesser\r\nlimps in. In dumb show he describes his aches and pains and shows how\r\nhe is thinking of his thrashing of the night before; and what he does\r\nnot say the orchestra says very plainly for him. There is far too much\r\nof it--for English tastes, at any rate--before he is alarmed by\r\ndiscovering the still wet manuscript in Sachs' handwriting. He\r\nsnatches it up and conceals it; Sachs comes back dressed for the great\r\nceremony, and there is a row--Beckmesser querulous, bitterly angry and\r\nsuspicious, on the one hand, Sachs quietly scornful on the other. Let\r\nme point out that this scene is another example of Wagner's stage\r\ncraftsmanship at its best. There is nothing conventional in the way\r\nSachs and Walther are got off to give Beckmesser his chance: what more\r\nnatural than that they should go to prepare themselves? Nor is the\r\nfinding of the manuscript one of those things that give people who\r\ndon't like opera cause to blaspheme: Sachs simply left it on the table\r\nto dry until he returned for it. Compare this scene with that in\r\nVerdi's _Falstaff_, where that fat hero, hiding behind a screen, must\r\nbe supposed not to hear an elaborate ensemble number sung by the other\r\ncharacters--an instance which one might presume to be intended to make\r\nthe \"aside\" so ridiculous that no one would ever dare to use it again.\r\nWagner, for the time, at any rate, had ceased to make demands on the\r\ncredulity of his audiences or their meek acceptance of a preposterous\r\nconvention. The business is kept up too long, as I have just\r\nconfessed; and this is perhaps explained by Wagner's evident desire to\r\nmake fun of the men who for years had called him a charlatan, a bad\r\nmusician, and generally done their best to prevent him earning his\r\nliving. Still, it is a small blot on a big opera. The music for such\r\nincidents cannot be of the highest beauty; here we have one of the\r\ncases of a _tour de force_. But even its inferiority is made to serve\r\na purpose; it serves as a foil for that which accompanies the entry of\r\nEva and her conversation with Sachs. Beckmesser has gone away joyfully\r\nwith the manuscript, fully believing he has got possession of a song\r\nby Sachs--who has told him he can do what he likes with it--and\r\nrevealing the fact that, despite all his boasting, in his heart he\r\nknows the cobbler to be immeasurably his superior. In music hardly to\r\nbe matched for sensuous beauty Eva's trembling perturbation and hopes\r\nand fears are exquisitely suggested; then with the arrival of Walther,\r\nand also of Magdalena and David, we get a little more fooling,\r\nfollowed by one of Wagner's loveliest and most amazing feats, the\r\nquintet. If only for one reason it is amazing. Only a few years before\r\nthe notes were set down, and certainly only a year or two before the\r\nthing was planned in the libretto, he had vehemently declared, in\r\nessays and letters, that never again would he compose anything in the\r\noperatic style: he was for ever done with opera; henceforth\r\nmusic-drama alone would occupy him. And lo! here, at the very first\r\nopportunity, we find him not merely writing a grand opera finale to\r\nhis first act--which he could justify; a rough-and-tumble finale to\r\nhis second act--which he could justify; but a set concerto piece in\r\nthe middle of his third act--which according to his own theories at\r\nany rate, he could not justify! He might well avow that when he came\r\nto compose _Tristan_ he discovered he had gone far beyond his\r\ntheories. The justification for the quintet is its beauty and the fact\r\nthat it finds expression for the feeling of the moment. All the same,\r\nI have heard it encored more than once; and an encore in the middle of\r\nthe act of a Wagner music-drama, or even music-comedy, is almost\r\ninconceivable.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nThe two pairs, Walther and Eva, and David and Magdalena, having been\r\njoined together, and David having been freed from his 'prentice\r\nservitude by a hearty box on the ear, the quintet having been sung and\r\n(as just remarked) sometimes encored, Wagner gathers himself together\r\nfor a gigantic scene as characteristic of his genius as anything he\r\nconceived: no one, indeed, but Wagner could have done or would have\r\nthought of attempting such a scene. He has shown us the masters of\r\nNuremberg in conclave, the apprentices romping and joking, the crowd\r\nin the street losing its head; and how he gives us a picture of the\r\ntown on a fête-day, with the trade-guilds marching to the\r\nsinging-contest. The tailors, the shoemakers, the bakers and the\r\nbutchers all file past, chanting the merits of their various callings,\r\nfinally gathering on the meadow outside the town to await the arrival\r\nof the chief burghers. It is a picture, not a dramatic scene, and to\r\njudge only from the text might suggest the _Rienzi_ way of planning\r\nthings. It is not, however, a spectacle in the sense in which we apply\r\nthat word to some of the _Rienzi_ scenes; there is nothing pompous\r\nabout it, no recourse is made to gorgeous costumes. The artisans march\r\npast in their holiday clothes, each guild bearing its banner; the\r\nbanners wave in the bright sunlight, and there is plenty of colour as\r\nwell as of bustle and gaiety; but all is homely in style--there is not\r\na noble person in the crowd--and the thing is carried through by the\r\nvividly imagined music, the energy and sparkle of it, the positive\r\nsplendour of the orchestration. The various guild-choruses are full of\r\nhumour, the many ridiculous things being saved from lapsing into mere\r\nhorseplay and nonsense by the endless series of beautiful tunes. This\r\npart of the business ends with a waltz which shows that Wagner might,\r\nhad he chosen, have been the finest writer of dance-music in Europe,\r\nand driven the Strausses and the rest from the field.\r\n\r\nThe signal is given of the masters' approach, and as Sachs comes on\r\nthe whole crowd presses to greet him with a setting of his own song to\r\nMartin Luther. The transition from the jollity of the dancing to the\r\nsolemnity, nay, sublimity, of this chorus is managed with perfect\r\ndeftness: there is no incongruity. It is this song that passed through\r\nSachs' brain when we found him absorbed in meditation at the beginning\r\nof the act. The poem--written by the historical Sachs--is itself\r\nbeautiful, and Wagner has made it immortal; only he at his ripest and\r\nbest could combine in an opera-chorus such strength with such\r\nsweetness, combine the directness of a part-song with the free play of\r\nparts, with never a touch of formalism. It must be held to be one of\r\nthe most superb things in an opera which is as nearly perfect as ever\r\nopera is likely to be.\r\n\r\nThis over, we are gradually prepared for the ridiculous and\r\npreposterous again. Beckmesser is to make his bid for Eva's hand with\r\nwhat he supposes to be a song by Sachs; and to an accompaniment of\r\nmusic which, lively and graceful enough, is purposely of no very\r\ndistinctive character. The preparations are made. By the time he\r\nmounts the heap of turf to address his audience we are ready for him.\r\nOf course he makes a fine ass of himself. He has not had time to\r\nmemorise the poem of the song, and with extravagant fun Wagner makes\r\nhim change the poetical and serious words into words of most ludicrous\r\nsignificance. Walther's melody he has not got hold of at all, and in a\r\nstate of intense nervousness tries to fit the words to the burlesque\r\ntune of his previous night's serenade. The accents all fall in the\r\nwrong place; and as he stumbles miserably along the crowd begins to\r\ntitter. Wagner of course was parodying and satirising the pedants of\r\nhis own day, especially the composers of psalms who could not set a\r\nstraightforward Bible sentence without making nonsense of it. Readers\r\nacquainted with the ordinary musical setting of a portion of the\r\nChurch of England service, or the average organist's anthem, will know\r\nwhat I mean: the average organist seems to consider it a point of\r\nartistry, if not indeed of honour, to accentuate the words so as to\r\nleave the meaning as little intelligible as possible; and in many\r\ncases--I have some before me now--he contrives to make them\r\nnonsensical. It was this sort of thing, perpetrated by the very men\r\nwho denied him any musical gift, that Wagner held up to derision in\r\nBeckmesser's song. The tittering swells into a roar, and at last\r\nBeckmesser, cursing Sachs for a deceiver and false friend, flies. With\r\nthat, fooling ends. To music of a rare sweet gravity Sachs invites the\r\n\"volk\" to hearken to the song when given by the man who composed it.\r\nWalther steps up and sings; as he goes on the people again make\r\nthemselves heard, but to praise, not to deride; towards the finish\r\ntheir voices form a choral accompaniment, and we have the counterpart\r\nto the finale of the first act. Walther wins the day and Eva; and,\r\nslightly against his will, he is made a Master. There is an address\r\nfrom Sachs, in which he exhorts Walther and all present not to despise\r\nart, but to honour it as being (for this is what his speech amounts\r\nto) the heart's blood of national life. Preachments are not usually\r\nstimulating, but this one is mercifully brief, and is accompanied by\r\nfine, melodious strains. With its contrapuntal weaving it leads to\r\nthe final chorus, and also it puts Sachs back again into the position\r\nfrom which the importance of Walther's song has thrust him: it is a\r\nlast reminder that the opera is a glorification of song, and that the\r\nmasters have a sacred trust--to guard song pedantry and commercialism.\r\nThe work closes with a grand chorus made up of familiar music, a\r\nglorious blaze and riot of orchestral and choral colour.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nThe second section of this chapter contains what I have to say by way\r\nof summing up. Let me repeat that the _Mastersingers_ is notable for\r\nthe endless flow of beautiful melodies, neither broken and scrappy\r\nnor, on the other hand, approaching monotony: there is infinite\r\nvariety combined with magnificent breadth; for the nobility hidden\r\nunder homeliness--a characteristic most marked in Sachs' music; for\r\nmiraculous colouring now pitched in a low and tender key, now blazing\r\nas in the last finale; for the picture of Nuremberg in the old time,\r\nand for the vigour and fun with which the old life is depicted. It is\r\nWagner's one cheerful opera, and from some points of view, perhaps,\r\nhis most perfect; nowhere else did he try to keep on a high and even\r\nlevel of pure song for so long; it does not strain our nerves, and\r\nwill bear hearing perhaps more frequently than anything else he wrote.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nKING LUDWIG\r\n\r\n\r\nIn resuming Wagner's biography we may conveniently take it up after\r\nthe completion of _Tristan_ in August, 1859. I summarised the events\r\nleading up to his beginning on the _Mastersingers_; but it is\r\nnecessary to go over some of the ground in a little more detail to\r\nshow in what a terrible plight Wagner had been landed when King Ludwig\r\nII of Bavaria sent for him. He was bankrupt financially, in health and\r\nin hope. Like the nose of his boyish hero, everything turned to dust\r\nthe moment he touched it. Concerts in Paris nearly brought utter\r\nruin--would have brought utter ruin had not a woman friend and admirer\r\ncome to the rescue. He gained no money by his concert tour until, as\r\nhe said, he got to St. Petersburg, and there the amount cannot have\r\nbeen stupendous. He laboured with brain, heart and hand to give the\r\nworld masterpieces; the world responded by not responding at all--by\r\ntaking absolutely no notice. In Paris he made many valuable friends,\r\nbut they were useless to him for the realisation of his projects. They\r\nmight help him from moment to moment, and did help him to remain alive\r\nand to avert calamities: a secure and peaceful living they could not\r\nguarantee him: they could not assist him in getting his works\r\nproperly performed, or performed at all. I have already discussed the\r\nmistaken policy, on his part, of writing so much about himself, and\r\nthe futility of his German friends taking up the pen on his behalf.\r\nThe friends meant well, and there was nothing else they could do; but\r\nat the time their efforts resulted in nothing. He published the words\r\nof the _Mastersingers_ and of the _Ring_, and the consequence was only\r\nthat a professor publicly implored him not to set such a monstrosity\r\nas the second to music. It is hard to say who did him the greatest\r\namount of harm--his French friends, his German friends, or his enemies\r\non either side of wherever the frontier was in those far-off days.\r\nWhatever was done for him, whatever he did for himself, whatever was\r\ndone against him, it seemed all one: he walked steadily on into the\r\nthickest of grimy fogs. By romping over Europe like any itinerant\r\nconductor of this day, he might earn an uncertain livelihood: as for\r\nany prospect of getting on with his _Mastersingers_, his _Ring_ and a\r\nscore of other plans bubbling in his head, that was a receding\r\nprospect indeed: every year, every month, made the prospect still more\r\nremote. His music was either misunderstood or disliked: certainly the\r\nman's writings and the writings of his friends resulted in _him_ being\r\ndisliked. When he settled in Vienna after the triumphs of his earlier\r\noperas he speedily discovered this sad truth, but did not discover the\r\nreason why. His life had been a long tragedy, and with this collapse\r\nof his Vienna hopes he seemed to touch the lowest depths.\r\n\r\nSo he got away from Vienna, and one day had a visitor. This gentleman\r\nsaid, in effect, that King Ludwig II had just ascended the throne, and\r\nwould be glad of a call. Instantly the grimy fog cleared away; all was\r\nsplendid sunshine: in that sunshine Richard was henceforth to bask and\r\nthe fruits of his genius were to ripen. He went to Munich, and there\r\nwere prompt results. In 1865 _Tristan_ was (at last) produced; he was\r\nenabled to make a new start on the _Mastersingers_, which was\r\neventually produced in Munich in 1868. But in Munich, as elsewhere,\r\nthe inevitable occurred. Wagner suddenly became the \"favourite,\" quite\r\nas in mediæval times, of a not very popular king, one of a line noted\r\nfor mental and moral deficiency; and, without consulting any of the\r\npowers that had ruled for a long time in Bavaria, in his mad\r\nenthusiasm he set about \"reforming\" everything. Apparently he wanted\r\nwithin twenty-four hours to set up a Saxon Utopia in the midst of a\r\npeople who hated the Saxons. He wanted to establish a new opera-house,\r\nwhere perfect artists were to give perfect performances for audiences\r\nthat did not pretend to be perfect. As such performances could not\r\npossibly pay, the audiences, besides putting down the price of\r\nadmittance, had, as taxpayers, to make good the deficits. King Ludwig\r\nwas supposed to do it; but where on earth was Ludwig's money to come\r\nfrom if not out of the taxpayers' pockets? Then there was to be\r\nfounded a genuine school of music--an excellent scheme, but one,\r\nagain, which could not possibly be profitable, or for some time earn\r\nenough to cover its expenses. Who was to pay?--of course King Ludwig:\r\nthat is, the taxpayers. And Wagner was not only known (with absolute\r\ncertainty) to wish to divert from the pockets of \"placemen\" funds they\r\nhad learnt to consider their perquisites, with a view of turning\r\nMunich into a musical paradise on earth: it seemed to many that he was\r\ngaining such an ascendancy over the feeble mind and will of the king\r\nthat shortly he would be dictator of the country. That view was not\r\nwell-founded: Wagner, dreamer though he was, had a strong practical\r\nvein in his character: if he saw that one of his dreams could be\r\nrealised he realised it at the first opportunity; if he saw it could\r\nnot be realised he explained it in an article and left others to make\r\nthe first effort at realisation. The man who created Bayreuth was not\r\nthe man to imagine altogether vainly that he could, per favour of a\r\nking, whom he must have known to be utterly weak, turn some millions\r\nof citizens and villagers into an Utopian nation of art-lovers and so\r\non. But hatred surrounded him everywhere; the machinery of the state\r\ncame early to a standstill, and, finally, the king had to ask him to\r\nwithdraw for a longer or shorter while.\r\n\r\nThis is the plain truth of an affair concerning which there has been\r\nan immense amount of lying on both sides. The scandals about the\r\npersonal relations of the king and Wagner I leave to the vampires; as\r\nfor the gentry who will have it that Wagner was \"persecuted\" out of\r\nMunich by Jews, Christians, journalists and bank-managers, I leave\r\nthem to anybody who likes to take them up. That Wagner had to quit\r\nMunich was a sad thing in his life--a very sorrow's crown of sorrow;\r\nand it was a bad thing for German music. It put back the clock many\r\nyears. But, sad though it was for Wagner, in the long run it proved\r\ngood for him. He would have composed little more in such a city--a\r\ncity so misgoverned and misguided as Munich: his days would have been\r\nfilled with bitterness, his nerves would have been quickly shattered\r\nby intrigues. He was now amply provided for; a villa--the celebrated\r\n\"Triebschen\"--was taken for him on the shores of Lucerne, and here he\r\nsettled and remained for some years. Here he finished the _Ring_ and\r\nplanned Bayreuth.\r\n\r\nAnother thing which contributed to his unpopularity was his relations\r\nwith his own and another man's wife. Hans von Bülow, his pupil, had\r\nmarried Liszt's daughter Cosima: that lady became infatuated with\r\nWagner, and Wagner with her, and they virtually eloped together.\r\nMinna's cause was eagerly taken up by musicians, operatic people\r\ngenerally, and journalists, though none of them cared a rap about\r\nMinna. The most scandalous stories were circulated, and Wagner came to\r\nbe thought not only a charlatan cadger living on the State funds, but\r\none who used those funds to satisfy his carnal and other appetites.\r\nHis silk dressing-gowns, his gorgeous apartments, his sybarite\r\nfeastings, were the common talk of the newspapers: while he was\r\nslaving, as the saying goes, twenty-six hours out of twenty-four, the\r\ncommon fancy was taught to picture him as taking his ease in\r\nunheard-of luxury.\r\n\r\nThese matters have nearly all been indirectly dealt with already, and\r\nas we come to review the situation, this is what we find. Minna was an\r\nimpossible wife for such a man: she never could understand why he\r\ncould not have remained quietly at his post in Dresden, indifferent to\r\ngood or bad opera representations, and unambitious concerning the\r\nproper artistic production of his own works. When calamity followed\r\ncalamity, to her all the trouble seemed due to Richard's\r\npig-headedness; and she would at once have grown cheerful and\r\ngood-natured had he burned his finished and unfinished scores and\r\nwritten \"something popular.\" She was, I say, impossible. Cosima, for\r\nher part, found Bülow impossible. A splendid character in many ways,\r\nhe was as wayward and quarrelsome a man as has lived. So Richard and\r\nMinna drifted apart, and Bülow and Cosima drifted apart, and in the\r\nend Richard and Cosima drifted together. The censures that still are\r\npassed at times on their conduct are hypocritical and grotesque. The\r\npeople who pass them are usually people who think that the Ten\r\nCommandments were made only to be observed by the poorer classes, or\r\nby other people, not themselves, and are willing enough to excuse\r\noffences against the marriage laws when they are committed by folks of\r\nexalted social position. The whole truth about the Richard-Cosima\r\naffair will evidently never be known; no one has told; three of the\r\nfour concerned have passed away; and those writers to-day who pretend\r\nto know most are precisely those whom I suspect of knowing least.\r\n\r\nThe charge of living in luxurious surroundings is well enough\r\nfounded--Wagner undoubtedly did love them: he said so himself. What\r\ndid the luxury amount to? A few carpets, chairs, a silk dressing-gown,\r\nand sufficient to eat and drink! He certainly worked hard enough for\r\nthem and had a right to them. It is odd to think that most of those\r\nwho brought these charges against him themselves grasped at as much\r\nluxury as they could get: had King Ludwig spent his money on _them_\r\nthere would have been no objections raised, and doubtless they would\r\nhave given us _Rings_ and _Mastersingers_. This must be the judgment\r\nof every sane person.\r\n\r\nHowever, Wagner settled peacefully at Triebschen, and remained there\r\nuntil the Bayreuth idea took solid and visible shape. He completed the\r\n_Mastersingers_ and _Siegfried_, and made progress with the _Dusk of\r\nthe Gods_. When Minna died in 1868 he immediately married Cosima. The\r\nidea of what ultimately became Bayreuth took shape. Bayreuth was first\r\nthought of for a very prosaic reason. The town theatre at that time\r\npossessed the largest stage in Germany, and in many respects was far\r\nahead of every other German theatre, and this drew the attention of\r\nWagner and his friends to the spot. Various causes combined to make\r\nthe idea of giving the first performances of the _Ring_ in this\r\ntheatre an utter impracticability, and Wagner reverted to his old pet\r\nidea of building a theatre for himself. An eminent architect,\r\nGottfried Semper, cheerfully helped at planning a building which\r\nshould unite the utmost artistic usefulness with the smallest possible\r\nexpense. The house is long out-of-date, but in the 'seventies it\r\nseemed a marvel. The seats were so arranged that every one commanded,\r\ntheoretically, the same view of the stage; the stage was fitted with\r\nthe most modern machinery, lights and so on. The orchestra was sunk,\r\nso that the movements of the conductor and his fiddlers should not\r\ndistract the attention of the audience; the auditorium was darkened,\r\nso that everything happening on the stage could be seen with the\r\ngreatest possible clearness. When the good burghers of a decaying\r\nmediæval town found what was going to happen to them they rejoiced,\r\nfor they foresaw invasions of millions of aliens who would not hurt\r\nthem but would pay out handsomely, and renew the days of the town's\r\nprosperity. Sites were granted free of cost, both for Wagner's own\r\nhouse--Villa Wahnfried--and the Festival Theatre. When the foundation\r\nof the latter was laid, brass bands and processions took an important\r\npart in the proceedings.\r\n\r\nFrom the very start the enterprise was looked on as a commercial one.\r\nWagner's house was built, but work at the theatre had soon to be\r\nstopped for want of money. Numerous Wagner societies were started to\r\nraise it; concerts innumerable were given with the same object; the\r\ncomposer himself laboured incessantly; and eventually it was possible\r\nto resume building. But the very means, or some of the means, adopted\r\nto raise money aroused fierce antagonism amongst the musicians who\r\ndid not believe in Wagner, or had been attacked by him and his\r\ndisciples, and put into their hands a weapon of counter-attack.\r\n\"Begging\" was a term freely employed; and a thousand newspapers were\r\nfound willing--nay, anxious--to insinuate or to state boldly that the\r\nmoney was badly needed to enable the composer to live on a sumptuous\r\nscale. When, in the summer of 1876, the first cycle of the _Ring_ was\r\ngiven, no artistic undertaking could have made a worse start. People\r\ndid not know what they were asked to see and to hear; they did know\r\nthat all these scandalous rumours had been flying about for years,\r\nthat the \"entertainment\" was not ordinary opera, that the opening of\r\nBayreuth was to mark the beginning of a millennium--a new moral,\r\nreligious, political and goodness knows what sort of era. Bayreuth\r\nfrom the first had attracted a very disagreeable set of persons, men\r\nwhom fathers would not allow to speak to their daughters--or to their\r\nsons. Wagner himself had invited ridicule by claiming that his theatre\r\nwas not to be a mere opera-house, but, as he told Sir Charles Hallé,\r\nthe centre of the intellectual and artistic world. \"A noble ambition!\"\r\nscornfully replied the pianist. In a word, nothing was done to\r\nconciliate; everything was done to create resentment and opposition.\r\nKing Ludwig's unpopularity must not be forgotten. Not Bavarians only,\r\nbut all the German-speaking peoples, knew Bavarian national finances\r\nto be in a deplorable, desperate condition, and it seemed to them\r\nscandalous that State funds should be used--as, rightly or wrongly,\r\nwas thought--for Ludwig's own gross, unspeakable pleasures. While the\r\nGermans were thus alienated, Wagner immediately after 1871 had stirred\r\nup the wrath of the French by speaking of the German army as the\r\n\"world-conquerors\"; he had angered the English musicians by the many\r\nremarks concerning them uttered by or attributed to him after his\r\nexploits with the Philharmonic society. He had written against the\r\nJews, and though their finest musicians were with him, the bulk were\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nThat the performances were in many respects admirable, indeed without\r\nany precedent, we are bound to believe. The artists, great and little,\r\nhad toiled for months to attain perfection. Most of the orchestra,\r\nheaded by Wilhelmj, had slaved without payment that there might be no\r\ndeficiencies in their department. The stage machinery, crude though it\r\nseems to us nowadays when we read of it, was on all sides reckoned\r\nmarvellous. Interminable rehearsals had been held, Wagner supervising\r\nthem all. In the end, even the anti-Wagnerites who went to curse,\r\nadmitted that unheard-of results had been achieved: they would not\r\ngive in about the music, which remained, in their crass ears, \"without\r\nform or melody\"; and we may therefore the more readily accept their\r\ntestimony as to Wagner's supremacy as a musical director. The late Mr.\r\nJoseph Bennett's reports--and he was till his last breath a violent\r\nanti-Wagnerite--are typical: they may be read in the files of the\r\n_Daily Telegraph_, and are well worth reading. But, alas! when those\r\nheartless people called accountants came to add up their mysterious\r\nsums and to put figures on the credit side and on the debit side, they\r\nproved incontestably that an appalling deficit was the most obvious\r\nresult of the whole proceedings; and if Wagner had any doubts, the\r\nsteady inflowing tide of bills to be met must have finally convinced\r\nhim. To pay the deficit, dresses and scenery had to be sold; and for a\r\ntime, at any rate, it was clear the theatre could not open again.\r\nWagner, in his old age, had to commence once again giving concerts, in\r\nLondon amongst other places, to raise funds. Ludwig had done much, and\r\ndared go no further. A huge subscription was arranged, and a large\r\namount of money had been collected, when help came from somewhere,\r\nwhereupon the subscriptions were returned. The detractors and\r\nslanderers who had shouted that all the money asked for in the name of\r\nBayreuth was really destined to pay for Wagner's and King Ludwig's own\r\nprivate amusements received, if a vulgar phrase is allowable, a\r\nviolent blow in their noisy mouths. Wagner paid no further heed to\r\nthem, but went on working out his plans. The old dream referred to in\r\nhis letters to Uhlig had been realised; he had his ideal theatre, he\r\nhad given ideal performances, and he reckoned he had given the Germans\r\nan art. And now let us see what that art was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n'THE NIBELUNG'S RING' AND 'THE RHINEGOLD'\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIn the case of few artists is there an account of the creation of\r\ntheir works worth serious consideration. In the colloquial as well as\r\nthe true sense of the word they are apt to be imaginative, and such a\r\nstory as Edgar Allen Poe's of the composition of the _Raven_ is not so\r\nmuch imaginative as imaginary. The creative artist is usually the last\r\nman in the world to give a veracious history of the genesis of his\r\ncreations, for the simple reason that he does not know, and, during\r\nthe later process of trying to find out, for his own private\r\nsatisfaction, he is given to invent theories--or, let us say,\r\nhypotheses--which eventually he may come to believe pure fact. In\r\nmusic the act of creation is often done in a hypnotic state. Goethe\r\nmentions that his earlier songs were written in a state of\r\nclairvoyance. Many much more recent poets seem to have achieved their\r\nhugest popular successes whilst in a comatose state. Some, who also\r\nmanaged to secure a success with the public, apparently conceived and\r\nexecuted their mighty works in a state of hallucination--having\r\nsomehow got the idea into their heads that they were poets. Handel,\r\nMozart and Beethoven are three musicians who are known--if history may\r\nbe at all believed--to have composed in a hypnotic state: Handel would\r\nsit for hours, unconscious of what went on around him; Mozart could\r\nnot be trusted with a knife at dinner--when he had a dinner; Beethoven\r\nwould pour cold water over his hands until the tenants beneath raised\r\nviolent objections. No such tales are related of Bach, of Haydn, of\r\nGluck, of Weber, nor of Wagner. If ever a man knew precisely what he\r\nhad been doing, even if he was not self-conscious at the moment of\r\ndoing it, that man was Wagner. He stands apart, therefore; apart from\r\nsome of the greatest composers. His case, I take it, is analogous to\r\nthat of a man who cannot remember a friend's address and thinks of it\r\nthat night in a dream: how he chances to dream he cannot tell, but he\r\nknows what he has dreamt, and when.\r\n\r\nIt is worth insisting on this, partly because it is eminently\r\ncharacteristic of Wagner, partly because it enables us now to trace\r\nwith some certainty the growth of the _Nibelung's Ring_, both drama\r\nand music, from its birth to its final execution. The history of the\r\nbuilding-up of the drama, like the drama itself, is a mightily\r\ncomplicated and entangled matter. Some of it had to be related earlier\r\nin this book to account, so to say, for the way in which Wagner filled\r\nup his days; but it will be convenient to summarise it here. Let us\r\nbegin with a few dates--\r\n\r\n1848. Had studied the Nibelungen saga and\r\nsketched the plan of the whole gigantic\r\n      work much as it now stands.\r\n\r\n1850-51. Discusses _Siegfried's Death_ in letters\r\n      to Uhlig and Liszt. Begins the poem in\r\n      another form, which he abandons.\r\n\r\n1852. Writes the poem for the work practically in\r\n      its final form; privately printed the\r\n      following year.\r\n\r\n1853. Begins _Rhinegold_.\r\n\r\n1854. Completes _Rhinegold_.\r\n      Begins the _Valkyrie_, and sketches _Siegfried_\r\n      at the same time.\r\n\r\n1856. Completes _Valkyrie_.\r\n      Begins composition of _Siegfried_.\r\n      Completes first and begins second act of\r\n      _Siegfried_, and interrupts it to start work\r\n      on _Tristan_.\r\n\r\n1859. _Tristan_ completed.\r\n\r\n1867. _Mastersingers_ completed.\r\n      Composition of _Siegfried_ resumed.\r\n      _Siegfried_ completed.\r\n      _Dusk of the Gods_ begun.\r\n      _Dusk of the Gods_ completed.\r\n\r\n1876. The _Ring_ given at Bayreuth.\r\n\r\nWagner was thus occupied with the _Ring_ for fully twenty-five years.\r\nThe _Rhinegold_ followed _Lohengrin_, but there was a gap of five\r\nyears between them, mainly devoted to literary work (1848-53); and\r\nduring that period his whole style in music underwent a vast change.\r\nIn one respect the change is not so marked as that between the\r\n_Rhine__gold_ and the _Valkyrie_; in the first there is little of the\r\npassion, strength, grip and breadth of the others. While composing the\r\n_Rhinegold_ his powers were developing at a prodigious rate, and had\r\nthe _Rhinegold_ been a better subject for the purpose they might have\r\nreached maturity while writing it. But there is no human element in\r\nit, and without that Wagner could not get on. We have already seen\r\nthat he abandoned the idea of the _Mastersingers_ for years--until, in\r\nfact, he had created a soul for Sachs: then he went ahead and gave us\r\na series of magnificent pictures of old Nuremberg. In the same way,\r\nthough he wrote some fine music in the _Rhinegold_, in richness,\r\nsplendour of colouring, it does not compare with the _Valkyrie_, where\r\nhe is chiefly concerned with two human beings and a being who must be\r\ncalled only a demi-goddess, half-goddess and half-human. He could not\r\ncompose unless he had the double inspiration, the human soul and the\r\npictorial environment. If I had to select three of Wagner's works to\r\nlive with I should take the _Valkyrie_, _Tristan_ and the\r\n_Mastersingers_. In them we find inspiration and craftmanship in\r\nabsolute proportion; in the later dramas of the _Ring_ we shall see\r\nhow craftsmanship outran inspiration--sometimes with results that can\r\nonly be called deplorable. This matter must be reserved for discussion\r\nuntil we deal with the operas separately.\r\n\r\nThe labyrinthine libretto owes its defects not to the many years it\r\ntook to write--for when once Wagner set to work it was done in a\r\nsingle breath--but to the nature of the subject and the very German way\r\nin which a German composer inevitably felt impelled to treat that\r\nsubject. In Chapter X, p. 193 and onward, the reader will recollect\r\ncertain letters: I beg him, before going further, to turn back to\r\nthese and mark with care Wagner's own story of the growth of this\r\ngigantic opera. The letter on p. 227 is most characteristic of a\r\nGerman. _Siegfried's Death_ did not explain enough, so an explanation\r\nhad to be offered; that explanation needed explaining, so a second\r\nexplanation was made; this left matters in as unsatisfactory a state\r\nas ever, so, finally, the first opera of the four, the _Rhinegold_,\r\nwas written--and with that Wagner mercifully stopped. He had set\r\nhimself a task simply appalling in the demands it must needs make on\r\nhis time and creative energy; moreover, he had set himself a task just\r\nas hard in the demands it made on his stage-craft. The four dramas\r\ncould not but overlap, and they do overlap to such an extent that in\r\nthe very near future \"cuts\" will be made freely to eliminate\r\nrepetitions which have even now grown a weariness to the flesh. The\r\npoem--or, more properly, the four opera-books--must now be summarised,\r\nand I will endeavour to avoid imitation of Wagner by not going over\r\nthe same ground twice, or more than twice.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe central figure of the _Ring_, considered as a whole, is Wotan. He\r\nis absolute lord of earth and heaven as long as his luck lasts. The\r\nluck lasts no longer than is determined, not by the hours, but by some\r\nmysterious something, some unfathomable mystery of a power, behind the\r\nhours. When the hour strikes, his stately home in the heavens shall be\r\nrolled up like a scroll, shall be consumed in flames; Wotan and the\r\nminor gods shall perish; a new start shall be made in the world. Now,\r\nthis idea of the old saga is clearly enough a way of stating, in the\r\nguise of a story, a simple historical fact, that with the coming of\r\nthe White Christ the old deities were driven out. There is no drama\r\ninherent in it: for the drama Wagner went to the explanatory story of\r\nhow the _dénouement_ came about, of the causes which brought it about,\r\nwhich, with the self-contradictoriness of most of those primitive\r\nattempts to account for the mystery of the world, were not causes at\r\nall, but only incidents by the way, since the catastrophe had been\r\narranged for since the beginning of time. The main cause (in this\r\nsense) is Wotan's lust for power, and Wagner reads it thus: since to\r\nhold and exercise this power compels Wotan to do things which are a\r\nviolence to his best nature, to thrust love from him, he voluntarily\r\nabdicates and calmly awaits the end. He first makes several struggles\r\nto keep the power while shifting its responsibilities, and these form\r\nthe subject of three of the four dramas.\r\n\r\nThe power is symbolised by the gold of the Rhine; this gold, made into\r\na Ring--the _Nibelung's Ring_--gives absolute power to its possessor.\r\nIt is accursed; the curse being what I have just mentioned--that the\r\npower cannot be exercised without its possessor doing violence to his\r\nnature, thereby destroying that nature. Wotan thinks if an absolutely\r\nfree agent, a hero owing nothing to any one, bound by no conditions,\r\ncould gain this Ring, his power might be preserved: he might defy even\r\nFate, since no conditions were attached to the possession of it. He\r\nmakes the initial mistake when he determines to raise up such a hero:\r\nthe hero's act is as much Wotan's as if Wotan had himself committed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAfter this description of the main dramatic motive of the _Ring_,\r\nthose--if there are any now alive--who are unfamiliar with the work\r\nmay have no desire to see it, whilst those who know it may imagine\r\nthat I am purposely misrepresenting it. I beg both classes of readers\r\nto be patient. If this were the whole _Ring_ it would indeed be a\r\nbarren, bleak and desolate affair. This is nothing more than the frame\r\nwhich contains the dramas which make the _Ring_ the great work it\r\nis--the dramas with their wealth of passion and colour, their hundred\r\nvaried emotions and scenes of love and tragedy. Before proceeding to\r\ndeal with them separately, let me again mention one point. There is\r\nthe flat contradiction between the Wotan who knows that when the\r\nmoment arrives his reign must automatically end, and the Wotan who\r\nhopes to go on reigning by getting possession of the Ring through the\r\nagency of a fearless hero who has struck no bargain with the powers\r\nwho are stronger than the gods. That contradiction is inherent in the\r\nsaga, and had Wagner been able to eliminate it--as he tried by diving\r\nthrough the saga and to the myth behind--the very essence and\r\natmosphere of the drama would have been eliminated also. The idea of\r\npredetermined destiny colours that drama throughout; the whole thing\r\nmight be the old Scandinavian way of stating a problem older than\r\nScandinavia, that of free-will and predestination.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe curtain rises, and we are in the depths of the Rhine; water-nymphs\r\nsport about; Alberich, an evil being of the river, tries in vain to\r\ncatch them. The water grows brighter with the rising of the sun, and\r\nthe Rhinegold is seen to glow on the summit of a high rock. Defeated\r\nin his attempts to capture a nymph, Alberich scales the rock, seizes\r\nthe gold and makes off with it. The silly creatures have told him that\r\ntheir innocent toy, shaped into a ring, would confer upon its\r\npossessor power to rule the whole world, on condition that he\r\nsurrendered love; and love being something Alberich is incapable of\r\nunderstanding, though he is amorous enough, he willingly pays the\r\nprice for the sake of the power--that is, the power costs him nothing.\r\nThe light-giving gold being raped, darkness falls on the river.\r\n\r\nThe next scene is on a plateau; beyond it lies the valley of the\r\nRhine; further off is a mountain; light mists hover over the summit;\r\nand, as they clear away in the early morning sunshine, a gorgeous\r\ncastle, Valhalla, gradually becomes visible. Wotan and Fricka his\r\nwife lie in slumber. Fricka wakes first, and is startled, not to say\r\nhorrified, by the apparition. The Giants, Fasolt and Fafner, have\r\nbuilt the castle, and the promised payment is Freia, Fricka's sister,\r\nwhose apples all gods and goddesses must eat every day, else they will\r\nfade and perish. Fricka tries to awaken Wotan: in his dreams he talks\r\nof endless, omnipotent power, and of his castle, to be peopled by\r\nheroes to fight for him against the brute forces of the earth. When he\r\nis aroused he gazes at the building in deepest joy: _now_ his ambition\r\nwill be gratified. In vain Fricka expostulates, repeating (in homely\r\nphrase), \"What about Freia?\" Wotan smiles a superior smile: he has\r\narranged that matter, and all will be well.\r\n\r\nThis is the beginning of Wotan's tragedy, the huge drama of which the\r\nothers constitute the working out. From this scene to the end we are\r\nto see Wotan gradually forced into a corner. He has to learn by slow\r\ndegrees that you cannot have anything without paying the price. It is\r\nin vain he argues with Fricka. She stands for law--inexorable law. She\r\nseems a disagreeable woman, and it would be much more pleasant for\r\neverybody concerned if she could be induced to hold her tongue and let\r\nthings take their course. So is what we call the law of gravitation a\r\ndisagreeable thing; all the same, we know that if we fall off a\r\nhouse-roof we shall break our necks. In the Scandinavian cosmogony\r\nWotan holds sway only by treaties, bargains struck with the powers\r\nthat only sustain him so long as he sticks to his word, and are\r\ncapable of thrusting him down if he breaks his word. Even omnipotence\r\nmay be bought too dearly, and Wotan is not destined to taste the\r\nsweets of even a quarter of an hour's omnipotence. In vain he tries to\r\nevade responsibility, to get something for nothing; and his tragedy is\r\nconsummated when in _Siegfried_ he realises that omnipotence can never\r\nbe his. Then he renounces it.\r\n\r\nThis is by way of being a digression; but, for a clear understanding\r\nof this main drama of the _Ring_, it is absolutely necessary that we\r\nshould see the source of Wotan's troubles, and here it is: that Fricka\r\nwill not allow him, figuratively, to jump off a house-top without\r\nbreaking his neck. What she tells him swiftly proves true. Freia flies\r\nin, pursued by the Giants, who demand to be paid. \"You rule by\r\ntreaties alone,\" they say. Wotan looks anxiously round for Loge, the\r\ntreacherous god of fire and lies. He has promised to find something\r\nthat the Giants will accept instead of Freia; and when he enters he\r\nconfesses to failure--there is nothing, in the estimation of an\r\nearth-born creature, that is equal to a woman. But he tells of the\r\ntheft of the gold; the Giants listen greedily, and they agree to take\r\nit, if Wotan can get it, instead of Freia. Wotan has a double motive:\r\nhe does not want all the gold, or, indeed, any of it, save the Ring\r\nshaped by the Nibelung; that he determines to grasp, else the Nibelung\r\nwill become _his_ master. He has trusted to lies and trickery, and has\r\nbeen swindled; but so overpowering is his thirst for universal rule\r\nthat he again trusts himself to Loge. The Giants hold Freia as a\r\nhostage; presently all the gods begin to lapse into a comatose\r\nstate--they have not eaten of her apples that day--and in desperation\r\nLoge and Wotan set out for the Nibelung's abode. The Nibelungs are the\r\nslaves and sons of toil; they labour incessantly for Alberich; him\r\nonly does Wotan fear: he must get the Ring from them at all costs. The\r\npair descend into the Nibelung's cave. The Ring is already forged, and\r\nthe Tarnhelm--the cap of invisibility--is made which enables him to\r\nrender himself invisible or to change himself into any animal he\r\nwishes. By a trick Wotan gets Alberich into his power, carries him to\r\nthe upper earth, and only lets him go free after he has surrendered\r\nTarnhelm, Ring and all the hoard of gold. Then the turn of the Giants\r\ncomes. The pile of gold they demand must hide Freia from sight; and in\r\nthe end she can still be seen, and Wotan must sacrifice the one thing\r\nprecious to him, the Ring. That is accursed, and no sooner have Fafner\r\nand Fasolt got it than they quarrel; Fafner kills Fasolt, and goes off\r\nwith all to change himself into a dragon and to hide himself in a\r\ncavern with his treasure. Wotan, in his extremity, has summoned Erda,\r\nthe wisdom of the earth, and she has counselled him to give up the\r\nRing, and it is with horror that he sees how wise she was. But his\r\nambition is boundless; he cannot give up the idea of reigning supreme;\r\nand when things seem at their worst he has a sudden inspiration--that,\r\nalready mentioned, of raising up a hero who will freely take the Ring\r\nfrom Fafner, and, by letting Wotan have it, free of treaties, enable\r\nhim to reign supreme. The thought is told us only in the music, and\r\nin the music only in the light of the later operas of the series. Then\r\nthe gods cross a rainbow bridge, somewhat hastily thrown up by Donner,\r\nthe god of storms, and enter Valhalla; and underneath the dreary wail\r\nof the Rhinemaidens is heard as they lament their loss. With this the\r\n_Rhinegold_ closes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nNow let us consider the music of the _Rhinegold._\r\n\r\nAlready the discrepancy of styles has been referred to. The\r\n_Rhinegold_, coming between _Lohengrin_ and _Tristan_, suffers from an\r\nodd sort of pettiness of phrase--a pettiness which in all probability\r\nwe should not feel if we did not judge it by _Tristan_. The wide sweep\r\nof the tide of music that we find in the _Valkyrie_ is absent; there\r\nis a tendency to shorten the measures, a hesitation between boldly\r\ngoing on, as in his later manner, and the symmetrical four-bar\r\nmeasures of _Tannhäuser_ and _Lohengrin_. The opening of the second\r\nscene is in structure that of a Handel opera air: we have the\r\nritornello, and presently the same music is repeated as the\r\naccompaniment of Wotan's salute to his castle. This smallness of\r\ndesign, it must be remembered, is only comparative: compared with\r\nanything of the sort done before, the design is big and broad. The\r\nWagner of the _Valkyrie_, of _Tristan_ and of the _Mastersingers_, has\r\nnot acquired full mastery of his new art; there are still plenty of\r\nfull closes, and, though words are not repeated, the effect at times\r\nwould hardly be more conventional if they were.\r\n\r\nBut in all the music we have the first-fruits of Wagner's walks\r\namongst the Swiss mountains. When he sent the book of the _Ring_ to\r\nSchopenhauer, that crotchety critic wrote in it that it seemed mainly\r\nconcerned with clouds; and truly it very largely is. The _Rhinegold_\r\nends with a storm, the flash of lightning and the roar of thunder; in\r\neach Act of the _Valkyrie_ there is a storm; the Third Act of\r\n_Siegfried_ opens with a storm; there is one storm in the _Dusk of the\r\nGods_. Wind screaming through the pines, the plash of rain, the\r\ndriving of thunder-clouds--these are the pictorial inspiration of the\r\n_Ring_ as surely as old Nuremberg is the pictorial inspiration of the\r\n_Mastersingers_. These Scandinavian gods are the divinities of river\r\nand wood and mountain, and Wagner made full use of them. The _Ring_ is\r\nfar too lengthy, and the main drama is apt to get forgotten; the\r\nrepetitions, due to Wagner's desire not to let it be forgotten, are\r\nwearisome. But one thing can never be forgotten--the sense of the open\r\nair, the freshness of nature, the loveliness and health of the green\r\nearth: that sense keeps the gigantic, overgrown thing sweet and an\r\nendless delight.\r\n\r\nThe opening is as sublime in its simplicity as the first bars of the\r\n_Lohengrin_ prelude. As the curtain rises on the depths of the Rhine,\r\n\"greenish twilight, lighter above, darker below,\" the lowest E flat\r\nbooms softly out (it has to be done by an organ pedal-pipe), the deep\r\nvoice of the river as it rolls massively on its course towards the\r\nsea; and the effect is overwhelming. A theme then makes its appearance\r\nin its first vague form, a theme which in one shape or another Wagner\r\nuses throughout the four operas for the elemental beings--here, the\r\nwater nymphs, afterwards Erda. The mass of tone swells out; the music\r\nbecomes more active; and at last the voices of the Rhinemaidens are\r\nheard. The whole of this is one of Wagner's most delightful things. It\r\nis another illustration of his rule that a composer should never leave\r\na key as long as he can say what he wants while staying in it; for\r\nsome hundreds of bars there is no change, and then only a slight one.\r\nWith the entry of Alberich modulations begin. Here we have the\r\nwonderful inventive Wagner: that figure, in the inner part of the\r\nmusical tissue, would alone stamp him as a great composer: the\r\ncomposer who could invent such a theme could not possibly be a small\r\ncomposer. The mock-coaxing of the nymphs might be a parody of the\r\nVenusberg scene in _Tannhäuser_; and later on there occurs a passage\r\nthat might be a parody on parts of _Tristan_. When Alberich steals the\r\ngold we get that degenerate form of the Valhalla theme repeated again\r\nand again, and the full effect of the device is only felt when, with\r\nthe change of scene, we hear the passage in all its nobility and\r\nsplendour. Wotan's greeting to his new castle is rather grandiose than\r\nreally fine: one feels the theatrical baritone; one feels also that\r\nthe quality of homeliness which makes Sachs a great character is sadly\r\nlacking. In the _Valkyrie_ this unpretentiousness, so to speak, is\r\nalways present, and the music gains proportionately in\r\nimpressiveness. Wotan's opening phrase, grand and sweeping though it\r\nis, somehow evokes a vision of an Italian opera baritone expanding his\r\nchest, with arms extended in the direction of the more expensive\r\nseats: this is neither the mighty Wotan of the _Valkyrie_, nor even of\r\nthe underground scene in this opera.\r\n\r\nNor is the vocal writing, in another respect, that of the greatest\r\nWagner. I have already spoken of the perfect fusion of vocal and\r\norchestral parts which we find in _Tristan_ and the _Mastersingers_.\r\nTo that perfection Wagner had not attained when he began the _Ring_;\r\nand much of this first speech of Wotan consists of notes written\r\nsimply to fit in with the Valhalla theme. That theme shows traces of\r\nits descent from the Alberich motive--the greed for power--in that it\r\ndoes not bear real development, but only variation; it is, in fact,\r\nnot a musical subject in the sense in which, say, the _Tristan_\r\nsubjects are musical subjects, but is, properly speaking, a figure.\r\nBut shaped to a stately rhythm and richly harmonised, and moreover\r\ngorgeously orchestrated, it glitters with sufficient magnificence.\r\nFricka's remonstrances are at first querulous, but with the passage\r\nbeginning \"Um des Gatten Treue besorgt\" we get one of Wagner's\r\nmatchless bits of lovely melody. The entry of Freia, flying from the\r\nGiants, is theatrically effective, and here we find for the first time\r\nthe phrase, already alluded to in the chapter on _Tristan_, which\r\nthroughout the _Ring_ is made to serve so many purposes. In this scene\r\nI still feel the halting between the _Lohengrin_ style and later, the\r\nindecision--nay, the uncertainty--in the handling of the musical\r\nmaterial. There are no regular four-bar measures and full closes as in\r\nthe earlier work; but a great deal is nothing more than dry recitative\r\ndisguised. The first scene of the _Rhinegold_ is purely symphonic:\r\neven if Alberich's spasmodic, jerky exclamations seem to be written in\r\nto fit the nature of this being, his whole mode of speech--harsh,\r\nunmusical--renders the fact less glaring; and the tide of music flows\r\nsteadily on, reaching climax upon climax, until the final crash when\r\nhe disappears with the gold. Wagner did not find it possible to get\r\nthis continuity when he came to set to music the arguments amongst\r\nWotan, Fricka and Freia: there are short cantilenas, but they are\r\nconstantly broken by recitative.\r\n\r\nWith the entry of the Giants the music makes, so to say, a fresh\r\nstart. The old themes are welded to or interwoven with new material,\r\nand a perfect symphonic whole results, one that can be listened to\r\nwith delight without stage accessories. I do not mean that music\r\nintended for the theatre should stand the test of playing away from\r\nthe theatre, but that here Wagner, while writing strictly and\r\nimmensely effective theatre music, has got such a grip of his art that\r\nhe can combine the two things, dramatic truth, and symphonic beauty\r\nand cohesion. The flood sweeps on, undisturbed in its flow by the\r\nentry of the other deities, or by the introduction of themes full of\r\nsignificance in the light of their after development. But another fact\r\nmust not go unnoticed. There is in the _Rhinegold_ little of the\r\nspring freshness of the _Valkyrie_. The melody associated with\r\nFreia's apples is supremely beautiful; but it is a mere short phrase,\r\nseveral times repeated, and the mass of music in which it is embedded\r\nsmells more of the study and the lamp than of the mountains and the\r\nwoods. The Froh theme, too, is a trifle flat: it does not effervesce\r\nor sparkle: the \"dewy splendour\" of the _Valkyrie_ music is not on it.\r\nThis is not to be hypercritical: it is to compare, as one must, a\r\ngreat achievement with an achievement in all respects very much,\r\nimmeasurably, greater. Had we only the _Rhinegold_, with all its\r\nplentiful lack of inspiration and its theatricality, it would rank\r\nvery high; but Wagner himself in the _Valkyrie_ set the standard by\r\nwhich inevitably it must be judged.\r\n\r\nWhen Wotan and Loge descend to the Nibelung's cave to steal the\r\ntreasure Wagner frankly lets himself loose. Here we have the\r\nhobgoblins of the Teutonic imagination and the rude, boisterous,\r\nhumorous Wotan of the Scandinavian imagination--the Odin who tried to\r\ndrink the sea dry and laughed to find he could not. As the\r\nonce-celebrated Sir Augustus Harris declared, \"This is pantomime.\"\r\nPerhaps the scene is unduly protracted, but the music goes on merrily\r\nenough. The renewed altercation with the Giants calls for little\r\nremark. When, however, the Giants demand the Ring and Wotan calls up\r\nErda, the wisdom of the earth, a passage occurs which, though more or\r\nless of an irrelevant interpolation, gives Wagner a chance of putting\r\nforth his strength. Erda rises to most mysterious music, counsels\r\nWotan to surrender the Ring, and sinks down again to her sleep; and\r\none forgets the irrelevancy in the thrill of this vision of the Mother\r\nEarth, the spirit that sleeps amongst the everlasting hills. Finally\r\nthe composer gets his great chance, and shows that, like Handel and\r\nhis own Donner, he \"could strike like a thunderbolt.\" The gods are all\r\ndisheartened; mists have gathered; Donner--our old friend Thor--raises\r\nhis hammer and smashes something; there is a flash of lightning and a\r\npeal of thunder; the mists and clouds clear away; and we see there the\r\nrainbow bridge over which the gods wend on their way to Valhalla. We\r\nhave Wagner the sublime pictorial musician. The Rainbow motive is\r\nperhaps not very graphic in itself, but it serves as a basis for a\r\ndelicious passage--evening calm and sunset after storm--comparable\r\nonly with a parallel passage in Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony. The\r\nstorm itself is Wagner in the plenitude of his power. It is short: it\r\nis not \"worked up\": in a few strokes, brief and telling as Donner's\r\nown hammer-strokes, the whole thing is done. Then the Valhalla music,\r\nglorified by a gorgeous accompaniment, is heard again, only\r\ninterrupted by the wail of the Rhinemaidens below, sorrowing for the\r\nloss of their pretty, harmless toy. Wotan hears the cry, and passes on\r\nto feast in his castle. Grim care goes with him; but he has the\r\nconsoling idea of the free hero and the irresistible sword. So ends\r\nthe _Rhinegold_--Fricka content to have both Wotan and Freia; the\r\nother gods not much concerned about anything; Wotan full of\r\napprehensions and also of determination--determination to rule without\r\npaying the price of rulership.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nI have attempted nothing more than a broad and rough description of\r\nthe _Rhinegold_. The opera was planned as a prelude, and suffers from\r\nthe defects of the plan, as well as from the fact that it was written\r\nbefore Wagner's new method was ripe. He wrote to Liszt that the music\r\ncame up \"like wild,\" or, as an irreverent critic once observed, like\r\nmould on a pot of jam; and the second description is truer than the\r\nspeaker thought. The _Rhinegold_ has aged faster than any other of the\r\ngreat works. Alongside of the sublime we find the petty; after phrases\r\nas sweet and fresh as raindrops on young spring leaves we find stodgy,\r\n\"made,\" music; the atmosphere is not preserved. But gigantic\r\npossibilities are opened out. The Rhine music is afterwards used to\r\nsplendid ends; the Spear motive, which makes its first appearance in\r\nrather a trivial form--it might be a quotation from Weber or\r\nSpohr--becomes later one of the crowning glories of the _Ring_; the\r\nFire music--the Loge theme--comes out at once in its full\r\nmagnificence. It is fair criticism to say that had Wagner written the\r\nopera again after finishing the _Valkyrie_ he might have wrought up\r\nhis material into a perfect work of art. A mere mortal, even the\r\ngreatest mortal, could hardly be expected to attempt the task, and the\r\n_Rhinegold_ is a little less than perfect. Moreover, it is\r\nsuperfluous. We can follow the _Valkyrie_, _Siegfried_ and the _Dusk\r\nof the Gods_ quite well without it. Still, it is a part of Wagner's\r\nscheme, and for many a long year will be enjoyed for its power and\r\nbeauty, a power and beauty that seem small only in comparison with the\r\ngreater operas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n'THE VALKYRIE'\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe _Rhinegold_ suffers from a plethora of undeveloped themes, some of\r\nwhich are treated at length as the _Ring_ proceeds. Of all announced\r\nonly two remain unchanged, the Valhalla and the Fire themes. The\r\nfirst, I have just remarked, is not susceptible of development, and is\r\nonly slightly varied throughout the _Ring_; the second does not demand\r\ndevelopment, but is varied much as Beethoven varied his melodies in\r\nhis last pianoforte sonatas. The most important of those that are\r\nmetamorphosed is the Spear motive. The Spear is the symbol at once of\r\nWotan's sovereignty and of his bondage. On its shaft, the world\r\nash-tree stem, are graven the mystic laws by virtue of which he rules;\r\ndid he break these laws his power would be gone from him. The essence\r\nof the laws lies in the sanctity of compacts, and so we first hear its\r\nrepresentative theme when the Giants come to claim Freia as payment\r\nfor the building of the Burg: it makes its appearance quietly,\r\nunobtrusively, almost apologetically, and might be, as I have said, a\r\nfragment from Spohr or Weber. Its treatment in a simple snatch of\r\ntwo-part canon, one part following the other at half-a-bar's distance,\r\nseems like a mild gibe at those who only live for and by conventions.\r\nWhen it reappears in the Second Act of the _Valkyrie_ it is\r\naltogether a different thing: here we have Wotan the ruler determined\r\nat all costs to rule and using to the full the power the Spear confers\r\non him. Like many of the greatest musical subjects, it is simple\r\nbeyond the daring of the minor composers, merely an unbroken scale\r\ndescending in heavy, emphatic steps to the lower octaves: it is\r\nauthority personified, will that brooks no opposition. This motive,\r\nthe Valhalla motive and the fire motive are the principal ones carried\r\ninto the _Valkyrie_ from the _Rhinegold_; and an immense amount of new\r\nmusical matter is introduced. We see no more of the inferior deities:\r\nwe hear the stroke of Donner's hammer in a storm _Lied_, and Loge\r\nappears as consuming flame in the last act; but, excepting Wotan, only\r\nFricka is seen again in human shape. The stage is now occupied by\r\nhuman beings, raised up, it is true, by Wotan himself, and by some\r\nother mysterious beings, also raised up by Wotan, one of whom, _the_\r\nValkyrie, Brünnhilda, is condemned in the final scene to become human.\r\n\r\nTwo dramas, the huge encircling tragedy of Wotan in conflict with his\r\nwife Fricka, the goddess of laws and covenants, especially the\r\ncovenant of marriage, and the subsidiary tragedy of Siegmund and\r\nSieglinda, are combined in perfect proportions in the _Valkyrie_. The\r\nstory at first sounds a little complicated; but the reader, bearing in\r\nmind what has already been said of Wotan's Master-idea, can have no\r\ndifficulty whatever in following it. The Master-idea, we know, is to\r\nraise up a hero who, acting freely, independent of and ever defying\r\nthe gods, will wrest the Ring from Fafner. Wotan, then, has descended\r\nfrom his Valhalla, and, taking an earthly wife, begotten two children,\r\nSiegmund and Sieglinda, who know themselves to be of the tribe of the\r\nVolsungs. These he deserts. Sieglinda is taken captive and made the\r\nloveless wife of Hunding; Siegmund, alone in the world, wanders hither\r\nand thither, meeting ill-luck everywhere--ill-luck prepared by his\r\nfather. At last, in attempting to rescue a maiden from some raiders,\r\nhe is forced to fly. As he runs through the depths of an unknown\r\nforest a storm breaks upon him, and he takes shelter, utterly\r\nexhausted, in the house of Hunding. At this point the curtain rises.\r\n\r\nThe scene is the inside of Hunding's dwelling, built round a great\r\nash-tree; on the right the fire burns on the hearth. The steady roar\r\nof the storm outside is heard, broken by shocks as the wind buffets\r\nthe trees and the house and by the plashing of the rain. The room is\r\nempty; presently the door is roughly dashed open from outside and\r\nSiegmund staggers in. \"Whatever this house may be, I must rest here,\"\r\nhe says, and throws himself on the hearth. (We must bear in mind that\r\nthe hearth was sacred: if my enemy took refuge on mine I might starve\r\nhim out, but so long as he stayed there I might not hurt him.)\r\nSieglinda enters; the two do not recognise one another; he calls for\r\nwater; she brings him mead. Presently they fall to talking; and it is\r\nseen that the inevitable must happen. Hunding enters abruptly; they\r\nsit down to supper; Siegmund discloses his identity, so far as he\r\nknows it--all but his name; Hunding recognises the very man he has\r\nbeen chasing, and gives him shelter for the night, but warns him that\r\nin the morning he, without a weapon, must fight. He calls for his\r\nnight-draught, sends Sieglinda into the sleeping-room, and follows\r\nher. She glances repeatedly from Siegmund to a spot on the ash-trunk;\r\nbut he does not take her meaning.\r\n\r\nThere follows a strange and beautiful scene. Siegmund lies down to\r\nrest; the fire glimmers fitfully, then blazes up, revealing at the\r\npoint on the trunk at which Sieglinda had gazed a shining sword-hilt,\r\nthe blade embedded in the trunk. Still Siegmund does not understand,\r\nand the fire dies down; he is beginning to slumber when Sieglinda\r\nenters and calls him. He starts up; she has put a sleeping-powder in\r\nHunding's cup, and they are safe; and thus begins the greatest\r\nlove-duet, next to the _Tristan_, in the world. Sieglinda tells how\r\nwhen she, full of grief, was wedded to Hunding, a grey old man, with\r\none eye, clad in a blue cloak, came in uninvited, drove the sword\r\nNothung into the ash-tree, and said that it should belong to the hero\r\nstrong enough to draw it out. From all parts warriors came, but none\r\ncould move it. Sieglinda feels that the appointed man has come;\r\nSiegmund grasps the weapon and triumphantly pulls it out. Then they\r\nreveal their names, and recognise one another as brother and sister,\r\nand the Act ends.\r\n\r\nThis is the first step towards Wotan's discomfiture. The significance\r\nof the Sword theme in the _Rhinegold_ at the moment when he has the\r\nMaster-idea will now be apparent. The sword was so endowed by Wotan\r\nthat only a fearless hero could use it; therefore, when Siegmund draws\r\nit from the wood, Wotan, watching from Valhalla, knows he has\r\nsucceeded in raising up the hero he needed. Siegmund had been tested\r\nby all manner of misfortune; no harder life could have been his; Wotan\r\nhad never aided him, but thrown disasters in his path; and had he\r\nfailed or succumbed Wotan's device would have failed. But freely,\r\nindependently, with no help from the god, he had come through all, and\r\nnow his own strength enabled him to take the sword to--to what?--to\r\nwork Wotan's will! That is, in creating Siegmund, even in testing him,\r\nin preparing for him a weapon that none could stand against, Wotan,\r\nfar from successfully accomplishing his purpose, was accomplishing his\r\nruin. Disillusionment comes swiftly. The first deed of his hero is to\r\nbreak two of the most sacred laws of heaven--laws binding on Wotan\r\nuntil he gets the Ring--for he carries off another man's wife, who is,\r\nmoreover, his own sister. The punishment for that is matter for the\r\nnext Act. At the end of the first we have seen that Wotan's\r\nMaster-idea is a delusion. He might as well go and kill Fafner himself\r\nand take the Ring as breed a hero to do it for him with the aid of a\r\nmagic sword. If he did so it would be by virtue of the power conferred\r\non him by the runes on the Spear; and by those runes--those\r\nlaws--Siegmund must be, and is, promptly judged and punished.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nBefore the rising of the curtain we have the first and one of the\r\ngreatest of the ear-pictures of the _Valkyrie_. There is no preamble;\r\nat once the strings begin in repeated quavers to sustain (virtually) a\r\nlong D, while the basses start off with a figure many times\r\nrepeated--a figure which is simply a bold variant of the bass figure\r\nin Schubert's _Erl-king_. So, for that matter, is the long D. Schubert\r\ndrew a fine picture of storm in black wood; but he was limited by the\r\nform he wrote in and the instruments he wrote for. The energy,\r\nsuperhuman energy, of the thing is amazing: the storm throbs in the\r\nforest: one feels the pulse of the storm-god; the _sforzando_ shocks\r\nand shrieks add to the terrific wildness of the scene. Pitilessly,\r\never higher and higher, the wind shrieks, always to that beating bass,\r\nuntil, amid the clatter and screaming, we hear Donner, exulting in his\r\nmad strength and swinging his mighty hammer as he rides. The lightning\r\ncrackles vividly in the orchestra, the thunder rolls, crashes and\r\ngrowls, and the thunder-god can almost be heard betaking himself off\r\nto continue his riot afar. Then a labouring, panting and struggling\r\nphrase--scarcely a theme--is heard as the storm slightly lulls; the\r\ncurtain rises and we see Hunding's dwelling, and Siegmund bursts in.\r\n\r\nThe music of the earlier portion of the first scene is not of the same\r\nintrinsic quality, nor need it be. We have the setting before our\r\neyes, and the stupendous power of what has just been heard leaves in\r\nour minds a vivid impression of what is going on out of doors.\r\nSieglinda comes in, surprised to find a stranger there at all,\r\nespecially on so wild a night; Siegmund asks for water; she brings it;\r\nfinding he is likely to fetch trouble on her head, he is for going.\r\nBut there is sympathy between them, and various Volsung motives and\r\nphrases of the rarest beauty and expressiveness tell us why; and she\r\ntells him to wait. \"Hunding I will await here,\" says Siegmund. It is\r\nin this scene that a passage occurs like one which I have referred to\r\nin the chapter on the _Dutchman_--the phrase is marked (_f_) on p.\r\n118. The _Dutchman_ phrase is longer and at the same time less\r\npoignant; here it is brief and extraordinarily expressive; there it is\r\nnot developed, nor, after some repetitions, heard again; here it is\r\nmade the most of musically and appears so late as in the _Dusk of the\r\nGods_. But the situations are analogous. Senta gazes, rapt, on\r\nVanderdecken; Sieglinda and Siegmund look on one another and passion\r\nbegins to dawn. This is worth noting as showing that Wagner used the\r\nleitmotiv spontaneously, so to speak, and not always as the result of\r\ndeliberate calculation. Like all the other composers, he had his\r\nmannerisms: having invented a melody to find utterance for a feeling\r\nor set of feelings, when similar feelings had to be expressed again it\r\nwas natural to him to use again the first melody, or something very\r\nlike it. No composer, not even Beethoven, was more resolutely bent on\r\nwriting _truthful_ music; and having once found the music to express\r\ncertain shades of feeling, he was like a writer who, having said\r\nsomething as well as he can say it, prefers repeating himself to\r\ntrying to achieve a superficial appearance of variety. Wagner, I\r\nthink, repeated himself quite unconsciously very often: when the\r\nrepetition is conscious of course we have at once the genuine\r\nleitmotiv; but it is the maddest of errors to see in every resemblance\r\nbetween phrases the deliberate employment of the leitmotiv.\r\n\r\nThe pair have drunk mead together and stand looking at one another;\r\nthe storm has died away; and from the orchestra come passages of\r\nwondrous delicacy, tenderness and freshness, scored by a perfect\r\nmaster. Suddenly the clanking of a horse's hoofs is heard; \"Hunding!\"\r\nexclaims Sieglinda; the door is again thrown open and the black,\r\nferocious barbarian stalks in. His theme is, figuratively, as black,\r\ngloomy, sinister and forbidding as himself; and the heavy, sullen\r\ntones of the battery of tubas which announces it intensify its\r\neffectiveness a hundredfold. Hunding is no villain of the piece, but a\r\nsimple, surly chief of a tribe of savage fighters, and Wagner's music\r\nexactly describes him. Save for Siegmund's recital of his woes, the\r\nremainder of the scene remains sullen and gloomy; Siegmund, however,\r\nhas some touching passages, and notably a phrase of unearthly\r\nstrangeness when he tells how he came back to his hut and found his\r\nfather gone, only a wolf-skin lying there; and a bit of the Valhalla\r\nmotive in the orchestra thrills one with its suggestiveness. One is\r\ncarried into the dimmest recess of a forest where man has never been,\r\nfar back in a period so old that it is ridiculous to call it ancient.\r\nThroughout the music is in Wagner's grandest manner; the vocal writing\r\nis perfect; and though there are plenty of theatrical strokes, they\r\nare done in a nobler way than the mere opera way of _Tannhäuser_ and\r\n_Lohengrin_. In a word, the music is big: the breadth and sweep are\r\nenormous: the greatest Wagner has arrived, the Wagner who has gone far\r\nbeyond the hesitations and littlenesses even of the _Rhinegold_.\r\nHunding is characterised more clearly and with more decisive strokes\r\nthan Hagen in the last opera of the _Ring_, partly because there is\r\nmore genuine inspiration in the _Valkyrie_, partly, perhaps, because\r\nHunding is a much simpler personage.\r\n\r\nThat strange scene where Siegmund lies on the hearth again, and,\r\nrealising his desperate situation, calls on his father the Volsung for\r\naid, is musically and dramatically splendid in its colour and force.\r\nAs he thinks of Sieglinda a feeling of spring again comes into the\r\nmusic; thus is strengthened the beautiful music she is given; then\r\ncomes the avowal of love, and the flying open of the door. Outside,\r\nthe trees are seen in the moonlight, the dripping green leaves\r\nglistening; and Siegmund sings a spring-song never to be beaten for\r\nfreshness (though, as I have pointed out, not equal in musical\r\nsignificance to Walther's song in the _Mastersingers_); there comes\r\nthe magnificent scene of the plucking out of the Sword; the\r\nrecognition of the two as brother and sister; and the final\r\nimpassioned outburst which ends the scene as with a blaze of fire.\r\n\r\nThis Act will ever be accounted one of Wagner's most magnificent and\r\nfully inspired. The superb vocal writing, the beauty and sheer\r\nstrength of the orchestral parts, the gorgeous colouring, and the\r\nhuman passion blent with the sense of the green yet fiery spring, all\r\ngo to make up a thing unique in opera. A tide of life rushes through\r\nit all; and the man's technical accomplishment was so fine and\r\ncomplete that he found immediate incisive expression for every shade\r\nof emotion, or complex blend of emotions, and every sensation. The\r\njealous, savage ferocity of Hunding is there; Siegmund's and\r\nSieglinda's despair, hope and final burst of ecstatic joy; and at the\r\nsame time we seem to smell the fresh, wet earth and leaves and to see\r\nthe sparkling moonlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe Second Act opens in a wild and rocky place amongst the mountains.\r\nSiegmund and Sieglinda have fled; Hunding is in hot pursuit; and now\r\nWotan stands, the mighty war-god, brandishing his spear, and calling\r\nhis daughter Brünnhilda, the Valkyrie, to favour and aid Siegmund. She\r\njoyfully assents and goes off, and Wotan exults. He persists in\r\ndeceiving himself: Brünnhilda, his own daughter, was created to\r\nexecute his purposes: the Runes make him accountable for her actions,\r\njust as he is now for Siegmund's and in the later operas for\r\nSiegfried's. As in the _Rhinegold_, Fricka instantly bids him remember\r\nwhat and _how_ he is. As the goddess of covenants, laws, she wants\r\nvengeance wreaked on Siegmund and Sieglinda: they have broken the most\r\nsacred of all covenants in the eyes of a woman, the marriage covenant.\r\nVainly Wotan pleads that the Valkyrie works unaided: she presses him,\r\nuntil at last he swears a sacred oath on his spear that Siegmund shall\r\ndie. Brünnhilda comes in, whooping her war-call, but her voice drops\r\nat the sight of Fricka. Fricka, who thoroughly despises all the\r\nValkyrie maidens as being born out of true wedlock, tells her to take\r\nher orders from Wotan, and goes off triumphant. Wotan, deeply\r\ndespondent, terrifies Brünnhilda with his grief; she casts down her\r\nspear and shield and kneels before him, imploring him to tell the\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nThen follows a scene that is, and always will be, a stumbling-block:\r\nWotan seeks to explain his position in quasi-Schopenhauerian\r\nterminology and at immense length. We know all about it: it has been\r\nexplained amply in the _Rhinegold_ and in the scene we have just\r\nwitnessed, and now he must needs go over the ground again--with dreary\r\nand soporific effect. Brünnhilda, as love incarnate, pleads for the\r\nman and woman whose only crime in her eyes is that they love (for laws\r\nare things pure love cannot understand). Wotan cannot but be obdurate;\r\nhe pronounces sentence on Siegmund and goes off in a storming rage.\r\nSadly Brünnhilda, comprehending nothing of the compulsion Wotan is\r\nsubject to--for how should love know aught of greed for power?--picks\r\nup her weapons (\"How heavy they have grown!\" she says) and prepares to\r\nwarn Siegmund he must die. (No warrior could look upon a Valkyrie save\r\nin the hour of his death; therefore no living being had ever seen\r\none.) As sounds of the approaching steps of panting people are heard\r\nshe retires amongst the rocks; Siegmund and Sieglinda stagger in, the\r\nwoman fainting. She has sinned and is overwhelmed with terror; he\r\ncannot comfort her; she faints, then sleeps--the Valkyrie having\r\nthrown a spell on her. Siegmund bends over her; slowly Brünnhilda\r\nadvances and calls, \"Siegmund! I come to call thee hence\"; he raises\r\nhis head, sees her, and knows his fate. This is the final crushing\r\nblow; the Volsung had always deserted him; but he had found the magic\r\nsword and thought the promised help would not fail him in his worst\r\nneed. (Truly the gods treat us as toys to be broken at pleasure!) He\r\nrefuses to go, and speaks blasphemy of the high gods; Brünnhilda is\r\nhorrified: here she is going to take him to Valhalla to feast on\r\ndelights for ever--and he scorns her. He ridicules Valhalla and Wotan\r\nand the serving-maidens: he wonders who the Valkyrie is, so beautiful\r\nand cold and stern. The scene is one of the fullest dramatic\r\nintensity: at last Siegmund asks whether, if he goes to Valhalla, he\r\nwill find his wife there. \"Siegmund will see Sieglinda no more,\" is\r\nthe answer: Siegmund for the moment is crushed, but again rebels, and\r\ntakes his sword to kill first Sieglinda and then himself. Brünnhilda\r\nis overcome with admiration: _this_, at any rate, this love she can\r\nunderstand; she tells him to prepare to fight Hunding and she will\r\nhelp him.\r\n\r\nThe next scene is unmatched, even in Wagner, for its terror and the\r\nswiftness with which the climax comes on. Clouds gather; Hunding's\r\nhorn is heard and his voice; Siegmund leaves Sieglinda and goes off\r\ncheerfully and confidently to meet his foe. Thicker gather the clouds;\r\nthunder peals and lightnings flash; the antagonists are heard calling\r\nas they seek each other in the darkness; Sieglinda speaks in her\r\ndreams; as she awakes, Hunding and Siegmund are seen in the dim light\r\nhigh up amongst the rocks; Brünnhilda encourages Siegmund, guarding\r\nhim with her spear; he is about to strike Hunding down; there is an\r\nangry red glare, and Wotan shatters the sword with his spear; Hunding\r\nruns his spear through Siegmund; Sieglinda shrieks and falls\r\ninsensible to the ground. Slowly the red light fades; \"Go, tell Fricka\r\nI have sent you,\" Wotan says bitterly, and at his nod Hunding falls\r\ndead; Brünnhilda has run round, picked up the shards of the Sword,\r\nand, gathering Sieglinda in her arms, rushed away. There is a moment\r\nof suspense; the tragedy is accomplished; and now Wotan must punish\r\nBrünnhilda for disobeying his commands; and amidst thunders and\r\nlightnings, in flaming wrath, he rides off, and the curtain falls.\r\n\r\nThe drama of Siegmund and Sieglinda is ended; the second inner drama,\r\nthat of Wotan and Brünnhilda, is begun. Love, the best part of Wotan's\r\nnature, has risen against him in his endeavour to rule; she cannot\r\nprevent him destroying the creatures he has made, but she can defy\r\nhim. That sort of rule would be intolerable, so love shall be put away\r\nfrom him and he will still rule. And, love being discarded, there is\r\nno reason why he should not still get the Ring, by fair or foul means,\r\nand reign--loveless indeed, but in no fear of Fafner or the Nibelung,\r\nblack Alberich.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAs a musical structure the Second Act divides more easily and clearly\r\nthan the first into sections: the sections, indeed, are boldly\r\ndefined. First there is a prelude formed of the scene in which Wotan,\r\nrejoicing in the coming combat, directs Brünnhilda to see to it that\r\nHunding is slain; and this is followed by what may be regarded as the\r\nmain first movement--the dispute between Wotan and Fricka, terminating\r\nin his taking the oath; then comes his monologue, addressed, of\r\ncourse, to Brünnhilda (\"In talking to thee it is with myself I seem to\r\nspeak,\" to transcribe approximately what he says); Brünnhilda's\r\nwarning to Siegmund follows, and then the finale, the catastrophic\r\nclimax with Siegmund's death.\r\n\r\nThe prelude opens with the same fiery impetuosity as that to the First\r\nAct. It is largely made up of what in the guide-books used to be\r\ncalled the \"Flight motive\"--as though a serious composer would or\r\ncould invent a motive of Running away!--and as the opening bar may be\r\ntaken as a variation of the Sword theme, and the thing ends with what\r\nwe learn to be a tune associated with the Valkyries, a really fertile\r\nand picturesque mind may see in it a musical account of Siegmund\r\nflying with the Sword and pursued, for good or evil, by the Valkyrie.\r\nWhat we really feel in it is the harshness of the opening discords,\r\nthe agitation, the power, all forming a fitting prelude to what we see\r\nwhen the curtain rises, the barren rocks, and Wotan, exultant, calling\r\nBrünnhilda. His phrases have, indeed, a glorious vigour, as have\r\nBrünnhilda's in her answer. Her war-whoop plays an important part in\r\nthe Third Act. Fricka's music is royally imperious at first: such\r\ndeclamation had never been thought of in the world before; but there\r\nis rare beauty of an austere kind--the beauty of holiness--afterwards,\r\nas she momentarily drops her dignity and pleads her cause. She gains\r\nthe day and departs, and after Wotan's tedious meditation comes the\r\nmost magnificent music of all. We hear the Fate theme--a strange\r\nphrase that seems to question destiny without ever getting an\r\nanswer--and a subject taken bodily from Mendelssohn and made into a\r\nnew thing filled with a curious blending of wistful and tender pity,\r\nmystery and power. It gives us a glimpse into the very heart of\r\nBrünnhilda, obeying her father because she must, and revolting against\r\nthe task. Siegmund's declamation is a fine example of Wagner's finest\r\nvocal writing at this period--the style which I have referred to as\r\nsomething between recitative and true song. That is, it remains\r\nmetrical without the slightest tendency to fall into regular four-bar\r\nmeasure, or any other regular measure; yet it decidedly is not\r\nrecitative. But as the prevailing mood becomes more exalted, so does\r\nthe music become more lyrical, and the ending of the dialogue, when\r\nBrünnhilda's emotion swamps every other consideration than rescuing\r\nthe lovers, is sheer song. The orchestral part is symphonic\r\nthroughout, with a few dramatic pauses. One of the most wonderful of\r\nthese is at Brünnhilda's reply: \"Siegmund will see Sieglinda no more.\"\r\nThere is no wailing, no sadness, in the accompaniment--only simple\r\nchords; and the simple voice-phrase, evidently intended to be\r\nhalf-spoken, makes an effect of overwhelming pathos. Of a different\r\norder is Siegmund's refusal to go to Valhalla: it verges on the\r\nmelodramatic, and the emotion expressed justifies the means. It may be\r\nremarked that though the instrumental writing is symphonic, there is\r\nnone of the contrapuntal intricacy of _Tristan_: the pictorial\r\nrequirement warranted a freer use of chords in the accompanying parts,\r\nboth--if a paradoxical phrase may be pardoned--for the abstract colour\r\nof the chords and for the instrumental tone colour which the use of\r\nchords permitted. Wagner never ceases to make us feel that the drama\r\npasses amidst the wild mountains and woods: the drama is poignant\r\nenough in all conscience, and the scenery is an aid to it. We have the\r\npurely pictorial Wagner with the gathering storm--the voices calling\r\namongst the clouds. The sinister growling of the approaching thunder\r\nis heard, and, still more sinister, the harsh notes of Hunding's\r\nhorn; the orchestra rages louder and louder, Sieglinda mutters in her\r\ndream, the Valkyrie's call is heard encouraging Siegmund, the crash as\r\nthe Sword is splintered, and then an awful silence. The action has\r\nbeen long delayed, but the catastrophe arrives with appalling\r\nswiftness at the end, and the music is equal to the opportunity. It is\r\nnot wholly theatre music: that passage in the bass, galloping up and\r\ndown the scale against a _tremolando_ accompaniment, is in itself fine\r\nmusic; even Hunding's rough cow-horn makes a musical effect. When\r\nWotan's fury breaks forth and he rides off in godlike wrath--even here\r\nthe music is glorious, taken simply as music. Had all the _Ring_ been\r\ndone with the superb mastery of this and the preceding Act, we should\r\nhave an art creation to be set above every other art achievement in\r\nthe world--above anything done by Æschylus, Sophocles and Shakespeare.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nLike the First Act, the Third begins with a storm of rain, wind,\r\nthunder and lightning; like First and Second, it opens with a display\r\nof energy before which all listeners are as leaves in the wind. As\r\npanoramic displays translated into music all the three introductions\r\nare likely enough to be misunderstood; so at the outset let us\r\ncarefully bear in mind Wagner's intention at the beginning of the last\r\nAct of the _Valkyrie_--to show, with unequalled force and splendour,\r\nthe strength of the god, soon to be shown as nothing before the\r\nstrength of Brünnhilda. Brünnhilda, let us always remember, stands for\r\nhuman love, affection--not love in the _Tristan_ sense--but that love\r\nof which Goldsmith sang that He \"loved us into being\"; the love of\r\nhuman being for human being so strong that not for so many thousands a\r\nyear as a judge, so many pitiable hundreds a year as a magistrate,\r\nimmortality as an omnipotent ruler or a Wotan, will it perpetuate or\r\npermit a wrong on a human being. To win omnipotence Wotan has\r\ninflicted wrong upon wrong--wrong upon wrong on those he had created\r\nfor his purpose, on those the fine part of his nature loved. The fine\r\npart of his nature revolts and conquers him. He struggles on, shorn of\r\nnine-tenths of his strength, and it is not until the Third Act of\r\n_Siegfried_ that he sees himself beaten and acknowledges it; but the\r\nending of the gods, which really began with Wotan's first grasp at\r\nuniversal power, is first in this last Act of the _Valkyrie_ clearly\r\nforetold. Wotan comes on clothed in thunders and lightnings to punish\r\nBrünnhilda because she fought on the side of the higher instead of the\r\nlower part of his nature--his higher self is cast from him, only (he\r\nthinks) to unite later with a force (a hero) independent of him to\r\ngain him his sovereignty.\r\n\r\nThe tempest rages and roars; the Valkyries arrive \"by ones, by twos,\r\nby threes,\" at the Valkyries' Rock; and presently, in hotter haste\r\nthan the rest, Brünnhilda comes in, bringing Sieglinda. She tells her\r\n(Brünnhilda's) sisters how she has defied Wotan, the All-father; they\r\nare scandalised, and desert her; Sieglinda feebly begs her to take no\r\nmore trouble--there is nothing left to live for; Brünnhilda tells her\r\nshe carries within her the seed of the highest hero of all the world;\r\nSieglinda is filled with joy, revives, and flies to the cave in the\r\nwood where Siegfried is destined to be born. Wotan comes on with his\r\nthunders and lightnings and calls for Brünnhilda; at last she answers,\r\nand he announces her punishment: she shall be deprived of her godhood\r\nand left on the mountains to become the wife and slave of the first\r\nman that passes. The other maidens wail in protest; in anger he bids\r\nthem begone; Brünnhilda, overcome with shame, sinks at his feet. The\r\nstorm slowly dies away; Brünnhilda rises and pleads her cause--\"Is\r\nthis crime of mine so shameful?--in protecting Siegmund the Volsung I\r\nsimply followed what I knew to be the dictates of your own innermost\r\nheart.\" At first Wotan will scarcely hear her; gradually he relents.\r\nBut he cannot go back on his oath, on the sentence he has pronounced;\r\nand in the end he yields her this much--that she shall lie guarded by\r\na wall of fire, only to be claimed by a hero who, not fearing his\r\nspear, will pass through the fire. Then he bids her an everlasting\r\nfarewell; lays her to sleep in her armour, covered by her shield, her\r\nweapon by her side; calls up the fire, and casting a last sad look on\r\nher, his favourite child, goes slowly off as the curtain falls.\r\n\r\nThe drama here is of the most poignant kind; the scenic surroundings\r\nare of the sort Wagner so greatly loved--tempest amidst black\r\npine-woods, with wild, flying clouds, the dying down of the storm,\r\nthe saffron evening light melting into shadowy night, the calm\r\ndeep-blue sky with the stars peeping out, then the bright flames\r\nshooting up; and the two elements, the dramatic and the pictorial,\r\ndrew out of him some pages as splendid as any even he ever wrote. The\r\nopening, \"the Ride of the Valkyries,\" is a piece of storm-music\r\nwithout a parallel. There is no need here for Donner with his hammer:\r\nthe All-father himself is abroad in wrath and majesty, and his\r\ndaughters laugh and rejoice in the riot. There is nothing uncanny in\r\nthe music: we have that delight in the sheer force of the elements\r\nwhich we inherit from our earliest ancestors: the joy of nature\r\nfiercely at work which is echoed in our hearts from time immemorial.\r\nThe shrilling of the wind, the hubbub, the calls of the Valkyries to\r\none another, the galloping of the horses, form a picture which for\r\nsplendour, wild energy and wilder beauty can never be matched.\r\n\r\nTechnically, this Ride is a miracle built up of many of the\r\nconventional figurations of the older music. There is the continuous\r\nshake, handed on from instrument to instrument, the slashing figure of\r\nthe upper strings, the kind of basso ostinato, conventionally\r\nindicating the galloping of horses, and the chief melody, a mere\r\nbugle-call, altered by a change of rhythm into a thing of superb\r\nstrength. The only part of the music that ever so remotely suggests\r\nextravagance is the Valkyrie's call; and it, after all, is only a\r\njodel put to sublime uses. Out of these commonplace elements, elements\r\nthat one might almost call prosaic, Wagner wrought his picture of\r\nstorm, with its terror, power, joyous laughter of the storm's\r\ndaughters--storm as it must have seemed to the first poets of our\r\nrace. The counterpoint is not so obviously wonderful as in _Tristan_\r\nand the _Mastersingers_, but only a contrapuntist equal to Bach and\r\nHandel could have written such counterpoint. We may gain a clearer\r\nidea of what this means if we compare, not to the disadvantage of one\r\nor the other, this Ride with Berlioz's \"Ride to the Abyss.\" At first\r\nsight, Berlioz seems the more daring. He trusts to a persistent rhythm\r\nand to orchestral effects. There is no inner structure--the separate\r\nparts, or batteries of parts, have no individuality: nothing of the\r\nsort is attempted or indeed wanted. The horses gallop on like mad\r\nthings: their pace cannot be checked; themes, properly speaking, there\r\nare none--we hear the screeches of fearsome wild-fowl, the excitement\r\nand the noise increase, until at last the catastrophe is reached, and\r\nthe final climax is the terrible gibberish-chant of all the devils in\r\nhell. Regarded as sheer music, the thing gets as far by the twentieth\r\nbar as ever it gets. The piece is as near to pure colour in music as\r\ncan be attained. Why, Wagner with his counterpoint seems old-fashioned\r\nand formal by comparison! The four constituents, the wild laughter of\r\nthe shakes of the wood-wind, the slashing figure of the strings, the\r\ngalloping figure of the bass, the Ride theme--had these been used by\r\nany one save Wagner the result would have been unendurably wooden. But\r\nWagner had unlimited harmonic resources at his disposal; and he had\r\nthe determination and the gift to achieve perfect truth in his\r\ndelineation of a storm. Delineation, I say, for here we have drawing\r\nas well as colour. Of colour there is plenty: notice, for example, the\r\nuse of the brass against the descending chromatics; but the colour is\r\nmainly harmonic. In a sense Wagner was not an innovator: so long as\r\nthe methods of his mighty predecessors served him he sought no\r\nothers--effects, whether of orchestration or of melody, were to him\r\nsimply means: never for a second was he beguiled into regarding them\r\nas ends; and every musician knows that plenty of them came at his\r\ncall, more readily and spontaneously than in the case of any of the\r\nlater musicians.\r\n\r\nIt is worth looking at the plan of this Ride--which is, be it\r\nremembered, only the prelude to the gigantic drama which is to follow.\r\nAfter the ritornello the main theme is announced, with a long break\r\nbetween the first and second strains; and again a break before it is\r\ncontinued. Then it sounds out in all its glory, terse, closely gripped\r\nsection to section, until the Valkyries' call is heard; purely\r\npictorial passages follow; the theme is played with, even as Mozart\r\nand Beethoven played with their themes, and at the last the whole\r\nforce of the orchestra is employed, and his object is attained--he has\r\ngiven us a picture of storm such as was never done before, and he has\r\ndone what was necessary for the subsequent drama--made us feel the\r\ntremendous might of the god of storms. A few of my readers may know\r\nHandel's \"Horse and his Rider\" chorus--how he piles mass on mass of\r\ntone until in the end we seem to see a whole irresistible sea rushing\r\nover Pharaoh and his host. Wagner does a thing perfectly analogous;\r\nbut as I have remarked with regard to Weber and Mendelssohn and their\r\npicturesque music, where Handel, having painted his tremendous\r\npicture, had achieved his end and was satisfied and left off, is just\r\nthe point where Wagner begins what to him is much the more important\r\nthing, the drama. The omnipotent master of Valhalla comes on apace:\r\nthe storm is a mere indication of what is coming.\r\n\r\nA word must be said, too, about the words for such scenes as this.\r\nWords had to be found, as in the first song of the Rhinemaidens, and\r\nit is hard to see what else Wagner could have done than what he has\r\ndone. Like reversed Lohengrins they tell one another their name and\r\nstation at great length. This may be a vestige of the older\r\nstage-craft: certainly there is none of it in the two great dramas\r\nthat followed the _Valkyrie_. It is not for even the minor personages\r\nof a Wagner drama to come down to the footlights and take the audience\r\ninto their confidence. But, as I say, words were indispensable, and\r\nWagner found the best he could--I suppose. The defect is a tiny one;\r\nnone the less it is a defect.\r\n\r\nWith the final crash of the Ride a new element is introduced. The\r\ngodlike rejoicing in sheer strength disappears, and an agitated theme\r\nsounds out--if, indeed, we may call it a theme--and then we get a lull\r\nafter all the hurly-burly. Brünnhilda and Sieglinda come in;\r\nBrünnhilda tells of her disobedience, and like a flock of wild-fowl\r\ndisturbed the other Valkyries squeak and gibber in disgust and\r\nhorror. The music here is perhaps the most operatic part of the\r\nopera--Brünnhilda begging first one and then another to aid her; one\r\nafter another refusing in very conventional phrases. The scene is\r\nindispensable, and the music is, so to speak, coldly adequate: music\r\nhas no tones to express primness. With the voice of Sieglinda the\r\nmusic at once begins to live in Wagner's own curious fashion. She has\r\nnothing left in life, wishes to cause sorrow to no one, wishes only to\r\nbe left alone to die. Wagner well knew when the drama could make its\r\neffect almost unaided--when, in fact, to write deliberately pathetic\r\nmusic in the older style would be to overdo things. Sieglinda's\r\nphrases are simple, many of them exquisite, most of them designed to\r\nbe sung parlando, rather spoken than really sung. Bathos is avoided:\r\nthe deepest depths of genuine pathos are touched. In fact the\r\ntechnique of the scene is that of parts, only parts, of the previous\r\nact. But with Brünnhilda's announcement to Sieglinda we get the great\r\nlyrical Wagner, we get the germ of the magnificent harangue of the\r\nlast act of the _Dusk of the Gods_, and we get the mightiest of the\r\nSiegfried themes. With the entrance of Wotan the music which concludes\r\nthe Second Act recurs: the All-powerful clothed in wrath and flame;\r\nthen comes his denunciation of Brünnhilda, another specimen of the\r\nlyrical Wagner. Even more characteristic of Wagner is the dying down\r\nof the storm. We can _see_ the setting sun and the departing\r\nstorm-clouds in the music, and with these we are made to feel the\r\nabating wrath of the god. And then comes the noblest piece of\r\nrecitative in all music. The words in which Brünnhilda appeals to her\r\nfather have already been (roughly) quoted: to give an idea of the\r\nmusical phrases would require too many pages of this book. The Sleep\r\ntheme enters as Wotan sees a way to the great compromise--the\r\ncompromise foredoomed to bring him to ruin. He will put Brünnhilda to\r\nsleep to await the hero; but he will hedge her in with fire so that\r\nthe hero shall be a true one. With the indescribable finesse,\r\nsubtlety, of his own particular art, Wagner lets us feel how\r\nBrünnhilda, in begging to be protected in this (rather unusual) way,\r\nis reading only her own father's thought: he seems for a long time to\r\ncontend, but at last yields. The music steadily increases in force and\r\npassion, and at each stage where one would think the composer could\r\nstrike no harder he immediately does it. More and more of the divine\r\nfury pours into the music, until the climax is reached in the bars\r\npreceding the Farewell.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime we have had the wonderful Eternal Love theme--not\r\nsexual love, but the mystic force that created the worlds and holds\r\nthem in their courses: in all Wagner there is no nobler and sweeter\r\npassage than that in which Brünnhilda first sings it. The vivid\r\nmusical description of the crackling flames which are to surround her\r\nis another of an unequalled series of marvels. The Farewell I have\r\nalready compared with that at the end of _Lohengrin_: the voice part\r\nis at times in Wagner's own style of song-recitative, but a great deal\r\nof it is sheer simple melody. No master has excelled, or perhaps\r\nmatched, Wagner in the art of expressing the most profound and\r\npoignant pathos without ever a suspicion of letting it lapse into\r\nbathos; and this he does by--what at first it may seem ridiculous to\r\nsay of so opulent and luxurious a genius as Wagner's--by his\r\ninstinctive artistic austerity. The word is not too strong to be\r\napplied to the resolute simplicity which enabled him to write such\r\nmelodies as those of which I am now speaking and the Farewell in\r\n_Lohengrin_: the temptation to let himself go, to wallow in sadness\r\nand to wring our bowels must have been almost too tremendous to be\r\nresisted by the man who within a year or so planned _Tristan_. In art,\r\nharrowing our feelings never pays, and his self-repression has its\r\nexceeding great reward: we could not feel more with Wotan's desolating\r\ngrief--one stroke more and we should rebel: we should know that our\r\nmost sacred feelings were being exploited--that an endeavour was being\r\nmade to gain our applause for a work of art by an illegitimate appeal\r\nat one particular moment to those feelings. I have dwelt a little on\r\nthis because we all know _Tristan_ and its author, and though there is\r\nlittle self-repression in that work--where it is not required--and\r\nphysically there was little but self-indulgence in its author's\r\nnature, it is well to realise that the artist rose immeasurably\r\nsuperior to the man. It must have come to us all at one time or\r\nanother with something of a shock to find that the voluptuous Wagner\r\nof _Tannhäuser_ could be as austere as Milton. Austerity is not\r\nbarrenness--not the barrenness that would result from imitating the\r\nausterity of the old church composers with their hundred rules and\r\nregulations: the harmony is as free as could be wished; at the needful\r\nmoment the melodies pass without hesitation from key to key; but when\r\nwe have long known them and learnt to understand them we find them at\r\nheart to be idealised folk-tunes--simple and indescribably pathetic,\r\nas the situation demands.\r\n\r\nAn instance of Wagner's subtle feeling is the passage where Wotan\r\n\"kisses away\" Brünnhilda's godhood and lays her to sleep, as one with\r\nthe rocks and stones of mother earth, Erda, whose music accompanies\r\nthe act. Wotan, like Alberich, has renounced love; so just previously\r\nwe have heard the corresponding passage from the _Rhinegold_. We have\r\nthe lulling Sleep theme, and then comes the Fire-music, a thing\r\nunmatched--and, so far as I know, never attempted--in all music. The\r\nmighty Spear strikes the ground to the mighty Spear theme; the earth\r\nseems to shiver as the fire comes up; then the flames mount, yellow\r\nagainst the deep blue sky; the Loge music sparkles in the orchestra,\r\nthe strings sustain a continuous whizz and roar, and over it all, and\r\nat times in it or under it, swings that lulling Sleep theme. If it is\r\nnot too futile a word to use, the Siegfried \"heroic\" theme, as Wotan\r\nuses it in commanding the fire (Loge) that only the noblest hero ever\r\nborn shall pass to Brünnhilda, is the most pompous form in which it\r\nappears throughout the _Ring_; but the situation warrants it, demands\r\nit. Amidst the roar of the fire and with the divine lulling phrase,\r\nfragments of the Farewell are heard; and twice, as Wotan looks back on\r\nhis daughter, we hear the Fate theme--the Scandinavian sense that this\r\ntragedy _mysteriously had to be_: the mighty god and lord of the\r\nuniverse himself knows and feels that the things preordained must\r\nhappen. He goes slowly off; the central tragedy is virtually\r\naccomplished; to the end the fire blazes and sparkles, and the curtain\r\ndescends on a soft chord. The revolving seasons will pass; strange\r\nevents will happen in the outer world of men; Brünnhilda will sleep\r\nthere, the guarding fire seen from afar by awe-stricken warrior\r\ntribes.\r\n\r\nThe spring freshness of the music, its vivid pictorial quality, the\r\nintense human feeling expressed, its profound sense of the past and\r\nthe mystery of things, the godlike power, place it hardly second, if\r\nindeed second, to _Tristan_. There are love-duets in music which may\r\nbe compared with those in _Tristan_: there is nothing with which the\r\nmusic of the _Valkyrie_ may be compared. The grandeur of Handel's\r\npicture-painting in _Israel in Egypt_ is a different quality\r\naltogether. Handel is unapproachable; but he worked with a different\r\naim, in a different way, and in a different material. Wagner's music\r\nis beautiful and sublime, and he blent the human element with the\r\nothers in a fashion no other musician has attempted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n'SIEGFRIED'\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Liszt Wagner says he would not have undertaken the toil\r\nof completing so gigantic a work as the _Ring_ but for his love of\r\nSiegfried, his ideal of manhood. It is as well, from one point of\r\nview, that his love of his ideal was so intense, for in consequence we\r\nhave the _Ring_; but from another point of view it is not so well, for\r\nthe youth Siegfried is the least lovable, perhaps the most inane and\r\ndetestable character to be found in any form of drama. He is a\r\ncombination of impudence, stupidity and sheer animal strength--mere\r\nbone and sinew; his courage comes from his stupidity. The courage and\r\nstrength and impudence carry him through to his one victory; then his\r\nstupidity leads him straight to destruction. He possesses not one fine\r\ntrait: he is as weak in will and intellect as he is strong in muscle.\r\nIn the 'fifties and 'sixties not only Germans but men of all other\r\nnationalities seem to have vainly imagined they had solved all the\r\nproblems of this very difficult world by assuming and proclaiming that\r\nmight is right. Bismarck acted on this belief; our own Carlyle,\r\nTennyson and Ruskin preached it; and Wagner, being a feeble creature\r\nphysically, fell naturally, inevitably, a victim to the old delusion,\r\nand set to work to glorify the strong man. There is a further\r\nexplanation. I need not do more than refer to an idea which took\r\ndefinite form during the eighteenth century, that as many of the\r\ndefects and problems of modern life spring from the very conditions\r\nunder which our civilisation alone is possible, a return to a state of\r\nnature, without government, clothes, or even houses to live in, would\r\nbe a return to the garden of Eden before the Fall. We see this notion\r\nworking in Wagner's mind continually in the prose writings, and in his\r\nlast opera we see Parsifal, the \"pure fool,\" \"redeeming\" an\r\nover-civilised world. To glorify the idiot absolute in this fashion\r\nwas to out-Rousseau Rousseau--though Wagner would have scorned the\r\nsuggestion. In _Siegfried_ he goes by no means so far; but he goes\r\nquite far enough. Siegfried is no idiot; but he certainly is an\r\nunamiable, truculent savage. He has been reared by a dwarf and\r\ncripple, Mime, and the first we see of him is on his entry with a wild\r\nbear in leash, which beast he drives at his terrified foster-father.\r\nThe justification is that he feels instinctively that Mime is bad, low\r\nand cunning--and it does not justify him: Mime, with an ulterior\r\npurpose, it is true, has saved him from death by starvation in his\r\ninfancy, and nurtured him, and the least Siegfried could do was to\r\nleave the abject creature in peace. It is true also that he is mending\r\nSiegfried's sword--but this is to anticipate. I cannot accept\r\nSiegfried as a specimen of the highest heroic humanity. The boldness\r\nof a man who because of his dull wits cannot realise danger is of no\r\nuse in this world under any imaginable conditions. Siegfried knows no\r\nfear. There is a story of two officers conversing during a battle. One\r\nasked, \"Are you afraid?\" Reply: \"If you were as afraid as I am you\r\nwould run away.\" One, the tale assumes, had a finely organised brain,\r\nthe other brute force and insensibility. Which is the nearer approach\r\nto an ideal of noble manhood? Wagner's _Siegfried_ answers, brute\r\nferocity. Judged by his own standard how would Wagner himself\r\nstand?--as splendidly organised a brain as that possessed by any man\r\nborn into the nineteenth or any other century?\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe continuous clink-clink-clink of a metalworker's hammer is heard;\r\nthe curtain rises, and we first see through an opening at the back of\r\nthe stage the bright green shining forest; as our eyes grow accustomed\r\nto the darkness in the front we gradually perceive a rude smithy in a\r\ncave, with an anvil, a forge with a smouldering fire, and a deformed\r\ndwarf, Mime, at work trying to piece together the shards of the broken\r\nsword. That sword was Siegmund's, shattered by a blow of Wotan's\r\nspear; and long ago it was to this cave Sieglinda fled, bearing with\r\nher the fragments. Siegmund and Sieglinda are long dead, Sieglinda\r\nafter giving birth to Siegfried; not far off is Hate-cave, where the\r\ndragon Fafner lies guarding his precious gold amongst it the Ring;\r\nfar away Brünnhilda sleeps on the mountain, surrounded by her wall of\r\nfire. There she lay on the evening of Siegmund's death; there she has\r\nlain since. The world has gone on its way; Siegmund and Sieglinda have\r\ndeparted; Siegfried has grown to manhood; year by year the young\r\nshoots in the forest have sprouted and the leaves spread to the\r\nsunlight: as we see the forest now, so was it on that fateful day, and\r\nso it has been as the successive summers came. Siegmund lived, died,\r\nand his memory has almost perished; save to the dwarf, the very name\r\nof Sieglinda is unknown; other men have lived and died: nature only\r\ngoes on her course, the trees each year bringing forth fresh leaves to\r\nrepair last year's losses, as though the lives and deaths of brave men\r\nand women were nothing to her. The earth is sweet and pleasant, but\r\nnature must attend to her own affairs, and her indifference to the\r\naffairs of men, her unchangeableness amidst all the vicissitudes of\r\nmen's lives, compel us to realise in such a scene as this at once her\r\nown eternal youthfulness and man's brief, ephemeral existence. At one\r\nstroke Wagner creates the atmosphere for his drama, and gives us as no\r\nother artist has ever given it a sense of the unfathomable mystery of\r\nthe world and of life.\r\n\r\nThe dwarf taps away with his hammer; he longs to patch up the sword\r\nthat Siegfried may kill the dragon and he, Mime, get the hoard; he\r\nbewails his weakness, but he does his best. All his labour proves\r\nuseless--the sword refuses to be mended; and in comes Siegfried with\r\nhis bear. The bear is driven off into the woods; there is a long\r\naltercation and an explanation; Siegfried cannot believe that, as he\r\nhas been told, Mime is his father, and he learns the truth. He softens\r\ninto something approaching manhood as he hears of his mother's death;\r\nand finally rushes off into the forest, leaving Mime again to his\r\ntask. Then follows a scene to be accounted for in only one way. First,\r\nthe scene: Mime sits in despair, and there enters an old man with his\r\nslouch-hat drawn down over one eye, wearing a dark blue cloak (it\r\nought to be dotted with stars), and carrying a spear or staff in his\r\nhands. He gains the sacred hearth, converses with Mime, and finally\r\nbets him his head that he cannot answer three questions. Much to my\r\nsurprise when I first saw the score of _Siegfried_, these form merely\r\nan excuse for going again over the ground covered in the _Rhinegold_\r\nand the _Valkyrie_. The Scandinavian hegemony is expounded, and other\r\nmatters are gracefully touched on; the only point is made when the\r\nlast question is propounded and Mime cannot answer: Who is it shall\r\nforge the sword, slay Fafner, take the hoard, pass through the fire\r\nand take Brünnhilda for his wife? The old man laughs, leaves Mime his\r\nhead, but tells him it will fall to the hero who can do all these\r\nthings, the hero who knows not fear. He goes off; thunder is heard;\r\nstrange lights flicker amongst the trees; and Mime falls into an\r\necstasy of terror, suffering all the agonies of a waking nightmare,\r\nuntil the spell is abruptly broken by the entry of Siegfried. Why we\r\nshould have the two previous dramas of the _Ring_ told again in this\r\nway is the puzzle. In the letter to Uhlig (p. 227) Wagner had plainly\r\ngiven his reasons for writing the _Rhinegold_ and the _Valkyrie_--to\r\nset before the audience clearly and vividly the events leading up to\r\n_Siegfried's Death_, in action, not in narrative. We have seen them in\r\naction, and lo! we get them in narrative! Wagner's idea must have been\r\nto show us Wotan, realising how matters had passed beyond his control,\r\ngoing about the world as the Wanderer, watching the development of\r\nthings and awaiting the inevitable day. He gives us the very awe and\r\nthrill of our Scandinavian forbears with the apparition of the\r\ngrey-bearded man in his cloak coloured like deep night--the terrible\r\ngod that they believed walked the earth and might enter their\r\nhomesteads at any moment. Of course, as we shall see presently, the\r\nanswer to the third question prepares the next stage of the drama. But\r\nas to why the whole story of the _Ring_ should be repeated--well, even\r\ngods must have something to talk about if they wish to talk at all;\r\nand the scene serves to sustain and to intensify the atmosphere in\r\nwhich the whole drama is enacted, the atmosphere of the old sagas. But\r\nI cheerfully concede that it is far too long, and in many respects an\r\nartistic error.\r\n\r\nThe real drama of _Siegfried_, considering it as a separate,\r\nself-contained opera, is now prepared for, and forthwith begins. We\r\nknow Siegfried and the task before him; we know Mime and _his_\r\ntask--to find out if Siegfried can be made to fear, and if he cannot,\r\nto encourage him to kill the dragon, win the gold, and then to poison\r\nhim. He tries Siegfried with stories of terror, asks him if he has\r\nnever felt afraid of this, that and the other; and finding that this\r\nis the veritable Hero, makes his preparation. Siegfried takes the\r\nsplinters of the sword--the splinters no smith can weld\r\ntogether--files them to dust, melts the dust, re-casts the sword and\r\nfinishes it. Meantime Mime, working on, brews his poisonous broth,\r\nmuttering to himself about his purpose. At the end Siegfried tests the\r\nsword and proves it true by splitting the anvil. All sorts of\r\nallegorical meanings may be found in this gigantic scene; but the\r\nplain meaning is that to a hero, unique, unparalleled in the history\r\nof the world, a patched-up weapon, used previously by lesser men, is\r\nuseless: his sword must be new, and only he himself can forge it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nBefore dealing further with the drama of _Siegfried_ I wish, for a\r\nreason, to say a few words about the music of this First Act. From\r\n_Tannhäuser_ onward Wagner showed in the music of his operas a\r\ncomplete mastery of what can only be called the business-artistic side\r\nof his art, or perhaps a complete knowledge of effectiveness. In so\r\nlong an affair as an opera, and especially a Wagner opera,\r\neffectiveness depends largely on contrast, not simply between scene\r\nand scene of an act, but also in a more marked degree between act and\r\nact of an opera. In the _Dutchman_ there is none of this larger\r\ncontrast, and could hardly be, for the _Dutchman_ was originally\r\nplanned as an opera in one act. There is contrast enough, but he\r\ncontrasts set-piece with set-piece, scene with scene, not act with\r\nact. In _Tannhäuser_ he works on the bigger scale and contrasts act\r\nwith act: the opening of the Second reveals a totally different mood\r\nfrom that of the First, and the Third is entirely different from\r\neither. This is true of the _Valkyrie_; but the _Rhinegold_, like the\r\n_Dutchman_, is all of a piece, and is, moreover, the prelude to a huge\r\ndrama. When we come to _Siegfried_ we see at once how he was planning\r\nhis music on a still vaster scale: the atmosphere of _Siegfried_ is in\r\ncontrast, almost violent contrast, with that of the _Valkyrie_. The\r\nmusic of the last act of the _Valkyrie_ is of a different character\r\naltogether from that of the beginning of _Siegfried_. This is not\r\nmerely due to the development of Wagner's genius and his technical\r\npower, but can be shown to be deliberately planned. Indeed, it ought\r\nnot to need any demonstration, knowing as we do know his knowledge and\r\ngrip of what is effective in the theatre. It would be absurd to\r\nsuppose that he was not perfectly well aware that every one would yawn\r\nif after hearing the _Valkyrie_ his audience found _Siegfried_ to be\r\nsimply a continuation of the _Valkyrie_, found the two operas to be\r\nvirtually the same work with the scissors put through the score at an\r\narbitrarily chosen point. Consider the scenery of the two operas:\r\nFirst Act of the _Valkyrie_, Hunding's hut with the smouldering fire;\r\nSecond, a rocky defile in the mountains and no particular weather;\r\nThird, storm round the Valkyries' rock, black flying clouds, the pines\r\ntossing their branches to the tempest, and, at the end, a peaceful\r\nevening sky and then the yellow flames shooting up against it. We must\r\nnote the change to the beginning of _Siegfried_: a dark cave, and\r\noutside it the forest, green, fresh and bright; Second Act, the\r\nentrance to Hate-cave, time, night, long before dawn, and at the end a\r\nsummer morning, with the sun shimmering on the grass and the trees\r\ngently murmuring in the wind; Third, a rocky ravine in the early\r\nmorning, grey storm-clouds scudding past, the wind whistling; at the\r\nend, a mountain top, Brünnhilda sleeping, the peaceful trees, a horse\r\nquietly grazing, morning sunlight. This sequence shows how carefully\r\nthe matter was schemed; and we may now turn to the music.\r\n\r\nWhen the same leitmotivs are largely employed throughout a long\r\noperatic work there must be a superficial, or, if I may say so,\r\nexternal, monotony in the character of the music. A first glance at\r\nthe scores reveals to the eye the same series of notes and chords\r\nrepeated again and again; to any but the most attentive listener a\r\nfirst hearing leaves the impression of the same themes and passages\r\nendlessly repeated. But any one who leaves the theatre on an evening\r\nafter the _Valkyrie_ bearing with him a vivid memory of the brilliance\r\nand sweetness of the close must at the very least be struck by the\r\nsombre colouring of the opening of _Siegfried_ the following evening.\r\nI do not mean the orchestral colouring, but the intrinsic thing, the\r\nmusic itself. The tapping of the hammer on steel goes on, and in mock\r\nseriousness the orchestra gives out a series of prolonged sighs or\r\ngroans of the most lugubrious character, reaching a climax as poor\r\nmiserable Mime at last gives up his job in despair. Mime, we must\r\nremember, is a half-comic personage; and were his music allotted to\r\nsome heroic man facing an impossible task it would be much the same,\r\nsave that Wagner would not have so exaggerated the hysterical emotion.\r\nTo depict a being facing an impossible task with no noble, but with\r\nonly an ignoble, motive requires such an exaggerated mode of\r\nexpression. Mime's grief is real enough, but the cause of it\r\ncontemptible. After a considerable deal in this mournful key comes the\r\nsudden entry of the bright young savage Siegfried, driving the bear.\r\nHis first theme is simply a bugle hunting call: Siegfried was then\r\nnothing but a hunter, a wild child of the forest. But as he gets on\r\nwith what he has to say Wagner warms up to his work, and we get many\r\ninspired pages, some of them showing the tendency to indulge in\r\ncounterpoint of the finest sort which manifested itself more fully in\r\nthe _Mastersingers_, though here the movement is fuller of rude\r\nimpetuosity. The movement--for it is a distinct movement--in which\r\nSiegfried describes how he had often looked into the smooth-running\r\nbrook, and seeing his reflection there knew he did not resemble Mime,\r\nwho therefore could not be his father--for the cub is like the\r\nbear--is one of Wagner's loveliest, and full of a delicate pastoral\r\nfeeling (again, in contrast with everything in the _Valkyrie_). The\r\nWanderer music is sublime. The theme was borrowed from Liszt, and\r\nLiszt ought to have been grateful, for the possibilities of his own\r\nmusical subject were surely unfolded to him for the first time. In the\r\nmusic here, even more than in the vision of the stage, we have the\r\ngrey Wanderer of the Scandinavian imagination--the mystery of wood,\r\nmountain, river and ravine, with human sadness superadded, is clearly\r\ncommunicated to us. Passing over the repetitions from the preceding\r\noperas, concerning which I have already said sufficient, we come to\r\nthe nightmare music, where Wagner once more manifests that miraculous\r\ngift of depicting, in terms of music, light and colour, a personal\r\nemotion. We can see the flickering lights glaring amongst the trees\r\nand feel Mime's terror.\r\n\r\nThe forge scene is one of Wagner's most stupendous efforts--for really\r\ninspired, not mechanical, energy it is by far the greatest thing in\r\nthe opera. As Siegfried sets to work pulling the bellows, his first\r\ncall \"Nothung!\" (the name of the Sword) is practically the same as the\r\ncobbler's song in the _Mastersingers_; but immediately after it goes\r\noff into a sheer song of spring and the joy of spring; while the\r\nbellows groan and the fire roars the feeling of growing green forest\r\nlife overflows into the music, and the intoxicating exhilaration is\r\nexpressed as only Wagner himself had expressed it before. When the\r\nhammering business begins we again find a likeness to the Sachs music,\r\nbut what a dissimilarity from the petty tapping of Mime! Mime's\r\ntheme, and that of all the Nibelung smiths, is characteristic enough;\r\nthey are not contemptible in themselves, though through them we find\r\nthe whole tribe of these smiths to be contemptible; and the tremendous\r\nswing of this second section of Siegfried's song makes every other\r\nsmith's song seem by comparison contemptible. Finally, when Nothung is\r\nready for action there is a coruscation of light from the orchestra as\r\nthe Sword theme, which, of course, we have heard long before, and the\r\nSiegfried-the-hunter theme are blared out and the anvil is split.\r\n\r\nMany other points must be left until later. I wish for the present to\r\ngive a notion of Wagner's powers at the time he wrote the earlier\r\nportions of _Siegfried_. Had the whole opera been equal to these\r\nportions it might have ranked with the _Valkyrie_. But though his\r\npowers were not yet on the wane, as we get on we shall see that the\r\nsubject was getting a little stale. He had not the smallest hope of\r\nseeing his work performed. If ever a man wrote purely for posterity it\r\nwas Wagner at this period; and though the general inspiration remained\r\nas deep and powerful as ever, we cannot be surprised if the continuous\r\nwhite heat of the _Valkyrie_ was checked and broken very often. The\r\nsurprising thing is that so circumstanced he achieved so much.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe story of the next Act is so simple that I shall deal with it and\r\nthe music at the same time. Near Hate-cave black Alberich, who first\r\nsteals the gold, ceaselessly watches: he cannot gain the gold, but its\r\nattraction is irresistible. So he watches while we hear the snarling\r\nmusic associated with him; and we can feel all the old-time horror of\r\nthe malignant semi-deities of the black forests and streams and caves.\r\nMime and he dispute angrily: Siegfried is about to slay the dragon,\r\nthe \"Wurm,\" and the question is who is to have the gold. The music is\r\nall of the sort that Wagner alone after Weber could write--wild, full\r\nat times of frenzied energy, full also, if so forced a phrase may be\r\npermitted, of black colour--black-green made audible as was the thick\r\ndarkness that might be felt made to be felt by Handel. Anger cannot be\r\ndirectly expressed in music; but these dreary snarling noises from the\r\norchestra and the peculiar use made of the human voice--a use to be\r\nreferred to later--enable Wagner to indicate it indirectly in a way\r\neffective on the stage. (We may note once again the contrast between\r\ntwo successive scenes--the brilliance, the straightforward vigour of\r\nthe close of Act I, and these tortuous phrases at the beginning of Act\r\nII.) Day begins to lighten, and Siegfried enters; he reclines on a\r\ngreen bank and hearkens to a bird carolling amidst the rustling\r\nbranches. He tries to imitate its notes on a reed cut with his sword,\r\nthat emits strange noises; and at last, annoyed by his lack of\r\nsuccess, he petulantly blows a blast on his horn. This arouses Fafner,\r\nwho grumbles and discloses his hiding-place; and presently an\r\nextraordinary reptile, one the like of which never was on sea or land,\r\ncomes forth to destroy the intruder. Siegfried (like the ordinary\r\naudience) seems disposed to laugh, but when the monster opens its\r\ngiant jaws and sends out flames and steam, and red lights begin to\r\nglare in its eyes, he sees serious matters are at hand. He prepares\r\nfor combat, and the battle is terrific, if not very convincing. At\r\nlast, however, he penetrates the odd brute in a vital part; it rolls\r\nover and makes dying prophecies; at the last it asks its conqueror's\r\nname and, having learnt it, groans that name once and dies. Siegfried\r\nthereupon penetrates into the cave and returns with the hoard; then he\r\nthrows himself once more upon the green bank.\r\n\r\nIf the reader thinks I treat this episode rather flippantly, let me\r\npromptly admit that this is so. It is pantomime of the most grotesque\r\nsort, not serious opera. The dragon would not frighten a child. The\r\nwhole thing is an artistic mistake: the fight should take place with\r\nthe beast wholly or nearly out of sight: an occasional lash of the\r\ntail, with plenty of smoke and red fire, would be much more effective\r\nthan this construction of lath and pasteboard. The music hardly ever\r\nreaches a high level. There is not in existence any fine music\r\ndescriptive of any form of fighting; and here slashing passages on the\r\nstrings, blares of the brass, shrieks of the wood-wind, do not cover\r\nthe inevitable failure of invention. Fafner's dying speech is better,\r\nfor Wagner had something urgent to say on his own account: he wishes\r\nto urge on us the significance of Siegfried's coming career; and he\r\ndoes it with immense impressiveness. The day of the Ending of the gods\r\ncomes a little nearer when Siegfried takes possession of the Ring and\r\nplaces it on his finger. As was arranged from the beginning of time,\r\nthings are taking their course; Fate, answering none who questions,\r\nworks out her plans silently, mysteriously, inexorably. A sense of our\r\ndarkness regarding our destiny fills the music with a profound\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\nIf there has been too much of the pantomimic grotesque so far, Wagner\r\nsoon offers us compensations. The music now is amongst his freshest\r\nand most fragrant. A reservation must be made touching the absolute\r\nperfection of its beauty, but only a minute one. When first the bird\r\nsang sweetly in the branches outspread above Siegfried's head we heard\r\nthe beginning of the piece known in the concert room as \"Forest\r\nVoices,\" the most exquisite sylvan picture ever done in music. A low\r\nrippling figure, or rather part-figure and part-melodic theme, is\r\nheard: it mounts higher, descends again, sways about, swells and dies\r\naway; other melodies are interwoven with it; it becomes more rapid in\r\nits motion, and grows louder until we feel the wind getting up and the\r\nleaves dancing, and then comes the voice of the bird. This may sound a\r\nlittle high-falutin', but is the only way in which I can render my\r\nimpression. The picture is so absolutely convincing that many readers\r\nwho, like myself, first heard the thing in a concert room will\r\nremember that with the one hint conveyed by the title no scenery was\r\nneeded to make its meaning and feeling quite clear. The bird-voice is\r\nmanaged with consummate art: a penny toy would have enabled the\r\ncomposer to give a faithful imitation of bird-song--and would have\r\nspoilt the faithfulness of the whole picture. So Wagner has translated\r\nthe real bird-song into terms of art, and thereby given us its spirit\r\nwhile sufficiently suggestive of the original. It is not sustained for\r\nlong. Siegfried, as I have described, tries to cut a reed so as to\r\nimitate it, and there is some innocent fooling as he only gets odd\r\nsqueaks out of his instrument; then comes the combat with the Dragon,\r\nand he returns to his place. The one tender spot in his nature,\r\nawakened by the thought of his mother, who died for him, is touched by\r\nthe bird-song and the sweet morning; he is filled with vague,\r\nsorrowful yearnings--and presently the bird sings again. But after\r\nkilling the monster he had touched its blood--it burnt his finger,\r\nwhich he instinctively put in his mouth; and the taste of the blood\r\nendows him with the faculty of understanding the speech of beasts and\r\nbirds. So now when the bird sings it is a human voice uttering words.\r\nIt is with regard to this I make a reservation. The abrupt entrance of\r\nthe human voice startles one: the picture is for a moment distorted,\r\nmade artificial. After a few hearings one grows accustomed to the\r\nincongruity; but I still think Wagner would perhaps have done better\r\nto let Siegfried tell us what he hears. This is, however, a mere\r\nguess; and it savours of impudence to suggest what so great a composer\r\nas Wagner should have done. The bird first warns Siegfried against\r\nMime. Mime crawls in with his basin of poisoned soup, meaning to offer\r\nhis \"son\" some refreshment after the labours of the morning. In\r\nwhining accents, verging on the ludicrous--for I have said that Mime\r\nis semi-comic--he professes his love; but the dragon's blood also\r\nenables Siegfried to understand what he means, and, just as Beckmesser\r\nin singing the stolen song utters words very different from those he\r\nmeans, so Mime in what he intends to be affectionate strains tells us\r\nhis real purpose. Siegfried plays with him as a cat plays with a\r\nmouse, and at last plunges the sword into him--and from a thicket\r\ncomes the malignant laugh of Alberich, barked to Mime's own hammering\r\nphrase. Disgusted, Siegfried returns to his resting place, but the\r\nbird again engages his attention: it sings of the maiden afar off on\r\nthe mountain sleeping hedged in by the fire through which he alone can\r\nbreak. Siegfried's longings take definite form: he will win the\r\nmaiden; the bird promises to lead him; it flutters off; he follows;\r\nthe curtain drops.\r\n\r\nThus ends one of Wagner's most splendid scenes--certainly the finest\r\nin this opera. The passion of the music, its vivid picturesque\r\nquality, its freshness, go to make it one of the many things of\r\nWagner's for which no parallel can be found. Wagner's technique had\r\nnow reached that supreme height which made _Tristan_ and the\r\n_Mastersingers_ possible; and the spontaneous energy of his\r\ninspiration was unabated. The Act, we may remember, was actually\r\ncompleted after those two operas, but it was planned and partially\r\nexecuted before.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nDuring the long interval that elapsed between the execution of the\r\nearlier portion of the Second Act of _Siegfried_ and the resumption of\r\nhis work many things happened to Wagner. He composed _Tristan_ and the\r\n_Mastersingers_; he went through his worst years of utter despair; he\r\nwas taken up by King Ludwig. As I have mentioned, he went to\r\nTriebschen to complete the _Ring_ for the sake of his conception of\r\nthe hero Siegfried--and he went there a jaded man. And there is an\r\nunmistakable quality in the music of his Third Act. In _Tristan_ and\r\nthe _Mastersingers_ we have the perfectly mature Wagner; inspiration,\r\ninvention and technical accomplishment are perfectly balanced. What we\r\nfeel immediately in the third act of _Siegfried_ is a certain\r\nover-ripeness--as if the writing of music had become too easy. As we\r\nproceed I shall give some instances of this, though not so many as\r\nmight be given.\r\n\r\nSiegfried is now on the point of reaching the height of his fortunes.\r\nHe has the Sword, has killed the Dragon, secured the Ring and the\r\nmagic cap which will enable him to change himself into any shape he\r\npleases. Following the fluttering bird he comes to a pass on the\r\nmountain-side and encounters Wotan who, we know, had sworn that none\r\nwho feared his Spear should pass through the fire. He endeavours to\r\nstop the Hero, who shatters the Spear. Siegfried passes on; the flames\r\nleap up at his approach and subside as he boldly goes on. He finds\r\nBrünnhilda sleeping, awakes her with a kiss, overcomes her resistance,\r\nand the opera concludes with a triumphant love-duet. This is the\r\nskeleton of what is, dramatically if not musically, the most important\r\nof the three acts.\r\n\r\nThe curtain rises on this mountain pass in a dark dawn: an angry cold\r\nwind whistles and screams, and wild wet clouds are flying. Wotan\r\nstands there; presently he summons Erda, who rises, as in the\r\n_Rhinegold_, with a \"frosty light\" about her; he asks her what will be\r\nthe upshot of the day's doings. Her answer is no answer, and Wotan\r\nreplies for her: Siegfried will pass and take Brünnhilda--and then the\r\nEnd of the gods. The dramatic object of this scene I have never been\r\nable to grasp. Both Wotan and Erda know what the end will be; and I\r\ncan only take it that Wagner, fully aware that each of the constituent\r\noperas of the _Ring_ would certainly be performed separately, wanted\r\nto make his intention and the whole plot clear to those who had not\r\nseen the earlier parts of the work. Musically it shows signs of that\r\nover-ripeness I have just spoken of. The introduction is magnificent:\r\nthe leaping figure on the strings, the subject that serves for Erda\r\nhere (and elsewhere in different shapes for all the elemental beings),\r\nmounting up against it, the phrase expressive of Wotan's anguish\r\n(from Act II of the _Valkyrie_), the Spear theme rising by degrees and\r\never increasing force, the whole leading up to the Wanderer\r\nmusic--these at once tell a story and paint a picture of tempest\r\namongst the wild mountainous rocks. Had Schopenhauer heard this music\r\nit would have justified his remark about the use of clouds. From the\r\nmoment that Wotan begins his invocation the quality falls: the motive\r\nis, for Wagner, a poor, mechanical thing; and an appearance of life is\r\nonly kept up by marked rhythms, forced changes of key, and noisy\r\norchestration. Erda's music is not on the highest level. The colour is\r\nthere, and an atmosphere is gained largely through the employment of\r\nmusic previously heard; but the vocal phrases are not true song, nor\r\nthat blending of true song with recitative of which we have already\r\nnoticed so many examples.\r\n\r\nWith the approach of Siegfried, however, at once the superb artist\r\nshows himself: a complete piece made from the fire-music, the\r\nbird-music, and Siegfried the hunter's theme is begun, to be\r\ninterrupted for a while, then resumed and worked up into a glorious\r\nthing. The interruption is the scene between Siegfried and his\r\ngrandfather the Wanderer. It brings the tragedy of Wotan more vividly\r\nthan ever before us, and is from every point of view not only\r\njustified but necessary. Siegfried scoffs at the old dotard, who loves\r\nthe boy as his own flesh and blood (if one may say this of a pagan\r\ngod) doomed to death by his forbear's ambition and errors. At last\r\nSiegfried, impatient to go on, smashes the Spear and ascends the path\r\nto where we see the distant glow of the flames. The music is supremely\r\nnoble and touching, with just a hint here and there of over-facility:\r\nI mean chiefly that the vocal phrases are not tense and full of\r\ncharacter as are those in the _Valkyrie_: they seem to have been _put\r\nin_ to fit the orchestral web. In an earlier chapter I spoke of this\r\nweakness in the _Ring_; and from this point onward till the end of\r\nWagner's writing days, unless he was writing undisguised song, the\r\nliability to this weakness increased. The over-ripeness shows itself\r\nalso in the structure of the music: the parts lack definition (as\r\nmicroscopists would say). Formalism is not at all a desirable thing;\r\nbut if we examine the great works, differing widely in character,\r\n_Tristan_, the _Mastersingers_ and the _Valkyrie_, we find the utmost\r\ndistinctness combined with perfect freedom and expressiveness. Even as\r\nearly as the Second Act of _Siegfried_ the freedom threatens to\r\ndegenerate into sloppiness--or, to put it rather more mildly, at least\r\ninto vagueness. Perhaps he felt this himself; for certainly at the end\r\nof the act we are discussing, and often in the _Dusk of the Gods_, he\r\ngives us straightforward song. At best his song-recitative is sublime;\r\nat worst it is insufferably tedious.\r\n\r\nThe gorgeous journey to the mountain-top is resumed as Siegfried\r\ndisappears amongst the rocks and Wotan goes off. We are now done with\r\nhim: his last ineffectual stand for supremacy having collapsed, as he\r\nfore-knew it would, he returns to Valhalla to await the end. There is\r\ndarkness for a while; then light returns, and we find the scene that\r\nof the termination of the _Valkyrie_. The mountain-top is sunlit;\r\nBrünnhilda's horse Grani is contentedly at graze; Brünnhilda, covered\r\nwith her shield, her spear by her side, sleeps, motionless. Siegfried\r\ncomes over some rocks at the back of the stage, gazes around him in\r\nwonder, finally discovers Brünnhilda, and with a kiss awakens her. At\r\nfirst the godhood has not quite gone out of her, and \"Woe! woe!\" she\r\ncries, as she realises her fate. But womanhood is strong within her;\r\nshe yields; hails Siegfried as the highest hero of all the world, and\r\nthe opera ends.\r\n\r\nThe music is nearly throughout the superb Wagner. The long ascending\r\nviolin passage which accompanies Siegfried's amazed gazing at the\r\nwonders around him, chief amongst them Brünnhilda, is imagined with\r\nabsolute truth; Brünnhilda's Greeting to the sun is Wagner in the\r\nplenitude of his powers, blending music which depicts her outspread\r\narms with human rapture in an incomparable way; Siegfried's masterful\r\nand passionate entreaties are quite in the strain of Tristan, though\r\nthe Scandinavian atmosphere prevails; Brünnhilda's awe-stricken song,\r\n\"O Siegfried, highest hero,\" interprets the birth of love in a woman's\r\nbreast with, again, absolute truth; and that the man who had lately\r\nwritten _Tristan_ could write such a finale is not the least\r\nastounding of Wagner's feats.\r\n\r\nThe Siegfried Idyll, made of the Siegfried Themes, is, in a word, the\r\nmost beautiful thing he ever wrote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n'THE DUSK OF THE GODS'\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThis, the last of Wagner's really great works, was composed in hot\r\nhaste for the first Bayreuth festival. True, the festival did not take\r\nplace until some time after its completion; but at the moment Wagner\r\nanticipated an immediate performance. There is nothing more pathetic,\r\nnothing sadder, than the picture of the mighty world-composer\r\nstruggling against petty odds to complete what might have been a\r\nworld-masterpiece, and failing because of his hurry. He was sixty\r\nyears of age; worn by constant combat; worried even then by stupid\r\npersecutions and the uncertainties of life; and he went on, if not\r\njoyfully, at least indomitably, unconquerably. The result is a work\r\ngigantic in idea, but far too rapid and facile in the execution. His\r\npen seems to have run of its own accord; the scenes are spread out to\r\na length positively appalling; pages on pages show no trace of\r\ninspiration. Yet the _Dusk of the Gods_ is an opera no other composer\r\ncould have achieved; and with all its defects it will be a high and\r\nholy joy to generations not yet born.\r\n\r\nThe last hour of the old gods has come; the Norns spin their web on\r\nthe Valkyries' rock; it breaks, and they sink into the earth, knowing\r\nthat all is finished. Dawn breaks, and Siegfried and Brünnhilda come\r\nout of their cavern; Siegfried must now go forth to deeds of\r\nderring-do, for, like Lovelace, \"how could he love her, dear, so much,\r\nloved he not honour more?\" She bids him go, and he goes; the flames\r\nimmediately spring up again round her dwelling--for what reason Wagner\r\ndoes not explain. Neither does he explain why Brünnhilda does not\r\ntravel with her husband--the explanation is made only too obvious\r\nafterwards. He travels to the Rhine, and there meets Hagen, Günther\r\nand Günther's sister Gutruna. Hagen, the son of Alberich, is more or\r\nless like Mime, a half-super-natural being, malignant, diabolical,\r\nwith only one idea, that of getting possession of the gold, and, above\r\nall, of the Ring. He knows of Siegfried's \"deed,\" and knows that\r\nSiegfried is coming that way; but he keeps the story to himself, and\r\ntells Günther and Gutruna of the fearless hero and of Brünnhilda\r\nsleeping on the mountain-top encircled by fire. Günther desires the\r\nwoman, Gutruna the man. But only Siegfried can pass through the fire.\r\nPat to the moment he arrives, and enters leading Grani. Hagen offers\r\nhim drink which contains a powder which destroys his memory; he\r\nforgets all about Brünnhilda, but not, apparently, about the magic\r\ncap; he gazes in rapture at Gutruna, and in a few minutes the pact is\r\nmade--Siegfried shall take Günther's form and win Brünnhilda for him;\r\nin return he will have Gutruna, who is more than willing. The two men\r\ngo off together, and the scene changes again to the Valkyries' rock.\r\nBrünnhilda sits alone looking at the Ring; Waltraute, one of the\r\nValkyries, rushes in and demands that Ring. She relates how for want\r\nof it Wotan, dreading that it may fall into the hands of Alberich,\r\nsits gloomy and silent in Valhalla. But Brünnhilda is now wholly woman\r\nand has no sympathy with the gods; she refuses the Ring, and Waltraute\r\ngoes off in despair. The flames begin to flicker and dance;\r\nSiegfried's horn is heard; and presently he enters in Günther's form,\r\nor at least as nearly in it as can be managed on the stage. He claims\r\nand seizes Brünnhilda, sends her into the sleeping-chamber, and,\r\nswearing truth to his new friend Günther, follows with his drawn sword\r\nready to place between him and his bride.\r\n\r\nSo the act closes. Brünnhilda's horror and shame are unspeakable; she\r\ncannot understand; Wotan had promised her the great hero, and this\r\npromise is broken and a last humiliation inflicted on her. The act is\r\nintolerably long; even were every moment crowded with Wagner's most\r\nglorious music the strain on our attention would be terrific. But the\r\nmusic is by no means uniformly of Wagner's best; for pages on pages\r\nhis sheer craftsmanship fairly gallops away with him. The Norn scene\r\nis as purely theatrical as anything he wrote; the atmosphere is, so to\r\nspeak, artificially weird. The scene between Siegfried and Brünnhilda\r\nis more inspired; and the journey to the Rhine is one of Wagner's\r\nfinest bits of picture-painting. The change of feeling towards the end\r\nis superb: a sense of foreboding and dread comes into the music and\r\nprepares us for the coming disaster. But when the curtain rises on\r\nthe hall of the Gibichungs we at once get more artificiality and\r\ntheatricality. In using the word theatrical I do not mean there is any\r\nreturn to, for instance, the _Rienzi_ style: the music is theatrical\r\nin Wagner's own later way: it seems to fit the situation, but the\r\nappearance is an appearance only: the stuff is superficial: the\r\nfeeling of the moment is not expressed--the music, in a word, is\r\nessentially the same as that of many inferior but clever opera\r\ncomposers, only, of course, the Wagner idiom is always there. The\r\nWaltraute scene is fine, being largely made up of old material; but I\r\ncannot say much for the scene between Brünnhilda and Siegfried. In\r\nthis first act two important themes are introduced, the Tarnhelm theme\r\nand that of the draught of forgetfulness. The first is of the\r\ntheatrical type: it is a leitmotiv of the same sort as Lohengrin's\r\nwarning to Elsa; the other is a miracle, one of the wonders of music.\r\nIt gives one in a brief phrase Siegfried's dazed sense that something\r\nhas gone from him, a strange sense of loss; and it has the pathos the\r\nmoment demands. As for the draught of forgetfulness itself, it cannot\r\nbe explained as symbolical of anything; it must be accepted as we\r\naccept the Tarnhelm and the Rhinemaidens and black Alberich.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIn the Second Act the scene is again the Gibichungs' hall. Siegfried\r\nand Günther are away, and Hagen watches by night; his father,\r\nAlberich, crawls up from the river and counsels him as to how to get\r\npossession of the Ring; then he disappears as dawn begins to show. The\r\nmusic is weird and sinister in Wagner's finest manner. Siegfried comes\r\nin and says Günther and his bride will soon arrive, and goes off with\r\nGutruna, happy as a child; in a magnificent piece of music, largely\r\nconstructed of a harsh phrase associated with Hagen, he (Hagen) calls\r\nup the clansmen and women; a pompous bit of chorus greets Günther and\r\nBrünnhilda, and then once more we are plunged into a sea of\r\ntheatricality. To her amazement, Brünnhilda finds Siegfried there with\r\nhis new bride, unmindful of her. In rage she denounces him and\r\ndeclares he has shared the joys of love with her; he denies it; but\r\nGünther is shamed, and has no doubt that Siegfried has played him\r\nfalse. Siegfried goes merrily off, and Günther, Hagen and Brünnhilda\r\nswear that he must die. In the music we get any amount of physical\r\nenergy and dramatic emphasis; but we know this is no longer the Wagner\r\nof the _Valkyrie_. I pass over the Act briefly now, because I can only\r\nrepeat what I have said before. Of course all the consummate skill of\r\nthe master is there.\r\n\r\nThe Third Act opens by the river-side. Siegfried has wandered away\r\nfrom a hunting party, and is attracted by the song of the\r\nRhinemaidens--a regular set piece in the oldest-fashioned of forms,\r\nbut marvellously beautiful. The nymphs try to coax him to throw them\r\nthe Ring, which he had wrested from Brünnhilda; he refuses, and they\r\ntell him that this day he must die. The other hunters come in, and\r\nSiegfried is asked to tell of his adventures, and as he does so Hagen\r\noffers him a cup of wine into which he dropped another powder;\r\nSiegfried's memory gradually returns, and to Günther's horror he\r\nrelates how he first scaled the mountain, passed the fire and won\r\nBrünnhilda. He means on the first occasion, but it shames Günther once\r\nagain. Hagen points in the air and asks Siegfried what he sees above\r\nhim; two black ravens fly over. Siegfried turns to look at them, and\r\nHagen instantly thrusts a spear into his back; the ravens wing their\r\nway to Valhalla to tell Wotan that the fatal hour has come. In a\r\nsublime passage Siegfried the dying hero sings of Brünnhilda, and\r\ndies. Every one save Hagen is horror-stricken; the body is picked up\r\nand carried downward through the moonlit mists over the mountain, and\r\nthe gorgeous funeral march is played. This is built up on Wagner's\r\ncustomary plan: it tells the story of the Volsung race, now ended by\r\nthe death of Siegfried.\r\n\r\nIn the second scene of the Act there is one fine passage--Brünnhilda's\r\nlong address--and the rest is manufactured with dexterity and quite\r\nuninspired. The body is brought in; Hagen wishes to take the Ring, and\r\na thrill is sent through us as the dead man's arm rises threateningly.\r\nGünther interferes, and Hagen kills him; Brünnhilda comes on and sees\r\nclearly everything; Gutruna claims Siegfried as hers--\"he never was\r\nyours; he is mine,\" Brünnhilda replies, and (by trick of true\r\nstage-craft) Gutruna is seen to kneel down by the side of her dead\r\nbrother. She is absolutely alone--even Siegfried, dead, is taken from\r\nher, and she instinctively creeps to the only thing that is in any\r\nsense hers. Brünnhilda orders the funeral fire to be built; the body\r\nis put on it and consumed: Brünnhilda mounts Grani and scatters the\r\nashes, and with them the Ring, into the river; the waters rise, and\r\nHagen rushes after the Ring, to be drawn down; Wotan's power went when\r\nthe spear was shattered, and now that the Ring is returned to the\r\nRhine no other power controls Loge. He flares up, and we see Valhalla\r\non high in flames.\r\n\r\nSo ends the _Dusk of the Gods_ and the whole gigantic cycle. A noble\r\nrace has come and gone, and the world is prepared to make a fresh\r\nstart. I have discussed the music as we went along, and there is\r\nnothing more to add.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n'PARSIFAL'; THE END; THE MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nAfter Wagner had completed the _Ring_, a work which, in regard to its\r\ngigantic size and proportions, stands without a parallel in music, he\r\nwas an exhausted and beaten man. Outwardly he was a highly prosperous\r\nmusician--more successful from some points of view than Mendelssohn or\r\nMeyerbeer: at least he had, without means, achieved a greater triumph\r\nthan they, starting with their fathers' thousands or millions, had\r\ndreamed of. No Mendelssohn, no Meyerbeer, no Rossini, would have\r\ndreamed of gaining a king, even the king of a minor bankrupt state, as\r\nhis lackey--and his generous paymaster. After the first Bayreuth\r\nfestival a Rossini would have retired as swiftly as such a person\r\ncould with his percentage of the gross profits, leaving the guarantors\r\nto straighten the little matter of the deficit; Meyerbeer had too much\r\nof cold cunning in him to have gone on such an adventure at all;\r\nMendelssohn would have paid up everything and shaken the dust of _his_\r\nBayreuth off his feet for ever and a six-days week longer. I take\r\nthese three because they are three of the most successful financial\r\ncomposers the world has seen; minor prophets of their order might be\r\nadded. That is what they would have done: made a little money they\r\ndid not need and retired from a hard conflict. Wagner was more\r\nsuccessful than they. He never accumulated the thousands of marks or\r\nducats or francs that they did: he did not want them, but in\r\nproportion to his needs he accumulated more; he was richer than they\r\nwere, as Diogenes in his tub was richer than Alexander. Wagner's tub,\r\nit may be remarked, was a preciously comfortable one, and he made no\r\npretence about it being anything else. He was a successful man of\r\nbusiness; in spirit he was broken, exhausted, defeated.\r\n\r\nThat is the first point to be considered; the next is a corollary.\r\nThis man of dashed, broken hopes still needed the driving force of\r\neither human passions, griefs or sorrows, or of great human ideals,\r\nbefore he could compose ten notes. It is no desire of mine to scoff at\r\nthe Schopenhauerian, Feuerbachian notions working in Wagner's brain\r\nwhen he planned the _Ring_, and wrote its finest music; in art--as in\r\nbusiness, if it comes to that--one judges by results and results only.\r\nBut we can see that it was these ridiculous ideas, as perhaps I have\r\nalready pointed out, that were the postilion's whip to Wagner's\r\nPegasus. Of some men it can be said that no one knows anything of the\r\npostilion's whip: of every artist concerning whom a fair tail of facts\r\nis available and consultable we find a very distinct whip. We may\r\nlaugh at the idea of the \"stories\" to which Beethoven worked: who\r\nwould laugh at the Fifth Symphony would not even be laughed at. And I\r\nhave not the slightest hesitation in affirming that when Wagner set\r\nto work on _Parsifal_ his most eager and greedy desire was to show the\r\nworld that he desired nothing. Knowing Bayreuth a failure, fancying\r\nhis whole life a failure, from a particular point of view, one idea\r\nseized hold on him--- the idea that those who did not like his music\r\nwere in a pitiable condition, and compassion exhorted him to rescue\r\nthem, to redeem them. He meant to heap coals of fire upon a generation\r\nthat refused to recognise him as a prophet. He did it--with a double\r\nvengeance: he made the detractors come to his knees and he made a\r\nfortune out of them--them alone. For Bayreuth never became a\r\nprofitable investment for Jewish money until the one great Christian\r\ndrama of modern times was produced there.\r\n\r\n_Parsifal_, in one form or another, had long fermented in Wagner's\r\nbrain. At first it was--incongruous though the thing may seem--either\r\n_Jesus of Nazareth_ or _Wieland the Smith_; then _Parzival_ grew out\r\nof the Siegfried idea; and at length, stimulated by the attentions and\r\nhelp of poor Ludwig, he settled on _Parsifal_. These are matters not\r\nof opinion, but of historical fact. Ludwig, when not masquerading in\r\nwoman's clothing, or ordering it from Paris, or appearing at private\r\nperformances in one opera or another, suffered from great attacks of\r\nreligion; and, unhappily for the art of music, what appealed to his\r\ndiseased brain from one side appealed to Wagner's tired brain from the\r\nother side. Ludwig asked him to complete _Parsifal_ and he did so. I\r\ndoubt whether without the royal request he ever would have done so.\r\nBut in doing so he, as Americans say, \"struck lucky.\" Throughout\r\nWestern Europe you have only to bawl the word \"religion\" and your\r\nfortune is made; in America it is the same; on the two continents\r\ninnumerable fortunes have been made by bawling the word \"religion.\" So\r\nWagner's conviction, Ludwig's desire, and advertisement possibilities,\r\nall coincided; and thenceforth Bayreuth flourished--financially, if\r\nnot artistically or morally.\r\n\r\nI shall devote little attention to _Parsifal_. The plot would disgrace\r\nWagner's memory if we did not know it to be the work of his tired-out\r\nold age. The central idea is that of Renunciation; and I will give the\r\nreader a skeleton, but a fair skeleton, of the plot, and ask him, Who\r\nrenounces anything? who gains anything by renouncing? or loses\r\nanything by not renouncing? and, above all, what is any one called on\r\nto renounce?\r\n\r\nAt the Montsalvat of _Lohengrin_--ah! what a different\r\nMontsalvat--Amfortas, lord of the tribe of monks, has flirted with a\r\nlady, and a magician, Klingsor, has seized the sacred spear with which\r\nChrist's side was pierced and inflicted on Amfortas an incurable\r\nwound. That is the state of affairs when the curtain rises. Gurnemanz,\r\na faithful warder, talks with sundry squires, not yet fully degraded\r\nto the order of knighthood, and tells them how through a certain\r\nwondrous woman Amfortas fell from his high estate. The wondrous woman,\r\nKundry, disguised as a sort of Indian squaw, enters, coming, she says,\r\nfrom far lands; exhausted, she flings herself in a thicket to\r\nsleep--sleep--she says. Gurnemanz does not know who she is--nor, for\r\nthat small matter, do I--but she comes and serves these knight-monks\r\nfaithfully for whiles and then disappears; and generally, it seems,\r\nduring her period of disappearance disaster falls on some treasured\r\npearl of a saint of a knight. Enter Parsifal, \"the pure\r\nfool\"--Siegfried with all his bull-strength and energy shorn away. He\r\ncarries a bow and arrow, and promptly shoots a Swan, one of the prides\r\nof Montsalvat. He is too stupid to understand that he has done any\r\nwrong--wrong to a helpless bird or his own nature. Gurnemanz explains\r\nin very unconvincing accents; Parsifal, the poor, \"pure\" fool, bursts\r\ninto tears, breaks his weapons and throws them away. And now the\r\nreader must bear with me if I am both tedious and inexplicable in my\r\nexplanation. At some unknown period in the past it was prophesied that\r\nonly the \"pure fool\" taught by suffering could redeem suffering\r\nAmfortas: mankind, that is, could only be made perfect by a perfect\r\nidiot. Gurnemanz thinks he has found the required man--and he has, if\r\nonly he knew it--and he takes him on the most curious promenade in the\r\nhistory of mankind--to the Hall of the Grail. The two men do not walk:\r\nit is the scenery that walks. \"Here,\" says Gurnemanz, \"time and space\r\nare one.\"\r\n\r\nArrived there, we are confronted by a scene much more Oriental than\r\nanything we know of mediæval Christianity: a sort of mosque with a\r\nhuge dome, a circular set of Lockhart's Cocoa-rooms tables and\r\nbenches; at the back a mysterious catafalque. The pure fool is pushed\r\naside; Amfortas is carried in; he screams in agony of spirit; and then\r\nthe service begins. It is a sheer burlesque of the Lord's Supper. When\r\nthe last chords of the mysterious choir in the dome have died away,\r\nGurnemanz asks Parsifal what he comprehends of it all. \"Nothing,\"\r\nParsifal replies, and is immediately turned out of doors.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the guileless fool has already been indicated: this--as\r\nit seems to us to-day--idiotic notion of the eighteenth century\r\nstarted Wagner on the notion that if a modern child, with all the\r\ndeveloped brain of a modern child, could suddenly be transplanted into\r\na state of nature, all would be well with the world. What could\r\npossibly happen? But it is silly to ask the question: the whole\r\njuvenile population of the earth would have to be so transplanted, and\r\nthey would have to find a new earth to live on--at least an earth not\r\nfrequented by modern men and women.\r\n\r\nIn the next Act we are taken to Klingsor's magic castle. Klingsor\r\ncalls up Kundry and changes his castle into an enchanted garden full\r\nof flower-maidens; Parsifal comes in, and, though curious about the\r\nmaidens, does not know what they would be at; he angrily drives them\r\noff; Kundry calls him. She tells him of the death of his mother who\r\nhad loved him so dearly; he again weeps and learns the meaning of\r\ncompassion; Kundry kisses him, and he learns the meaning of sex and\r\ntemptation. In horror he casts her from him; Klingsor throws the spear\r\nat him--the sacred Spear with which Christ's side was wounded, stolen\r\nby Klingsor from Montsalvat--it remains suspended above his head; he\r\nseizes and waves it, and at once garden, flower-maidens and all are\r\nreduced to withered stalks and leaves. Parsifal returns, an\r\n\"enlightened\" fool, and by touching the wound of Amfortas, cures him,\r\nbecoming himself head of the order.\r\n\r\nThe whole affair is a spectacle which I must say is disgusting to\r\nhealthy minds. The insinuations are frightful. Consider, reader,\r\nseriously for a moment: Parsifal--Siegfried grown to manhood--knows\r\nand cares nothing about womankind. As soon as he knows what a woman is\r\nhe revolts, learns through that knowledge and by his acquaintance with\r\nsuffering--acquaintance, I say, because he himself has never\r\nsuffered--that there are two cures for all the woes of humanity.\r\nDiscard women and pity the men. The thing is absurd, and suggests that\r\nthe mighty genius was on the verge of imbecility. But the desire to\r\nplease mad Ludwig accounts for it all in a very undesirable fashion.\r\n\r\nOf the music it is not necessary to say more than that some of it is\r\nfine. For the most part it lacks virility, though there are passages\r\nof marvellous loveliness. The flower-maidens' waltz shows what Wagner\r\ncould do in that way; the Good Friday music, dating back to the\r\n_Lohengrin_ days, is sweet and fresh. But the quasi-religious music\r\nhas no charms for me.\r\n\r\nOf course the prelude is in its way, but only in its way, a beautiful\r\nthing. One almost hears the beating of angels' wings; the remnant of\r\nold church melody, fitted into the most modern of modern rhythms,\r\nsings out; the old _Tannhäuser_ and _Rienzi_ Dresden Amen comes out\r\npompously if not very effectively. On the whole a splendid _tour de\r\nforce_ is accomplished. But as soon as the singers are introduced we\r\nfeel the lack of the inspiration of former days; the writing is not\r\nvocal writing at all; it is simply notes chosen at will or at random\r\nto fit in with the chord sequences that were constantly shaping\r\nthemselves in Wagner's brain--not sequences that sprang, as he himself\r\nwould have expressed it, from \"the feeling.\" The woes of Amfortas are\r\ndescribed by the orchestra with a coldness that would have surprised\r\nor stunned Wagner in his _Tristan_ days: had Meyerbeer done it no\r\npaper would have carried his hot words. When Parsifal shoots the Swan,\r\nGurnemanz has two or three moments of true emotion: the rest ought to\r\nbe silence and is rubbish. The parody of the Lord's Supper is\r\ndeplorable: we have already heard enough of the music in the prelude\r\nwithout having to go through it again. Klingsor's magic music is mere\r\ntheatricalism; about Kundry's account of Parsifal's mother I remain in\r\nsome doubt: it is certainly beautiful, but to those of us who know the\r\ncorresponding scene in _Siegfried_ it is rather beggarly. Parsifal's\r\ndenunciation of Kundry after she has kissed him has not a word of the\r\nold truthful Wagner in it: Wagner had written so magnificently about\r\nthe ecstatic state of Palestrina and such of the other church\r\ncomposers as he knew, that he must, absolutely must, have realised\r\nthat his _Parsifal_ stuff was essentially untrue. Theatrically, the\r\nend of the Second Act sounds true; but it will not bear rehearing. The\r\nopening of the Third Act, again, is false; and the ending of the whole\r\nbusiness is tawdry stuff such as Meyerbeer might have been proud to\r\nsign. Technically, the old man retained his hand; but to compare this\r\ndecrepit stuff with the music of the _Valkyrie_ would be preposterous,\r\nand I have no wish to write more about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n_Parsifal_ having proved a tremendous success, Wagner went to work to\r\narrange for another festival. He had still a thousand opera plans\r\nbubbling in his brain; doubtless, with his unconquerable vitality, he\r\nimagined he had twenty years of life before him; he meant to make a\r\nfinancial success of Bayreuth and to go on. The end came with awful\r\nunexpectedness. He went to Venice, conducted there his boyish Symphony\r\nin C, worked away at his _Parsifal_ arrangements; his heart ruptured\r\nand he died on February 13, 1883. He had lived the perfectly rounded\r\nlife, achieved the three-score-and-ten, done everything that a man can\r\ndo, and gone through more experiences than most men suffer. His death\r\nsent a shudder through Europe: one had come to think that such a man\r\ncould not possibly die. Swinburne wrote that we heard the news as \"a\r\nprophet who hears the word of God and may not flee.\" His vilest\r\ndetractors laid their homage at the dead man's feet. His widow laid\r\nher hair by his head. He was buried at his Villa Wahnfried, and rests\r\nthere for ever. Had ever such a life so perfectly beautiful an ending?\r\nWe must regard _Parsifal_ as the last sad quaverings of a beloved\r\nfriend: after that came peace, immortal peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAmongst musicians of the first rank stand four commanding, tremendous\r\nfigures. First comes Handel, by far the greatest personality of them\r\nall: him I beg permission to think the greatest man who has yet\r\nlived--greater than Cæsar or Napoleon. After him came Gluck, a\r\ntriumphant bourgeois; then Beethoven, whose domination was the result\r\nof his supreme genius and his bad temper; and, last, Wagner, whose\r\nsupreme genius and indomitable perseverance made him either an idol or\r\na terror to all who came in contact with him. Handel had an easy time;\r\nhe was of his period, he wrote for it, and only his native pugnacity\r\nlanded him in bankruptcy, and enabled him finally to win a fortune by\r\noratorio when no one would listen any longer to his operas. Gluck was\r\nfrom the first a popular composer: there were rows, it is true, but\r\nthey did not concern him; he had always an assured public. Beethoven\r\nhad throughout his working life an ample pension and the friendship of\r\nprinces. Wagner had no such friends until he was sixty years old; he\r\nhad no pension; he offended every opera director in Germany by telling\r\nthose gentry that they knew nothing of their business; he got mixed up\r\nwith revolutionists, and, mainly because he was a man of unusual\r\nability, was regarded as dangerous by every bureaucrat. He was fast\r\nbecoming a popular composer; and he left his successes behind him and\r\nwent on to change opera in a fashion never attempted by Gluck or any\r\nother composer. He was the most consummate contrapuntist of his age:\r\ntherefore the critics and professors declared he knew nothing about\r\ncounterpoint. He wrote the loveliest melodies of the nineteenth\r\ncentury: therefore it was generally agreed that the gift of melodic\r\ninvention had been denied him by a merciful Providence, who reserved\r\nthat gift for the Jews and their friends. He could hold neither his\r\ntongue nor his pen; if a bull may be excused, he replied before he was\r\nattacked, he hit back before he was struck. Proud as Satan, and\r\nthrough his pride a beggar; giving the world unheard-of delights, and\r\nyet dependent on the world for his bread; quarrelling with his\r\nfriends, picking quarrels with his supposed enemies, quarrelling with\r\nhis wife, running away with the wife of his best friend, theorising\r\nabout his art and promptly throwing his theories overboard, declaring\r\nhe would never allow excerpts from his operas to be given, nor even\r\none single opera of the _Ring_ to be given, and then allowing single\r\noperas to be given and conducting excerpts himself--there never was in\r\nthe world such a mass of contradictions as this musical apostle of\r\nuniversal peace born during the Napoleonic wars of 1813.\r\n\r\nAll this we may joyfully concede, knowing how much may be said on the\r\nother side. Wagner not only was the most stupendous personage born\r\ninto the nineteenth century: he was also one of the noblest, most\r\ngenerous men that have lived. There is not a mean trait in his\r\ncharacter. He endured privation, actual starvation; he was shamefully\r\ntreated; his wife did not believe in his genius; his simplest actions\r\nwere misinterpreted; frantic endeavours were made to hound him out of\r\nthe public life of opera; his publishers took advantage of his poverty\r\nto try to rob him; the scores of his masterpieces were returned\r\nunopened from theatres--in some cases they were not returned, and he\r\nhad infinite difficulty to secure them; moreover, he was ill all his\r\nlife: yet he never lost faith in mankind, and when he became,\r\ncomparatively, a well-to-do man he went on doing generous deeds as\r\nthough nothing had happened. With humbugs and pretenders he would have\r\nno dealings; but no genuine young artist ever asked his help in vain.\r\nHe spared even that rancorous decadent Nietzsche; he owned his\r\nobligations to that soul of chivalry, Liszt. He spared that mediocre\r\nperson Meyerbeer; he treated Mendelssohn with almost exaggerated\r\ncourtesy. He fought a terrific fight with all the forces of reaction\r\nand stupidity, and he came through untainted, unstained; if he sorely\r\nbelaboured the charlatans, he had all the finest musicians, and all\r\nother fine artists, on his side. The composer who won and held the\r\nfriendship and esteem of such men as Liszt, Cornelius, Jensen, Tausig\r\nand Bülow, not to mention the admiration of our own Swinburne, is not\r\na man to be dismissed by enumerating his defects. Some of us, I\r\nsuppose, will admit that we may possibly have our defects: none of us,\r\nso far as I know, can possibly claim his great qualities.\r\n\r\nHe was rather an undersized man with an uncontrollable temper. As he\r\nlet himself go in his music, so did he let himself go in his daily\r\nlife. To any but the most patient he must have proved an impossible\r\npersonage; Madame Cosima Wagner must have possessed the temper of an\r\nangel and the understanding of an archangel to put up with him. We see\r\nthat every one did put up with him; every one who knew him had the\r\nsame faith in his genius as he himself had; every one who knew\r\nhim--really knew him--loved him. Those who did not know him belaboured\r\nhim in the press or by word of mouth, and much honour and profit did\r\nthey get by it. He stands unsmirched by the mud thrown by his\r\ndetractors; he stands undamaged even by the adulation of his admirers.\r\n\r\nLet us consider for a moment what the man's personal character and\r\nmomentum enabled him to achieve. Finely endowed personalities like\r\nMozart and Chopin did much: did they write a _Ring_ or a _Tristan_?\r\nThe question needs no answer. Did they or the still mightier Beethoven\r\ndream of creating a Bayreuth? In the midst of years of privation\r\nRichard Wagner planned and partly executed the _Ring_; he completed\r\n_Tristan_ and the _Mastersingers_; as quite a young man he had dreamed\r\nof a Bayreuth; as an old man he turned his dream into a reality. He\r\nhad his lieutenants--big men always have their lieutenants--but the\r\nidea, the purpose, and the force behind were his and nobody else's\r\nthan his. Bayreuth does not stand for very much to-day; in the\r\n'seventies it stood for a fierce attack on the general sloppiness of\r\nopera performances all the world over, for the setting up of an ideal\r\nto which there is no parallel in the history of the art of music.\r\nNothing but the personal force of this one man accomplished this\r\nthing--personal force accompanied by a wholehearted devotion to his\r\nart. I suppose the inventors of steam-engines and the builders of\r\ngiant dams have an ideal, too, in their crazy craniums, but they\r\ninvent and work with a very definite idea of personal gain. Wagner\r\nhoped for no gain, and he gained little, though, as I have said, as\r\nmuch as he wanted. He was helped by the only noble-hearted king born\r\ninto the nineteenth century; but he found that king and inspired him.\r\nHe risked everything for his idea; if his works have grown to be\r\nvaluable assets since his death, they were not during his lifetime. By\r\nunheard-of energy while suffering privation--even of the ordinary\r\nnecessities of life--he went on and created masterpieces, and then by\r\ncreating Bayreuth set up a standard of musical execution that no one\r\nbefore him had thought possible. All the great conductors of the last\r\nfifty years are, musically, his offspring. Without him we should have\r\nbeen without a Richter, or Richter's introducer to the English, an\r\nAlfred Schulz-Curtius; without these two men we should have no Robert\r\nNewman or Henry J. Wood. Wagner's influence has been further-reaching\r\nthan many of us think; and that influence was due not more to the\r\nconsummate skill of the musician than to the character of the man.\r\n\r\nOutside his musicianship the man had interests in everything human--in\r\npainting, sculpture, drama, poetry and prose. He made what we consider\r\nmistakes, as what man does not who is a product of a period of\r\npassionate revivals of human and humanising ideals?--but how few they\r\nare! They hardly count. He absorbed all the culture of all the\r\ncenturies. The Greek and Latin poets were as familiar to him as were\r\nthe English. Hardly a great book had been written which he did not\r\nknow familiarly. There is not a great picture or piece of sculpture in\r\nEurope he did not know. All came as grist to his mill. I end this book\r\nby joyfully hailing him as one of the half-dozen greatest minds the\r\nages have produced--the equal of Shakespeare, Handel, Mozart,\r\nBeethoven and Michael Angelo: a man it is an honour to have known as\r\nit is a disgrace to have scorned--the one man born into the last\r\ncentury that one can absolutely, without reservation, praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n_Abendzeitung_ (Dresden), 75\r\n\r\nApel, August, 41, 51\r\n\r\nAuber, D.F.E.,\r\n _Masaniello_, 47, 89;\r\n compared with Meyerbeer, 67, 68\r\n\r\nAvenarius, Eduard,\r\n marries Cäcilie Geyer, 72\r\n\r\nBakunin, Michael, 136, 196\r\n\r\nBaumgärtner, Wilhelm, 209\r\n\r\nBayreuth, 71, 323, 325-329, 400, 407, 409, 410\r\n\r\nBeethoven, Ludwig van, 25, 26, 330, 331, 347, 350, 356, 371, 408, 416;\r\n his influence on Wagner, 33-35, 42, 62;\r\n arrangements of, by Wagner, 37;\r\n _Fidelio_, 148\r\n\r\nBellini, Vincenzo,  50, 92, 116, 150, 178\r\n\r\nBennett, Joseph, 328\r\n\r\nBerlioz, Hector,\r\n Wagner's criticism on, 71;\r\n tragedy of his life, 72;\r\n praises the _Flying Dutchman_, 128;\r\n in London, 225;\r\n his relations with Wagner, 226;\r\n his \"Ride to the Abyss,\" 370\r\n\r\nBethmann, Heinrich, 52, 54\r\n\r\nBispham, David, 277\r\n\r\nBrahms, Johannes, 164\r\n\r\nBrangaena, 245-248\r\n\r\nBrazil,\r\n Wagner receives a commission from, 230, 237\r\n\r\nBrendel, Karl Franz, 50, 218\r\n\r\nBrockhaus, Friedrich,\r\n marries Louise Wagner, 32\r\n\r\nBülow, Cosima von,\r\n and Wagner, 60, 323-325\r\n\r\nBülow, Hans von, 71, 250, 418;\r\n serves his apprenticeship under Wagner, 208;\r\n married to Cosima Liszt, 323, 324\r\n\r\n\r\n_Communication to  my Friends_, 219\r\n\r\nCornelius, Peter, 71, 418\r\n\r\nCusins, W.G., 46, 134\r\n\r\n\r\nDannreuther, Edward, 37, 67\r\n\r\nDavison, J.W., 46\r\n\r\nDietsch, Pierre, 80\r\n\r\nDorn,  Heinrich, 32, 37, 39, 40, 57\r\n\r\n_Dusk of the Gods, The_, 178, 188, 325, 356, 373, 398;\r\n analysis and criticism, 400-406\r\n\r\nDvoràk, Anton,\r\n compared with Wagner, 291, 292\r\n\r\n\r\nElgar, Sir Edward, 291\r\n\r\n_End in Paris, An_, 212, 213\r\n\r\n_Europa_, 75\r\n\r\n\r\n_Feen, Die_, 42, 47, 48, 50, 52, 56, 60-63. 72, 86, 93, 137\r\n\r\nFeuerbach, Ludwig, 232, 408\r\n\r\nFischer, Wilhelm, 76, 126, 205, 206, 220, 231\r\n\r\n_Flying Dutchman, The_, 65, 66, 80, 81, 127, 128, 137, 170,\r\n   187, 219, 243, 356, 385;\r\n analysis and criticism, 94-120;\r\n produced at Zurich, 208\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gazette Musicale, La_, 70, 75\r\n\r\nGewandhaus Concerts, 33, 45, 46\r\n\r\nGeyer, Cäcilie, 14, 16, 30, 72\r\n\r\nGeyer, Ludwig, 4, 6-14;\r\n marries Frau Wagner, 8; his death, 14\r\n\r\nGeyer, goldsmith at Eisleben, 11, 17\r\n\r\nGlasenapps _Life of Wagner_, 8, 16, 19, 39, 66, 167\r\n\r\nGluck, 416, 417;\r\n his _Iphigenia in Aulis_ overture revised by Wagner, 209, 219\r\n\r\nGoethe, J.W.  von, _Die Laune des Verliebten_, 35\r\n\r\nGötterdämmerung. _See_ Dusk of the Gods\r\n\r\nGottfried von Strassburg, _Tristan_, 238\r\n\r\nGozzi, _La Donna Serpente_, 60\r\n\r\n\r\nHabeneck, F.A., 69, 70\r\n\r\nHallé, Sir Charles, 64, 73, 327\r\n\r\nHandel, G.F., 11, 330, 331, 390, 416;\r\n the \"Horse and his Rider\" chorus, 371, 372;\r\n _Israel in Egypt_, 377\r\n\r\nHanslick, Eduard, 164\r\n\r\n_Happy Evening, A_, 213\r\n\r\nHarris, Sir Augustus, 346\r\n\r\nHauser, Franz, 49\r\n\r\nHeine, Heinrich, 64, 66, 70, 76-78, 94, 126, 205, 206\r\n\r\nHeubner, Otto, 196\r\n\r\n_Hochzeit Die_, 45, 47\r\n\r\nHoffmann, E.T.A., 30\r\n\r\n_Huldigungsmarsch_, 59\r\n\r\n\r\nJensen, Adolf, 71, 418\r\n\r\n_Jesus of Nazareth_, 196\r\n\r\nJews, Wagner and the, 49, 50, 57, 217-219\r\n\r\nJoly, Anténor, 69, 74\r\n\r\n_Judaism in Music_, 31, 50, 134, 217-219\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kaisermarsch_, 59\r\n\r\nKittl, Friedrich, 45\r\n\r\n\r\nLaube, Heinrich, 51, 70\r\n\r\nLehrs, F.
