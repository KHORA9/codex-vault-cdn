I have, therefore, added an appendix dealing with\r\ncertain criticisms based upon the nature of the first Balkan War, in the\r\ncourse of which I attempt to show just how the principles elaborated\r\nhere have been working out in European politics.\r\n\r\nThat American interest in the problems here discussed is hardly less\r\nvital than that of Europe I am even more persuaded than when the first\r\nAmerican edition of this book was issued in 1910. It is certain that\r\nopinion in America will not be equipped for dealing with her own\r\nproblems arising out of her relations with the Spanish American states,\r\nwith Japan, with the Philippines, unless it has some fair understanding\r\nof the principles with which this book deals. Its general interest even\r\ngoes farther than this: no great community like that of modern America\r\ncan remain indifferent to the drift of general opinion throughout the\r\nworld on matters wrapped up with issues so important as those of war and\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThat the tangible commercial and business interests of America are\r\ninvolved in these European events is obvious from the very factors of\r\nfinancial and commercial interdependence which form the basis of the\r\nargument.\r\n\r\nThat the interests of Americans are inextricably, if indirectly, bound\r\nup with those of Europe, has become increasingly clear as can be proved\r\nby the barest investigation of the trend of political thought in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe thesis on its economic side is discussed in terms of the gravest\r\nproblem which now faces European statesmanship, but these terms are also\r\nthe living symbols of a principle of universal application, as true with\r\nreference to American conditions as to European. If I have not\r\n\"localized\" the discussion by using illustrations drawn from purely\r\nAmerican cases, it is because these problems have not at present, in the\r\nUnited States, reached the acute stage that they have in Europe, and\r\nillustrations drawn from the conditions of an actual and pressing\r\nproblem give to any discussion a reality which to some extent it might\r\nlose if discussed on the basis of more supposititious cases.\r\n\r\nIt so happens, however, that in the more abstract section of the\r\ndiscussion embraced in the second part, which I have termed the \"Human\r\nNature of the Case,\" I have gone mainly to American authors for the\r\nstatement of cases based on those illusions with which the book deals.\r\n\r\nFor this edition I have thought it worth while thoroughly to revise the\r\nwhole of the book and to re-write the chapter on the payment of the\r\nFrench Indemnity, in order to clear up a misunderstanding to which in\r\nits first form it gave rise. Part III has also been re-written, in order\r\nto meet the changed form of criticism which has resulted from the\r\ndiscussion of this subject during the last year or two.\r\n\r\nIt is with very great regret that I have seen this book grow in bulk;\r\nbut as it constitutes the statement of a thesis still revolutionary, it\r\nhas to cover the whole ground of the discussion, sometimes in great\r\ndetail. I have, however, adopted an arrangement and method of\r\npresentation by which, I trust, the increase in bulk will not render it\r\nless clear. The general arrangement is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Synopsis is a very brief indication of the scope of the whole\r\nargument, which is not that war is impossible, but that it is\r\nfutile--useless, even when completely victorious, as a means of securing\r\nthose moral or material ends which represent the needs of modern\r\ncivilized peoples; and that on a general realization of this truth\r\ndepends the solution of the problem of armaments and warfare.\r\n\r\nThe general economic argument is summarized in Chapter III., Part I.\r\n\r\nThe moral, psychological, and biological argument is summarized in\r\nChapter II., Part II.\r\n\r\nThe practical outcome--what should be our policy with reference to\r\ndefence, why progress depends upon the improvement of public opinion and\r\nthe best general methods of securing that--is discussed in Part III.\r\n\r\nThis method of treatment has involved some small repetition of fact\r\nand illustration, but the repetition is trifling in bulk--it does not\r\namount in all to the value of more than three or four pages--and I have\r\nbeen more concerned to make the matter in hand clear to the reader than\r\nto observe all the literary canons. I may add that, apart from this, the\r\nprocess of condensation has been carried to its extreme limit for the\r\ncharacter of data dealt with, and that those who desire to understand\r\nthoroughly the significance of the thesis with which the book deals--it\r\nis worth understanding--had really better read every line of it!\r\n\r\nOne personal word may perhaps be excused as explaining certain\r\nphraseology, which would seem to indicate that the author is of English\r\nnationality. He happens to be of English birth, but to have passed his\r\nyouth and early manhood in the United States, having acquired American\r\ncitizenship there. This I hope entitles him to use the collective \"we\"\r\non both sides of the Atlantic. I may add that the last fifteen years\r\nhave been passed mainly in Europe studying at first hand the problems\r\nhere dealt with.\r\n\r\n                                                                N.A.\r\n  LONDON, October, 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present volume is the outcome of a large pamphlet published in\r\nEurope at the end of last year entitled _Europe's Optical Illusion_. The\r\ninterest that the pamphlet created and the character of the discussion\r\nprovoked throughout Europe persuaded me that its subject-matter was\r\nworth fuller and more detailed treatment than then given it. Herewith\r\nthe result of that conviction. The thesis on its economic side is\r\ndiscussed in the terms of the gravest problem which now faces European\r\nstatesmanship, but these terms are also the living symbols of a\r\nprinciple of universal application, as true with reference to American\r\nconditions as to European. If I have not \"localized\" the discussion by\r\nusing illustrations drawn from purely American cases, it is because\r\nthese problems have not at present in the United States reached the\r\nacute stage that they have in Europe, and illustrations drawn from the\r\nconditions of an actual and pressing problem give to any discussion a\r\nreality which to some extent it might lose if discussed on the basis of\r\nmore suppositious cases.\r\n\r\nIt so happens, however, that in the more abstract section of the\r\ndiscussion embraced in the second part, which I have termed the \"Human\r\nNature of the Case,\" I have gone mainly to American authors for the\r\nstatement of cases based on those illusions with which the book deals.\r\n\r\n                                                                N.A.\r\n  PARIS, August, 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the fundamental motives that explain the present rivalry of\r\narmaments in Europe, notably the Anglo-German? Each nation pleads the\r\nneed for defence; but this implies that someone is likely to attack, and\r\nhas therefore a presumed interest in so doing. What are the motives\r\nwhich each State thus fears its neighbors may obey?\r\n\r\nThey are based on the universal assumption that a nation, in order to\r\nfind outlets for expanding population and increasing industry, or simply\r\nto ensure the best conditions possible for its people, is necessarily\r\npushed to territorial expansion and the exercise of political force\r\nagainst others (German naval competition is assumed to be the expression\r\nof the growing need of an expanding population for a larger place in the\r\nworld, a need which will find a realization in the conquest of English\r\nColonies or trade, unless these are defended); it is assumed, therefore,\r\nthat a nation's relative prosperity is broadly determined by its\r\npolitical power; that nations being competing units, advantage, in the\r\nlast resort, goes to the possessor of preponderant military force, the\r\nweaker going to the wall, as in the other forms of the struggle for\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe author challenges this whole doctrine. He attempts to show that it\r\nbelongs to a stage of development out of which we have passed; that the\r\ncommerce and industry of a people no longer depend upon the expansion of\r\nits political frontiers; that a nation's political and economic\r\nfrontiers do not now necessarily coincide; that military power is\r\nsocially and economically futile, and can have no relation to the\r\nprosperity of the people exercising it; that it is impossible for one\r\nnation to seize by force the wealth or trade of another--to enrich\r\nitself by subjugating, or imposing its will by force on another; that,\r\nin short, war, even when victorious, can no longer achieve those aims\r\nfor which peoples strive.\r\n\r\nHe establishes this apparent paradox, in so far as the economic problem\r\nis concerned, by showing that wealth in the economically civilized world\r\nis founded upon credit and commercial contract (these being the\r\noutgrowth of an economic interdependence due to the increasing division\r\nof labor and greatly developed communication). If credit and commercial\r\ncontract are tampered with in an attempt at confiscation, the\r\ncredit-dependent wealth is undermined, and its collapse involves that of\r\nthe conqueror; so that if conquest is not to be self-injurious it must\r\nrespect the enemy's property, in which case it becomes economically\r\nfutile. Thus the wealth of conquered territory remains in the hands of\r\nthe population of such territory. When Germany annexed Alsatia, no\r\nindividual German secured a single mark's worth of Alsatian property as\r\nthe spoils of war. Conquest in the modern world is a process of\r\nmultiplying by _x_, and then obtaining the original figure by dividing\r\nby _x_. For a modern nation to add to its territory no more adds to the\r\nwealth of the people of such nation than it would add to the wealth of\r\nLondoners if the City of London were to annex the county of Hertford.\r\n\r\nThe author also shows that international finance has become so\r\ninterdependent and so interwoven with trade and industry that the\r\nintangibility of an enemy's property extends to his trade. It results\r\nthat political and military power can in reality do nothing for trade;\r\nthe individual merchants and manufacturers of small nations, exercising\r\nno such power, compete successfully with those of the great. Swiss and\r\nBelgian merchants drive English from the British Colonial market; Norway\r\nhas, relatively to population, a greater mercantile marine than Great\r\nBritain; the public credit (as a rough-and-ready indication, among\r\nothers, of security and wealth) of small States possessing no political\r\npower often stands higher than that of the Great Powers of Europe,\r\nBelgian Three per Cents. standing at 96, and German at 82; Norwegian\r\nThree and a Half per Cents. at 102, and Russian Three and a Half per\r\nCents. at 81.\r\n\r\nThe forces which have brought about the economic futility of military\r\npower have also rendered it futile as a means of enforcing a nation's\r\nmoral ideals or imposing social institutions upon a conquered people.\r\nGermany could not turn Canada or Australia into German colonies--_i.e._,\r\nstamp out their language, law, literature, traditions, etc.--by\r\n\"capturing\" them. The necessary security in their material possessions\r\nenjoyed by the inhabitants of such conquered provinces, quick\r\ninter-communication by a cheap press, widely-read literature, enable\r\neven small communities to become articulate and effectively to defend\r\ntheir special social or moral possessions, even when military conquest\r\nhas been complete. The fight for ideals can no longer take the form of\r\nfight between nations, because the lines of division on moral questions\r\nare within the nations themselves and intersect the political frontiers.\r\nThere is no modern State which is completely Catholic or Protestant, or\r\nliberal or autocratic, or aristocratic or democratic, or socialist or\r\nindividualist; the moral and spiritual struggles of the modern world go\r\non between citizens of the same State in unconscious intellectual\r\nco-operation with corresponding groups in other States, not between the\r\npublic powers of rival States.\r\n\r\nThis classification by strata involves necessarily a redirection of\r\nhuman pugnacity, based rather on the rivalry of classes and interests\r\nthan on State divisions. War has no longer the justification that it\r\nmakes for the survival of the fittest; it involves the survival of the\r\nless fit. The idea that the struggle between nations is a part of the\r\nevolutionary law of man's advance involves a profound misreading of the\r\nbiological analogy.\r\n\r\nThe warlike nations do not inherit the earth; they represent the\r\ndecaying human element. The diminishing role of physical force in all\r\nspheres of human activity carries with it profound psychological\r\nmodifications.\r\n\r\nThese tendencies, mainly the outcome of purely modern conditions (_e.g._\r\nrapidity of communication), have rendered the problems of modern\r\ninternational politics profoundly and essentially different from the\r\nancient; yet our ideas are still dominated by the principles and axioms,\r\nimages and terminology of the bygone days.\r\n\r\nThe author urges that these little-recognized facts may be utilized for\r\nthe solution of the armament difficulty on at present untried lines--by\r\nsuch modification of opinion in Europe that much of the present motive\r\nto aggression will cease to be operative, and by thus diminishing the\r\nrisk of attack, diminishing to the same extent the need for defence. He\r\nshows how such a political reformation is within the scope of practical\r\npolitics, and the methods which should be employed to bring it about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nTHE ECONOMICS OF THE CASE\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER                                                   PAGE\r\n     I.

end?--Why peace\r\n    advocacy fails--Why it deserves to fail--The attitude of the peace\r\n    advocate--The presumption that the prosperity of nations depends\r\n    upon their political power, and consequent necessity of protection\r\n    against aggression of other nations who would diminish our power\r\n    to their advantage--These the universal axioms of international\r\n    politics.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is generally admitted that the present rivalry in armaments in\r\nEurope--notably such as that now in progress between England and\r\nGermany--cannot go on in its present form indefinitely. The net result\r\nof each side meeting the efforts of the other with similar efforts is\r\nthat at the end of a given period the relative position of each is what\r\nit was originally, and the enormous sacrifices of both have gone for\r\nnothing. If as between England and Germany it is claimed that England is\r\nin a position to maintain the lead because she has the money, Germany\r\ncan retort that she is in a position to maintain the lead because she\r\nhas the population, which must, in the case of a highly organized\r\nEuropean nation, in the end mean money. Meanwhile, neither side can\r\nyield to the other, as the one so doing would, it is felt, be placed at\r\nthe mercy of the other, a situation which neither will accept.\r\n\r\nThere are two current solutions which are offered as a means of egress\r\nfrom this _impasse_. There is that of the smaller party, regarded in\r\nboth countries for the most part as one of dreamers and doctrinaires,\r\nwho hope to solve the problem by a resort to general disarmament, or, at\r\nleast, a limitation of armament by agreement. And there is that of the\r\nlarger, which is esteemed the more practical party, of those who are\r\npersuaded that the present state of rivalry and recurrent irritation is\r\nbound to culminate in an armed conflict, which, by definitely reducing\r\none or other of the parties to a position of manifest inferiority, will\r\nsettle the thing for at least some time, until after a longer or shorter\r\nperiod a state of relative equilibrium is established, and the whole\r\nprocess will be recommenced _da capo_.\r\n\r\nThis second solution is, on the whole, accepted as one of the laws of\r\nlife: one of the hard facts of existence which men of ordinary courage\r\ntake as all in the day's work. And in every country those favoring the\r\nother solution are looked upon either as people who fail to realize the\r\nhard facts of the world in which they live, or as people less concerned\r\nwith the security of their country than with upholding a somewhat\r\nemasculate ideal; ready to weaken the defences of their own country on\r\nno better assurance than that the prospective enemy will not be so\r\nwicked as to attack them.\r\n\r\nTo this the virile man is apt to oppose the law of conflict. Most of\r\nwhat the nineteenth century has taught us of the evolution of life on\r\nthe planet is pressed into the service of this struggle-for-life\r\nphilosophy. We are reminded of the survival of the fittest, that the\r\nweakest go to the wall, and that all life, sentient and non-sentient, is\r\nbut a life of battle. The sacrifice involved in armament is the price\r\nwhich nations pay for their safety and for their political power. The\r\npower of England has been the main condition of her past industrial\r\nsuccess; her trade has been extensive and her merchants rich, because\r\nshe has been able to make her political and military force felt, and to\r\nexercise her influence among all the nations of the world. If she has\r\ndominated the commerce of the world, it is because her unconquered navy\r\nhas dominated, and continues to dominate, all the avenues of commerce.\r\nThis is the currently accepted argument.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Germany has of late come to the front as an industrial\r\nnation, making giant strides in general prosperity and well-being, is\r\ndeemed also to be the result of _her_ military successes and the\r\nincreasing political power which she is coming to exercise in\r\nContinental Europe. These things, alike in England and in Germany, are\r\naccepted as the axioms of the problem, as the citations given in the\r\nnext chapter sufficiently prove. I am not aware that a single authority\r\nof note, at least in the world of workaday politics, has ever challenged\r\nor disputed them. Even those who have occupied prominent positions in\r\nthe propaganda of peace are at one with the veriest fire-eaters on this\r\npoint. Mr. W.T. Stead was one of the leaders of the big navy party in\r\nEngland. Mr. Frederic Harrison, who all his life had been known as the\r\nphilosopher protagonist of peace, declared recently that, if England\r\nallowed Germany to get ahead of her in the race for armaments, \"famine,\r\nsocial anarchy, incalculable chaos in the industrial and financial\r\nworld, would be the inevitable result. Britain may live on ... but\r\nbefore she began to live freely again she would have to lose half her\r\npopulation, which she could not feed, and all her overseas Empire, which\r\nshe could not defend.... How idle are fine words about retrenchment,\r\npeace, and brotherhood, whilst we lie open to the risk of unutterable\r\nruin, to a deadly fight for national existence, to war in its most\r\ndestructive and cruel form.\" On the other side we have friendly critics\r\nof England, like Professor von Schulze-Gaevernitz, writing: \"We want our\r\n[_i.e._ Germany's] navy in order to confine the commercial rivalry of\r\nEngland within innocuous limits, and to deter the sober sense of the\r\nEnglish people from the extremely threatening thought of attack upon\r\nus.... The German navy is a condition of our bare existence and\r\nindependence, like the daily bread on which we depend not only for\r\nourselves, but for our children.\"\r\n\r\nConfronted by a situation of this sort, one is bound to feel that the\r\nordinary argument of the pacifist entirely breaks down; and it breaks\r\ndown for a very simple reason. He himself accepts the premise which has\r\njust been indicated--viz., that the victorious party in the struggle for\r\npolitical predominance gains some material advantage over the party\r\nwhich is conquered. The proposition even to the pacifist seems so\r\nself-evident that he makes no effort to combat it. He pleads his case\r\notherwise. \"It cannot be denied, of course,\" says one peace advocate,\r\n\"that the thief _does_ secure some material advantage by his theft. What\r\nwe plead is that if the two parties were to devote to honest labor the\r\ntime and energy devoted to preying upon each other, the permanent gain\r\nwould more than offset the occasional booty.\"\r\n\r\nSome pacifists go further, and take the ground that there is a conflict\r\nbetween the natural law and the moral law, and that we must choose the\r\nmoral even to our hurt. Thus Mr. Edward Grubb writes:\r\n\r\n     Self-preservation is not the final law for nations any more\r\n     than for individuals.... The progress of humanity may demand\r\n     the extinction (in this world) of the individual, and it may\r\n     demand also the example and the inspiration of a martyr nation.\r\n     So long as the Divine providence has need of us, Christian\r\n     faith requires that we shall trust for our safety to the unseen\r\n     but real forces of right dealing, truthfulness, and love; but,\r\n     should the will of God demand it, we must be prepared, as\r\n     Jeremiah taught his nation long ago, to give up even our\r\n     national life for furthering those great ends \"to which the\r\n     whole creation moves.\"\r\n\r\n     This may be \"fanaticism,\" but, if so, it is the fanaticism of\r\n     Christ and of the prophets, and we are willing to take our\r\n     places along with them.[1]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is really the keynote of much pacifist propaganda. In our\r\nown day, Count Tolstoi has even expressed anger at the suggestion that\r\nany reaction against militarism, on other than moral grounds, can be\r\nefficacious.\r\n\r\nThe peace advocate pleads for \"altruism\" in international relationships,\r\nand in so doing admits that successful war may be to the interest,\r\nthough the immoral interest, of the victorious party. That is why the\r\n\"inhumanity\" of war bulks so largely in his propaganda, and why he\r\ndwells so much upon its horrors and cruelties.\r\n\r\nIt thus results that the workaday world and those engaged in the rough\r\nand tumble of practical politics have come to look upon the peace ideal\r\nas a counsel of perfection, which may one day be attained when human\r\nnature, as the common phrase is, has been improved out of existence, but\r\nnot while human nature remains what it is. While it remains possible to\r\nseize a tangible advantage by a man's strong right arm the advantage\r\nwill be seized, and woe betide the man who cannot defend himself.\r\n\r\nNor is this philosophy of force either as conscienceless, as brutal, or\r\nas ruthless as its common statement would make it appear. We know that\r\nin the world as it exists to-day, in spheres other than those of\r\ninternational rivalry, the race is to the strong, and the weak get\r\nscant consideration. Industrialism and commercialism are as full of\r\ncruelties as war itself--cruelties, indeed, that are longer drawn out,\r\nmore refined, though less apparent, and, it may be, appealing less to\r\nthe common imagination than those of war. With whatever reticence we may\r\nput the philosophy into words, we all feel that conflict of interests in\r\nthis world is inevitable, and that what is an incident of our daily\r\nlives should not be shirked as a condition of those occasional titanic\r\nconflicts which mould the history of the world.\r\n\r\nThe virile man doubts whether he ought to be moved by the plea of the\r\n\"inhumanity\" of war. The masculine mind accepts suffering, death itself,\r\nas a risk which we are all prepared to run even in the most unheroic\r\nforms of money-making; none of us refuses to use the railway train\r\nbecause of the occasional smash, to travel because of the occasional\r\nshipwreck, and so on. Indeed, peaceful industry demands a heavier toll\r\neven in blood than does a war, fact which the casualty statistics in\r\nrailroading, fishing, mining and seamanship, eloquently attest; while\r\nsuch peaceful industries as fishing and shipping are the cause of as\r\nmuch brutality.[2] The peaceful administration of the tropics takes as\r\nheavy a toll in the health and lives of good men, and much of it, as in\r\nthe West of Africa, involves, unhappily, a moral deterioration of human\r\ncharacter as great as that which can be put to the account of war.\r\n\r\nBeside these peace sacrifices the \"price of war\" is trivial, and it is\r\nfelt that the trustees of a nation's interests ought not to shrink from\r\npaying that price should the efficient protection of those interests\r\ndemand it. If the common man is prepared, as we know he is, to risk his\r\nlife in a dozen dangerous trades and professions for no object higher\r\nthan that of improving his position or increasing his income, why should\r\nthe statesman shrink from such sacrifices as the average war demands, if\r\nthereby the great interests which have been confided to him can be\r\nadvanced? If it be true, as even the pacifist admits that it may be\r\ntrue, that the tangible material interests of a nation can be advanced\r\nby warfare; if, in other words, warfare can play some large part in the\r\nprotection of the interests of humanity, the rulers of a courageous\r\npeople are justified in disregarding the suffering and the sacrifice\r\nthat it may involve.\r\n\r\nOf course, the pacifist falls back upon the moral plea: we have no\r\nright to take by force. But here again the common sense of ordinary\r\nhumanity does not follow the peace advocate. If the individual\r\nmanufacturer is entitled to use all the advantages which great financial\r\nand industrial resources may give him against a less powerful\r\ncompetitor, if he is entitled, as under our present industrial scheme he\r\nis entitled, to overcome competition by a costly and perfected\r\norganization of manufacture, of advertisement, of salesmanship, in a\r\ntrade in which poorer men gain their livelihood, why should not the\r\nnation be entitled to overcome the rivalry of other nations by utilizing\r\nthe force of its public services? It is a commonplace of industrial\r\ncompetition that the \"big man\" takes advantage of _all_ the weaknesses\r\nof the small man--his narrow means, his ill-health even--to undermine\r\nand to undersell. If it were true that industrial competition were\r\nalways merciful, and national or political competition always cruel, the\r\nplea of the peace man might be unanswerable; but we know, as a matter of\r\nfact, that this is not the case, and, returning to our starting-point,\r\nthe common man feels that he is obliged to accept the world as he finds\r\nit, that struggle and warfare, in one form or another, are among the\r\nconditions of life, conditions which he did not make. Moreover he is not\r\nat all sure that the warfare of arms is necessarily either the hardest\r\nor the most cruel form of that struggle which exists throughout the\r\nuniverse. In any case, he is willing to take the risks, because he feels\r\nthat military predominance gives him a real and tangible advantage, a\r\nmaterial advantage translatable into terms of general social well-being,\r\nby enlarged commercial opportunities, wider markets, protection against\r\nthe aggression of commercial rivals, and so on. He faces the risk of war\r\nin the same spirit as that in which a sailor or a fisherman faces the\r\nrisk of drowning, or a miner that of the choke damp, or a doctor that of\r\na fatal disease, because he would rather take the supreme risk than\r\naccept for himself and his dependents a lower situation, a narrower and\r\nmeaner existence, with complete safety. He also asks whether the lower\r\npath is altogether free from risks. If he knows much of life he knows\r\nthat in very many circumstances the bolder way is the safer way.\r\n\r\nThat is why it is that the peace propaganda has so signally failed, and\r\nwhy the public opinion of the countries of Europe, far from restraining\r\nthe tendency of their Governments to increase armaments, is pushing them\r\ninto still greater expenditure. It is universally assumed that national\r\npower means national wealth, national advantage; that expanding\r\nterritory means increased opportunity for industry; that the strong\r\nnation can guarantee opportunities for its citizens that the weak nation\r\ncannot. The Englishman, for instance, believes that his wealth is\r\nlargely the result of his political power, of his political domination,\r\nmainly of his sea power; that Germany with her expanding population must\r\nfeel cramped; that she must fight for elbow-room; and that if he does\r\nnot defend himself he will illustrate that universal law which makes of\r\nevery stomach a graveyard. He has a natural preference for being the\r\ndiner rather than the dinner. As it is universally admitted that wealth\r\nand prosperity and well-being go with strength and power and national\r\ngreatness, he intends, so long as he is able, to maintain that strength\r\nand power and greatness, and not to yield it even in the name of\r\naltruism. And he will not yield it, because should he do so it would be\r\nsimply to replace British power and greatness by the power and greatness\r\nof some other nation, which he feels sure would do no more for the\r\nwell-being of civilization as a whole than he is prepared to do. He is\r\npersuaded that he can no more yield in the competition of armaments,\r\nthan as a business man or as a manufacturer he could yield in commercial\r\ncompetition to his rival; that he must fight out his salvation under\r\nconditions as he finds them, since he did not make them, and since he\r\ncannot change them.\r\n\r\nAdmitting his premises--and these premises are the universally accepted\r\naxioms of international politics the world over--who shall say that he\r\nis wrong?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE AXIOMS OF MODERN STATECRAFT\r\n\r\n    Are the foregoing axioms unchallengeable?--Some typical statements\r\n    of them--German dreams of conquest--Mr. Frederic Harrison on\r\n    results of defeat of British arms and invasion of England--Forty\r\n    millions starving.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre the axioms set out in the last chapter unchallengeable?\r\n\r\nIs it true that the wealth, prosperity and well-being of a nation depend\r\nupon its military power, or have necessarily anything whatever to do\r\ntherewith?\r\n\r\nCan one civilized nation gain moral or material advantage by the\r\nmilitary conquest of another?\r\n\r\nDoes conquered territory add to the wealth of the conquering nation?\r\n\r\nIs it possible for a nation to \"own\" the territory of another in the way\r\nthat a person or corporation would \"own\" an estate?\r\n\r\nCould Germany \"take\" English trade and Colonies by military force?\r\n\r\nCould she turn English Colonies into German ones, and win an overseas\r\nempire by the sword, as England won hers in the past?\r\n\r\nDoes a modern nation need to expand its political boundaries in order\r\nto provide for increasing population?\r\n\r\nIf England could conquer Germany to-morrow, completely conquer her,\r\nreduce her nationality to so much dust, would the ordinary British\r\nsubject be the better for it?\r\n\r\nIf Germany could conquer England, would any ordinary German subject be\r\nthe better for it?\r\n\r\nThe fact that all these questions have to be answered in the negative,\r\nand that a negative answer seems to outrage common sense, shows how much\r\nour political axioms are in need of revision.\r\n\r\nThe literature on the subject leaves no doubt whatever that I have\r\ncorrectly stated the premises of the matter in the foregoing chapter.\r\nThose whose special vocation is the philosophy of statecraft in the\r\ninternational field, from Aristotle and Plato, passing by Machiavelli\r\nand Clausewitz down to Mr. Roosevelt and the German Emperor, have left\r\nus in no doubt whatever on the point. The whole view has been admirably\r\nsummarized by two notable writers--Admiral Mahan, on the Anglo-Saxon\r\nside, and Baron Karl von Stengel (second German delegate to the First\r\nHague Conference) on the German. Admiral Mahan says:\r\n\r\n     The old predatory instinct that he should take who has the\r\n     power survives ... and moral force is not sufficient to\r\n     determine issues unless supported by physical. Governments are\r\n     corporations, and corporations have no souls; governments,\r\n     moreover, are trustees, and as such must put first the lawful\r\n     interests of their wards--their own people.... More and more\r\n     Germany needs the assured importation of raw materials, and,\r\n     where possible, control of regions productive of such\r\n     materials. More and more she requires assured markets and\r\n     security as to the importation of food, since less and less\r\n     comparatively is produced within her own borders by her rapidly\r\n     increasing population. This all means security at sea.... Yet\r\n     the supremacy of Great Britain in European seas means a\r\n     perpetually latent control of German commerce.... The world has\r\n     long been accustomed to the idea of a predominant naval power,\r\n     coupling it with the name of Great Britain, and it has been\r\n     noted that such power, when achieved, is commonly often\r\n     associated with commercial and industrial predominance, the\r\n     struggle for which is now in progress between Great Britain and\r\n     Germany. Such predominance forces a nation to seek markets,\r\n     and, where possible, to control them to its own advantage by\r\n     preponderant force, the ultimate expression of which is\r\n     possession.... From this flow two results: the attempt to\r\n     possess and the organization of force by which to maintain\r\n     possession already achieved.... This statement is simply a\r\n     specific formulation of the general necessity stated; it is an\r\n     inevitable link in the chain of logical sequences--industrial\r\n     markets, control, navy bases....[3]\r\n\r\nBut in order to show that this is no special view, and that this\r\nphilosophy does indeed represent the general public opinion of Europe,\r\nthe opinion of the great mass which prompts the actions of Governments\r\nand explains their respective policies, I take the following from the\r\ncurrent newspapers and reviews ready to my hand:\r\n\r\n     It is the prowess of our navy ... our dominant position\r\n     at sea ... which has built up the British Empire and its\r\n     commerce.--London _Times_ leading article.\r\n\r\n     Because her commerce is infinitely vulnerable, and because her\r\n     people are dependent upon that commerce for food and the wages\r\n     with which to buy it.... Britain wants a powerful fleet, a\r\n     perfect organization behind the fleet, and an army of defence.\r\n     Until they are provided this country will exist under perpetual\r\n     menace from the growing fleet of German _Dreadnoughts_, which\r\n     have made the North Sea their parade-ground. All security will\r\n     disappear, and British commerce and industry, when no man knows\r\n     what the morrow will bring forth, must rapidly decline, thus\r\n     accentuating British national degeneracy and decadence.--H.W.\r\n     Wilson in the _National Review_, May, 1909.\r\n\r\n     Sea-power is the last fact which stands between Germany and the\r\n     supreme position in international commerce. At present Germany\r\n     sends only some fifty million pounds worth, or about a seventh,\r\n     of her total domestic produce to the markets of the world\r\n     outside Europe and the United States.... Does any man who\r\n     understands the subject think there is any power in Germany,\r\n     or, indeed, any power in the world, which can prevent Germany,\r\n     she having thus accomplished the first stage of her work, from\r\n     now closing with Great Britain for her ultimate share of this\r\n     240 millions of overseas trade? Here it is that we unmask the\r\n     shadow which looms like a real presence behind all the moves of\r\n     present-day diplomacy, and behind all the colossal armaments\r\n     that indicate the present preparations for a new struggle for\r\n     sea-power.--Mr. Benjamin Kidd in the _Fortnightly Review_,\r\n     April 1, 1910.\r\n\r\n     It is idle to talk of \"limitation of armaments\" unless the\r\n     nations of the earth will unanimously consent to lay aside all\r\n     selfish ambitions.... Nations, like individuals, concern\r\n     themselves chiefly with their own interests, and when these\r\n     clash with those of others, quarrels are apt to follow. If the\r\n     aggrieved party is the weaker he usually goes to the wall,\r\n     though \"right\" be never so much on his side; and the stronger,\r\n     whether he be the aggressor or not, usually has his own way. In\r\n     international politics charity begins at home, and quite\r\n     properly; the duty of a statesman is to think first of the\r\n     interests of his own country.--_United Service Magazine_, May,\r\n     1909.\r\n\r\n     Why should Germany attack Britain? Because Germany and Britain\r\n     are commercial and political rivals; because Germany covets\r\n     the trade, the colonies, and the Empire which Britain now\r\n     possesses.--Robert Blatchford, \"Germany and England,\" p. 4.\r\n\r\n     Great Britain, with her present population, exists by virtue of\r\n     her foreign trade and her control of the carrying trade of the\r\n     world; defeat in war would mean the transference of both to\r\n     other hands and consequent starvation for a large percentage of\r\n     the wage-earners.--T.G. Martin in the London _World_.\r\n\r\n     We offer an enormously rich prize if we are not able to defend\r\n     out shores; we may be perfectly certain that the prize which we\r\n     offer will go into the mouth of somebody powerful enough to\r\n     overcome our resistance and to swallow a considerable portion\r\n     of us up.--The Speaker of the House of Commons in a speech at\r\n     Greystoke, reported by the London _Times_.\r\n\r\n     What is good for the beehive is good for the bee. Whatever\r\n     brings rich lands, new ports, or wealthy industrial areas to a\r\n     State enriches its treasury, and therefore the nation at large,\r\n     and therefore the individual.--Mr. Douglas Owen in a letter to\r\n     the _Economist_, May 28, 1910.\r\n\r\n     Do not forget that in war there is no such thing as\r\n     international law, and that undefended wealth will be seized\r\n     wherever it is exposed, whether through the broken pane of a\r\n     jeweller's window or owing to the obsession of a humanitarian\r\n     Celt.--London _Referee_, November 14, 1909.\r\n\r\n     We appear to have forgotten the fundamental truth--confirmed by\r\n     all history--that the warlike races inherit the earth, and that\r\n     Nature decrees the survival of the fittest in the never-ending\r\n     struggle for existence.... Our yearning for disarmament, our\r\n     respect for the tender plant of Non-conformist conscience, and\r\n     the parrot-like repetition of the misleading formula that the\r\n     \"greatest of all British interests is peace\" ... must\r\n     inevitably give to any people who covet our wealth and our\r\n     possessions ... the ambition to strike a swift and deadly blow\r\n     at the heart of the Empire--undefended London.--_Blackwood's\r\n     Magazine_, May, 1909.\r\n\r\nThese are taken from English sources, but there is not a straw to choose\r\nbetween them and other European opinion on the subject.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Mahan and the other Anglo-Saxons of his school have their\r\ncounterpart in every European country, but more especially in Germany.\r\nEven so \"Liberal\" a statesman as Baron Karl von Stengel, the German\r\ndelegate to the First Hague Peace Conference, lays it down in his book\r\nthat--\r\n\r\n     Every great Power must employ its efforts towards exercising\r\n     the largest influence possible, not only in European but in\r\n     world politics, and this mainly because economic power depends\r\n     in the last resort on political power, and because the largest\r\n     participation possible in the trade of the world is a vital\r\n     question for every nation.\r\n\r\nThe writings of such classic authorities as Clausewitz give full\r\nconfirmation of this view, while it is the resounding note of most\r\npopular German political literature that deals with \"Weltpolitik.\" Grand\r\nAdmiral von Koster, President of the Navy League, writes:\r\n\r\n     The steady increase of our population compels us to devote\r\n     special attention to the growth of our overseas interests.\r\n     Nothing but the strong fulfilment of our naval programme can\r\n     create for us that importance upon the free-world-sea which it\r\n     is incumbent upon us to demand. The steady increase of our\r\n     population compels us to set ourselves new goals and to grow\r\n     from a Continental into a world power. Our mighty industry must\r\n     aspire to new overseas conquests. Our world trade--which has\r\n     more than doubled in twenty years, which has increased from\r\n     2500 million dollars to 4000 million dollars during the ten\r\n     years in which our naval programme was fixed, and 3000 million\r\n     dollars of which is sea-borne commerce--only can flourish if we\r\n     continue honorably to bear the burdens of our armaments on\r\n     land and sea alike. Unless our children are to accuse us of\r\n     short-sightedness, it is now our duty to secure our world power\r\n     and position among other nations. We can do that only under the\r\n     protection of a strong German fleet, a fleet which shall\r\n     guarantee us peace with honor for the distant future.\r\n\r\nOne popular German writer sees the possibility of \"overthrowing the\r\nBritish Empire\" and \"wiping it from the map of the world in less than\r\ntwenty-four hours.\" (I quote his actual words, and I have heard a\r\nparallel utterance from the mouth of a serious English public man.) The\r\nauthor in question, in order to show how the thing could come about,\r\ndeals with the matter prophetically. Writing from the standpoint of\r\n1911,[4] he admits that--\r\n\r\n     At the beginning of the twentieth century Great Britain was a\r\n     free, a rich, and a happy country, in which every citizen, from\r\n     the Prime Minister to the dock-laborer, was proud to be a\r\n     member of the world-ruling nation. At the head of the State\r\n     were men possessing a general mandate to carry out their\r\n     programme of government, whose actions were subject to the\r\n     criticism of public opinion, represented by an independent\r\n     Press. Educated for centuries in self-government, a race had\r\n     grown up which seemed born to rule. The highest triumphs\r\n     attended England's skill in the art of government, in her\r\n     handling of subject peoples.... And this immense Empire, which\r\n     stretched from the Cape to Cairo, over the southern half of\r\n     Asia, over half of North America and the fifth continent, could\r\n     be wiped from the map of the world in less than twenty-four\r\n     hours! This apparently inexplicable fact will be intelligible\r\n     if we keep in sight the circumstances which rendered possible\r\n     the building up of England's colonial power. The true basis of\r\n     her world supremacy was not her own strength, but the maritime\r\n     weakness of all the other European nations. Their almost\r\n     complete lack of naval preparations had given the English a\r\n     position of monopoly which was used by them for the annexation\r\n     of all those dominions which seemed of value. Had it been in\r\n     England's power to keep the rest of the world as it was in the\r\n     nineteenth century, the British Empire might have continued for\r\n     an unlimited time. The awakening of the Continental States to\r\n     their national possibilities and to political independence\r\n     introduced quite new factors into Weltpolitik, and it was only\r\n     a question of time as to how long England could maintain her\r\n     position in the face of the changed circumstances.\r\n\r\nAnd the writer tells how the trick was done, thanks to a fog, efficient\r\nespionage, the bursting of the English war balloon, and the success of\r\nthe German one in dropping shells at the correct tactical moment on to\r\nthe British ships in the North Sea:\r\n\r\n     This war, which was decided by a naval battle lasting a single\r\n     hour, was of only three weeks' duration--hunger forced England\r\n     into peace. In her conditions Germany showed a wise moderation.\r\n     In addition to a war indemnity in accordance with the wealth of\r\n     the two conquered States, she contented herself with the\r\n     acquisition of the African Colonies, with the exception of the\r\n     southern States, which had proclaimed their independence, and\r\n     these possessions were divided with the other two powers of the\r\n     Triple Alliance. Nevertheless, this war was the end of England.\r\n     A lost battle had sufficed to manifest to the world at large\r\n     the feet of clay on which the dreaded Colossus had stood. In a\r\n     night the British Empire had crumbled altogether; the pillars\r\n     which English diplomacy had erected after years of labour had\r\n     failed at the first test.\r\n\r\nA glance at any average Pan-Germanist organ will reveal immediately how\r\nvery nearly the foregoing corresponds to a somewhat prevalent type of\r\npolitical aspiration in Germany. One Pan-Germanist writer says:\r\n\r\n     \"The future of Germany demands the absorption of\r\n     Austria-Hungary, the Balkan States, and Turkey, with the North\r\n     Sea ports. Her realms will stretch towards the east from Berlin\r\n     to Bagdad, and to Antwerp on the west.\"\r\n\r\nFor the moment we are assured there is no immediate intention of seizing\r\nthe countries in question, nor is Germany's hand actually ready yet to\r\ncatch Belgium and Holland within the net of the Federated Empire.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" he says, \"all these changes will happen within our epoch,\" and he\r\nfixes the time when the map of Europe will thus be rearranged as from\r\ntwenty to thirty years hence.\r\n\r\nGermany, according to the writer, means to fight while she has a penny\r\nleft and a man to carry arms, for she is, he says, \"face to face with a\r\ncrisis which is more serious than even that of Jena.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, recognizing the position, she is only waiting for the moment she\r\njudges the right one to break in pieces those of her neighbors who work\r\nagainst her.\r\n\r\nFrance will be her first victim, and she will not wait to be attacked.\r\nShe is, indeed, preparing for the moment when the allied Powers attempt\r\nto dictate to her.\r\n\r\nGermany, it would seem, has already decided to annex the Grand Duchy of\r\nLuxemburg, and Belgium, incidentally with, of course, Antwerp, and will\r\nadd all the northern provinces of France to her possessions, so as to\r\nsecure Boulogne and Calais.\r\n\r\nAll this is to come like a thunderbolt, and Russia, Spain, and the rest\r\nof the Powers friendly to England will not dare to move a finger to aid\r\nher. The possession of the coasts of France and Belgium will dispose of\r\nEngland's supremacy for ever.\r\n\r\nIn a book on South Africa entitled \"Reisen Erlebnisse und\r\nBeobachtungen,\" by Dr. F. Bachmar, occurs the passage:\r\n\r\n     \"My second object in writing this book is that it may happen to\r\n     our children's children to possess that beautiful and unhappy\r\n     land of whose final absorption (_gewinnung_) by our Anglo-Saxon\r\n     cousins I have not the least belief. It may be our lot to unite\r\n     this land with the German Fatherland, to be equally a blessing\r\n     to Germany and South Africa.\"\r\n\r\nThe necessity for armament is put in other than fictional form by so\r\nserious a writer as Dr. Gaevernitz, Pro-Rector of the University of\r\nFreiburg. Dr. Schulze-Gaevernitz is not unknown in England, nor is he\r\nimbued with inimical feelings towards her. But he takes the view that\r\nthe commercial prosperity of Germany depends upon her political\r\ndomination.[5]\r\n\r\nAfter having described in an impressive way the astonishing growth of\r\nGermany's trade and commerce, and shown how dangerous a competitor\r\nGermany has become for England, he returns to the old question, and asks\r\nwhat might happen if England, unable to keep down the inconvenient\r\nupstart by economic means, should, at the eleventh hour, try to knock\r\nhim down. Quotations from the _National Review_, the _Observer_, the\r\n_Outlook_, the _Saturday Review_, etc., facilitate the professor's\r\nthesis that this presumption is more than a mere abstract speculation.\r\nGranted that they voice only the sentiments of a small minority, they\r\nare, according to our author, dangerous for Germany in this--that they\r\npoint to a feasible and consequently enticing solution. The old peaceful\r\nFree Trade, he says, shows signs of senility. A new and rising\r\nImperialism is everywhere inclined to throw the weapons of political\r\nwarfare into the arena of economic rivalry.\r\n\r\nHow deeply the danger is felt even by those who sincerely desire peace\r\nand can in no sense be considered Jingoes may be judged by the following\r\nfrom the pen of Mr. Frederic Harrison. I make no apology for giving the\r\nquotations at some length. In a letter to the London _Times_ he says:\r\n\r\n     Whenever our Empire and maritime ascendancy are challenged it\r\n     will be by such an invasion in force as was once designed by\r\n     Philip and Parma, and again by Napoleon. It is this certainty\r\n     which compels me to modify the anti-militarist policy which I\r\n     have consistently maintained for forty years past.... To me now\r\n     it is no question of loss of prestige--no question of the\r\n     shrinkage of the Empire; it is our existence as a foremost\r\n     European Power, and even as a thriving nation.... If ever our\r\n     naval defence were broken through, our Navy overwhelmed or even\r\n     dispersed for a season, and a military occupation of our\r\n     arsenals, docks, and capital were effected, the ruin would be\r\n     such as modern history cannot parallel. It would not be the\r\n     Empire, but Britain, that would be destroyed.... The occupation\r\n     by a foreign invader of our arsenals, docks, cities, and\r\n     capital would be to the Empire what the bursting of the boilers\r\n     would be to a _Dreadnought_. Capital would disappear with the\r\n     destruction of credit.... A catastrophe so appalling cannot be\r\n     left to chance, even if the probabilities against its occurring\r\n     were 50 to 1. But the odds are not 50 to 1. No high authority\r\n     ventures to assert that a successful invasion of our country is\r\n     absolutely impossible if it were assisted by extraordinary\r\n     conditions. And a successful invasion would mean to us the\r\n     total collapse of our Empire, our trade, and, with trade, the\r\n     means of feeding forty millions in these islands. If it is\r\n     asked, \"Why does invasion threaten more terrible consequences\r\n     to us than it does to our neighbors?\" the answer is that the\r\n     British Empire is an anomalous structure, without any real\r\n     parallel in modern history, except in the history of Portugal,\r\n     Venice, and Holland, and in ancient history Athens and\r\n     Carthage. Our Empire presents special conditions both for\r\n     attack and for destruction. And its destruction by an enemy\r\n     seated on the Thames would have consequences so awful to\r\n     contemplate that it cannot be left to be safeguarded by one\r\n     sole line of defence, however good, and for the present hour\r\n     however adequate.... For more than forty years I have raised my\r\n     voice against every form of aggression, of Imperial expansion,\r\n     and Continental militarism. Few men have more earnestly\r\n     protested against postponing social reforms and the well-being\r\n     of the people to Imperial conquests and Asiatic and African\r\n     adventures. I do not go back on a word that I have uttered\r\n     thereon. But how hollow is all talk about industrial\r\n     reorganization until we have secured our country against a\r\n     catastrophe that would involve untold destitution and misery on\r\n     the people in the mass--which would paralyze industry and raise\r\n     food to famine prices, whilst closing our factories and our\r\n     yards!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT ILLUSION\r\n\r\n    These views founded on a gross and dangerous misconception--What\r\n    a German victory could and could not accomplish--What an English\r\n    victory could and could not accomplish--The optical illusion of\r\n    conquest--There can be no transfer of wealth--The prosperity of the\r\n    little States in Europe--German Three per Cents. at 82 and Belgian\r\n    at 96--Russian Three and a Half per Cents. at 81, Norwegian at\r\n    102--What this really means--If Germany annexed Holland, would\r\n    any German benefit or any Hollander?--The \"cash value\" of\r\n    Alsace-Lorraine.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think it will be admitted that there is not much chance of\r\nmisunderstanding the general idea embodied in the passage quoted at the\r\nend of the last chapter. Mr. Harrison is especially definite. At the\r\nrisk of \"damnable iteration\" I would again recall the fact that he is\r\nmerely expressing one of the universally accepted axioms of European\r\npolitics, namely, that a nation's financial and industrial stability,\r\nits security in commercial activity--in short, its prosperity and well\r\nbeing depend, upon its being able to defend itself against the\r\naggression of other nations, who will, if they are able, be tempted to\r\ncommit such aggression because in so doing they will increase their\r\npower, prosperity and well-being, at the cost of the weaker and\r\nvanquished.\r\n\r\nI have quoted, it is true, largely journalistic authorities because I\r\ndesired to indicate real public opinion, not merely scholarly opinion.\r\nBut Mr. Harrison has the support of other scholars of all sorts. Thus\r\nMr. Spenser Wilkinson, Chichele Professor of Military History at Oxford,\r\nand a deservedly respected authority on the subject, confirms in almost\r\nevery point in his various writings the opinions that I have quoted, and\r\ngives emphatic confirmation to all that Mr. Frederic Harrison has\r\nexpressed. In his book, \"Britain at Bay,\" Professor Wilkinson says: \"No\r\none thought when in 1888 the American observer, Captain Mahan, published\r\nhis volume on the influence of sea-power upon history, that other\r\nnations beside the British read from that book the lesson that victory\r\nat sea carried with it a prosperity and influence and a greatness\r\nobtainable by no other means.\"\r\n\r\nWell, it is the object of these pages to show that this all but\r\nuniversal idea, of which Mr. Harrison's letter is a particularly vivid\r\nexpression, is a gross and desperately dangerous misconception,\r\npartaking at times of the nature of an optical illusion, at times of the\r\nnature of a superstition--a misconception not only gross and universal,\r\nbut so profoundly mischievous as to misdirect an immense part of the\r\nenergies of mankind, and to misdirect them to such degree that unless we\r\nliberate ourselves from this superstition civilization itself will be\r\nthreatened.\r\n\r\nAnd one of the most extraordinary features of this whole question is\r\nthat the absolute demonstration of the falsity of this idea, the\r\ncomplete exposure of the illusion which gives it birth, is neither\r\nabstruse nor difficult. This demonstration does not repose upon any\r\nelaborately constructed theorem, but upon the simple exposition of the\r\npolitical facts of Europe as they exist to-day. These facts, which are\r\nincontrovertible, and which I shall elaborate presently, may be summed\r\nup in a few simple propositions stated thus:\r\n\r\n1. An extent of devastation, even approximating to that which Mr.\r\nHarrison foreshadows as the result of the conquest of Great Britain,\r\ncould only be inflicted by an invader as a means of punishment costly to\r\nhimself, or as the result of an unselfish and expensive desire to\r\ninflict misery for the mere joy of inflicting it. Since trade depends\r\nupon the existence of natural wealth and a population capable of working\r\nit, an invader cannot \"utterly destroy it,\" except by destroying the\r\npopulation, which is not practicable. If he could destroy the population\r\nhe would thereby destroy his own market, actual or potential, which\r\nwould be commercially suicidal.[6]\r\n\r\n2. If an invasion of Great Britain by Germany did involve, as Mr.\r\nHarrison and those who think with him say it would, the \"total collapse\r\nof the Empire, our trade, and the means of feeding forty millions in\r\nthese islands ... the disturbance of capital and destruction of\r\ncredit,\" German capital would also be disturbed, because of the\r\ninternationalization and delicate interdependence of our credit-built\r\nfinance and industry, and German credit would also collapse, and the\r\nonly means of restoring it would be for Germany to put an end to the\r\nchaos in England by putting an end to the condition which had produced\r\nit. Moreover, because of this delicate interdependence of our\r\ncredit-built finance, the confiscation by an invader of private\r\nproperty, whether stocks, shares, ships, mines, or anything more\r\nvaluable than jewellery or furniture--anything, in short, which is bound\r\nup with the economic life of the people--would so react upon the finance\r\nof the invader's country as to make the damage to the invader resulting\r\nfrom the confiscation exceed in value the property confiscated. So that\r\nGermany's success in conquest would be a demonstration of the complete\r\neconomic futility of conquest.\r\n\r\n3. For allied reasons, in our day the exaction of tribute from a\r\nconquered people has become an economic impossibility; the exaction of a\r\nlarge indemnity so costly directly and indirectly as to be an extremely\r\ndisadvantageous financial operation.\r\n\r\n4. It is a physical and economic impossibility to capture the external\r\nor carrying trade of another nation by military conquest. Large navies\r\nare impotent to create trade for the nations owning them, and can do\r\nnothing to \"confine the commercial rivalry\" of other nations. Nor can a\r\nconqueror destroy the competition of a conquered nation by annexation;\r\nhis competitors would still compete with him--_i.e._, if Germany\r\nconquered Holland, German merchants would still have to meet the\r\ncompetition of Dutch merchants, and on keener terms than originally,\r\nbecause the Dutch merchants would then be within the German's customs\r\nlines; the notion that the trade competition of rivals can be disposed\r\nof by conquering those rivals being one of the illustrations of the\r\ncurious optical illusion which lies behind the misconception dominating\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\n5. The wealth, prosperity, and well-being of a nation depend in no way\r\nupon its political power; otherwise we should find the commercial\r\nprosperity and social well-being of the smaller nations, which exercise\r\nno political power, manifestly below that of the great nations which\r\ncontrol Europe, whereas this is not the case. The populations of States\r\nlike Switzerland, Holland, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, are in every way as\r\nprosperous as the citizens of States like Germany, Russia, Austria, and\r\nFrance. The wealth _per capita_ of the small nations is in many cases in\r\nexcess of that of the great nations. Not only the question of the\r\nsecurity of small States, which, it might be urged, is due to treaties\r\nof neutrality, is here involved, but the question of whether political\r\npower can be turned in a positive sense to economic advantage.\r\n\r\n6. No other nation could gain any advantage by the conquest of the\r\nBritish Colonies, and Great Britain could not suffer material damage by\r\ntheir loss, however much such loss would be regretted on sentimental\r\ngrounds, and as rendering less easy a certain useful social co-operation\r\nbetween kindred peoples. The use, indeed, of the word \"loss\" is\r\nmisleading. Great Britain does not \"own\" her Colonies. They are, in\r\nfact, independent nations in alliance with the Mother Country, to whom\r\nthey are no source of tribute or economic profit (except as foreign\r\nnations are a source of profit), their economic relations being settled,\r\nnot by the Mother Country, but by the Colonies. Economically, England\r\nwould gain by their formal separation, since she would be relieved of\r\nthe cost of their defence. Their \"loss\" involving, therefore, no change\r\nin economic fact (beyond saving the Mother Country the cost of their\r\ndefence), could not involve the ruin of the Empire, and the starvation\r\nof the Mother Country, as those who commonly treat of such a contingency\r\nare apt to aver. As England is not able to exact tribute or economic\r\nadvantage, it is inconceivable that any other country, necessarily less\r\nexperienced in colonial management, would be able to succeed where\r\nEngland had failed, especially in view of the past history of the\r\nSpanish, Portuguese, French, and British Colonial Empires. This history\r\nalso demonstrates that the position of British Crown Colonies, in the\r\nrespect which we are considering, is not sensibly different from that of\r\nthe self-governing ones. It is _not_ to be presumed, therefore, that any\r\nEuropean nation, realizing the facts, would attempt the desperately\r\nexpensive business of the conquest of England for the purpose of making\r\nan experiment which all colonial history shows to be doomed to failure.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing propositions traverse sufficiently the ground covered in\r\nthe series of those typical statements of policy, both English and\r\nGerman, from which I have quoted. The simple statement of these\r\npropositions, based as they are upon the self-evident facts of\r\npresent-day European politics, sufficiently exposes the nature of those\r\npolitical axioms which I have quoted. But as men even of the calibre of\r\nMr. Harrison normally disregard these self-evident facts, it is\r\nnecessary to elaborate them at somewhat greater length.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of presenting a due parallel to the statement of policy\r\nembodied in the quotations made from the London _Times_ and Mr. Harrison\r\nand others, I have divided the propositions which I desire to\r\ndemonstrate into seven clauses, but such a division is quite arbitrary,\r\nand made only in order to bring about the parallel in question. The\r\nwhole seven can be put into one, as follows: That as the only possible\r\npolicy in our day for a conqueror to pursue is to leave the wealth of a\r\nterritory in the complete possession of the individuals inhabiting that\r\nterritory, it is a logical fallacy and an optical illusion to regard a\r\nnation as increasing its wealth when it increases its territory; because\r\nwhen a province or State is annexed, the population, who are the real\r\nand only owners of the wealth therein, are also annexed, and the\r\nconqueror gets nothing. The facts of modern history abundantly\r\ndemonstrate this. When Germany annexed Schleswig-Holstein and Alsatia\r\nnot a single ordinary German citizen was one _pfennig_ the richer.\r\nAlthough England \"owns\" Canada, the English merchant is driven out of\r\nthe Canadian markets by the merchant of Switzerland, who does not \"own\"\r\nCanada. Even where territory is not formally annexed, the conqueror is\r\nunable to take the wealth of a conquered territory, owing to the\r\ndelicate interdependence of the financial world (an outcome of our\r\ncredit and banking systems), which makes the financial and industrial\r\nsecurity of the victor dependent upon financial and industrial security\r\nin all considerable civilized centres; so that widespread confiscation\r\nor destruction of trade and commerce in a conquered territory would\r\nreact disastrously upon the conqueror. The conqueror is thus reduced to\r\neconomic impotence, which means that political and military power is\r\neconomically futile--that is to say, can do nothing for the trade and\r\nwell-being of the individuals exercising such power. Conversely, armies\r\nand navies cannot destroy the trade of rivals, nor can they capture it.\r\nThe great nations of Europe do not destroy the trade of the small\r\nnations for their own benefit, because they cannot; and the Dutch\r\ncitizen, whose Government possesses no military power, is just as well\r\noff as the German citizen, whose Government possesses an army of two\r\nmillion men, and a great deal better off than the Russian, whose\r\nGovernment possesses an army of something like four million. Thus, as a\r\nrough-and-ready though incomplete indication of the relative wealth and\r\nsecurity of the respective States, the Three per Cents. of powerless\r\nBelgium are quoted at 96, and the Three per Cents. of powerful Germany\r\nat 82; the Three and a Half per Cents. of the Russian Empire, with its\r\nhundred and twenty million souls and its four million army, are quoted\r\nat 81, while the Three and a Half per Cents. of Norway, which has not an\r\narmy at all (or any that need be considered in this discussion), are\r\nquoted at 102. All of which carries with it the paradox that the more a\r\nnation's wealth is militarily protected the less secure does it\r\nbecome.[7]\r\n\r\nThe late Lord Salisbury, speaking to a delegation of business men, made\r\nthis notable observation: The conduct of men of affairs acting\r\nindividually in their business capacity differs radically in its\r\nprinciples and application from the conduct of the same men when they\r\nact collectively in political affairs. And one of the most astonishing\r\nthings in politics is the little trouble business men take to bring\r\ntheir political creed into keeping with their daily behavior; how\r\nlittle, indeed, they realize the political implication of their daily\r\nwork. It is a case, indeed, of the forest and the trees.\r\n\r\nBut for some such phenomenon we certainly should not see the\r\ncontradiction between the daily practice of the business world and the\r\nprevailing political philosophy, which the security of property in, and\r\nthe high prosperity of, the smaller States involves. We are told by all\r\nthe political experts that great navies and great armies are necessary\r\nto protect our wealth against the aggression of powerful neighbors,\r\nwhose cupidity and voracity can be controlled by force alone; that\r\ntreaties avail nothing, and that in international politics might makes\r\nright, that military and commercial security are identical, that\r\narmaments are justified by the necessity of commercial security; that\r\nour navy is an \"insurance,\" and that a country without military power\r\nwith which their diplomats can \"bargain\" in the Council of Europe is at\r\na hopeless disadvantage economically. Yet when the investor, studying\r\nthe question in its purely financial and material aspect, has to decide\r\nbetween the great States, with all their imposing paraphernalia of\r\ncolossal armies and fabulously costly navies, and the little States,\r\npossessing relatively no military power whatever, he plumps solidly, and\r\nwith what is in the circumstances a tremendous difference, in favor of\r\nthe small and helpless. For a difference of twenty points, which we find\r\nas between Norwegian and Russian, and fourteen as between Belgian and\r\nGerman securities, is the difference between a safe and a speculative\r\none--the difference between an American railroad bond in time of\r\nprofound security and in time of widespread panic. And what is true of\r\nthe Government funds is true, in an only slightly less degree, of the\r\nindustrial securities in the national comparison just drawn.\r\n\r\nIs it a sort of altruism or quixotism which thus impels the capitalists\r\nof Europe to conclude that the public funds and investments of powerless\r\nHolland and Sweden (any day at the mercy of their big neighbors) are 10\r\nto 20 per cent. safer than those of the greatest Power of Continental\r\nEurope. The question is, of course, absurd. The only consideration of\r\nthe financier is profit and security, and he has decided that the funds\r\nof the undefended nation are more secure than the funds of one defended\r\nby colossal armaments. How does he arrive at this decision, unless it be\r\nthrough his knowledge as a financier, which, of course, he exercises\r\nwithout reference to the political implication of his decision, that\r\nmodern wealth requires no defence, because it cannot be confiscated?\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Harrison is right; if, as he implies, a nation's commerce, its\r\nvery industrial existence, would disappear if it allowed neighbors who\r\nenvied it that commerce to become its superiors in armaments, and to\r\nexercise political weight in the world, how does he explain the fact\r\nthat the great Powers of the Continent are flanked by little nations far\r\nweaker than themselves having nearly always a commercial development\r\nequal to, and in most cases greater than theirs? If the common\r\ndoctrines be true, the financiers would not invest a dollar in the\r\nterritories of the undefended nations, and yet, far from that being the\r\ncase, they consider that a Swiss or a Dutch investment is more secure\r\nthan a German one; that industrial undertakings in a country like\r\nSwitzerland defended by an army of a few thousand men, are preferable in\r\npoint of security to enterprises backed by two millions of the most\r\nperfectly trained soldiers in the world. The attitude of European\r\nfinance in this matter is the absolute condemnation of the view commonly\r\ntaken by the statesman. If a country's trade were really at the mercy of\r\nthe first successful invader; if armies and navies were really necessary\r\nfor the protection and promotion of trade, the small countries would be\r\nin a hopelessly inferior position, and could only exist on the\r\nsufferance of what we are told are unscrupulous aggressors. And yet\r\nNorway has relatively to population a greater carrying trade than Great\r\nBritain,[8] and Dutch, Swiss, and Belgian merchants compete in all the\r\nmarkets of the world successfully with those of Germany and France.\r\n\r\nThe prosperity of the small States is thus a fact which proves a good\r\ndeal more than that wealth can be secure without armaments. We have seen\r\nthat the exponents of the orthodox statecraft--notably such authorities\r\nas Admiral Mahan--plead that armaments are a necessary part of the\r\nindustrial struggle, that they are used as a means of exacting economic\r\nadvantage for a nation which would be impossible without them. \"The\r\nlogical sequence,\" we are told, is \"markets, control, navy, bases.\" The\r\nnation without political and military power is, we are assured, at a\r\nhopeless disadvantage economically and industrially.[9]\r\n\r\nWell, the relative economic situation of the small States gives the lie\r\nto this profound philosophy. It is seen to be just learned nonsense when\r\nwe realize that all the might of Russia or Germany cannot secure for the\r\nindividual citizen better general economic conditions than those\r\nprevalent in the little States. The citizens of Switzerland, Belgium, or\r\nHolland, countries without \"control,\" or navy, or bases, or \"weight in\r\nthe councils of Europe,\" or the \"prestige of a great Power,\" are just as\r\nwell off as Germans, and a great deal better off than Austrians or\r\nRussians.\r\n\r\nThus, even if it could be argued that the security of the small States\r\nis due to the various treaties guaranteeing their neutrality, it cannot\r\nbe argued that those treaties give them the political power and\r\n\"control\" and \"weight in the councils of the nations\" which Admiral\r\nMahan and the other exponents of the orthodox statecraft assure us are\r\nsuch necessary factors in national prosperity.\r\n\r\nI want, with all possible emphasis, to indicate the limits of the\r\nargument that I am trying to enforce. That argument is not that the\r\nfacts just cited show armaments or the absence of them to be the sole\r\nor even the determining factor in national wealth. It does show that\r\nthe security of wealth is due to other things than armaments; that\r\nabsence of political and military power is on the one hand no obstacle\r\nto, and on the other hand no guarantee of, prosperity; that the mere\r\nsize of the administrative area has no relation to the wealth of those\r\ninhabiting it.\r\n\r\nThose who argue that the security of the small States is due to the\r\ninternational treaties protecting their neutrality are precisely those\r\nwho argue that treaty rights are things that can never give security!\r\nThus one British military writer says:\r\n\r\n     The principle practically acted on by statesmen, though, of\r\n     course, not openly admitted, is that frankly enunciated by\r\n     Machiavelli: \"A prudent ruler ought not to keep faith when by\r\n     so doing it would be against his interests, and when the\r\n     reasons which made him bind himself no longer exist.\" Prince\r\n     Bismarck said practically the same thing, only not quite so\r\n     nakedly. The European waste-paper basket is the place to which\r\n     all treaties eventually find their way, and a thing which can\r\n     any day be placed in a waste-paper basket is a poor thing on\r\n     which to hang our national safety. Yet there are plenty of\r\n     people in this country who quote treaties to us as if we could\r\n     depend on their never being torn up. Very plausible and very\r\n     dangerous people they are--idealists too good and innocent for\r\n     a hard, cruel world, where force is the chief law. Yet there\r\n     are some such innocent people in Parliament even at present. It\r\n     is to be hoped that we shall see none of them there in\r\n     future.[10]\r\n\r\nMajor Murray is right to this extent: the militarist view, the view of\r\nthose who \"believe in war,\" and defend it even on moral grounds as a\r\nthing without which men would be \"sordid,\" supports this philosophy of\r\nforce, which flourishes in the atmosphere which the militarist regimen\r\nengenders.\r\n\r\nBut the militarist view involves a serious dilemma. If the security of a\r\nnation's wealth can only be assured by force, and treaty rights are mere\r\nwaste paper, how can we explain the evident security of the wealth of\r\nStates possessing relatively no force? By the mutual jealousies of those\r\nguaranteeing their neutrality? Then that mutual jealousy could equally\r\nwell guarantee the security of any one of the larger States against the\r\nrest. Another Englishman, Mr. Farrer, has put the case thus:\r\n\r\n     If that recent agreement between England, Germany, France,\r\n     Denmark, and Holland can so effectively relieve Denmark and\r\n     Holland from the fear of invasion that Denmark can seriously\r\n     consider the actual abolition of her army and navy, it seems\r\n     only one further step to go, for all the Powers collectively,\r\n     great and small, to guarantee the territorial independence of\r\n     each one of them severally.\r\n\r\nIn either case, the plea of the militarist stands condemned: national\r\nsafety can be secured by means other than military force.\r\n\r\nBut the real truth involves a distinction which is essential to the\r\nright understanding of this phenomenon: the political security of the\r\nsmall States is _not_ assured; no man would take heavy odds on Holland\r\nbeing able to maintain complete political independence if Germany cared\r\nseriously to threaten it. But Holland's economic security _is_ assured.\r\nEvery financier in Europe knows that if Germany conquered Holland or\r\nBelgium to-morrow, she would have to leave their wealth untouched; there\r\ncould be no confiscation. And that is why the stocks of the lesser\r\nStates, not in reality threatened by confiscation, yet relieved in part\r\nat least of the charge of armaments, stand fifteen to twenty points\r\nhigher than those of the military States. Belgium, politically, might\r\ndisappear to-morrow; her wealth would remain practically unchanged.\r\n\r\nYet, by one of those curious contradictions we are frequently meeting in\r\nthe development of ideas, while a fact like this is at least\r\nsubconsciously recognized by those whom it concerns, the necessary\r\ncorollary of it--the positive form of the merely negative truth that a\r\ncommunity's wealth cannot be stolen--is not recognized. We admit that a\r\npeople's wealth must remain unaffected by conquest, and yet we are quite\r\nprepared to urge that we can enrich ourselves by conquering them! But if\r\nwe must leave their wealth alone, how can we take it?\r\n\r\nI do not speak merely of \"loot.\" It is evident, even on cursory\r\nexamination, that no real advantage of any kind is achieved for the mass\r\nof one people by the conquest of another. Yet that end is set up in\r\nEuropean politics as desirable beyond all others. Here, for instance,\r\nare the Pan-Germanists of Germany. This party has set before itself the\r\nobject of grouping into one great Power all the peoples of the Germanic\r\nrace or language in Europe. Were this aim achieved, Germany would become\r\nthe dominating Power of the Continent, and might become the dominating\r\nPower of the world. And according to the commonly accepted view, such an\r\nachievement would, from the point of view of Germany, be worth any\r\nsacrifice that Germans could make. It would be an object so great, so\r\ndesirable, that German citizens should not hesitate for an instant to\r\ngive everything, life itself, in its accomplishment. Very good. Let us\r\nassume that at the cost of great sacrifice, the greatest sacrifice which\r\nit is possible to imagine a modern civilized nation making, this has\r\nbeen accomplished, and that Belgium and Holland and Germany, Switzerland\r\nand Austria, have all become part of the great German hegemony: _is\r\nthere one ordinary German citizen who would be able to say that his\r\nwell-being had been increased by such a change_? Germany would then\r\n\"own\" Holland. _But would a single German citizen be the richer for the\r\nownership?_ The Hollander, from having been the citizen of a small and\r\ninsignificant State, would become the citizen of a very great one.\r\n_Would the individual Hollander be any the richer or any the better?_ We\r\nknow that, as a matter of fact, neither the German nor the Hollander\r\nwould be one whit the better; and we know also, as a matter of fact,\r\nthat in all probability they would be a great deal the worse. We may,\r\nindeed, say that the Hollander would be certainly the worse, in that he\r\nwould have exchanged the relatively light taxation and light military\r\nservice of Holland for the much heavier taxation and the much longer\r\nmilitary service of the \"great\" German Empire.\r\n\r\nThe following, which appeared in the London _Daily Mail_ in reply to an\r\narticle in that paper, throws some further light on the points\r\nelaborated in this chapter. The _Daily Mail_ critic had placed\r\nAlsace-Lorraine as an asset in the German conquest worth $330,000,000\r\n\"cash value,\" and added: \"If Alsace-Lorraine had remained French, it\r\nwould have yielded, at the present rate of French taxation, a revenue of\r\n$40,000,000 a year to the State. That revenue is lost to France, and is\r\nplaced at the disposal of Germany.\"\r\n\r\nTo which I replied:\r\n\r\n     Thus, if we take the interest of the \"cash value\" at the\r\n     present price of money in Germany, Alsace-Lorraine should be\r\n     worth to the Germans about $15,000,000 a year. If we take the\r\n     other figure, $40,000,000. Suppose we split the difference, and\r\n     take, say, 20. Now, if the Germans are enriched by 20 millions\r\n     a year--if Alsace-Lorraine is really worth that income to the\r\n     German people--how much should the English people draw from\r\n     their \"possessions\"? On the basis of population, somewhere in\r\n     the region of $5,000,000,000; on the basis of area, still\r\n     more--enough not only to pay all English taxes, wipe out the\r\n     National Debt, support the army and navy, but give every family\r\n     in the land a fat income into the bargain. There is evidently\r\n     something wrong.\r\n\r\n     Does not my critic really see that this whole notion of\r\n     national possessions benefiting the individual is founded on\r\n     mystification, upon an illusion? Germany conquered France and\r\n     annexed Alsace-Lorraine. The \"Germans\" consequently \"own\" it,\r\n     and enrich themselves with this newly acquired wealth. That is\r\n     my critic's view, as it is the view of most European statesmen;\r\n     and it is all false. Alsace-Lorraine is owned by its\r\n     inhabitants, and nobody else; and Germany, with all her\r\n     ruthlessness, has not been able to dispossess them, as is\r\n     proved by the fact that the matricular contribution\r\n     (_matrikularbeitrag_) of the newly acquired State to the\r\n     Imperial treasury (which incidentally is neither 15 millions\r\n     nor 40, but just over five) is fixed on exactly the same scale\r\n     as that of the other States of the Empire. Prussia, the\r\n     conqueror, pays _per capita_ just as much as and no less than\r\n     Alsace, the conquered, who, if she were not paying this\r\n     $5,600,000 to Germany, would be paying it--or, according to my\r\n     critic, a much larger sum--to France; and if Germany did not\r\n     \"own\" Alsace-Lorraine, she would be relieved of charges that\r\n     amount not to five but many more millions. The change of\r\n     \"ownership\" does not therefore of itself change the money\r\n     position (which is what we are now discussing) of either owner\r\n     or owned.\r\n\r\n     In examining, in the last article on this matter, my critic's\r\n     balance-sheet, I remarked that were his figures as complete as\r\n     they are absurdly incomplete and misleading, I should still\r\n     have been unimpressed. We all know that very marvellous results\r\n     are possible with figures; but one can generally find some\r\n     simple fact which puts them to the supreme test without undue\r\n     mathematics. I do not know whether it has ever happened to my\r\n     critic, as it has happened to me, while watching the gambling\r\n     in the casino of a Continental watering resort, to have a\r\n     financial genius present weird columns of figures, which\r\n     demonstrate conclusively, irrefragably, that by the system\r\n     which they embody one can break the bank and win a million. I\r\n     have never examined these figures, and never shall, for this\r\n     reason: the genius in question is prepared to sell his\r\n     wonderful secret for twenty francs. Now, in the face of that\r\n     fact I am not interested in his figures. If they were worth\r\n     examination they would not be for sale.\r\n\r\n     And so in this matter there are certain test facts which upset\r\n     the adroitest statistical legerdemain. Though, really, the\r\n     fallacy which regards an addition of territory as an addition\r\n     of wealth to the \"owning\" nation is a very much simpler matter\r\n     than the fallacies lying behind gambling systems, which are\r\n     bound up with the laws of chance and the law of averages and\r\n     much else that philosophers will quarrel about till the end of\r\n     time. It requires an exceptional mathematical brain to refute\r\n     those fallacies, whereas the one we are dealing with is due\r\n     simply to the difficulty experienced by most of us in carrying\r\n     in our heads two facts at the same time. It is so much easier\r\n     to seize on one fact and forget the other. Thus we realize that\r\n     when Germany has conquered Alsace-Lorraine she has \"captured\" a\r\n     province worth, \"cash value,\" in my critic's phrase,\r\n     $330,000,000. What we overlook is that Germany has also\r\n     captured the people who own the property and who continue to\r\n     own it. We have multiplied by _x_, it is true, but we have\r\n     overlooked the fact that we have had to divide by _x_, and that\r\n     the result is consequently, so far as the individual is\r\n     concerned, exactly what it was before. My critic remembered the\r\n     multiplication all right, but he forgot the division. Let us\r\n     apply the test fact. If a great country benefits every time it\r\n     annexes a province, and her people are the richer for the\r\n     widened territory, the small nations ought to be immeasurably\r\n     poorer than the great, instead of which, by every test which\r\n     you like to apply--public credit, amounts in savings banks,\r\n     standard of living, social progress, general\r\n     well-being--citizens of small States are, other things being\r\n     equal, as well off as, or better off than, the citizens of\r\n     great States. The citizens of countries like Holland, Belgium,\r\n     Denmark, Sweden, Norway are, by every possible test, just as\r\n     well off as the citizens of countries like Germany, Austria, or\r\n     Russia. These are the facts which are so much more potent than\r\n     any theory. If it is true that a country benefits by the\r\n     acquisition of territory, and widened territory means general\r\n     well-being, why do the facts so eternally deny it? There is\r\n     something wrong with the theory.\r\n\r\n     In every civilized State, revenues which are drawn from a\r\n     territory are expended on that territory, and there is no\r\n     process known to modern government by which wealth may first be\r\n     drawn from a territory into the treasury and then be\r\n     redistributed with a profit to the individuals who have\r\n     contributed it, or to others. It would be just as reasonable to\r\n     say that the citizens of London are richer than the citizens of\r\n     Birmingham because London has a richer treasury; or that\r\n     Londoners would become richer if the London County Council were\r\n     to annex the county of Hertford; as to say that people's wealth\r\n     varies according to the size of the administrative area which\r\n     they inhabit. The whole thing is, as I have called it, an\r\n     optical illusion, due to the hypnotism of an obsolete\r\n     terminology. Just as poverty may be greater in the large city\r\n     than in the small one, and taxation heavier, so the citizens of\r\n     a great State may be poorer than the citizens of a small one,\r\n     as they very often are. Modern government is mainly, and tends\r\n     to become entirely, a matter of administration. A mere\r\n     jugglery with the administrative entities, the absorption of\r\n     small States into large ones, or the breaking up of large\r\n     States into small, is not of itself going to affect the matter\r\n     one way or the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE IMPOSSIBILITY OF CONFISCATION\r\n\r\n    Our present terminology of international politics an historical\r\n    survival--Wherein modern conditions differ from ancient--The\r\n    profound change effected by Division of Labor--The delicate\r\n    interdependence of international finance--Attila and the\r\n    Kaiser--What would happen if a German invader looted the Bank of\r\n    England--German trade dependent upon English credit--Confiscation\r\n    of an enemy's property an economic impossibility under modern\r\n    conditions--Intangibility of a community's wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the Victorian Jubilee procession an English beggar was heard to\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n     I own Australia, Canada, New Zealand, India, Burmah, and the\r\n     Islands of the Far Pacific; and I am starving for want of a\r\n     crust of bread. I am a citizen of the greatest Power of the\r\n     modern world, and all people should bow to my greatness. And\r\n     yesterday I cringed for alms to a negro savage, who repulsed me\r\n     with disgust.\r\n\r\nWhat is the meaning of this?\r\n\r\nThe meaning is that, as very frequently happens in the history of ideas,\r\nour terminology is a survival of conditions no longer existing, and our\r\nmental conceptions follow at the tail of our vocabulary. International\r\npolitics are still dominated by terms applicable to conditions which the\r\nprocesses of modern life have altogether abolished.\r\n\r\nIn the Roman times--indeed, in all the ancient world--it may have been\r\ntrue that the conquest of a territory meant a tangible advantage to the\r\nconqueror; it meant the exploitation of the conquered territory by the\r\nconquering State itself, to the advantage of that State and its\r\ncitizens. It not infrequently meant the enslavement of the conquered\r\npeople and the acquisition of wealth in the form of slaves as a direct\r\nresult of the conquering war. In mediaeval times a war of conquest meant\r\nat least immediate tangible booty in the shape of movable property,\r\nactual gold and silver, land parcelled out among the chiefs of the\r\nconquering nation, as it was at the Norman Conquest, and so forth.\r\n\r\nAt a later period conquest at least involved an advantage to the\r\nreigning house of the conquering nation, and it was mainly the squabbles\r\nof rival sovereigns for prestige and power which produced the wars of\r\nmany centuries.\r\n\r\nAt a still later period, civilization, as a whole--not necessarily the\r\nconquering nation--gained (sometimes) by the conquest of savage peoples,\r\nin that order was substituted for disorder. In the period of the\r\ncolonization of newly-discovered land, the preemption of territory by\r\none particular nation secured an advantage for the citizens of that\r\nnation, in that its overflowing population found homes in conditions\r\npreferable socially, or politically, to the conditions imposed by alien\r\nnations. _But none of these considerations applies to the problem with\r\nwhich we are dealing._ We are concerned with the case of fully civilized\r\nrival nations in fully occupied territory or with civilizations so\r\nfirmly set that conquest could not sensibly modify their character, and\r\nthe fact of conquering such territory gives to the conqueror no material\r\nadvantage which he could not have had without conquest. And in these\r\nconditions--the realities of the political world as we find it\r\nto-day--\"domination,\" or \"predominance of armament,\" or the \"command of\r\nthe sea,\" can do nothing for commerce and industry or general\r\nwell-being: England may build fifty _Dreadnoughts_ and not sell so much\r\nas a penknife the more in consequence. She might conquer Germany\r\nto-morrow, and she would find that she could not make a single\r\nEnglishman a shilling's worth the richer in consequence, the war\r\nindemnity notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nHow have conditions so changed that terms which were applicable to the\r\nancient world--in one sense at least to the mediaeval world, and in\r\nanother sense still to the world of that political renaissance which\r\ngave to Great Britain its Empire--are no longer applicable in _any_\r\nsense to the conditions of the world as we find them to-day? How has it\r\nbecome impossible for one nation to take by conquest the wealth of\r\nanother for the benefit of the people of the conqueror? How is it that\r\nwe are confronted by the absurdity (which the facts of the British\r\nEmpire go to prove) of the conquering people being able to exact from\r\nconquered territory rather less than more advantage than it was able to\r\ndo before the conquest took place?\r\n\r\nI am not at this stage going to pass in review all the factors that have\r\ncontributed to this change, because it will suffice for the\r\ndemonstration upon which I am now engaged to call attention to a\r\nphenomenon which is the outcome of all those factors and which is\r\nundeniable, and that is, the financial interdependence of the modern\r\nworld. But I will forecast here what belongs more properly to a later\r\nstage of this work, and will give just a hint of the forces which are\r\nthe result mainly of one great fact--the division of labor intensified\r\nby facility of communication.\r\n\r\nWhen the division of labor was so little developed that every homestead\r\nproduced all that it needed, it mattered nothing if part of the\r\ncommunity was cut off from the world for weeks and months at a time. All\r\nthe neighbors of a village or homestead might be slain or harassed, and\r\nno inconvenience resulted. But if to-day an English county is by a\r\ngeneral railroad strike cut off for so much as forty-eight hours from\r\nthe rest of the economic organism, we know that whole sections of its\r\npopulation are threatened with famine. If in the time of the Danes,\r\nEngland could by some magic have killed all foreigners, she would\r\npresumably have been the better off. If she could do the same thing\r\nto-day, half her population would starve to death. If on one side of the\r\nfrontier a community is, say, wheat-producing, and on the other\r\ncoal-producing, each is dependent for its very existence, on the fact of\r\nthe other being able to carry on its labor. The miner cannot in a week\r\nset to and grow a crop of wheat; the farmer must wait for his wheat to\r\ngrow, and must meantime feed his family and dependents. The exchange\r\ninvolved here must go on, and each party have fair expectation that he\r\nwill in due course be able to reap the fruits of his labor, or both must\r\nstarve; and that exchange, that expectation, is merely the expression in\r\nits simplest form of commerce and credit; and the interdependence here\r\nindicated has, by the countless developments of rapid communication,\r\nreached such a condition of complexity that the interference with any\r\ngiven operation affects not merely the parties directly involved, but\r\nnumberless others having at first sight no connection therewith.\r\n\r\nThe vital interdependence here indicated, cutting athwart frontiers, is\r\nlargely the work of the last forty years; and it has, during that time,\r\nso developed as to have set up a financial interdependence of the\r\ncapitals of the world, so complex that disturbance in New York involves\r\nfinancial and commercial disturbance in London, and, if sufficiently\r\ngrave, compels financiers of London to co-operate with those of New York\r\nto put an end to the crisis, not as a matter of altruism, but as a\r\nmatter of commercial self-protection. The complexity of modern finance\r\nmakes New York dependent on London, London upon Paris, Paris upon\r\nBerlin, to a greater degree than has ever yet been the case in history.\r\nThis interdependence is the result of the daily use of those\r\ncontrivances of civilization which date from yesterday--the rapid post,\r\nthe instantaneous dissemination of financial and commercial information\r\nby means of telegraphy, and generally the incredible increase in the\r\nrapidity of communication which has put the half-dozen chief capitals of\r\nChristendom in closer contact financially, and has rendered them more\r\ndependent the one upon the other than were the chief cities of Great\r\nBritain less than a hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nA well-known French authority, writing recently in a financial\r\npublication, makes this reflection:\r\n\r\n     The very rapid development of industry has given rise to the\r\n     active intervention therein of finance, which has become its\r\n     _nervus rerum_, and has come to play a dominating role. Under\r\n     the influence of finance, industry is beginning to lose its\r\n     exclusively national character to take on a character more and\r\n     more international. The animosity of rival nationalities seems\r\n     to be in process of attenuation as the result of this\r\n     increasing international solidarity. This solidarity was\r\n     manifested in a striking fashion in the last industrial and\r\n     monetary crisis. This crisis, which appeared in its most\r\n     serious form in the United States and Germany, far from being\r\n     any profit to rival nations, has been injurious to them. The\r\n     nations competing with America and Germany, such as England and\r\n     France, have suffered only less than the countries directly\r\n     affected. It must not be forgotten that, quite apart from the\r\n     financial interests involved, directly or indirectly, in the\r\n     industry of other countries, every producing country is at one\r\n     and the same time, as well as being a competitor and a rival, a\r\n     client and a market. Financial and commercial solidarity is\r\n     increasing every day at the expense of commercial and\r\n     industrial competition. This was certainly one of the principal\r\n     causes which a year or two ago prevented the outbreak of war\r\n     between Germany and France _a propos_ of Morocco, and which led\r\n     to the understanding of Algeciras. There can be no doubt, for\r\n     those who have studied the question, that the influence of this\r\n     international economic solidarity is increasing despite\r\n     ourselves. It has not resulted from conscious action on the\r\n     part of any of us, and it certainly cannot be arrested by any\r\n     conscious action on our part.[11]\r\n\r\nA fiery patriot sent to a London paper the following letter:\r\n\r\n     When the German army is looting the cellars of the Bank of\r\n     England, and carrying off the foundations of our whole national\r\n     fortune, perhaps the twaddlers who are now screaming about the\r\n     wastefulness of building four more _Dreadnoughts_ will\r\n     understand why sane men are regarding this opposition as\r\n     treasonable nonsense.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the result of such an action on the part of a German army\r\nin London? The first effect, of course, would be that, as the Bank of\r\nEngland is the banker of all other banks, there would be a run on every\r\nbank in England, and all would suspend payment. But London being the\r\nclearing-house of the world, bills drawn thereon but held by foreigners\r\nwould not be met; they would be valueless; the loanable value of money\r\nin other centres would be enormously raised, and instruments of credit\r\nenormously depreciated; prices of all kinds of stocks would fall, and\r\nholders would be threatened by ruin and insolvency. German finance would\r\nrepresent a condition as chaotic as that of England. Whatever advantage\r\nGerman credit might gain by holding England's gold it would certainly be\r\nmore than offset by the fact that it was the ruthless action of the\r\nGerman Government that had produced the general catastrophe. A country\r\nthat could sack bank reserves would be a good one for foreign investors\r\nto avoid: the essential of credit is confidence, and those who repudiate\r\nit pay dearly for their action. The German Generalissimo in London might\r\nbe no more civilized than Attila himself, but he would soon find the\r\ndifference between himself and Attila. Attila, luckily for him, did not\r\nhave to worry about a bank rate and such-like complications; but the\r\nGerman General, while trying to sack the Bank of England, would find\r\nthat his own balance in the Bank of Germany would have vanished into\r\nthin air, and the value of even the best of his investments dwindled as\r\nthough by a miracle; and that for the sake of loot, amounting to a few\r\nsovereigns apiece among his soldiery, he would have sacrificed the\r\ngreater part of his own personal fortune. It is as certain as anything\r\ncan be that, were the German army guilty of such economic vandalism,\r\nthere is no considerable institution in Germany that would escape grave\r\ndamage--a damage in credit and security so serious as to constitute a\r\nloss immensely greater[12] than the value of the loot obtained. It is\r\nnot putting the case too strongly to say that for every pound taken from\r\nthe Bank of England German trade would pay many times over. The\r\ninfluence of the whole finance of Germany would be brought to bear on\r\nthe German Government to put an end to a situation ruinous to German\r\ntrade, and German finance would only be saved from utter collapse by an\r\nundertaking on the part of the German Government scrupulously to respect\r\nprivate property, and especially bank reserves. It is true the German\r\nJingoes might wonder what they had made war for, and this elementary\r\nlesson in international finance would do more than the greatness of the\r\nBritish navy to cool their blood. For it is a fact in human nature that\r\nmen will fight more readily than they will pay, and that they will take\r\npersonal risks much more readily than they will disgorge money, or, for\r\nthat matter, earn it. \"Man,\" in the language of Bacon, \"loves danger\r\nbetter than travail.\"\r\n\r\nEvents which are still fresh in the memory of business men show the\r\nextraordinary interdependence of the modern financial world. A financial\r\ncrisis in New York sends up the English bank rate to 7 per cent., thus\r\ninvolving the ruin of many English businesses which might otherwise have\r\nweathered a difficult period. It thus happens that one section of the\r\nfinancial world is, against its will, compelled to come to the rescue\r\nof any other considerable section which may be in distress.\r\n\r\nFrom a modern and delightfully lucid treatise on international\r\nfinance,[13] I take the following very suggestive passages:\r\n\r\n     Banking in all countries hangs together so closely that the\r\n     strength of the best may easily be that of the weakest if\r\n     scandal arises owing to the mistakes of the worst.... Just as a\r\n     man cycling down a crowded street depends for his life not only\r\n     on his skill, but more on the course of the traffic there....\r\n     Banks in Berlin were obliged, from motives of self-protection\r\n     (on the occasion of the Wall Street crisis), to let some of\r\n     their gold go to assuage the American craving for it.... If the\r\n     crisis became so severe that London had to restrict its\r\n     facilities in this respect, other centres, which habitually\r\n     keep balances in London which they regard as so much gold,\r\n     because a draft on London is as good as gold, would find\r\n     themselves very seriously inconvenienced; and it thus follows\r\n     that it is to the interest of all other centres which trade on\r\n     those facilities which London alone gives to take care that\r\n     London's task is not made too difficult. This is especially so\r\n     in the case of foreigners, who keep a balance in London which\r\n     is borrowed. In fact, London drew in the gold required for New\r\n     York from seventeen other countries....\r\n\r\nIncidentally it may be mentioned in this connection that German commerce\r\nis in a special sense interested in the maintenance of English credit.\r\nThe authority just quoted says:\r\n\r\n     It is even contended that the rapid expansion of German trade,\r\n     which pushed itself largely by its elasticity and adaptability\r\n     to the wishes of its customers, could never have been achieved\r\n     if it had not been assisted by the large credit furnished in\r\n     London.... No one can quarrel with the Germans for making use\r\n     of the credit we offered for the expansion of the German trade,\r\n     although their over-extension of credit facilities has had\r\n     results which fall on others besides themselves....\r\n\r\n     Let us hope that our German friends are duly grateful, and let\r\n     us avoid the mistake of supposing that we have done ourselves\r\n     any permanent harm by giving this assistance. It is to the\r\n     economic interests of humanity at large that production should\r\n     be stimulated, and the economic interest of humanity at large\r\n     is the interest of England, with its mighty world-wide trade.\r\n     Germany has quickened production with the help of English\r\n     credit, and so has every other economically civilized country\r\n     in the world. It is a fact that all of them, including our own\r\n     colonies, develop their resources with the help of British\r\n     capital and credit, and then do their utmost to keep out our\r\n     productions by means of tariffs, which make it appear to\r\n     superficial observers that England provides capital for the\r\n     destruction of its own business. But in practice the system\r\n     works quite otherwise, for all these countries that develop\r\n     their resources with our money aim at developing an export\r\n     trade and selling goods to us, and as they have not yet reached\r\n     the point of economic altruism at which they are prepared to\r\n     sell goods for nothing, the increase in their production means\r\n     an increasing demand for our commodities and our services. And\r\n     in the meantime the interest on our capital and credit, and the\r\n     profits of working the machinery of exchange, are a comfortable\r\n     addition to our national income.\r\n\r\nBut what is a further corollary of this situation? It is that Germany is\r\nto-day in a larger sense than she ever was before England's debtor, and\r\nthat her industrial success is bound up with English financial security.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the situation in Britain, therefore, on the morrow of a\r\nconflict in which that country was successful?\r\n\r\nI have seen mentioned the possibility of the conquest and annexation of\r\nthe free port of Hamburg by a victorious British fleet. Let us assume\r\nthat the British Government has done this, and is proceeding to turn the\r\nannexed and confiscated property to account.\r\n\r\nNow, the property was originally of two kinds: part was private\r\nproperty, and part was German Government, or rather Hamburg Government,\r\nproperty. The income of the latter was earmarked for the payment of\r\ninterest of certain Government stock, and the action of the British\r\nGovernment, therefore, renders the stock all but valueless, and in the\r\ncase of the shares of the private companies entirely so. The paper\r\nbecomes unsaleable. But it is held in various forms--as collateral and\r\notherwise--by many important banking concerns, insurance companies, and\r\nso on, and this sudden collapse of value shatters their solvency. Their\r\ncollapse not only involves many credit institutions in Germany, but, as\r\nthese in their turn are considerable debtors of London, English\r\ninstitutions are also involved. London is also involved in another way.\r\nAs explained previously, many foreign concerns keep balances in London,\r\nand the action of the British Government having precipitated a monetary\r\ncrisis in Germany, there is a run on London to withdraw all balances. In\r\na double sense London is feeling the pinch, and it would be a miracle if\r\nalready at this point the whole influence of British finance were not\r\nthrown against the action of the British Government. Assume, however,\r\nthat the Government, making the best of a bad job, continues its\r\nadministration of the property, and proceeds to arrange for loans for\r\nthe purpose of putting it once more in good condition after the ravages\r\nof war. The banks, however, finding that the original titles have\r\nthrough the action of the British Government become waste paper, and\r\nBritish financiers having already burned their fingers with that\r\nparticular class of property, withhold support, and money is only\r\nprocurable at extortionate rates of interest--so extortionate that it\r\nbecomes quite evident that as a Governmental enterprise the thing could\r\nnot be made to pay. An attempt is made to sell the property to British\r\nand German concerns. But the same paralyzing sense of insecurity hangs\r\nover the whole business. Neither German nor British financiers can\r\nforget that the bonds and shares of this property have already been\r\nturned into waste paper by the action of the British Government. The\r\nBritish Government finds, in fact, that it can do nothing with the\r\nfinancial world unless first it confirms the title of the original\r\nowners to the property, and gives an assurance that titles to all\r\nproperty throughout the conquered territory shall be respected. In other\r\nwords, confiscation has been a failure.\r\n\r\nIt would really be interesting to know how those who talk as though\r\nconfiscation were still an economic possibility would proceed to effect\r\nit. As material property in the form of that booty which used to\r\nconstitute the spoils of victory in ancient times, the gold and silver\r\ngoblets, etc., would be quite inconsiderable, and as Britain cannot\r\ncarry away sections of Berlin and Hamburg, she could only annex the\r\npaper tokens of wealth--the shares and bonds. But the value of those\r\ntokens depends upon the reliance which can be placed upon the execution\r\nof the contracts which they embody. The act of military confiscation\r\nupsets all contracts, and the courts of the country from which contracts\r\nderive their force would be paralyzed if judicial decisions were thrust\r\naside by the sword. The value of the stocks and shares would collapse,\r\nand the credit of all those persons and institutions interested in such\r\nproperty would also be shaken or shattered, and the whole credit system,\r\nbeing thus at the mercy of alien governors only concerned to exact\r\ntribute, would collapse like a house of cards. German finance and\r\nindustry would show a condition of panic and disorder beside which the\r\nworst crises of Wall Street would pale into insignificance. Again, what\r\nwould be the inevitable result? The financial influence of London itself\r\nwould be thrown into the scale to prevent a panic in which London\r\nfinanciers would be involved. In other words, British financiers would\r\nexert their influence upon the British Government to stop the process of\r\nconfiscation.\r\n\r\nBut the intangibility of wealth can be shown in yet another fashion. I\r\nonce asked an English chartered accountant, very subject to attacks of\r\nGermanophobia, how he supposed the Germans would profit by the invasion\r\nof England, and he had a very simple programme. Admitting the\r\nimpossibility of sacking the Bank of England, they would reduce the\r\nBritish population to practical slavery, and make them work for their\r\nforeign taskmasters, as he put it, under the rifle and lash. He had it\r\nall worked out in figures as to what the profit would be to the\r\nconqueror. Very well, let us follow the process. The population of Great\r\nBritain are not allowed to spend their income, or at least are only\r\nallowed to spend a portion of it, on themselves. Their dietary is\r\nreduced more or less to a slave dietary, and the bulk of what they earn\r\nis to be taken by their \"owners.\" But how is this income, which so\r\ntempts the Germans, created--these dividends on the railroad shares, the\r\nprofits of the mills and mines and provision companies and amusement\r\nconcerns? The dividends are due to the fact that the population eat\r\nheartily, clothe themselves well, travel on railroads, and go to\r\ntheatres and music-halls. If they are not allowed to do these things,\r\nif, in other words, they cannot spend their money on these things, the\r\ndividends disappear. If the German taskmasters are to take these\r\ndividends, they must allow them to be earned. If they allow them to be\r\nearned, they must let the population live as it lived before--spending\r\ntheir income on themselves; but if they spend their income on\r\nthemselves, what is there, therefore, for the taskmasters? In other\r\nwords, consumption is a necessary factor of the whole thing. Cut out\r\nconsumption, and you cut out the profits. This glittering wealth, which\r\nso tempted the invader, has disappeared. If this is not intangibility,\r\nthe word has no meaning. Speaking broadly and generally, the conqueror\r\nin our day has before him two alternatives: to leave things alone, and\r\nin order to do that he need not have left his shores; or to interfere by\r\nconfiscation in some form, in which case he dries up the source of the\r\nprofit which tempted him.\r\n\r\nThe economist may object that this does not cover the case of such\r\nprofit as \"economic rent,\" and that dividends or profits being part of\r\nexchange, a robber who obtains wealth without exchange can afford to\r\ndisregard them; or that the increased consumption of the dispossessed\r\nEnglish community would be made up by the increased consumption of the\r\n\"owning\" Germans.\r\n\r\nIf the political control of economic operations were as simple a matter\r\nas in our minds we generally make it, these objections would be sound.\r\nAs it is, none of them would in practice invalidate the general\r\nproposition I have laid down. The division of labor in the modern world\r\nis so complex--the simplest operation of foreign trade involving not two\r\nnations merely, but many--that the mere military control of one party to\r\nan operation where many are concerned could ensure neither shifting of\r\nthe consumption nor the monopolization of the profit within the limits\r\nof the conquering group.\r\n\r\nHere is a German manufacturer selling cinematograph machines to a\r\nGlasgow suburb (which, incidentally, lives by selling tools to Argentine\r\nranchers, who live by selling wheat to Newcastle boiler-makers).\r\nAssuming even that Germany could transfer the surplus spent in\r\ncinematograph shows to Germany, what assurance has the German\r\nmanufacturer in question that the enriched Germans will want\r\ncinematograph films? They may insist upon champagne and cigars, coffee\r\nand Cognac, and the French, Cubans, and Brazilians, to whom this \"loot\"\r\neventually goes, may not buy their machinery from Germany at all, much\r\nless from the particular German manufacturer, but in the United States\r\nor Switzerland. The redistribution of the industrial roles might leave\r\nGerman industry in the lurch, because at best the military power would\r\nonly be controlling one section of a complex operation, one party to it\r\nout of many. When wealth was corn or cattle, the transference by\r\npolitical or military force of the possessions of one community to\r\nanother may have been possible, although even then, or in a slightly\r\nmore developed period, we saw the Roman peasantry ruined by the slave\r\nexploitation of foreign territory. How far this complexity of the\r\ninternational division of labor tends to render futile the other\r\ncontrivances of conquest such as exclusive markets, tribute, money\r\nindemnity, etc., succeeding chapters may help to show.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nFOREIGN TRADE AND MILITARY POWER\r\n\r\n    Why trade cannot be destroyed or captured by a military Power--What\r\n    the processes of trade really are, and how a navy affects\r\n    them--_Dreadnoughts_ and business--While _Dreadnoughts_ protect\r\n    British trade from hypothetical German warships, the real German\r\n    merchant is carrying it off, or the Swiss or the Belgian--The\r\n    \"commercial aggression\" of Switzerland--What lies at the bottom of\r\n    the futility of military conquest--Government brigandage becomes as\r\n    profitless as private brigandage--The real basis of commercial\r\n    honesty on the part of Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust as Mr. Harrison has declared that a \"successful invasion would mean\r\nto the English the total eclipse of their commerce and trade, and with\r\nthat trade the means of feeding forty millions in their islands,\" so I\r\nhave seen it stated in a leading English paper that \"if Germany were\r\nextinguished to-morrow, the day after to-morrow there is not an\r\nEnglishman in the world who would not be the richer. Nations have fought\r\nfor years over a city or right of succession. Must they not fight for\r\n1250 million dollars of yearly commerce?\"\r\n\r\nWhat does the \"extinction\" of Germany mean? Does it mean that Britain\r\nshall slay in cold blood sixty or seventy millions of men, women, and\r\nchildren? Otherwise, even though the fleet and army were annihilated the\r\ncountry's sixty millions of workers would still remain,--all the more\r\nindustrious, as they would have undergone great suffering and\r\nprivation--prepared to exploit their mines and workshops with as much\r\nthoroughness and thrift and industry as ever, and consequently just as\r\nmuch trade rivals as ever, army or no army, navy or no navy.\r\n\r\nEven if the British could annihilate Germany, they would annihilate such\r\nan important section of their debtors as to create hopeless panic in\r\nLondon, and that panic would so react on their own trade that it would\r\nbe in no sort of condition to take the place which Germany had\r\npreviously occupied in neutral markets, leaving aside the question that\r\nby the act of annihilation a market equal to that of Canada and South\r\nAfrica combined would be destroyed.\r\n\r\nWhat does this sort of thing mean? Am I wrong in saying that the whole\r\nsubject is overlaid and dominated by a jargon which may have had some\r\nrelation to facts at one time, but from which in our day all meaning has\r\ndeparted?\r\n\r\nThe English patriot may say that he does not mean permanent destruction,\r\nbut only temporary \"annihilation.\" (And this, of course, on the other\r\nside, would mean not permanent, but only temporary acquisition of that\r\n1250 millions of trade.)\r\n\r\nHe might, like Mr. Harrison, put the case conversely--that if Germany\r\ncould get command of the sea she could cut England off from its\r\ncustomers and intercept its trade for her benefit. This notion is as\r\nabsurd as the other. It has already been shown that the \"utter\r\ndestruction of credit\" and \"incalculable chaos in the financial world,\"\r\nwhich Mr. Harrison foresees as the result of Germany's invasion, could\r\nnot possibly leave German finance unaffected. It is a very open question\r\nwhether her chaos would not be as great as the English. In any case, it\r\nwould be so great as thoroughly to disorganize her industry, and in that\r\ndisorganized condition it would be out of the question for her to secure\r\nthe markets left unsupplied by England's isolation. Moreover, those\r\nmarkets would also be disorganized, because they depend upon England's\r\nability to buy, which Germany would be doing her best to destroy. From\r\nthe chaos which she herself had created, Germany could derive no\r\npossible benefit, and she could only terminate financial disorder, fatal\r\nto her own trade, by bringing to an end the condition which had produced\r\nit--that is, by bringing to an end the isolation of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nWith reference to this section of the subject we can with absolute\r\ncertainty say two things: (1) That Germany can only destroy British\r\ntrade by destroying British population; and (2) that if she could\r\ndestroy that population, which she could not, she would destroy one of\r\nher most valuable markets, as at the present time she sells to it more\r\nthan it sells to her. The whole point of view involves a fundamental\r\nmisconception of the real nature of commerce and industry.\r\n\r\nCommerce is simply and purely the exchange of one product for another.\r\nIf the British manufacturer can make cloth, or cutlery, or machinery, or\r\npottery, or ships cheaper or better than his rivals, he will obtain the\r\ntrade; if he cannot, if his goods are inferior or dearer, or appeal less\r\nto his customers, his rivals will secure the trade, and the possession\r\nof _Dreadnoughts_ will make not a whit of difference. Switzerland,\r\nwithout a single _Dreadnought_, will drive him out of the market even of\r\nhis own colonies, as, indeed, she is driving him out.[14] The factors\r\nwhich really constitute prosperity have not the remotest connection with\r\nmilitary or naval power, all our political jargon notwithstanding. To\r\ndestroy the commerce of forty million people Germany would have to\r\ndestroy Britain's coal and iron mines, to destroy the energy, character,\r\nand resourcefulness of its population; to destroy, in short, the\r\ndetermination of forty million people to make their living by the work\r\nof their hands. Were we not hypnotized by this extraordinary illusion,\r\nwe should accept as a matter of course that the prosperity of a people\r\ndepends upon such facts as the natural wealth of the country in which\r\nthey live, their social discipline and industrial character, the result\r\nof years, of generations, of centuries, it may be, of tradition and\r\nslow, elaborate, selective processes; and, in addition to all these\r\ndeep-seated elementary factors, upon countless commercial and financial\r\nramifications--a special technical capacity for such-and-such a\r\nmanufacture, a special aptitude for meeting the peculiarities of such\r\nand-such a market, the efficient equipment of elaborately constructed\r\nworkshops, the existence of a population trained to given trades--a\r\ntraining not infrequently involving years, and even generations, of\r\neffort. All this, according to Mr. Harrison, is to go for nothing, and\r\nGermany is to be able to replace it in the twinkling of an eye, and\r\nforty million people are to sit down helplessly because Germany has been\r\nvictorious at sea. On the morrow of her marvellous victory Germany is by\r\nsome sort of miracle to find shipyards, foundries, cotton-mills, looms,\r\nfactories, coal and iron mines, and all their equipment, suddenly\r\ncreated in order to take the trade that the most successful\r\nmanufacturers and traders in the world have been generations in building\r\nup. Germany is to be able suddenly to produce three or four times what\r\nher population has hitherto been able to produce; for she must either do\r\nthat or leave the markets which England has supplied heretofore still\r\navailable to English effort. What has really fed these forty millions,\r\nwho are to starve on the morrow of Germany's naval victory, is the fact\r\nthat the coal and iron exported by them have been sent in one form or\r\nanother to populations which need those products. Is that need suddenly\r\nto cease, or are the forty millions suddenly to be struck with some sort\r\nof paralysis, that all this vast industry is coming to an end? What has\r\nthe defeat of English ships at sea to do with the fact that the Canadian\r\nfarmer wants to buy English manufactures and pay for them with his\r\nwheat? It may be true that Germany could stop the importation of that\r\nwheat. But why should she want to do so? How would it benefit her people\r\nto do so? By what sort of miracle is she suddenly to be able to supply\r\nproducts which have kept forty million people busy? By what sort of\r\nmiracle is she suddenly to be able to double her industrial population?\r\nAnd by what sort of miracle is she to be able to consume the wheat,\r\nbecause if she cannot take the wheat the Canadian cannot buy her\r\nproducts? I am aware that all this is elementary, that it is economics\r\nin words of one syllable; but what are the economics of Mr. Harrison and\r\nthose who think like him when he talks in the strain of the passage that\r\nI have just quoted?\r\n\r\nThere is just one other possible meaning that the English patriot may\r\nhave in his mind. He may plead that great military and naval\r\nestablishments do not exist for the purpose of the conquest of territory\r\nor of destroying a rival's trade, but for \"protecting\" or indirectly\r\naiding trade and industry. We are allowed to infer that in some not\r\nclearly defined way a great Power can aid the trade of its citizens by\r\nthe use of the prestige which a great navy and a great army bring, and\r\nby exercising bargaining power, in the matter of tariffs, with other\r\nnations. But again the condition of the small nations in Europe gives\r\nthe lie to this assumption.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the neutral does not buy English products and refuse\r\nGermany's because England has a larger navy. If one can imagine the\r\nrepresentatives of an English and a German firm meeting in the office\r\nof a merchant in Argentina, or Brazil, or Bulgaria, or Finland, both of\r\nthem selling cutlery, the German is not going to secure the order\r\nbecause he is able to show the Argentinian, or the Brazilian, or the\r\nBulgarian, or the Finn that Germany has twelve _Dreadnoughts_ and\r\nEngland only eight. The German will take the order if, on the whole, he\r\ncan make a more advantageous offer to the prospective buyer, and for no\r\nother reason whatsoever, and the buyer will go to the merchant of any\r\nnation whatever, whether he be German, or Swiss, or Belgian, or British,\r\nirrespective of the armies and navies which may lie behind the\r\nnationality of the seller. Nor does it appear that armies and navies\r\nweigh in the least when it comes to a question of a tariff bargain.\r\nSwitzerland wages a tariff war with Germany, and wins. The whole history\r\nof the trade of the small nations shows that the political prestige of\r\nthe great ones gives them practically no commercial advantage.\r\n\r\nWe continually talk as though carrying trade were in some special sense\r\nthe result of the growth of a great navy, but Norway has a carrying\r\ntrade which, relatively to her population, is nearly three times as\r\ngreat as Britain's, and the same reasons which would make it impossible\r\nfor another nation to confiscate the gold reserve of the Bank of England\r\nwould make it impossible for another nation to confiscate British\r\nshipping on the morrow of a British naval defeat. In what way can her\r\ncarrying trade or any other trade be said to depend upon military\r\npower?\r\n\r\nAs I write these lines there comes to my notice a series of articles in\r\nthe London _Daily Mail_, written by Mr. F.A. McKenzie, explaining how it\r\nis that England is losing the trade of Canada. In one article he quotes\r\na number of Canadian merchants:\r\n\r\n     \"We buy very little direct from England,\" said Mr. Harry McGee,\r\n     one of the vice-presidents of the company, in answer to my\r\n     questions. \"We keep a staff in London of twenty, supervising\r\n     our European purchases, but the orders go mostly to France,\r\n     Germany, and Switzerland, and not to England.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in a further article he notes that many orders are going to Belgium.\r\nNow the question arises: What more can a navy do that it has not done\r\nfor England in Canada? And yet the trade goes to Switzerland and\r\nBelgium. Is England going to protect herself against the commercial\r\n\"aggression\" of Switzerland by building a dozen more _Dreadnoughts_?\r\nSuppose she could conquer Switzerland and Belgium with her\r\n_Dreadnoughts_, would not the trade of Switzerland and Belgium go on all\r\nthe same? Her arms have brought her Canada--but no monopoly of the\r\nCanadian orders, which go, in part, to Switzerland.\r\n\r\nIf the traders of little nations can snap their fingers at the great war\r\nlords, why do British traders need _Dreadnoughts_? If Swiss commercial\r\nprosperity is secure from the aggression of a neighbor who outweighs\r\nSwitzerland in military power a hundred to one, how comes it that the\r\ntrade and industry, the very life-bread of her children, as Mr.\r\nHarrison would have us believe, of the greatest nation in history is in\r\ndanger of imminent annihilation the moment she loses her military\r\npredominance?\r\n\r\nIf the statesmen of Europe would tell us _how_ the military power of a\r\ngreat nation is used to advance the commercial interest of its citizens,\r\nwould explain to us the _modus operandi_, and not refer us to large and\r\nvague phrases about \"exercising due weight in the councils of the\r\nnations,\" we might accept their philosophy. But, until they do so, we\r\nare surely justified in assuming that their political terminology is\r\nsimply a survival--an inheritance from a state of things which has, in\r\nfact, passed away.\r\n\r\nIt is facts of the nature of those I have instanced which constitute the\r\nreal protection of the small State, and which are bound as they gain in\r\ngeneral recognition to constitute the real protection from outside\r\naggression of all States, great or small.\r\n\r\nOne financial authority from whom I have quoted noted that this\r\nelaborate financial interdependence of the modern world has grown up in\r\nspite of ourselves, \"without our noticing it until we put it to some\r\nrude test.\" Men are fundamentally just as disposed as they were at any\r\ntime to take wealth that does not belong to them, which they have not\r\nearned. But their relative interest in the matter has changed. In very\r\nprimitive conditions robbery is a moderately profitable enterprise.\r\nWhere the rewards of labor, owing to the inefficiency of the means of\r\nproduction, are small and uncertain, and where all wealth is portable,\r\nraiding and theft offer the best reward for the enterprise of the\r\ncourageous; in such conditions the size of man's wealth depends a good\r\ndeal on the size of his club and the agility with which he wields it.\r\nBut to the man whose wealth so largely depends upon his credit and on\r\nhis paper being \"good paper\" at the bank, dishonesty has become as\r\nprecarious and profitless as honest toil was in more primitive times.\r\n\r\nThe instincts of the business man may, at bottom, be just as predatory\r\nas those of the cattle-lifter or the robber baron, but taking property\r\nby force has become one of the least profitable and the most speculative\r\nforms of enterprise upon which he could engage. The force of commercial\r\nevents has rendered the thing impossible. I know that the defender of\r\narms will reply that it is the police who have rendered it impossible.\r\nThis is not true. There were as many armed men in Europe in the days\r\nwhen the robber baron carried on his occupation as there are in our day.\r\nTo say that the policeman makes him impossible is to put the cart before\r\nthe horse. What created the police and made them possible, if it was not\r\nthe general recognition of the fact that disorder and aggression make\r\ntrade impossible?\r\n\r\nJust note what is taking place in South America. States in which\r\nrepudiation was a commonplace of everyday politics have of recent years\r\nbecome as stable and as respectable as the City of London, and have come\r\nto discharge their obligations as regularly. These countries were during\r\nhundreds of years a slough of disorder and a never-ending sanguinary\r\nscramble for the spoils, and yet in a matter of fifteen or twenty years\r\nthe conditions have radically changed. Does this mean that the nature of\r\nthese populations has fundamentally altered in less than a generation?\r\nIn that case many a militarist claim must be rejected. There is a\r\nsimpler explanation.\r\n\r\nThese countries, like Brazil and the Argentine, have been drawn into the\r\ncircle of international trade, exchange, and finance. Their economic\r\nrelationships have become sufficiently extensive and complex to make\r\nrepudiation the least profitable form of theft. The financier will tell\r\nyou \"they cannot afford to repudiate.\" If any attempt at repudiation\r\nwere made, all sorts of property, either directly or indirectly\r\nconnected with the orderly execution of Governmental functions, would\r\nsuffer, banks would become involved, great businesses would stagger, and\r\nthe whole financial community would protest. To attempt to escape the\r\npayment of a single loan would involve the business world in losses\r\namounting to many times the value of the loan.\r\n\r\nIt is only where a community has nothing to lose, no banks, no personal\r\nfortunes dependent upon public good faith, no great businesses, no\r\nindustries, that the Government can afford to repudiate its obligations\r\nor to disregard the general code of economic morality. This was the case\r\nwith Argentina and Brazil a generation ago; it is still the case, to\r\nsome extent, with some Central American States to-day. _It is not\r\nbecause the armies in these States have grown_ that the public credit\r\nhas improved. Their armies were greater a generation ago than they are\r\nnow. It is because they know that trade and finance are built upon\r\ncredit--that is, confidence in the fulfilment of obligations, upon\r\nsecurity of tenure in titles, upon the enforcement of contract according\r\nto law--and that if credit is seriously shaken, there is not a section\r\nof the elaborate fabric which is not affected.\r\n\r\nThe more our commercial system gains in complication, the more does the\r\ncommon prosperity of all of us come to depend upon the reliance which\r\ncan be placed on the due performance of all contracts. This is the real\r\nbasis of \"prestige,\" national and individual; circumstances stronger\r\nthan ourselves are pushing us, despite what the cynical critics of our\r\ncommercial civilization may say, towards the unvarying observance of\r\nthis simple ideal. When we drop back from it--and such relapses occur as\r\nwe should expect them to occur, especially in those societies which have\r\njust emerged from a more or less primitive state--punishment is\r\ngenerally swift and sure.\r\n\r\nWhat was the real origin of the bank crisis of 1907 in the United\r\nStates, which had for American business men such disastrous\r\nconsequences? It was the loss by American financiers and American\r\nbankers of the confidence of the American public. At bottom there was no\r\nother reason. One talks of cash reserves and currency errors; but\r\nLondon, which does the banking of the universe, works on the smallest\r\ncash reserve in the world, because, as an American authority has put it,\r\nEnglish bankers work with a \"psychological reserve.\"\r\n\r\nI quote from Mr. Withers:\r\n\r\n     It is because they (English bankers) are so safe, so straight,\r\n     so sensible, from an American point of view so unenterprising,\r\n     that they are able to build up a bigger credit fabric on a\r\n     smaller gold basis, and even carry this building to a height\r\n     which they themselves have decided to be questionable. This\r\n     \"psychological reserve\" is the priceless possession that has\r\n     been handed down through generations of good bankers, and every\r\n     individual of every generation who receives it can do something\r\n     to maintain and improve it.\r\n\r\nBut it was not always thus, and it is merely the many ramifications of\r\nthe English commercial and financial world that have brought this about.\r\nIn the end the Americans will imitate it, or they will suffer from a\r\nhopeless disadvantage in their financial competition with England.\r\nCommercial development is broadly illustrating one profound truth: that\r\nthe real basis of social morality is self-interest. If English banks and\r\ninsurance companies have become absolutely honest in their\r\nadministration, it is because the dishonesty of any one of them\r\nthreatened the prosperity of all.\r\n\r\nMust we assume that the Governments of the world, which, presumably, are\r\ndirected by men as far-sighted as bankers, are permanently to fall below\r\nthe banker in their conception of enlightened self-interest? Must we\r\nassume that what is self-evident to the banker--namely, that the\r\nrepudiation of engagements, or any attempt at financial plunder, is\r\nsheer stupidity and commercial suicide--is for ever to remain\r\nunperceived by the ruler? Then, when he realizes this truth, shall we\r\nnot at least have made some progress towards laying the foundations for\r\na sane international polity?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following correspondence, provoked by the first edition of this\r\nbook, may throw light on some of the points dealt with in this chapter.\r\nA correspondent of London _Public Opinion_ criticized a part of the\r\nthesis here dealt with as a \"series of half-truths,\" questioning as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     What is \"natural wealth,\" and how can trade be carried on with\r\n     it unless there are markets for it when worked? Would the\r\n     writer maintain that markets cannot be permanently or seriously\r\n     affected by military conquests, especially if conquest be\r\n     followed by the imposition upon the vanquished of commercial\r\n     conditions framed in the interests of the victor?... Germany\r\n     has derived, and continues to derive, great advantages from the\r\n     most-favored-nation clause which she compelled France to insert\r\n     in the Treaty of Frankfurt.... Bismarck, it is true,\r\n     underestimated the financial resilience of France, and was\r\n     sorely disappointed when the French paid off the indemnity with\r\n     such astonishing rapidity, and thus liberated themselves from\r\n     the equally crushing burden of having to maintain the German\r\n     army of occupation. He regretted not having demanded an\r\n     indemnity twice as large. Germany would not repeat the mistake,\r\n     and any country having the misfortune to be vanquished by her\r\n     in future will be likely to find its commercial prosperity\r\n     compromised for decades.\r\n\r\nTo which I replied:\r\n\r\n     Will your correspondent forgive my saying that while he talks\r\n     of half-truths, the whole of this passage indicates the\r\n     domination of that particular half-truth which lies at the\r\n     bottom of the illusion with which my book deals?\r\n\r\n     What is a market? Your correspondent evidently conceives it as\r\n     a place where things are sold. That is only half the truth. It\r\n     is a place where things are bought and sold, and one operation\r\n     is impossible without the other, and the notion that one nation\r\n     can sell for ever and never buy is simply the theory of\r\n     perpetual motion applied to economics; and international trade\r\n     can no more be based upon perpetual motion than can\r\n     engineering. As between economically highly-organized nations a\r\n     customer must also be a competitor, a fact which bayonets\r\n     cannot alter. To the extent to which they destroy him as a\r\n     competitor, they destroy him, speaking generally, and largely,\r\n     as a customer.\r\n\r\n     The late Mr. Seddon conceived England as making her purchases\r\n     with \"a stream of golden sovereigns\" flowing from a stock all\r\n     the time getting smaller. That \"practical\" man, however, who so\r\n     despised \"mere theories,\" was himself the victim of a pure\r\n     theory, and the picture which he conjured up from his inner\r\n     consciousness has no existence in fact. England has hardly\r\n     enough gold to pay one year's taxes, and if she paid for her\r\n     imports in gold she would exhaust her stock in three months;\r\n     and the process by which she really pays has been going on for\r\n     sixty years. She is a buyer just as long as she is a seller,\r\n     and if she is to afford a market to Germany she must procure\r\n     the money wherewith to pay for Germany's goods by selling goods\r\n     to Germany or elsewhere, and if that process of sale stops,\r\n     Germany loses a market, not only the English market, but also\r\n     those markets which depend in their turn upon England's\r\n     capacity to buy--that is to say, to sell, for, again, the one\r\n     operation is impossible without the other.\r\n\r\n     If your correspondent had had the whole process in his mind\r\n     instead of half of it, I do not think that he would have\r\n     written the passages I have quoted. In his endorsement of the\r\n     Bismarckian conception of political economy he evidently deems\r\n     that one nation's gain is the measure of another nation's loss,\r\n     and that nations live by robbing their neighbors in a lesser or\r\n     greater degree. This is economics in the style of Tamerlane and\r\n     the Red Indian, and, happily, has no relation to the real facts\r\n     of modern commercial intercourse.\r\n\r\n     The conception of one-half of the case only, dominates your\r\n     correspondent's letter throughout. He says, \"Germany has\r\n     derived, and continues to derive, great advantage from the\r\n     most-favored-nation clause which she compelled France to insert\r\n     in the Treaty of Frankfurt,\" which is quite true, but leaves\r\n     out the other half of the truth, somewhat important to our\r\n     discussion--viz., that France has also greatly benefited, in\r\n     that the scope of fruitless tariff war has been by so much\r\n     restricted.\r\n\r\n     A further illustration: Why should Germany have been sorely\r\n     disappointed at France's rapid recovery? The German people are\r\n     not going to be the richer for having a poor neighbor--on the\r\n     contrary, they are going to be the poorer, and there is not an\r\n     economist with a reputation to lose, whatever his views of\r\n     fiscal policy, who would challenge this for a moment.\r\n\r\n     How would Germany impose upon a vanquished England commercial\r\n     arrangements which would impoverish the vanquished and enrich\r\n     the victor? By enforcing another Frankfurt treaty, by which\r\n     English ports should be kept open to German goods? But that is\r\n     precisely what English ports have been for sixty years, and\r\n     Germany has not been obliged to wage a costly war to effect it.\r\n     Would Germany close her own markets to our goods? But, again,\r\n     that is precisely what she has done--again without war, and by\r\n     a right which we never dream of challenging. How is war going\r\n     to affect the question one way or another? I have been asking\r\n     for a detailed answer to that question from European publicists\r\n     and statesmen for the last ten years, and I have never yet been\r\n     answered, save by much vagueness, much fine phrasing concerning\r\n     commercial supremacy, a spirited foreign policy, national\r\n     prestige, and much else, which no one seems able to define, but\r\n     a real policy, a _modus operandi_, a balance-sheet which one\r\n     can analyze, never. And until such is forthcoming I shall\r\n     continue to believe that the whole thing is based upon an\r\n     illusion.\r\n\r\n     The true test of fallacies of this kind is progression. Imagine\r\n     Germany (as our Jingoes seem to dream of her) absolute master\r\n     of Europe, and able to dictate any policy that she pleased. How\r\n     would she treat such a European empire? By impoverishing its\r\n     component parts? But that would be suicidal. Where would her\r\n     big industrial population find their markets?[15] If she set\r\n     out to develop and enrich the component parts, these would\r\n     become merely efficient competitors, and she need not have\r\n     undertaken the costliest war of history to arrive at that\r\n     result. This is the paradox, the futility of conquest--the\r\n     great illusion which the history of our own Empire so well\r\n     illustrates. We British \"own\" our Empire by allowing its\r\n     component parts to develop themselves in their own way, and in\r\n     view of their own ends, and all the empires which have pursued\r\n     any other policy have only ended by impoverishing their own\r\n     populations and falling to pieces.\r\n\r\n     Your correspondent asks: \"Is Mr. Norman Angell prepared to\r\n     maintain that Japan has derived no political or commercial\r\n     advantages from her victories, and that Russia has suffered no\r\n     loss from defeat?\"\r\n\r\n     What I am prepared to maintain, and what the experts know to be\r\n     the truth, is that the Japanese people are the poorer, not the\r\n     richer for their war, and that the Russian people will gain\r\n     more from defeat than they could possibly have gained by\r\n     victory, since defeat will constitute a check on the\r\n     economically sterile policy of military and territorial\r\n     aggrandizement and turn Russian energies to social and economic\r\n     development; and it is because of this fact that Russia is at\r\n     the present moment, despite her desperate internal troubles,\r\n     showing a capacity for economic regeneration as great as, if\r\n     not greater than, that of Japan. This latter country is\r\n     breaking all modern records, civilized or uncivilized, in the\r\n     burdensomeness of her taxation. On the average, the Japanese\r\n     people pay 30 per cent.--nearly one-third--of their net income\r\n     in taxation in one form or another, and so far have they been\r\n     compelled to push the progressive principle that a Japanese\r\n     lucky enough to possess an income of ten thousand a year has to\r\n     surrender over six thousand of it in taxation, a condition of\r\n     things which would, of course, create a revolution in any\r\n     European country in twenty-four hours. And this is quoted as a\r\n     result so brilliant that those who question it cannot be doing\r\n     so seriously![16] On the other side, for the first time in\r\n     twenty years the Russian Budget shows a surplus.\r\n\r\n     This recovery of the defeated nation after wars is not even\r\n     peculiar to our generation. Ten years after the Franco-Prussian\r\n     War France was in a better financial position than Germany, as\r\n     she is in a better financial position to-day, and though her\r\n     foreign trade does not show as great expansion as that of\r\n     Germany--because her population remains absolutely stationary,\r\n     while that of Germany increases by leaps and bounds--the French\r\n     people as a whole are more prosperous, more comfortable, more\r\n     economically secure, with a greater reserve of savings, and all\r\n     the moral and social advantages that go therewith, than are the\r\n     Germans. In the same way the social and industrial renaissance\r\n     of modern Spain dates from the day that she was defeated and\r\n     lost her colonies, and it is since her defeat that Spanish\r\n     securities have just doubled in value.[17] It is since England\r\n     added the \"gold-fields of the world\" to her \"possessions\" that\r\n     British Consols have dropped twenty points. Such is the outcome\r\n     in terms of social well-being of military success and political\r\n     prestige!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE INDEMNITY FUTILITY\r\n\r\n    The real balance-sheet of the Franco-German War--Disregard of Sir\r\n    Robert Giffen's warning in interpreting the figures--What really\r\n    happened in France and Germany during the decade following the\r\n    war--Bismarck's disillusionment--The necessary discount to be\r\n    given an indemnity--The bearing of the war and its result on\r\n    German prosperity and progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn politics it is unfortunately true that ten dollars which can be seen\r\nbulk more largely in the public mind than a million which happen to be\r\nout of sight but are none the less real. Thus, however clearly the\r\nwastefulness of war and the impossibility of effecting by its means any\r\npermanent economic or social advantage for the conqueror may be shown,\r\nthe fact that Germany was able to exact an indemnity of a billion\r\ndollars from France at the close of the war of 1870-71 is taken as\r\nconclusive evidence that a nation can \"make money by war.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1872, Sir Robert (then Mr.) Giffen wrote a notable article\r\nsummarizing the results of the Franco-German War thus: it meant to\r\nFrance a loss of 3500 million dollars, and to Germany a total net gain\r\nof 870 millions, a money difference in favor of Germany exceeding in\r\nvalue the whole amount of the British National Debt!\r\n\r\nAn arithmetical statement of this kind seems at first sight so\r\nconclusive that those who have since discussed the financial outcome of\r\nthe war of 1870 have quite overlooked the fact that, if such a\r\nbalance-sheet as that indicated be sound, the whole financial history of\r\nGermany and France during the forty years which have followed the war is\r\nmeaningless.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, of course, that such a balance-sheet is meaningless--a\r\nverdict which does not reflect upon Sir Robert Giffen, because he drew\r\nit up in ignorance of the sequel of the war. It does, however, reflect\r\non those who have adopted the result shown on such a balance-sheet.\r\nIndeed, Sir Robert Giffen himself made the most important reservations.\r\nHe had at least an inkling of the practical difficulties of profiting by\r\nan indemnity, and indicated plainly that the nominal figures had to be\r\nvery heavily discounted.\r\n\r\nA critic[18] of an early edition of this book seems to have adopted most\r\nof Sir Robert Giffen's figures, disregarding, however, certain of his\r\nreservations, and to this critic I replied as follows:\r\n\r\n     In arriving at this balance my critic, like the\r\n     company-promoting genius who promises you 150 per cent. for\r\n     your money, leaves so much out of the account. There are a few\r\n     items not considered, _e.g._ the increase in the French army\r\n     which took place immediately after the war, and as the direct\r\n     result thereof, compelled Germany to increase her army by at\r\n     least one hundred thousand men, an increase which has been\r\n     maintained for forty years. The expenditure throughout this\r\n     time amounts to at least a billion dollars. We have already\r\n     wiped out the \"profit,\" and I have only dealt with one item\r\n     yet--to this we must add,--loss of markets for Germany involved\r\n     in the destruction of so many French lives and so much French\r\n     wealth; loss from the general disturbance throughout Europe,\r\n     and still greater loss from the fact that the unproductive\r\n     expenditure on armaments throughout the greater part of Europe\r\n     which has followed the war, the diversion of energies which is\r\n     the result of it, has directly deprived Germany of large\r\n     markets and by a general check of development indirectly\r\n     deprived her of immense ones.\r\n\r\n     But it is absurd to bring figures to bear on such a system of\r\n     bookkeeping as that adopted by my critic. Germany had several\r\n     years' preparation for the war, and has had, as the direct\r\n     result thereof and as an integral part of the general war\r\n     system which her own policy supports, certain obligations\r\n     during forty years. All this is ignored. Just note how the same\r\n     principle would work if applied in ordinary commercial matters;\r\n     because, for instance, on an estate the actual harvest only\r\n     takes a fortnight, you disregard altogether the working\r\n     expenses for the remaining fifty weeks of the year, charge only\r\n     the actual cost of the harvest (and not all of that), deduct\r\n     this from the gross proceeds of the crops, and call the result\r\n     \"profit\"! Such \"finance\" is really luminous. Applied by the\r\n     ordinary business man, it would in an incredibly short time put\r\n     his business in the bankruptcy court and himself in gaol!\r\n\r\n     But were my critic's figures as complete as they are absurdly\r\n     incomplete and misleading, I should still be unimpressed,\r\n     because the facts which stare us in the face would not\r\n     corroborate his statistical performance. We are examining what\r\n     is from the money point of view the most successful war ever\r\n     recorded in history, and if the general proposition that such a\r\n     war is financially profitable were sound, and if the results of\r\n     the war were anything like as brilliant as they are\r\n     represented, money should be cheaper and more plentiful in\r\n     Germany than in France, and credit, public and private, should\r\n     be sounder. Well, it is the exact reverse which is the case. As\r\n     a net result of the whole thing Germany was, ten years after\r\n     the war, a good deal worse off, financially, than her\r\n     vanquished rival, and was at that date trying, as she is trying\r\n     to-day, to borrow money from her victim. Within twenty months\r\n     of the payment of the last of the indemnity, the bank rate was\r\n     higher in Berlin than in Paris, and we know that Bismarck's\r\n     later life was clouded by the spectacle of what he regarded as\r\n     an absurd miracle: the vanquished recovering more quickly than\r\n     the victor. We have the testimony of his own speeches to this\r\n     fact, and to the fact that France weathered the financial\r\n     storms of 1878-9 a great deal better than did Germany. And\r\n     to-day, when Germany is compelled to pay nearly 4 per cent. for\r\n     money, France can secure it for 3.... We are not for the moment\r\n     considering anything but the money view--the advantages and\r\n     disadvantages of a certain financial operation--and by any test\r\n     that you care to apply, France, the vanquished, is better off\r\n     than Germany, the victor. The French people are as a whole more\r\n     prosperous, more comfortable, more economically secure, with\r\n     greater reserve of savings and all the moral and social\r\n     advantages that go therewith, than are the Germans, a fact\r\n     expressed briefly by French Rentes standing at 98 and German\r\n     Consols at 83. There is something wrong with a financial\r\n     operation that gives these results.\r\n\r\nThe something wrong, of course, is that in order to arrive at any\r\nfinancial profit at all essential facts have to be disregarded, those\r\nfacts being what necessarily precedes and what necessarily follows a war\r\nof this kind. In the case of highly organized industrial nations like\r\nEngland and Germany, dependent for the very livelihood of great masses\r\nof their population upon the fact that neighboring nations furnish a\r\nmarket for their goods, a general policy of \"piracy,\" imposing upon\r\nthose neighbors an expenditure which limits their purchasing power,\r\ncreates a burden of which the nation responsible for that policy of\r\npiracy pays its part. It is not France alone which has paid the greater\r\npart of the real cost of the Franco-German War, it is Europe--and\r\nparticularly Germany--in the burdensome military system and the general\r\npolitical situation which that war has created or intensified.\r\n\r\nBut there is a more special consideration connected with the exaction of\r\nan indemnity, which demands notice, and that is the practical difficulty\r\nwith regard to the transfer of an immense sum of money outside the\r\nordinary operations of commerce.\r\n\r\nThe history of the German experience with the French indemnity suggests\r\nthe question whether in every case an enormous discount on the nominal\r\nvalue of a large money indemnity must not be allowed owing to the\r\npractical financial difficulties of its payment and receipt,\r\ndifficulties unavoidable in any circumstances which we need consider.\r\n\r\nThese difficulties were clearly foreseen by Sir Robert Giffen, though\r\nhis warnings, and the important reservations that he made on this point,\r\nare generally overlooked by those who wish to make use of his\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nThese warnings he summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n     As regards Germany, a doubt is expressed whether the Germans\r\n     will gain so much as France loses, the capital of the indemnity\r\n     being transferred from individuals to the German Government,\r\n     who cannot use it so profitably as individuals. It is doubted\r\n     whether the practice of lending out large sums, though a\r\n     preferable course to locking them up, will not in the end be\r\n     injurious.\r\n\r\n     The financial operations incidental to these great losses and\r\n     expenses seriously affect the money market. They have been a\r\n     fruitful cause, in the first place, of spasmodic disturbance.\r\n     The outbreak of war caused a monetary panic in July, 1870, by\r\n     the anxiety of people who had money engagements to meet to\r\n     provide against the chances of war, and there was another\r\n     monetary crash in September, 1871, owing to the sudden\r\n     withdrawal by the German Government of the money it had to\r\n     receive. The war thus illustrates the tendency of wars in\r\n     general to cause spasmodic disturbance in a market so\r\n     delicately organized as that of London now is.\r\n\r\nAnd it is to be noted in this connection that the difficulties of 1872\r\nwere trifling compared to what they would necessarily be in our day. In\r\n1872, Germany was self-sufficing, little dependent upon credit; to-day\r\nundisturbed credit in Europe is the very life-blood of her industry; it\r\nis, in fact, the very food of her people, as the events of 1911 have\r\nsufficiently proved.\r\n\r\nIt is not generally realized how abundantly the whole history of the\r\nGerman indemnity bears out Sir Robert Giffen's warning; how this flood\r\nof gold turned indeed to dust and ashes as far as the German nation is\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nFirst, anyone familiar with financial problems might have expected that\r\nthe receipt of so large a sum of money by Germany would cause prices to\r\nrise and so handicap export trade in competition with France, where the\r\nreverse process would cause prices to fall. This result was, in fact,\r\nproduced. M. Paul Beaulieu and M. Leon Say[19] have both shown that this\r\nfactor operated through the value of commercial bills of exchange,\r\ngiving to the French exporter a bonus and to the German a handicap which\r\naffected trade most perceptibly. Captain Bernard Serrigny, who has\r\ncollected in his work a wealth of evidence bearing on this subject,\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n     The rise in prices influenced seriously the cost of production,\r\n     and the German manufacturers fought, in consequence, at a\r\n     disadvantage with England and France. Finally the goods\r\n     produced at this high cost were thrown upon the home market at\r\n     the moment when the increase in the cost of living was\r\n     diminishing seriously the purchasing power of the bulk of\r\n     consumers. These goods had to compete, not only with home\r\n     over-production due to the failure to sell abroad, but with\r\n     foreign goods, which, despite the tariff, were by their lower\r\n     price able to push their way into the German market, where\r\n     relatively higher prices attracted them. In this competition\r\n     France was particularly prominent. In France the lack of\r\n     metallic money had engendered great financial caution, and had\r\n     considerably lowered prices all around, so that there was a\r\n     general financial and commercial condition very different from\r\n     that in Germany, where the payment of the indemnity had been\r\n     followed by reckless speculation. Moreover, owing to the heavy\r\n     foreign payments made by France, bills drawn on foreign centres\r\n     were at a premium, a premium which constituted a sensible\r\n     additional profit to French exporters, so considerable in\r\n     certain cases that it was worth while for French manufacturers\r\n     to sell their goods at an actual loss in order to realize the\r\n     profit on the bill of exchange. The German market was thus\r\n     being captured by the French at the very moment when the\r\n     Germans supposed they would, thanks to the indemnity, be\r\n     starting out to capture the world.\r\n\r\nThe German economist Max Wirth (\"Geschichte der Handelskrisen\")\r\nexpressed in 1874 his astonishment at France's financial and industrial\r\nrecovery: \"The most striking example of the economic force of the\r\ncountry is shown by the exports, which rose immediately after the\r\nsignature of peace, despite a war which swallowed a hundred thousand\r\nlives and more than ten milliards (two billion dollars).\" A similar\r\nconclusion is drawn by Professor Biermer (\"Fuerst Bismarck als\r\nVolkswirt\"), who indicates that the Protectionist movement in 1879 was\r\nto a large extent due to the result of the payment of the indemnity.\r\n\r\nThis disturbance of the balance of trade, however, was only one factor\r\namong several: the financial disorganization, a fictitious expansion of\r\nexpenditure creating a morbid speculation, precipitated the worst\r\nfinancial crisis in Germany which she has known in modern times.\r\nMonsieur Lavisse summarizes the experience thus:\r\n\r\n     Enormous sums of money were lost. If one takes the aggregate of\r\n     the securities quoted on the Berlin Bourse, railroad, mining\r\n     and industrial securities generally, it is by thousands of\r\n     millions of marks that one must estimate the value of such\r\n     securities in 1870 and 1871. But a large number of enterprises\r\n     were started in Germany of which the Berlin Bourse knew\r\n     nothing. Cologne, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Leipzig, Breslau,\r\n     Stuttgart, had all their local groups of speculative\r\n     securities; hundreds of millions must be added to the thousands\r\n     of millions. These differences did not represent merely a\r\n     transfer of wealth, for a great proportion of the capital sunk\r\n     was lost altogether, having been eaten up in ill-considered and\r\n     unattractive expenditure.... There can be no sort of doubt that\r\n     the money lost in these worthless enterprises constitutes an\r\n     absolute loss for Germany.\r\n\r\nThe decade from 1870-1880 was for France a great recuperative period,\r\nalthough for several other nations in Europe it was one of great\r\ndepression, notably, after the \"boom\" of 1872, for Germany. No less an\r\nauthority than Bismarck himself testifies to the double fact. We know\r\nthat Bismarck was astonished and dismayed by seeing the regeneration of\r\nFrance after the war taking place more rapidly and more completely than\r\nthe regeneration of Germany. This weighed so heavily upon his mind that\r\nin introducing his Protectionist Bill in 1879 he declared that Germany\r\nwas \"slowly bleeding to death,\" and that if the present process were\r\ncontinued she would find herself ruined. Speaking in the Reichstag on\r\nMay 2, 1879, he said:\r\n\r\n     We see that France manages to support the present difficult\r\n     business situation of the civilized world better than we do;\r\n     that her Budget has increased since 1871 by a milliard and a\r\n     half, and that thanks not only to loans; we see that she has\r\n     more resources than Germany, and that, in short, over there\r\n     they complain less of bad times.\r\n\r\nAnd in a speech two years later (November 29, 1881) he returned to the\r\nsame idea:\r\n\r\n     It was towards 1877 that I was first struck with the general\r\n     and growing distress in Germany as compared with France. I saw\r\n     furnaces banked, the standard of well-being reduced, and the\r\n     general position of workmen becoming worse and business as a\r\n     whole terribly bad.\r\n\r\nIn the book from which these extracts are taken[20] the author writes as\r\nan introduction to Bismarck's speeches:\r\n\r\n     Trade and industry were in a miserable condition. Thousands of\r\n     workmen were without employment, and in the winter of 1876-77\r\n     unemployment took great proportions, and soup-kitchens and\r\n     State workshops had to be established.\r\n\r\nEvery author who deals with this period seems to tell broadly the same\r\ntale, however much they may differ in detail. \"If only we could get back\r\nto the general position of things before the war,\" said M. Block in\r\n1879. \"But salaries diminish and prices go up.\"[21]\r\n\r\nAt the very time that the French millions were raining in upon Germany\r\n(1873) she was suffering from a grave financial crisis, and so little\r\neffect did the transfer of the money have upon trade and finance in\r\ngeneral, that twelve months after the payment of the last of the\r\nindemnity we find the bank rate higher in Berlin than in Paris; and, as\r\nwas shown by the German economist Soetbeer, by the year 1878 far more\r\nmoney was in circulation in France than in Germany.[22] Hans Blum,\r\nindeed, directly ascribed the series of crises between the years 1873\r\nand 1880 to the indemnity: \"A burst of prosperity and then ruin for\r\nthousands.\"[23] Throughout the year 1875 the bank rate in Paris was\r\nuniformly 3 per cent. In Berlin (Preussische Bank, which preceded the\r\nReichs Bank) it varied from 4 to 6 per cent. A similar difference is\r\nreflected by the fact that, between the years 1872 and 1877, the\r\ndeposits in the State savings banks in Germany actually fell by roughly\r\n20 per cent., while in the same period the French deposits _increased_\r\nabout 20 per cent.\r\n\r\nTwo tendencies plainly show the condition of Germany during the decade\r\nwhich followed the war: the enormous growth of Socialism--relatively\r\nmuch greater than any which we have ever since seen--and the immense\r\nstimulus given to emigration.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no thesis is commoner with the defender of war than this: that,\r\nthough one may not be able in a narrow economic sense to justify an\r\nenterprise like that of 1870, the moral stimulus which victory gave to\r\nthe German people is accepted as being of incalculable benefit to the\r\nrace and the nation. Its alleged effect in bringing about a national\r\nsolidarity, in stimulating patriotic sentiment and national pride, in\r\nthe wiping out of internal differences and Heaven knows what, are claims\r\nI have dealt with at greater length elsewhere, and I wish only to note\r\nhere that all this high-falutin does not stand the test of facts. The\r\ntwo phenomena just mentioned--the extraordinary progress of Socialism\r\nand the enormous stimulus given to emigration during the years which\r\nimmediately followed the war--give the lie to all the claims in\r\nquestion. In 1872-73, the very years in which the moral stimulus of\r\nvictory and the economic stimulus of the indemnity should have kept at\r\nhome every able-bodied German, emigration was, relatively to the\r\npopulation, greater than it has ever been before or since, the figures\r\nfor 1872 being 154,000 and for 1873 134,000.[24] And at no period since\r\nthe fifties was the internal political struggle so bitter--it was a\r\nperiod of repression, of prescription on the one side and class-hatred\r\non the other--\"the golden age of the drill-sergeant,\" some German has\r\ncalled it.\r\n\r\nIt will be replied that, after the first decade, Germany's trade has\r\nshown an expansion which has not been shown by that of France. Those who\r\nare hypnotized by this, quietly ignore altogether one great fact or\r\nwhich has affected both France and Germany, not only since the war, but\r\nduring the whole of the nineteenth century, and that factor is that the\r\npopulation of France, from causes in no way connected with the\r\nFranco-Prussian War, since the tendency was a pronounced one for fifty\r\nyears before, is practically quite stationary; while the population of\r\nGermany, also for reasons in no way connected with the war, since the\r\ntendency was also pronounced half a century previously, has shown an\r\nabounding expansion. Since 1875 the population of Germany has increased\r\nby twenty million souls. That of France has not increased at all. Is it\r\nastonishing that the labor of twenty million souls makes some stir in\r\nthe industrial world? Is it not evident that the necessity of earning a\r\nlivelihood for this increasing population gives to German industry an\r\nexpansion outside the limits of her territory which cannot be looked for\r\nin the case of a nation whose social energies are not faced with any\r\nsuch problem? There is this, moreover, to be borne in mind: Germany has\r\nsecured her foreign trade on what are, in the terms of the relative\r\ncomfort of her people, hard conditions. In other words, she has secured\r\nthat trade by cutting profits, in the way that a business fighting\r\ndesperately for life will cut profits, in order to secure orders, and by\r\nmaking sacrifices that the comfortable business man will not make.\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that France has made no sensational splash in\r\nforeign trade since the war, the standard of comfort among her people\r\nhas been rising steadily, and is without doubt generally higher to-day\r\nthan is that of the German people. This higher standard of comfort is\r\nreflected in her financial situation. It is Germany, the victor, which\r\nis to-day in the position of a suppliant in regard to France, and it is\r\nrevealing no diplomatic secrets to say that, for many years now, Germany\r\nhas been employing all the wiles of her diplomacy to obtain the official\r\nrecognition of German securities on the French Bourses. France\r\nfinancially has, in a very real sense, the whip hand.\r\n\r\nThat is not all. Those who point triumphantly to German industrial\r\nexpansion, as a proof of the benefits of war and conquest, ignore\r\ncertain facts which cannot be ignored if that argument is to have any\r\nvalue, and they are these:\r\n\r\n1. Such progress is not peculiar to Germany; it is shown in an equal or\r\ngreater degree (I am speaking now of the general wealth and social\r\nprogress of the average individual citizen) by States that have had no\r\nvictorious war--the Scandinavian States, the Netherlands, Switzerland.\r\n\r\n2. Even if it were special to Germany, which it is not, we should be\r\nentitled to ask whether certain developments of German political\r\nevolution, which _preceded the war_, and which one may fairly claim have\r\na more direct and understandable bearing upon industrial progress, are\r\nnot a much more appreciable factor in that progress than the war\r\nitself--I refer particularly, of course, to the immense change involved\r\nin the fiscal union of the German States, which was completed before the\r\nFranco-German War of 1870 had been declared; to say nothing of such\r\nother factors as the invention of the Thomas-Gilchrist process which\r\nenabled the phosphoric iron ores of Germany, previously useless, to be\r\nutilized.\r\n\r\n3. The very serious social difficulties (which have, of course, their\r\neconomic aspect) that _do_ confront the German people--the intense class\r\nfriction, the backwardness of parliamentary government, the survival of\r\nreactionary political ideas, wrapped up with the domination of the\r\n\"Prussian ideal\"--all difficulties which States whose political\r\ndevelopment has been less marked by successful war (the lesser European\r\nStates just mentioned, for instance)--are not faced with in the same\r\ndegree. These difficulties, special, among the great European nations,\r\nto Germany, are certainly in a large measure a legacy of the\r\nFranco-German War, a part of the general system to which that war gave\r\nrise, the general character of the political union which it provoked.\r\n\r\nThe general ascription of such real progress as Germany has made to the\r\neffects of the war and nothing else--a conclusion which calmly ignores\r\nfactors which have evidently a more direct bearing--is one of those _a\r\npriori_ judgments repeated, parrot fashion, without investigation or\r\ncare even by publicists of repute; it is characteristic of the\r\ncarelessness which dominates this whole subject. This more general\r\nconsideration, which does not properly belong to the special problem of\r\nan indemnity, I have dealt with at greater length in the next section.\r\nThe evidence bearing on the particular question, as to whether in\r\npractice the exaction of a large monetary indemnity from a conquered foe\r\ncan ever be economically profitable or of real advantage to the\r\nconqueror, is of a simpler character. If we put the question in this\r\nform, \"Was the receipt of the indemnity, in the most characteristic and\r\nsuccessful case in history, of advantage to the conqueror?\" the reply is\r\nsimple enough: all the evidence plainly and conclusively shows that it\r\nwas of no advantage; that the conqueror would probably have been better\r\nwithout it.\r\n\r\nEven if we draw from that evidence a contrary conclusion, even if we\r\nconclude that the actual payment of the indemnity was as beneficial as\r\nall the evidence would seem to show it was mischievous; even if we could\r\nset aside completely the financial and commercial difficulties which its\r\npayment seems to have involved; if we ascribe to other causes the great\r\nfinancial crises which followed that payment; if we deduct no discount\r\nfrom the nominal value of the indemnity, but assume that every mark and\r\nthaler of it represented its full face value to Germany--even admitting\r\nall this, it is still inevitable that _the direct cost of preparing for\r\na war and of guarding against a subsequent war of retribution must, from\r\nthe nature of the case, exceed the value of the indemnity which can be\r\nexacted_. This is not merely a hypothetical statement, it is a\r\ncommercial fact, supported by evidence which is familiar to us all. In\r\norder to avoid repaying, with interest, the indemnity drawn from France,\r\nGermany has had to expend upon armaments a sum of money at least equal\r\nto that indemnity. In order to exact a still larger indemnity from\r\nGreat Britain, Germany would have to spend a still larger sum in\r\npreparations, and to guard against repayment would be led into\r\nindefinite expenditure, which has only to go on long enough inevitably\r\nto exceed the very definite indemnity. For, it must be remembered that\r\nthe amount of an indemnity extractable from a modern community, of the\r\ncredit era, has very definite limits: an insolvent community can pay\r\nmore. If the Statesmen of Europe could lay on one side, for a moment,\r\nthe irrelevant considerations which cloud their minds, they would see\r\nthat the direct cost of acquisition by force must in these circumstances\r\nnecessarily exceed in value the property acquired. When the _indirect_\r\ncosts are also considered, the balance of loss becomes incalculably\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\nThose who urge that through an indemnity, war can be made to \"pay\" (and\r\nit is for them that this chapter is written), have before them problems\r\nand difficulties--difficulties of not merely a military, but of a\r\nfinancial and social character--of the very deepest kind. It was\r\nprecisely in this section of the subject that German science failed in\r\n1870. There is no evidence that much progress has been made in the study\r\nof this phase of the problem by either side since the war--indeed, there\r\nis plenty of evidence that it has been neglected. It is time that it was\r\nscientifically and systematically attacked.\r\n\r\nThose who wish well for Europe will encourage the study, for it can have\r\nbut one result: to show that less and less can war be made to pay; that\r\nall those forces of our world which daily gain in strength make it, as\r\na commercial venture, more and more preposterous. The study of this\r\ndepartment of international polity will tend to the same result as the\r\nstudy of any of its facets: the undermining of those beliefs which have\r\nin the past so often led to, and are to-day so often claimed as the\r\nmotives likely to lead to, war between civilized peoples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nHOW COLONIES ARE OWNED\r\n\r\n    Why twentieth-century methods must differ from eighteenth--The\r\n    vagueness of our conceptions of statecraft--How Colonies are\r\n    \"owned\"--Some little recognized facts--Why foreigners could not\r\n    fight England for her self-governing Colonies--She does not \"own\"\r\n    them, since they are masters of their own destiny--The paradox\r\n    of conquest: England in a worse position in regard to her own\r\n    Colonies than in regard to foreign nations--Her experience as the\r\n    oldest and most practised colonizer in history--Recent French\r\n    experience--Could Germany hope to do what England cannot do?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing chapters dispose of the first six of the seven\r\npropositions outlined in Chapter III. There remains the seventh, dealing\r\nwith the notion that in some way England's security and prosperity would\r\nbe threatened by a foreign nation \"taking our Colonies from us\"--a thing\r\nwhich we are assured her rivals are burning to do, as it would involve\r\nthe \"breaking up of the British Empire\" to their advantage.\r\n\r\nLet us try to read some meaning into a phrase which, however childish it\r\nmay appear on analysis, is very commonly in the mouths of those who are\r\nresponsible for British political ideas.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is necessary to point out--as, indeed, it is in\r\nevery phase of this problem of the relationship of States--that the\r\nworld has moved, that methods have changed. It is hardly possible to\r\ndiscuss this matter of the necessary futility of military force in the\r\nmodern world for ten minutes without it being urged that as England has\r\nacquired her Colonies by the sword, it is evident that the sword may do\r\na like service for modern States desiring Colonies. About as reasonably\r\ncould one say that, as certain tribes and nations in the past enriched\r\nthemselves by capturing slaves and women among neighboring tribes, the\r\ndesire to capture slaves and women will always be an operative motive in\r\nwarfare between nations, as though slavery had not been put economically\r\nout of court by modern industrial methods, and as though the change in\r\nsocial methods had not put the forcible capture of women out of court.\r\n\r\nWhat was the problem confronting the merchant adventurer of the\r\nsixteenth century? There were newly-discovered foreign lands containing,\r\nas he believed, precious metals and stones and spices, and inhabited by\r\nsavages or semi-savages. If other traders got those stones, it was quite\r\nevident that he could not. His colonial policy, therefore, had to be\r\ndirected to two ends: first, such effective political occupation of the\r\ncountry that he could keep the savage or semi-savage population in\r\ncheck, and could exploit the territory for its wealth; and, secondly,\r\nsuch arrangements as would prevent other nations from searching for\r\nthis wealth in precious metals, spices, etc., since, if they obtained\r\nit, he could not.\r\n\r\nThat is the story of the French and Dutch in India, and of the Spanish\r\nin South America. But as soon as there grew up in those countries an\r\norganized community living in the country itself, the whole problem\r\nchanged. The Colonies, in this later stage of development, have a value\r\nto the Mother Country mainly as a market and a source of food and raw\r\nmaterial, and if their value in those respects is to be developed to the\r\nfull, they inevitably become self-governing communities in greater or\r\nless degree, and the Mother Country exploits them exactly as she\r\nexploits any other community with which she may be trading. Germany\r\nmight acquire Canada, but it could no longer be a question of her taking\r\nCanada's wealth in precious metals, or in any other form, to the\r\nexclusion of other nations. Could Germany \"own\" Canada, she would have\r\nto \"own\" it in the same way that Britain does; the Germans would have to\r\npay for every sack of wheat and every pound of beef that they might buy,\r\njust as though Canada \"belonged\" to England or to anybody else. Germany\r\ncould not have even the meagre satisfaction of Germanizing these great\r\ncommunities, for one knows that they are far too firmly \"set.\" Their\r\nlanguage, law, morals, would have to be, after German conquest, what\r\nthey are now. Germany would find that the German Canada was pretty much\r\nthe Canada that it is now--a country where Germans are free to go and\r\ndo go; a field for Germany's expanding population.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Germany feeds her expanding population from\r\nterritories like Canada and the United States and South America without\r\nsending its citizens there. The era of emigration from Germany has\r\nstopped, because the compound steam-engine has rendered emigration\r\nlargely unnecessary. And it is the developments which are the necessary\r\noutcome of such forces, that have made the whole colonial problem of the\r\ntwentieth century radically different from that of the eighteenth or\r\nseventeenth.\r\n\r\nI have stated the case thus: No nation could gain any advantage by the\r\nconquest of the British Colonies, and Great Britain could not suffer\r\nmaterial damage by their \"loss,\" however much this would be regretted on\r\nsentimental grounds, and as rendering less easy a certain useful social\r\nco-operation between kindred peoples. For the British Colonies are, in\r\nfact, independent nations in alliance with the Mother Country, to whom\r\nthey are no source of tribute or economic profit (except in the way that\r\nforeign nations are), their economic relations being settled not by the\r\nMother Country, but by the Colonies. Economically, England would gain by\r\ntheir formal separation, since she would be relieved of the cost of\r\ntheir defence. Their loss, involving, therefore, no change in economic\r\nfact (beyond saving the Mother Country the cost of their defence), could\r\nnot involve the ruin of the Empire and the starvation of the Mother\r\nCountry, as those who commonly treat of such a contingency are apt to\r\naver. As England is not able to exact tribute or economic advantage, it\r\nis inconceivable that any other country, necessarily less experienced in\r\ncolonial management, would be able to succeed where England had failed,\r\nespecially in view of the past history of the Spanish, Portuguese,\r\nFrench, and British Colonial Empires. This history also demonstrates\r\nthat the position of British Crown Colonies, in the respect which we are\r\nconsidering, is not sensibly different from that of the self-governing\r\nones. It is not to be presumed, therefore, that any European nation\r\nwould attempt the desperately expensive business of the conquest of\r\nEngland, for the purpose of making an experiment with her Colonies which\r\nall colonial history shows to be doomed to failure.\r\n\r\nWhat are the facts? Great Britain is the most successful colonizing\r\nnation in the world, and the policy into which her experience has driven\r\nher is that outlined by Sir C.P. Lucas, one of the greatest authorities\r\non colonial questions. He writes, speaking of the history of the British\r\nColonies on the American continent, thus:\r\n\r\n     It was seen--but it might not have been seen had the United\r\n     States not won their independence--that English colonists, like\r\n     Greek Colonies of old, go out on terms of being equal, not\r\n     subordinate, to those who are left behind; that when they have\r\n     effectively planted another and a distant land, they must,\r\n     within the widest limits, be left to rule themselves; that,\r\n     whether they are right, or whether they are wrong--more,\r\n     perhaps, when they are wrong than when they are right--they\r\n     cannot be made amenable by force; that mutual good feeling,\r\n     community of interest, and abstention from pressing rightful\r\n     claims to their logical conclusion, can alone hold together a\r\n     true Colonial Empire.\r\n\r\nBut what in the name of common sense is the advantage of conquering them\r\nif the only policy is to let them do as they like, \"whether they are\r\nright, or whether they are wrong--more, perhaps, when they are wrong\r\nthan when they are right\"? And what avails it to conquer them if they\r\ncannot be made amenable to force? Surely this makes the whole thing a\r\n_reductio ad absurdum_. Were a Power like Germany to use force to\r\nconquer Colonies, she would find out that they were not amenable to\r\nforce, and that the only working policy was to let them do exactly as\r\nthey did before she conquered them, and to allow them, if they\r\nchose--and many of the British Colonies do so choose--to treat the\r\nMother Country absolutely as a foreign country. There has recently been\r\ngoing on in Canada a discussion as to the position which that Dominion\r\nshould hold with reference to the British in the event of war, and\r\nthat discussion has made Canada's position quite plain. It has been\r\nsummarized thus: \"We must always be free to give or refuse support.\"[25]\r\n\r\nCould a foreign nation say more? In what sense does England \"own\" Canada\r\nwhen Canadians must always be free to give or refuse their military\r\nsupport to England; and in what way does Canada differ from a foreign\r\nnation while England may be at war when Canada can be at peace? Mr.\r\nAsquith formally endorses this conception.[26]\r\n\r\nThis shows clearly that no Dominion is held to be bound by virtue of its\r\nallegiance to the Sovereign of the British Empire to place its forces at\r\nhis disposition, no matter how real may be the emergency. If it should\r\nnot desire so to do, it is free to refuse so to do. This is to convert\r\nthe British Empire into a loose alliance of independent Sovereign\r\nStates, which are not even bound to help each other in case of war. The\r\nmilitary alliance between Austria and Germany is far more stringent than\r\nthe tie which unites, for purposes of war, the component parts of the\r\nBritish Empire.\r\n\r\nOne critic, commenting on this, says:\r\n\r\n     Whatever language is used to describe this new movement of\r\n     Imperial defence, it is virtually one more step towards\r\n     complete national independence on the part of the Colonies. For\r\n     not only will the consciousness of the assumption of this task\r\n     of self-defence feed with new vigor the spirit of nationality,\r\n     it will entail the further power of full control over foreign\r\n     relations. This has already been virtually admitted in the case\r\n     of Canada, now entitled to a determinant voice in all treaties\r\n     or other engagements in which her interests are especially\r\n     involved. The extension of this right to the other colonial\r\n     nations may be taken as a matter of course. Home rule in\r\n     national defence thus established reduces the Imperial\r\n     connection to its thinnest terms.[27]\r\n\r\nStill more significant, perhaps, is the following emphatic declaration\r\nfrom Mr. Balfour himself. Speaking in London, on November 6, 1911, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     We depend as an Empire upon the co-operation of absolutely\r\n     independent Parliaments. I am not talking as a lawyer; I am\r\n     talking as a politician. I believe from a legal point of view\r\n     that the British Parliament is supreme over the Parliament of\r\n     Canada or Australasia or the Cape or South Africa, but in fact\r\n     they are independent Parliaments, absolutely independent, and\r\n     it is our business to recognize that and to frame the British\r\n     Empire upon the co-operation of absolutely independent\r\n     Parliaments.[28]\r\n\r\nWhich means, of course, that England's position with regard to Canada\r\nor Australia is just England's position with regard to any other\r\nindependent State; that she has no more \"ownership\" in Australia than\r\nshe has in Argentina. Indeed, facts of very recent English history have\r\nestablished quite incontrovertibly this ridiculous paradox: England has\r\nmore influence--that is to say, a freer opportunity of enforcing her\r\npoint of view--with foreign nations than with her own Colonies. Indeed,\r\ndoes not Sir C. P. Lucas's statement that \"whether they are right or\r\nwrong--still more, perhaps, when they are wrong,\" they must be left\r\nalone, necessarily mean that her position with the Colonies is weaker\r\nthan her position with foreign nations? In the present state of\r\ninternational feeling an English Statesman would never dream of\r\nadvocating that she should submit to foreign nations when they are\r\nwrong. Recent history is illuminating on this point.\r\n\r\nWhat were the larger motives that pushed England into war with the Dutch\r\nRepublics? To vindicate the supremacy of the British race in South\r\nAfrica, to enforce British ideals as against Boer ideals, to secure the\r\nrights of British Indians and other British subjects, to protect the\r\nnative against Boer oppression, to take the government of the country\r\ngenerally from a people whom, at that date, she was apt to describe as\r\n\"inherently incapable of civilization.\" What, however, is the outcome of\r\nspending a billion and a quarter of dollars upon the accomplishment of\r\nthese objects? The present Government of the Transvaal is in the hands\r\nof the Boer party.[29] England has achieved the union of South Africa in\r\nwhich the Boer element is predominant. Britain has enforced against the\r\nBritish Indian in the Transvaal and Natal the same Boer regulations\r\nwhich were one of her grievances before the war, and the Houses of\r\nParliament have ratified an Act of Union in which the Boer attitude with\r\nreference to the native is codified and made permanent. Sir Charles\r\nDilke, in the debate in the House of Commons on the South African Bill,\r\nmade this quite clear. He said: \"The old British principle in South\r\nAfrica, as distinct from the Boer principle, in regard to the treatment\r\nof natives, was equal rights for all civilized men. At the beginning of\r\nthe South African War the country was told that one of its main objects,\r\nand certainly that the one predominant factor in any treaty of peace,\r\nwould be the assertion of the British principle as against the Boer\r\nprinciple. Now the Boer principle dominates throughout the whole of\r\nSouth Africa.\" Mr. Asquith, as representing the British Government,\r\nadmitted that this was the case, and that \"the opinion of this country\r\nis almost unanimous in objecting to the color bar in the Union\r\nParliament.\" He went on to say that \"the opinion of the British\r\nGovernment and the opinion of the British people must not be allowed to\r\nlead to any interference with a self-governing Colony.\" So that, having\r\nexpended in the conquest of the Transvaal a greater sum than Germany\r\nexacted from France at the close of the Franco-Prussian War, England has\r\nnot even the right to enforce her views on those whose contrary views\r\nwere the _casus belli_!\r\n\r\nA year or two since there was in London a deputation from the British\r\nIndians in the Transvaal pointing out that the regulations there deprive\r\nthem of the ordinary rights of British citizens. The British Government\r\ninformed them that the Transvaal being a self-governing Colony, the\r\nImperial Government could do nothing for them.[30] Now, it will not be\r\nforgotten that, at a time when Britain was quarrelling with Paul Krueger,\r\none of the liveliest of her grievances was the treatment of British\r\nIndians. Having conquered Krueger, and now \"owning\" his country, do the\r\nBritish themselves act as they were trying to compel Paul Krueger as a\r\nforeign ruler to act? They do not. They (or rather the responsible\r\nGovernment of the Colony, with whom they dare not interfere, although\r\nthey were ready enough to make representations to Krueger) simply and\r\npurely enforce his own regulations. Moreover, the Australian\r\nCommonwealth and British Columbia have since taken the view with\r\nreference to British Indians which President Krueger took, and which view\r\nEngland made almost a _casus belli_. Yet in the case of her Colonies she\r\ndoes absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\nSo the process is this: The Government of a foreign territory does\r\nsomething which we ask it to cease doing. The refusal of the foreign\r\nGovernment constitutes a _casus belli_. We fight, we conquer, and the\r\nterritory in question becomes one of our Colonies, and we allow the\r\nGovernment of that Colony to continue doing the very thing which\r\nconstituted, in the case of a foreign nation, a _casus belli_.\r\n\r\nDo we not, taking the English case as typical, arrive, therefore, at the\r\nabsurdity I have already indicated--_that we are in a worse position to\r\nenforce our views in our own territory--that is to say, in our\r\nColonies--than in foreign territory_?\r\n\r\nWould England submit tamely if a foreign Government should exercise\r\npermanently gross oppression on an important section of her citizens?\r\nCertainly she would not. But when the Government exercising that\r\noppression happens to be the Government of her own Colonies she does\r\nnothing, and a great British authority lays it down that, even more\r\nwhen the Colonial Government is wrong than when it is right, must she do\r\nnothing, and that, though wrong, the Colonial Government cannot be\r\namenable to force. Nor can it be said that Crown Colonies differ\r\nessentially in this matter from self-governing dominions. Not only is\r\nthere an irresistible tendency for Crown Colonies to acquire the\r\npractical rights of self-governing dominions, but it has become a\r\npractical impossibility to disregard their special interests. Experience\r\nis conclusive on this point.\r\n\r\nI am not here playing with words or attempting to make paradoxes. This\r\n_reductio ad absurdum_--the fact that when she owns a territory she\r\nrenounces the privilege of using force to ensure observance of her\r\nviews--is becoming more and more a commonplace of British colonial\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nAs to the fiscal position of the Colonies, that is precisely what their\r\npolitical relation is in all but name; they are foreign nations. They\r\nerect tariffs against Great Britain; they exclude large sections of\r\nBritish subjects absolutely (practically speaking, no British Indian is\r\nallowed to set foot in Australia, and yet British India constitutes the\r\ngreater part of the British Empire), and even against British subjects\r\nfrom Great Britain vexatious exclusion laws are enacted. Again the\r\nquestion arises: Could a foreign country do more? If fiscal preference\r\nis extended to Great Britain, that preference is not the result of\r\nBritish \"ownership\" of the Colonies, but is the free act of the colonial\r\nlegislators, and could as well be made by any foreign nation desiring\r\nto court closer fiscal relations with Great Britain.[31]\r\n\r\nIs it conceivable that Germany, if the real relations between Great\r\nBritain and her Colonies were understood, would undertake the costliest\r\nwar of conquest in history in order to acquire an absurd and profitless\r\nposition from which she could not exact even the shadow of a material\r\nadvantage?\r\n\r\nIt may be pleaded that Germany might on the morrow of conquest attempt\r\nto enforce a policy which gave her a material advantage in the Colonies,\r\nsuch as Spain and Portugal attempted to create for themselves. But in\r\nthat case, is it conceivable that Germany, without colonial experience,\r\nwould be able to enforce a policy which Great Britain was obliged to\r\nabandon a hundred years ago? Is it imaginable that, if Great Britain has\r\nbeen utterly unable to carry out a policy by which the Colonies shall\r\npay anything resembling tribute to the Mother Country, Germany, without\r\nexperience, and at an enormous disadvantage in the matter of language,\r\ntradition, racial tie, and the rest, would be able to make such a policy\r\na success? Surely, if the elements of this question were in the least\r\nunderstood in Germany, such a preposterous notion could not be\r\nentertained for a moment.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone seriously pretend that the present system of British\r\nColony-holding is due to British philanthropy or high-mindedness? We all\r\nknow, of course, that it is simply due to the fact that the older system\r\nof exploitation by monopoly broke down. It was a complete social,\r\ncommercial, and political failure long before it was abolished by law.\r\nIf England had persisted in the use of force to impose a disadvantageous\r\nsituation on the Colonies, she would have followed in the trail of\r\nSpain, Portugal, and France, and she would have lost her Colonies, and\r\nher Empire would have broken up.\r\n\r\nIt took England anything from two to three centuries to learn the real\r\ncolonial policy, but it would not take so long in our day for a\r\nconqueror to realize the only situation possible between one great\r\ncommunity and another. European history, indeed, has recently furnished\r\na striking illustration of how the forces which compel the relationship,\r\nwhich England has adopted towards her Colonies, are operative, even in\r\nthe case of quite small Colonies, which could not be termed \"great\r\ncommunities.\" Under the Meline regime in France, less than twenty years\r\nago, a highly Protectionist policy, somewhat corresponding to the old\r\nEnglish colonial monopoly system, was enforced in the case of certain\r\nFrench Colonies. None of these Colonies was very considerable--indeed,\r\nthey were all quite small--and yet the forces which they represented in\r\nthe matter of the life of France have sufficed to change radically the\r\nattitude of the French Government in the matter of the policy which less\r\nthan twenty years ago was imposed on them. In _Le Temps_ of April 5,\r\n1911, appeared the following:\r\n\r\n     Our Colonies can consider yesterday a red-letter day. The\r\n     debate in the Chamber gives hope that the stifling fiscal\r\n     policy imposed on them heretofore is about to be very greatly\r\n     modified. The Tariff Commission of the Chamber has hitherto\r\n     been a very citadel of the blindest type of Protectionism in\r\n     this matter. M. Thierry is the present President of this\r\n     Commission, and yet it is from him that we learn that a new era\r\n     in the Colonies is about to be inaugurated. It is a very great\r\n     change, and one that may have incalculable consequences in the\r\n     future development of our Colonial Empire.\r\n\r\n     The Customs Law of 1892 committed two injustices with regard to\r\n     our possessions. The first was that it obliged the Colonies to\r\n     receive, free of duty, goods coming from France, while it taxed\r\n     colonial goods coming into France. Now, it is impossible to\r\n     imagine a treaty of that kind being passed between two free\r\n     countries, and if it was passed with the Colonies, it was\r\n     because these Colonies were weak, and not in the position to\r\n     defend themselves _vis-a-vis_ the Mother Country.... The\r\n     Minister of the Colonies himself, animated by a newer and\r\n     better spirit, which we are so happy to see appear in our\r\n     treatment of colonial questions, has promised to give all his\r\n     efforts towards terminating the present bad system.\r\n\r\n     A further defect of the law of 1892 is that all the Colonies\r\n     have been subjected to the same fiscal arrangement, as though\r\n     there could be anything in common between countries separated\r\n     by the width of the whole globe. Happily the policy was too\r\n     outrageous ever to be put into full execution. Certain of our\r\n     African Colonies[32] were tied by international treaties at the\r\n     time that the law was voted, so that the Government was\r\n     compelled to make exceptions. But Monsieur Meline's idea at\r\n     this period was to bring all the Colonies under one fiscal\r\n     arrangement imposed by the Mother Country, just as soon as the\r\n     international treaty should have expired. The exceptions have\r\n     thus furnished a most useful demonstration as to the results\r\n     which flow from the two systems; the fiscal policy imposed by\r\n     the Mother Country in view merely of its own immediate\r\n     interest, and the fiscal policy framed to some extent by the\r\n     Colony in view of its own special interests. Well, what is the\r\n     result? It is this. That those Colonies which have been free to\r\n     frame their own fiscal policy have enjoyed undeniable\r\n     prosperity, while those which have been obliged to submit to\r\n     the policy imposed by another country have been sinking into a\r\n     condition of veritable ruin; they are faced by positive\r\n     disaster! Only one conclusion is possible. Each Colony must be\r\n     free to make those arrangements which in its view are suited to\r\n     its local conditions. That is not at all what M. Meline\r\n     desired, but it is what experience imposes.... It is not merely\r\n     a matter of injustice. Our policy has been absurd. What is it\r\n     that France desires in her Colonies? An addition of wealth and\r\n     power to the Mother Country. But if we compel the Colonies to\r\n     submit to disadvantageous fiscal arrangements, which result in\r\n     their poverty, how can they possibly be a source of wealth and\r\n     power to the Mother Country? A Colony which can sell nothing is\r\n     a Colony which can buy nothing: it is a customer lost to French\r\n     industry.\r\n\r\nEvery feature of the foregoing is significant and pregnant: this change\r\nof policy is not taking place because France is unable to impose\r\nforce--she is perfectly able to do so; speaking in practical terms, the\r\nColonies have no physical force whatever to oppose to her--but this\r\nchange is taking place because the imposition of force, even when\r\ncompletely successful and unchallenged, is economically futile. The\r\nobject at which France is striving can be obtained in one way only: by\r\nan arrangement which is mutually advantageous, arrived at by the free\r\nconsent of both parties, the establishment of a relationship which\r\nplaces a Colony fiscally, economically, on the footing of a foreign\r\ncountry. France is now in process of doing exactly what England has done\r\nin the case of her Colonies: she is undoing the work of conquest,\r\nsurrendering bit by bit the right to impose force, because force fails\r\nin its object.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most significant feature of all in the French experience is\r\nthis: that it has taken less than twenty years for the old colonial\r\nsystem, even in the case of small and relatively powerless Colonies, to\r\nbreak down entirely. How long would a Power like Germany be able to\r\nimpose the old policy of exploitation on great and powerful communities,\r\na hundred times greater than the French Colonies, even supposing that\r\nshe could ever \"conquer\" them?[33]\r\n\r\nYet so little is the real relationship of modern Colonies understood,\r\nthat I have heard it mentioned in private conversation by an English\r\npublic man, whose position was such, moreover, as to enable him to give\r\nvery great effect to his opinion, that one of the motives pushing\r\nGermany to war was the projected capture of South Africa, in order to\r\nseize the gold-mines, and by means of a tax of 50 per cent. on their\r\noutput, secure for herself one of the chief sources of gold in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nOne heard a good deal at the outbreak of the South African War of the\r\npart that the gold-mines played in precipitating that conflict. Alike in\r\nEngland and on the Continent, it was generally assumed that Great\r\nBritain was \"after the gold-mines.\" A long correspondence took place in\r\nthe London _Times_ as to the real value of the mines, and speculation as\r\nto the amount of money which it was worth Great Britain's while to spend\r\nin their \"capture.\" Well, now that England has won the war, how many\r\ngold-mines has she captured? In other words, how many shares in the\r\ngold-mines does the British Government hold? How many mines have been\r\ntransferred from their then owners to the British Government, as the\r\nresult of British victory? How much tribute does the Government of\r\nWestminster exact as the result of investing two hundred and fifty\r\nmillions in the enterprise?\r\n\r\nThe fact is, of course, that the British Government does not hold a\r\ncent's worth of the property. The mines belong to the shareholders and\r\nto no one else, and in the conditions of the modern world it is not\r\npossible for a Government to \"capture\" so much as a single dollar's\r\nworth of such property as the result of a war of conquest.\r\n\r\nSupposing that Germany or any other conqueror were to put on the output\r\nof the mines a duty of 50 per cent. What would she get, and what would\r\nbe the result? The output of the South African mines to-day is, roughly,\r\n$150,000,000 a year, so that she would get about $75,000,000 a year.[34]\r\nThe annual total income of Germany is calculated at something like\r\n$15,000,000,000, so that a tribute of $75,000,000 would hold about the\r\nsame proportion to Germany's total income that, say, fifteen cents a day\r\nwould to a man in receipt of $10,000 a year. It would represent, say,\r\nthe expenditure of a man with an income of $2000 or $2500 a year upon,\r\nsay, his evening cigars. Could one imagine such a householder in his\r\nright mind committing burglary and murder in order to economize a dollar\r\na week? Yet that would be the position of the German Empire entering\r\nupon a great and costly war for the purpose of exacting $75,000,000 a\r\nyear from the South African mines; or, rather, the situation for the\r\nGerman Empire would be a great deal worse than that. For this\r\nhouseholder having committed burglary and murder for the sake of his\r\ndollar a week (the German Empire, that is, having entered into one of\r\nthe most frightful wars of history to exact its tribute of seventy-five\r\nmillions) would then find that in order to get this dollar he had to\r\njeopardize many of the investments upon which the bulk of his income\r\ndepended. On the morrow of imposing a tax of fifty per cent. on the\r\nmines there would be such a slump in a class of security now dealt in by\r\nevery considerable stock exchange in the world that there would hardly\r\nbe a considerable business firm in Europe unaffected thereby. In\r\nEngland, they know of the difficulty that a relatively mild fiscal\r\nattack, delivered rather for social and moral than economic reasons,\r\nupon a class of property like the brewing trade provokes. What sort of\r\noutcry, therefore, would be raised throughout the world when every South\r\nAfrican mining share in the world lost at one stroke half its value, and\r\na great many of them lost all their value? Who would invest money in the\r\nTransvaal at all if property were to be subject to that sort of shock?\r\nInvestors would argue that though it be mines to-day, it might be other\r\nforms of property to-morrow, and South Africa would find herself in the\r\nposition of being able hardly to borrow a quarter for any purpose\r\nwhatsoever, save at usurious and extortionate rates of interest. The\r\nwhole of South African trade and industry would, of course, feel the\r\neffect, and South Africa as a market would immediately begin to dwindle\r\nin importance. Those businesses bound up with South African affairs\r\nwould border on the brink of ruin, and many of them topple over. Is that\r\nthe way efficient Germany would set about the development of her\r\nnewly-acquired Empire? She would soon find that she had a ruined Colony\r\non her hands. If in South Africa the sturdy Dutch and English stock did\r\nnot produce a George Washington with a better material and moral case\r\nfor independence than George Washington ever had, then history has no\r\nmeaning. If it costs England a billion and a quarter to conquer Dutch\r\nSouth Africa, what would it cost Germany to conquer Anglo-Dutch South\r\nAfrica? Such a policy could not, of course, last six months, and Germany\r\nwould end by doing what Great Britain has ended by doing--she would\r\nrenounce all attempt to exact a tribute or commercial advantage other\r\nthan that which is the result of free co-operation with the South\r\nAfrican people. In other words, she would learn that the policy which\r\nGreat Britain has adopted was not adopted by philanthropy, but in the\r\nhard school of bitter experience. Germany would see that the last word\r\nin colonial statesmanship is to exact nothing from your Colonies, and\r\nwhere the greatest colonial power of history has been unable to follow\r\nany other policy, a poor intruder in the art of colonial administration\r\nwould not be likely to prove more successful, and she, too, would find\r\nthat the only way to treat Colonies is to treat them as independent or\r\nforeign territories, and the only way to own them is to make no attempt\r\nat exercising any of the functions of ownership. All the reasons which\r\ngave force to this principle in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries\r\nhave been reinforced a hundredfold by the modern contrivances of credit\r\nand capital, quick communication, popular government, popular press, the\r\nconditions and cost of warfare--the whole weight, indeed, of modern\r\nprogress. It is not a question here of theorizing, of the erection of an\r\nelaborate thesis, nor is it a question of arguing what the relations of\r\nColonies ought to be. The differences between the Imperialist and the\r\nAnti-imperialist do not enter into the discussion at all. It is simply a\r\nquestion of what the unmistakable outstanding facts of experience have\r\ntaught, and we all know, Imperialists and their opponents alike, that\r\nwhatever the relations with the Colonies are to be, that relationship\r\nmust be fixed by the free consent of the Colonies, by their choice, not\r\nours. Sir J.R. Seeley notes in his book, \"The Expansion of England,\"\r\nthat because the early Spanish Colonies were in a true sense of the word\r\n\"possessions,\" Britons acquired the habit of talking of \"possessions\"\r\nand \"ownership,\" and their ideas of colonial policy were vitiated during\r\nthree centuries, simply by the fatal hypnotism of an incorrect word. Is\r\nit not time that we shook off the influence of those disastrous words?\r\nCanada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, are not \"possessions.\"\r\nThey are no more possessions than is Argentina or Brazil, and the nation\r\nwhich conquered England, which even captured London, would be hardly\r\nnearer to the conquest of Canada or Australia than if it happened to\r\noccupy Constantinople or St. Petersburg. Why, therefore, do we tolerate\r\nthe loose talk which assumes that the master of London is also master of\r\nMontreal, Vancouver, Cape Town, Johannesburg, Melbourne, and Sydney?\r\nHave we not had about enough of this ignorant chatter, which is\r\npersistently blind to the simplest and most elementary facts of the\r\ncase? And have not the English, of all people of the world, a most\r\ndirect interest in aiding the general realization of these truths in\r\nEurope? Would not that general realization add immensely to the security\r\nof their so-called Empire?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE FIGHT FOR \"THE PLACE IN THE SUN\"\r\n\r\n    How Germany really expands--Where her real Colonies are--How she\r\n    exploits without conquest--What is the difference between an army\r\n    and a police force?--The policing of the world--Germany's share of\r\n    it in the Near East.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the practical outcome of the situation which the facts detailed\r\nin the last chapter make plain? Must nations like Germany conclude that,\r\nbecause there can be no duplication of the fight for empty territory\r\nwhich took place between European nations in the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries, and because talk of the German conquest of British\r\nColonies is childish nonsense, Germany must therefore definitely\r\nsurrender any hope of expansion, and accept a secondary position because\r\nshe happens to have \"come too late into the world\"? Are Germans with all\r\ntheir activities and scientific thoroughness, and with such a lively\r\nsense of the difficulty of finding room in the world for the additional\r\nmillion of Germans every year quietly to accept the _status quo_?\r\n\r\nIf our thoughts were not so distorted by misleading political imagery,\r\nit is doubtful whether it would ever occur to us that such a \"problem\"\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\nWhen one nation, say England, occupies a territory, does it mean that\r\nthat territory is \"lost\" to Germans? We know this to be an absurdity.\r\nGermany does an enormous and increasing trade with the territory that\r\nhas been pre-empted by the Anglo-Saxon race. Millions of Germans in\r\nGermany gain their livelihood by virtue of German enterprise and German\r\nindustry in Anglo-Saxon countries--indeed, it is the bitter and growing\r\ncomplaint of Englishmen that they are being driven out of these\r\nterritories by the Germans; that where originally British shipping was\r\nuniversal in the East,[35] German shipping is now coming to occupy the\r\nprominent place; that the trade of whole territories which Englishmen\r\noriginally had to themselves is now being captured by Germans, and this\r\nnot merely where the fiscal arrangements are more or less under the\r\ncontrol of the British Government, as in the Crown Colonies, but in\r\nthose territories originally British but now independent, like the\r\nUnited States, as well as in those territories which are in reality\r\nindependent, though nominally still under British control, like\r\nAustralia and Canada.\r\n\r\nMoreover, why need Germany occupy the extraordinary position of phantom\r\n\"ownership,\" which England occupies, in order to enjoy all the real\r\nbenefits which in our day result from a Colonial Empire? More Germans\r\nhave found homes in the United States in the last half-century than have\r\nEnglishmen in all their Colonies. It is calculated that between ten and\r\ntwelve millions of the population of the United States are of direct\r\nGerman descent It is true, of course, that Germans do not live under\r\ntheir flag, but it is equally true that they do not regret that fact,\r\nbut rejoice in it! The majority of German emigrants do not desire that\r\nthe land to which they go shall have the political character of the land\r\nwhich they leave behind. The fact that in adopting the United States\r\nthey have shed something of the German tradition and created a new\r\nnational type, partaking in part of the English and in part of the\r\nGerman, is, on the whole, very much to their advantage--and incidentally\r\nto ours.\r\n\r\nOf course it is urged that, despite all this, the national sentiment\r\nwill always desire, for the overflow of its population, territories in\r\nwhich that nation's language, law, and literature reign. But how far is\r\nthat aspiration one of those purely political aspirations still\r\npersisting, it is true, but really the result of the momentum of old\r\nideas, the outcome of facts long since passed away, and destined to\r\ndisappear as soon as the real facts have been absorbed by the general\r\npublic?\r\n\r\nThus a German will shout patriotically, and, if needs be, embroil his\r\ncountry in a war for an equatorial or Asiatic colony; the truth being\r\nthat he does not think about the matter seriously. But if he and his\r\nfamily have to emigrate, he _does_ think about it seriously, and then it\r\nis another matter; he does not choose Equatorial Africa or China; he\r\ngoes to the United States, which he knows to be a far better country in\r\nwhich to make his home than the Cameroons or Kiau Chau could ever be.\r\nIndeed, in England's own case, are not certain foreign countries much\r\nmore her real colonies for her children of the future than certain\r\nterritory under her own flag? Will not her children find better and more\r\ncongenial conditions, more readily build real homes, in Pennsylvania,\r\nwhich is \"foreign,\" than in Bombay, which is \"British\"?\r\n\r\nOf course, if by sheer military conquest it were possible to turn a\r\nUnited States or even a Canada into a real Germany--of German language,\r\nlaw, literature--the matter would assume another aspect. But the facts\r\ndealt with in the last chapter show that the day is past for conquest in\r\nthat form. Quite other means must be employed. The German conqueror of\r\nthe future would have to say with Napoleon: \"I come too late. The\r\nnations are too firmly set.\" Even when the English, the greatest\r\ncolonizers of the world, conquer a territory like the Transvaal or the\r\nOrange Free State, they have no resort, having conquered it, but to\r\nallow its own law, its own literature, its own language to have free\r\nplay, just as though the conquest had never taken place. This was even\r\nthe case with Quebec more than one hundred years ago, and Germany will\r\nhave to be guided by a like rule. On the morrow of conquest she would\r\nhave to proceed to establish her real ascendancy by other than military\r\nmeans--a thing she is free to do to-day, if she can. It cannot\r\nthroughout this discussion be too often repeated that the world has been\r\nmodified, and that what was possible to the Canaanites and the Romans,\r\nand even to the Normans, is no longer possible to us. The edict can no\r\nlonger go forth to \"slay every male child\" that is born into the\r\nconquered territory, in order that the race may be exterminated.\r\nConquest in this sense is impossible. The most marvellous colonial\r\nhistory in the world--British colonial history--demonstrates that in\r\nthis field physical force is no longer of avail.\r\n\r\nAnd Germans are beginning to realize it. \"We must resign ourselves in\r\nall clearness and calm to the fact that there is no possibility of\r\nacquiring Colonies suitable for emigration,\" writes Dr. P. Rohrbach. He\r\ncontinues:\r\n\r\n     But if we cannot have such Colonies, it by no means follows\r\n     that we cannot obtain the advantages, if only to a limited\r\n     extent, which make these Colonies desirable. It is a mistake to\r\n     regard the mere possession of extensive trans-oceanic\r\n     territories, even when they are able to absorb a part of the\r\n     national surplus of population, as necessarily a direct\r\n     increase of power. Australia, Canada, and South Africa do not\r\n     increase the power of the British Empire because they are\r\n     British possessions, nor yet because they are peopled by a few\r\n     million British emigrants and their descendants, but because by\r\n     trade with them the wealth and with it the defensive strength\r\n     of the Mother Country are increased. Colonies which do not\r\n     produce that result have but little value; and countries which\r\n     possess this importance for a nation, even though they are not\r\n     its Colonies, are in this decisive point a substitute for\r\n     colonial possessions in the ordinary sense.[36]\r\n\r\nIn fact the misleading political imagery to which I referred a few pages\r\nback has gone far to destroy our sense of reality and sense of\r\nproportion in the matter of political control of foreign territory, a\r\nfact which the diplomatic turmoil of 1911 most certainly illustrated. I\r\nhad occasion at the time to emphasize it in the following terms:\r\n\r\n     The Press of Europe and America is very busy discussing the\r\n     lessons of the diplomatic conflict which has just ended, and\r\n     the military conflict which has just begun. And the outstanding\r\n     impression which one gets from most of these essays in high\r\n     politics--whether French, Italian, or British--is that we have\r\n     been and still are witnessing part of a great world movement,\r\n     the setting in motion of Titanic forces \"deep-set in primordial\r\n     needs and impulses.\"\r\n\r\n     For months those in the secrets of the Chancelleries have\r\n     spoken with bated breath--as though in the presence of some\r\n     vision of Armageddon. On the strength of this mere talk of war\r\n     by the three nations, vast commerical interests have been\r\n     embarrassed, fortunes have been lost and won on the Bourses,\r\n     banks have suspended payment, some thousands have been ruined;\r\n     while the fact that the fourth and fifth nations have actually\r\n     gone to war has raised all sorts of further possibilities of\r\n     conflict, not alone in Europe, but in Asia, with remoter danger\r\n     of religious fanaticism and all its sequelae. International\r\n     bitterness and suspicion in general have been intensified, and\r\n     the one certain result of the whole thing is that immense\r\n     burdens will be added in the shape of further taxation for\r\n     armaments to the already heavy ones carried by the five or six\r\n     nations concerned. For two or three hundred millions of people\r\n     in Europe, life, which with all the problems of high prices,\r\n     labor wars, unsolved social difficulties, is none too easy as\r\n     it is, will be made harder still.\r\n\r\n     The needs, therefore, that can have provoked a conflict of\r\n     these dimensions must be \"primordial\" indeed. In fact one\r\n     authority assures us that what we have seen going on is \"the\r\n     struggle for life among men\"--that struggle which has its\r\n     parallel in the whole of sentient existence.\r\n\r\n     Well, I put it to you, as a matter worth just a moment or two\r\n     of consideration, that this conflict is about nothing of the\r\n     sort; that it is about a perfectly futile matter, one which the\r\n     immense majority of the German, English, French, Italian, and\r\n     Turkish people could afford to treat with the completest\r\n     indifference. For, to the vast majority of these 250,000,000\r\n     people more or less, it does not matter two straws whether\r\n     Morocco or some vague African swamp near the Equator is\r\n     administered by German, French, Italian, or Turkish officials,\r\n     so long as it is well administered. Or rather one should go\r\n     further: if French, German, or Italian colonization of the past\r\n     is any guide, the nation which wins in the contest for\r\n     territory of this sort has added a wealth-draining incubus.\r\n\r\n     This, of course, is preposterous; I am losing sight of the need\r\n     for making provision for the future expansion of the race, for\r\n     each party to \"find its place in the sun\"; and Heaven knows\r\n     what!\r\n\r\nThe European Press was full of these phrases at the time, and I\r\nattempted to weigh their real meaning by a comparison of French and\r\nGerman history in the matter of national \"expansion\" during the last\r\nthirty or forty years.\r\n\r\n     France has got a new empire, we are told; she has won a great\r\n     victory; she is growing and expanding and is richer by\r\n     something which her rivals are the poorer for not having.\r\n\r\n     Let us assume that she makes the same success of Morocco that\r\n     she has made of her other possessions, of, say, Tunis, which\r\n     represents one of the most successful of those operations of\r\n     colonial expansion which have marked her history during the\r\n     last forty years. What has been the precise effect on French\r\n     prosperity?\r\n\r\n     In thirty years, at a cost of many millions (it is part of\r\n     successful colonial administration in France never to let it be\r\n     known what the Colonies really cost), France has founded in\r\n     Tunis a Colony, in which to-day there are, excluding soldiers\r\n     and officials, about 25,000 genuine French colonists; just the\r\n     number by which the French population in France--the real\r\n     France--is diminishing every year! And the value of Tunis as a\r\n     market does not even amount to the sum which France spends\r\n     directly on its occupation and administration, to say nothing\r\n     of the indirect extension of military burdens which its\r\n     conquest involved; and, of course, the market which it\r\n     represents would still exist in some form, though England--or\r\n     even Germany--administered the country.\r\n\r\n     In other words, France loses every year in her home population\r\n     a Colony equivalent to Tunis--if we measure Colonies in terms\r\n     of communities made up of the race which has sprung from the\r\n     Mother Country. And yet, if once in a generation her rulers and\r\n     diplomats can point to 25,000 Frenchmen living artificially\r\n     and exotically under conditions which must in the long-run be\r\n     inimical to their race, it is pointed to as \"expansion\" and as\r\n     evidence that France is maintaining her position as a Great\r\n     Power. In a few years, as history goes, unless there is some\r\n     complete change in tendencies, which at present seem as strong\r\n     as ever, the French race, as we know it, will have ceased to\r\n     exist, swamped without the firing, may be, of a single shot, by\r\n     the Germans, Belgians, English, Italians, and Jews. There are\r\n     to-day more Germans in France than there are Frenchmen in all\r\n     the Colonies that France has acquired in the last half-century,\r\n     and German trade with France outweighs enormously the trade of\r\n     France with all French Colonies. France is to-day a better\r\n     Colony for the Germans than they could make of any exotic\r\n     Colony which France owns.\r\n\r\n     \"They _tell_ me,\" said a French Deputy recently (in a not quite\r\n     original _mot_), \"that the Germans are at Agadir. I _know_ they\r\n     are in the Champs-Elysees.\" Which, of course, is in reality a\r\n     much more serious matter.\r\n\r\n     On the other side we are to assume that Germany has during the\r\n     period of France's expansion,--since the war--not expanded at\r\n     all. That she has been throttled and cramped--that she has not\r\n     had her place in the sun; and that is why she must fight for it\r\n     and endanger the security of her neighbors.\r\n\r\n     Well, I put it to you again that all this in reality is false:\r\n     that Germany has not been cramped or throttled; that, on the\r\n     contrary, as we recognize when we get away from the mirage of\r\n     the map, her expansion has been the wonder of the world. She\r\n     has added twenty millions to her population--one-half the\r\n     present population of France--during a period in which the\r\n     French population has actually diminished. Of all the nations\r\n     in Europe, she has cut the biggest slice in the development of\r\n     world trade, industry, and influence. Despite the fact that she\r\n     has not \"expanded\" in the sense of mere political dominion, a\r\n     proportion of her population, equivalent to the white\r\n     population of the whole Colonial British Empire, make their\r\n     living, or the best part of it, from the development and\r\n     exploitation of territory outside her borders. These facts are\r\n     not new, they have been made the text of thousands of political\r\n     sermons preached in England itself during the last few years;\r\n     but one side of their significance seems to have been missed.\r\n\r\n     We get, then, this: On the one side a nation extending\r\n     enormously its political dominion, and yet diminishing in\r\n     national force--if by national force we mean the growth of a\r\n     sturdy, enterprising, vigorous people. (I am not denying that\r\n     France is both wealthy and comfortable, to a greater degree it\r\n     may be than her rival; but that is another story.) On the other\r\n     side, we get immense expansion expressed in terms of those\r\n     things--a growing and vigorous population, and the possibility\r\n     of feeding them--and yet the political dominion, speaking\r\n     practically, has hardly been extended at all.\r\n\r\n     Such a condition of things, if the common jargon of high\r\n     politics means anything, is preposterous. It takes nearly all\r\n     meaning out of most that we hear about \"primordial needs\" and\r\n     the rest of it.\r\n\r\n     As a matter of fact, we touch here one of the vital confusions,\r\n     which is at the bottom of most of the present political trouble\r\n     between nations, and shows the power of the old ideas and the\r\n     old phraseology.\r\n\r\n     In the days of the sailing ship and the lumbering wagon\r\n     dragging slowly over all but impassable roads, for one country\r\n     to derive any considerable profit from another it had\r\n     practically to administer it politically. But the compound\r\n     steam-engine, the railway, the telegraph, have profoundly\r\n     modified the elements of the whole problem. In the modern world\r\n     political dominion is playing a more and more effaced role as a\r\n     factor in commerce; the non-political factors have in practice\r\n     made it all but inoperative. It is the case with every modern\r\n     nation, actually, that the outside territories which it\r\n     exploits most successfully are precisely those of which it does\r\n     not \"own\" a foot. Even with the most characteristically\r\n     colonial of all--Great Britain--the greater part of her\r\n     overseas trade is done with countries which she makes no\r\n     attempt to \"own,\" control, coerce, or dominate--and\r\n     incidentally she has ceased to do any of those things with her\r\n     Colonies.\r\n\r\n     Millions of Germans in Prussia and Westphalia derive profit or\r\n     make their living out of countries to which their political\r\n     dominion in no way extends. The modern German exploits South\r\n     America by remaining at home. Where, forsaking this principle,\r\n     he attempts to work through political power, he approaches\r\n     futility. German Colonies are Colonies _pour rire_. The\r\n     Government has to bribe Germans to go to them; her trade with\r\n     them is microscopic; and if the twenty millions who have been\r\n     added to Germany's population since the war had had to depend\r\n     on their country's political conquest, they would have had to\r\n     starve. What feeds them are countries which Germany has never\r\n     \"owned,\" and never hopes to \"own\": Brazil, Argentina, the\r\n     United States, India, Australia, Canada, Russia, France, and\r\n     England. (Germany, which never spent a mark on its political\r\n     conquest, to-day draws more tribute from South America than\r\n     does Spain, which has poured out mountains of treasure and\r\n     oceans of blood in its conquest.) These are Germany's real\r\n     Colonies. Yet the immense interests which they represent, of\r\n     really primordial concern to Germany, without which so many of\r\n     her people would be actually without food, are for the\r\n     diplomats and the soldiers quite secondary ones; the immense\r\n     trade which they represent owes nothing to the diplomat, to\r\n     Agadir incidents, to _Dreadnoughts_: it is the unaided work of\r\n     the merchant and the manufacturer. All this diplomatic and\r\n     military conflict and rivalry, this waste of wealth, the\r\n     unspeakable foulness which Tripoli is revealing, are reserved\r\n     for things which both sides to the quarrel could sacrifice, not\r\n     merely without loss, but with profit. And Italy, whose\r\n     statesmen have been faithful to all the old \"axioms\" (Heaven\r\n     save the mark!) will discover it rapidly enough. Even her\r\n     defenders are ceasing now to urge that she can possibly derive\r\n     any real benefit from this colossal ineptitude.\r\n\r\n     Is it not time that the man in the street--verily, I believe,\r\n     less deluded by diplomatic jargon than his betters, less the\r\n     slave of an obsolete phraseology--insisted that the experts in\r\n     the high places acquired some sense of the reality of things,\r\n     of proportions, some sense of figures, a little knowledge of\r\n     industrial history, of the real processes of human\r\n     co-operation?\r\n\r\nBut are we to assume that the extension of a European nation's authority\r\noverseas can never be worth while; or that it could, or should, never be\r\nthe occasion for conflict between nations; or that the role of, say,\r\nEngland in India or Egypt, is neither useful nor profitable?\r\n\r\nIn the second part of this book I have attempted to uncover the general\r\nprinciple--which sadly needs establishing in politics--serving to\r\nindicate clearly the advantageous and disadvantageous employment of\r\nforce. Because force plays an undoubted role in human development and\r\nco-operation, it is sweepingly concluded that military force and the\r\nstruggle between groups must always be a normal feature of human\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nTo a critic, who maintained that the armies of the world were necessary\r\nand justifiable on the same grounds as the police forces of the world\r\n(\"Even in communities such as London, where, in our civic capacity, we\r\nhave nearly realized all your ideals, we still maintain and are\r\nconstantly improving our police force\"), I replied:\r\n\r\n     When we learn that London, instead of using its police for the\r\n     running in of burglars and \"drunks,\" is using them to lead an\r\n     attack on Birmingham for the purpose of capturing that city as\r\n     part of a policy of \"municipal expansion,\" or \"Civic\r\n     Imperialism,\" or \"Pan-Londonism,\" or what not; or is using its\r\n     force to repel an attack by the Birmingham police acting as the\r\n     result of a similar policy on the part of the Birmingham\r\n     patriots--when that happens you can safely approximate a police\r\n     force to a European army. But until it does, it is quite\r\n     evident that the two--the army and the police force--have in\r\n     reality diametrically opposed roles. The police exist as an\r\n     instrument of social co-operation; the armies as the natural\r\n     outcome of the quaint illusion that though one city could never\r\n     enrich itself by \"capturing\" or \"subjugating\" another, in some\r\n     unexplained way one country can enrich itself by capturing or\r\n     subjugating another.\r\n\r\nIn the existing condition of things in England this illustration covers\r\nthe whole case; the citizens of London would have no imaginable interest\r\nin \"conquering\" Birmingham, or _vice versa_. But suppose there arose in\r\nthe cities of the North such a condition of disorder that London could\r\nnot carry on its ordinary work and trade; then London, if it had the\r\npower, _would_ have an interest in sending its police into Birmingham,\r\npresuming that this could be done. The citizens of London would have a\r\ntangible interest in the maintenance of order in the North--they would\r\nbe the richer for it.\r\n\r\nOrder was just as well maintained in Alsace-Lorraine before the German\r\nconquest as it was after, and for that reason Germany has not benefited\r\nby the conquest. But order was not maintained in California, and would\r\nnot have been as well maintained under Mexican as under American rule,\r\nand for that reason America has benefited by the conquest of California.\r\nFrance has benefited by the conquest of Algeria, England by that of\r\nIndia, because in each case the arms were employed not, properly\r\nspeaking, for conquest at all, but for police purposes, for the\r\nestablishment and maintenance of order; and, so far as they achieved\r\nthat object, their role was a useful one.\r\n\r\nHow does this distinction affect the practical problem under discussion?\r\nMost fundamentally. Germany has no need to maintain order in England,\r\nnor England in Germany, and the latent struggle therefore between these\r\ntwo countries is futile. It is not the result of any inherent necessity\r\nof either people; it is the result merely of that woeful confusion which\r\ndominates statecraft to-day, and it is bound, so soon as that confusion\r\nis cleared up, to come to an end.\r\n\r\nWhere the condition of a territory is such that the social and economic\r\nco-operation of other countries with it is impossible, we may expect the\r\nintervention of military force, not as the result of the \"annexationist\r\nillusion,\" but as the outcome of real social forces pushing to the\r\nmaintenance of order. That is the story of England in Egypt, or, for\r\nthat matter, in India. But foreign nations have no need to maintain\r\norder in the British Colonies, nor in the United States; and though\r\nthere might be some such necessity in the case of countries like\r\nVenezuela, the last few years have taught us that by bringing these\r\ncountries into the great economic currents of the world, and so setting\r\nup in them a whole body of interests in favor of order, more can be done\r\nthan by forcible conquest. We occasionally hear rumors of German designs\r\nin Brazil and elsewhere, but even the modicum of education possessed by\r\nthe average European statesman makes it plain to him that these nations\r\nare, like the others, \"too firmly set\" for military occupation and\r\nconquest by an alien people.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the humors of the whole Anglo-German conflict that so much\r\nhas the British public been concerned with the myths and bogies of the\r\nmatter that it seems calmly to have ignored the realities. While even\r\nthe wildest Pan-German has never cast his eyes in the direction of\r\nCanada, he has cast them, and does cast them, in the direction of Asia\r\nMinor; and the political activities of Germany may centre on that area,\r\nfor precisely the reasons which result from the distinction between\r\npolicing and conquest, which I have drawn. German industry is coming to\r\nhave dominating interests in the Near East, and as those interests--her\r\nmarkets and investments--increase, the necessity for better order in,\r\nand the better organization of, those territories increases in\r\ncorresponding degree. Germany may need to police Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nWhat interest have we in attempting to prevent her? It may be urged that\r\nshe would close the markets of those territories against us. But even if\r\nshe attempted it, which she is never likely to do, a Protectionist Asia\r\nMinor organized with German efficiency would be better from the point of\r\nview of trade than a Free Trade Asia Minor organized _a la Turque_.\r\nProtectionist Germany is one of the best markets in Europe. If a second\r\nGermany were created in the Near East, if Turkey had a population with\r\nthe German purchasing power and the German tariff, the markets would be\r\nworth some two hundred to two hundred and fifty millions instead of some\r\nfifty to seventy-five. Why should we try to prevent Germany increasing\r\nour trade?\r\n\r\nIt is true that we touch here the whole problem of the fight for the\r\nopen door in the undeveloped territories. But the real difficulty in\r\nthis problem is not the open door at all, but the fact that Germany is\r\nbeating England--or England fears she is beating her in those\r\nterritories where she has the same tariff to meet that Germany has, or\r\neven a smaller one; and that she is even beating England in the\r\nterritories that the English already \"own\"--in their Colonies, in the\r\nEast, in India. How, therefore, would England's final crushing of\r\nGermany in the military sense change anything? Suppose England crushed\r\nher so completely that she \"owned\" Asia Minor and Persia as completely\r\nas she owns India or Hong Kong, would not the German merchant continue\r\nto beat her even then, as he is beating her now, in that part of the\r\nEast over which she already holds political sway? Again, how would the\r\ndisappearance of the German navy affect the problem one way or the\r\nother?\r\n\r\nMoreover, in this talk of the open door in the undeveloped territories,\r\nwe again seem to lose all our sense of proportion. English trade is in\r\nrelative importance first with the great nations--the United States,\r\nFrance, Germany, Argentina, South America generally--after that with the\r\nwhite Colonies; after that with the organized East; and last of all, and\r\nto a very small extent, with the countries concerned in this squabble\r\nfor the open door--territories in which the trade really is so small as\r\nhardly to pay for the making and upkeep of a dozen battleships.\r\n\r\nWhen the man in the street, or, for that matter, the journalistic\r\npundit, talks commercial diplomacy, his arithmetic seems to fall from\r\nhim. Some years since the question of the relative position of the\r\nthree Powers in Samoa exercised the minds of these wiseacres, who got\r\nfearfully warlike both in England and in the United States. Yet the\r\ntrade of the whole island is not worth that of an obscure Massachusetts\r\nvillage, and the notion that naval budgets should be increased to\r\n\"maintain our position,\" the notion that either of the countries\r\nconcerned should really think it worth while to build so much as a\r\nsingle battleship the more for such a purpose, is not throwing away a\r\nsprat to catch a whale, but throwing away a whale to catch a sprat--and\r\nthen not catching it. For even when you _have_ the predominant political\r\nposition, even when you _have_ got your extra _Dreadnought_ or extra\r\ndozen _Dreadnoughts_, it is the more efficiently organized nation on the\r\ncommercial side that will take the trade. And while England is getting\r\nexcited over the trade of territories that matter very little, rivals,\r\nincluding Germany, will be quietly walking off with the trade that\r\n_does_ matter, will be increasing their hold upon such markets as the\r\nUnited States, Argentina, South America, and the lesser Continental\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIf we really examined these questions without the old meaningless\r\nprepossessions, we should see that it is more to the general interest to\r\nhave an orderly and organized Asia Minor under German tutelage than to\r\nhave an unorganized and disorderly one which should be independent.\r\nPerhaps it would be best of all that Great Britain should do the\r\norganizing, or share it with Germany, though England has her hands full\r\nin that respect--Egypt and India are problems enough. Why should\r\nEngland forbid Germany to do in a small degree what she has done in a\r\nlarge degree? Sir Harry H. Johnston, in the _Nineteenth Century_ for\r\nDecember, 1910, comes a great deal nearer to touching the real kernel of\r\nthe problem that is preoccupying Germany than any of the writers on the\r\nAnglo-German conflict of whom I know. As the result of careful\r\ninvestigation, he admits that Germany's real objective is not, properly\r\nspeaking, England or England's Colonies at all, but the undeveloped\r\nlands of the Balkan Peninsula, Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, down even to the\r\nmouth of the Euphrates. He adds that the best informed Germans use this\r\nlanguage to him:\r\n\r\n     In regard to England, we would recall a phrase dropped by\r\n     ex-President Roosevelt at an important public speech in London,\r\n     a phrase which for some reason was not reported by the London\r\n     Press. Roosevelt said that the best guarantee for Great Britain\r\n     on the Nile is the presence of Germany on the Euphrates.\r\n     Putting aside the usual hypocrisies of the Teutonic peoples,\r\n     you know that this is so. You know that we ought to make common\r\n     cause in our dealing with the backward races of the world. Let\r\n     Britain and Germany once come to an agreement in regard to the\r\n     question of the Near East, and the world can scarcely again be\r\n     disturbed by any great war in any part of the globe, if such a\r\n     war is contrary to the interests of the two Empires.\r\n\r\nSuch, declares Sir Harry, is German opinion. And in all human\r\nprobability, so far as sixty-five million people can be said to have\r\nthe same opinion, he is absolutely right.\r\n\r\nIt is because the work of policing backward or disorderly populations is\r\nso often confused with the annexationist illusion that the danger of\r\nsquabbles in the matter is a real one. Not the fact that England is\r\ndoing a real and useful work for the world at large in policing India\r\ncreates jealousy of her work there, but the notion that in some way she\r\n\"possesses\" this territory, and draws tribute and exclusive advantage\r\ntherefrom. When Europe is a little more educated in these matters, the\r\nEuropean populations will realize that they have no primordial interest\r\nin furnishing the policemen. German public opinion will see that, even\r\nif such a thing were possible, the German people would gain no advantage\r\nby replacing England in India, especially as the final result of the\r\nadministrative work of Europe in the Near and Far East will be to make\r\npopulations like those of Asia Minor in the last resort their own\r\npolicemen. Should some Power, acting as policeman, ignoring the lessons\r\nof history, try again the experiment tried by Spain in South America and\r\nlater by England in North America, should she try to create for herself\r\nexclusive privileges and monopolies, the other nations have means of\r\nretaliation apart from the military ones--in the numberless instruments\r\nwhich the economic and financial relationships of nations furnish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nTHE HUMAN NATURE AND MORALS OF THE CASE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE PSYCHOLOGICAL CASE FOR WAR\r\n\r\n    The non-economic motives of war--Moral and psychological--The\r\n    importance of these pleas--English, German, and American\r\n    exponents--The biological plea.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the commonest plea urged in objection to the case presented in\r\nthe first part of this book is that the real motives of nations in going\r\nto war are not economic at all; that their conflicts arise from moral\r\ncauses, using that word in its largest sense; that they are the outcome\r\nof conflicting views of rights; or that they arise from, not merely\r\nnon-economic, but also non-rational causes--from vanity, rivalry, pride\r\nof place, the desire to be first, to occupy a great situation in the\r\nworld, to have power or prestige; from quick resentment of insult or\r\ninjury; from temper; the unreasoned desire, which comes of quarrel or\r\ndisagreement, to dominate a rival at all costs; from the \"inherent\r\nhostility\" that exists between rival nations; from the contagion of\r\nsheer passion, the blind strife of mutually hating men; and generally\r\nbecause men and nations always have fought and always will, and because,\r\nlike the animals in Watt's doggerel, \"it is their nature to.\"\r\n\r\nAn expression of the first point of view is embodied in the criticism of\r\nan earlier edition of this book, in which the critic says:\r\n\r\n     The cause of war is spiritual, not material.... The great wars\r\n     arose from conflicts as to rights, and the dangerous causes of\r\n     war are the existence of antagonistic ideas of rights or\r\n     righteousness.... It is for moral ideas that men are most ready\r\n     to make sacrifices.[37]\r\n\r\nA similar criticism is made by Admiral Mahan.[38]\r\n\r\nIn the same way the London _Spectator_ while admitting the truth of the\r\nprinciples outlined in the first part of this book, deems that such\r\nfacts do not seriously affect the basic cause of war:\r\n\r\n     Just as individuals quarrel among themselves, and fight as\r\n     bitterly as the police and the law courts will allow them, not\r\n     because they think it will make them rich, but because their\r\n     blood is up, and they want to stand up for what they believe to\r\n     be their rights, or to revenge themselves for wrongs done to\r\n     them, as they think, by their fellows, so nations will fight,\r\n     even though it is demonstrable that they will get no material\r\n     gain thereby.... They want sometimes freedom, sometimes power.\r\n     Sometimes a passion for expansion or dominion comes over them.\r\n     Sometimes they seem impelled to fight for fighting's sake, or,\r\n     as their leaders and rhetoricians vaguely say, to fulfil their\r\n     destinies.... Men fight sometimes for the love of fighting,\r\n     sometimes for great and noble causes, and sometimes for bad\r\n     causes, but practically never with an account-book and a\r\n     balance-sheet in their hands.\r\n\r\nI desire to give every possible weight to this plea, and not to shirk a\r\ndetail of it, and I think that the pages that follow cover every one of\r\nthe points here raised. But there is a whole school of philosophy which\r\ngoes much farther than the _Spectator_. The view just cited rather\r\nimplies that though it is a fact that men settle their differences by\r\nforce and passion, instead of by reason, it is a regrettable fact. But\r\nthe school to which I refer urges that men should be encouraged to\r\nfight, and that war is the preferable solution. War, declare these\r\nphilosophers, is a valuable discipline for the nations, and it is not\r\ndesirable to see human conflict shifted from the plane of physical\r\nforce. They urge that humanity will be permanently the poorer when, as\r\none of them has put it, the great struggles of mankind become merely the\r\nstruggles of \"talk and money-bags.\"\r\n\r\nParenthetically, it should be pointed out that the matter has a good\r\ndeal more than academic interest. This philosophy constitutes a constant\r\nelement of resistance to that reform of political thought and tradition\r\nin Europe which must be the necessary precedent of a sounder condition.\r\nNot merely, of course, do international situations become infinitely\r\nmore dangerous when you get, on both sides of the frontier, a general\r\n\"belief in war for war's sake,\" but a tendency is directly created to\r\ndiscredit the use of patience, a quality as much needed in the\r\nrelationship of nations as in that of individuals; and further there is\r\na tendency to justify political action making for war as against action\r\nthat might avoid it. All these pleas, biological and otherwise, are\r\npowerful factors in creating an atmosphere and temperament in Europe\r\nfavorable to war and unfavorable to international agreement. For, be it\r\nnoted, this philosophy is not special to any one country: one finds it\r\nplentifully expressed in England and America, as well as in France and\r\nGermany. It is a European doctrine, part of that \"mind of Europe,\" of\r\nwhich someone has spoken, that, among other factors, determines the\r\ncharacter of European civilization generally.\r\n\r\nThis particular point of view has received a notable re-statement quite\r\nrecently[39] from General Bernhardi, a distinguished cavalry General,\r\nand probably the most influential German writer on current strategical\r\nand tactical problems, in his book, \"Deutschland und der naechste\r\nKrieg.\"[40] He therein gives very candid expression to the opinion that\r\nGermany must, regardless of the rights and interests of other peoples,\r\nfight her way to predominance. One of the chapters is headed, \"The Duty\r\nto Make War.\" He describes the peace movement in Germany as \"poisonous,\"\r\nand proclaims the doctrine that the duties and tasks of the German\r\npeople cannot be fulfilled save by the sword. \"The duty of\r\nself-assertion is by no means exhausted in the mere repelling of\r\nhostile attacks. It includes the need of securing to the whole people,\r\nwhich the State embraces, the possibility of existence and development.\"\r\nIt is desirable, declares the author, that conquest shall be effected by\r\nwar, and not by peaceful means; Silesia would not have had the same\r\nvalue for Prussia if Frederick the Great had obtained it from an\r\nArbitration Court. The attempt to abolish war is not only \"immoral and\r\nunworthy of humanity,\" it is an attempt to deprive man of his highest\r\npossession--the right to stake physical life for ideal ends. The German\r\npeople \"must learn to see that the maintenance of peace cannot be, and\r\nmust never be, the goal of policy.\"\r\n\r\nSimilar efforts are being made in England by English writers to secure\r\nthe acceptance of this doctrine of force. Many passages almost\r\nduplicating those of Bernhardi, or at least extolling the general\r\ndoctrine of force, may be found in the writings of such Anglo-Saxon\r\nauthors as Admiral Mahan and Professor Spenser Wilkinson.[41]\r\n\r\nA scientific color is often given to the philosophy of force, as\r\nexpressed by the authors just referred to, by an appeal to evolutionary\r\nand biological laws.\r\n\r\nIt is urged that the condition of man's advance in the past has been the\r\nsurvival of the fit by struggle and warfare, and that in that struggle\r\nit is precisely those endowed with combativeness and readiness to fight\r\nwho have survived. Thus the tendency to combat is not a mere human\r\nperversity, but is part of the self-protective instinct rooted in a\r\nprofound biological law--the struggle of nations for survival.\r\n\r\nThis point of view is expressed by S.R. Steinmetz in his \"Philosophie\r\ndes Krieges.\" War, according to this author, is an ordeal instituted by\r\nGod, who weighs the nations in its balance. It is the essential function\r\nof the State, and the only function in which peoples can employ all\r\ntheir powers at once and convergently. No victory is possible save as\r\nthe resultant of a totality of virtues; no defeat for which some vice or\r\nweakness is not responsible. Fidelity, cohesiveness, tenacity, heroism,\r\nconscience, education, inventiveness, economy, wealth, physical health\r\nand vigor--there is no moral or intellectual point of superiority that\r\ndoes not tell when \"God holds His assizes, and hurls the peoples one\r\nupon another\" (Die Weltgeschichte ist das Weltgericht); and Dr.\r\nSteinmetz does not believe that in the long-run chance and luck play any\r\npart in apportioning the issues.\r\n\r\nIt is urged that international hostility is merely the psychological\r\nstimulus to that combativeness which is a necessary element of\r\nexistence, and that though, like other elemental instincts--our animal\r\nappetites, for instance--it may in some of its manifestations be ugly\r\nenough, it makes for survival, and is to that extent a part of the great\r\nplan. Too great a readiness to accept the \"friendly assurances\" of\r\nanother nation and an undue absence of distrust would, in accordance\r\nwith a sort of Gresham's Law in international relationships, make\r\nsteadily for the disappearance of the humane and friendly communities in\r\nfavor of the truculent and brutal. If friendliness and good-feeling\r\ntowards other nations led us to relax our self-defensive efforts, the\r\nquarrelsome communities would see, in this slackening, an opportunity to\r\ncommit aggression, and there would be a tendency, therefore, for the\r\nleast civilized to wipe out the most. Animosity and hostility between\r\nnations is a corrective of this sentimental slackness, and to that\r\nextent it plays a useful role, however ugly it may appear--\"not pretty,\r\nbut useful, like the dustman.\" Though the material and economic motives\r\nwhich prompt conflict may no longer obtain, other than economic motives\r\nwill be found for collision, so profound is the psychological stimulus\r\nthereto.\r\n\r\nSome such view as this has found lurid expression in the recent work of\r\nan American soldier, Homer Lea.[42] The author urges not only that war\r\nis inevitable, but that any systematic attempt to prevent it is merely\r\nan unwise meddling with the universal law.\r\n\r\n     National entities, in their birth, activities, and death, are\r\n     controlled by the same laws that govern all life--plant,\r\n     animal, or national--the law of struggle, the law of survival.\r\n     These laws, so universal as regards life and time, so\r\n     unalterable in causation and consummation, are only variable in\r\n     the duration of national existence as the knowledge of and\r\n     obedience to them is proportionately true or false. Plans to\r\n     thwart them, to shortcut them, to circumvent, to cozen, to\r\n     deny, to scorn and violate them, is folly such as man's conceit\r\n     alone makes possible. Never has this been tried--and man is\r\n     ever at it--but what the end has been gangrenous and fatal.\r\n\r\n     In theory international arbitration denies the inexorability of\r\n     natural laws, and would substitute for them the veriest\r\n     Cagliostroic formulas, or would, with the vanity of Canute, sit\r\n     down on the ocean-side of life and command the ebb and flow of\r\n     its tides to cease.\r\n\r\n     The idea of international arbitration as a substitute for\r\n     natural laws that govern the existence of political entities\r\n     arises not only from a denial of their fiats and an ignorance\r\n     of their application, but from a total misconception of war,\r\n     its causes, and its meaning.\r\n\r\nHomer Lea's thesis is emphasized in the introduction to his work,\r\nwritten by another American soldier, General John P. Storey:\r\n\r\n     A few idealists may have visions that with advancing\r\n     civilization war and its dread horrors will cease. Civilization\r\n     has not changed human nature. The nature of man makes war\r\n     inevitable. Armed strife will not disappear from the earth\r\n     until human nature changes.\r\n\r\n\"Weltstadt und Friedensproblem,\" the book of Professor Baron Karl von\r\nStengel, a jurist who was one of Germany's delegates at the First Hague\r\nPeace Conference, contains a chapter entitled \"The Significance of War\r\nfor Development of Humanity,\" in which the author says:\r\n\r\n     War has more often facilitated than hindered progress. Athens\r\n     and Rome, not only in spite of, but just because of their many\r\n     wars, rose to the zenith of civilization. Great States like\r\n     Germany and Italy are welded into nationalities only through\r\n     blood and iron.\r\n\r\n     Storm purifies the air and destroys the frail trees, leaving\r\n     the sturdy oaks standing. War is the test of a nation's\r\n     political, physical, and intellectual worth. The State in which\r\n     there is much that is rotten may vegetate for a while in peace,\r\n     but in war its weakness is revealed.\r\n\r\n     Germany's preparations for war have not resulted in economic\r\n     disaster, but in unexampled economic expansion, unquestionably\r\n     because of our demonstrated superiority over France. It is\r\n     better to spend money on armaments and battleships than luxury,\r\n     motormania, and other sensual living.\r\n\r\nWe know that Moltke expressed a similar view in his famous letter to\r\nBluntschli. \"A perpetual peace,\" declared the Field-Marshal, \"is a\r\ndream, and not even a beautiful dream. War is one of the elements of\r\norder in the world, established by God. The noblest virtues of men are\r\ndeveloped therein. Without war the world would degenerate and disappear\r\nin a morass of materialism.\"[43]\r\n\r\nAt the very time that Moltke was voicing this sentiment, a precisely\r\nsimilar one was being voiced by no less a person than Ernest Renan. In\r\nhis \"La Reforme Intellectuelle et Morale\" (Paris: Levy, 1871, p. 111) he\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n     If the foolishness, negligence, idleness, and short-sightedness\r\n     of States did not involve their occasional collision, it is\r\n     difficult to imagine the degree of degeneracy to which the\r\n     human race would descend. War is one of the conditions of\r\n     progress, the sting which prevents a country from going to\r\n     sleep, and compels satisfied mediocrity itself to awaken from\r\n     its apathy. Man is only sustained by effort and struggle. The\r\n     day that humanity achieves a great pacific Roman Empire, having\r\n     no external enemies, that day its morality and its intelligence\r\n     will be placed in the very greatest peril.\r\n\r\nIn our own times a philosophy not very dissimilar has been voiced in the\r\npublic declarations of ex-President Roosevelt. I choose a few phrases\r\nfrom his speeches and writings, at random:\r\n\r\n     We despise a nation, just as we despise a man, who submits to\r\n     insult. What is true of a man ought to be true of a nation.[44]\r\n\r\n     We must play a great part in the world, and especially ...\r\n     perform those deeds of blood, of valor, which above everything\r\n     else bring national renown.\r\n\r\n     We do not admire a man of timid peace.\r\n\r\n     By war alone can we acquire those virile qualities necessary to\r\n     win in the stern strife of actual life.\r\n\r\n     In this world the nation that is trained to a career of\r\n     unwarlike and isolated ease is bound to go down in the end\r\n     before other nations which have not lost the manly and\r\n     adventurous qualities.[45]\r\n\r\nProfessor William James covers the whole ground of these claims in the\r\nfollowing passage:\r\n\r\n     The war party is assuredly right in affirming that the martial\r\n     virtues, although originally gained by the race through war,\r\n     are absolute and permanent human goods. Patriotic pride and\r\n     ambition in their military form are, after all, only\r\n     specifications of a more universal and enduring competitive\r\n     passion.... Pacifism makes no converts from the military party.\r\n     The military party denies neither the bestiality, nor the\r\n     horror, nor the expense; it only says that these things tell\r\n     but half the story. It only says that war is worth these\r\n     things; that, taking human nature as a whole, war is its best\r\n     protection against its weaker and more cowardly self, and that\r\n     mankind cannot afford to adopt a peace economy.... Militarism\r\n     is the great preserver of our ideals of hardihood, and human\r\n     life without hardihood would be contemptible.... This natural\r\n     feeling forms, I think, the innermost soul of army writings.\r\n     Without any exception known to me, militarist authors take a\r\n     highly mystical view of their subject, and regard war as a\r\n     biological or sociological necessity.... Our ancestors have\r\n     bred pugnacity into our bone and marrow and thousands of years\r\n     of peace won't breed it out of us.[46]\r\n\r\nEven famous English clergymen have voiced the same view. Charles\r\nKingsley, in his defence of the Crimean War as a \"just war against\r\ntyrants and oppressors,\" wrote: \"For the Lord Jesus Christ is not only\r\nthe Prince of Peace, He is the Prince of War, too. He is the Lord of\r\nHosts, the God of armies, and whoever fights in a just war against\r\ntyrants and oppressors is fighting on Christ's side, and Christ is\r\nfighting on his side. Christ is his captain and his leader, and he can\r\nbe in no better service. Be sure of it, for the Bible tells you so.\"[47]\r\n\r\nCanon Newbolt, Dean Farrar, and the Archbishop of Armagh, have all\r\nwritten not dissimilarly.\r\n\r\nThe whole case may be summarized thus:\r\n\r\n1. Nations fight for opposing conceptions of right: it is the moral\r\nconflict of men.\r\n\r\n2. They fight from non-rational causes of a lower kind: from vanity,\r\nrivalry, pride of place, the desire to occupy a great situation in the\r\nworld, or from sheer hostility to dissimilar people--the blind strife of\r\nmutually hating men.\r\n\r\n3. These causes justify war, or render it inevitable. The first is\r\nadmirable in itself, the second is inevitable, in that the peoples\r\nreadiest to fight, and showing most energy in fighting, replace the more\r\npeacefully inclined, and the warlike type tends thus permanently to\r\nsurvive; \"the warlike nations inherit the earth.\"\r\n\r\nOr it may be put deductively, thus: Since struggle is the law of life,\r\nand a condition of survival as much with nations as with other\r\norganisms, pugnacity, which is merely intense energy in struggle, a\r\nreadiness to accept struggle in its acutest form, must necessarily be a\r\nquality marking those individuals successful in the vital contests. It\r\nis this deep-seated, biological law which renders impossible the\r\nacceptance by mankind of the literal injunction to turn the other cheek\r\nto the smiter, or for human nature ever to conform to the ideal implied\r\nin that injunction; since, were it accepted, the best men and\r\nnations--in the sense of the kindliest and most humane--would be placed\r\nat the mercy of the most brutal, who, eliminating the least brutal,\r\nwould stamp the survivors with their own brutality and re-establish the\r\nmilitarist virtues. For this reason a readiness to fight, which means\r\nthe qualities of rivalry and pride and combativeness, hardihood,\r\ntenacity, and heroism--what we know as the manly qualities--must in any\r\ncase survive as the race survives, and, since this stands in the way of\r\nthe predominance of the purely brutal, it is a necessary part of the\r\nhighest morality.\r\n\r\nDespite the apparent force of these propositions, they are founded upon\r\na gross misreading of certain facts, and especially upon a gross\r\nmisapplication of a certain biological analogy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE PSYCHOLOGICAL CASE FOR PEACE\r\n\r\n    The shifting ground of pro-war arguments--The narrowing gulf\r\n    between the material and moral ideals--The non-rational causes of\r\n    war--False biological analogies--The real law of man's struggle:\r\n    struggle with Nature, not with other men--Outline sketch of man's\r\n    advance and main operating factor therein--The progress towards\r\n    elimination of physical force--Co-operation across frontiers\r\n    and its psychological result--Impossible to fix limits of\r\n    community--Such limits irresistibly expanding--Break up of\r\n    State homogeneity--State limits no longer coinciding with real\r\n    conflicts between men.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who have followed at all closely the peace advocacy of the last\r\nfew years will have observed a curious shifting of ground on the part of\r\nits opponents. Until quite recently, most peace advocacy being based on\r\nmoral, not material grounds, pacifists were generally criticized as\r\nunduly idealistic, sentimental, oblivious to the hard necessities of men\r\nin a hard world of struggle, and disposed to ask too much of human\r\nnature in the way of altruistic self-sacrifice on behalf of an\r\nidealistic dogma. We were given to understand that while peace might\r\nrepresent a great moral ideal, man's evil passions and cupidity would\r\nalways stand in the way of its achievement. The citations I have given\r\nin Chapter II. of the first part of this book prove sufficiently, I\r\nthink, that this was, until quite recently, overwhelmingly the point of\r\nview of those who defended war as an unavoidable part of human struggle.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years, however, the defence of war has been made for\r\nthe most part on very different grounds. Peace, we are told by those who\r\noppose the pacifist movement, may embody the material interests of men,\r\nbut the spiritual nature of mankind will stand in the way of its ever\r\nbeing achieved! Pacifism, far from being branded as too idealistic and\r\nsentimental, is now scorned as \"sordidly material.\"\r\n\r\nI do not desire, in calling attention to this fact, merely to score a\r\ncheap jibe. I want, on the contrary, to do every justice to the point of\r\nview of those who urge that moral motives push men into war. I have\r\nnever, indeed, taken the ground that the defender of war is morally\r\ninferior to the defender of peace, or that much is to be gained by\r\nemphasizing the moral superiority of the peace ideal. Too often has it\r\nbeen assumed in pacifist advocacy that what is needed in order to clear\r\nup the difficulties in the international field, is a better moral tone,\r\na greater kindliness, and so forth--for that assumption ignores the fact\r\nthat the emotion of humanity repelling it from war may be more than\r\ncounteracted by the equally strong moral emotion that we connect with\r\npatriotism. The patriot admits that war may occasion suffering, but\r\nurges that men should be prepared to endure suffering for their country.\r\nAs I pointed out in the first chapter of this book, the pacifist appeal\r\nto humanity so often fails because the militarist pleads that he too is\r\nworking and suffering for humanity.\r\n\r\nMy object in calling attention to this unconscious shifting of ground,\r\non the part of the advocate of war, is merely to suggest that the growth\r\nof events during the last generation has rendered the economic case for\r\nwar practically untenable, and has consequently compelled those who\r\ndefend war to shift their defence. Nor, of course, am I urging that the\r\nsentimental defence of war is a modern doctrine--the quotations made in\r\nthe last chapter show that not to be the case--but merely that greater\r\nemphasis is now placed upon the moral case.\r\n\r\nThus, writing in 1912, Admiral Mahan criticizes this book as follows:\r\n\r\n     The purpose of armaments, in the minds of those maintaining\r\n     them, is not primarily an economical advantage, in the sense of\r\n     depriving a neighboring State of its own, or fear of such\r\n     consequences to itself through the deliberate aggression of a\r\n     rival having that particular end in view.... The fundamental\r\n     proposition of the book is a mistake. Nations are under no\r\n     illusion as to the unprofitableness of war in itself.... The\r\n     entire conception of the work is itself an illusion, based upon\r\n     a profound misreading of human action. To regard the world as\r\n     governed by self-interest only is to live in a non-existent\r\n     world, an ideal world, a world possessed by an idea much less\r\n     worthy than those which mankind, to do it bare justice,\r\n     persistently entertains.[48]\r\n\r\nYet hardly four years previously Admiral Mahan had himself outlined the\r\nelements of international politics as follows:\r\n\r\n     It is as true now as when Washington penned the words, and will\r\n     always be true, that it is vain to expect nations to act\r\n     consistently from any motive other than that of interest. This\r\n     under the name of Realism is the frankly avowed motive of\r\n     German statecraft. It follows from this directly that the study\r\n     of interests--international interest--is the one basis of\r\n     sound, of provident, policy for statesmen....\r\n\r\n     The old predatory instinct, that he should take who has the\r\n     power, survives ... and moral force is not sufficient to\r\n     determine issues unless supported by physical. Governments are\r\n     corporations, and corporations have no souls ... they must put\r\n     first the rival interests of their own wards ... their own\r\n     people. Commercial and industrial predominance forces a nation\r\n     to seek markets, and, where possible, to control them to its\r\n     own advantage by preponderating force, the ultimate expression\r\n     of which is possession ... an inevitable link in a chain of\r\n     logical sequences: industry, markets, control, navy bases.[49]\r\n\r\nAdmiral Mahan, it is true, anticipates this criticism by pleading the\r\ncomplex character of human nature (which no one denies). He says:\r\n\"Bronze is copper, and bronze is tin.\" But he entirely overlooks the\r\nfact that if one withholds copper or one withholds tin it is no longer\r\nbronze. The present author has never taken the ground that all\r\ninternational action can be explained in the terms of one narrow motive,\r\nbut he does take the ground that if you can profoundly modify the\r\nbearing of a constituent, as important as the one to which Admiral Mahan\r\nhas himself, in his own work, attributed such weight, you will\r\nprofoundly modify the whole texture and character of international\r\nrelations. Thus, even though it were true that the thesis here\r\nelaborated were as narrowly economic as the criticism I have quoted\r\nwould imply, it would, nevertheless, have, on Admiral Mahan's own\r\nshowing, a very profound bearing on the problems of international\r\nstatecraft.\r\n\r\nNot only do the principles elaborated here postulate no such narrow\r\nconception of human motive, but it is essential to realize that you\r\ncannot separate a problem of interest from a problem of right or\r\nmorality in the absolute fashion that Admiral Mahan would imply, because\r\nright and morality connote the protection and promotion of the general\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nA nation, a people, we are given to understand, have higher motives than\r\nmoney or \"self-interest.\" What do we mean when we speak of the money of\r\na nation, or the self-interest of a community? We mean--and in such a\r\ndiscussion as this can mean nothing else--better conditions for the\r\ngreat mass of the people, the fullest possible lives, the abolition or\r\nattenuation of poverty and of narrow circumstances; that the millions\r\nshall be better housed and clothed and fed, more capable of making\r\nprovision for sickness and old age, with lives prolonged and\r\ncheered--and not merely this, but also that they shall be better\r\neducated, with character disciplined by steady labor and a better use of\r\nleisure; a general social atmosphere which shall make possible family\r\naffection, individual dignity and courtesy and the graces of life, not\r\nonly among the few, but among the many.\r\n\r\nNow, do these things constitute, as a national policy, an inspiring aim,\r\nor not? They are, speaking in terms of communities, pure\r\nself-interest--bound up with economic problems, with money. Does Admiral\r\nMahan mean us to take him at his word when he would attach to such\r\nefforts the same discredit that one implies in talking of a mercenary\r\nindividual? Would he have us believe that the typical great movements of\r\nour time--Socialism, Trades Unionism, Syndicalism, Insurance Acts, Land\r\nReforms, Old Age Pensions, Charity Organization, improved\r\nEducation--bound up as they all are with economic problems--are not the\r\nobjects which, more and more, are absorbing the best activities of\r\nChristendom?\r\n\r\nIn the pages which follow, I have attempted to show that the activities\r\nwhich lie outside the range of these things--the religious wars,\r\nmovements like those which promoted the Crusades, or the sort of\r\ntradition which we associate with the duel (which has, in fact,\r\ndisappeared from Anglo-Saxon society)--do not, and cannot, any longer\r\nform part of the impulse creating the long-sustained conflicts between\r\nlarge groups which a European war implies. I have attempted roughly to\r\nindicate certain processes at work; to show, among other things, that\r\nin the changing character of men's ideals there is a distinct narrowing\r\nof the gulf which is supposed to separate ideal and material aims. Early\r\nideals, whether in the field of politics or religion, are generally\r\ndissociated from any aim of general well-being. In early politics,\r\nideals are concerned simply with personal allegiance to some dynastic\r\nchief, a feudal lord, or a monarch; the well-being of a community does\r\nnot enter into the matter at all. Later the chief must embody in his\r\nperson that well-being, or he does not obtain the allegiance of a\r\ncommunity of any enlightenment; later, the well-being of the community\r\nbecomes the end in itself, without being embodied in the person of an\r\nhereditary chief, so that the people realize that their efforts, instead\r\nof being directed to the protection of the personal interests of some\r\nchief, are as a matter of fact directed to the protection of their own\r\ninterests, and their altruism has become communal self-interest, since\r\nthe self-sacrifice of the community for the sake of the community is a\r\ncontradiction in terms. In the religious sphere a similar development\r\nhas occurred. Early religious ideals have no relation to the material\r\nbetterment of mankind. The early Christian thought it meritorious to\r\nlive a sterile life at the top of a pillar, eaten by vermin, just as the\r\nHindoo saint to-day thinks it meritorious to live an equally sterile\r\nlife upon a bed of spikes. But as the early Christian ideal progressed,\r\nsacrifices having no end connected with the betterment of mankind lost\r\ntheir appeal. Our admiration now goes, not to the recluse who does\r\nnothing for mankind, but rather to the priest who gives his life to\r\nbring a ray of comfort to a leper settlement. The Christian saint who\r\nwould allow the nails of his fingers to grow through the palms of his\r\nclasped hands would excite, not our admiration, but our revolt. More and\r\nmore is religious effort being subjected to this test: Does it make for\r\nthe improvement of society? If not, it stands condemned. Political\r\nideals are inevitably undergoing a similar development, and will be more\r\nand more subjected to a similar test.[50]\r\n\r\nI am aware that very often at present they are not thus tested.\r\nDominated as our political thought is by Roman and feudal\r\nimagery--hypnotized by symbols and analogies which the necessary\r\ndevelopment of organized society has rendered obsolete--the ideals even\r\nof democracies are still often pure abstractions, divorced from any aim\r\ncalculated to advance the moral or material betterment of mankind. The\r\ncraze for sheer size of territory, the mere extent of administrative\r\narea, is still deemed a thing deserving immense, incalculable\r\nsacrifices.\r\n\r\nEven these ideals, however, firmly set as they are in our language and\r\ntradition, are rapidly yielding to the necessary force of events. A\r\ngeneration ago it would have been inconceivable that a people or a\r\nmonarch should calmly see part of its country secede and establish\r\nitself as a separate political entity without attempting to prevent it\r\nby force of arms. Yet this is what happened, a year or two ago, in the\r\nScandinavian peninsula. For forty years Germany has added to her own\r\ndifficulties and to those of the European situation for the purpose of\r\nincluding Alsace and Lorraine in its Federation, but even there, obeying\r\nthe tendency which is world-wide, an attempt has been made to create a\r\nconstitutional and autonomous government. The history of the British\r\nEmpire for fifty years has been a process of undoing the work of\r\nconquest. Colonies are now neither colonies nor possessions; they are\r\nindependent States. England, which for centuries has made such\r\nsacrifices to retain Ireland, is now making great sacrifices in order to\r\nmake her secession workable. To each political arrangement, to each\r\npolitical ideal, the final test will be applied: does it, or does it\r\nnot, make for the widest interests of the mass of the people involved?\r\n\r\nIt is true that those who emphasize the psychological causes of war\r\nmight rejoin with another distinction. They might urge that, though the\r\nquestions dividing nations had more or less their origin in an economic\r\nproblem, the economic question becomes itself a moral question, a\r\nquestion of right. It was not the few pence of the tax on tea that the\r\nColonies fought about, but the question of right which its payment\r\ninvolved. So with nations. War, ineffective to achieve an economic end,\r\nunprofitable in the sense that the cost involved in the defence of a\r\ngiven economic point exceeds the monetary value of that point, will\r\nstill be fought because a point, trifling in the economic sense, is all\r\nimportant from the point of view of right; and though there is no real\r\ndivision of interests between nations, though those interests are in\r\nreality interdependent, minor differences provoking a sudden and\r\nuncontrolled flash of temper suffice to provoke war. War is the outcome\r\nof the \"hot fits\" of men, \"of the devil that is in them.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough militarist literature on this, as on most similar points, shows\r\nflagrant contradictions, even that literature is against the view that\r\nwar is the outcome of the sheer sudden temper of nations. Most of the\r\npopular, and all of the scientific, militarist writers take the contrary\r\nview. Mr. Blatchford and his school normally represent a typical\r\nmilitarist policy, like that of Germany, as actuated by a cold, deep,\r\nMachiavellian, unsentimental, calculated opportunism, as diverse from a\r\nwild, irrational explosion of feeling as possible. Mr. Blatchford\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n     German policy, based upon the teachings of Clausewitz, may be\r\n     expressed in two questions, the questions laid down by\r\n     Clausewitz: \"Is it expedient to do this? Have we the power to\r\n     do it?\" If it will benefit the Fatherland to break up the\r\n     British Empire, then it is expedient to break up the British\r\n     Empire. Clausewitz taught Germany that \"war is a part of\r\n     policy.\" He taught that policy is a system of bargaining or\r\n     negotiating, backed by arms. Clausewitz does not discuss the\r\n     moral aspect of war; he deals with power and expediency. His\r\n     pupils take his lead. They do not read poems on the blessings\r\n     of peace; they do not spend ink on philanthropic theories.\r\n\r\nAll the more scientific writers, without an exception, so far as I am\r\naware, repudiate its \"accidental\" character. They one and all, from\r\nGrotius to Von der Goltz, take the view that it results from definite\r\nand determinable laws, like all the great processes of human\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nVon der Goltz (\"On the Conduct of War\") says:\r\n\r\n     One must never lose sight of the fact that war is the\r\n     consequence and continuation of policy. One will act on the\r\n     defensive strategically or rest on the defensive according as\r\n     the policy has been offensive or defensive. An offensive and\r\n     defensive policy is in its turn indicated by the line of\r\n     conduct dictated historically. We see this very clearly in\r\n     antiquity by the example furnished us in the Persians and\r\n     Romans. In their wars we see the strategical role following\r\n     the bend of the historical role. The people which in its\r\n     historical development has arrived at the stage of inertia, or\r\n     even retrogression, will not carry on a policy of offence, but\r\n     merely one of defence; a nation in that situation will wait to\r\n     be attacked, and its strategy will consequently be defensive,\r\n     and from a defensive strategy will follow necessarily a\r\n     defensive tactic.\r\n\r\nLord Esher has expressed a like thought.[51]\r\n\r\nBut whether wars result from sheer temper, national \"hot fits,\" or not,\r\nit is quite certain that the lengthy preparation for war, the condition\r\nof armed peace, the burden of armaments which is almost worse than an\r\noccasional war, does not result therefrom.\r\n\r\nThe paraphernalia of war in the modern world cannot be improvised on the\r\nspur of the moment to meet each gust of ill-feeling, and be dropped when\r\nit is over. The building of battleships, the discussion of budgets and\r\nthe voting of them, the training of armies, the preparation of a\r\ncampaign, are a long business, and more and more in our day does each\r\ndistinctive campaign involve a special and distinctive preparation. The\r\npundits declare that the German battleships have been especially built\r\nwith a view to work in the North Sea. In any case, we know that the\r\nconflict with Germany has been going on for ten years. This is surely a\r\nrather prolonged \"hot fit.\" The truth is that war in the modern world is\r\nthe outcome of armed peace, and involves, with all its elaborate\r\nmachinery of yearly budgets, and slowly built warships and forts, and\r\nslowly trained armies, fixity of policy and purpose extending over\r\nyears, and sometimes generations. Men do not make these sacrifices month\r\nafter month, year after year, pay taxes, and upset Governments and fight\r\nin Parliament for a mere passing whim; and as conflicts necessarily\r\nbecome more scientific, we shall in the nature of things be forced to\r\nprepare everything more thoroughly, and have clearer and sounder ideas\r\nas to their essence, their cause, and their effects, and to watch more\r\nclosely their relation to national motive and policy. The final\r\njustification for all these immense, humdrum, workaday sacrifices must\r\nbe more and more national well-being.\r\n\r\nThis does not imply, as some critics allege, the conclusion that an\r\nEnglishman is to say: \"Since I might be just as well off under the\r\nGermans, let them come\"; but that the German will say: \"Since I shall be\r\nno better off for the going, I will not go.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, the case of the authorities cited in the preceding chapter is\r\nmarked by a false form of statement. Those who plead for war on moral\r\ngrounds say: \"War will go on because men will defend their ideals,\r\nmoral, political, social, and religious.\" It should be stated thus: \"War\r\nwill go on because men will always attack the spiritual possessions of\r\nother men,\" because, of course, the necessity for defence arises from\r\nthe fact that these possessions are in danger of attack.\r\n\r\nPut in the second form, however, the case breaks down almost of itself.\r\nThe least informed of us realizes that the whole trend of history is\r\nagainst the tendency for men to attack the ideals and the beliefs of\r\nother men. In the religious domain that tendency is plain, so much so\r\nthat the imposition of religious ideals or beliefs by force has\r\npractically been abandoned in Europe, and the causes which have wrought\r\nthis change of attitude in the European mind are just as operative in\r\nthe field of politics.\r\n\r\nThose causes have been, in the religious field, of a twofold nature,\r\nboth having direct bearing on the problem with which we are dealing. The\r\nfirst cause is that at which I have already hinted, the general shifting\r\nof the ideals from sterile aims to those concerned with the improvement\r\nof society; the second one being that development of communication which\r\nhas destroyed the spiritual homogeneity of States.\r\n\r\nA given movement of religious opinion is not confined to one State,\r\ntransforming it completely, while another current of opinion transforms\r\ncompletely in another sense another State; but it goes on piecemeal,\r\n_pari passu_, in the various States. Very early in the religious\r\ndevelopment of Europe there ceased to be such a thing as a purely\r\nCatholic or a purely Protestant State: the religious struggle went on\r\ninside the political frontiers--between the people of the same State.\r\nThe struggle of political and social ideas must take a like course.\r\nThose struggles of ideas will be carried out, not between States, but\r\nbetween different groups in the same State, those groups acting in\r\nintellectual co-operation with corresponding groups in other States.\r\nThis intellectual co-operation across frontiers is a necessary outcome\r\nof the similar economic co-operation athwart frontiers which the\r\nphysical division of labor, owing to the development of communication,\r\nhas set up. It has become impossible for the army of a State to embody\r\nthe fight for an ideal, for the simple reason that the great moral\r\nquestions of our time can no longer be postulated in national terms.\r\nWhat follows will make this plain.\r\n\r\nThere remains a final moral claim for war: that it is a needed moral\r\ndiscipline for nations, the supreme test for the survival of the\r\nfittest.\r\n\r\nIn the first chapter of this section, I have pointed out the importance\r\nof this plea in determining the general character of European public\r\nopinion, on which alone depends the survival or the disappearance of the\r\nmilitarist regimen. Yet in strict logic there is no need to rebut this\r\nclaim in detail at all, for only a small fraction of those who believe\r\nin it have the courage of their convictions.\r\n\r\nThe defender of large armaments always justifies his position on the\r\nground that such armaments ensure peace. _Si vis pacem_, etc. As between\r\nwar and peace he has made his choice, and he has chosen, as the definite\r\nobject of his endeavors, peace. Having directed his efforts to secure\r\npeace, he must accept whatever disadvantages there may lie in that\r\nstate. He is prepared to admit that, of the two states, peace is\r\npreferable, and it is peace towards which our efforts should be\r\ndirected. Having decided on that aim, what utility is there in showing\r\nthat it is an undesirable one?\r\n\r\nWe must, as a matter of fact, be honest for our opponent. We must assume\r\nthat in an alternative, where his action would determine the issue of\r\nwar or peace, he will allow that action to be influenced by the general\r\nconsideration that war might make for the moral advantage of his\r\ncountry. More important even than this consideration is that of the\r\ngeneral national temper, to which his philosophy, however little in\r\nkeeping with his professed policy and desire, necessarily gives rise.\r\nFor these reasons it is worth while to consider in detail the biological\r\ncase which he presents.\r\n\r\nThe illusion underlying that case arises from the indiscriminate\r\napplication of scientific formulae.\r\n\r\nStruggle is the law of survival with man, as elsewhere, but it is the\r\nstruggle of man with the universe, not man with man. Dog does not eat\r\ndog--even tigers do not live on one another. Both dogs and tigers live\r\nupon their prey.\r\n\r\nIt is true that as against this it is argued that dogs struggle with one\r\nanother for the same prey--if the supply of food runs short the weakest\r\ndog, or the weakest tiger, starves. But an analogy between this state\r\nand one in which co-operation is a direct means of increasing the supply\r\nof food, obviously breaks down. If dogs and tigers were groups,\r\norganized on the basis of the division of labor, even the weak dogs and\r\ntigers could, conceivably, perform functions which would increase the\r\nfood supply of the group as a whole, and, conceivably, their existence\r\nwould render the security of that supply greater than would their\r\nelimination. If to-day a territory like England supports in comfort, a\r\npopulation of 45,000,000, where in other times rival groups, numbering\r\nat most two or three millions, found themselves struggling with one\r\nanother for a bare subsistence, the greater quantity of food and the\r\ngreater security of the supply is not due to any process of elimination\r\nof Wessex men by Northumbrian men, but is due precisely to the fact that\r\nthis rivalry has been replaced by common action against their prey, the\r\nforces of nature. The obvious facts of the development of communities\r\nshow that there is a progressive replacement of rivalry by co-operation,\r\nand that the vitality of the social organism increases in direct ratio\r\nto the efficiency of the co-operation, and to the abandonment of the\r\nrivalry, between its parts.[52]\r\n\r\nAll crude analogies between the processes of plant and animal survival\r\nand social survival are vitiated, therefore, by disregarding the dynamic\r\nelement of conscious co-operation.\r\n\r\nThat mankind as a whole represents the organism and the planet the\r\nenvironment, to which he is more and more adapting himself, is the only\r\nconclusion that consorts with the facts. If struggle between men is the\r\ntrue reading of the law of life, those facts are absolutely\r\ninexplicable, for he is drifting away from conflict, from the use of\r\nphysical force, and towards co-operation. This much is unchallengeable,\r\nas the facts which follow will show.\r\n\r\nBut in that case, if struggle for extermination of rivals between men is\r\nthe law of life, mankind is setting at naught the natural law, and must\r\nbe on the way to extinction.\r\n\r\nHappily the natural law in this matter has been misread. The individual\r\nin his sociological aspect is not the complete organism. He who attempts\r\nto live without association with his fellows dies. Nor is the nation the\r\ncomplete organism. If Britain attempted to live without co-operation\r\nwith other nations, half the population would starve. The completer the\r\nco-operation the greater the vitality; the more imperfect the\r\nco-operation the less the vitality. Now, a body, the various parts of\r\nwhich are so interdependent that without co-ordination vitality is\r\nreduced or death ensures, must be regarded, in so far as the functions\r\nin question are concerned, not as a collection of rival organisms, but\r\nas one. This is in accord with what we know of the character of living\r\norganisms in their conflict with environment. The higher the organism,\r\nthe greater the elaboration and interdependence of its part, the\r\ngreater the need for co-ordination.[53]\r\n\r\nIf we take this as the reading of the biological law, the whole thing\r\nbecomes plain; man's irresistible drift away from conflict and towards\r\nco-operation is but the completer adaptation of the organism (man) to\r\nits environment (the planet, wild nature), resulting in a more intense\r\nvitality.\r\n\r\nThe psychological development involved in man's struggle along these\r\nlines may best be stated by an outline sketch of the character of his\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nWhen I kill my prisoner (cannibalism was a very common characteristic of\r\nearly man), it is in \"human nature\" to keep him for my own larder\r\nwithout sharing him. It is the extreme form of the use of force, the\r\nextreme form of human individualism. But putrefaction sets in before I\r\ncan consume him (it is as well to recall these real difficulties of the\r\nearly man, because, of course, \"human nature does not change\"), and I am\r\nleft without food.\r\n\r\nBut my two neighbors, each with his butchered prisoner, are in a similar\r\ndifficulty, and though I could quite easily defend my larder, we deem it\r\nbetter on the next occasion to join forces and kill one prisoner at a\r\ntime. I share mine with the other two; they share theirs with me. There\r\nis no waste through putrefaction. It is the earliest form of the\r\nsurrender of the use of force in favor of co-operation--the first\r\nattenuation of the tendency to act on impulse. But when the three\r\nprisoners are consumed, and no more happen to be available, it strikes\r\nus that on the whole we should have done better to make them catch game\r\nand dig roots for us. The next prisoners that are caught are not\r\nkilled--a further diminution of impulse and the factor of physical\r\nforce--they are only enslaved, and the pugnacity which in the first case\r\nwent to kill them is now diverted to keeping them at work. But the\r\npugnacity is so little controlled by rationalism that the slaves starve,\r\nand prove incapable of useful work. They are better treated; there is a\r\ndiminution of pugnacity. They become sufficiently manageable for the\r\nmasters themselves, while the slaves are digging roots, to do a little\r\nhunting. The pugnacity recently expended on the slaves is redirected to\r\nkeeping hostile tribes from capturing them--a difficult matter, because\r\nthe slaves themselves show a disposition to try a change of mastership.\r\nThey are bribed into good behavior by better treatment: a further\r\ndiminution of force, a further drift towards co-operation; they give\r\nlabor, we give food and protection. As the tribes enlarge, it is found\r\nthat those have most cohesion where the position of slaves is recognized\r\nby definite rights and privileges. Slavery becomes serfdom or villeiny.\r\nThe lord gives land and protection, the serf labor and military service:\r\na further drift from force, a further drift towards co-operation,\r\nexchange. With the introduction of money even the form of force\r\ndisappears: the laborer pays rent and the lord pays his soldiers. It is\r\nfree exchange on both sides, and economic force has replaced physical\r\nforce. The further the drift from force towards simple economic interest\r\nthe better the result for the effort expended. The Tartar khan, who\r\nseizes by force the wealth in his State, giving no adequate return, soon\r\nhas none to seize. Men will not work to create what they cannot enjoy,\r\nso that, finally, the khan has to kill a man by torture in order to\r\nobtain a sum which is the thousandth part of what a London tradesman\r\nwill spend to secure a title carrying no right to the exercise of force\r\nfrom a Sovereign who has lost all right to the use or exercise of\r\nphysical force, the head of the wealthiest country in the world, the\r\nsources of whose wealth are the most removed from any process involving\r\nthe exercise of physical force.\r\n\r\nBut while this process is going on inside the tribe, or group, or\r\nnation, force and hostility as between differing tribes or nations\r\nremain; but not undiminished. At first it suffices for the fuzzy head of\r\na rival tradesman to appear above the bushes for primitive man to want\r\nto hit it. He is a foreigner: kill him. Later, he only wants to kill him\r\nif he is at war with his tribe. There are periods of peace: diminution\r\nof hostility. In the first conflicts all of the other tribe are\r\nkilled--men, women, and children. Force and pugnacity are absolute. But\r\nthe use of slaves, both as laborers and as concubines, attentuates\r\nthis; there is a diminution of force. The women of the hostile tribe\r\nbear children by the conqueror: there is a diminution of pugnacity. At\r\nthe next raid into the hostile territory it is found that there is\r\nnothing to take, because everything has been killed or carried off. So\r\non later raids the conqueror kills the chiefs only (a further diminution\r\nof pugnacity, a further drift from mere impulse), or merely dispossesses\r\nthem of their lands, which he divides among his followers (Norman\r\nConquest type). We have already passed the stage of extermination.[54]\r\nThe conqueror simply absorbs the conquered--or the conquered absorbs\r\nthe conqueror, whichever you like. It is no longer the case of one\r\ngobbling up the other. Neither is gobbled. In the next stage we do not\r\neven dispossess the chiefs--a further sacrifice of physical force--we\r\nmerely impose tribute. But the conquering nation soon finds itself in\r\nthe position of the khan in his own State--the more he squeezes the less\r\nhe gets, until, finally, the cost of getting the money by military means\r\nexceeds what is obtained. It was the case of Spain in Spanish\r\nAmerica--the more territory she \"owned\" the poorer she became. The wise\r\nconqueror, then, finds that better than the exaction of tribute is an\r\nexclusive market--old English colonial type. But in the process of\r\nensuring exclusiveness more is lost than is gained: the colonies are\r\nallowed to choose their own system--further drift from the use of force,\r\nfurther drift from hostility and pugnacity. Final result: complete\r\nabandonment of physical force, co-operation on basis of mutual profit\r\nthe only relationship, with reference not merely to colonies which have\r\nbecome in fact foreign States, but also to States foreign in name as\r\nwell as in fact. We have arrived not at the intensification of the\r\nstruggle between men, but at a condition of vital dependence upon the\r\nprosperity of foreigners. Could England by some magic kill all\r\nforeigners, half the British population would starve. This is not a\r\ncondition making indefinitely for hostility to foreigners; still less\r\nis it a condition in which such hostility finds its justification in any\r\nreal instinct of self-preservation or in any deep-seated biological law.\r\nWith each new intensification of dependence between the parts of the\r\norganism must go that psychological development which has marked every\r\nstage of the progress in the past, from the day that we killed our\r\nprisoner in order to eat him, and refused to share him with our fellow,\r\nto the day that the telegraph and the bank have rendered military force\r\neconomically futile.\r\n\r\nBut the foregoing does not include all the facts, or all the factors. If\r\nRussia does England an injury--sinks a fishing fleet in time of peace,\r\nfor instance--it is no satisfaction to Englishmen to go out and kill a\r\nlot of Frenchmen or Irishmen. They want to kill Russians. If, however,\r\nthey knew a little less geography--if, for instance, they were Chinese\r\nBoxers, it would not matter in the least which they killed, because to\r\nthe Chinaman all alike are \"foreign devils\"; his knowledge of the case\r\ndoes not enable him to differentiate between the various nationalities\r\nof Europeans. In the case of a wronged negro in the Congo the collective\r\nresponsibility is still wider; for a wrong inflicted by one white man he\r\nwill avenge himself on any other--American, German, English, French,\r\nDutch, Belgian, or Chinese. As our knowledge increases, our sense of the\r\ncollective responsibility of outside groups narrows. But immediately we\r\nstart on this differentiation there is no stopping. The English yokel is\r\nsatisfied if he can \"get a whack at them foreigners\"--Germans will do\r\nif Russians are not available. The more educated man wants Russians; but\r\nif he stops a moment longer, he will see that in killing Russian\r\npeasants he might as well be killing so many Hindoos, for all they had\r\nto do with the matter. He then wants to get at the Russian Government.\r\nBut so do a great many Russians--Liberals, Reformers, etc. He then sees\r\nthat the real conflict is not English against Russians at all, but the\r\ninterest of all law-abiding folk--Russian and English alike--against\r\noppression, corruption, and incompetence. To give the Russian Government\r\nan opportunity of going to war would only strengthen its hands against\r\nthose with whom he was in sympathy--the Reformers. As war would increase\r\nthe influence of the reactionary party in Russia, it would do nothing to\r\nprevent the recurrence of such incidents, and so quite the wrong party\r\nwould suffer. Were the real facts and the real responsibilities\r\nunderstood, a Liberal people would reply to such an aggression by taking\r\nevery means which the social and economic relationship of the two States\r\nafforded to enable Russian Liberals to hang a few Russian Admirals and\r\nestablish a Russian Liberal Government. In any case, the realization of\r\nthe fact attenuates hostility. In the same way, as they become more\r\nfamiliar with the facts, the English will attenuate their hostility to\r\n\"Germans.\" An English patriot recently said, \"We must smash\r\nPrussianism.\" The majority of Germans are in cordial agreement with him,\r\nand are working to that end. But if England went to war for that\r\npurpose, Germans would be compelled to fight for Prussianism. War\r\nbetween States for a political ideal of this kind is not only futile, it\r\nis the sure means of perpetuating the very condition which it would\r\nbring to an end. International hostilities repose for the most part upon\r\nour conception of the foreign State, with which we are quarrelling, as a\r\nhomogeneous personality, having the same character of responsibility as\r\nan individual, whereas the variety of interests, both material and\r\nmoral, regardless of State boundaries, renders the analogy between\r\nnations and individuals an utterly false one.\r\n\r\nIndeed, when the co-operation between the parts of the social organism\r\nis as complete as our mechanical development has recently made it, it is\r\nimpossible to fix the limits not merely of the economic interests, but\r\nof the moral interest of the community, and to say what is one community\r\nand what is another. Certainly the State limits no longer define the\r\nlimits of the community; and yet it is only the State limits which\r\ninternational antagonism predicates. If the Louisiana cotton crop fails,\r\na part of Lancashire starves. There is closer community of interest in a\r\nvital matter between Lancashire and Louisiana than between Louisiana\r\nand, say, Iowa, parts of the same State. There is much closer\r\nintercommunication between Britain and the United States in all that\r\ntouches social and moral development than between Britain and, say,\r\nBengal, part of the same State. An English nobleman has more community\r\nof thought and feeling with a European continental aristocrat (will\r\nmarry his daughter, for instance) than he would think of claiming with\r\nsuch \"fellow\" British countrymen as a Bengal Babu, a Jamaica negro, or\r\neven a Dorset yokel. A professor at Oxford will have closer community of\r\nfeeling with a member of the French Academy than with, say, a\r\nWhitechapel publican. One may go further, and say that a British subject\r\nof Quebec has closer contact with Paris than with London; the British\r\nsubject of Dutch-speaking Africa with Holland than with England; the\r\nBritish subject of Hong Kong with Pekin than with London; of Egypt, with\r\nConstantinople than with London, and so on. In a thousand respects,\r\nassociation cuts across State boundaries, which are purely conventional,\r\nand renders the biological division of mankind into independent and\r\nwarring States a scientific ineptitude.\r\n\r\nAllied factors, introduced by the character of modern intercourse, have\r\nalready gone far to render territorial conquest futile for the\r\nsatisfaction of natural human pride and vanity. Just as in the economic\r\nsphere, factors peculiar to our generation have rendered the old analogy\r\nbetween States and persons a false one, so do these factors render the\r\nanalogy in the sentimental sphere a false one. While the individual of\r\ngreat possessions does in fact obtain, by reason of his wealth, a\r\ndeference which satisfies his pride and vanity, the individual of the\r\ngreat nation has no such sentimental advantage as against the citizen of\r\nthe small nation. No one thinks of respecting the Russian mujik because\r\nhe belongs to a great nation, or despising a Scandinavian or Belgian\r\ngentleman because he belongs to a small one; and any society will accord\r\nprestige to the nobleman of Norway, Holland, Belgium, Spain, or even\r\nPortugal, which it refuses to an American \"Climber.\" The nobleman of any\r\ncountry will marry the noblewoman of another more readily than a woman\r\nfrom a lower class of his own country. The prestige of the foreign\r\ncountry rarely counts for anything in the matter, when it comes to the\r\nreal facts of everyday life, so shallow is the real sentiment which now\r\ndivides States. Just as in material things community of interest and\r\nrelationship cut clear across State boundaries, so inevitably will the\r\npsychic community of interest come so to do.\r\n\r\nJust as, in the material domain, the real biological law, which is\r\nassociation and co-operation between individuals of the same species in\r\nthe struggle with their environment, has pushed men in their material\r\nstruggle to conform with that law, so will it do so in the sentimental\r\nsphere. We shall come to realize that the real psychic and moral\r\ndivisions are not as between nations, but as between opposing\r\nconceptions of life. Even admitting that man's nature will never lose\r\nthe combativeness, hostility, and animosity which are so large a part of\r\nit (although the manifestations of such feelings have so greatly changed\r\nwithin the historical period as almost to have changed in character),\r\nwhat we shall see is the diversion of those psychological qualities to\r\nthe real, instead of the artificial, conflict of mankind. We shall see\r\nthat at the bottom of any conflict between the armies or Governments of\r\nGermany and England lies not the opposition of \"German\" interests to\r\n\"English\" interests, but the conflict in both States between democracy\r\nand autocracy, or between Socialism and Individualism, or reaction and\r\nprogress, however one's sociological sympathies may classify it. That is\r\nthe real division in both countries, and for Germans to conquer English,\r\nor English Germans, would not advance the solution of such a conflict\r\none iota; and as such conflict becomes more acute, the German\r\nindividualist will see that it is more important to protect his freedom\r\nand property against the Socialist and trade unionist, who can and do\r\nattack them, than against the British Army, which cannot. In the same\r\nway the British Tory will be more concerned with what Mr. Lloyd George's\r\nBudgets can do than with what the Germans can do.[55] From the\r\nrealization of these things to the realization on the part of the\r\nBritish democrat that what stands in the way of his securing for social\r\nexpenditure enormous sums, that now go to armaments, is mainly a lack of\r\nco-operation between himself and the democrats of a hostile nation who\r\nare in a like case, is but a step, and a step that, if history has any\r\nmeaning, is bound shortly to be taken. When it is taken, property,\r\ncapital, Individualism will have to give to its international\r\norganization, already far-reaching, a still more definite form, in which\r\ninternational differences will play no part. And when that condition is\r\nreached, both peoples will find inconceivable the idea that artificial\r\nState divisions (which are coming more and more to approximate to mere\r\nadministrative divisions, leaving free scope within them or across them\r\nfor the development of genuine nationality) could ever in any way define\r\nthe real conflicts of mankind.\r\n\r\nThere remains, of course, the question of time; that these developments\r\nwill take \"thousands\" or \"hundreds\" of years. Yet the interdependence of\r\nmodern nations is the growth of little more than fifty years. A century\r\nago England could have been self-supporting, and little the worse for\r\nit. One must not overlook the Law of Acceleration. The age of man on the\r\nearth is placed variously at from thirty thousand to three hundred\r\nthousand years. He has in some respects developed more in the last two\r\nhundred years than in all the preceding ages. We see more change now in\r\nten years than originally in ten thousand. Who shall foretell the\r\ndevelopments of a generation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nUNCHANGING HUMAN NATURE\r\n\r\n    The progress from cannibalism to Herbert Spencer--The disappearance\r\n    of religious oppression by government--Disappearance of the\r\n    duel--The Crusaders and the Holy Sepulchre--The wail of militarist\r\n    writers at man's drift away from militancy.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of us who have had occasion to discuss this subject are familiar\r\nwith the catch-phrases with which the whole matter is so often\r\ndismissed. \"You cannot change human nature,\" \"What man always has been\r\nduring thousands of years, he always will be,\" are the sort of dicta\r\ngenerally delivered as self-evident propositions that do not need\r\ndiscussion. Or if, in deference to the fact that very profound changes,\r\nin which human nature is involved, _have_ taken place in the habits of\r\nmankind, the statement of the proposition is somewhat less dogmatic, we\r\nare given to understand that any serious modification of the tendency to\r\ngo to war can only be looked for in \"thousands of years.\"\r\n\r\nWhat are the facts? They are these:\r\n\r\nThat the alleged unchangeability of human nature in this matter is not\r\nborne out; that man's pugnacity though not disappearing, is very\r\nvisibly, under the forces of mechanical and social development, being\r\ntransformed and diverted from ends that are wasteful and destructive to\r\nends that are less wasteful, which render easier that co-operation\r\nbetween men in the struggle with their environment which is the\r\ncondition of their survival and advance; that changes which, in the\r\nhistorical period, have been extraordinarily rapid are necessarily\r\nquickening--quickening in geometrical rather than in arithmetical ratio.\r\n\r\nWith very great courtesy, one is impelled to ask those who argue that\r\nhuman nature in all its manifestations must remain unchanged how they\r\ninterpret history. We have seen man progress from the mere animal\r\nfighting with other animals, seizing his food by force, seizing also by\r\nforce his females, eating his own kind, the sons of the family\r\nstruggling with the father for the possession of the father's wives; we\r\nhave seen this incoherent welter of animal struggle at least partly\r\nabandoned for settled industry, and partly surviving as a more organized\r\ntribal warfare or a more ordered pillaging, like that of the Vikings and\r\nthe Huns; we have seen even these pillagers abandon in part their\r\npillaging for ordered industry, and in part for the more ceremonial\r\nconflict of feudal struggle; we have seen even the feudal conflict\r\nabandoned in favor of dynastic and religious and territorial conflict,\r\nand then dynastic and religious conflict abandoned. There remains now\r\nonly the conflict of States, and that, too, at a time when the character\r\nand conception of the State are being profoundly modified.\r\n\r\nHuman nature may not change, whatever that vague phrase may mean; but\r\nhuman nature is a complex factor. It includes numberless motives, many\r\nof which are modified in relation to the rest as circumstances change;\r\nso that the manifestations of human nature change out of all\r\nrecognition. Do we mean by the phrase that \"human nature does not\r\nchange\" that the feelings of the paleolithic man who ate the bodies of\r\nhis enemies and of his own children are the same as those of a Herbert\r\nSpencer, or even of the modern New Yorker who catches his subway train\r\nto business in the morning? If human nature does not change, may we\r\ntherefore expect the city clerk to brain his mother and serve her up for\r\ndinner, or suppose that Lord Roberts or Lord Kitchener is in the habit,\r\nwhile on campaign, of catching the babies of his enemies on spear-heads,\r\nor driving his motor-car over the bodies of young girls, like the\r\nleaders of the old Northmen in their ox-wagons.\r\n\r\nWhat _do_ these phrases mean? These, and many like them, are repeated in\r\na knowing way with an air of great wisdom and profundity by journalists\r\nand writers of repute, and one may find them blatant any day in our\r\nnewspapers and reviews; yet the most cursory examination proves them to\r\nbe neither wise nor profound, but simply parrot-like catch-phrases which\r\nlack common sense, and fly in the face of facts of everyday experience.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the facts of the world as they stare us in the face\r\nshow that, in our common attitude, we not only overlook the\r\nmodifications in human nature, which have occurred historically since\r\nyesterday--occurred even in our generation--but we also ignore the\r\nmodification of human nature which mere differences of social habit and\r\ncustom and outlook effect. Take the case of the duel. Even educated\r\npeople in Germany, France, and Italy, will tell you that it is \"not in\r\nhuman nature\" to expect a man of gentle birth to abandon the habit of\r\nthe duel; the notion that honorable people should ever so place their\r\nhonor at the mercy of whoever may care to insult them is, they assure\r\nyou, both childish and sordid. With them the matter will not bear\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nYet the great societies which exist in England, North America,\r\nAustralia--the whole Anglo-Saxon world, in fact--have abandoned the\r\nduel, and we cannot lump the whole Anglo-Saxon race as either sordid or\r\nchildish.\r\n\r\nThat such a change as this, which must have conflicted with human\r\npugnacity in its most insidious form,--pride and personal vanity, the\r\ntraditions of an aristocratic status, every one of the psychological\r\nfactors now involved in international conflict--has been effected in our\r\nown generation should surely give pause to those who dismiss as\r\nchimerical any hope that rationalism will ever dominate the conduct of\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nDiscussing the impossibility of allowing arbitration to cover all causes\r\nof difference, Mr. Roosevelt remarked, in justification of large\r\narmaments: \"We despise a nation, just as we despise a man, who fails to\r\nresent an insult.\"[56] Mr. Roosevelt seems to forget that the duel with\r\nus is extinct. Do _we_, the English-speaking people of the world, to\r\nwhom presumably Mr. Roosevelt must have been referring, despise a man\r\nwho fails to resent an insult by arms? Would we not, on the contrary,\r\ndespise the man who should do so? Yet so recent is this charge that it\r\nhas not yet reached the majority of Europeans.\r\n\r\nThe vague talk of national honor, as a quality under the especial\r\nprotection of the soldier, shows, perhaps more clearly than aught else,\r\nhow much our notions concerning international politics have fallen\r\nbehind the notions that dominate us in everyday life. When an individual\r\nbegins to rave about his honor, we may be pretty sure he is about to do\r\nsome irrational, most likely some disreputable deed. The word is like an\r\noath, serving with its vague yet large meaning to intoxicate the fancy.\r\nIts vagueness and elasticity make it possible to regard a given\r\nincident, at will, as either harmless or a _casus belli_. Our sense of\r\nproportion in these matters approximates to that of the schoolboy. The\r\npassing jeer of a foreign journalist, a foolish cartoon, is sufficient\r\nto start the dogs of war baying up and down the land.[57] We call it\r\n\"maintaining the national prestige,\" \"enforcing respect,\" and I know not\r\nwhat other high-sounding name. It amounts to the same thing in the end.\r\n\r\nThe one distinctive advance in civil society achieved by the Anglo-Saxon\r\nworld is fairly betokened by the passing away of this old notion of a\r\npeculiar possession in the way of honor, which has to be guarded by\r\narms. It stands out as the one clear moral gain of the nineteenth\r\ncentury; and, when we observe the notion resurging in the minds of men,\r\nwe may reasonably expect to find that it marks one of those reversions\r\nin development which so often occur in the realm of mind as well as in\r\nthat of organic forms.\r\n\r\nTwo or three generations since, this progress, even among Anglo-Saxons,\r\ntowards a rational standard of conduct in this matter, as between\r\nindividuals, would have seemed as unreasonable as do the hopes of\r\ninternational peace in our day. Even to-day the continental officer is\r\nas firmly convinced as ever that the maintenance of personal dignity is\r\nimpossible save by the help of the duel. He will ask in triumph, \"What\r\nwill you do if one of your own order openly insults you? Can you\r\npreserve your self-respect by summoning him to the police-court?\" And\r\nthe question is taken as settling the matter offhand.\r\n\r\nThe survival, where national prestige is concerned, of the standards of\r\nthe _code duello_ is daily brought before us by the rhetoric of the\r\npatriots. Our army and our navy, not the good faith of our statesmen,\r\nare the \"guardians of our national honor.\" Like the duellist, the\r\npatriot would have us believe that a dishonorable act is made honorable\r\nif the party suffering by the dishonor be killed. The patriot is careful\r\nto withdraw from the operation of possible arbitration all questions\r\nwhich could affect the \"national honor.\" An \"insult to the flag\" must be\r\n\"wiped out in blood.\" Small nations, which in the nature of the case\r\ncannot so resent the insults of great empires, have apparently no right\r\nto such a possession as \"honor.\" It is the peculiar prerogative of\r\nworld-wide empires. The patriots who would thus resent \"insults to the\r\nflag\" may well be asked whether they would condemn the conduct of the\r\nGerman lieutenant who kills the unarmed civilian in cold blood \"for the\r\nhonor of the uniform.\"\r\n\r\nIt does not seem to have struck the patriot that, as personal dignity\r\nand conduct have not suffered but been improved by the abandonment of\r\nthe principle of the duel, there is little reason to suppose that\r\ninternational conduct, or national dignity, would suffer by a similar\r\nchange of standards.\r\n\r\nThe whole philosophy underlying the duel, where personal relations are\r\nconcerned, excites in our day the infinite derision of all Anglo-Saxons.\r\nYet these same Anglo-Saxons maintain it as rigorously as ever in the\r\nrelations of States.\r\n\r\nProfound as is the change involved in the Anglo-Saxon abandonment of the\r\nduel, a still more universal change, affecting still more nearly our\r\npsychological impulses, has been effected within a relatively recent\r\nhistorical period. I refer to the abandonment, by the Governments of\r\nEurope, of their right to prescribe the religious belief of their\r\ncitizens. For hundreds of years, generation after generation, it was\r\nregarded as an evident part of a ruler's right and duty to dictate what\r\nhis subjects should believe.\r\n\r\nAs Lecky has pointed out, the preoccupation which, for numberless\r\ngenerations, was the centre round which all other interests revolved has\r\nsimply and purely disappeared; coalitions which were once the most\r\nserious occupation of statesmen now exist only in the speculations of\r\nthe expounders of prophecy. Among all the elements of affinity and\r\nrepulsion that regulate the combinations of nations, dogmatic influences\r\nwhich were once supreme can scarcely be said to exist. There is a change\r\nhere reaching down into the most fundamental impulses of the human mind.\r\n\"Until the seventeenth century every mental discussion, which philosophy\r\npronounces to be essential to legitimate research, was almost uniformly\r\nbranded as a sin, and a large proportion of the most deadly intellectual\r\nvices were deliberately inculcated as virtues.\"\r\n\r\nAnyone who argued that the differences between Catholics and Protestants\r\nwere not such as force could settle, and that the time would come when\r\nman would realize this truth, and regard a religious war between\r\nEuropean States as a wild and unimaginable anachronism, would have been\r\nput down as a futile doctrinaire, completely ignoring the most\r\nelementary facts of \"unchanging human nature.\"\r\n\r\nThere is one striking incident of the religious struggle of States which\r\nillustrates vividly the change which has come over the spirit of man.\r\nFor nearly two hundred years Christians fought the Infidel for the\r\nconquest of the Holy Sepulchre. All the nations of Europe joined in this\r\ngreat endeavor. It seemed to be the one thing which could unite them,\r\nand for generations, so profound was the impulse which produced the\r\nmovement, the struggle went on. There is nothing in history, perhaps,\r\nquite comparable to it. Suppose that during this struggle one had told a\r\nEuropean statesman of that age that the time would come when, assembled\r\nin a room, the representatives of a Europe, which had made itself the\r\nabsolute master of the Infidel, could by a single stroke of the pen\r\nsecure the Holy Sepulchre for all time to Christendom, but that, having\r\ndiscussed the matter cursorily twenty minutes or so, they would decide\r\nthat on the whole it was not worth while! Had such a thing been told to\r\na mediaeval statesman, he would certainly have regarded the prophecy as\r\nthat of a madman. Yet this, of course, is precisely what has taken\r\nplace.[58]\r\n\r\nA glance over the common incidents of Europe's history will show the\r\nprofound change which has visibly taken place, not only in the minds,\r\nbut in the hearts of men. Things which even in our stage of civilization\r\nwould no longer be possible, owing to that change in human nature which\r\nthe military dogmatist denies, were commonplace incidents with our\r\ngrandfathers. Indeed, the modifications in the religious attitude just\r\ntouched on assuredly arise from an emotional as much as from an\r\nintellectual change. A theology which could declare that the unborn\r\nchild would suffer eternal torment in the fires of hell for no crime,\r\nother than that of its conception, would be in our day impossible on\r\nmerely emotional grounds.[59] What was once deemed a mere truism would\r\nnow be viewed with horror and indignation. Again, as Lecky says, \"For a\r\ngreat change has silently swept over Christendom. Without disturbance,\r\nan old doctrine has passed away from among the realizations of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nNot only in the religious sphere do we see this progress. In a\r\ncivilization, which was in many respects an admirable one, it was\r\npossible for 400 slaves to be slaughtered because one of them had\r\ncommitted some offence; for a lady of fashion to gratify a momentary\r\ncaprice by ordering a slave to be crucified; and, a generation or two\r\nsince, for whole populations to turn torture into a public amusement[60]\r\nand a public festival; for kings, historically yesterday, to assist\r\npersonally at the tortures of persons accused of witchcraft. It is\r\nrelated by Pitcairn, in his \"Criminal Trials of Scotland,\" that James I.\r\nof Scotland personally presided over the tortures of one, Dr. Fian,\r\naccused of having caused a storm at sea. The bones of the prisoner's\r\nlegs were broken into small pieces in the boot, and it was the King\r\nhimself who suggested the following variation and witnessed the\r\nexecution of it: the nails of both hands were seized by a pair of\r\npincers and torn from the fingers, and into the bleeding stump of each\r\nfinger two needles were thrust up to their heads!\r\n\r\nDoes anyone seriously contend that the conditions of modern life have\r\nnot modified psychology in these matters? Does anyone seriously deny\r\nthat our wider outlook, which is the result of somewhat larger\r\nconceptions and wider reading, has wrought such a change that the\r\nrepetition of things like these in London, or in Edinburgh, or in\r\nBerlin, has become impossible?\r\n\r\nOr, is it seriously argued that we may witness a repetition of these\r\nevents, that we are quite capable at any moment of taking pleasure in\r\nburning alive a beautiful child? Does the Catholic or the Protestant\r\nreally stand in danger of such things from his religious rival? If human\r\nnature is unchanged by the progress of ideas, then he does, and Europe's\r\ngeneral adoption of religious freedom is a mistake, and each sect should\r\narm against the other in the old way, and the only real hope of\r\nreligious peace and safety is in the domination of an absolutely\r\nuniversal Church. This was, indeed, the plea of the old inquisitor, just\r\nas it is the plea of the _Spectator_ to-day, that the only hope of\r\npolitical peace is in the domination of an absolutely universal power:\r\n\r\n     There is only one way to end war and preparation for war, and\r\n     that is, as we have said, by a universal monarchy. If we can\r\n     imagine one country--let us say Russia for the sake of\r\n     argument--so powerful that she could disarm the rest of the\r\n     world, and then maintain a force big enough to forbid any Power\r\n     to invade the rights of any other Power ... no doubt we should\r\n     have universal peace.[61]\r\n\r\nThis dictum recalls one, equally emphatic, once voiced by a colleague of\r\nthe late Procurator of the Holy Synod in Russia, who said:\r\n\r\n     There is only one way to ensure religious peace in the State,\r\n     to compel all in that State to conform to the State religion.\r\n     Those that will not conform must, in the interests of peace, be\r\n     driven out.\r\n\r\nMr. Lecky, who of all authors has written most suggestively, perhaps, on\r\nthe disappearance of religious persecution, has pointed out that the\r\nstrife between opposing religious bodies arose out of a religious spirit\r\nwhich, though often high-minded and disinterested (he protests with\r\nenergy against the notion that persecution as a whole was dictated by\r\ninterested motives), was unpurified by rationalism; and he adds that the\r\nirrationality which once characterized the religious sentiment has now\r\nbeen replaced by the irrationality of patriotism. Mr. Lecky says:\r\n\r\n     If we take a broad view of the course of history, and examine\r\n     the relations of great bodies of men, we find that religion\r\n     and patriotism are the chief moral influences to which they\r\n     have been subjected, and that the separate modifications and\r\n     mutual interaction of these two agents may almost be said to\r\n     constitute the moral history of mankind.\r\n\r\nIs it to be expected that the rationalization and humanization which\r\nhave taken place in the more complex domain of religious doctrine and\r\nbelief will not also take place in the domain of patriotism? More\r\nespecially, as the same author points out, since it was the necessities\r\nof material interest which brought about the reform in the first domain,\r\nand since \"not only does interest, as distinct from passion, gain a\r\ngreater empire with advancing civilization, but passion itself is mainly\r\nguided by its power.\"\r\n\r\nHave we not abundant evidence, indeed, that the passion of patriotism,\r\nas divorced from material interest, is being modified by the pressure of\r\nmaterial interest? Are not the numberless facts of national\r\ninterdependence, which I have indicated here, pushing inevitably to that\r\nresult? And are we not justified in concluding that, just as the\r\nprogress of rationalism has made it possible for the various religious\r\ngroups to live together, to exist side by side without physical\r\nconflict; just as there has been in that domain no necessary choice\r\nbetween universal domination or unending strife, so in like manner will\r\nthe progress of political rationalism mark the evolution of the\r\nrelationship of political groups; that the struggle for domination will\r\ncease because it will be realized that physical domination is futile,\r\nand that instead of either universal strife or universal domination\r\nthere will come, without formal treaties or Holy Alliances, the general\r\ndetermination for each to go his way undisturbed in his political\r\nallegiance, as he is now undisturbed in his religious allegiance?\r\n\r\nPerhaps the very strongest evidence that the whole drift of human\r\ntendencies is away from such conflict as is represented by war between\r\nStates is to be found in the writings of those who declare war to be\r\ninevitable. Among the writers quoted in the first chapter of this\r\nsection, there is not one who, if his arguments are examined carefully,\r\ndoes not show that he realizes, consciously, or subconsciously, that\r\nman's disposition to fight, far from being unchanged, is becoming\r\nrapidly enfeebled. Take, for instance, one of the latest works voicing\r\nthe philosophy that war is inevitable; that, indeed, it is both wicked\r\nand childish to try to prevent it.[62] Notwithstanding that the\r\ninevitability of war is the thesis of his book, Homer Lea entitles the\r\nfirst section \"The Decline of Militancy,\" and shows clearly, in fact,\r\nthat the commercial activities of the world lead directly away from war.\r\n\r\n     Trade, ducats, and mortgages are regarded as far greater assets\r\n     and sources of power than armies or navies. They produce\r\n     national effeminacy and effeteness.\r\n\r\nNow, as this tendency is common to all nations of Christendom--indeed,\r\nof the world--since commercial and industrial development is\r\nworld-wide, it necessarily means, if it is true of any one nation, that\r\nthe world as a whole is drifting away from the tendency to warfare.\r\n\r\nA large part of Homer Lea's book is a sort of Carlylean girding at what\r\nhe terms \"protoplasmic gourmandizing and retching\" (otherwise the busy\r\nAmerican industrial and social life of his countrymen). He declares\r\nthat, when a country makes wealth, production, and industries its sole\r\naim, it becomes \"a glutton among nations, vulgar, swinish, arrogant\";\r\n\"commercialism, having seized hold of the American people, overshadows\r\nit, and tends to destroy not only the aspirations and world-wide career\r\nopen to the nation, but the Republic itself.\" \"Patriotism in the true\r\nsense\" (_i.e._, the desire to go and kill other people) Homer Lea\r\ndeclares almost dead in the United States. The national ideals, even of\r\nthe native-born American, are deplorably low:\r\n\r\n     There exists not only individual prejudice against military\r\n     ideals, but public antipathy; antagonism of politicians,\r\n     newspapers, churches, colleges, labor unions, theorists, and\r\n     organized societies. They combat the military spirit as if it\r\n     were a public evil and a national crime.\r\n\r\nIn that case, what, in the name of all that is muddleheaded, becomes of\r\nthe \"unchanging tendency towards warfare\"? What is all this curious\r\nrhetoric of Homer Lea's (and I have dealt with him at some length,\r\nbecause his principles if not his language are those which characterize\r\nmuch similar literature in England, France, Germany, and the continent\r\nof Europe generally) but an admission that the whole tendency is not, as\r\nhe would have us believe, towards war, but away from it? Here is an\r\nauthor who tells us that war is to be forever inevitable, and in the\r\nsame breath that men are rapidly conceiving not only a \"slothful\r\nindifference\" to fighting, but a profound antipathy to the military\r\nideal.\r\n\r\nOf course, Homer Lea implies that this tendency is peculiar to the\r\nAmerican Republic, and is for that reason dangerous to his country; but,\r\nas a matter of fact, Homer Lea's book might be a free translation of\r\nmuch nationalist literature of either France or Germany.[63] I cannot\r\nrecall a single author of either of the four great countries who,\r\ntreating of the inevitability of war, does not bewail the falling away\r\nof his own country from the military ideal, or, at least, the tendency\r\nso to fall away. Thus the English journalist reviewing in the _Daily\r\nMail_ Homer Lea's book cannot refrain from saying:\r\n\r\n     Is it necessary to point out that there is a moral in all this\r\n     for us as well as for the American? Surely almost all that Mr.\r\n     Lea says applies to Great Britain as forcibly as to the United\r\n     States. We too have lain dreaming. We have let our ideals\r\n     tarnish. We have grown gluttonous, also.... Shame and folly are\r\n     upon us as well as upon our brethren. Let us hasten with all\r\n     our energy to cleanse ourselves of them, that we can look the\r\n     future in the face without fear.\r\n\r\nExactly the same note dominates the literature of an English protagonist\r\nlike Mr. Blatchford, the militarist socialist. He talks of the \"fatal\r\napathy\" of the British people. \"The people,\" he says, breaking out in\r\nanger at the small disposition they show to kill other people, \"are\r\nconceited, self-indulgent, decadent, and greedy. They will shout for the\r\nEmpire, but they will not fight for it.\"[64] A glance at such\r\npublications as _Blackwood's_, the _National Review_, the London\r\n_Spectator_, the London _World_, will reveal precisely similar\r\noutbursts.\r\n\r\nOf course, Mr. Blatchford declares that the Germans are very different,\r\nand that what Mr. Lea (in talking of _his_ country) calls the\r\n\"gourmandizing and retching\" is not at all true of Germany. As a matter\r\nof fact, however, the phrase I have quoted might have been \"lifted\" from\r\nthe work of any average Pan-German, or even from more responsible\r\nquarters. Have Mr. Blatchford and Mr. Lea forgotten that no less a\r\nperson than Prince von Buelow, in a speech made in the Prussian Diet,\r\nused almost the words I have quoted from Mr. Blatchford, and dwelt at\r\nlength on the self-indulgence and degeneracy, the rage for luxury, etc.,\r\nwhich possess modern Germany, and told how the old qualities which had\r\nmarked the founders of the Empire were disappearing?[65]\r\n\r\nIndeed, do not a great part of the governing classes of Germany almost\r\ndaily bewail the infiltration of anti-militarist doctrines among the\r\nGerman people, and does not the extraordinary increase in the Socialist\r\nvote justify the complaint?\r\n\r\nA precisely analogous plea is made by the Nationalist writer in France\r\nwhen he rails at the pacifist tendencies of _his_ country, and points to\r\nthe contrasting warlike activities of neighbouring nations. A glance at\r\na copy of practically any Nationalist or Conservative paper in France\r\nwill furnish ample evidence of this. Hardly a day passes but that the\r\n_Echo de Paris_, _Gaulois_, _Figaro_, _Journal des Debats_, _Patrie_, or\r\n_Presse_, sounds this note, while one may find it rampant in the works\r\nof such serious writers as Paul Bourget, Faguet, Le Bon, Barres,\r\nBrunetiere, Paul Adam, to say nothing of more popular publicists like\r\nDeroulede, Millevoye, Drumont, etc.\r\n\r\nAll these advocates of war, therefore--American, English, German,\r\nFrench--are at one in declaring that foreign countries are very warlike,\r\nbut that their own country, \"sunk in sloth,\" is drifting away from war.\r\nAs presumably they know more of their own country than of others, their\r\nown testimony involves mutual destruction of their own theories. They\r\nare thus unwilling witnesses to the truth, which is that we are all\r\nalike--English, Americans, Germans, French--losing the psychological\r\nimpulse to war, just as we have lost the psychological impulse to kill\r\nour neighbors on account of religious differences, and (at least in the\r\ncase of the Anglo-Saxon) to kill our neighbors in duels for some cause\r\nof wounded vanity.\r\n\r\nHow, indeed, could it be otherwise? How can modern life, with its\r\noverpowering proportion of industrial activities and its infinitesimal\r\nproportion of military ones, keep alive the instincts associated with\r\nwar as against those developed by peace?\r\n\r\nNot only evolution, but common sense and common observation, teaches us\r\nthat we develop most those qualities which we exercise most, which serve\r\nus best in the occupation in which we are most engaged. A race of seamen\r\nis not developed by agricultural pursuits, carried on hundreds of miles\r\nfrom the sea.\r\n\r\nTake the case of what is reputed (quite wrongly, incidentally) to be the\r\nmost military nation in Europe--Germany. The immense majority of adult\r\nGermans--practically, all who make up what we know as Germany--have\r\nnever seen a battle, and in all human probability never will see one. In\r\nforty years eight thousand Germans have been in the field about twelve\r\nmonths--against naked blacks.[66] So that the proportion of warlike\r\nactivities to peaceful activities works out at one to hundreds of\r\nthousands. I wish it were possible to illustrate this diagrammatically;\r\nbut it could not be done in this book, because, if a single dot the size\r\nof a full-stop were to be used to illustrate the expenditure of time in\r\nactual war, I should have to fill most of the book with dots to\r\nillustrate the time spent by the balance of the population in peace\r\nactivities.[67]\r\n\r\nIn that case, how can we possibly expect to keep alive warlike\r\nqualities, when all our interests and activities--all our environments,\r\nin short--are peace-like?\r\n\r\nIn other words, the occupations which develop the qualities of industry\r\nand peace are so much in excess of those which would develop the\r\nqualities we associate with war that that excess has almost now passed\r\nbeyond any ordinary means of visual illustration, and has entirely\r\npassed beyond any ordinary human capacity fully to appreciate. Peace is\r\nwith us now nearly always; war is with us rarely, yet we are told that\r\nit is the qualities of war which will survive, and the qualities of\r\npeace which will be subsidiary.\r\n\r\nI am not forgetting, of course, the military training, the barrack life\r\nwhich is to keep alive the military tradition. I have dealt with that\r\nquestion in the next chapter. It suffices for the moment to note that\r\nthat training is defended on the grounds (notably among those who would\r\nintroduce it into England)--(1) that it ensures peace; (2) that it\r\nrenders a population more efficient in the arts of peace--that is to\r\nsay, perpetuates that condition of \"slothful ease\" which we are told is\r\nso dangerous to our characters, in which we are bound to lose the\r\n\"warlike qualities,\" and which renders society still more\r\n\"gourmandizing\" in Mr. Lea's contemptuous phrase, still more \"Cobdenite\"\r\nin Mr. Leo Maxse's. One cannot have it both ways. If long-continued\r\npeace is enervating, it is mere self-stultification to plead for\r\nconscription on the ground that it will still further prolong that\r\nenervating condition. If Mr. Leo Maxse sneers at industrial society and\r\nthe peace ideal--\"the Cobdenite ideal of buying cheap and selling\r\ndear\"--he must not defend German conscription (though he does) on the\r\nground that it renders German commerce more efficient--that, in other\r\nwords, it advances that \"Cobdenite ideal.\" In that case, the drift away\r\nfrom war will be stronger than ever. Perhaps some of all this\r\ninconsistency was in Mr. Roosevelt's mind when he declared that by \"war\r\nalone\" can man develop those manly qualities, etc. If conscription\r\nreally does prolong peace and increase our aptitude for the arts of\r\npeace, then conscription itself is but a factor in man's temperamental\r\ndrift away from war, in the change of his nature towards peace.\r\n\r\nIt is not because man is degenerate or swinish or gluttonous (such\r\nlanguage, indeed, applied as it is by Mr. Lea to the larger and better\r\npart of the human race, suggests a not very high-minded ill-temper at\r\nthe stubbornness of facts which rhetoric does not affect) that he is\r\nshowing less and less disposition to fight, but because he is condemned\r\nby the real \"primordial law\" to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow,\r\nand his nature in consequence develops those qualities which the bulk of\r\nhis interests and capacities demand and favor.\r\n\r\nFinally, of course, we are told that even though these forces are at\r\nwork, they must take \"thousands of years\" to operate. This dogmatism\r\nignores the Law of Acceleration, as true in the domain of sociology as\r\nin that of physics, which I have touched on at the close of the\r\npreceding chapter. The most recent evidence would seem to show that man\r\nas a fire-using animal dates back to the Tertiary epoch--say, three\r\nhundred thousand years. Now, in all that touches this discussion, man in\r\nNorthern Europe (in Great Britain, say) remained unchanged for two\r\nhundred and ninety-eight thousand of those years. In the last two\r\nthousand years he changed more than in the two hundred and ninety-eight\r\nthousand preceding, and in one hundred he has changed more, perhaps,\r\nthan in the preceding two thousand. The comparison becomes more\r\nunderstandable if we resolve it into hours. For, say, fifty years the\r\nman was a cannibal savage or a wild animal, hunting other wild animals,\r\nand then in the space of three months he became John Smith of Des\r\nMoines, attending church, passing laws, using the telephone, and so on.\r\nThat is the history of European mankind. And in the face of it, the\r\nwiseacres talk sapiently, and lay it down as a self-evident and\r\ndemonstrable fact that inter-State war, which, by reason of the\r\nmechanics of our civilization, accomplishes nothing and can accomplish\r\nnothing, will forever be unassailable because, once man has got the\r\nhabit of doing a thing, he will go on doing it, although the\r\nreason which in the first instance prompted it has long since\r\ndisappeared--because, in short, of the \"unchangeability of human\r\nnature.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nDO THE WARLIKE NATIONS INHERIT THE EARTH?\r\n\r\n    The confident dogmatism of militarist writers on this subject--The\r\n    facts--The lessons of Spanish America--How conquest makes for the\r\n    survival of the unfit--Spanish method and English method in the New\r\n    World--The virtues of military training--The Dreyfus case--The\r\n    threatened Germanization of England--\"The war which made Germany\r\n    great and Germans small.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe militarist authorities I have quoted in the preceding chapter admit,\r\ntherefore, and admit very largely, man's drift, in a sentimental sense,\r\naway from war. But that drift, they declare, is degeneration; without\r\nthose qualities which \"war alone,\" in Mr. Roosevelt's phrase, can\r\ndevelop, man will \"rot and decay.\"\r\n\r\nThis plea is, of course, directly germane to our subject. To say that\r\nthe qualities which we associate with war, and nothing else but war, are\r\nnecessary to assure a nation success in its struggles with other nations\r\nis equivalent to saying that those who drift away from war will go down\r\nbefore those whose warlike activity can conserve those qualities\r\nessential to survival; and this is but another way of saying that men\r\nmust always remain warlike if they are to survive, that the warlike\r\nnations inherit the earth; that men's pugnacity, therefore, is the\r\noutcome of the great natural law of survival, and that a decline of\r\npugnacity marks in any nation a retrogression and not an advance in its\r\nstruggle for survival. I have already indicated (Chapter II., Part II.)\r\nthe outlines of the proposition, which leaves no escape from this\r\nconclusion. This is the scientific basis of the proposition voiced by\r\nthe authorities I have quoted--Mr. Roosevelt, Von Moltke, Renan,\r\nNietzsche, and various of the warlike clergy[68]--and it lies at the\r\nvery bottom of the plea that man's nature, in so far as it touches the\r\ntendency of men as a whole to go to war, does not change; that the\r\nwarlike qualities are a necessary part of human vitality in the struggle\r\nfor existence; that, in short, all that we know of the law of evolution\r\nforbids the conclusion that man will ever lose this warlike pugnacity,\r\nor that nations will survive other than by the struggle of physical\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nThe view is best voiced, perhaps, by Homer Lea, whom I have already\r\nquoted. He says, in his \"Valor of Ignorance\":\r\n\r\n     As physical vigor represents the strength of man in his\r\n     struggle for existence, in the same sense military vigor\r\n     constitutes the strength of nations; ideals, laws,\r\n     constitutions are but temporary effulgences [P. 11]. The\r\n     deterioration of the military force and the consequent\r\n     destruction of the militant spirit have been concurrent with\r\n     national decay [P. 24]. International disagreements are ... the\r\n     result of the primordial conditions that sooner or later cause\r\n     war ... the law of struggle, the law of survival, universal,\r\n     unalterable ... to thwart them, to short-cut them, to\r\n     circumvent them, to cozen, to deny, to scorn, to violate them,\r\n     is folly such as man's conceit alone makes possible....\r\n     Arbitration denies the inexorability of natural laws ... that\r\n     govern the existence of political entities [Pp. 76, 77]. Laws\r\n     that govern the militancy of a people are not of man's framing,\r\n     but follow the primitive ordinances of nature that govern all\r\n     forms of life, from simple protozoa, awash in the sea, to the\r\n     empires of man.[69]\r\n\r\nI have already indicated the grave misconception which lies at the\r\nbottom of the interpretation of the evolutionary law here indicated.\r\nWhat we are concerned with now is to deal with the facts on which this\r\nalleged general principle is inductively based. We have seen from the\r\nforegoing chapter that man's nature certainly does change; the next step\r\nis to show, from the facts of the present-day world, that the warlike\r\nqualities do not make for survival, that the warlike nations do not\r\ninherit the earth.\r\n\r\nWhich are the military nations? We generally think of them in Europe as\r\nGermany and France, or perhaps also Russia, Austria, and Italy.\r\nAdmittedly (_vide_ all the English and American military pundits and\r\neconomists) England is the least militarized nation in Europe, the\r\nUnited States perhaps in the world. It is, above all, Germany that\r\nappeals to us as the type of the military nation, one in which the stern\r\nschool of war makes for the preservation of the \"manly and adventurous\r\nqualities.\"\r\n\r\nThe facts want a little closer examination. What is a career of\r\nunwarlike ease, in Mr. Roosevelt's phrase? In the last chapter we saw\r\nthat during the last forty years eight thousand out of sixty million\r\nGermans have been engaged in warfare during a trifle over a year, and\r\nthat against Hottentots or Hereros--a proportion of war days per German\r\nto peace days per German which is as one to some hundreds of thousands.\r\nSo that if we are to take Germany as the type of the military nation,\r\nand if we are to accept Mr. Roosevelt's dictum that by war alone can we\r\nacquire \"those virile qualities necessary to win in the stern strife of\r\nactual life,\" we shall nevertheless be doomed to lose them, for under\r\nconditions like those of Germany how many of us can ever see war, or can\r\npretend to fall under its influence? As already pointed out, the men who\r\nreally give the tone to the German nation, to German life and\r\nconduct--that is to say, the majority of adult Germans--have never seen\r\na battle and never will see one. France has done much better. Not only\r\nhas she seen infinitely more actual fighting, but her population is much\r\nmore militarized than that of Germany, 50 per cent. more, in fact,\r\nsince, in order to maintain from a population of forty millions the same\r\neffective military force as Germany does with sixty millions, 1-1/2 per\r\ncent. of the French population is under arms as against 1 per cent. of\r\nthe German.[70]\r\n\r\nStill more military in organization and in recent practical experience\r\nis Russia, and more military than Russia is Turkey, and more military\r\nthan Turkey as a whole are the semi-independent sections of Turkey,\r\nArabia, and Albania, and then, perhaps, comes Morocco.\r\n\r\nOn the Western Hemisphere we can draw a like table as to the \"warlike,\r\nadventurous, manly, and progressive peoples\" as compared with the\r\n\"peaceful, craven, slothful, and decadent.\" The least warlike of all,\r\nthe nation which has had the least training in war, the least experience\r\nof it, which has been the least purified by it, is Canada. After that\r\ncomes the United States, and after that the best--(excuse me, I mean, of\r\ncourse, the worst--_i.e._, the least warlike)--of the Spanish American\r\nrepublics like Brazil and Argentina; while the most warlike of all, and\r\nconsequently the most \"manly and progressive,\" are the \"Sambo\"\r\nrepublics, like San Domingo, Nicaragua, Colombia, and Venezuela. They\r\nare always fighting. If they cannot manage to get up a fight between one\r\nanother, the various parties in each republic will fight between\r\nthemselves. Here we get the real thing. The soldiers do not pass their\r\nlives in practising the goose-step, cleaning harness, pipeclaying belts,\r\nbut in giving and taking hard pounding. Several of these progressive\r\nrepublics have never known a year since they declared their independence\r\nfrom Spain in which they have not had a war. And quite a considerable\r\nproportion of the populations spend their lives in fighting. During the\r\nfirst twenty years of Venezuela's independent existence she fought no\r\nless than one hundred and twenty important battles, either with her\r\nneighbors or with herself, and she has maintained the average pretty\r\nwell ever since. Every election is a fight--none of your\r\n\"mouth-fighting,\" none of your craven talking-shops for them. Good,\r\nhonest, hard, manly knocks, with anything from one to five thousand\r\ndead and wounded left on the field. The presidents of these strenuous\r\nrepublics are not poltroons of politicians, but soldiers--men of blood\r\nand iron with a vengeance, men after Mr. Roosevelt's own heart, all\r\nfollowing \"the good old rule, the simple plan.\" These are the people who\r\nhave taken Carlyle's advice to \"shut up the talking-shops.\" _They_ fight\r\nit out like men; _they_ talk with Gatling-guns and Mausers. Oh, they are\r\na very fine, manly, military lot! If fighting makes for survival, they\r\nshould completely oust from the field Canada and the United States, one\r\nof which has never had a real battle for the best part of its hundred\r\nyears of craven, sordid, peaceful life, and the other of which Homer Lea\r\nassures us is surely dying, because of its tendency to avoid fighting.\r\n\r\nMr. Lea does not make any secret of the fact (and if he did, some of his\r\nrhetoric would display it) that he is out of sympathy with predominant\r\nAmerican ideals. He might emigrate to Venezuela, or Colombia, or\r\nNicaragua. He would be able to prove to each military dictator in turn\r\nthat, in converting the country into a shambles, far from committing a\r\nfoul crime for which such dictators should be, and are, held in\r\nexecration by civilized men the world over, they are, on the contrary,\r\nbut obeying one of God's commands in tune with all the immutable laws of\r\nthe universe. I desire to write in all seriousness, but, to one who\r\nhappens to have seen at first hand something of the conditions which\r\narise from a real military conception of civilization, it is very\r\ndifficult. How does Mr. Roosevelt, who declares that \"by war alone can\r\nwe acquire those virile qualities necessary to win in the stern strife\r\nof actual life\"; how does Von Stengel, who declares that \"war is a test\r\nof a nation's health, political, physical, and moral\"; how do our\r\nmilitarists, who infer that the military state is so much finer than the\r\nCobdenite one of commercial pursuits; how does M. Ernest Renan, who\r\ndeclares that war is the condition of progress, and that under peace we\r\nshould sink to a degree of degeneracy difficult to realize; and how do\r\nthe various English clergymen who voice a like philosophy reconcile\r\ntheir creed with military Spanish America? How can they urge that\r\nnon-military industrialism, which, with all its shortcomings, has on the\r\nWestern Continent given us Canada and the United States, makes for\r\ndecadence and degeneration, while militarism and the qualities and\r\ninstincts that go with it have given us Venezuela and San Domingo? Do we\r\nnot all recognize that industrialism--Mr. Lea's \"gourmandizing and\r\nretching\" notwithstanding--is the one thing which will save these\r\nmilitary republics; that the one condition of their advance is that they\r\nshall give up the stupid and sordid gold-braid militarism and turn to\r\nhonest work?\r\n\r\nIf ever there was a justification for Herbert Spencer's sweeping\r\ngeneralization that \"advance to the highest forms of man and society\r\ndepends on the decline of militancy and the growth of industrialism,\"\r\nit is to be found in the history of the South and Central American\r\nRepublics. Indeed, Spanish America at the present moment affords more\r\nlessons than we seem to be drawing, and, if militancy makes for advance\r\nand survival, it is a most extraordinary thing that all who are in any\r\nway concerned with those countries, all who live in them and whose\r\nfuture is wrapped up in them, can never sufficiently express their\r\nthankfulness that at last there seems to be a tendency with some of them\r\nto get away from the blood and valor nonsense which has been their curse\r\nfor three centuries, and to exchange the military ideal for the\r\nCobdenite one of buying cheap and selling dear which excites so much\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\nSome years ago an Italian lawyer, a certain Tomasso Caivano, wrote a\r\nletter detailing his experiences and memories of twenty years' life in\r\nVenezuela and the neighboring republics, and his general conclusions\r\nhave for this discussion a direct relevancy. As a sort of farewell\r\nexhortation to the Venezuelans, he wrote:\r\n\r\n     The curse of your civilization is the soldier and the soldier's\r\n     temper. It is impossible for two of you, still less for two\r\n     parties, to carry on a discussion without one wanting to fight\r\n     the other about the matter in hand. You regard it as a\r\n     derogation of dignity to consider the point of view of the\r\n     other side, and to attempt to meet it, if it is possible to\r\n     fight about it. You deem that personal valor atones for all\r\n     defects. The soldier of evil character is more considered\r\n     amongst you than the civilian of good character, and military\r\n     adventure is deemed more honorable than honest labor. You\r\n     overlook the worst corruption, the worst oppression, in your\r\n     leaders if only they gild it with military fanfaronade and\r\n     declamation about bravery and destiny and patriotism. Not until\r\n     there is a change in this spirit will you cease to be the\r\n     victims of evil oppression. Not until your general\r\n     populace--your peasantry and your workers--refuse thus to be\r\n     led to slaughter in quarrels of which they know and care\r\n     nothing, but into which they are led because they also prefer\r\n     fighting to work--not until all this happens will those\r\n     beautiful lands which are among the most fertile on God's earth\r\n     support a happy and prosperous people living in contentment and\r\n     secure possession of the fruits of their labor.[71]\r\n\r\nSpanish America seems at last in a fair way to throwing off the\r\ndomination of the soldier and awakening from these nightmares of\r\nsuccessive military despotisms tempered by assassination, though, in\r\nabandoning, in Signor Caivano's words, \"military adventure for honest\r\nlabor,\" she will necessarily have less to do with those deeds of blood\r\nand valor of which her history has been so full. But those in South\r\nAmerica who matter are not mourning. Really they are not.[72]\r\n\r\nThe situation can be duplicated absolutely on the other side of the\r\nhemisphere. Change a few names, and you get Arabia or Morocco. Listen to\r\nthis from a recent London _Times_ article:[73]\r\n\r\n     The fact is that for many years past Turkey has almost\r\n     invariably been at war in some part or other of Arabia.... At\r\n     the present moment Turkey is actually conducting three separate\r\n     small campaigns within Arabia or upon its borders, and a fourth\r\n     series of minor operations in Mesopotamia. The last-named\r\n     movement is against the Kurdish tribes of the Mosul\r\n     district.... Another, and more important, advance is against\r\n     the truculent Muntefik Arabs of the Euphrates delta.... The\r\n     fourth, and by far the largest, campaign is the unending\r\n     warfare in the province of Yemen, north of Aden, where the\r\n     Turks have been fighting intermittently for more than a decade.\r\n     The peoples of Arabia are also indulging in conflict on their\r\n     own account. The interminable feud between the rival potentates\r\n     of Nedjd, Ibn Saud of Riadh and Ibn Rashid of Hail, has broken\r\n     out afresh, and the tribes of the coastal province of El Katar\r\n     are supposed to have plunged into the fray. The Muntefik Arabs,\r\n     not content with worrying the Turks, are harrying the\r\n     territories of Sheikh Murbarak of Koweit. In the far south the\r\n     Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla, a feudatory of the British\r\n     Government, is conducting a tiny war against a hostile tribe in\r\n     the mysterious Hadramaut. In the west the Beduin are\r\n     spasmodically menacing certain sections of the Hedjaz Railway,\r\n     which they very much dislike.... Ten years ago the Ibn Rashids\r\n     were nominally masters of a great deal of Arabia, and grew so\r\n     aggressive that they tried to seize Koweit. The fiery old\r\n     Sheikh of Koweit marched against them, and alternately won and\r\n     lost. He had his revenge. He sent an audacious scion of the Ibn\r\n     Sauds to the old Wahabi capital of Riadh, and by a remarkable\r\n     stratagem the youth captured the stronghold with only fifty\r\n     men. The rival parties have been fighting at intervals ever\r\n     since.\r\n\r\nAnd so on and so on to the extent of a column. So that what Venezuela\r\nand Nicaragua are to the American Continent, Arabia, Albania, Armenia,\r\nMontenegro, and Morocco are to the Eastern Hemisphere. We find exactly\r\nthe same rule--that just as one gets away from militancy one gets\r\ntowards advance and civilization; as men lose the tendency to fight they\r\ngain the tendency to work, and it is by working with one another, and\r\nnot by fighting against each other, that men advance.\r\n\r\nTake the progression away from militancy, and it gives us a table\r\nsomething like this:\r\n\r\n  Arabia and Morocco.\r\n  Turkish territory as a whole.\r\n  The more unruly Balkan States. Montenegro.\r\n  Russia.\r\n  Spain. Italy. Austria.\r\n  France.\r\n  Germany.\r\n  Scandinavia. Holland. Belgium.\r\n  England.\r\n  The United States.\r\n  Canada.\r\n\r\nDo Mr. Roosevelt, Admiral Mahan, Baron von Stengel, Marshal von Moltke,\r\nMr. Homer Lea, and the English clergymen seriously argue that this list\r\nshould be reversed, and that Arabia and Turkey should be taken as the\r\ntypes of progressive nations, and England and Germany and Scandinavia as\r\nthe decadent?\r\n\r\nIt may be urged that my list is not absolutely accurate, in that\r\nEngland, having fought more little wars (though the conflict with the\r\nBoers, waged with a small, pastoral people, shows how a little war may\r\ndrain a great country), is more militarized than Germany, which has not\r\nbeen fighting at all. But I have tried in a very rough fashion to arrive\r\nat the degree of militancy in each State, and the absence of actual\r\nfighting in the case of Germany (as in that of the smaller States) is\r\nbalanced by the fact of the military training of her people. As I have\r\nindicated, France is more military than Germany, both in the extent to\r\nwhich her people are put through the mill of universal military\r\ntraining, and by virtue of the fact that she has done so much more small\r\nfighting than Germany (Madagascar, Tonkin, Africa, etc.); while, of\r\ncourse, Turkey and the Balkan States are still more military in both\r\nsenses--more actual fighting, more military training.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the militarist will argue that, while useless and unjust wars\r\nmake for degeneration, just wars are a moral regeneration. But did a\r\nnation, group, tribe, family, or individual ever yet enter into a war\r\nwhich he did not think just? The British, or most of them, believed the\r\nwar against the Boers just, but most of the authorities in favor of war\r\nin general, outside of Great Britain, believed it unjust. Nowhere do you\r\nfind such deathless, absolute, unwavering belief in the justice of war\r\nas in those conflicts which all Christendom knows to be at once unjust\r\nand unnecessary. I refer to the religious wars of Mohammedan fanaticism.\r\n\r\nDo you suppose that when Nicaragua goes to war with San Salvador, or\r\nCosta Rica or Colombia with Peru, or Peru with Chili, or Chili with\r\nArgentina, they do not each and every one of them believe that they are\r\nfighting for immutable and deathless principles? The civilization of\r\nmost of them is, of course, as like as two peas, and there is no more\r\nreason, except their dislike of rational thought and hard work, why they\r\nshould fight with one another, than that Illinois should fight with\r\nIndiana, despite Homer Lea's fine words as to the primordial character\r\nof national differences; to one another they are as alike, and whether\r\nSan Salvador beats Costa Rica or Costa Rica, San Salvador, does not, so\r\nfar as essentials are concerned, matter a continental. But their\r\nrhetoric of patriotism--the sacrifice, and the deathless glory, and the\r\nrest of it--is often just as sincere as ours. That is the tragedy of it,\r\nand it is that which gives to the solution of the problem in Spanish\r\nAmerica its real difficulty.\r\n\r\nBut even if we admit that warfare _a l'espagnole_ may be degrading, and\r\nthat just wars are ennobling and necessary to our moral welfare, we\r\nshould nevertheless be condemned to degeneracy and decline. A just war\r\nimplies that someone must act unjustly towards us, but as the general\r\ncondition improves--as it is improving in Europe as compared with\r\nCentral and South America, or Morocco, or Arabia--we shall get less and\r\nless \"moral purification\"; as men become less and less disposed to make\r\nunjustifiable attacks, they will become more and more degenerate. In\r\nsuch incoherence are we landed by the pessimistic and impossible\r\nphilosophy that men will decay and die unless they go on killing each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nWhat is the fundamental error at the base of the theory that war makes\r\nfor the survival of the fit--that warfare is any necessary expression of\r\nthe law of survival? It is the illusion induced by the hypnotism of a\r\nterminology which is obsolete. The same factor which leads us so astray\r\nin the economic domain leads us astray in this also.\r\n\r\nConquest does not make for the elimination of the conquered; the weakest\r\ndo not go to the wall, though that is the process which those who adopt\r\nthe formula of evolution in this matter have in their minds.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain has conquered India. Does that mean that the inferior race\r\nis replaced by the superior? Not the least in the world; the inferior\r\nrace not only survives, but is given an extra lease of life by virtue\r\nof the conquest. If ever the Asiatic threatens the white race, it will\r\nbe thanks in no small part to the work of race conservation which\r\nEngland's conquests in the East have involved. War, therefore, does not\r\nmake for the elimination of the unfit and the survival of the fit. It\r\nwould be truer to say that it makes for the survival of the unfit.\r\n\r\nWhat is the real process of war? You carefully select from the general\r\npopulation on both sides the healthiest, sturdiest, the physically and\r\nmentally soundest, those possessing precisely the virile and manly\r\nqualities which you desire to preserve, and, having thus selected the\r\nelite of the two populations, you exterminate them by battle and\r\ndisease, and leave the worst of both sides to amalgamate in the process\r\nof conquest or defeat--because, in so far as the final amalgamation is\r\nconcerned, both processes have the same result--and from this amalgam of\r\nthe worst of both sides you create the new nation or the new society\r\nwhich is to carry on the race. Even supposing the better nation wins,\r\nthe fact of conquest results only in the absorption of the inferior\r\nqualities of the beaten nation--inferior presumably because beaten, and\r\ninferior because we have killed off their selected best and absorbed the\r\nrest, since we no longer exterminate the women, the children, the old\r\nmen, and those too weak or too feeble to go into the army.[74]\r\n\r\nYou have only to carry on this process long enough and persistently\r\nenough to weed out completely from both sides the type of man to whom\r\nalone we can look for the conservation of virility, physical vigor, and\r\nhardihood. That such a process did play no small role in the\r\ndegeneration of Rome and the populations on which the crux of the Empire\r\nreposed there can hardly be any reasonable doubt. And the process of\r\ndegeneration on the part of the conqueror is aided by this additional\r\nfactor: If the conqueror profits much by his conquest, as the Romans in\r\none sense did, it is the conqueror who is threatened by the enervating\r\neffect of the soft and luxurious life; while it is the conquered who is\r\nforced to labor for the conqueror, and learns in consequence those\r\nqualities of steady industry which are certainly a better moral training\r\nthan living upon the fruits of others, upon labor extorted at the\r\nsword's point. It is the conqueror who becomes effete, and it is the\r\nconquered who learns discipline and the qualities making for a\r\nwell-ordered State.\r\n\r\nTo say of war, therefore, as does Baron von Stengel, that it destroys\r\nthe frail trees, leaving the sturdy oaks standing, is merely to state\r\nwith absolute confidence the exact reverse of the truth; to take\r\nadvantage of loose catch-phrases, which by inattention not only distort\r\ncommon thought in these matters, but often turn the truth upside down.\r\nOur everyday ideas are full of illustrations of the same thing. For\r\nhundreds of years we talked of the \"riper wisdom of the ancients,\"\r\nimplying that this generation is the youth in experience, and that the\r\nearly ages had the accumulated experience--the exact reverse, of course,\r\nof the truth. Yet \"the learning of the ancients\" and \"the wisdom of our\r\nforefathers\" was a common catch-phrase, even in the British Parliament,\r\nuntil an English country parson killed this nonsense by ridicule.[75]\r\n\r\nI do not urge that the somewhat simple, elementary, selective process\r\nwhich I have described accounts in itself for the decadence of military\r\nPowers. That is only a part of the process; the whole of it is somewhat\r\nmore complicated, in that the process of elimination of the good in\r\nfavor of the bad is quite as much sociological as biological; that is to\r\nsay, if during long periods a nation gives itself up to war, trade\r\nlanguishes, the population loses the habit of steady industry,\r\ngovernment and administration become corrupt, abuses escape punishment,\r\nand the real sources of a people's strength and expansion dwindle. What\r\nhas caused the relative failure and decline of Spanish, Portuguese, and\r\nFrench expansion in Asia and the New World, and the relative success of\r\nEnglish expansion therein? Was it the mere hazards of war which gave to\r\nGreat Britain the domination of India and half of the New World? That is\r\nsurely a superficial reading of history. It was, rather, that the\r\nmethods and processes of Spain, Portugal, and France were military,\r\nwhile those of the Anglo-Saxon world were commercial and peaceful. Is it\r\nnot a commonplace that in India, quite as much as in the New World, the\r\ntrader and the settler drove out the soldier and the conqueror? The\r\ndifference between the two methods was that one was a process of\r\nconquest, and the other of colonizing, or non-military administration\r\nfor commercial purposes. The one embodied the sordid Cobdenite idea,\r\nwhich so excites the scorn of the militarists, and the other the lofty\r\nmilitary ideal. The one was parasitism; the other co-operation.[76]\r\n\r\nThose who confound the power of a nation with the size of its army and\r\nnavy are mistaking the check-book for the money. A child, seeing its\r\nfather paying bills in checks, assumes that you need only plenty of\r\ncheck-books in order to have plenty of money; it does not see that for\r\nthe check-book to have power there must be unseen resources on which to\r\ndraw. Of what use is domination unless there be individual capacity,\r\nsocial training, industrial resources, to profit thereby? How can you\r\nhave these things if energy is wasted in military adventure? Is not the\r\nfailure of Spain explicable by the fact that she failed to realize this\r\ntruth? For three centuries she attempted to live upon conquest, upon the\r\nforce of her arms, and year after year got poorer in the process and her\r\nmodern social renaissance dates from the time when she lost the last of\r\nher American colonies. It is since the loss of Cuba and the Philippines\r\nthat Spanish national securities have doubled in value. (At the outbreak\r\nof the Hispano-American War Spanish Fours were at 45; they have since\r\ntouched par.) If Spain has shown in the last decade a social\r\nrenaissance, not shown perhaps for a hundred and fifty years, it is\r\nbecause a nation still less military than Germany, and still more purely\r\nindustrial, has compelled Spain once and for all to surrender all dreams\r\nof empire and conquest. The circumstances of the last surrender are\r\neloquent in this connection as showing how even in warfare itself the\r\nindustrial training and the industrial tradition--the Cobdenite ideal of\r\nmilitarist scorn--are more than a match for the training of a society in\r\nwhich military activities are predominant. If it be true that it was the\r\nGerman schoolmaster who conquered at Sedan, it was the Chicago merchant\r\nwho conquered at Manila. The writer happens to have been in touch both\r\nwith Spaniards and Americans at the time of the war, and well remembers\r\nthe scorn with which the Spaniards referred to the notion that the\r\nYankee pork-butchers could possibly conquer a nation of their military\r\ntradition, and to the idea that tradesmen would ever be a match for the\r\nsoldiery and pride of old Spain. And French opinion was not so very\r\ndifferent.[77] Shortly after the war I wrote in an American journal as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     Spain represents the outcome of some centuries devoted mainly\r\n     to military activity. No one can say that she has been\r\n     unmilitary or at all deficient in those qualities which we\r\n     associate with soldiers and soldiering. Yet, if such qualities\r\n     in any way make for national efficiency, for the conservation\r\n     of national force, the history of Spain is absolutely\r\n     inexplicable. In their late contest with America, Spaniards\r\n     showed no lack of the distinctive military virtues. Spain's\r\n     inferiority--apart from deficiency of men and money--was\r\n     precisely in those qualities which industrialism has bred in\r\n     the unmilitary American. Authentic stories of wretched\r\n     equipment, inadequate supplies, and bad leadership show to what\r\n     depths of inefficiency the Spanish service, military and naval,\r\n     had fallen. We are justified in believing that a much smaller\r\n     nation than Spain, but one possessing a more industrial and\r\n     less military training, would have done much better, both as\r\n     regards resistance to America and the defence of her own\r\n     colonies. The present position of Holland in Asia seems to\r\n     prove this. The Dutch, whose traditions are industrial and\r\n     non-military for the most part, have shown greater power and\r\n     efficiency as a nation than the Spanish, who are more numerous.\r\n\r\n     Here, as always, it is shown that, in considering national\r\n     efficiency, even as expressed in military power, the economic\r\n     problem cannot be divorced from the military, and that it is a\r\n     fatal mistake to suppose that the power of a nation depends\r\n     solely upon the power of its public bodies, or that it can be\r\n     judged simply from the size of its army. A large army may,\r\n     indeed, be a sign of a national--that is, military--weakness.\r\n     Warfare in these days is a business like other activities, and\r\n     no courage, no heroism, no \"glorious past,\" no \"immortal\r\n     traditions,\" will atone for deficient rations and fraudulent\r\n     administration. Good civilian qualities are the ones that will\r\n     in the end win a nation's battles. The Spaniard is the last one\r\n     in the world to see this. He talks and dreams of Castilian\r\n     bravery and Spanish honor, and is above shopkeeping details....\r\n     A writer on contemporary Spain remarks that any intelligent\r\n     middle-class Spaniard will admit every charge of incompetence\r\n     which can be brought against the conduct of public affairs.\r\n     \"Yes, we have a wretched Government. In any other country\r\n     somebody would be shot.\" This is the hopeless military creed:\r\n     killing somebody is the only remedy.\r\n\r\nHere we see a trace of that intellectual legacy which Spain has left to\r\nthe New World, and which has stamped itself so indelibly on the history\r\nof Spanish America. On a later occasion in this connection I wrote as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     To appreciate the outcome of much soldiering, the condition in\r\n     which persistent military training may leave a race, one should\r\n     study Spanish America. Here we have a collection of some score\r\n     of States, all very much alike in social and political make-up.\r\n     Most of the South American States so resemble one another in\r\n     language, laws, institutions, that to an outsider it would seem\r\n     not to matter a straw under which particular six-months-old\r\n     republic one should live; whether one be under the Government\r\n     of the pronunciamento-created President of Colombia, or under\r\n     that of the President of Venezuela, one's condition would\r\n     appear to be much the same. Apparently no particular country\r\n     has anything which differentiates it from another, and,\r\n     consequently, anything to protect against the other. Actually,\r\n     the Governments might all change places and the people be none\r\n     the wiser. Yet, so hypnotized, are these little States by the\r\n     \"necessity for self-protection,\" by the glamour of armaments,\r\n     that there is not one without a relatively elaborate and\r\n     expensive military establishment to protect it from the rest.\r\n\r\n     No conditions seem so propitious for a practical confederation\r\n     as those of Spanish America; with a few exceptions, the virtual\r\n     unity of language, laws, general race-ideals, would seem to\r\n     render protection of frontiers supererogatory. Yet the citizens\r\n     give untold wealth, service, life, and suffering to be\r\n     protected against a Government exactly like their own. All this\r\n     waste of life and energy has gone on without it ever occurring\r\n     to one of these States that it would be preferable to be\r\n     annexed a thousand times over, so trifling would be the\r\n     resulting change in their condition, than continue the\r\n     everlasting and futile tribute of blood and treasure. Over some\r\n     absolutely unimportant matter--like that of the Patagonian\r\n     roads, which nearly brought Argentina and Chili to grips the\r\n     other day--as much patriotic devotion will be expended as ever\r\n     the Old Guard lavished in protecting the honor of the Tricolor.\r\n     Battles will be fought which will make all the struggles in\r\n     South Africa appear mean in comparison. Actions in which the\r\n     dead are counted in thousands will excite no more comment in\r\n     the world than that produced by a skirmish in Natal, in which a\r\n     score of yeomen are captured and released.[78]\r\n\r\nIn the decade since the foregoing was written things have enormously\r\nimproved in South America. Why? For the simple reason, as pointed out in\r\nChapter V. of the first part of this book, that Spanish America is being\r\nbrought more and more into the economic movement of the world; and with\r\nthe establishment of factories, in which large capital has been sunk,\r\nbanks, businesses, etc., the whole attitude of mind of those interested\r\nin these ventures is changed. The Jingo, the military adventurer, the\r\nfomentor of trouble, are seen for what they are--not as patriots, but as\r\nrepresenting exceedingly mischievous and maleficent forces.\r\n\r\nThis general truth has two facets: if long warfare diverts a people from\r\nthe capacity for industry, so in the long run economic pressure--the\r\ninfluences, that is, which turn the energies of people to preoccupation\r\nwith social well-being--is fatal to the military tradition. Neither\r\ntendency is constant; warfare produces poverty; poverty pushes to thrift\r\nand work, which result in wealth; wealth creates leisure and pride and\r\npushes to warfare.\r\n\r\nWhere Nature does not respond readily to industrial effort, where it is,\r\nat least apparently, more profitable to plunder than to work, the\r\nmilitary tradition survives. The Beduin has been a bandit since the time\r\nof Abraham, for the simple reason that the desert does not support\r\nindustrial life nor respond to industrial effort. The only career\r\noffering a fair apparent return for effort is plunder. In Morocco, in\r\nArabia, in all very poor pastoral countries, the same phenomenon is\r\nexhibited; in mountainous countries which are arid and are removed from\r\nthe economic centres, _idem_. The same may have been to some extent the\r\ncase in Prussia before the era of coal and iron; but the fact that\r\nto-day 99 per cent. of the population is normally engaged in trade and\r\nindustry, and 1 per cent. only in military preparation, and some\r\nfraction too small to be properly estimated engaged in actual war, shows\r\nhow far she has outgrown such a state--shows, incidentally, what little\r\nchance the ideal and tradition represented by 1 per cent. or some\r\nfractional percentage has against interests and activities represented\r\nby 99 per cent. The recent history of South and Central America, because\r\nit is recent, and because the factors are less complicated, illustrates\r\nbest the tendency with which we are dealing. Spanish America inherited\r\nthe military tradition in all its vigor. As I have already pointed out,\r\nthe Spanish occupation of the American Continent was a process of\r\nconquest rather than of colonizing; and while the mother country got\r\npoorer and poorer by the process of conquest, the new countries also\r\nimpoverished themselves in adherence to the same fatal illusion. The\r\nglamour of conquest was, of course, Spain's ruin. So long as it was\r\npossible for her to live on extorted bullion, neither social nor\r\nindustrial development seemed possible. Despite the common idea to the\r\ncontrary, Germany has known how to keep this fatal hypnotism at bay,\r\nand, far from allowing her military activities to absorb her industrial,\r\nit is precisely the military activities which are in a fair way now to\r\nbeing absorbed by the industrial and commercial, and her world commerce\r\nhas its foundation, not in tribute or bullion exacted at the sword's\r\npoint, but in sound and honest exchange. So that to-day the legitimate\r\ncommercial tribute which Germany, who never sent a soldier there, exacts\r\nfrom Spanish America is immensely greater than that which goes to Spain,\r\nwho poured out blood and treasure during three centuries on these\r\nterritories. In this way, again, do the warlike nations inherit the\r\nearth!\r\n\r\nIf Germany is never to duplicate Spain's decadence, it is precisely\r\nbecause (1) she has never had, historically, Spain's temptation to live\r\nby conquest, and (2) because, having to live by honest industry, her\r\ncommercial hold, even upon the territories conquered by Spain, is more\r\nfirmly set than that of Spain herself.\r\n\r\nHow may we sum up the whole case, keeping in mind every empire that ever\r\nexisted--the Assyrian, the Babylonian, the Mede and Persian, the\r\nMacedonian, the Roman, the Frank, the Saxon, the Spanish, the\r\nPortuguese, the Bourbon, the Napoleonic? In all and every one of them\r\nwe may see the same process, which is this: If it remains military it\r\ndecays; if it prospers and takes its share of the work of the world it\r\nceases to be military. There is no other reading of history.\r\n\r\nThat history furnishes no justification for the plea that pugnacity and\r\nantagonism between nations is bound up in any way with the real process\r\nof national survival, shows clearly enough that nations nurtured\r\nnormally in peace are more than a match for nations nurtured normally in\r\nwar; that communities of non-military tradition and instincts, like the\r\nAnglo-Saxon communities of the New World, show elements of survival\r\nstronger than those possessed by communities animated by the military\r\ntradition, like the Spanish and Portuguese nations of the New World;\r\nthat the position of the industrial nations in Europe as compared with\r\nthe military gives no justification for the plea that the warlike\r\nqualities make for survival. It is clearly evident that there is no\r\nbiological justification in the terms of man's political evolution for\r\nthe perpetuation of antagonism between nations, nor any justification\r\nfor the plea that the diminution of such antagonism runs counter to the\r\nteachings of the \"natural law.\" There is no such natural law; in\r\naccordance with natural laws, men are being thrust irresistibly towards\r\nco-operation between communities and not towards conflict.\r\n\r\nThere remains the argument that, though the conflict itself may make for\r\ndegeneration, the preparation for that conflict makes for survival, for\r\nthe improvement of human nature. I have already touched upon the\r\nhopeless confusion which comes of the plea that, while long-continued\r\npeace is bad, military preparations find justification in that they\r\ninsure peace.\r\n\r\nAlmost every defence of militarism includes a sneer at the ideal of\r\npeace because it involves the Cobdenite state of buying cheap and\r\nselling dear. But, with equal regularity, the advocate of the military\r\nsystem goes on to argue for great armaments, not as a means of promoting\r\nwar, that valuable school, etc., but as the best means of securing\r\npeace; in other words, that condition of \"buying cheap and selling dear\"\r\nwhich but a moment before he has condemned as so defective. As though to\r\nmake the stultification complete, he pleads for the peace value of\r\nmilitary training, on the ground that German commerce has benefited from\r\nit--that, in other words, it has promoted the \"Cobdenite ideal.\" The\r\nanalysis of the reasoning, as has been brilliantly shown by Mr. John M.\r\nRobertson,[79] gives a result something like this: (1) War is a great\r\nschool of morals, therefore we must have great armaments to insure\r\npeace; (2) to secure peace engenders the Cobdenite ideal, which is bad,\r\ntherefore we should adopt conscription, (_a_) because it is the best\r\nsafeguard of peace, (_b_) because it is a training for commerce--the\r\nCobdenite ideal.\r\n\r\nIs it true that barrack training--the sort of school which the\r\ncompetition of armaments during the last generation has imposed on the\r\npeople of Continental Europe--makes for moral health? Is it likely that\r\na \"perpetual rehearsal for something never likely to come off, and when\r\nit comes off is not like the rehearsal,\" should be a training for life's\r\nrealities? Is it likely that such a process would have the stamp and\r\ntouch of closeness to real things? Is it likely that the mechanical\r\nroutine of artificial occupations, artificial crimes, artificial\r\nvirtues, artificial punishments should form any training for the battle\r\nof real life?[80] What of the Dreyfus case? What of the abominable\r\nscandals that have marked German military life of late years? If peace\r\nmilitary training is such a fine school, how could the London _Times_\r\nwrite thus of France after she had submitted to a generation of a very\r\nsevere form of it:\r\n\r\n     A thrill of horror and shame ran through the whole civilized\r\n     world outside France when the result of the Rennes\r\n     Court-Martial became known.... By their (the officers') own\r\n     admission, whether flung defiantly at the judges, their\r\n     inferiors, or wrung from them under cross-examination,\r\n     Dreyfus's chief accusers were convicted of gross and\r\n     fraudulent illegalities which, anywhere, would have sufficed,\r\n     not only to discredit their testimony--had they any serious\r\n     testimony to offer--but to transfer them speedily from the\r\n     witness-box to the prisoner's dock.... Their vaunted honor\r\n     \"rooted in dishonor stood.\" ... Five judges out of the seven\r\n     have once more demonstrated the truth of the astounding axiom\r\n     first propounded during the Zola trial, that \"military justice\r\n     is not as other justice.\" ... We have no hesitation in saying\r\n     that the Rennes Court-Martial constitutes in itself the\r\n     grossest, and, viewed in the light of the surrounding\r\n     circumstances, the most appalling prostitution of justice which\r\n     the world has witnessed in modern times.... Flagrantly,\r\n     deliberately, mercilessly trampled justice underfoot.... The\r\n     verdict, which is a slap in the face to the public opinion of\r\n     the civilized world, to the conscience of humanity.... France\r\n     is henceforth on her trial before history. Arraigned at the bar\r\n     of a tribunal far higher than that before which Dreyfus stood,\r\n     it rests with her to show whether she will undo this great\r\n     wrong and rehabilitate her fair name, or whether she will stand\r\n     irrevocably condemned and disgraced by allowing it to be\r\n     consummated. We can less than ever afford to underrate the\r\n     forces against truth and justice.... Hypnotized by the wild\r\n     tales perpetually dinned into all credulous ears of an\r\n     international \"syndicate of treason,\" conspiring against the\r\n     honor of the army and the safety of France, the conscience of\r\n     the French nation has been numbed, and its intelligence\r\n     atrophied.... Amongst those statesmen who are in touch with the\r\n     outside world in the Senate and Chamber there must be some that\r\n     will remind her that nations, no more than individuals, cannot\r\n     bear the burden of universal scorn and live.... France cannot\r\n     close her ears to the voice of the civilized world, for that\r\n     voice is the voice of history.[81]\r\n\r\nAnd what the _Times_ said then all England was saying, and not only all\r\nEngland, but all America.\r\n\r\nAnd has Germany escaped a like condemnation? We commonly assume that the\r\nDreyfus case could not be duplicated in Germany. But this is not the\r\nopinion of very many Germans themselves. Indeed, just before the Dreyfus\r\ncase reached its crisis, the Kotze scandal--in its way just as grave as\r\nthe Dreyfus affair, and revealing a moral condition just as\r\nserious--prompted the London _Times_ to declare that \"certain features\r\nof German civilization are such as to make it difficult for Englishmen\r\nto understand how the whole State does not collapse from sheer\r\nrottenness.\" If that could be said of the Kotze affair, what shall be\r\nsaid of the state of things which has been revealed by Maximilien Harden\r\namong others?\r\n\r\nNeed it be said that the writer of these lines does not desire to\r\nrepresent Germans as a whole as more corrupt than their neighbors? But\r\nimpartial observers are not of opinion, and very many Germans are not of\r\nopinion, that there has been either economic, social, or moral advantage\r\nto the German people from the victories of 1870 and the state of\r\nregimentation which the sequel has imposed. This is surely evidenced by\r\nthe actual position of affairs in the German Empire, the complex\r\ndifficulty with which the German people are now struggling, the growing\r\ndiscontent, the growing influence of those elements which are nurtured\r\nin discontent, the growth on one side of radical intransigence and on\r\nthe other of almost feudal autocracy, the failure to effect normally and\r\neasily those democratic developments which have been effected in almost\r\nevery other European State, the danger for the future which such a\r\nsituation represents, the precariousness of German finance, the\r\nrelatively small profit which her population as a whole has received\r\nfrom the greatly increased foreign trade--all this, and much more,\r\nconfirms that view. England has of late seemed to have been affected\r\nwith the German superstition. With the curious perversity that marks\r\n\"patriotic\" judgments, the whole tendency of the English has been to\r\nmake comparisons with Germany to the disadvantage of themselves and of\r\nother European countries. Yet if Germans themselves are to be believed,\r\nmuch of that superiority which the English see in Germany is as purely\r\nnon-existent as the phantom German war-balloon to which the British\r\nPress devoted serious columns, to the phantom army corps in Epping\r\nForest, to the phantom stories of arms in London cellars, and to the\r\nGerman spy which English patriots see in every Italian waiter.[82]\r\n\r\nDespite the hypnotism which German \"progress\" seems to exercise on the\r\nminds of English Jingoes, the German people themselves, as distinct\r\nfrom the small group of Prussian Junkers, are not in the least enamored\r\nof it, as is proved by the unparalleled growth of the social-democratic\r\nelement, which is the negation of military imperialism, and which, as\r\nthe figures in Prussia prove, receives support not from one class of the\r\npopulation merely, but from the mercantile, industrial, and professional\r\nclasses as well. The agitation for electoral reform in Prussia shows how\r\nacute the conflict has become; on the one side the increasing democratic\r\nelement showing more and more of a revolutionary tendency, and on the\r\nother side the Prussian autocracy showing less and less disposition to\r\nyield. Does anyone really believe that the situation will remain there,\r\nthat the Democratic parties will continue to grow in numbers and be\r\ncontent for ever to be ridden down by the \"booted Prussian,\" and that\r\nGerman democracy will indefinitely accept a situation in which it will\r\nbe always possible--in the words of the Junker, von Oldenburg, member of\r\nthe Reichstag--for the German Emperor to say to a Lieutenant, \"Take ten\r\nmen and close the Reichstag\"?\r\n\r\nWhat must be the German's appreciation of the value of military victory\r\nand militarization when, mainly because of it, he finds himself engaged\r\nin a struggle which elsewhere less militarized nations settled a\r\ngeneration since? And what has the English defender of the militarist\r\nregimen, who holds the German system up for imitation, to say of it as a\r\nschool of national discipline, when the Imperial Chancellor himself\r\ndefends the refusal of democratic suffrage like that obtaining in\r\nEngland on the ground that the Prussian people have not yet acquired\r\nthose qualities of public discipline which make it workable in\r\nEngland?[83]\r\n\r\nYet what Prussia, in the opinion of the Chancellor, is not yet fit for,\r\nScandinavian nations, Switzerland, Holland, Belgium, have fitted\r\nthemselves for without the aid of military victory and subsequent\r\nregimentation. Did not someone once say that the war had made Germany\r\ngreat and Germans small?\r\n\r\nWhen we ascribe so large a measure of Germany's social progress (which\r\nno one, so far as I know, is concerned to deny) to the victories and\r\nregimentation, why do we conveniently overlook the social progress of\r\nthe small States which I have just mentioned, where such progress on the\r\nmaterial side has certainly been as great as, and on the moral side\r\ngreater than, in Germany? Why do we overlook the fact that, if Germany\r\nhas done well in certain social organizations, Scandinavia and\r\nSwitzerland have done better? And why do we overlook the fact that, if\r\nregimentation is of such social value, it has been so completely\r\ninoperative in States which are more highly militarized even than\r\nGermany--in Spain, Italy, Austria, Turkey, and Russia?\r\n\r\nBut even assuming--a very large assumption--that regimentation has\r\nplayed the role in German progress which English Germano-maniacs would\r\nhave us believe, is there any justification for supposing that a like\r\nprocess would be in any way adaptable to English conditions social,\r\nmoral, material, and historical?\r\n\r\nThe position of Germany since the war of 1870--what it has stood for in\r\nthe generation since victory, and what it stood for in the generations\r\nthat followed defeat--furnishes a much-needed lesson as to the outcome\r\nof the philosophy of force. Practically all impartial observers of\r\nGermany are in agreement with Mr. Harbutt Dawson when he writes as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     It is questionable whether unified Germany counts as much\r\n     to-day as an intellectual and moral agent in the world as when\r\n     it was little better than a geographical expression.... Germany\r\n     has at command an apparently inexhaustible reserve of physical\r\n     and material force, but the real influence and power which it\r\n     exerts is disproportionately small. The history of civilization\r\n     is full of proofs that the two things are not synonymous. A\r\n     nation's mere force is, on ultimate analysis, its sum of brute\r\n     strength. This force may, indeed, go with intrinsic power, yet\r\n     such power can never depend permanently on force, and the test\r\n     is easy to apply.... No one who genuinely admires the best in\r\n     the German character, and who wishes well to the German people,\r\n     will seek to minimize the extent of the loss which would appear\r\n     to have befallen the old national ideals; hence the discontent\r\n     of the enlightened classes with the political laws under which\r\n     they live--a discontent often vague and indefinite, the\r\n     discontent of men who do not know clearly what is wrong or what\r\n     they want, but feel that a free play is denied them which\r\n     belongs to the dignity and worth and essence of human\r\n     personality.\r\n\r\n\"Is there a German culture to-day?\" asks Fuchs.[84] \"We Germans are able\r\nto perfect all works of civilizing power as well as, and indeed better\r\nthan, the best in other nations. Yet nothing that the heroes of labor\r\nexecute goes beyond our own border.\" And the most extraordinary thing is\r\nthat those who do not in the least deny this condition to which Germany\r\nhas fallen--who, indeed, exaggerate it, and ask us with triumph to look\r\nupon the brutality of German method and German conception--ask us to go\r\nand follow Germany's example!\r\n\r\nMost British pro-armament agitation is based upon the plea that Germany\r\nis dominated by a philosophy of force. They point to books like those of\r\nGeneral Bernhardi, idealizing the employment of force, and then urge a\r\npolicy of replying by force--and force only--which would, of course,\r\njustify in Germany the Bernhardi school, and by the reaction of opposing\r\nforces stereotype the philosophy in Europe and make it part of the\r\ngeneral European tradition. England stands in danger of becoming\r\nPrussianized by virtue of the fact of fighting Prussianism, or rather by\r\nvirtue of the fact that, instead of fighting it with the intellectual\r\ntools that won religious freedom in Europe, she insists upon confining\r\nher efforts to the tools of physical force.\r\n\r\nSome of the acutest foreign students of English progress--men like\r\nEdmond Demolins--ascribe it to the very range of qualities which the\r\nGerman system is bound to crush; their aptitude for initiative, their\r\nreliance upon their own efforts, their sturdy resistance to State\r\ninterference (already weakening), their impatience with bureaucracy and\r\nred tape (also weakening), all of which is wrapped up with general\r\nrebelliousness to regimentation.\r\n\r\nThough the English base part of the defence of armaments on the plea\r\nthat, economic interest apart, they desire to live their own life in\r\ntheir own way, to develop in their own fashion, do they not run some\r\ndanger that with this mania for the imitation of German method they may\r\nGermanize England, though never a German soldier land on their soil?\r\n\r\nOf course, it is always assumed that, though the English may adopt the\r\nFrench and German system of conscription, they could never fall a victim\r\nto the defects of those systems, and that the scandals which break out\r\nfrom time to time in France and Germany could never be duplicated by\r\n_their_ barrack system, and that the military atmosphere of their own\r\nbarracks, the training in their own army, would always be wholesome.\r\nBut what do even its defenders say?\r\n\r\nMr. Blatchford himself says:[85]\r\n\r\n     Barrack life is bad. Barrack life will always be bad. It is\r\n     never good for a lot of men to live together apart from home\r\n     influences and feminine. It is not good for women to live or\r\n     work in communities of women. The sexes react upon each other;\r\n     each provides for the other a natural restraint, a wholesome\r\n     incentive.... The barracks and the garrison town are not good\r\n     for young men. The young soldier, fenced and hemmed in by a\r\n     discipline unnecessarily severe, and often stupid, has at the\r\n     same time an amount of license which is dangerous to all but\r\n     those of strong good sense and strong will. I have seen clean,\r\n     good, nice boys come into the Army and go to the devil in less\r\n     than a year. I am no Puritan. I am a man of the world; but any\r\n     sensible and honest man who has been in the Army will know at\r\n     once that what I am saying is entirely true, and is the truth\r\n     expressed with much restraint and moderation. A few hours in a\r\n     barrack-room would teach a civilian more than all the soldier\r\n     stories ever written. When I joined the Army I was unusually\r\n     unsophisticated for a boy of twenty. I had been brought up by a\r\n     mother. I had attended Sunday-school and chapel. I had lived a\r\n     quiet, sheltered life, and I had an astonishing amount to\r\n     learn. The language of the barrack-room shocked me, appalled\r\n     me. I could not understand half I heard; I could not credit\r\n     much that I saw. When I began to realize the truth, I took my\r\n     courage in both hands and went about the world I had come into\r\n     with open eyes. So I learnt the facts, but I must not tell\r\n     them.[86]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE DIMINISHING FACTOR OF PHYSICAL FORCE: PSYCHOLOGICAL RESULTS\r\n\r\n    Diminishing factor of physical force--Though diminishing, physical\r\n    force has always had an important role in human affairs--What is\r\n    underlying principle, determining advantageous and disadvantageous\r\n    use of physical force?--Force that aids co-operation in accord\r\n    with law of man's advance: force that is exercised for\r\n    parasitism in conflict with such law and disadvantageous for\r\n    both parties--Historical process of the abandonment of physical\r\n    force--The Khan and the London tradesman--Ancient Rome and modern\r\n    Britain--The sentimental defence of war as the purifier of human\r\n    life--The facts--The redirection of human pugnacity.\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite the general tendency indicated by the facts dealt with in the\r\npreceding chapter, it will be urged (with perfect justice) that, though\r\nthe methods of Anglo-Saxondom as compared with those of the Spanish,\r\nPortuguese, and French Empires, may have been mainly commercial and\r\nindustrial rather than military, war was a necessary part of expansion;\r\nthat but for some fighting the Anglo-Saxons would have been ousted from\r\nNorth America or Asia, or would never have gained a footing there.\r\n\r\nDoes this, however, prevent us establishing, on the basis of the facts\r\nexposed in the preceding chapter, a general principle sufficiently\r\ndefinite to serve as a practical guide in policy, and to indicate\r\nreliably a general tendency in human affairs? Assuredly not. The\r\nprinciple which explains the uselessness of much of the force exerted by\r\nthe military type of empire, and justifies in large part that employed\r\nby Britain, is neither obscure nor uncertain, although empiricism, rule\r\nof thumb (which is the curse of political thinking in our days, and more\r\nthan anything else stands in the way of real progress), gets over the\r\ndifficulty by declaring that no principle in human affairs can be pushed\r\nto its logical or theoretical conclusion; that what may be \"right in\r\ntheory\" is wrong in practice.\r\n\r\nThus Mr. Roosevelt, who expresses with such admirable force and vigor\r\nthe average thoughts of his hearers or readers, takes generally this\r\nline: We must be peaceful, but not too peaceful; warlike, but not too\r\nwarlike; moral, but not too moral.[87]\r\n\r\nBy such verbal mystification we are encouraged to shirk the rough and\r\nstony places along the hard road of thinking. If we cannot carry a\r\nprinciple to its logical conclusion, at what point are we to stop? One\r\nwill fix one and another will fix another with equal justice. What is it\r\nto be \"moderately\" peaceful, or \"moderately\" warlike? Temperament and\r\npredilection can stretch such limitations indefinitely. This sort of\r\nthing only darkens counsel.\r\n\r\nIf a theory is right, it can be pushed to its logical conclusion;\r\nindeed, the only real test of its value is that it _can_ be pushed to\r\nits logical conclusion. If it is wrong in practice, it is wrong in\r\ntheory, for the right theory will take cognizance of all the facts, not\r\nonly of one set.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter II. of this part (pp. 186-192), I have very broadly indicated\r\nthe process by which the employment of physical force in the affairs of\r\nthe world has been a constantly diminishing factor since the day that\r\nprimitive man killed his fellow-man in order to eat him. Yet throughout\r\nthe whole process the employment of force has been an integral part of\r\nprogress, until even to-day in the most advanced nations force--the\r\npolice-force--is an integral part of their civilization.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the principle determining the advantageous and the\r\ndisadvantageous employment of force?\r\n\r\nPreceding the outline sketch just referred to is another sketch\r\nindicating the real biological law of man's survival and advance; the\r\nkey to that law is found in co-operation between men and struggle with\r\nnature. Mankind as a whole is the organism which needs to co-ordinate\r\nits parts in order to insure greater vitality by better adaptation to\r\nits environment.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we get the key: force employed to secure completer\r\nco-operation between the parts, to facilitate exchange, makes for\r\nadvance; force which runs counter to such co-operation, which attempts\r\nto replace the mutual benefit of exchange by compulsion, which is in any\r\nway a form of parasitism, makes for retrogression.\r\n\r\nWhy is the employment of force by the police justified? Because the\r\nbandit refuses to co-operate. He does not offer an exchange; he wants to\r\nlive as a parasite, to take by force, and give nothing in exchange. If\r\nhe increased in numbers, co-operation between the various parts of the\r\norganism would be impossible; he makes for disintegration. He must be\r\nrestrained, and so long as the police use their force in such restraint\r\nthey are merely insuring co-operation. The police are not attempting to\r\nsettle things by force; they are preventing things from being settled in\r\nthat way.\r\n\r\nNow, suppose that this police-force becomes the army of a political\r\nPower, and the diplomats of that Power say to a smaller one: \"We\r\noutnumber you; we are going to annex your territory, and you are going\r\nto pay us tribute.\" And the smaller Power says: \"What are you going to\r\ngive us for that tribute?\" And the larger replies: \"Nothing. You are\r\nweak; we are strong; we gobble you up. It is the law of life; always has\r\nbeen--always will be to the end.\"\r\n\r\nNow that police-force, become an army, is no longer making for\r\nco-operation; it has simply and purely taken the place of the bandits;\r\nand to approximate such an army to a police-force, and to say that\r\nbecause both operations involve the employment of force they both stand\r\nequally justified, is to ignore half the facts, and to be guilty of\r\nthose lazy generalizations which we associate with savagery.[88]\r\n\r\nBut the difference is more than a moral one. If the reader will again\r\nreturn to the little sketch referred to above, he will probably agree\r\nthat the diplomats of the larger Power are acting in an extraordinarily\r\nstupid fashion. I say nothing of their sham philosophy (which happens,\r\nhowever, to be that of European statecraft to-day), by which this\r\naggression is made to appear in keeping with the law of man's struggle\r\nfor life, when, as a matter of fact, it is the very negation of that\r\nlaw; but we know _now_ that they are taking a course which gives the\r\nleast result, even from _their_ point of view, for the effort expended.\r\n\r\nHere we get the key also to the difference between the respective\r\nhistories of the military empires, like Spain, France, and Portugal, and\r\nthe more industrial type, like England, which has been touched upon in\r\nthe preceding chapter. Not the mere hazard of war, not a question of\r\nmere efficiency in the employment of force, has given to Great Britain\r\ninfluence in half a world, and taken it from Spain, but a radical,\r\nfundamental difference in underlying principles however imperfectly\r\nrealized. England's exercise of force has approximated on the whole to\r\nthe role of police; Spain's to that of the diplomats of the\r\nsupposititious Power just referred to. England's has made for\r\nco-operation; Spain's for the embarrassment of co-operation. England's\r\nhas been in keeping with the real law of man's struggle; Spain's in\r\nkeeping with the sham law which the \"blood and iron\" empiricists are\r\nforever throwing at our heads. For what has happened to all attempts to\r\nlive on extorted tribute? They have all failed--failed miserably and\r\nutterly[89]--to such an extent that to-day the exaction of tribute has\r\nbecome an economic impossibility.\r\n\r\nIf, however, our supposititious diplomats, instead of asking for\r\ntribute, had said: \"Your country is in disorder; your police-force is\r\ninsufficient; our merchants are robbed and killed; we will lend you\r\npolice and help you to maintain order; you will pay the police their\r\njust wage, and that is all;\" and had honestly kept to this office, their\r\nexercise of force would have aided human co-operation, not checked it.\r\nAgain, it would have been a struggle, not against man, but against the\r\nuse of force; the \"predominant Power\" would have been living, not on\r\nother men, but by more efficient organization of man's fight with\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThat is why, in the first section of this book, I have laid emphasis on\r\nthe truth that the justification of past wars has no bearing on the\r\nproblem which confronts us: the precise degree of fighting which was\r\nnecessary a hundred and fifty years ago is a somewhat academic problem.\r\nThe degree of fighting which is necessary to-day is the problem which\r\nconfronts us, and a great many factors have been introduced into it\r\nsince England won India and lost part of North America. The face of the\r\nworld has changed, and the factors of conflict have changed radically:\r\nto ignore that is to ignore facts and to be guided by the worst form of\r\ntheorizing and sentimentalism--the theorizing that will not recognize\r\nthe facts. England does not need to maintain order in Germany, nor\r\nGermany in France; and the struggle between those nations is no part of\r\nman's struggle with nature--has no justification in the real law of\r\nhuman struggle; it is an anachronism; it finds its justification in a\r\nsham philosophy that will not bear the test of facts, and, responding to\r\nno real need and achieving no real purpose, is bound with increasing\r\nenlightenment to come to an end.\r\n\r\nI wish it were not everlastingly necessary to reiterate the fact that\r\nthe world has moved. Yet for the purposes of this discussion it is\r\nnecessary. If to-day an Italian warship were suddenly to bombard\r\nLiverpool without warning, the Bourse in Rome would present a condition,\r\nand the bank-rate in Rome would take a drop that would ruin tens of\r\nthousands of Italians--do far more injury, probably, to Italy than to\r\nEngland. Yet if five hundred years ago Italian pirates had landed from\r\nthe Thames and sacked London itself, not an Italian in Italy would have\r\nbeen a penny the worse for it.\r\n\r\nIs it seriously urged that in the matter of the exercise of physical\r\nforce, therefore, there is no difference in these two conditions: and is\r\nit seriously urged that the psychological phenomena which go with the\r\nexercise of physical force are to remain unaffected?\r\n\r\nThe preceding chapter is, indeed, the historical justification of the\r\neconomic truths established in the first section of this book in the\r\nterms of the facts of the present-day world, which show that the\r\npredominating factor in survival is shifting from the physical to the\r\nintellectual plane. This evolutionary process has now reached a point in\r\ninternational affairs which involves the complete economic futility of\r\nmilitary force. In the last chapter but one I dealt with the\r\npsychological consequence of this profound change in the nature of man's\r\nnormal activities, showing that his nature is coming more and more to\r\nadapt itself to what he normally and for the greater part of his\r\nlife--in most cases all his life--is engaged in, and is losing the\r\nimpulses concerned with an abnormal and unusual occupation.\r\n\r\nWhy have I presented the facts in this order, and dealt with the\r\npsychological result involved in this change before the change itself? I\r\nhave adopted this order of treatment because the believer in war\r\njustifies his dogmatism for the most part by an appeal to what he\r\nalleges is the one dominating fact of the situation--_i.e._, that human\r\nnature is unchanging. Well, as will be seen from the chapter on that\r\nsubject, that alleged fact does not bear investigation. Human nature is\r\nchanging out of all recognition. Not only is man fighting less, but he\r\nis using all forms of physical compulsion less, and as a very natural\r\nresult is losing those psychological attributes that go with the\r\nemployment of physical force. And he is coming to employ physical force\r\nless because accumulated evidence is pushing him more and more to the\r\nconclusion that he can accomplish more easily that which he strives for\r\nby other means.\r\n\r\nFew of us realize to what extent economic pressure--and I use that term\r\nin its just sense, as meaning, not only the struggle for money, but\r\neverything implied therein, well-being, social consideration, and the\r\nrest--has replaced physical force in human affairs. The primitive mind\r\ncould not conceive a world in which everything was not regulated by\r\nforce: even the great minds of antiquity could not believe the world\r\nwould be an industrious one unless the great mass were made industrious\r\nby the use of physical force--_i.e._, by slavery. Three-fourths of those\r\nwho peopled what is now Italy in Rome's palmiest days were slaves,\r\nchained in the fields when at work, chained at night in their\r\ndormitories, with those who were porters chained to the doorways. It was\r\na society of slavery--fighting slaves, working slaves, cultivating\r\nslaves, official slaves, and Gibbon adds that the Emperor himself was a\r\nslave, \"the first slave to the ceremonies he imposed.\" Great and\r\npenetrating as were many of the minds of antiquity, none of them show\r\nmuch conception of any condition of society in which the economic\r\nimpulse could replace physical compulsion.[90] Had they been told that\r\nthe time would come when the world would work very much harder under\r\nthe impulse of an abstract thing known as economic interest, they would\r\nhave regarded such a statement as that of a mere sentimental theorist.\r\nIndeed, one need not go so far: if one had told an American slaveholder\r\nof sixty years ago that the time would come when the South would produce\r\nmore cotton under the free pressure of economic forces than under\r\nslavery, he would have made a like reply. He would probably have\r\ndeclared that \"a good cowhide whip beats all economic pressure\"--pretty\r\nmuch the sort of thing that one may hear from the mouth of the average\r\nmilitarist to-day. Very \"practical\" and virile, of course, but it has\r\nthe disadvantage of not being true.\r\n\r\nThe presumed necessity for physical compulsion did not stop at slavery.\r\nAs we have already seen, it was accepted as an axiom in statecraft that\r\nmen's religious beliefs had to be forcibly restrained, and not merely\r\ntheir religious belief, but their very clothing; and we have hundreds of\r\nyears of complicated sumptuary laws, hundreds of years, also, of\r\nforcible control or, rather, the attempted forcible control of prices\r\nand trade, the elaborate system of monopolies, absolute prohibition of\r\nthe entrance into the country of certain foreign goods, the violation of\r\nwhich prohibition was treated as a penal offence. We had even the use of\r\nforced money, the refusal to accept which was treated as a penal\r\noffence. In many countries for years it was a crime to send gold abroad,\r\nall indicating the domination of the mind of man by the same curious\r\nobsession that man's life must be ruled by physical force, and it is\r\nonly very slowly and very painfully that we have arrived at the truth\r\nthat men will work best when left to unseen and invisible forces. A\r\nworld in which physical force was withdrawn from the regulation of men's\r\nlabor, faith, clothes, trade, language, travel, would have been\r\nabsolutely inconceivable to even the best minds during the three or four\r\nthousand years of history which mainly concern us. What is the central\r\nexplanation of the profound change involved here--the shifting of the\r\npivot in all human affairs, in so far as they touch both the individual\r\nand the community, from physical ponderable forces to economic\r\nimponderable forces? It is surely that, strange as it may seem, the\r\nlatter forces accomplish the desired result more efficiently and more\r\nreadily than do the former, which even when they are not completely\r\nfutile are in comparison wasteful and stultifying. It is the law of the\r\neconomy of effort. Indeed, the use of physical force usually involves in\r\nthose employing it the same limitation of freedom (even if in lesser\r\ndegree) as that which it is desired to impose. Herbert Spencer\r\nillustrates the process in the following suggestive passage:\r\n\r\n     The exercise of mastery inevitably entails on the master\r\n     himself some sort of slavery more or less pronounced. The\r\n     uncultured masses and even the greater part of the cultured\r\n     will regard this statement as absurd, and though many who have\r\n     read history with an eye to essentials rather than to\r\n     trivialities know that this is a paradox in the right\r\n     sense--that is, true in fact though not seeming true--even\r\n     they are not fully conscious of the mass of evidence\r\n     establishing it, and will be all the better for having\r\n     illustrations recalled. Let me begin with the earliest and\r\n     simplest which serves to symbolize the whole.\r\n\r\n     Here is a prisoner, with his hands tied and a cord round his\r\n     neck (as suggested by figures in Assyrian bas-reliefs), being\r\n     led home by his savage conqueror, who intends to make him a\r\n     slave. The one you say is captive and the other free. Are you\r\n     quite sure the other is free? He holds one end of the cord and,\r\n     unless he means his captive to escape, he must continue to be\r\n     fastened by keeping hold of the cord in such way that it cannot\r\n     easily be detached. He must be himself tied to the captive\r\n     while the captive is tied to him. In other ways his activities\r\n     are impeded and certain burdens are imposed on him. A wild\r\n     animal crosses the track and he cannot pursue. If he wishes to\r\n     drink of the adjacent stream he must tie up his captive, lest\r\n     advantage be taken of his defenceless position. Moreover, he\r\n     has to provide food for both. In various ways he is no longer,\r\n     then, completely at liberty; and these worries adumbrate in a\r\n     simple manner the universal truth that the instrumentalities by\r\n     which the subordination of others is effected themselves\r\n     subordinate the victor, the master, or the ruler.[91]\r\n\r\nThus it comes that all nations attempting to live by conquest end by\r\nbeing themselves the victims of a military tyranny precisely similar to\r\nthat which they hope to inflict; or, in other terms, that the attempt to\r\nimpose by force of arms a disadvantageous commercial situation to the\r\nadvantage of the conqueror ends in the conqueror's falling a victim to\r\nthe very disadvantages from which he hoped by a process of spoliation\r\nto profit.\r\n\r\nBut the truth that economic force always in the long run outweighs\r\nphysical or military force is illustrated by the simple fact of the\r\nuniversal use of money--the fact that the use of money is not a thing\r\nwhich we choose or can shake off, but a thing imposed by the operation\r\nof forces stronger than our volition, stronger than the tyranny of the\r\ncruellest tyrant who ever reigned by blood and iron. I think it is one\r\nof the most astounding things, to the man who takes a fairly fresh mind\r\nto the study of history, that the most absolute despots--men who can\r\ncommand the lives of their subjects with a completeness and a\r\nnonchalance of which the modern Western world furnishes no\r\nparallel--cannot command money. One asks oneself, indeed, why such an\r\nabsolute ruler, able as he is by the sheer might of his position and by\r\nthe sheer force of his power to take everything that exists in his\r\nkingdom, and able as he is to exact every sort and character of service,\r\nneeds money, which is the means of obtaining goods or services by a\r\nfreely consented exchange. Yet, as we know, it is precisely, in ancient\r\nas in modern times, the most absolute despot who is often the most\r\nfinancially embarrassed.[92] Is not this a demonstration that in reality\r\nphysical force is operative in only very narrow limits? It is no mere\r\nrhetoric, but the cold truth, to say that under absolutism it is a\r\nsimple thing to get men's lives, but often impossible to get money. And\r\nthe more, apparently, that physical force was exercised, the more\r\ndifficult did the command of money become. And for a very simple\r\nreason--a reason which reveals in rudimentary form that principle of the\r\neconomic futility of military power with which we are dealing. The\r\nphenomenon is best illustrated by a concrete case. If one go to-day into\r\none of the independent despotisms of Central Asia one will find\r\ngenerally a picture of the most abject poverty. Why? Because the ruler\r\nhas absolute power to take wealth whenever he sees it, to take it by any\r\nmeans whatever--torture, death--up to the completest limit of\r\nuncontrolled physical force. What is the result? The wealth is not\r\ncreated, and torture itself cannot produce a thing which is\r\nnon-existent. Step across the frontier into a State under British or\r\nRussian protection, where the Khan has some sort of limits imposed on\r\nhis powers. The difference is immediately perceptible: evidence of\r\nwealth and comfort in relative profusion, and, other things being equal,\r\nthe ruler, whose physical force over his subjects is limited, is a great\r\ndeal richer than the ruler whose physical force over his subjects is\r\nunlimited. In other words, the farther one gets away from physical\r\nforce, in the acquisition of wealth, the greater is the result for the\r\neffort expended. At the one end of the scale you get the despot in rags,\r\nexercising sway over what is probably a potentially rich territory,\r\nreduced to having to kill a man by torture in order to obtain a sum\r\nwhich at the other end of the scale a London tradesman will spend on a\r\nrestaurant dinner for the purpose of sitting at table with a duke--or\r\nthe thousandth part of the sum which the same tradesman will spend in\r\nphilanthropy or otherwise, for the sake of acquiring an empty title from\r\na monarch who has lost all power of exercising any physical force\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\nWhich process, judged by all things that men desire, gives the better\r\nresult, the physical force of blood and iron which we see, or the\r\nintellectual or psychic force which we cannot see? The principle which\r\noperates in the limited fashion which I have indicated, operates with no\r\nless force in the larger domain of modern international politics. The\r\nwealth of the world is not represented by a fixed amount of gold or\r\nmoney now in the possession of one Power, and now in the possession of\r\nanother, but depends on all the unchecked multiple activities of a\r\ncommunity for the time being. Check that activity, whether by imposing\r\ntribute, or disadvantageous commercial conditions, or an unwelcome\r\nadministration which sets up sterile political agitation, and you get\r\nless wealth--less wealth for the conqueror, as well as less for the\r\nconquered. The broadest statement of the case is that all\r\nexperience--especially the experience indicated in the last\r\nchapter--shows that in trade by free consent, carrying mutual benefit,\r\nwe get larger results for effort expended than in the exercise of\r\nphysical force, which attempts to exact advantage for one party at the\r\nexpense of the other. I am not arguing over again the thesis of the\r\nfirst part of this book; but, as we shall see presently, the general\r\nprinciple of the diminishing factor of physical force in the affairs of\r\nthe world carries with it a psychological change in human nature which\r\nmodifies radically our impulses to sheer physical conflict. What it is\r\nimportant just now to keep in mind, is the incalculable intensification\r\nof this diminution of physical force by our mechanical development. The\r\nprinciple was obviously less true for Rome than it is for Great Britain\r\nor America: Rome, however imperfectly, lived largely by tribute. The\r\nsheer mechanical development of the modern world has rendered tribute in\r\nthe Roman sense impossible. Rome did not have to create markets and find\r\na field for the employment of her capital. We do. What result does this\r\ncarry? Rome could afford to be relatively indifferent to the prosperity\r\nof her subject territory. We cannot. If the territory is not prosperous\r\nwe have no market, and we have no field for our investments, and that is\r\nwhy we are checked at every point from doing what Rome was able to do.\r\nYou can to some extent exact tribute by force; you cannot compel a man\r\nto buy your goods by force if he does not want them, and has not got the\r\nmoney to pay for them. Now, the difference which we see here has been\r\nbrought about by the interaction of a whole series of mechanical\r\nchanges--printing, gunpowder, steam, electricity, improved means of\r\ncommunication. It is the last-named which has mainly created the fact\r\nof credit. Now, credit is merely an extension of the use of money, and\r\nwe can no more shake off the domination of the one than we can that of\r\nthe other. We have seen that the bloodiest despot is himself the slave\r\nof money, in the sense that he is compelled to employ it. In the same\r\nway no physical force can, in the modern world, set at nought the force\r\nof credit.[93] It is no more possible for a great people of the modern\r\nworld to live without credit than without money, of which it is a part.\r\nDo we not here get an illustration of the fact that intangible economic\r\nforces are setting at nought the force of arms?\r\n\r\nOne of the curiosities of this mechanical development, with its\r\ndeep-seated psychological results, is the general failure to realize the\r\nreal bearings of each step therein. Printing was regarded, in the first\r\ninstance, as merely a new-fangled process which threw a great many\r\ncopying scribes and monks out of employment. Who realized that in the\r\nsimple invention of printing there was the liberation of a force greater\r\nthan the power of kings? It is only here and there that we find an\r\nisolated thinker having a glimmering of the political bearing of such\r\ninventions of the conception of the great truth that the more man\r\nsucceeds in his struggle with nature, the less must be the role of\r\nphysical force between men, for the reason that human society has\r\nbecome, with each success in the struggle against nature, a completer\r\norganism. That is to say, that the interdependence of the parts has\r\nbeen increased, and that the possibility of one part injuring another\r\nwithout injury to itself, has been diminished. Each part is more\r\ndependent on the other parts, and the impulses to injury, therefore,\r\nmust in the nature of things be diminished. And that fact must, and\r\ndoes, daily redirect human pugnacity. And it is noteworthy that perhaps\r\nthe best service which the improvement of the instruments of man's\r\nstruggle with nature performs is the improvement of human relations.\r\nMachinery and the steam-engine have done something more than make\r\nfortunes for manufacturers: they have abolished human slavery, as\r\nAristotle foresaw they would. It was impossible for men in the mass to\r\nbe other than superstitious and irrational until they had the printed\r\nbook.[94] \"Roads that are formed for the circulation of wealth become\r\nchannels for the circulation of ideas, and render possible that\r\nsimultaneous action upon which all liberty depends.\" Banking done by\r\ntelegraphy concerns much more than the stockbroker: it demonstrates\r\nclearly and dramatically the real interdependence of nations, and is\r\ndestined to transform the mind of the statesman. Our struggle is with\r\nour environment, not with one another; and those who talk as though\r\nstruggle between the parts of the same organism must necessarily go on,\r\nand as though impulses which are redirected every day can never receive\r\nthe particular redirection involved in abandoning the struggle between\r\nStates, ignorantly adopt the formula of science, but leave half the\r\nfacts out of consideration. And just as the direction of the impulses\r\nwill be changed, so will the character of the struggle be changed; the\r\nforce which we shall use for our needs will be the force of\r\nintelligence, of hard work, of character, of patience, self-control, and\r\na developed brain, and pugnacity and combativeness which, instead of\r\nbeing used up and wasted in world conflicts of futile destructiveness,\r\nwill be, and are being, diverted into the steady stream of\r\nrationally-directed effort. The virile impulses become, not the tyrant\r\nand master, but the tool and servant of the controlling brain.\r\n\r\nThe conception of abstract imponderable forces by the human mind is a\r\nvery slow process. All man's history reveals this. The theologian has\r\nalways felt this difficulty. For thousands of years men could only\r\nconceive of evil as an animal with horns and a tail, going about the\r\nworld devouring folk; abstract conceptions had to be made understandable\r\nby a crude anthropomorphism. Perhaps it is better that humanity should\r\nhave some glimmering of the great facts of the universe, even though\r\ninterpreted by legends of demons, and goblins, and fairies, and the\r\nrest; but we cannot overlook the truth that the facts are distorted in\r\nthe process, and our advance in the conception of morals is marked\r\nlargely by the extent to which we can form an abstract conception of the\r\nfact of evil--none the less a fact because unembodied--without having to\r\ntranslate it into a non-existent person or animal with a forked tail.\r\n\r\nAs our advance in the understanding of morality is marked by our\r\ndropping these crude physical conceptions, is it not likely that our\r\nadvance in the understanding of those social problems, which so nearly\r\naffect our general well-being, will be marked in like manner?\r\n\r\nIs it not somewhat childish and elementary to conceive of force only as\r\nthe firing off of guns and the launching of _Dreadnoughts_, of struggle\r\nas the physical struggle between men, instead of the application of\r\nman's energies to his contest with the planet? Is not the time coming\r\nwhen the real struggle will inspire us with the same respect and even\r\nthe same thrill as that now inspired by a charge in battle; especially\r\nas the charges in battle are getting very out of date, and are shortly\r\nto disappear from our warfare? The mind which can only conceive of\r\nstruggle as bombardment and charges is, of course, the Dervish mind. Not\r\nthat Fuzzy-Wuzzy is not a fine fellow. He is manly, sturdy, hardy, with\r\na courage, and warlike qualities generally, which no European can equal.\r\nBut the frail and spectacled English official is his master, and a few\r\nscore of such will make themselves the masters of teeming thousands of\r\nSudanese; the relatively unwarlike Englishman is doing the same thing\r\nall over Asia, and he is doing it simply by virtue of superior brain\r\nand character, more thought, more rationalism, more steady and\r\ncontrolled hard work. The American is doing the same in the Philippines.\r\nIt may be said that it is superior armament which does it. But what is\r\nthe superior armament but the result of superior thought and work? And\r\neven without the superior armament the larger intelligence would still\r\ndo it; for what the Englishman and American do, the Roman did of old,\r\nwith the same arms as the inhabitants of his vassal worlds. Force is\r\nindeed the master, but it is the force of intelligence, character, and\r\nrationalism.\r\n\r\nI can imagine the contempt with which the man of physical force greets\r\nthe foregoing. To fight with words, to fight with talk! No, not words,\r\nbut ideas. And something more than ideas. Their translation into\r\npractical effort, into organization, into the direction and\r\nadministration of organization, into the strategy and tactics of human\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWhat, indeed, is modern warfare in its highest phases but this? Is it\r\nnot altogether out of date and ignorant to picture soldiering as riding\r\nabout on horseback, bivouacking in forests, sleeping in tents, and\r\ndashing gallantly at the head of shining regiments in plumes and\r\nbreastplates, and pounding in serried ranks against the equally serried\r\nranks of the cruel foe, storming breaches as the \"war,\" in short, of Mr.\r\nHenty's books for boys? How far does such a conception correspond to the\r\nreality--to the German conception? Even if the whole picture were not\r\nout of date, what proportion of the most military nation would ever be\r\ndestined to witness it or to take part in it? Not one in ten thousand.\r\nWhat is the character even of military conflict but, for the most part,\r\nyears of hard and steady work, somewhat mechanical, somewhat divorced\r\nfrom real life, but not a whit more exciting? That is true of all ranks;\r\nand in the higher ranks of the directing mind war has become an almost\r\npurely intellectual process. Was it not the late W.H. Steevens who\r\npainted Lord Kitchener as the sort of man who would have made an\r\nadmirable manager of Harrod's Stores; who fought all his battles in his\r\nstudy, and regarded the actual fighting as the mere culminating incident\r\nin the whole process, the dirty and noisy part of it, which he would\r\nhave been glad to get away from?\r\n\r\nThe real soldiers of our time--those who represent the brain of the\r\narmies--have a life not very different from that of men of any\r\nintellectual calling; much less of physical strife than is called for in\r\nmany civil occupations; less than falls to the lot of engineers,\r\nranchers, sailors, miners, and so on. Even with armies the pugnacity\r\nmust be translated into intellectual and not into physical effort.[95]\r\n\r\nThe very fact that war was long an activity which was in some sense a\r\nchange and relaxation from the more intellectual strife of peaceful\r\nlife, in which work was replaced by danger, thought by adventure,\r\naccounted in no small part for its attraction for men. But, as we have\r\nseen, war is becoming as hopelessly intellectual and scientific as any\r\nother form of work: officers are scientists, the men are workmen, the\r\narmy is a machine, battles are \"tactical operations,\" the charge is\r\nbecoming out of date; a little while and war will become the least\r\nromantic of all professions.\r\n\r\nIn this domain, as in all others, intellectual force is replacing sheer\r\nphysical force, and we are being pushed by the necessities even of this\r\nstruggle to be more rational in our attitude to war, to rationalize our\r\nstudy of it; and as our attitude generally becomes more scientific, so\r\nwill the purely impulsive element lose its empire over us. That is one\r\nfactor; but, of course, there is the greater one. Our respect and\r\nadmiration goes in the long run, despite momentary setbacks, to those\r\nqualities which achieve the results at which we are all, in common,\r\naiming. If those results are mainly intellectual, it is the intellectual\r\nqualities that will receive the tribute of our admiration. We do not\r\nmake a man President because he holds the light-weight boxing\r\nchampionship, and nobody knows or cares whether Mr. Wilson or Mr. Taft\r\nwould be the better man at golf. But in a condition of society in which\r\nphysical force was still the determining factor it would matter all in\r\nthe world, and even when other factors had obtained considerable weight,\r\nas during the Middle Ages, physical combat went for a great deal: the\r\nknight in his shining armor established his prestige by his prowess in\r\narms, and the vestige of this still remains in those countries that\r\nretain the duel. To some small extent--a very small extent--a man's\r\ndexterity with sword and pistol will affect his political prestige in\r\nParis, Rome, Budapest, or Berlin. But these are just interesting\r\nvestiges, which in the case of Anglo-Saxon societies have disappeared\r\nentirely. My commercial friend who declares that he works fifteen hours\r\na day mainly for the purpose of going one better than his commercial\r\nrival across the street, must beat that rival in commerce, not in arms;\r\nit would satisfy no pride of either to \"have it out\" in the back garden\r\nin their shirt-sleeves. Nor is there the least danger that one will\r\nstick a knife into the other.\r\n\r\nAre all these factors to leave the national relationship unaffected?\r\nHave they left it unaffected? Does the military prowess of Russia or of\r\nTurkey inspire any particular satisfaction in the minds of the\r\nindividual Russian or of the individual Turk? Does it inspire Europe\r\nwith any especial respect? Would not most of us just as soon be a\r\nnon-military American as a military Turk? Do not, in short, all the\r\nfactors show that sheer physical force is losing its prestige as much in\r\nthe national as in the personal relationship?\r\n\r\nI am not overlooking the case of Germany. Does the history of Germany,\r\nduring the last half-century, show the blind instinctive pugnacity which\r\nis supposed to be so overpowering an element in international\r\nrelationship as to outweigh all question of material interest? Does the\r\ncommonly accepted history of the trickery and negotiation which preceded\r\nthe 1870 conflict, the cool calculation of those who swayed Germany's\r\npolicy during those years, show that subordination to the blind lust for\r\nbattle which the militarist would persuade us is always to be an element\r\nin our international conflict? Does it not, on the contrary, show that\r\nGerman destinies were swayed by very cool and calculating motives of\r\ninterest, though interest interpreted in terms of political and economic\r\ndoctrines which the development of the last thirty years or so has\r\ndemonstrated to be obsolete? Nor am I overlooking the \"Prussian\r\ntradition,\" the fact of a firmly entrenched, aristocratic status, the\r\nintellectual legacy of pagan knighthood and Heaven knows what else. But\r\neven a Prussian Junker becomes less of an energumen as he becomes more\r\nof a scientist,[96] and although German science has of late spent its\r\nenergies in somewhat arid specialization, the influence of more\r\nenlightened conceptions in sociology and statecraft must sooner or later\r\nemerge from any thoroughgoing study of political and economic problems.\r\nOf course, there are survivals of the old temper, but can it seriously\r\nbe argued that, when the futility of physical force to accomplish those\r\nends towards which we are all striving is fully demonstrated, we shall\r\ngo on maintaining war as a sort of theatrical entertainment? Has such a\r\nthing ever happened in the past, when our impulses and \"sporting\"\r\ninstincts came into conflict with our larger social and economic\r\ninterests?\r\n\r\nAll this, in other words, involves a great deal more than the mere\r\nchange in the character of warfare. It involves a fundamental change in\r\nour psychological attitude thereto. Not only does it show that on every\r\nside, even the military side, conflict must become less impulsive and\r\ninstinctive, more rational and sustained, less the blind strife of\r\nmutually hating men, and more and more the calculated effort to a\r\ndefinite end; but it will affect the very well-springs of much of the\r\npresent defence of war.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that the authorities I have quoted in the first chapter of\r\nthis section--Mr. Roosevelt, Von Moltke, Renan, and the English\r\nclergymen--sing the praises of war as such a valuable school of\r\nmorals?[97] Do these war advocates urge that war itself is desirable?\r\nWould they urge going to war unnecessarily or unjustly merely because it\r\nis good for us? Emphatically no. Their argument, in the last analysis,\r\nresolves itself into this: that war, though bad, has redeeming\r\nqualities, as teaching staunchness, courage, and the rest. Well, so has\r\ncutting our legs off, or an operation for appendicitis. Whoever\r\ncomposed epics on typhoid fever or cancer? Such advocates might object\r\nto the efficient policing of a town because, if it was full of\r\ncut-throats, the inhabitants would be taught courage. One can almost\r\nimagine this sort of teacher pouring scorn upon those weaklings who want\r\nto call upon the police for protection, and saying, \"Police are for\r\nsentimentalists and cowards and men of slothful ease. What will become\r\nof the strenuous life if you introduce police?\"[98]\r\n\r\nThe whole thing falls to the ground; and if we do not compose poems\r\nabout typhoid it is because typhoid does not attract us and war does.\r\nThat is the bottom of the whole matter, and it simplifies things a great\r\ndeal to admit honestly that while no one is thrilled by the spectacle of\r\ndisease, most of us are thrilled by the spectacle of war--that while\r\nnone of us are fascinated by the spectacle of a man struggling with a\r\ndisease, most of us are by the spectacle of men struggling with one\r\nanother in war. There is something in warfare, in its story and in its\r\nparaphernalia, which profoundly stirs the emotions and sends the blood\r\ntingling through the veins of the most peaceable of us, and appeals to I\r\nknow not what remote instincts, to say nothing of our natural admiration\r\nfor courage, our love of adventure, of intense movement and action. But\r\nthis romantic fascination resides to no small extent in that very\r\nspectacular quality of which modern conditions are depriving war.\r\n\r\nAs we become a little more educated, we realize that human psychology is\r\na complex and not a simple thing; that because we yield ourselves to\r\nthe thrill of the battle spectacle we are not bound to conclude that the\r\nprocesses behind it, and the nature behind it, are necessarily all\r\nadmirable; that the readiness to die is not the only test of virility or\r\na fine or noble nature.\r\n\r\nIn the book to which I have just referred (Mr. Steevens' \"With Kitchener\r\nto Khartoum\") one may read the following:\r\n\r\n     And the Dervishes? The honor of the fight must still go with\r\n     the men who died. Our men were perfect, but the Dervishes were\r\n     superb--beyond perfection. It was their largest, best, and\r\n     bravest army that ever fought against us for Mahdism, and it\r\n     died worthily for the huge empire that Mahdism won and kept so\r\n     long. Their riflemen, mangled by every kind of death and\r\n     torment that man can devise, clung round the black flag and the\r\n     green, emptying their poor, rotten home-made cartridges\r\n     dauntlessly. Their spearmen charged death every minute\r\n     hopelessly. Their horsemen led each attack, riding into the\r\n     bullets till nothing was left.... Not one rush, or two, or ten,\r\n     but rush on rush, company on company, never stopping, though\r\n     all their view that was not unshaken enemy was the bodies of\r\n     the men who had rushed before them. A dusky line got up and\r\n     stormed forward: it bent, broke up, fell apart, and\r\n     disappeared. Before the smoke had cleared another line was\r\n     bending and storming forward in the same track.... From the\r\n     green army there now came only death-enamored desperadoes,\r\n     strolling one by one towards the rifles, pausing to take a\r\n     spear, turning aside to recognize a corpse, then, caught by a\r\n     sudden jet of fury, bounding forward, checking, sinking limply\r\n     to the ground. Now under the black flag in a ring of bodies\r\n     stood only three men, facing the three thousand of the Third\r\n     Brigade. They folded their arms about the staff and gazed\r\n     steadily forward. Two fell. The last Dervish stood up and\r\n     filled his chest; he shouted the name of his God and hurled his\r\n     spear. Then he stood quite still, waiting. It took him full; he\r\n     quivered, gave at the knees, and toppled with his head on his\r\n     arms and his face towards the legions of his conquerors.\"\r\n\r\nLet us be honest. Is there anything in European history--Cambronne, the\r\nLight Brigade, anything you like--more magnificent than this? If we are\r\nhonest we shall say, No.\r\n\r\nBut note what follows in Mr. Steevens' narrative. What sort of nature\r\nshould we expect those savage heroes to display? Cruel, perhaps; but at\r\nleast loyal. They will stand by their chief. Men who can die like that\r\nwill not betray him for gain. They are uncorrupted by commercialism.\r\nWell, a few chapters after the scene just described, one may read this:\r\n\r\n     As a ruler the Khalifa finished when he rode out of Omdurman.\r\n     His own pampered Baggara horsemen killed his herdsmen and\r\n     looted the cattle that were to feed them. Somebody betrayed the\r\n     position of the reserve camels.... His followers took to\r\n     killing one another.... The whole population of the Khalifa's\r\n     capital was now racing to pilfer the Khalifa's grain....\r\n     Wonderful workings of the savage mind! Six hours before they\r\n     were dying in regiments for their master; now they were looting\r\n     his corn. Six hours before they were slashing our wounded to\r\n     pieces; now they were asking us for coppers.\r\n\r\nThis difficulty with the soldier's psychology is not special to\r\nDervishes or to savages. An able and cultivated British officer writes:\r\n\r\n     Soldiers as a class are men who have disregarded the civil\r\n     standard of morality altogether. They simply ignore it. It is\r\n     no doubt why civilians fight shy of them. In the game of life\r\n     they do not play the same rules, and the consequence is a good\r\n     deal of misunderstanding, until finally the civilian says he\r\n     will not play with Tommy any more. In soldiers' eyes lying,\r\n     theft, drunkenness, bad language, etc., are not evils at all.\r\n     They steal like jackdaws. As to language, I used to think the\r\n     language of a merchant ship's forecastle pretty bad, but the\r\n     language of Tommies, in point of profanity and in point of\r\n     obscenity, beats it hollow. This department is a speciality of\r\n     his. Lying he treats with the same large charity. To lie like a\r\n     trooper is quite a sound metaphor. He invents all sorts of\r\n     elaborate lies for the mere pleasure of inventing them.\r\n     Looting, again, is one of his preferred joys, not merely\r\n     looting for profit, but looting for the sheer fun of the\r\n     destruction.[99]\r\n\r\n(Please, please, dear reader, do not say that I am slandering the\r\nBritish soldier. I am quoting a British officer, and a British officer,\r\nmoreover, who is keenly in sympathy with the person that he has just\r\nbeen describing.) He adds:\r\n\r\n     Are thieving, and lying, and looting, and bestial talk very bad\r\n     things? If they are, Tommy is a bad man. But for some reason or\r\n     other, since I got to know him, I have thought rather less of\r\n     the iniquity of these things than I did before.\r\n\r\nI do not know which of the two passages that I have quoted is the more\r\nstriking commentary on the moral influence of military training; that\r\nsuch training should have the effect which Captain March Phillips\r\ndescribes, or (as Mr. J.A. Hobson in his \"Psychology of Jingoism\" says)\r\nthat the second judgment should be given by a man of sterling character\r\nand culture--the judgment, that thieving, and lying, and looting, and\r\nbestial talk do not matter. Which fact constitutes the severer\r\ncondemnation of the ethical atmosphere of militarism and military\r\ntraining? Which is the more convincing testimony to the corrupting\r\ninfluences of war?[100]\r\n\r\nTo do the soldiers justice, they very rarely raise this plea of war\r\nbeing a moral training-school. \"War itself,\" said an officer on one\r\noccasion, \"is an infernally dirty business. But somebody has got to do\r\nthe dirty work of the world, and I am glad to think that it is the\r\nbusiness of the soldier to prevent rather than to make war.\"\r\n\r\nNot that I am concerned to deny that we owe a great deal to the soldier.\r\nI do not know even why we should deny that we owe a great deal to the\r\nViking. Neither the one nor the other was in every aspect despicable.\r\nBoth have bequeathed a heritage of courage, sturdiness, hardihood, and a\r\nspirit of ordered adventure; the capacity to take hard knocks and to\r\ngive them; comradeship and rough discipline--all this and much more. It\r\nis not true to say of any emotion that it is wholly and absolutely good,\r\nor wholly and absolutely bad. The same psychological force which made\r\nthe Vikings destructive and cruel pillagers made their descendants\r\nsturdy and resolute pioneers and colonists; and the same emotional force\r\nwhich turns so much of Africa into a sordid and bloody shambles would,\r\nwith a different direction and distribution, turn it into a garden. Is\r\nit for nothing that the splendid Scandinavian race, who have converted\r\ntheir rugged and rock-strewn peninsula into a group of prosperous and\r\nstable States, which are an example to Europe, and have infused the\r\ngreat Anglo-Saxon stock with something of their sane but noble idealism,\r\nhave the blood of Vikings in their veins? Is there no place for the free\r\nplay of all the best qualities of the Viking and the soldier in a world\r\nstill sadly in need of men with courage enough, for instance, to face\r\nthe truth, however difficult it may seem, however unkind to our pet\r\nprejudices?\r\n\r\nThere is not the least necessity for the peace advocate to ignore facts\r\nin this matter. The race of man loves a soldier just as boys love the\r\npirate, and many of us, perhaps to our great advantage, remain in part\r\nboys our lives through. But as, growing out of boyhood, we regretfully\r\ndiscover the sad fact that we cannot be pirates, that we cannot even\r\nhunt Indians, nor be scouts, nor even trappers, so surely the time has\r\ncome to realize that we have grown out of soldiering. The romantic\r\nappeal of the ventures of the old Vikings, and even later of\r\npiracy,[101] was as great as that of war. Yet we superseded the Viking,\r\nand we hanged the pirate, though I doubt not we loved him while we\r\nhanged him; and I am not aware that those who urged the suppression of\r\npiracy were vilified, except by the pirates, as maudlin sentimentalists,\r\nwho ignored human nature, or, in Homer Lea's phrase, as \"half-educated,\r\nsick-brained visionaries, denying the inexorability of the primordial\r\nlaw of struggle.\" Piracy interfered seriously with the trade and\r\nindustry of those who desired to earn for themselves as good a living as\r\nthey could get, and to obtain from this imperfect world all that it had\r\nto offer. Piracy was magnificent, doubtless, but it was not business. We\r\nare prepared to sing about the Viking, but not to tolerate him on the\r\nhigh seas; and some of us who are quite prepared to give the soldier his\r\ndue place in poetry and legend and romance, quite prepared to admit,\r\nwith Mr. Roosevelt and Von Moltke and the rest, the qualities which\r\nperhaps we owe to him, and without which we should be poor folk indeed,\r\nare nevertheless inquiring whether the time has not come to place him\r\n(or a good portion of him) gently on the poetic shelf with the Viking;\r\nor at least to find other fields for those activities which, however\r\nmuch we may be attracted by them, have in their present form little\r\nplace in a world in which, though, as Bacon has said, men like danger\r\nbetter than travail, travail is bound, alas!--despite ourselves--to be\r\nour lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE STATE AS A PERSON: A FALSE ANALOGY AND ITS CONSEQUENCES\r\n\r\n    Why aggression upon a State does not correspond to aggression\r\n    upon an individual--Our changing conception of collective\r\n    responsibility--Psychological progress in this connection--Recent\r\n    growth of factors breaking down the homogeneous personality of\r\n    States.\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite the common idea to the contrary, we dearly love an\r\nabstraction--especially, apparently, an abstraction which is based on\r\nhalf the facts. Whatever the foregoing chapters may have proved, they\r\nhave at least proved this: that the character of the modern State, by\r\nvirtue of a multitude of new factors which are special to our age, is\r\nessentially and fundamentally different from that of the ancient. Yet\r\neven those who have great and justified authority in this matter will\r\nstill appeal to Aristotle's conception of the State as final, with the\r\nimplication that everything which has happened since Aristotle's time\r\nshould be calmly disregarded.\r\n\r\nWhat some of those things are, the preceding chapters have indicated:\r\nFirst, there is the fact of the change in human nature itself, bound up\r\nwith the general drift away from the use of physical force--a drift\r\nexplained by the unromantic fact that physical force does not give so\r\nmuch response to expended effort as do other forms of energy. There is\r\nan interconnection of psychological and purely mechanical development in\r\nall this which it is not necessary to disentangle here. The results are\r\nevident enough. Very rarely, and to an infinitesimal extent, do we now\r\nemploy force for the achievement of our ends. There is still a factor,\r\nhowever, which remains to be considered, and which has perhaps a more\r\ndirect bearing on the question of continued conflict between nations\r\nthan any of the other factors.\r\n\r\nConflicts between nations and international pugnacity generally imply a\r\nconception of a State as a homogeneous whole, having the same sort of\r\nresponsibility that we attach to a person who, hitting us, provokes us\r\nto hit back. Now only to a very small and rapidly diminishing extent can\r\na State be regarded as such a person. There may have been a\r\ntime--Aristotle's time--when this was possible; but it is now\r\nimpossible. Yet the fine-spun theories on which are based the necessity\r\nfor the use of force, as between nations, and the proposition that the\r\nrelationship of nations can only be determined by force, and that\r\ninternational pugnacity will always be expressed by a physical struggle\r\nbetween nations, all arise from this fatal analogy, which in truth\r\ncorresponds to very few of the facts.\r\n\r\nThus Professor Spenser Wilkinson, whose contributions to this subject\r\nhave such deserved weight, implies that what will permanently render\r\nthe abandonment of force between nations impossible is the principle\r\nthat \"the employment of force for the maintenance of right is the\r\nfoundation of all civilized human life, for it is the fundamental\r\nfunction of the State, and apart from the State there is no\r\ncivilization, no life worth living.... The mark of the State is\r\nsovereignty, or the identification of force and right, and the measure\r\nof the perfection of the State is furnished by the completeness of this\r\nidentification.\"\r\n\r\nThis, whether true or not, is irrelevant to the matter in hand.\r\nProfessor Spenser Wilkinson attempts to illustrate his thesis by quoting\r\na case which would seem to imply that those who take their stand against\r\nthe necessity of armaments do so on the ground that the employment of\r\nforce is wicked. There may be those who do this, but it is not necessary\r\nto introduce the question of right. If means other than force give the\r\nsame result more easily, with less effort to ourselves, why discuss the\r\nabstract right? When Professor Spenser Wilkinson reinforces the appeal\r\nto this irrelevant abstract principle by a case which, while apparently\r\nrelevant, is in truth irrelevant, he has successfully confused the whole\r\nissue. After quoting three verses from the fifth chapter of Matthew, he\r\nsays:[102]\r\n\r\n     There are those who believe, or fancy they believe, that the\r\n     words I have quoted involve the principle that the use of force\r\n     or violence between man and man or between nation and nation\r\n     is wicked. To the man who thinks it right to submit to any\r\n     violence or be killed rather than use violence in resistance I\r\n     have no reply to make; the world cannot conquer him, and fear\r\n     has no hold upon him. But even he can carry out his doctrine\r\n     only to the extent of allowing himself to be ill-treated, as I\r\n     will now convince him. Many years ago the people of Lancashire\r\n     were horrified by the facts reported in a trial for murder. In\r\n     a village on the outskirts of Bolton lived a young woman, much\r\n     liked and respected as a teacher in one of the Board-schools.\r\n     On her way home from school she was accustomed to follow a\r\n     footpath through a lonely wood, and here one evening her body\r\n     was found. She had been strangled by a ruffian who had thought\r\n     in this lonely place to have his wicked will of her. She had\r\n     resisted successfully, and he had killed her in the struggle.\r\n     Fortunately the murderer was caught, and the facts ascertained\r\n     from circumstantial evidence were confirmed by his confession.\r\n     Now the question I have to ask the man who takes his stand on\r\n     the passage quoted from the Gospel is this: \"What would have\r\n     been your duty had you been walking through that wood and came\r\n     upon the girl struggling with the man who killed her?\" This is\r\n     the crucial factor which, I submit, utterly destroys the\r\n     doctrine that the use of violence is in itself wrong. The right\r\n     or wrong is not in the employment of force, but simply in the\r\n     purpose for which it is used. What the case establishes, I\r\n     think, is that to use violence in resistance to violent wrong\r\n     is not only right, but necessary.\r\n\r\nThe above presents, very cleverly, the utterly false analogy with which\r\nwe are dealing. Professor Spenser Wilkinson's cleverness, indeed, is a\r\nlittle Machiavellian, because he approximates non-resisters of a very\r\nextreme type to those who advocate agreement among nations in the matter\r\nof armaments--a false approximation, for the proportion of those who\r\nadvocate the reduction of armaments on such grounds is so small that\r\nthey can be disregarded in this discussion. A movement which is\r\nidentified with some of the acutest minds in European affairs cannot be\r\ndisposed of by associating it with such a theory. But the basis of the\r\nfallacy is in the approximation of a State to a person. Now a State is\r\nnot a person, and is becoming less so every day, and the difficulty,\r\nwhich Professor Spenser Wilkinson indicates, is a doctrinaire\r\ndifficulty, not a real one. Professor Wilkinson would have us infer that\r\na State can be injured or killed in the same simple way in which it is\r\npossible to kill or injure a person, and that because there must be\r\nphysical force to restrain aggression upon persons, there must be\r\nphysical force to restrain aggression upon States; and because there\r\nmust be physical force to execute the judgment of a court of law in the\r\ncase of individuals, there must be physical force to execute the\r\njudgment rendered by a decision as to differences between States. All of\r\nwhich is false, and arrived at by approximating a person to a State, and\r\ndisregarding the numberless facts which render a person different from a\r\nState.\r\n\r\nHow do we know that these difficulties are doctrinaire ones? It is the\r\nBritish Empire which supplies the answer. The British Empire is made up\r\nin large part of practically independent States, and Great Britain not\r\nonly exercises no control over their acts, but has surrendered in\r\nadvance any intention of employing force concerning them.[103] The\r\nBritish States have disagreements among themselves. They may or may not\r\nrefer their differences to the British Government, but if they do, is\r\nGreat Britain going to send an army to Canada, say, to enforce her\r\njudgment? Everyone knows that that is impossible. Even when one State\r\ncommits what is in reality a serious breach of international comity on\r\nanother, not only does Great Britain refrain from using force herself,\r\nbut so far as she interferes at all, it is to prevent the employment of\r\nphysical force. For years now British Indians have been subjected to\r\nmost cruel and unjust treatment in the State of Natal.[104] The British\r\nGovernment makes no secret of the fact that she regards this treatment\r\nas unjust and cruel; were Natal a foreign State, it is conceivable that\r\nshe would employ force, but, following the principle laid down by Sir\r\nC.P. Lucas, \"whether they are right or whether they are wrong, more\r\nperhaps when they are wrong than when they are right, they cannot be\r\nmade amenable by force,\" the two States are left to adjust the\r\ndifficulty as best they may, without resort to force. In the last resort\r\nthe British Empire reposes upon the expectation that its Colonies will\r\nbehave as civilized communities, and in the long run the expectation is,\r\nof course, a well-founded one, because, if they do not so behave,\r\nretribution will come more surely by the ordinary operation of social\r\nand economic forces than it could come by any force of arms.\r\n\r\nThe case of the British Empire is not an isolated one. The fact is that\r\nmost of the States of the world maintain their relations one with\r\nanother without any possibility of a resort to force; half the States of\r\nthe world have no means of enforcing by arms such wrongs as they may\r\nsuffer at the hands of other States. Thousands of Englishmen, for\r\ninstance, make their homes in Switzerland, and it has happened that\r\nwrongs have been suffered by Englishmen at the hands of the Swiss\r\nGovernment. Would, however, the relations between the two States, or the\r\npractical standard of protection of British subjects in Switzerland, be\r\nany the better were Switzerland the whole time threatened by the might\r\nof Great Britain? Switzerland knows that she is practically free from\r\nthe possibility of the exercise of that force, but this has not\r\nprevented her from behaving as a civilized community towards British\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nWhat is the real guarantee of the good behavior of one State to another?\r\nIt is the elaborate interdependence which, not only in the economic\r\nsense, but in every sense, makes an unwarrantable aggression of one\r\nState upon another react upon the interests of the aggressor.\r\nSwitzerland has every interest in affording an absolutely secure asylum\r\nto British subjects; that fact, and not the might of the British Empire,\r\ngives protection to British subjects in Switzerland. Where, indeed, the\r\nBritish subject has to depend upon the force of his Government for\r\nprotection it is a very frail protection indeed, because in practice the\r\nuse of that force is so cumbersome, so difficult, so costly, that any\r\nother means are to be preferred to it. When the traveller in Greece had\r\nto depend upon British arms, great as was relatively the force of those\r\narms, it proved but a very frail protection. In the same way, when\r\nphysical force was used to impose on the South American and Central\r\nAmerican States the observance of their financial obligations, such\r\nefforts failed utterly and miserably--so miserably that Great Britain\r\nfinally surrendered any attempt at such enforcement. What other means\r\nhave succeeded? The bringing of those countries under the influence of\r\nthe great economic currents of our time, so that now property is\r\ninfinitely more secure in Argentina than it was when British gunboats\r\nwere bombarding her ports. More and more in international relationship\r\nis the purely economic motive--and the economic motive is only one of\r\nseveral possible ones--being employed to replace the use of physical\r\nforce. Austria, the other day, was untouched by any threat of the\r\nemployment of the Turkish army when the annexation of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina was consummated, but when the Turkish population enforced a\r\nvery successful commercial boycott of Austrian goods and Austrian ships,\r\nAustrian merchants and public opinion made it quickly plain to the\r\nAustrian Government that pressure of this nature could not be\r\ndisregarded.\r\n\r\nI anticipate the plea that while the elaborate interconnection of\r\neconomic relations renders the employment of force as between nations\r\nunnecessary in so far as their material interests are concerned, those\r\nforces cannot cover a case of aggression upon what may be termed the\r\nmoral property of nations. A critic of the first edition of this\r\nbook[105] writes:\r\n\r\n     The State is the only complete form in which human society\r\n     exists, and there are a multitude of phenomena which will be\r\n     found only as manifestations of human life in the form of a\r\n     society united by the political bond into a State. The products\r\n     of such society are law, literature, art, and science, and it\r\n     has yet to be shown that apart from that form of society known\r\n     as the State, the family or education or development of\r\n     character is possible. The State, in short, is an organism or\r\n     living thing which can be wounded and can be killed, and like\r\n     every other living thing requires protection against wounding\r\n     and destruction.... Conscience and morals are products of\r\n     social and not of individual life, and to say that the sole\r\n     purpose of the State is to make possible a decent livelihood is\r\n     as though a man should say that the sole object of human life\r\n     is to satisfy the interests of existence. A man cannot live any\r\n     kind of life without food, clothing, and shelter, but that\r\n     condition does not abolish or diminish the value of the life\r\n     industrial, the life intellectual, or the life artistic. The\r\n     State is the condition of all these lives, and its purpose is\r\n     to sustain them. That is why the State must defend itself. In\r\n     the ideal, the State represents and embodies the whole people's\r\n     conception of what is true, of what is beautiful, and of what\r\n     is right, and it is the sublime quality of human nature that\r\n     every great nation has produced citizens ready to sacrifice\r\n     themselves rather than submit to an external force attempting\r\n     to dictate to them a conception other than their own of what is\r\n     right.\r\n\r\nOne is, of course, surprised to see the foregoing in the London _Morning\r\nPost_; the concluding phrase would justify the present agitation in\r\nIndia or in Egypt or Ireland against British rule. What is that\r\nagitation but an attempt on the part of the peoples of those provinces\r\nto resist \"an external force attempting to dictate to them a conception\r\nother than their own of what is right\"? Fortunately, however, for\r\nBritish Imperialism, a people's conception of \"what is true, of what is\r\nbeautiful, and of what is right,\" and their maintenance of that\r\nconception, need not necessarily have anything whatever to do with the\r\nparticular administrative conditions under which they may live--the only\r\nthing that a conception of a \"State\" predicates. The fallacy which runs\r\nthrough the whole passage just quoted, and which makes it, in fact,\r\nnonsense, is the same fallacy which dominates the quotation that I have\r\nmade from Professor Spenser Wilkinson's book, \"Britain at Bay\"--namely,\r\nthe approximation of a State to a person, the assumption that the\r\npolitical delimitation coincides with the economic and moral\r\ndelimitation, that in short a State is the embodiment of \"the whole\r\npeople's conception of what is true, etc.\" A State is nothing of the\r\nsort. Take the British Empire. This State embodies not a homogeneous\r\nconception, but a series of often absolutely contradictory conceptions\r\nof \"what is true, etc.\"; it embodies the Mohammedan, the Buddhist, the\r\nCopt, the Catholic, the Protestant, the Pagan conceptions of right and\r\ntruth. The fact which vitiates the whole of this conception of a State\r\nis that the frontiers which define the State do not coincide with the\r\nconception of any of those things which the London _Morning Post_ critic\r\nhas enumerated; there is no such thing as British morality as opposed to\r\nFrench or German morality, or art or industry. One may, indeed, talk of\r\nan English conception of life, because that is a conception of life\r\npeculiar to England, but it would be opposed to the conception of life\r\nin other parts of the same State, in Ireland, in Scotland, in India, in\r\nEgypt, in Jamaica. And what is true of England is true of all the great\r\nmodern States. Every one of them includes conceptions absolutely opposed\r\nto other conceptions in the same State, but many of them absolutely\r\nagree with conceptions in foreign States. The British State includes, in\r\nIreland, a Catholic conception in cordial agreement with the Catholic\r\nconception in Italy, but in cordial disagreement with the Protestant\r\nconception in Scotland, or the Mohammedan conception in Bengal. The\r\nreal divisions of all those ideals, which the critic enumerates, cut\r\nright across State divisions, disregarding them entirely. Yet, again, it\r\nis only the State divisions which military conflict has in view.\r\n\r\nWhat was one of the reasons leading to the cessation of religious wars\r\nbetween States? It was that religious conceptions cut across the State\r\nfrontiers, so that the State ceased to coincide with the religious\r\ndivisions of Europe, and a condition of things was brought about in\r\nwhich a Protestant Sweden was allied with a Catholic France. This\r\nrendered the conflict absurd, and religious wars became an anachronism.\r\n\r\nIs not precisely the same thing taking place with reference to the\r\nconflicting conceptions of life which now separate men in Christendom?\r\nHave not we in America the same doctrinal struggle which is going on in\r\nFrance and Germany and Great Britain? To take one instance--social\r\nconflict. On the one side in each case are all the interests bound up\r\nwith order, authority, individual freedom, without reference to the\r\ncomfort of the weak, and on the other the reconstruction of human\r\nsociety along hitherto untried lines. These problems are for most men\r\nprobably--are certainly coming to be, if they are not now--much more\r\nprofound and fundamental than any conception which coincides with or can\r\nbe identified with State divisions. Indeed, what are the conceptions of\r\nwhich the divisions coincide with the political frontiers of the British\r\nEmpire, in view of the fact that that Empire includes nearly every race\r\nand nearly every religion under the sun? It may be said, of course, that\r\nin the case of Germany and Russia we have an autocratic conception of\r\nsocial organization as compared with a conception based on individual\r\nfreedom in England and America. Both Mr. Hyndman and Mr. Blatchford seem\r\nto take this view. \"To me,\" says the former, \"it is quite evident that\r\nif we Socialists were to achieve success we should at once be liable to\r\nattack from without by the military Powers,\" an opinion which calmly\r\noverlooks the fact that Socialism and anti-militarism have gone much\r\nfarther and are far better organized in the \"military\" States than they\r\nare in England, and that the military Governments have all their work\r\ncut out as it is to keep those tendencies in check within their own\r\nborders, without quixotically undertaking to perform the same service in\r\nother States.\r\n\r\nThis conception of the State as the political embodiment of homogeneous\r\ndoctrine is due in large part not only to the distortion produced by\r\nfalse analogy, but to the survival of a terminology which has become\r\nobsolete, and, indeed, the whole of this subject is vitiated by those\r\ntwo things. The State in ancient times was much more a personality than\r\nit is to-day, and it is mainly quite modern tendencies which have broken\r\nup its doctrinal homogeneity, and that break-up has results which are of\r\nthe very first importance in their bearing upon international pugnacity.\r\nThe matter deserves careful examination. Professor William McDougal, in\r\nhis fascinating work, \"An Introduction to Social Psychology,\" says in\r\nthe chapter on the instinct of pugnacity:\r\n\r\n     The replacement of individual by collective pugnacity is most\r\n     clearly illustrated by barbarous peoples living in small,\r\n     strongly organized communities. Within such communities\r\n     individual combat and even expressions of personal anger may be\r\n     almost completely suppressed, while the pugnacious instinct\r\n     finds itself in perpetual warfare between communities whose\r\n     relations remain subject to no law. As a rule no material\r\n     benefit is gained, and often none is sought, in these tribal\r\n     wars.... All are kept in constant fear of attack, whole\r\n     villages are often exterminated, and the population is in this\r\n     way kept down very far below the limit at which any pressure on\r\n     the means of subsistence could arise. This perpetual warfare,\r\n     like the squabbles of a roomful of quarrelsome children, seems\r\n     to be almost wholly and directly due to the uncomplicated\r\n     operation of the instinct of pugnacity. No material benefits\r\n     are sought; a few heads and sometimes a slave or two are the\r\n     only trophies gained, and if one asks an intelligent chief why\r\n     he keeps up this senseless practice, the best reason he can\r\n     give is that unless he does so his neighbors will not respect\r\n     him and his people, and will fall upon them and exterminate\r\n     them.\r\n\r\nNow, how does such hostility as that indicated in this passage differ\r\nfrom the hostility which marks international differences in our day? In\r\ncertain very evident respects. It does not suffice that the foreigner\r\nshould be merely a foreigner for us to want to kill him: there must be\r\nsome conflict of interest. The English are completely indifferent to\r\nthe Scandinavian, the Belgian, the Dutchman, the Spaniard, the Austrian,\r\nand the Italian, and are supposed for the moment to be greatly in love\r\nwith the French. The German is the enemy. But ten years ago it was the\r\nFrenchman who was the enemy, and Mr. Chamberlain was talking of an\r\nalliance with the Germans--England's natural allies, he called\r\nthem--while it was for France that he reserved his attacks.[106] It\r\ncannot be, therefore, that there is any inherent racial hostility in\r\nEnglish national character, because the Germans have not changed their\r\nnature in ten years, nor the French theirs. If to-day the French are\r\nEngland's quasi-allies and the Germans her enemies, it is simply because\r\ntheir respective interests or apparent interests have modified in the\r\nlast ten years, and their political preferences have modified with them.\r\nIn other words, national hostilities follow the exigencies of real or\r\nimagined political interests. Surely the point need not be labored,\r\nseeing that England has boxed the compass of the whole of Europe in her\r\nlikes and dislikes, and poured her hatred upon the Spaniards, the Dutch,\r\nthe Americans, the Danes, the Russians, the Germans, the French, and\r\nagain the Germans, all in turn. The phenomenon is a commonplace of\r\nindividual relationship: \"I never noticed his collars were dirty till\r\nhe got in my way,\" said someone of a rival.\r\n\r\nThe second point of difference with Professor McDougal's savage is that\r\nwhen we get to grips our conflict does not include the whole tribe; we\r\ndo not, in the Biblical fashion, exterminate men, women, children, and\r\ncattle. Enough of the old Adam remains for us to detest the women and\r\nchildren, so that an English poet could write of the \"whelps and dams of\r\nmurderous foes\"; but we no longer slaughter them.[107]\r\n\r\nBut there is a third fact which we must note--that Professor McDougal's\r\nnation was made up of a single tribe entirely homogeneous. Even the fact\r\nof living across a river was sufficient to turn another tribe into\r\nforeigners and to involve a desire to kill them. The development from\r\nthat stage to the present has involved, in addition to the two factors\r\njust enumerated, this: we now include as fellow-countrymen many who\r\nwould under the old conception necessarily be foreigners, and the\r\nprocess of our development, economic and otherwise, has made of\r\nforeigners, between whom, in Homer Lea's philosophy, there should exist\r\nthis \"primordial hostility leading inevitably to war,\" one State from\r\nwhich all conflict of interest has disappeared entirely. The modern\r\nState of France includes what were, even in historical times, eighty\r\nseparate and warring States, since each of the old Gallic cities\r\nrepresented a different State. In England people have come to regard as\r\nfellow-citizens between whom there can be no sort of conflict of\r\ninterest scores of tribes that spent their time mutually throat-cutting\r\nat no very distant period, as history goes. Anyone, particularly\r\nAmericans, can recognize, indeed, that profound national differences\r\nlike those which exist between the Welshman and the Englishman, or the\r\nScotsman and the Irishman, need involve not only no conflict of\r\ninterest, but even no separate political existence.\r\n\r\nOne has heard in recent times of the gradual revival of Nationalism, and\r\nit is commonly argued that the principle of Nationality must stand in\r\nthe way of co-operation between States. But the facts do not justify\r\nthat conclusion for a moment. The formation of States has disregarded\r\nnational divisions altogether. If conflicts are to coincide with\r\nnational divisions, Wales should co-operate with Brittany and Ireland\r\nagainst Normandy and England; Provence and Savoy with Sardinia\r\nagainst--I do not know what French province, because in the final\r\nrearrangement of European frontiers races and provinces have become so\r\ninextricably mixed, and have paid so little regard to \"natural\" and\r\n\"inherent\" divisions, that it is no longer possible to disentangle them.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning the State is a homogeneous tribe or family, and in the\r\nprocess of economic and social development these divisions so far break\r\ndown that a State may include, as the British State does, not only half\r\na dozen different races in the mother country, but a thousand different\r\nraces scattered over various parts of the earth--white, black, yellow,\r\nbrown, copper-colored. This, surely, is one of the great sweeping\r\ntendencies of history--a tendency which operates immediately any\r\ncomplicated economic life is set up. What justification have we,\r\ntherefore, for saying dogmatically that a tendency to co-operation,\r\nwhich has swept before it profound ethnic differences, social and\r\npolitical divisions, which has been constant from the dawn of men's\r\nattempts to live and labor together, is to stop at the wall of modern\r\nState divisions, which represent none of the profound divisions of the\r\nhuman race, but mainly mere administrative convenience, and embody a\r\nconception which is being every day profoundly modified?\r\n\r\nSome indication of the processes involved in this development has\r\nalready been given in the outline sketch in Chapter II. of this section,\r\nto which the reader may be referred. I have there attempted to make\r\nplain that _pari passu_ with the drift from physical force towards\r\neconomic inducement goes a corresponding diminution of pugnacity, until\r\nthe psychological factor which is the exact reverse of pugnacity comes\r\nto have more force even than the economic one. Quite apart from any\r\neconomic question, it is no longer possible for any government to order\r\nthe extermination of a whole population, of the women and children, in\r\nthe old Biblical style. In the same way, the greater economic\r\ninterdependence which improved means of communication have provoked must\r\ncarry with it a greater moral interdependence, and a tendency which has\r\nbroken down profound national divisions, like those which separated the\r\nCelt and the Saxon, will certainly break down on the psychological side\r\ndivisions which are obviously more artificial.\r\n\r\nAmong the multiple factors which have entered into the great sweeping\r\ntendency just mentioned are one or two which stand out as most likely to\r\nhave immediate effect on the breakdown of a purely psychological\r\nhostility embodied by merely State divisions. One is that lessening of\r\nthe reciprocal sentiment of collective responsibility which the complex\r\nheterogeneity of the modern State involves. What do I mean by this sense\r\nof collective responsibility? To the Chinese Boxer all Europeans are\r\n\"foreign devils\"; between Germans, English, Russians, there is little\r\ndistinction, just as to the black in Africa there is little\r\ndifferentiation between the various white races. Even the yokel in\r\nEngland talks of \"them foreigners.\" If a Chinese Boxer is injured by a\r\nFrenchman, he kills a German, and feels himself avenged--they are all\r\n\"foreign devils.\" When an African tribe suffers from the depredations\r\nof a Belgian trader, the next white man who comes into its territory,\r\nwhether he happens to be an Englishman or a Frenchman, loses his life;\r\nthe tribesmen also feel themselves avenged. But if the Chinese Boxer had\r\nour clear conception of the different European nations, he would feel no\r\npsychological satisfaction in killing a German because a Frenchman had\r\ninjured him. There must be in the Boxer's mind some collective\r\nresponsibility as between the two Europeans, or in the negro's mind\r\nbetween the two white men, in order to obtain this psychological\r\nsatisfaction. If that collective responsibility does not exist, the\r\nhostility to the second white man, in each case, is not even raised.\r\n\r\nNow, our international hostilities are largely based on the notion of a\r\ncollective responsibility in each of the various States against which\r\nour hostility is directed, which does not, in fact, exist. There is at\r\nthe present moment great ill-feeling in England against \"the German.\"\r\nNow, \"the German\" is a non-existent abstraction. Englishmen are angry\r\nwith the German because he is building warships, conceivably directed\r\nagainst them; but a great many Germans are as much opposed to that\r\nincrease of armament as are the English, and the desire of the yokel to\r\n\"have a go at them Germans\" depends absolutely upon a confusion just as\r\ngreat as--indeed, greater than--that which exists in the mind of the\r\nBoxer, who cannot differentiate between the various European peoples.\r\nMr. Blatchford commenced that series of articles which has done so much\r\nto accentuate this ill-feeling with this phrase:\r\n\r\n     Germany is deliberately preparing to destroy the British Empire;\r\n\r\nand later in the articles he added:\r\n\r\n     Britain is disunited; Germany is homogeneous. We are\r\n     quarrelling about the Lords' Veto, Home Rule, and a dozen other\r\n     questions of domestic politics. We have a Little Navy Party, an\r\n     Anti-Militarist Party; Germany is unanimous upon the question\r\n     of naval expansion.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to pack a more dangerous untruth into so few\r\nlines. What are the facts? If \"Germany\" means the bulk of the German\r\npeople, Mr. Blatchford is perfectly aware that he is not telling the\r\ntruth. It is not true to say of the bulk of the German people that they\r\nare deliberately preparing to destroy the British Empire. The bulk of\r\nthe German people, if they are represented by any one party at all, are\r\nrepresented by the Social Democrats, who have stood from the first\r\nresolutely against any such intention. Now the facts have to be\r\nmisstated in this way in order to produce that temper which makes for\r\nwar. If the facts are correctly stated, no such temper arises.\r\n\r\nWhat has a particularly competent German to say to Mr. Blatchford's\r\ngeneralization? Mr. Fried, the editor of _Die Friedenswarte_, writes:\r\n\r\n     There is no one German people, no single Germany.... There are\r\n     more abrupt contrasts between Germans and Germans than between\r\n     Germans and Indians. Nay, the contradistinctions within Germany\r\n     are greater than those between Germans and the units of any\r\n     other foreign nation whatever. It might be possible to make\r\n     efforts to promote good understanding between Germans and\r\n     Englishmen, between Germans and Frenchmen, to organize visits\r\n     between nation and nation; but it will be forever impossible to\r\n     set on foot any such efforts at an understanding between German\r\n     Social Democrats and Prussian Junkers, between German\r\n     Anti-Semites and German Jews.[108]\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of most international hostility depends upon nothing\r\nmore intricate than the realization of facts which are little more\r\ncomplex than the geographical knowledge which enables us to see that the\r\nanger of the yokel is absurd when he pummels a Frenchman because an\r\nItalian has swindled him.\r\n\r\nIt may be argued that there never has existed in the past this\r\nidentification between a people and the acts of its Government which\r\nrendered the hatred of one country for another logical, yet that hatred\r\nhas arisen. That is true; but certain new factors have entered recently\r\nto modify this problem. One is that never in the history of the world\r\nhave nations been so complex as they are to-day; and the second is that\r\nnever before have the dominating interests of mankind so completely cut\r\nacross State divisions as they do to-day. The third factor is that never\r\nbefore has it been possible, as it is possible by our means of\r\ncommunication to-day, to offset a solidarity of classes and ideas\r\nagainst a presumed State solidarity.\r\n\r\nNever at any stage of the world's development has there existed, as\r\nexists to-day, the machinery for embodying these interests and class\r\nideas and ideals which cut across frontiers. It is not generally\r\nunderstood how many of our activities have become international. Two\r\ngreat forces have become internationalized: Capital on the one hand,\r\nLabor and Socialism on the other.\r\n\r\nThe Labor and Socialist movements have always been international, and\r\nbecome more so every year. Few considerable strikes take place in any\r\none country without the labor organizations of other countries\r\nfurnishing help, and very large sums have been contributed by the labor\r\norganizations of various countries in this way.\r\n\r\nWith reference to capital, it may almost be said that it is organized so\r\nnaturally internationally that formal organization is not necessary.\r\nWhen the Bank of England is in danger, it is the Bank of France which\r\ncomes automatically to its aid, even in a time of acute political\r\nhostility. It has been my good fortune in the last ten years to discuss\r\nthese matters with financiers on one side and labor leaders on the\r\nother, and I have always been particularly struck by the fact that I\r\nhave found in these two classes precisely the same attitude of\r\ninternationalization. In no department of human activity is\r\ninternationalization so complete as in finance. The capitalist has no\r\ncountry, and he knows, if he be of the modern type, that arms and\r\nconquests and jugglery with frontiers serve no ends of his, and may very\r\nwell defeat them. But employers, as apart from capitalists, are also\r\ndeveloping a strong international cohesive organization. Among the\r\nBerlin despatches in the London _Times_ of April 18, 1910, I find the\r\nfollowing concerning a big strike in the building trade, in which nearly\r\na quarter of a million men went out. Quoting a writer in the _North\r\nGerman Gazette_, the correspondent says:\r\n\r\n     The writer lays stress upon the efficiency of the employers'\r\n     arrangements. He says, in particular, that it will probably be\r\n     possible to extend the lock-out to industries associated with\r\n     the building industry, especially the cement industry, and that\r\n     the employers are completing a ring of cartel treaties, which\r\n     will prevent German workmen from finding employment in\r\n     neighboring countries, and will insure for German employers all\r\n     possible support from abroad. It is said that Switzerland and\r\n     Austria were to conclude treaties yesterday on the same\r\n     conditions as Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Holland, and France, and\r\n     that Belgium and Italy would come in, so that there will be\r\n     complete co-operation on the part of all Germany's neighbors\r\n     except Russia. In the circumstances the men's organs rather\r\n     overlabor the point when they produce elaborate evidence of\r\n     premeditation. The _Vorwaerts_ proves that the employers have\r\n     long been preparing for \"a trial of strength,\" but that is\r\n     admitted. The official organ of the employers says, in so many\r\n     words, that any intervention is useless until \"the forces have\r\n     been measured in open battle.\"\r\n\r\nHave not these forces begun already to affect the psychological domain\r\nwith which we are now especially dealing? Do we place national vanity,\r\nfor instance, on the same plane as individual vanity? Have we not\r\nalready realized the absurdity involved?\r\n\r\nI have quoted Admiral Mahan as follows:\r\n\r\n     That extension of national authority over alien communities,\r\n     which is the dominant note in the world politics of to-day,\r\n     dignifies and enlarges each State and each citizen that enters\r\n     its fold.... Sentiment, imagination, aspiration, the\r\n     satisfaction of the rational and moral faculties in some object\r\n     better than bread alone, all must find a part in a worthy\r\n     motive. Like individuals, nations and empires have souls as\r\n     well as bodies. Great and beneficent achievement ministers to\r\n     worthier contentment than the filling of the pocket.\r\n\r\nWhatever we may think of the individuals who work disinterestedly for\r\nthe benefit of backward and alien peoples, and however their lives may\r\nbe \"dignified and enlarged\" by their activities, it is surely absurd to\r\nsuppose that other individuals, who take no part in their work and who\r\nremain thousands of miles from the scene of action, can possibly be\r\ncredited with \"great and beneficent achievement.\"\r\n\r\nA man who boasts of his possessions is not a very pleasant or admirable\r\ntype, but at least his possessions are for his own use and do bring a\r\ntangible satisfaction, materially as well as sentimentally. His is the\r\nobject of a certain social deference by reason of his wealth--a\r\ndeference which has not a very high motive, if you will, but the outward\r\nand visible signs of which are pleasing to a vain man. But is the same\r\nin any sense true, despite Admiral Mahan, of the individual of a big\r\nState as compared to the individual of a small one? Does anyone think of\r\npaying deference to the Russian _mujik_ because he happens to belong to\r\none of the biggest empires territorially? Does anyone think of despising\r\nan Ibsen or a Bjoernsen, or any educated Scandinavian or Belgian or\r\nHollander, because they happen to belong to the smallest nations in\r\nEurope? The thing is absurd, and the notion is simply due to\r\ninattention. Just as we commonly overlook the fact that the individual\r\ncitizen is quite unaffected materially by the extent of his nation's\r\nterritory, that the material position of the individual Dutchman as a\r\ncitizen of a small State will not be improved by the mere fact of the\r\nabsorption of his State by the German Empire, in which case he will\r\nbecome the citizen of a great nation, so in the same way his moral\r\nposition remains unchanged; and the notion that an individual Russian is\r\n\"dignified and enlarged\" each time that Russia conquers some new Asiatic\r\noutpost, or Russifies a State like Finland, or that the Norwegian would\r\nbe \"dignified\" were his State conquered by Russia and he became a\r\nRussian, is, of course, sheer sentimental fustian of a very mischievous\r\norder. This is the more emphasized when we remember that the best men of\r\nRussia are looking forward wistfully, not to the enlargement, but to the\r\ndissolution, of the unwieldy giant--\"stupid with the stupidity of\r\ngiants, ferocious with their ferocity\"--and the rise in its stead of a\r\nmultiplicity of self-contained, self-knowing communities, \"whose members\r\nwill be united together by organic and vital sympathies, and not by\r\ntheir common submission to a common policeman.\"\r\n\r\nHow small and thin a pretence is all the talk of national prestige when\r\nthe matter is tested by its relation to the individual is shown by the\r\ncommonplaces of our everyday social intercourse. In social consideration\r\neverything else takes precedence of nationality, even in those circles\r\nwhere Chauvinism is a cult. British Royalty is so impressed with the\r\ndignity which attaches to membership of the British Empire that its\r\nPrinces will marry into the royal houses of the smallest and meanest\r\nStates in Europe, while they would regard marriage with a British\r\ncommoner as an unheard-of _mesalliance_. This standard of social\r\njudgment so marks all the European royalties that at the present time\r\nnot one ruler in Europe belongs, properly speaking, to the race which he\r\nrules. In all social associations an analogous rule is followed. In our\r\n\"selectest\" circles an Italian, Rumanian, Portuguese, or even Turkish\r\nnoble, is received where an American tradesman would be taboo.\r\n\r\nThis tendency has struck almost all authorities who have investigated\r\nscientifically modern international relations. Thus Mr. T. Baty, the\r\nwell-known authority on international law, writes as follows:\r\n\r\n     All over the world society is organizing itself by strata. The\r\n     English merchant goes on business to Warsaw, Hamburg, or\r\n     Leghorn; he finds in the merchants of Italy, Germany, and\r\n     Russia the ideas, the standard of living, the sympathies, and\r\n     the aversions which are familiar to him at home. Printing and\r\n     the locomotive have enormously reduced the importance of\r\n     locality. It is the mental atmosphere of its fellows, and not\r\n     of its neighborhood, which the child of the younger generation\r\n     is beginning to breathe. Whether he reads the _Revue des Deux\r\n     Mondes_ or _Tit-Bits_, the modern citizen is becoming at once\r\n     cosmopolitan and class-centred. Let the process work for a few\r\n     more years; we shall see the common interests of cosmopolitan\r\n     classes revealing themselves as far more potent factors than\r\n     the shadowy common interests of the subjects of States. The\r\n     Argentine merchant and the British capitalist alike regard the\r\n     Trade Union as a possible enemy--whether British or Argentine\r\n     matters to them less than nothing. The Hamburg docker and his\r\n     brother of London do not put national interests before the\r\n     primary claims of caste. International class feeling is a\r\n     reality, and not even a nebulous reality; the nebula has\r\n     developed centres of condensation. Only the other day Sir W.\r\n     Runciman, who is certainly not a Conservative, presided over a\r\n     meeting at which there were laid the foundations of an\r\n     International Shipping Union, which is intended to unite\r\n     ship-owners of whatever country in a common organization. When\r\n     it is once recognized that the real interests of modern people\r\n     are not national, but social, the results may be\r\n     surprising.[109]\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Baty points out, this tendency, which he calls \"stratification,\"\r\nextends to all classes:\r\n\r\n     It is impossible to ignore the significance of the\r\n     International Congresses, not only of Socialism, but of\r\n     pacificism, of esperantism, of feminism, of every kind of art\r\n     and science, that so conspicuously set their seal upon the\r\n     holiday season. Nationality as a limiting force is breaking\r\n     down before cosmopolitanism. In directing its forces into an\r\n     international channel, Socialism will have no difficulty\r\n     whatever[110].... We are, therefore, confronted with a coming\r\n     condition of affairs in which the force of nationality will be\r\n     distinctly inferior to the force of class-cohesion, and in\r\n     which classes will be internationally organized so as to wield\r\n     their force with effect. The prospect induces some curious\r\n     reflections.\r\n\r\nWe have here, at present in merely embryonic form, a group of motives\r\notherwise opposed, but meeting and agreeing upon one point: the\r\norganization of society on other than territorial and national\r\ndivisions. When motives of such breadth as these give force to a\r\ntendency, it may be said that the very stars in their courses are\r\nworking to the same end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nTHE PRACTICAL OUTCOME\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE RELATION OF DEFENCE TO AGGRESSION\r\n\r\n    Necessity for defence arises from the existence of a motive for\r\n    attack--Platitudes that everyone overlooks--To attenuate the motive\r\n    for aggression is to undertake a work of defence.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general proposition embodied in this book--that the world has passed\r\nout of that stage of development in which it is possible for one\r\ncivilized group to advance its well-being by the military domination of\r\nanother--is either broadly true or broadly false. If it is false, it\r\ncan, of course, have no bearing upon the actual problems of our time,\r\nand can have no practical outcome; huge armaments tempered by warfare\r\nare the logical and natural condition.\r\n\r\nBut the commonest criticism this book has had to meet is that, though\r\nits central proposition is in essence sound, it has, nevertheless, no\r\npractical value, because--\r\n\r\n     1. Armaments are for defence, not for aggression.\r\n\r\n     2. However true these principles may be, the world does not\r\n     recognize them and never will, because men are not guided by\r\n     reason.\r\n\r\nAs to the first point. It is probable that, if we really understood\r\ntruths which we are apt to dismiss as platitudes, many of our problems\r\nwould disappear.\r\n\r\nTo say, \"We must take measures for defence\" is equivalent to saying,\r\n\"Someone is likely to attack us,\" which is equivalent to saying,\r\n\"Someone has a motive for attacking us.\" In other words, the basic fact\r\nfrom which arises the necessity for armaments, the ultimate explanation\r\nof European militarism, is _the force of the motive making for\r\naggression_. (And in the word \"aggression,\" of course, I include the\r\nimposition of superior force by the _threat_, or implied threat, of its\r\nuse, as well as by its actual use.)\r\n\r\nThat motive may be material or moral; it may arise from real conflict of\r\ninterest, or a purely imaginary one; but with the disappearance of\r\nprospective aggression disappears also the need for defence.\r\n\r\nThe reader deems these platitudes beside the mark?\r\n\r\nI will take a few sample criticisms directed at this book. Here is the\r\nLondon _Daily Mail_:\r\n\r\n     The bigger nations are armed, not so much because they look for\r\n     the spoils of war, as because they wish to prevent the horrors\r\n     of it; arms are for defence.[111]\r\n\r\nAnd here is the London _Times_:\r\n\r\n     No doubt the victor suffers, but who suffers most, he or the\r\n     vanquished?\"[112]\r\n\r\nThe criticism of the _Daily Mail_ was made within three months of a\r\n\"raging and tearing\" big navy campaign, all of it based on the\r\nassumption that Germany _was_ \"looking for the spoils of war,\" the\r\nEnglish naval increase being thus a direct outcome of such motives.\r\nWithout it, the question of English increase would not have arisen.[113]\r\nThe only justification for the clamor for increase was that England was\r\nliable to _attack_; every nation in Europe justifies its armaments in\r\nthe same way; every nation consequently believes in the universal\r\nexistence of this motive for attack.\r\n\r\nThe _Times_ has been hardly less insistent than the _Mail_ as to the\r\ndanger from German aggression; but its criticism would imply that the\r\nmotive behind that prospective aggression is not a desire for any\r\npolitical advantage or gain of any sort. Germany apparently recognizes\r\naggression to be, not merely barren of any useful result whatsoever, but\r\nburdensome and costly into the bargain; she is, nevertheless, determined\r\nto enter upon it in order that though she suffer, someone else will\r\nsuffer more![114]\r\n\r\nIn common with the London _Daily Mail_ and the London _Times_, Admiral\r\nMahan fails to understand this \"platitude,\" which underlies the relation\r\nof defence to aggression.\r\n\r\nThus in his criticism of this book, he cites the position of Great\r\nBritain during the Napoleonic era as proof that commercial advantage\r\ngoes with the possession of preponderant military power in the following\r\npassage:\r\n\r\n     Great Britain owed her commercial superiority then to the armed\r\n     control of the sea, which had sheltered her commerce and\r\n     industrial fabric from molestation by the enemy.\r\n\r\n_Ergo_, military force has commercial value, a result which is arrived\r\nat by this method: in deciding a case made up of two parties you ignore\r\none.\r\n\r\nEngland's superiority was not due to the employment of military force,\r\nbut to the fact that she was able to prevent the employment of military\r\nforce against her; and the necessity for so doing arose from Napoleon's\r\nmotive in threatening her. But for the existence of this motive to\r\naggression--moral or material, just or mistaken--Great Britain, without\r\nany force whatsoever, would have been more secure and more prosperous\r\nthan she was; she would not have been spending a third of her income in\r\nwar, and her peasantry would not have been starving.\r\n\r\nOf a like character to the remark of the _Times_ is the criticism of the\r\n_Spectator_, as follows:\r\n\r\n     Mr. Angell's main point is that the advantages customarily\r\n     associated with national independence and security have no\r\n     existence outside the popular imagination.... He holds that\r\n     Englishmen would be equally happy if they were under German\r\n     rule, and that Germans would be equally happy if they were\r\n     under English rule. It is irrational, therefore, to take any\r\n     measures for perpetuating the existing European order, since\r\n     only a sentimentalist can set any value on its maintenance....\r\n     Probably in private life Mr. Angell is less consistent and less\r\n     inclined to preach the burglar's gospel that to the wise man\r\n     _meum_ and _tuum_ are but two names for the same thing. If he\r\n     is anxious to make converts, he will do well to apply his\r\n     reasoning to subjects that come nearer home, and convince the\r\n     average man that marriage and private property are as much\r\n     illusions as patriotism. If sentiment is to be banished from\r\n     politics, it cannot reasonably be retained in morals.\r\n\r\nAs the reply to this somewhat extraordinary criticism is directly\r\ngermane to what it is important to make clear, I may, perhaps, be\r\nexcused for reproducing my letter to the _Spectator_, which was in part\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     How far the foregoing is a correct description of the scope and\r\n     character of the book under review may be gathered from the\r\n     following statement of fact. My pamphlet does _not_ attack the\r\n     sentiment of patriotism (unless a criticism of the duellist's\r\n     conception of dignity be considered as such); it simply does\r\n     not deal with it, as being outside the limits of the main\r\n     thesis. I do _not_ hold, and there is not one line to which\r\n     your reviewer can point as justifying such a conclusion, that\r\n     Englishmen would be equally happy if they were under German\r\n     rule. I do not conclude that it is irrational to take measures\r\n     for perpetuating the existing European order. I do _not_\r\n     \"expose the folly of self-defence in nations.\" I do _not_\r\n     object to spending money on armaments at this juncture. On the\r\n     contrary, I am particularly emphatic in declaring that while\r\n     the present philosophy is what it is, we are bound to maintain\r\n     our relative position with other Powers. I admit that so long\r\n     as there is danger, as I believe there is, from German\r\n     aggression, we must arm. I do _not_ preach a burglar's gospel,\r\n     that _meum_ and _tuum_ are the same thing, and the whole\r\n     tendency of my book is the exact reverse: it is to show that\r\n     the burglar's gospel--which is the gospel of statecraft as it\r\n     now stands--is no longer possible among nations, and that the\r\n     difference between _meum_ and _tuum_ must necessarily, as\r\n     society gains in complication, be given a stricter observance\r\n     than it has ever heretofore been given in history. I do _not_\r\n     urge that sentiment should be banished from politics, if by\r\n     sentiment is meant the common morality that guides us in our\r\n     treatment of marriage and of private property. The whole tone\r\n     of my book is to urge with all possible emphasis the exact\r\n     reverse of such a doctrine; to urge that the morality which has\r\n     been by our necessities developed in the society of individuals\r\n     must also be applied to the society of nations as that society\r\n     becomes by virtue of our development more interdependent.\r\n\r\n     I have only taken a small portion of your reviewer's article\r\n     (which runs to a whole page), and I do not think I am\r\n     exaggerating when I say that nearly all of it is as untrue and\r\n     as much a distortion of what I really say as the passage from\r\n     which I have quoted. What I do attempt to make plain is that\r\n     the necessity for defence measures (which I completely\r\n     recognize and emphatically counsel) implies on the part of\r\n     someone a motive for aggression, and that the motive arises\r\n     from the (at present) universal belief in the social and\r\n     economic advantages accruing from successful conquest.\r\n\r\n     I challenged this universal axiom of statecraft and attempted\r\n     to show that the mechanical development of the last thirty or\r\n     forty years, especially in the means of communication, had\r\n     given rise to certain economic phenomena--of which re-acting\r\n     bourses and the financial interdependence of the great economic\r\n     centres of the world are perhaps the most characteristic--which\r\n     render modern wealth and trade intangible in the sense that\r\n     they cannot be seized or interfered with to the advantage of a\r\n     military aggressor, the moral being, not that self-defence is\r\n     out of date, but that aggression is, and that when aggression\r\n     ceases, self-defence will be no longer necessary. I urged,\r\n     therefore, that in these little-recognized truths might\r\n     possibly be found a way out of the armament _impasse_; that if\r\n     the accepted motive for aggression could be shown to have no\r\n     solid basis, the tension in Europe would be immensely relieved,\r\n     and the risk of attack become immeasurably less by reason of\r\n     the slackening of the motive for aggression. I asked whether\r\n     this series of economic facts--so little realized by the\r\n     average politician in Europe, and yet so familiar to at least a\r\n     few of the ablest financiers--did not go far to change the\r\n     axioms of statecraft, and I urged re-consideration of such in\r\n     the light of these facts.\r\n\r\n     Your reviewer, instead of dealing with the questions thus\r\n     raised, accuses me of \"attacking patriotism,\" of arguing that\r\n     \"Englishmen would be equally happy under German rule,\" and much\r\n     nonsense of the same sort, for which there is not a shadow of\r\n     justification. Is this serious criticism? Is it worthy of the\r\n     _Spectator_?\r\n\r\nTo the foregoing letter the _Spectator_ critic rejoins as follows:\r\n\r\n     If Mr. Angell's book had given me the same impression as that\r\n     which I gain from his letter, I should have reviewed it in a\r\n     different spirit. I can only plead that I wrote under the\r\n     impression which the book actually made on me. In reply to his\r\n     \"statement of fact,\" I must ask your leave to make the\r\n     following corrections: (1) Instead of saying that, on Mr.\r\n     Angell's showing, Englishmen would be \"equally happy\" under\r\n     German rule, I ought to have said that they would be equally\r\n     well off. But on his doctrine that material well-being is \"the\r\n     very highest\" aim of a politician, the two terms seem to be\r\n     interchangeable. (2) The \"existing European order\" rests on the\r\n     supposed economic value of political force. In opposition to\r\n     this Mr. Angell maintains \"the economic futility of political\r\n     force.\" To take measures for perpetuating an order founded on a\r\n     futility does seem to me \"irrational.\" (3) I never said that\r\n     Mr. Angell objects to spending money on armaments \"while the\r\n     present philosophy is what it is.\" (4) The stress laid in the\r\n     book on the economic folly of patriotism, as commonly\r\n     understood, does seem to me to suggest that \"sentiment should\r\n     be banished from politics.\" But I admit that this was only an\r\n     inference, though, as I still think, a fair inference. (5) I\r\n     apologize for the words \"the burglar's gospel.\" They have the\r\n     fault, incident to rhetorical phrases, of being more telling\r\n     than exact.\r\n\r\nThis rejoinder, as a matter of fact, still reveals the confusion which\r\nprompted the first criticism. Because I urged that Germany could do\r\nEngland relatively little harm, since the harm which she inflicted would\r\nimmediately react on German prosperity, my critic assumes that this is\r\nequivalent to saying that Englishmen would be as happy or as prosperous\r\nunder German rule. He quite overlooks the fact that if Germans are\r\nconvinced that they will obtain no benefit by the conquest of the\r\nEnglish they will not attempt that conquest, and there will be no\r\nquestion of the English living under German rule either less or more\r\nhappily or prosperously. It is not a question of Englishmen saying, \"Let\r\nthe German come,\" but of the German saying, \"Why should we go?\" As to\r\nthe critic's second point, I have expressly explained that not the\r\nrival's real interest but what he deems to be his real interest must be\r\nthe guide to conduct. Military force is certainly economically futile,\r\nbut so long as German policy rests on the assumption of the supposed\r\neconomic value of military force, England must meet that force by the\r\nonly force that can reply to it.\r\n\r\nSome years ago the bank in a Western mining town was frequently\r\nsubjected to \"hold-ups,\" because it was known that the great mining\r\ncompany owning the town kept large quantities of gold there for the\r\npayment of its workmen. The company, therefore, took to paying its\r\nwages mainly by check on a San Francisco bank, and by a simple system of\r\nclearances practically abolished the use of gold in considerable\r\nquantities in the mining town in question. The bank was never attacked\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nNow, the demonstration that gold had been replaced by books in that bank\r\nwas as much a work of defence as though the bank had spent tens of\r\nthousands of dollars in constructing forts and earthworks, and mounting\r\nGatling guns around the town. Of the two methods of defence, that of\r\nsubstituting checks for gold was infinitely cheaper, and more effective.\r\n\r\nEven if the inferences which the _Spectator_ reviewer draws were true\r\nones, which for the most part they are not, he still overlooks one\r\nimportant element. If it were true that the book involves the \"folly of\r\npatriotism,\" how is that in any way relevant to the discussion, since I\r\nalso urge that nations are justified in protecting even their follies\r\nagainst the attack of other nations? I may regard the Christian\r\nScientists, or the Seventh Day Adventists, or the Spiritualists, as very\r\nfoolish people, and to some extent mischievous people; but were an Act\r\nof Parliament introduced for their suppression by physical force, I\r\nshould resist such an act with all the energy of which I was capable. In\r\nwhat way are the two attitudes contradictory? They are the attitudes, I\r\ntake it, of educated men the world over. The fact has no importance, and\r\nit hardly bears on this subject, but I regard certain English\r\nconceptions of life bearing on matters of law, and social habit, and\r\npolitical philosophy, as infinitely preferable to the German, and if I\r\nthought that such conceptions demanded defence indefinitely by great\r\narmaments this book would never have been written. But I take the view\r\nthat the idea of such necessity is based on a complete illusion, not\r\nonly because as a matter of present-day fact, and even in the present\r\nstate of political philosophy, Germany has not the least intention of\r\ngoing to war with us to change our notions in law or literature, art or\r\nsocial organization, but also because if she had any such notion it\r\nwould be founded upon illusions which she would be bound sooner or later\r\nto shed, because German policy could not indefinitely resist the\r\ninfluence of a general European attitude on such matters any more than\r\nit has been possible for any great and active European State to stand\r\noutside the European movement which has condemned the policy of\r\nattempting to impose religious belief by the physical force of the\r\nState. And I should regard it as an essential part of the work of\r\ndefence to aid in the firm establishment of such a European doctrine, as\r\nmuch a part of the work of defence as it would be to go on building\r\nbattleships until Germany had subscribed to it.\r\n\r\nA great part of the misconception just dealt with arises from a hazily\r\nconceived fear that ideas like those embodied in this book must\r\nattenuate our energy of defence, and that we shall be in a weaker\r\nposition relatively to our rivals than we were before. But this\r\noverlooks the fact that if the progress of ideas weakens our energies\r\nof defence, it also weakens our rival's energy of attack, and the\r\nstrength of our relative positions is just what it was originally, with\r\nthis exception: that we have taken a step towards peace instead of a\r\nstep towards war, to which the mere piling up of armaments, unchecked by\r\nany other factor, must in the end inevitably lead.\r\n\r\nBut there is one aspect of this failure to realize the relation of\r\ndefence to aggression, which brings us nearer to considering the bearing\r\nof these principles upon the question of practical policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nARMAMENT, BUT NOT ALONE ARMAMENT\r\n\r\n    Not the facts, but men's belief about facts, shapes their\r\n    conduct--Solving a problem of two factors by ignoring one--The\r\n    fatal outcome of such a method--The German Navy as a \"luxury\"--If\r\n    both sides concentrate on armament alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Not the facts, but men's opinions about the facts, are what matter,\"\r\none thinker has remarked. And this is because men's conduct is\r\ndetermined, not necessarily by the right conclusion from facts, but the\r\nconclusion they believe to be right.\r\n\r\nWhen men burned witches, their conduct was exactly what it would have\r\nbeen if what they believed to be true _had_ been true. The truth made no\r\ndifference to their behavior, so long as they could not see the truth.\r\nAnd so in politics. As long as Europe is dominated by the old beliefs,\r\nthose beliefs will have virtually the same effect in politics as though\r\nthey were intrinsically sound.\r\n\r\nAnd just as in the matter of burning witches a change of behavior was\r\nthe outcome of a change of opinion, in its turn the result of a more\r\nscientific investigation of the facts, so in the same way a change in\r\nthe political conduct of Europe can only come about as the result of a\r\nchange of thought; and that change of thought will not come about so\r\nlong as the energies of men in this matter are centred only upon\r\nperfecting instruments of warfare. It is not merely that better ideas\r\ncan only result from more attention being given to the real meaning of\r\nfacts, but that the direct tendency of war preparation--with the\r\nsuspicion it necessarily engenders and the ill-temper to which it almost\r\nalways gives rise--is to create both mechanical and psychological checks\r\nto improvement of opinion and understanding. Here, for instance, is\r\nGeneral von Bernhardi, who has just published his book in favor of war\r\nas the regenerator of nations, urging that Germany should attack certain\r\nof her enemies before they are ready to attack her. Suppose the others\r\nreply by increasing their military force? It suits Bernhardi entirely.\r\nFor what is the effect of this increase on the minds of Germans possibly\r\ndisposed to disagree with Bernhardi? It is to silence them and to\r\nstrengthen Bernhardi's hands. His policy, originally wrong, has become\r\nrelatively right, because his arguments have been answered by force. For\r\nthe silence of his might-be critics will still further encourage those\r\nof other nations who deem themselves threatened by this kind of opinion\r\nin Germany to increase their armaments; and these increases will still\r\nfurther tend to strengthen Bernhardi's school, and still further silence\r\nhis critics. The process by which force tends to crush reason is,\r\nunhappily, cumulative and progressive. The vicious circle can only be\r\nbroken by the introduction somewhere of the factor of reason.\r\n\r\nAnd this is precisely, my critics urge, why we need do nothing but\r\nconcentrate on the instruments of force!\r\n\r\nThe all but invariable attitude adopted by the man in the street in this\r\nwhole discussion is about as follows:\r\n\r\n\"What, as practical men, we have to do, is to be stronger than our\r\nenemy; the rest is theory, and does not matter.\"\r\n\r\nWell, the inevitable outcome of such an attitude is catastrophe. It\r\nleads us not toward, but away from, solution.\r\n\r\nIn the first edition of this book I wrote:\r\n\r\n     Are we immediately to cease preparation for war, since our\r\n     defeat cannot advantage our enemy nor do us in the long run\r\n     much harm? No such conclusion results from a study of the\r\n     considerations elaborated here. It is evident that so long as\r\n     the misconception we are dealing with is all but universal in\r\n     Europe, so long as the nations believe that in some way the\r\n     military and political subjugation of others will bring with it\r\n     a tangible material advantage to the conqueror, we all do, in\r\n     fact, stand in danger from such aggression. Not his interest,\r\n     but what he deems to be his interest, will furnish the real\r\n     motive of our prospective enemy's action. And as the illusion\r\n     with which we are dealing does, indeed, dominate all those\r\n     minds most active in European politics, we (in England) must,\r\n     while this remains the case, regard an aggression, even such as\r\n     that which Mr. Harrison foresees, as within the bounds of\r\n     practical politics. (What is not within the bounds of\r\n     possibility is the extent of devastation which he foresees as\r\n     the result of such attack, which, I think, the foregoing pages\r\n     sufficiently demonstrate.)\r\n\r\n     On this ground alone I deem that England, or any other nation,\r\n     is justified in taking means of self-defence to prevent such\r\n     aggression. This is not, therefore, a plea for disarmament\r\n     irrespective of the action of other nations. So long as current\r\n     political philosophy in Europe remains what it is, I would not\r\n     urge the reduction of the British war budget by a single\r\n     sovereign.\r\n\r\nI see no reason to alter a word of this. But if preparation of the\r\nmachinery of war is to be the only form of energy in this matter--if\r\nnational effort is to neglect all other factors whatsoever--more and\r\nmore will sincere and patriotic men have doubts as to whether they are\r\njustified in co-operating in further piling up the armaments of any\r\ncountry. Of the two risks involved--the risk of attack arising from a\r\npossible superiority of armament on the part of a rival, and the risk of\r\ndrifting into conflict because, concentrating all our energies on the\r\nmere instrument of combat, we have taken no adequate trouble to\r\nunderstand the facts of this case--it is at least an arguable\r\nproposition that the second risk is the greater. And I am prompted to\r\nthis expression of opinion without surrendering one iota of a lifelong\r\nand passionate belief that a nation attacked should defend itself to the\r\nlast penny and to the last man.\r\n\r\nIn this matter it seems fatally easy to secure either one of two kinds\r\nof action: that of the \"practical man\" who limits his energies to\r\nsecuring a policy which will perfect the machinery of war and disregard\r\nanything else; or that of the Pacifist, who, persuaded of the brutality\r\nor immorality of war, is apt to deprecate effort directed at\r\nself-defence. What is needed is the type of activity which will include\r\nboth halves of the problem: provision for education, for a Political\r\nReformation in this matter, _as well as_ such means of defence as will\r\nmeantime counterbalance the existing impulse to aggression. To\r\nconcentrate on either half to the exclusion of the other half is to\r\nrender the whole problem insoluble.\r\n\r\nWhat must inevitably happen if the nations take the line of the\r\n\"practical man,\" and limit their energies simply and purely to piling up\r\narmaments?\r\n\r\nA British critic once put to me what he evidently deemed a poser: \"Do\r\nyou urge that we shall be stronger than our enemy, or weaker?\"\r\n\r\nTo which I replied: \"The last time that question was asked me was in\r\nBerlin, by Germans. What would you have had me reply to those\r\nGermans?\"--a reply which, of course, meant this: In attempting to find\r\nthe solution of this question in terms of one party, you are attempting\r\nthe impossible. The outcome will be war, and war would not settle it. It\r\nwould all have to be begun over again.\r\n\r\nThe British Navy League catechism says: \"Defence consists in being so\r\nstrong that it will be dangerous for your enemy to attack you.\"[115] Mr.\r\nChurchill, even, goes farther than the Navy League, and says: \"The way\r\nto make war impossible is to make victory certain.\"\r\n\r\nThe Navy League definition is at least possible of application to\r\npractical politics, because rough equality of the two parties would make\r\nattack by either dangerous. Mr. Churchill's principle is impossible of\r\napplication to practical politics, because it could only be applied by\r\none party, and would, in the terms of the Navy League principle, deprive\r\nthe other party of the right of defence. As a matter of simple fact,\r\nboth the British Navy League, by its demand for two ships to one, and\r\nMr. Churchill, by his demand for certain victory, deny in this matter\r\nGermany's right to defend herself; and such denial is bound, on the part\r\nof a people animated by like motives to themselves, to provoke a\r\nchallenge. When the British Navy League says, as it does, that a\r\nself-respecting nation should not depend upon the goodwill of foreigners\r\nfor its safety, but upon its own strength, it recommends Germany to\r\nmaintain her efforts to arrive at some sort of equality with England.\r\nWhen Mr. Churchill goes farther, and says that a nation is entitled to\r\nbe so strong as to make victory over its rivals certain, he knows that\r\nif Germany were to adopt his own doctrine, its certain outcome would be\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of such an objection, Mr. Churchill says that\r\npreponderant power at sea is a luxury to Germany, a necessity to\r\nBritain; that these efforts of Germany are, as it were, a mere whim in\r\nno way dictated by the real necessities of her people, and having\r\nbehind them no impulse wrapped up with national needs.[116]\r\n\r\nIf that be the truth, then it is the strongest argument imaginable for\r\nthe settlement of this Anglo-German rivalry by agreement: by bringing\r\nabout that Political Reformation of Europe which it is the object of\r\nthese pages to urge.\r\n\r\nHere are those of the school of Mr. Churchill who say: The danger of\r\naggression from Germany is so great that England must have an enormous\r\npreponderance of force--two to one; so great are the risks Germany is\r\nprepared to take, that unless victory on the English side is certain she\r\nwill attack. And yet, explain this same school, the impulse which\r\ncreates these immense burdens and involves these immense risks is a mere\r\nwhim, a luxury; the whole thing is dissociated from any real national\r\nneed.\r\n\r\nIf that really be the case, then, indeed, is it time for a campaign of\r\nEducation in Europe; time that the sixty-five millions, more or less, of\r\nhard-working and not very rich people, whose money support alone makes\r\nthis rivalry possible, learned what it is all about. This \"whim\" has\r\ncost the two nations, in the last ten years, a sum larger than the\r\nindemnity France paid to Germany. Does Mr. Churchill suppose that these\r\nmillions know, or think, this struggle one for a mere luxury, or whim?\r\nAnd if they did know, would it be quite a simple matter for the German\r\nGovernment to keep up the game?\r\n\r\nBut those who, during the last decade in England, have in and out of\r\nseason carried on this active campaign for the increase of British\r\narmaments, do _not_ believe that Germany's action is the result of a\r\nmere whim. They, being part of the public opinion of Europe, subscribe\r\nto the general European doctrine that Germany is pushed to do these\r\nthings by real national necessities, by her need for expansion, for\r\nfinding food and livelihood for all these increasing millions. And if\r\nthis is so, the English are asking Germany, in surrendering this\r\ncontest, to betray future German generations--wilfully to withhold from\r\nthem those fields which the strength and fortitude of this generation\r\nmight win. If this common doctrine is true, the English are asking\r\nGermany to commit national suicide.[117]\r\n\r\nWhy should it be assumed that Germany will do it? That she will be less\r\npersistent in protecting her national interest, her posterity, be less\r\nfaithful than the British themselves to great national impulses? Has not\r\nthe day gone by when educated men can calmly assume that any Englishman\r\nis worth three foreigners? And yet such an assumption, ignorant and\r\nprovincial as we are bound to admit it to be, is the only one that can\r\npossibly justify this policy of concentrating upon armament alone.\r\n\r\nEven Admiral Fisher can write:\r\n\r\n     The supremacy of the British Navy is the best security for the\r\n     peace of the world.... If you rub it in, both at home and\r\n     abroad, that you are ready for instant war, with every unit of\r\n     your strength in the first line and waiting to be first in, and\r\n     hit your enemy in the belly and kick him when he is down, and\r\n     boil your prisoners in oil (if you take any), and torture his\r\n     women and children, then people will keep clear of you.\r\n\r\nWould Admiral Fisher refrain from taking a given line merely because,\r\nif he took it, someone would \"hit him in the belly,\" etc.? He would\r\nrepudiate the idea with the utmost scorn, and probably reply that the\r\nthreat would give him an added incentive to take the line in question.\r\nBut why should Admiral Fisher suppose that he has a monopoly of courage,\r\nand that a German Admiral would act otherwise than he? Is it not about\r\ntime that each nation abandoned the somewhat childish assumption that it\r\nhas a monopoly of the courage and the persistence in the world, and that\r\nthings which would never frighten or deter it will frighten and deter\r\nits rivals?\r\n\r\nYet in this matter the English assume either that the Germans will be\r\nless persistent than they, or that in this contest their backs will\r\nbreak first. A coadjutor of Lord Roberts is calmly talking of a Naval\r\nBudget of 400 or 500 million dollars, and universal service as well, as\r\na possibility of the all but immediate future.[118] If England can stand\r\nthat now, why should not Germany, who is, we are told, growing\r\nindustrially more rapidly than the English, be able to stand as much?\r\nBut when she has arrived at that point, the English, at the same rate,\r\nmust have a naval budget of anything from 750 to 1000 million dollars, a\r\ntotal armament budget of something in the region of 1250 millions. The\r\nlonger it goes on, the worse will be England's relative position,\r\nbecause she has imposed on herself a progressive handicap.\r\n\r\nThe end can only be conflict, and already the policy of precipitating\r\nthat conflict is raising its head.\r\n\r\nSir Edmund C. Cox writes in the premier English review, the _Nineteenth\r\nCentury_, for April, 1910:\r\n\r\n     Is there no alternative to this endless yet futile competition\r\n     in shipbuilding? Yes, there is. It is one which a Cromwell, a\r\n     William Pitt, a Palmerston, a Disraeli, would have adopted long\r\n     ago. This is that alternative--the only possible conclusion. It\r\n     is to say to Germany: \"All that you have been doing constitutes\r\n     a series of unfriendly acts. Your fair words go for nothing.\r\n     Once for all, you must put an end to your warlike preparations.\r\n     If we are not satisfied that you do so, we shall forthwith sink\r\n     every battleship and cruiser which you possess. The situation\r\n     which you have created is intolerable. If you determine to\r\n     fight us, if you insist upon war, war you shall have; but the\r\n     time shall be of our choosing and not of yours, and that time\r\n     shall be now.\" And that is where the present policy, the sheer\r\n     bulldog piling up of armaments without reference to or effort\r\n     towards a better political doctrine in Europe, inevitably\r\n     leads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nIS THE POLITICAL REFORMATION POSSIBLE?\r\n\r\n    Men are little disposed to listen to reason, \"therefore we\r\n    should not talk reason\"--Are men's ideas immutable?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen, therefore--\r\n\r\n     1. That the need for defence arises from the existence of a\r\n     motive for attack.\r\n\r\n     2. That that motive is, consequently, part of the problem of\r\n     defence.\r\n\r\n     3. That, since as between the advanced peoples we are dealing\r\n     with in this matter, one party is as able in the long run to\r\n     pile up armaments as the other, we cannot get nearer to\r\n     solution by armaments alone; we must get at the original\r\n     provoking cause--the motive making for aggression.\r\n\r\n     4. That if that motive results from a true judgment of the\r\n     facts; if the determining factor in a nation's well-being and\r\n     progress is really its power to obtain by force advantage over\r\n     others, the present situation of armament rivalry tempered by\r\n     war is a natural and inevitable one.\r\n\r\n     5. That if, however, the view is a false one, our progress\r\n     towards solution will be marked by the extent to which the\r\n     error becomes generally recognized in international public\r\n     opinion.\r\n\r\nThat brings me to the last entrenchment of those who actively or\r\npassively oppose propaganda looking towards reform in this matter.\r\n\r\nAs already pointed out, the last year or two has revealed a suggestive\r\nshifting of position on the part of such opposition. The original\r\nposition of the defenders of the old political creeds was that the\r\neconomic thesis here outlined was just simply wrong; then, that the\r\nprinciples themselves were sound enough, but that they were irrelevant,\r\nbecause not interests, but ideals, constituted the cause of conflict\r\nbetween nations. In reply to which, of course, came the query, What\r\nideals, apart from questions of interest, lie at the bottom of the\r\nconflict which is the most typical of our time--what ideal motive is\r\nGermany, for instance, pursuing in its presumed aggression upon England?\r\nConsequently that position has generally been abandoned. Then we were\r\ntold that men don't act by logic, but passion. Then the critics were\r\nasked how they explained the general character of _la haute politique_,\r\nits cold intrigues and expediency, the extraordinary rapid changes in\r\nalliances and _ententes_, all following exactly a line of passionless\r\ninterest reasoned, though from false premises, with very great logic\r\nindeed; and were asked whether all experience does not show that, while\r\npassion may determine the energy with which a given line of conduct is\r\npursued, the direction of that line of conduct is determined by\r\nprocesses of another kind: John, seeing James, his life-long and\r\nlong-sought enemy, in the distance, has his hatred passionately stirred,\r\nand harbors thoughts of murder. As he comes near he sees that it is not\r\nJames at all, but a quiet and inoffensive neighbor, Peter. John's\r\nthoughts of murder are appeased, not because he has changed his nature,\r\nbut because the recognition of a simple fact has changed the direction\r\nof his passion. What we in this matter hope to do is to show that the\r\nnations are mistaking Peter for James.\r\n\r\nWell, the last entrenchment of those who oppose the work is the dogmatic\r\nassertion that though we are right as to the material fact, its\r\ndemonstration can never be made; that this political reformation of\r\nEurope the political rationalists talk about is a hopeless matter; it\r\nimplies a change of opinion so vast that it can only be looked for as\r\nthe result of whole generations of educative processes.\r\n\r\nSuppose this were true. What then? Will you leave everything severely\r\nalone, and leave wrong and dangerous ideas in undisturbed possession of\r\nthe political field?\r\n\r\nThis conclusion is not a policy; it is Oriental fatalism--\"Kismet,\" \"the\r\nwill of Allah.\"\r\n\r\nSuch an attitude is not possible among men dominated by the traditions\r\nand the impulses of the Western world. We do not let things slide in\r\nthis way; we do not assume that as men are not guided by reason in\r\npolitics, therefore we shall not reason about politics. The time of\r\nstatesmen is absorbed in the discussion of these things. Our press and\r\nliterature are deeply concerned in them. The talk and thought of men are\r\nabout them. However little they may deem reason to affect the conduct of\r\nmen, they go on reasoning. And progress in conduct is determined by the\r\ndegree of understanding which results.\r\n\r\nIt is true that physical conflict marks the point at which the reason\r\nhas failed; men fight when they have not been able to \"come to an\r\nunderstanding\" in the common phrase, which is for once correct. But is\r\nthis a cause for deprecating the importance of clear understanding? Is\r\nit not, on the contrary, precisely why our energies should be devoted to\r\nimproving our capacity for dealing with these things by reason, rather\r\nthan by physical force?\r\n\r\nDo we not inevitably arrive at the destination to which every road in\r\nthis discussion leads? However we may start, with whatever plan, however\r\nelaborated or varied, the end is always the same--the progress of man in\r\nthis matter depends upon the degree to which his ideas are just; man\r\nadvances by the victories of his mind and character. Again we have\r\narrived at the region of platitude. But also again it is one of those\r\nplatitudes which most people deny. Thus the London _Spectator_:\r\n\r\n     For ourselves, as far as the main economic proposition goes, he\r\n     preaches to the converted.... If nations were perfectly wise\r\n     and held perfectly sound economic theories, they would\r\n     recognize that exchange is the union of forces, and that it is\r\n     very foolish to hate or be jealous of your co-operators.... Men\r\n     are savage, bloodthirsty creatures ... and when their blood is\r\n     up will fight for a word or a sign, or, as Mr. Angell would put\r\n     it, for an illusion.\r\n\r\nCriticism at the other end of the journalistic scale--that, for\r\ninstance, from Mr. Blatchford--is of an exactly similar character. Mr.\r\nBlatchford says:\r\n\r\n     Mr. Angell may be right in his contention that modern war is\r\n     unprofitable to both belligerents. I do not believe it, but he\r\n     may be right. But he is wrong if he imagines that his theory\r\n     will prevent European war. To prevent European wars it needs\r\n     more than the truth of his theory: it needs that the war lords\r\n     and diplomatists and financiers and workers of Europe shall\r\n     believe the theory.... So long as the rulers of nations believe\r\n     that war may be expedient (see Clausewitz), and so long as they\r\n     believe they have the power, war will continue.... It will\r\n     continue until these men are fully convinced that it will bring\r\n     no advantage.\r\n\r\nTherefore, argues Mr. Blatchford, the demonstration that war will not\r\nbring advantage is futile.\r\n\r\nI am not here, for the purpose of controversy, putting an imaginary\r\nconclusion into Mr. Blatchford's mouth. It is the conclusion that he\r\nactually does draw. The article from which I have quoted was intended to\r\ndemonstrate the futility of books like this. It was by way of reply to\r\nan early edition of this one. In common with the other critics, he must\r\nhave known that this is not a plea for the impossibility of war (I have\r\nalways urged with emphasis that our ignorance on this matter makes war\r\nnot only possible, but extremely likely), but for its futility. And the\r\ndemonstration of its futility is, I am now told, in itself futile!\r\n\r\nI have expanded the arguments of this and others of my critics thus:\r\n\r\n    The war lords and diplomats are still wedded to the old\r\n        false theories; _therefore_ we shall leave those\r\n        theories undisturbed, and generally deprecate discussion\r\n        of them.\r\n\r\n    Nations do not realize the facts; _therefore_ we should\r\n        attach no importance to the work of making them known.\r\n\r\n    These facts profoundly affect the well-being of European\r\n        peoples; _therefore_ we shall not systematically\r\n        encourage the efficient study of them.\r\n\r\n    If they were generally known, the practical outcome would be\r\n        that most of our difficulties herein would disappear;\r\n        _therefore_ anyone who attempts to make them known is an\r\n        amiable sentimentalist, a theorist, and so on, and so on.\r\n\r\n    \"Things do not matter so much as people's opinions about\r\n        things\"[119]; _therefore_ no effort shall be directed to\r\n        a modification of opinion.\r\n\r\n    The only way for these truths to affect policy, to become\r\n        operative in the conduct of nations, is to make them\r\n        operative in the minds of men; _therefore_ discussion of\r\n        them is futile.\r\n\r\n    Our troubles arise from the wrong ideas of nations;\r\n        _therefore_ ideas do not count--they are \"theories.\"\r\n\r\n    General conception and insight in this matter is vague and\r\n        ill-defined, so that action is always in danger of being\r\n        decided by sheer passion and irrationalism; _therefore_\r\n        we shall do nothing to render insight clear and\r\n        well-defined.\r\n\r\n    The empire of sheer impulse, of the non-rational, is\r\n        strongest when associated with ignorance (_e.g._,\r\n        Mohammedan fanaticism, Chinese Boxerism), and only yields\r\n        to the general progress of ideas (_e.g._, sounder\r\n        religious notions sweeping away the hate and horrors of\r\n        religious persecution); _therefore_ the best way to\r\n        maintain peace is to pay no attention to the progress of\r\n        political ideas.\r\n\r\n    The progress of ideas has completely transformed religious\r\n        feeling in so far as it settles the policy of one\r\n        religious group in relation to another; _therefore_ the\r\n        progress of ideas will never transform patriotic feeling,\r\n        which settles the policy of one political group in\r\n        relation to another.\r\n\r\nWhat, in short, does the argument of my critics amount to? This: that so\r\nslow, so stupid is the world that, though the facts may be\r\nunassailable, they will never be learned within any period that need\r\nconcern us.\r\n\r\nWithout in the least desiring to score off my critics, and still less to\r\nbe discourteous, I sometimes wonder it has never struck them that in the\r\neyes of the profane this attitude of theirs must appear really as a most\r\ncolossal vanity. \"We\" who write in newspapers and reviews understand\r\nthese things; \"we\" can be guided by reason and wisdom, but the common\r\nclay will not see these truths for \"thousands of years.\" I talk to the\r\nconverted (so I am told) when my book is read by the editors and\r\nreviewers. _They_, of course, can understand; but the notion that mere\r\ndiplomats and statesmen, the men who make up Governments and nations,\r\nshould ever do so is, of course, quite too preposterous.\r\n\r\nPersonally, however flattering this notion might be, I have never been\r\nable to feel its soundness. I have always strongly felt the precise\r\nopposite--namely, that what is plain to me will very soon be equally\r\nplain to my neighbor. Possessing, presumably, as much vanity as most, I\r\nam, nevertheless, absolutely convinced that simple facts which stare an\r\nordinary busy man of affairs in the face are not going to be for ever\r\nhid from the multitude. Depend upon it, if \"we\" can see these things, so\r\ncan the mere statesmen and diplomats and those who do the work of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if what \"we\" write in reviews and books does not touch men's\r\nreasons, does not affect their conduct, why do we write at all?\r\n\r\nWe do _not_ believe it impossible to change or form men's ideas; such a\r\nplea would doom us all to silence, and would kill religious and\r\npolitical literature. \"Public Opinion\" is not external to men; it is\r\nmade by men; by what they hear and read and have suggested to them by\r\ntheir daily tasks, and talk and contact.\r\n\r\nIf it _were_ true, therefore, that the difficulties in the way of\r\nmodifying political opinion were as vast as my critics would have us\r\nbelieve, that would not affect our conduct; the more they emphasize\r\nthose difficulties, the more they emphasize the need for effort on our\r\npart.\r\n\r\nBut it is not true that a change such as that involved here necessarily\r\n\"takes thousands of years.\" I have already dealt with the plea, but\r\nwould recall only one incident that I have cited: a scene painted by a\r\nSpanish artist of the Court and nobles and populace in a great European\r\ncity, gathered on a public holiday as for a festival to see a beautiful\r\nchild burned to death for a faith that, as it plaintively said, it had\r\nsucked in with its mother's milk.\r\n\r\nHow long separates us from that scene? Why, not the lives of three\r\nordinarily elderly people. And how long after that scene--which was not\r\nan isolated incident of uncommon kind, but a very everyday matter,\r\ntypical of the ideas and feelings of the time at which it was\r\nenacted--was it before the renewal of such became a practical\r\nimpossibility? It was not a hundred years. It was enacted in 1680, and\r\nwithin the space of a short lifetime the world knew that never again\r\nwould a child be burned alive as the result of a legal condemnation by a\r\nduly constituted Court, and as a public festival, witnessed by the King\r\nand the nobles and the populace, in one of the great cities of Europe.\r\n\r\nOr, do those who talk of \"unchanging human nature\" and \"thousands of\r\nyears\" really plead that we are in danger of a repetition of such a\r\nscene? In that case our religious toleration is a mistake. Protestants\r\nstand in danger of such tortures, and should arm themselves with the old\r\narmory of religious combat--the rack, the thumbscrew, the iron maiden,\r\nand the rest--as a matter of sheer protection.\r\n\r\n\"Men are savage, bloodthirsty creatures, and will fight for a word or a\r\nsign,\" the _Spectator_ tells us, when their patriotism is involved.\r\nWell, until yesterday, it was as true to say that of them when their\r\nreligion was involved. Patriotism is the religion of politics. And as\r\none of the greatest historians of religious ideas has pointed out,\r\nreligion and patriotism are the chief moral influences moving great\r\nbodies of men, and \"the separate modifications and mutual interaction of\r\nthese two agents may almost be said to constitute the moral history of\r\nmankind.\"[120]\r\n\r\nBut is it likely that a general progress which has transformed religion\r\nis going to leave patriotism unaffected; that the rationalization and\r\nhumanization which have taken place in the more complex domain of\r\nreligious doctrine and belief will not also take place in the domain of\r\npolitics? The problem of religious toleration was beset with\r\ndifficulties incalculably greater than any which confront us in this\r\nproblem. Then, as now, the old order was defended with real\r\ndisinterestedness; then it was called religious fervor; now it is called\r\npatriotism. The best of the old inquisitors were as disinterested, as\r\nsincere, as single-minded, as are doubtless the best of the Prussian\r\nJunkers, the French Nationalists, the English militarists. Then, as now,\r\nthe progress towards peace and security seemed to them a dangerous\r\ndegeneration, the break-up of faiths, the undermining of most that holds\r\nsociety together. Then, as now, the old order pinned its faith to the\r\ntangible and visible instruments of protection--I mean the instruments\r\nof physical force. And the Catholic, in protecting himself by the\r\nInquisition against what he regarded as the dangerous intrigues of the\r\nProtestant, was protecting what he regarded not merely as his own social\r\nand political security, but the eternal salvation, he believed, of\r\nunborn millions of men. Yet he surrendered such instruments of defence,\r\nand finally Catholic and Protestant alike came to see that the peace and\r\nsecurity of both were far better assured by this intangible thing--the\r\nright thinking of men--than by all the mechanical ingenuity of prisons\r\nand tortures and burnings which it was possible to devise. In like\r\nmanner will the patriot come finally to see that better than\r\n_Dreadnoughts_ will be the recognition on his part and on the part of\r\nhis prospective enemy, that there is no interest, material or moral, in\r\nconquest and military domination.\r\n\r\nAnd that hundred years which I have mentioned as representing an\r\napparently impassable gulf in the progress of European ideas, a period\r\nwhich marked an evolution so great that the very mind and nature of men\r\nseemed to change, was a hundred years without newspapers--a time in\r\nwhich books were such a rarity that it took a generation for one to\r\ntravel from Madrid to London; in which the steam printing-press did not\r\nexist, nor the railroad, nor the telegraph, nor any of those thousand\r\ncontrivances which now make it possible for the words of an American\r\nstatesman spoken to-day to be read by the millions of Europe to-morrow\r\nmorning--to do, in short, more in the way of the dissemination of ideas\r\nin ten months than was possible then in a century.\r\n\r\nWhen things moved so slowly, a generation or two sufficed to transform\r\nthe mind of Europe on the religious side. Why should it be impossible to\r\nchange that mind on the political side in a generation, or half a\r\ngeneration, when things move so much more quickly? Are men less disposed\r\nto change their political than their religious opinions? We all know\r\nthat _not_ to be the case. In every country in Europe we find political\r\nparties advocating, or at least acquiescing in, policies which they\r\nstrenuously opposed ten years ago. Does the evidence available go to\r\nshow that the particular side of politics with which we are dealing is\r\nnotably more impervious to change and development than the rest--less\r\nwithin the reach and influence of new ideas?\r\n\r\nI must risk here the reproach of egotism and bad taste to call attention\r\nto a fact which bears more directly on that point, perhaps, than any\r\nother that could be cited.\r\n\r\nIt is some fifteen years since it first struck me that certain economic\r\nfacts of our civilization--facts of such visible and mechanical nature\r\nas reacting bourses and bank rate-movements, in all the economic\r\ncapitals of the world, and so on--would soon force upon the attention of\r\nmen a principle which, though existing for long past in some degree in\r\nhuman affairs, had not become operative to any extent. Was there any\r\ndoubt as to the reality of the material facts involved? Circumstances of\r\nmy occupation happily furnished opportunities of discussing the matter\r\nthoroughly with bankers and statesmen of world-wide authority. There was\r\nno doubt on that score. Had we yet arrived at the point at which it was\r\npossible to make the matter plain to general opinion? Were politicians\r\ntoo ill-educated on the real facts of the world, too much absorbed in\r\nthe rough-and-tumble of workaday politics to change old ideas? Were\r\nthey, and the rank and file, still too enslaved by the hypnotism of an\r\nobsolete terminology to accept a new view? One could only put it to a\r\npractical test. A brief exposition of the cardinal principles was\r\nembodied in a brief pamphlet and published obscurely without\r\nadvertisement, and bearing, necessarily, an unknown name. The result\r\nwas, under the circumstances, startling, and certainly did not justify\r\nin the least the plea that there exists universal hostility to the\r\nadvance of political rationalism. Encouragement came from most\r\nunlooked-for quarters: public men whose interests have been mainly\r\nmilitary, alleged Jingoes, and even from soldiers. The more considerable\r\nedition has appeared in English, German, French, Dutch, Danish, Swedish,\r\nSpanish, Italian, Russian, Japanese, Erdu, Persian, and Hindustani, and\r\nnowhere has the Press completely ignored the book. Papers of Liberal\r\ntendencies have welcomed it everywhere. Those of more reactionary\r\ntendencies have been much less hostile than one could have\r\nexpected.[121]\r\n\r\nDoes such an experience justify that universal rebelliousness to\r\npolitical rationalism on which my critics for the most part found their\r\ncase? My object in calling attention to it is evident. If this is\r\npossible as the result of the effort of a single obscure person working\r\nwithout means and without leisure, what could not be accomplished by an\r\norganization adequately equipped and financed? Mr. Augustine Birrell\r\nsays somewhere: \"Some opinions, bold and erect as they may still stand,\r\nare in reality but empty shells. One shove would be fatal. Why is it not\r\ngiven?\"\r\n\r\nIf little apparently has been done in the modification of ideas in this\r\nmatter, it is because little relatively has been attempted. Millions of\r\nus are prepared to throw ourselves with energy into that part of\r\nnational defence which, after all, is a makeshift, into agitation for\r\nthe building of _Dreadnoughts_ and the raising of armies, the things in\r\nfact which can be seen, where barely dozens will throw themselves with\r\nequal ardor into that other department of national defence, the only\r\ndepartment which will really guarantee security, but by means which are\r\ninvisible--the rationalization of ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\n    Relative failure of Hague Conferences and the cause--Public opinion\r\n    the necessary motive force of national action--That opinion only\r\n    stable if informed--\"Friendship\" between nations and its\r\n    limitations--America's role in the coming \"Political Reformation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch of the pessimism as to the possibility of any progress in this\r\nmatter is based on the failure of such efforts as Hague Conferences.\r\nNever has the contest of armament been so keen as when Europe began to\r\nindulge in Peace Conferences. Speaking roughly and generally, the era of\r\ngreat armament expansion dates from the first Hague Conference.\r\n\r\nWell, the reader who has appreciated the emphasis laid in the preceding\r\npages on working through the reform of ideas will not feel much\r\nastonishment at the failure of efforts such as these. The Hague\r\nConferences represented an attempt not to work through the reform of\r\nideas, but to modify by mechanical means the political machinery of\r\nEurope, without reference to the ideas which had brought it into\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nArbitration treaties, Hague Conferences, International Federation\r\ninvolve a new conception of relationship between nations. But the\r\nideals--political, economical, and social--on which the old conceptions\r\nare based, our terminology, our political literature, our old habits of\r\nthought, diplomatic inertia, which all combine to perpetuate the old\r\nnotions, have been left serenely undisturbed. And surprise is expressed\r\nthat such schemes do not succeed.\r\n\r\nFrench politics have given us this proverb, \"I am the leader, therefore\r\nI follow.\" This is not mere cynicism, but expresses in reality a\r\nprofound truth. What is a leader or a ruler in a modern parliamentary\r\nsense? He is a man who holds office by virtue of the fact that he\r\nrepresents the mean of opinion in his party. Initiative, therefore,\r\ncannot come from him until he can be sure of the support of his\r\nparty--that is, until the initiative in question represents the common\r\nopinion of his party. The author happened to discuss the views embodied\r\nin this book with a French parliamentary chief, who said in effect: \"Of\r\ncourse you are talking to the converted, but I am helpless. Suppose that\r\nI attempted to embody these views before they were ready for acceptance\r\nby my party. I should simply lose my leadership in favor of a man less\r\nopen to new ideas, and the prospect of their acceptance would not be\r\nincreased, but diminished. Even if I were not already converted, it\r\nwould be no good trying to convert me. Convert the body of the party and\r\nits leaders will not need conversion.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this is the position of every civilized government, parliamentary or\r\nnot. The struggle for religious freedom was not gained by agreements\r\ndrawn up between Catholic States and Protestant States, or even between\r\nCatholic bodies and Protestant bodies. No such process was possible, for\r\nin the last resort there was no such thing as an absolutely Catholic\r\nState or an absolutely Protestant one. Our security from persecution is\r\ndue simply to the general recognition of the futility of the employment\r\nof physical force in a matter of religious belief. Our progress towards\r\npolitical rationalism will take place in like manner.\r\n\r\nThere is no royal road of this kind to a better state. It seems decreed\r\nthat we shall not permanently achieve improvement which we as\r\nindividuals have not paid for in the coin of hard thinking.\r\n\r\nNothing is easier to achieve in international politics than academic\r\ndeclarations in favor of Peace. But governments being trustees have a\r\nfirst duty in the interests of their wards, or what they conceive to be\r\nsuch interests, and they disregard what is still looked upon as a\r\nconception having its origin in altruistic and self-sacrificing motives.\r\n\"Self-sacrifice\" is the last motive governments can allow themselves to\r\nconsider. They are created to protect, not to sacrifice, the interests\r\nof which they are placed in charge.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for governments to base their normal policies on\r\nconceptions which are in advance of the general standard of the\r\npolitical opinion of the people from whom they derive their power. The\r\naverage man will, it is true, quite readily subscribe abstractly to a\r\npeace ideal, just as he will subscribe abstractly to certain religious\r\nideals--to take no thought for the morrow, not to save up treasure upon\r\nearth--without the faintest notion of making them a guide of conduct,\r\nor, indeed, of seeing how they _can_ be a guide of conduct. At peace\r\nmeetings he will cheer lustily and sign petitions, because he believes\r\nPeace to be a great moral idea, and that armies, like the Police, are\r\ndestined to disappear one day--on about the same day in his belief--when\r\nthe nature of man shall have been altered.\r\n\r\nOne may be able fully to appreciate this attitude of the \"average\r\nsensual man\" without doubting the least in the world the sincerity,\r\ngenuineness, wholeheartedness of these emotional movements in favor of\r\npeace, which from time to time sweep over a country (as on the occasion\r\nof the Taft-Grey exchange of views on arbitration). But what it is\r\nnecessary to emphasize, what cannot be too often reiterated, is that\r\nthese movements, however emotional and sincere, are not movements which\r\ncan lead to breaking up the intellectual basis of the policy which\r\nproduces armaments in the Western World. These movements embrace only\r\none section of the factors making for peace--the moral and the\r\nemotional. And while those factors have immense power, they are\r\nuncertain and erratic in their operation, and when the shouting dies and\r\nthere is a natural reaction from emotion, and it is a question once more\r\nof doing the humdrum week-day work of the world, of pushing our\r\ninterests, of finding markets, of achieving the best possible generally\r\nfor our nation as against other nations, of preparing for the future, of\r\norganizing one's efforts, the old code of compromise between the ideal\r\nand the necessary will be as operative as ever. So long as his notions\r\nof what war can accomplish in an economic or commercial sense remain\r\nwhat they are, the average man will not deem that his prospective enemy\r\nis likely to make the peace ideal a guide of conduct. Incidentally he\r\nwould be right. At the bottom of his mind--and I say this not lightly\r\nand as a guess, but as an absolute conviction after very close\r\nobservation--the ideal of peace is conceived as a demand that he weaken\r\nhis own defences on no better assurance than that his prospective rival\r\nor enemy will be well-behaved and not wicked enough to attack him.\r\n\r\nIt appeals to him as about equivalent to asking that he shall not lock\r\nhis doors because to suppose people will rob him is to have a low view\r\nof human nature!\r\n\r\nThough he believes his own position in the world (as a colonial Power,\r\netc.) to be the result of the use of force by himself, of his readiness\r\nto seize what could be seized, he is asked to believe that foreigners\r\nwill not do in the future what he himself has done in the past. He finds\r\nthis difficult to swallow.\r\n\r\nSave in his Sunday moods, the whole thing makes him angry. It appeals to\r\nhim as \"unfair,\" in that he is asked by his own countrymen to do\r\nsomething that they apparently do not ask of foreigners; it appears to\r\nhim as unmanly, in that he is asked to surrender the advantage which his\r\nstrength has secured him in favor of a somewhat emasculate ideal.\r\n\r\nThe patriot feels that his moral intention is every bit as sincere as\r\nthat of the pacifist--that, indeed, patriotism is a finer moral ideal\r\nthan pacifism. The difference between the pacifist and the advocate of\r\n_real-politik_ is an intellectual and not a moral one at all, and the\r\nassumption of superior morality which the former sometimes makes does\r\nthe cause which he has at heart infinite harm. Until the pacifist can\r\nshow that the employment of military force fails to secure material\r\nadvantage, the common man will, in ordinary times, continue to believe\r\nthat the militarist has a moral sanction as great as that underlying\r\npacifism.\r\n\r\nIt may seem gratuitously ungracious to suggest that the very elevation\r\nwhich has marked peace propaganda in the past should have been the very\r\nthing that has sometimes stood in the way of its success. But such a\r\nphenomenon is not new in human development. There was as much good\r\nintention in the world of religious warfare and oppression as there is\r\nin ours. Indeed, the very earnestness of the men who burnt, tortured,\r\nand imprisoned and stamped out human thought with the very best motives,\r\nwas precisely the factor which stood in the way of improvement.\r\n\r\nImprovement came finally, not from better intention, but from an acuter\r\nuse of the intelligence of men, from hard mental work.\r\n\r\nSo long as we assume that high motive, a better moral tone is all that\r\nis needed in international relations, and that an understanding of these\r\nproblems will in some wonderful way come of itself, without hard and\r\nsystematic intellectual effort, we shall make little headway.\r\n\r\nGood feeling and kindliness and a ready emotion are among the most\r\nprecious things in life, but they are qualities possessed by some of the\r\nmost retrograde nations in the world, because in them they are not\r\ncoupled with the homely quality of hard work, in which one may include\r\nhard thinking. This last is the real price of progress, and we shall\r\nmake none of worth unless we pay it.\r\n\r\nA word or two as to the role of \"friendship\" in international relations.\r\nCourtesy and a certain measure of good faith are essential elements\r\nwherever civilized men come in direct contact; without them organized\r\nsociety would go to pieces. But these invaluable elements never yet of\r\nthemselves settled real differences; they merely render the other\r\nfactors of adjustment possible. Why should one expect courtesy and\r\ngood-fellowship to settle grave political differences between English\r\nand Germans when they altogether fail to settle such differences between\r\nEnglish and English? What should we say of a statesman professing to be\r\nserious who suggested that all would be well between President Wilson\r\nand the lobbyists concerning the tariff, between the Democrats and\r\nRepublicans on protection, between the millionaire and the day laborer\r\non the question of the income tax, and a thousand and one other\r\nthings--that all these knotty problems would disappear, if only the\r\nrespective protagonists could be persuaded to take lunch together? Is it\r\nnot a little childish?\r\n\r\nYet I am bound to admit that a whole school of persons who deal with\r\ninternational problems would have us believe that all international\r\ndifferences would disappear if only we could have enough junketings,\r\ndinner-parties, exchange visits of clergymen, and what not. These things\r\nhave immense use in so far as they facilitate discussion and the\r\nelucidation of the policy in which the rivalry has its birth, and to\r\nthat extent only. But if they are not vehicles of intellectual\r\ncomprehension, if the parties go away with as little understanding of\r\nthe factors and nature of international relationship as they had before\r\nsuch meetings took place, they have served no purpose whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe work of the world does not get done merely by being good friends\r\nwith everybody; the problems of international diplomacy are not to be\r\nsolved merely by a sort of international picnic; that would make the\r\nworld too easy a place to live in.\r\n\r\nHowever ungracious it may seem, it is nevertheless dangerous to allow to\r\ngo unchallenged the notion that the cultivation of \"friendship and\r\naffection\" between nations, irrespective of the other factors affecting\r\ntheir relationship, can ever seriously modify international politics.\r\nThe matter is of grave importance, because so much good effort is spent\r\nin putting the cart before the horse, and attempting to create an\r\noperative factor out of a sentiment that can never be constant and\r\npositive one way or the other, since it must in the nature of things be\r\nlargely artificial. It is a psychological impossibility in any ordinary\r\nworkaday circumstances to have any special feeling of affection for a\r\nhundred or sixty or forty millions of people, composed of infinitely\r\ndiverse elements, good, bad, and indifferent, noble and mean, pleasing\r\nand unpleasing, whom, moreover, we have never seen and never shall see.\r\nIt is too large an order. We might as well be asked to entertain\r\nfeelings of affection for the Tropic of Capricorn. As I have already\r\nhinted, we have no particular affection for the great mass of our own\r\ncountrymen--your lobbyist enthusiast for Mr. Wilson, your railroad\r\nstriker for the employer of labor, your Suffragette for your\r\nanti-Suffragette, and so on _ad infinitum_. Patriotism has nothing to do\r\nwith it. The patriot is often the person who had the heartiest\r\ndetestation for a large mass of his fellow-countrymen. Consider any\r\nanti-administration literature. As an English instance a glance at Mr.\r\nLeo Maxse's monthly masterpieces of epithet-making, or at what the\r\npan-Germans have to say of their own Empire and Government (\"poltroons\r\nin the pay of the English\" is a choice tit-bit I select from one German\r\nnewspaper), will soon convince one.\r\n\r\nWhy, therefore, should we be asked to entertain for foreigners a\r\nsentiment we do not give to our own people? And not only to entertain\r\nthat sentiment, but to make (always in the terms of the present\r\npolitical beliefs) great sacrifices on behalf of it!\r\n\r\nNeed it be said that I have not the least desire to deprecate sincere\r\nemotion as a factor in progress? Emotion and enthusiasm form the divine\r\nstimulus without which no great things would be achieved; but emotion\r\ndivorced from mental and moral discipline is not the kind on which wise\r\nmen will place a very high value. Some of the intensest emotion of the\r\nworld has been given to some of the worst possible objects. Just as in\r\nthe physical world, the same forces--steam, gunpowder, what you\r\nwill--which, controlled and directed may do an infinitely useful\r\nwork--may, uncontrolled, cause accidents and catastrophes of the gravest\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nNor is it true that the better understanding of this matter is beyond\r\nthe great mass of men, that sounder ideas depend upon the comprehension\r\nof complex and abstruse points, correct judgment in intricate matters of\r\nfinance or economics. Things which seem in one stage of thought obscure\r\nand difficult are cleared up merely by setting one or two crooked facts\r\nstraight. The rationalists, who a generation or two ago struggled with\r\nsuch things as the prevalent belief in witchcraft, may have deemed that\r\nthe abolition of superstitions of this kind would take \"thousands of\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\nLecky has pointed out that during the eighteenth century many judges in\r\nEurope--not ignorant men, but, on the contrary, exceedingly\r\nwell-educated men, trained to sift evidence--were condemning people to\r\ndeath by hundreds for witchcraft. Acute and educated men still believed\r\nin it; its disproof demanded a large acquaintance with the forces and\r\nprocesses of physical nature, and it was generally thought that, while a\r\nfew exceptional intelligences here and there would shake off these\r\nbeliefs, they would remain indefinitely the possessions of the great\r\nmass of mankind.\r\n\r\nWhat has happened? A schoolboy to-day would scout the evidence which, on\r\nthe judgment of very learned men, sent thousands of poor wretches to\r\ntheir doom in the eighteenth century. Would the schoolboy necessarily be\r\nmore learned or more acute than those judges? They probably knew a great\r\ndeal about the science of witchcraft, were more familiar with its\r\nliterature, with the arguments which supported it, and they would have\r\nhopelessly worsted any nineteenth-century schoolboy in any argument on\r\nthe subject. The point is, however, that the schoolboy would have two or\r\nthree essential facts straight, instead of getting them crooked.\r\n\r\nAll the fine theories about the advantages of conquest, of territorial\r\naggrandizement, so learnedly advanced by the Mahans and the von\r\nStengels; the immense value which the present-day politician attaches to\r\nforeign conquest, all these absurd rivalries aiming at \"stealing\" one\r\nanother's territory, will be recognized as the preposterous illusions\r\nthat they are by the younger mind, which really sees the quite plain\r\nfact that the citizen of a small State is just as well off as the\r\ncitizen of a great. From that fact, which is not complex or difficult\r\nin the least, will emerge the truth that modern government is a matter\r\nof administration, and that it can no more profit a community to annex\r\nother communities, than it could profit London to annex Manchester.\r\nThese things will not need argument to be clear to the schoolboy of the\r\nfuture--they will be self-evident, like the improbability of an old\r\nwoman causing a storm at sea.\r\n\r\nOf course, it is true that many of the factors bearing on this\r\nimprovement will be indirect. As our education becomes more rational in\r\nother fields, it will make for understanding in this; as the visible\r\nfactors of our civilization make plain--as they are making plainer every\r\nday--the unity and interdependence of the modern world, the attempt to\r\nseparate those interdependent activities by irrelevant divisions must\r\nmore and more break down. All improvement in human co-operation--and\r\nhuman co-operation is a synonym for civilization--must help the work of\r\nthose laboring in the field of international relationship. But again I\r\nwould reiterate that the work of the world does not get itself done. It\r\nis done by men; ideas do not improve themselves, they are improved by\r\nthe thought of men; and it is the efficiency of the conscious effort\r\nwhich will mainly determine progress.\r\n\r\nWhen all nations realize that if England can no longer exert force\r\ntowards her Colonies, others certainly could not; that if a great modern\r\nEmpire cannot usefully employ force as against communities that it\r\n\"owns,\" still less can we employ it usefully against communities that\r\nwe do not \"own\"; when the world as a whole has learned the real lesson\r\nof British Imperial development, not only will that Empire have achieved\r\ngreater security than it can achieve by battleships, but it will have\r\nplayed a part in human affairs incomparably greater and more useful than\r\ncould be played by any military \"leadership of the human race,\" that\r\nfutile duplication of the Napoleonic role, which Imperialists of a\r\ncertain school seem to dream for us.\r\n\r\nIt is to Anglo-Saxon practice, and to Anglo-Saxon experience, that the\r\nworld will look as a guide in this matter. The extension of the\r\ndominating principle of the British Empire to European society as a\r\nwhole is the solution of the international problem which this book\r\nurges. That extension cannot be made by military means. The English\r\nconquest of great military nations is a physical impossibility, and it\r\nwould involve the collapse of the principle upon which the Empire is\r\nbased if it were. The day for progress by force has passed; it will be\r\nprogress by ideas or not at all.\r\n\r\nBecause these principles of free human co-operation between communities\r\nare, in a special sense, an Anglo-Saxon development, it is upon us that\r\nthere falls the responsibility of giving a lead. If it does not come\r\nfrom us, who have developed these principles as between all the\r\ncommunities which have sprung from the Anglo-Saxon race, can we ask to\r\nhave it given elsewhere? If we have not faith in our own principles, to\r\nwhom shall we look?\r\n\r\nEnglish thought gave us the science of political economy; Anglo-Saxon\r\nthought and practice must give us another science, that of International\r\nPolity--the science of the political relationship of human groups. We\r\nhave the beginnings of it, but it sadly needs systemization--recognition\r\nby those intellectually equipped to develop it and enlarge it.\r\n\r\nThe developments of such a work would be in keeping with the\r\ncontributions which the practical genius and the positive spirit of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon race have already made to human progress.\r\n\r\nI believe that, if the matter were put efficiently before them with the\r\nforce of that sane, practical, disinterested labor and organization\r\nwhich have been so serviceable in the past in other forms of\r\npropaganda--not only would they prove particularly responsive to the\r\nlabor, but Anglo-Saxon tradition would once more be associated with the\r\nleadership in one of those great moral and intellectual movements which\r\nwould be so fitting a sequel to our leadership in such things as human\r\nfreedom and parliamentary government. Failing such effort and such\r\nresponse, what are we to look for? Are we, in blind obedience to\r\nprimitive instinct and old prejudices, enslaved by the old catchwords\r\nand that curious indolence which makes the revision of old ideas\r\nunpleasant, to duplicate indefinitely on the political and economic side\r\na condition from which we have liberated ourselves on the religious\r\nside? Are we to continue to struggle, as so many good men struggled in\r\nthe first dozen centuries of Christendom--spilling oceans of blood,\r\nwasting mountains of treasure--to achieve what is at bottom a logical\r\nabsurdity; to accomplish something which, when accomplished, can avail\r\nus nothing, and which, if it could avail us anything, would condemn the\r\nnations of the world to never-ending bloodshed and the constant defeat\r\nof all those aims which men, in their sober hours, know to be alone\r\nworthy of sustained endeavor?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nON RECENT EVENTS IN EUROPE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nON RECENT EVENTS IN EUROPE\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the Balkan War \"The Great Illusion\" was subjected to\r\nmuch criticism, on the ground that the war tended to disprove its\r\ntheses. The following quotations, one from Mr. Churchill, the First Lord\r\nof the Admiralty, and the other from the English _Review of Reviews_,\r\nare typical of many others.\r\n\r\nMr. Churchill said, in a speech at Sheffield:\r\n\r\n     Whether we blame the belligerents or criticise the powers, or\r\n     sit in sackcloth and ashes ourselves is absolutely of no\r\n     consequence at the present moment....\r\n\r\n     We have sometimes been assured by persons who profess to know\r\n     that the danger of war has become an illusion.... Well, here is\r\n     a war which has broken out in spite of all that rulers and\r\n     diplomatists could do to prevent it, a war in which the Press\r\n     has had no part, a war which the whole force of the money power\r\n     has been subtly and steadfastly directed to prevent, which has\r\n     come upon us, not through the ignorance or credulity of the\r\n     people, but, on the contrary, through their knowledge of their\r\n     history and their destiny, and through their intense\r\n     realization of their wrongs and of their duties, as they\r\n     conceived them, a war which from all these causes has burst\r\n     upon us with all the force of a spontaneous explosion, and\r\n     which in strife and destruction has carried all before it. Face\r\n     to face with this manifestation, who is the man bold enough to\r\n     say that force is never a remedy? Who is the man who is foolish\r\n     enough to say that martial virtues do not play a vital part in\r\n     the health and honor of every people? (Cheers.) Who is the man\r\n     who is vain enough to suppose that the long antagonisms of\r\n     history and of time can in all circumstances be adjusted by\r\n     the smooth and superficial conventions of politicians and\r\n     ambassadors?\r\n\r\nThe London _Review of Reviews_ said in an article on \"The Debacle of\r\nNorman Angell\":\r\n\r\n     Mr. Norman Angell's theory was one to enable the citizens of\r\n     this country to sleep quietly, and to lull into false security\r\n     the citizens of all great countries. That is undoubtedly the\r\n     reason why he met with so much success.... It was a very\r\n     comfortable theory for those nations which have grown rich and\r\n     whose ideals and initiative have been sapped by overmuch\r\n     prosperity. But the great delusion of Norman Angell, which led\r\n     to the writing of \"The Great Illusion,\" has been dispelled for\r\n     ever by the Balkan League. In this connection it is of value to\r\n     quote the words of Mr. Winston Churchill, which give very\r\n     adequately the reality as opposed to theory.\r\n\r\nIn reply to these and similar criticisms I wrote several articles in the\r\nLondon Press, from which the following few pages are selected.\r\n\r\nWhat has Pacifism, Old or New, to say now?\r\n\r\nIs War impossible?\r\n\r\nIs it unlikely?\r\n\r\nIs it futile?\r\n\r\nIs not force a remedy, and at times the only remedy?\r\n\r\nCould any remedy have been devised on the whole as conclusive and\r\ncomplete as that used by the Balkan peoples?\r\n\r\nHave not the Balkan peoples redeemed War from the charges too readily\r\nbrought against it as simply an instrument of barbarism?\r\n\r\nHave questions of profit and loss, economic considerations, anything\r\nwhatever to do with this war?\r\n\r\nWould the demonstration of its economic futility have kept the peace?\r\n\r\nAre theories and logic of the slightest use, since force alone can\r\ndetermine the issue?\r\n\r\nIs not war therefore inevitable and must we not prepare diligently for\r\nit?\r\n\r\nI will answer all these quite simply and directly without casuistry or\r\nlogic-chopping and honestly desiring to avoid paradox and \"cleverness.\"\r\nNor will these quite simple answers be in contradiction to anything that\r\nI have written, nor will they invalidate any of the principles I have\r\nattempted to explain.\r\n\r\nMy answers may be summarized thus:\r\n\r\n     (1) This war has justified both the Old Pacifism and the New.\r\n     By universal admission events have proved that the Pacifists\r\n     who opposed the Crimean War were right and their opponents\r\n     wrong. Had public opinion given more consideration to those\r\n     Pacifist principles, this country would not have \"backed the\r\n     wrong horse\" and this war, two wars which have preceded it and\r\n     many of the abominations of which the Balkan peninsula has been\r\n     the scene during the last 60 years might have been avoided. In\r\n     any case Great Britain would not now carry upon her shoulders\r\n     the responsibility of having during half a century supported\r\n     the Turk against the Christian and of having tried uselessly to\r\n     prevent what has now taken place--the break-up of the Turk's\r\n     rule in Europe.\r\n\r\n     (2) War is not impossible, and no responsible Pacifist ever\r\n     said it was; it is not the likelihood of war which is the\r\n     illusion, but its benefits.\r\n\r\n     (3) It is likely or unlikely according as the parties to a\r\n     dispute are guided by wisdom or folly.\r\n\r\n     (4) It _is_ futile and force is no remedy.\r\n\r\n     (5) Its futility is proven by the war waged daily by the Turks\r\n     as conquerors, during the last 400 years. And if the Balkan\r\n     peoples choose the less evil of two kinds of war and will use\r\n     their victory to bring a system based on force and conquest to\r\n     an end, we who do not believe in force and conquest will\r\n     rejoice in their action and believe it will achieve immense\r\n     benefits. But if instead of using their victory to eliminate\r\n     force, they in their turn pin their faith to it, continue to\r\n     use it the one against the other and to exploit by its means\r\n     the populations they rule; if they become not the organizers of\r\n     social co-operation among the Balkan populations, but merely,\r\n     like the Turks, their conquerors and \"owners,\" then they in\r\n     their turn will share the fate of the Turks.\r\n\r\n     (6) The fundamental causes of this war are economic in the\r\n     narrower, as well as in the larger sense of the term; in the\r\n     first because conquest was the Turk's only trade--he desired to\r\n     live out of taxes wrung from a conquered people, to exploit\r\n     them as a means of livelihood, and this conception was at the\r\n     root of most of Turkish misgovernment. And in the larger sense\r\n     its cause is economic because in the Balkans, remote\r\n     geographically from the main drift of European economic\r\n     development, there has not grown up that interdependent social\r\n     life, the innumerable contacts which in the rest of Europe have\r\n     done so much to attenuate primitive religious and racial\r\n     hatreds.\r\n\r\n     (7) A better understanding by the Turk of the real nature of\r\n     civilized government, of the economic futility of conquest, of\r\n     the fact that a means of livelihood (an economic system) based\r\n     upon having more force than someone else and using it\r\n     ruthlessly against him is an impossible form of human\r\n     relationship bound to break down, _would_ have kept the peace.\r\n\r\n     (8) If European statecraft had not been animated by false\r\n     conceptions, largely economic in origin, based upon a belief in\r\n     the necessary rivalry of states, the advantages of preponderant\r\n     force and conquest, the Western nations could have composed\r\n     their quarrels and ended the abominations of the Balkan\r\n     peninsula long ago--even in the opinion of the _Times_. And it\r\n     is our own false statecraft--that of Great Britain--which has a\r\n     large part of the responsibility for this failure of European\r\n     civilization. It has caused us to sustain the Turk in Europe,\r\n     to fight a great and popular war with that aim, and led us into\r\n     treaties which, had they been kept, would have obliged us to\r\n     fight to-day on the side of the Turk against the Balkan States.\r\n\r\n     (9) If by \"theories\" and \"logic\" is meant the discussion of and\r\n     interest in principles, the ideas that govern human\r\n     relationship, they are the only things that can prevent future\r\n     wars, just as they were the only things that brought religious\r\n     wars to an end--a preponderant power \"imposing\" peace playing\r\n     no role therein. Just as it was false religious theories which\r\n     made the religious wars, so it is false political theories\r\n     which make the political wars.\r\n\r\n     (10) War is only inevitable in the sense that other forms of\r\n     error and passion--religious persecution for instance--are\r\n     inevitable; they cease with better understanding, as the\r\n     attempt to impose religious belief by force has ceased in\r\n     Europe.\r\n\r\n     (11) We should not prepare for war; we should prepare to\r\n     prevent war; and though that preparation may include\r\n     battleships and conscription, those elements will quite\r\n     obviously make the tension and danger greater unless there is\r\n     also a better European opinion.\r\n\r\nThese summarized replies need a little expansion.\r\n\r\nHad we thrashed out the question of war and peace as we must finally, it\r\nwould hardly be necessary to explain that the apparent paradox in Answer\r\nNo. 4 (that war is futile, and that this war will have immense benefits)\r\nis due to the inadequacy of our language, which compels us to use the\r\nsame word for two opposed purposes, not to any real contradiction of\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nWe called the condition of the Balkan peninsula \"Peace\" until the attack\r\nwas made on Turkey merely because the respective Ambassadors still\r\nhappened to be resident in the capitals to which they were accredited.\r\n\r\nLet us see what \"Peace\" under Turkish rule really meant and who is the\r\nreal invader in this war. Here is a very friendly and impartial\r\nwitness--Sir Charles Elliot--who paints for us the character of the Turk\r\nas an \"administrator\":\r\n\r\n     The Turk in Europe has an overweening sense of his superiority,\r\n     and remains a nation apart, mixing little with the conquered\r\n     populations, whose customs and ideas he tolerates, but makes\r\n     little effort to understand. The expression, indeed, \"Turkey in\r\n     Europe\" means indeed no more than \"England in Asia,\" if used as\r\n     a designation for India.... The Turks have done little to\r\n     assimilate the people whom they have conquered, and still less,\r\n     been assimilated by them. In the larger part of the Turkish\r\n     dominions, the Turks themselves are in a minority.... The Turks\r\n     certainly resent the dismemberment of their Empire, but not in\r\n     the sense in which the French resent the conquest of\r\n     Alsace-Lorraine by Germany. They would never use the word\r\n     \"Turkey\" or even its oriental equivalent, \"The High Country\" in\r\n     ordinary conversation. They would never say that Syria and\r\n     Greece are parts of Turkey which have been detached, but merely\r\n     that they are tributaries which have become independent,\r\n     provinces once occupied by Turks where there are no Turks now.\r\n     As soon as a province passes under another Government, the\r\n     Turks find it the most natural thing in the world to leave it\r\n     and go somewhere else. In the same spirit the Turk talks quite\r\n     pleasantly of leaving Constantinople some day, he will go over\r\n     to Asia and found another capital. One can hardly imagine\r\n     Englishmen speaking like that of London, but they might\r\n     conceivably speak so of Calcutta.... The Turk is a conqueror\r\n     and nothing else. The history of the Turk is a catalogue of\r\n     battles. His contributions to art, literature, science, and\r\n     religion, are practically nil. Their desire has not been to\r\n     instruct, to improve, hardly even to govern, but simply to\r\n     conquer.... The Turk makes nothing at all; he takes whatever he\r\n     can get, as plunder or pillage. He lives in the houses which he\r\n     finds, or which he orders to be built for him. In unfavorable\r\n     circumstances he is a marauder. In favorable, a _Grand\r\n     Seigneur_ who thinks it his right to enjoy with grace and\r\n     dignity all that the world can hold, but who will not lower\r\n     himself by engaging in art, literature, trade, or manufacture.\r\n     Why should he, when there are other people to do these things\r\n     for him. Indeed, it may be said that he takes from others even\r\n     his religion, clothes, language, customs; there is hardly\r\n     anything which is Turkish and not borrowed. The religion is\r\n     Arabic; the language half Arabic and Persian; the literature\r\n     almost entirely imitative; the art Persian or Byzantine; the\r\n     costumes, in the Upper Classes and Army mostly European. There\r\n     is nothing characteristic in manufacture or commerce, except an\r\n     aversion to such pursuits. In fact, all occupations, except\r\n     agriculture and military service are distasteful to the true\r\n     Osmanli. He is not much of a merchant. He may keep a stall in a\r\n     bazaar, but his operations are rarely undertaken on a scale\r\n     which merits the name of commerce or finance. It is strange to\r\n     observe how, when trade becomes active in any seaport, or upon\r\n     the railway lines, the Osmanli retires and disappears, while\r\n     Greeks, Armenians, and Levantines thrive in his place. Neither\r\n     does he much affect law, medicine or the learned professions.\r\n     Such callings are followed by Moslems but they are apt to be\r\n     of non-Turkish race. But though he does none of these things\r\n     ... the Turk is a soldier. The moment a sword or rifle is put\r\n     into his hands, he instinctively knows how to use it with\r\n     effect, and feels at home in the ranks or on a horse. The\r\n     Turkish Army is not so much a profession or an institution\r\n     necessitated by the fears and aims of the Government as the\r\n     quite normal state of the Turkish nation.... Every Turk is a\r\n     born soldier, and adopts other pursuits chiefly because times\r\n     are bad. When there is a question of fighting, if only in a\r\n     riot, the stolid peasant wakes up and shows surprising power of\r\n     finding organization and expedients, and alas! a surprising\r\n     ferocity. The ordinary Turk is an honest and good-humored soul,\r\n     kind to children and animals, and very patient; but when the\r\n     fighting spirit comes on him, he becomes like the terrible\r\n     warriors of the Huns or Genghis Khan, and slays, burns, and\r\n     ravages without mercy or discrimination.[122]\r\n\r\nSuch is the verdict of an instructed, travelled, and observant English\r\nauthor and diplomatist, who lived among these people for many years and\r\nwho learned to like them, who studied them and their history. It does\r\nnot differ, of course, appreciably, from what practically every student\r\nof the Turk has discovered: the Turk is the typical conqueror. His\r\nnation has lived by the sword and to-day he is dying by the sword,\r\nbecause the sword, the mere exercise of force by one man or group of men\r\nupon another, conquest in other words, is an impossible form of human\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\nIn order to maintain this evil form of relationship--its evil and\r\nfutility constitute the whole basis of the principles I have attempted\r\nto illustrate--he has not even observed the rough chivalry of the\r\nbrigand. The brigand, though he might knock men on the head, will\r\nrefrain from having his force take the form of butchering women and\r\ndisembowelling children. Not so the Turk. His attempt at Government will\r\ntake the form of the obscene torture of children, of a bestial ferocity\r\nwhich is not a matter of dispute or exaggeration, but a thing to which\r\nscores, hundreds, thousands even of credible European witnesses have\r\ntestified. \"The finest gentleman, sir, that ever butchered a woman or\r\nburned a village,\" is the phrase that _Punch_ most justly puts into the\r\nmouth of the defender of our traditional Turcophil policy.\r\n\r\nThis condition is \"Peace\" and the act which would put a stop to it is\r\n\"War\"! It is the inexactitude and inadequacy of our language which\r\ncreate much of the confusion of thought in this matter; we have the same\r\nterm for action destined to achieve a given end and for counter-action\r\ndestined to prevent it.\r\n\r\nYet we manage in other than the international field, in civil matters,\r\nto make the thing clear enough.\r\n\r\nOnce an American town was set on fire by incendiaries and was threatened\r\nwith destruction. In order to save at least a part of it the authorities\r\ndeliberately burned down a block of buildings in the pathway of the\r\nfire. Would those incendiaries be entitled to say that the town\r\nauthorities were incendiaries also and \"believed in setting fire to\r\ntowns\"? Yet this is precisely the point of view of those who tax\r\nPacifists with approving war because they approve the measure aimed at\r\nbringing it to an end.\r\n\r\nPut it another way. You do not believe that force should determine the\r\ntransfer of property or conformity to a creed, and I say to you: \"Hand\r\nme your purse and conform to my creed or I kill you.\" You say: \"Because\r\nI do not believe that force should settle these matters, I shall try to\r\nprevent it settling them; therefore if you attack I shall resist; if I\r\ndid not I should be allowing force to settle them.\" I attack; you resist\r\nand disarm me and say: \"My force having neutralized yours and, the\r\nequilibrium being now established, I will hear any reasons you may have\r\nto urge for my paying you money or any argument in favor of your creed.\r\nReason, understanding, adjustment shall settle it.\" You would be a\r\nPacifist. Or, if you deem that that word connotes non-resistance, though\r\nto the immense bulk of Pacifists it does not, you would be an\r\nAnti-bellicist, to use a dreadful word coined by M. Emile Faguet in the\r\ndiscussion of this matter. If however you said: \"Having disarmed you and\r\nestablished the equilibrium, I shall now upset it in my favor by taking\r\nyour weapon and using it against you unless you hand me _your_ purse and\r\nsubscribe to _my_ creed. I do this because force alone can determine\r\nissues and because it is a law of life that the strong should eat up the\r\nweak,\" you would then be a Bellicist.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, when we prevent the brigand from carrying on his\r\ntrade--taking wealth by force--it is not because we believe in force as\r\na means of livelihood, but precisely because we do not. And if, in\r\npreventing the brigand from knocking out brains, we are compelled to\r\nknock out his brains, is it because we believe in knocking out people's\r\nbrains? Or would we urge that to do so is the way to carry on a trade or\r\nto govern a nation or that it could be the basis of human relationship?\r\n\r\nIn every civilized country, the basis of the relationship on which the\r\ncommunity rests is this: no individual is allowed to settle his\r\ndifferences with another by force. But does this mean that if one\r\nthreatens to take my purse, I am not allowed to use force to prevent it?\r\nThat if he threatens to kill me, I am not to defend myself, because \"the\r\nindividual citizens are not allowed to settle their differences by\r\nforce\"? It is _because_ of that, because the act of self-defence is an\r\nattempt to prevent the settlement of a difference by force, that the law\r\njustifies it.[123]\r\n\r\nBut the law would not justify me if, having disarmed my opponent, having\r\nneutralized his force by my own and re-established the social\r\nequilibrium, I immediately proceeded to upset it by asking him for his\r\npurse on pain of murder. I should then be settling the matter by\r\nforce--I should then have ceased to be a Pacifist and have become a\r\nBellicist.\r\n\r\nFor that is the difference between the two conceptions; the Bellicist\r\nsays: \"Force alone can settle these matters; it is the final appeal,\r\ntherefore fight it out; let the best man win. When you have preponderant\r\nstrength, impose your view; force the other man to your will; not\r\nbecause it is right, but because you are able to do so.\" It is the\r\n\"excellent policy\" which Lord Roberts attributes to Germany and\r\napproves.\r\n\r\nWe Anti-bellicists take an exactly contrary view. We say: \"To fight it\r\nout settles nothing, since it is not a question of who is stronger, but\r\nof whose view is best and, as that is not always easy to establish, it\r\nis of the utmost importance in the interest of all parties, in the long\r\nrun, to keep force out of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe former is the policy of the Turks. They have been obsessed with the\r\nidea that, if only they had enough of physical force ruthlessly\r\nexercised, they could solve the whole question of government, of\r\nexistence for that matter, without troubling about social adjustment,\r\nunderstanding, equity, law, commerce; that \"blood and iron\" were all\r\nthat was needed. The success of that policy can now be judged.\r\n\r\nGood or evil will come of the present war according as the Balkan States\r\nare on the whole guided by the Bellicist or by the opposed principle.\r\nIf, having now momentarily eliminated force as between themselves, they\r\nre-introduce it; if the strongest, presumably Bulgaria,[124] adopts Lord\r\nRoberts's \"excellent policy\" of striking because she has the\r\npreponderant force, enters upon a career of conquest of other members of\r\nthe Balkan League and of the populations of the conquered territories\r\nand uses them for exploitation by military force--why then there will be\r\nno settlement and this war will have accomplished nothing save futile\r\nwaste and slaughter. For they will have taken under a new flag, the\r\npathway of the Turk to savagery, degeneration, death.\r\n\r\nIf on the other hand they are guided more by the Pacifist principle, if\r\nthey believe that co-operation among States is better than conflict, if\r\nthey believe that the common interest of all in good Government is\r\ngreater than the special interest of anyone in conquest, that the\r\nunderstanding of human relationships, the capacity for the organization\r\nof society are the means by which men progress and not the imposition of\r\nforce by one man or group upon another, why, they will have taken the\r\npathway to better civilization. But then they will have disregarded Lord\r\nRoberts's advice.\r\n\r\nThis distinction between the two systems, far from being a matter of\r\nabstract theory of metaphysics or logic-chopping, is just the difference\r\nwhich distinguishes the Anglo-Saxon from the Turk, which distinguishes\r\nAmerica from Turkey. The Turk has as much physical vigor as the\r\nAmerican, is as virile, manly, and military. The Turk has the same raw\r\nmaterials of Nature, soil, and water. There is no difference in the\r\ncapacity for the exercise of physical force--or if there is, the\r\ndifference is in favor of the Turk. The real difference is a difference\r\nof ideas, of mind, outlook on the part of the individuals composing the\r\nrespective societies; the Turk has one general conception of human\r\nsociety and the code and principles upon which it is founded, mainly a\r\nMilitarist one; the American has another, mainly a Pacifist one. And\r\nwhether the European society as a whole is to drift towards the Turkish\r\nideal or towards the Anglo-Saxon ideal will depend upon whether it is\r\nanimated mainly by the Pacifist or mainly by the Bellicist doctrine; if\r\nthe former, it will stagger blindly like the Turk along the path to\r\nbarbarism; if the latter, it will take a better road.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with answer No. 4 I have shown how the ambiguity of\r\nterms[125] used leads us so much astray in our notions of the real role\r\nof force in human relationships. But there is a curious phenomenon of\r\nthought which explains perhaps still more how misconceptions grow up on\r\nthis subject and that is the habit of thinking of a war which, of\r\ncourse, must include two parties in terms solely of one party at a time.\r\nThus one critic[126] is quite sure that because the Balkan peoples\r\n\"recked nothing of financial disaster,\" economic considerations have had\r\nnothing to do with their war--a conclusion which seems to be arrived at\r\nby the process of judgment just indicated: to find the cause of\r\nconditions produced by two parties you shall rigorously ignore one. For\r\nthere is a great deal of internal evidence for believing that the writer\r\nof the article in question would admit very readily that the efforts of\r\nthe Turk to wring taxes out of the conquered peoples--not in return for\r\na civilized administration, but simply as the means of livelihood, of\r\nturning conquest into a trade--had a very great deal to do in explaining\r\nthe Turk's presence there at all and the Christian's desire to get rid\r\nof him; while the same article specifically states that the mutual\r\njealousies of the great Powers, based on a desire to \"grab\" (an economic\r\nmotive), had a great deal to do with preventing a peaceful settlement of\r\nthe difficulties. Yet \"economics\" have nothing to do with it!\r\n\r\nI have attempted elsewhere to make these two points--that it is on the\r\none hand the false economics of the Turks and on the other hand the\r\nfalse economics of the Powers of Europe, coloring the policy and\r\nstatecraft of both, which have played an enormous, in all human\r\nprobability, a determining role in the immediate cause of the war; and,\r\nof course, a further and more remote cause of the whole difficulty is\r\nthe fact that the Balkan peoples, never having been subjected to the\r\ndiscipline of that complex social life which arises from trade and\r\ncommerce have not, or at least not so completely, outgrown those\r\nprimitive racial and religious hostilities which at one time in Europe\r\nas a whole provoked conflicts like that now raging in the Balkans. The\r\nfollowing article which appeared[127] at the outbreak of the war may\r\nsummarise some of the points with which we have been dealing:--\r\n\r\n     \"Polite and good-natured people think it rude to say 'Balkans'\r\n     if a Pacifist be present. Yet I never understood why, and I\r\n     understand now less than ever. It carries the implication that\r\n     because war has broken out that fact disposes of all objection\r\n     to it. The armies are at grips, therefore peace is a mistake.\r\n     Passion reigns in the Balkans, therefore passion is preferable\r\n     to reason.\r\n\r\n     \"I suppose cannibalism and infanticide, polygamy, judicial\r\n     torture, religious persecution, witchcraft, during all the\r\n     years we did these 'inevitable' things, were defended in the\r\n     same way, and those who resented all criticism of them pointed\r\n     in triumph to the cannibal feast, the dead child, the maimed\r\n     witness, the slain heretic, or the burned witch. But the fact\r\n     did not prove the wisdom of those habits, still less their\r\n     inevitability; for we have them no more.\r\n\r\n     \"We are all agreed as to the fundamental cause of the Balkan\r\n     trouble: the hate born of religious, racial, national, and\r\n     linguistic differences; the attempt of an alien conqueror to\r\n     live parasitically upon the conquered, and the desire of\r\n     conqueror and conquered alike to satisfy in massacre and\r\n     bloodshed the rancor of fanaticism and hatred.\r\n\r\n     \"Well, in these islands, not so very long ago, those things\r\n     were causes of bloodshed; indeed, they were a common feature of\r\n     European life. But if they are inevitable in human\r\n     relationship, how comes it that Adana is no longer duplicated\r\n     by St. Bartholomew; the Bulgarian bands by the vendetta of the\r\n     Highlander and the Lowlander; the struggle of the Slav and\r\n     Turk, Serb and Bulgar, by that of Scots and English, and\r\n     English and Welsh? The fanaticism of the Moslem to-day is no\r\n     more intense than that of Catholic and heretic in Rome, Madrid,\r\n     Paris, and Geneva at a time which is only separated from us by\r\n     the lives of three or four elderly men. The heretic or infidel\r\n     was then in Europe also a thing unclean and horrifying,\r\n     exciting in the mind of the orthodox a sincere and honest\r\n     hatred and a (very largely satisfied) desire to kill. The\r\n     Catholic of the 16th century was apt to tell you that he could\r\n     not sit at table with a heretic because the latter carried with\r\n     him a distinctive and overpoweringly repulsive odor. If you\r\n     would measure the distance Europe has travelled, think what\r\n     this means: all the nations of Christendom united in a war\r\n     lasting 200 years for the capture of the Holy Sepulchre; and\r\n     yet, when in our day their representatives, seated round a\r\n     table, could have had it for the asking, they did not deem it\r\n     worth the asking, so little of the ancient passion was there\r\n     left. The very nature of man seemed to be transformed. For,\r\n     wonderful though it be that orthodox should cease killing\r\n     heretic, infinitely more wonderful still is it that he should\r\n     cease wanting to kill him.\r\n\r\n     \"Just as most of us are certain that the underlying causes of\r\n     this conflict are 'inevitable' and 'inherent in unchanging\r\n     human nature,' so are we certain that so _un_-human a thing as\r\n     economics can have no bearing on it.\r\n\r\n     \"Well, I will suggest that the transformation of the\r\n     heretic-hating and heretic-killing European is due mainly to\r\n     economic forces; that it is because the drift of those forces\r\n     has to so great a degree left the Balkans, where until\r\n     yesterday the people lived a life little different from that\r\n     which they lived in the time of Abraham, unaffected that war is\r\n     now raging; that economic factors of a more immediate kind form\r\n     a large part of the provoking cause of that war; and that a\r\n     better comprehension by great nations of Europe of certain\r\n     economic facts of their international relationship is essential\r\n     before much progress towards solution can be made.\r\n\r\n     \"But then by 'economics' of course I mean, not a merchant's\r\n     profit or a money-lender's interest, but the method by which\r\n     men earn their bread, which must also mean the kind of life\r\n     they lead.\r\n\r\n     \"We generally think of the primitive life of man--that of the\r\n     herdsman or the tent liver--as something idyllic. The picture\r\n     is as far as possible from the truth. Those into whose lives\r\n     economics do not enter, or enter very little--that is to say,\r\n     those who, like the Congo cannibal, or the Red Indian, or the\r\n     Bedouin, do not cultivate, or divide their labor, or trade, or\r\n     save, or look to the future, have shed little of the primitive\r\n     passions of other animals of prey, the tigers and the wolves,\r\n     who have no economics at all, and have no need to check an\r\n     impulse or a hate. But industry, even of the more primitive\r\n     kind, means that men must divide their labor, which means that\r\n     they must put some sort of reliance upon one another; the thing\r\n     of prey becomes a partner, and the attitude towards it changes.\r\n     And as this life becomes more complex, as the daily needs and\r\n     desires push men to trade and barter, that means building up a\r\n     social organization, rules and codes and courts to enforce\r\n     them; as the interdependence widens and deepens it necessarily\r\n     means the cessation of certain hostilities. If the neighboring\r\n     tribe wants to trade with you it must not kill you; if you want\r\n     the services of the heretic you must not kill him, you must\r\n     keep your obligation towards him, and mutual good faith is\r\n     death to long-sustained hatreds.\r\n\r\n     \"You cannot separate the moral from the social and economic\r\n     development of a people. The great service of a complex social\r\n     and industrial organization, which is built up by the desire of\r\n     men for better material conditions, is not that it 'pays,' but\r\n     that it makes a more interdependent human society, and that it\r\n     leads men to recognize what is the best relationship among\r\n     them. The fact of recognizing that some act of aggression is\r\n     causing stocks to fall is not important because it may save\r\n     Oppenheim's or Solomon's money but because it is a\r\n     demonstration that we are dependent upon some community on the\r\n     other side of the world, that their damage is our damage, and\r\n     that we have an interest in preventing it. It teaches us, as\r\n     only some such simple and mechanical means can teach, the\r\n     lesson of human fellowship.\r\n\r\n     \"It is by such means as this that Western Europe has in some\r\n     measure, within its respective political frontiers, learned\r\n     that lesson. Each nation has learned, within its own confines\r\n     at least, that wealth is made by work, not robbery; that,\r\n     indeed, general robbery is fatal to prosperity; that government\r\n     consists not merely in having the power of the sword but in\r\n     organizing society--in 'knowing how,' which means the\r\n     development of ideas; in maintaining courts; in making it\r\n     possible to run railways, post-offices, and all the\r\n     contrivances of a complex society.\r\n\r\n     \"Now rulers did not create these things; it was the daily\r\n     activities of the people, born of their desires and made\r\n     possible by the circumstances in which they lived, by the\r\n     trading and the mining and the shipping which they carried on,\r\n     that made them. But the Balkans have been geographically\r\n     outside the influence of European industrial and commercial\r\n     life. The Turk has hardly felt it at all. He has learned none\r\n     of the social and moral lessons which interdependence and\r\n     improved communications have taught the Western European, and\r\n     it is because he had not learned these lessons, because he is a\r\n     soldier and a conqueror to an extent and completeness that\r\n     other nations of Europe lost a generation or two since, that\r\n     the Balkanese are fighting and that war is raging.\r\n\r\n     \"Not merely in this larger sense, but in the more immediate,\r\n     narrower sense, are the fundamental causes of this war\r\n     economic.\r\n\r\n     \"This war arises, as the past wars against the Turkish\r\n     conqueror have arisen, from the desire of the Christian peoples\r\n     on whom he lives to shake off this burden. \"To live upon their\r\n     subjects is the Turks' only means of livelihood,\" says one\r\n     authority. The Turk is an economic parasite and the healthy\r\n     economic organism must end by rejecting him.\r\n\r\n     \"The management of society, simple and primitive even as that\r\n     of the Balkan mountains, needs some effort and work and\r\n     capacity for administration; otherwise even rudimentary\r\n     economic life cannot be carried on. The Turkish system, founded\r\n     on the sword and nothing else ('the finest soldier in Europe'),\r\n     cannot give that small modicum of energy or administrative\r\n     capacity. The one thing he knows is brute force; but it is not\r\n     by the strength of his muscles that an engineer runs a\r\n     machine, but by knowing how. The Turk cannot build a road or\r\n     make a bridge or administer a post-office or found a court of\r\n     law. And these things are necessary. He will not let them be\r\n     done by the Christian, who, because he did not belong to the\r\n     conquering class, has had to work and has consequently come to\r\n     possess whatever capacity for work and administration the\r\n     country can show, because to do so would be to threaten the\r\n     Turk's only trade. In the Turk granted the Christians equal\r\n     political rights they would inevitably 'run the country.' And\r\n     yet the Turk himself cannot do it; and he will not let others\r\n     do it, because to do so would be to threaten his supremacy.\r\n\r\n     \"The more the use of force fails, the more, of course, does he\r\n     resort to it and that is why many of us who do not believe in\r\n     force and desire to see it disappear from the relationship not\r\n     merely of religious but of political groups, might conceivably\r\n     welcome this war of the Balkan Christians, in so far as it is\r\n     an attempt to resist the use of force in those relationships.\r\n     Of course, I do not try to estimate the 'balance of\r\n     criminality.' Right is not all on one side--it never is. But\r\n     the broad issue is clear and plain. And only those concerned\r\n     with the name rather than the thing, with nominal and verbal\r\n     consistency rather than realities, will see anything\r\n     paradoxical or contradictory in Pacifist approval of Christian\r\n     resistance to the use of Turkish force.\r\n\r\n     \"One fact stands out incontrovertibly from the whole weary\r\n     muddle. It is quite clear that the inability to act in concert\r\n     arises from the fact that in the international sphere the\r\n     European is still dominated by illusions which he has dropped\r\n     when he deals with home politics. The political faith of the\r\n     Turk, which he would never think of applying at home as among\r\n     the individuals of his nation, he applies pure and unalloyed\r\n     when he comes to deal with foreigners as nations. The economic\r\n     conception--using the term in that wider sense which I have\r\n     indicated earlier in this article--which guides his individual\r\n     conduct is the antithesis of that which guides his national\r\n     conduct.\r\n\r\n     \"While the Christian does not believe in robbery inside the\r\n     frontier, he does without; while within the State he realizes\r\n     that it is better for each to observe the general code, so that\r\n     civilized society can exist, than for each to disregard it, so\r\n     that society goes to pieces; while within the State he realizes\r\n     that government is a matter of administration, not the seizure\r\n     of property; that one town does not add to its wealth by\r\n     'capturing' another, that indeed one community cannot 'own'\r\n     another--while, I say, he believes all these things in his\r\n     daily life at home, he disregards them all when he comes to the\r\n     field of international relationship, _la haute politique_. To\r\n     annex some province by a cynical breach of treaty obligation\r\n     (Austria in Bosnia, Italy in Tripoli) is regarded as better\r\n     politics than to act loyally with the community of nations to\r\n     enforce their common interest in order and good government. In\r\n     fact, we do not believe that there can be a community of\r\n     nations, because, in fact, we do not believe that their\r\n     interests are common, but rival; like the Turk, we believe that\r\n     if you do not exercise force upon your 'rival' he will exercise\r\n     it upon you; that nations live upon one another, not by\r\n     co-operation with one another--and it is for this reason\r\n     presumably that you must 'own' as much of your neighbors as\r\n     possible. It is the Turkish conception from beginning to end.\r\n\r\n     \"It is because these false beliefs prevent the nations of\r\n     Christendom acting loyally the one to the other, because each\r\n     is playing for its own hand, that the Turk, with hint of some\r\n     sordid bribe, has been able to play off each against the other.\r\n\r\n     \"This is the crux of the matter. When Europe can honestly act\r\n     in common on behalf of common interests some solution can be\r\n     found. And the capacity of Europe to act in harmony will not be\r\n     found as long as the accepted doctrines of European statecraft\r\n     remain unchanged, as long as they are dominated by existing\r\n     illusions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"The True Way of Life\" (Headley Brothers, London), p. 29. I am aware\r\nthat many modern pacifists, even of the English school, to which these\r\nremarks mainly apply, are more objective in their advocacy than Mr.\r\nGrubb, but in the eyes of the \"average sensual man\" pacificism is still\r\ndeeply tainted with this self-sacrificing altruism (see Chapter III.,\r\nPart III.), notwithstanding the admirable work of the French pacifist\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n[2] The _Matin_ newspaper recently made a series of revelations, in\r\nwhich it was shown that the master of a French cod-fishing vessel had,\r\nfor some trivial insubordinations, disembowelled his cabin-boy alive,\r\nand put salt into the intestines, and then thrown the quivering body\r\ninto the hold with the cod-fish. So inured were the crew to brutality\r\nthat they did not effectively protest, and the incident was only brought\r\nto light months later by wine-shop chatter. The _Matin_ quotes this as\r\nthe sort of brutality that marks the Newfoundland cod-fishing industry\r\nin French ships.\r\n\r\nAgain, the German Socialist papers have recently been dealing with what\r\nthey term \"The Casualties of the Industrial Battlefield,\" showing that\r\nthe losses from industrial accidents since 1871--the loss of life during\r\npeace, that is--have been enormously greater than the losses due to the\r\nFranco-Prussian War.\r\n\r\n[3] \"The Interest of America in International Conditions.\" New York:\r\nHarper & Brothers.\r\n\r\n[4] That is to say, all this was to have taken place before 1911 (the\r\nbook appeared some years ago). This has its counterpart in the English\r\nnewspaper feuilleton which appeared some years ago entitled, \"The German\r\nInvasion of 1910.\"\r\n\r\n[5] See letter to the _Matin_, August 22, 1908.\r\n\r\n[6] In this self-seeking world, it is not reasonable to assume the\r\nexistence of an inverted altruism of this kind.\r\n\r\n[7] This is not the only basis of comparison, of course. Everyone who\r\nknows Europe at all is aware of the high standard of comfort in all the\r\nsmall countries--Scandinavia, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland. Mulhall, in\r\n\"Industries and Wealth of Nations\" (p. 391), puts the small States of\r\nEurope with France and England at the top of the list, Germany _sixth_,\r\nand Russia, territorially and militarily the greatest of all, at the\r\nvery end. Dr. Bertillon, the French statistician, has made an elaborate\r\ncalculation of the relative wealth of the individuals of each country.\r\nThe middle-aged German possesses (on the established average) nine\r\nthousand francs ($1800); the Hollander _sixteen thousand_ ($3200). (See\r\n_Journal_, Paris, August 1, 1910).\r\n\r\n[8] The figures given in the \"Statesman's Year-Book\" show that,\r\nproportionately to population, Norway has nearly three times the\r\ncarrying trade of England.\r\n\r\n[9] See citation, pp. 14-15.\r\n\r\n[10] Major Stewart Murray, \"Future Peace of the Anglo-Saxons.\" London:\r\nWatts and Co.\r\n\r\n[11] _L'Information_, August 22, 1909.\r\n\r\n[12] Very many times greater, because the bullion reserve in the Bank of\r\nEngland is relatively small.\r\n\r\n[13] Hartley Withers, \"The Meaning of Money.\" Smith, Elder and Co.,\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n[14] See pp. 75-76.\r\n\r\n[15] See note concerning French colonial policy, pp. 122-124.\r\n\r\n[16] Summarizing an article in the _Oriental Economic Review_, the San\r\nFrancisco _Bulletin_ says: \"Japan at this moment seems to be finding out\r\nthat 'conquered' Korea in every real sense belongs to the Koreans, and\r\nthat all that Japan is getting out of her war is an additional burden of\r\nstatesmanship and an additional expense of administration, and an\r\nincreased percentage of international complication due to the extension\r\nof the Japanese frontier dangerously close to her Continental rivals,\r\nChina and Russia. Japan as 'owner' of Korea is in a worse position\r\neconomically and politically than she was when she was compelled to\r\ntreat with Korea as an independent nation.\" The _Oriental Economic\r\nReview_ notes that \"the Japanese hope to ameliorate the Korean situation\r\nthrough the general intermarriage of the two peoples; but this means a\r\nracial advance, and through it closer social and economic relations than\r\nwere possible before annexation, and would probably have been easier of\r\naccomplishment had not the destruction of Korean independence embittered\r\nthe people.\"\r\n\r\n[17] Spanish Four per Cents. were 42-1/2 during the war, and just prior\r\nto the Moroccan trouble, in 1911, had a free market at 90 per cent.\r\n\r\nF.C. Penfold writes in the December (1910) _North American Review_ as\r\nfollows: \"The new Spain, whose motive force springs not from the\r\nwindmills of dreamy fiction, but from honest toil, is materially better\r\noff this year than it has been for generations. Since the war Spanish\r\nbonds have practically doubled in value, and exchange with foreign money\r\nmarkets has improved in corresponding ratio. Spanish seaports on the\r\nAtlantic and Mediterranean teem with shipping. Indeed, the nature of the\r\npeople seems changing from a _dolce far niente_ indolence to\r\nenterprising thrift.\"\r\n\r\n[18] London _Daily Mail_, December 15, 1910.\r\n\r\n[19] \"Traite de Science des Finances,\" vol. ii., p. 682.\r\n\r\n[20] \"Die Wirtschafts Finanz und Sozialreform im Deutschen Reich.\"\r\nLeipzig, 1882.\r\n\r\n[21] \"La Crise Economique,\" _Revue des Deux Mondes_, March 15, 1879.\r\n\r\n[22] Maurice Block, \"La Crise Economique,\" _Revue des Deux Mondes_,\r\nMarch 15, 1879.

The author says (p.\r\n127): \"It was evidently the disastrous financial position of Germany,\r\nwhich had compelled Prussia at the outbreak of the war to borrow money\r\nat the unheard-of price of 11 per cent., that caused Bismarck to make\r\nthe indemnity so large a one. He hoped thus to repair his country's\r\nfinancial situation. Events cruelly deceived him, however. A few months\r\nafter the last payment of the indemnity the gold despatched by France\r\nhad already returned to her territory, while Germany, poorer than ever,\r\nwas at grips with a crisis which was to a large extent the direct result\r\nof her temporary wealth.\"\r\n\r\n[23] \"Das Deutsche Reich zur Zeit Bismarcks.\"\r\n\r\n[24] The figures of German emigration are most suggestive in this\r\nconnection. Although they show great fluctuation, indicating their\r\nreaction to many factors, they always appear to rise after the wars.\r\nThus, after the wars of the Duchies they doubled, for the five years\r\npreceding the campaigns of 1865 they averaged 41,000, and after those\r\ncampaigns rose suddenly to over 100,000. They had fallen to 70,000 in\r\n1869, and then rose to 154,000 in 1872, and what is more remarkable\r\nstill, the emigration did not come from the conquered provinces, from\r\nSchleswig-Holstein, Alsace or Lorraine, but from Prussia! While not for\r\na moment claiming that the effect of the wars is the sole factor in this\r\nfluctuation, the fact of emigration as bearing on the general claim made\r\nfor successful war demands the most careful examination. See\r\nparticularly, \"L'Emigration Allemande,\" _Revue des Deux Mondes_,\r\nJanuary, 1874.\r\n\r\n[25] The Montreal _Presse_, March 27, 1909.\r\n\r\n[26] Speech, House of Commons, August 26, 1909. The New York papers of\r\nNovember 16, 1909, report the following from Sir Wilfrid Laurier in the\r\nDominion Parliament during the debate on the Canadian Navy: \"If now we\r\nhave to organize a naval force, it is because we are growing as a\r\nnation--it is the penalty of being a nation. I know of no nation having\r\na sea-coast of its own which has no navy, except Norway, but Norway will\r\nnever tempt the invader. Canada has its coal-mines, its gold-mines, its\r\nwheat-fields, and its vast wealth may offer a temptation to the\r\ninvader.\"\r\n\r\n[27] The recent tariff negotiations between Canada and the United States\r\nwere carried on directly between Ottawa and Washington, without the\r\nintervention of London. Canada regularly conducts her tariff\r\nnegotiations, even with other members of the British Empire. South\r\nAfrica takes a like attitude. The _Volkstein_ of July 10, 1911, says:\r\n\"The Union constitution is in full accord with the principle that\r\nneutrality is permissible in the case of a war in which England and\r\nother independent States of the Empire are involved.... England, as well\r\nas South Africa, would best be served by South Africa's neutrality\"\r\n(quoted in _Times_, July 11, 1911). Note the phrase \"independent States\r\nof the Empire.\"\r\n\r\n[28] _Times_, November 7, 1911.\r\n\r\n[29] The London _World_, an Imperialist organ, puts it thus: \"The\r\nelectoral process of reversing the results of the war is completed in\r\nSouth Africa. By the result of last week's contests Mr. Merriman has\r\nsecured a strong working majority in both Houses. The triumph of the\r\nBond at Cape Town is no less sweeping than was that of Het Volk at\r\nPretoria. The three territories upon which the future of the\r\nsubcontinent depends are linked together under Boer supremacy ... the\r\nfuture federated or uniformed system will be raised upon a Dutch basis.\r\nIf this was what we wanted, we might have bought it cheaper than with\r\ntwo hundred and fifty millions of money and twenty thousand lives.\"\r\n\r\n[30] A Bill has been introduced into the Indian Legislative Council\r\nenabling the Government to prohibit emigration to any country where the\r\ntreatment accorded to British Indian subjects was not such as met with\r\nthe approval of the Governor-General. \"As just treatment for free\r\nIndians has not been secured,\" says the London _Times_, \"prohibition\r\nwill undoubtedly be applied against Natal unless the position of free\r\nIndians there is ameliorated.\"\r\n\r\n[31] Britain's total overseas trade for 1908 was $5,245,000,000, of\r\nwhich $3,920,000,000 was with foreigners, and $1,325,000,000 with her\r\nown possessions. And while it is true that with some of her Colonies\r\nBritain has as much as 52 per cent. of their trade--_e.g._,\r\nAustralia--it also happens that some absolutely foreign countries do a\r\ngreater percentage even of their trade with Britain than do her\r\nColonies. Britain possesses 38 per cent. of Argentina's foreign trade,\r\nbut only 36 per cent. of Canada's, although Canada has recently given\r\nher a considerable preference.\r\n\r\n[32] West Africa and Madagascar.\r\n\r\n[33] It is a little encouraging, perhaps, for those of us who are doing\r\nwhat we may towards the dissemination of saner ideas, that an early\r\nedition of this book seems to have played some part in bringing about\r\nthe change in French colonial policy here indicated. The French Colonial\r\nMinistry, for the purpose of emphasizing the point of view mentioned in\r\n_Le Temps_ article, on two or three occasions called pointed attention\r\nto the first French edition of this book. In the official report of the\r\nColonial Budget for 1911, a large part of this chapter is reprinted. In\r\nthe Senate (see _Journal Officiel de la Republique Francaise_, July 2,\r\n1911) the Rapporteur again quoted from this book at length, and devoted\r\na great part of his speech towards emphasizing the thesis here set out.\r\n\r\n[34] A financier to whom I showed the proofs of this chapter notes here:\r\n\"If such a tax were imposed the output would be _nil_.\"\r\n\r\n[35] A correspondent sent me some interesting and significant details of\r\nthe rapid strides made by Germany in Egypt. It had already been stated\r\nthat a German newspaper would appear in October, 1910, and that the\r\nofficial notices of the mixed courts have been transferred from the\r\nlocal French newspapers to the German _Egyptischer Nachrichten_. During\r\nthe years 1897-1907, German residents in Egypt increased by 44 per\r\ncent., while British residents increased by only 5 per cent. Germany's\r\nshare of the Egyptian imports during the period 1900-1904 was\r\n$3,443,880, but by 1909 this figure reached $5,786,355. The latest\r\nGerman undertaking in Egypt was the foundation of the Egyptische\r\nHypotheken Bank, in which all the principal joint-stock banks of Germany\r\nwere interested. Its capital was to be $2,500,000 and the six directors\r\nincluded three Germans, one Austrian, and two Italians.\r\n\r\nWriting of \"Home Sickness among the Emigrants\" (the _London World_, July\r\n19, 1910), Mr. F.G. Aflalo said:\r\n\r\n\"The Germans are, of all nations, the least troubled with this weakness.\r\nThough far more warmly attached to the hearth than their neighbors\r\nacross the Rhine, they feel exile less. Their one idea is to evade\r\nconscription, and this offers to all continental nations a compensation\r\nfor exile, which to the Englishman means nothing. I remember a colony of\r\nGerman fishermen on Lake Tahoe, the loveliest water in California, where\r\nthe pines of the Sierra Nevada must have vividly recalled their native\r\nHarz. Yet they rejoiced in the freedom of their adopted country, and\r\nnever knew a moment's regret for the Fatherland.\"\r\n\r\n[36] According to a recent estimate, the Germans in Brazil now number\r\nsome four hundred thousand, the great majority being settled in the\r\nsouthern states of Rio Grande do Sul, Parana, and Santa Catharina, while\r\na small number are found in Sao Paulo and Espirito Santo in the north.\r\nThis population is, for the most part, the result of natural increase,\r\nfor of late years emigration thither has greatly declined.\r\n\r\nIn Near Asia, too, German colonization is by no means of recent origin.\r\nThere are in Transcaucasia agricultural settlements established by\r\nWuertemberg farmers, whose descendants in the third generation live in\r\ntheir own villages and still speak their native language. In Palestine,\r\nthere are the German Templar Colonies on the coast, which have prospered\r\nso well as to excite the resentment of the natives.\r\n\r\n[37] London _Morning Post_, February 1, 1912.\r\n\r\n[38] _North American Review_, March, 1912.

However much one may be\r\ntouched by such a spectacle, and pay the tribute of one's admiration to\r\nthese good men, one cannot but feel that the preaching of these high\r\nideals did not have any very immediate effect on the social progress of\r\nSouth America. What has effected this change? It is that those countries\r\nhave been brought into the economic current of the world; the bank and\r\nfactory and railroad have introduced factors and motives of a quite\r\ndifferent order from those urged by the priest, and are slowly winning\r\nthose countries from military adventure to honest work, a thing which\r\nthe preaching of high ideals failed to do.\r\n\r\n[51] \"To-day and To-morrow,\" p. 63. John Murray.\r\n\r\n[52] Since the publication of the first edition of this book there has\r\nappeared in France an admirable work by M.J. Novikow, \"Le Darwinisme\r\nSocial\" (Felix Alcan, Paris), in which this application of the Darwinian\r\ntheory to sociology is discussed with great ability, and at great length\r\nand in full detail, and the biological presentation of the case, as just\r\noutlined, has been inspired in no small part by M. Novikow's work. M.\r\nNovikow has established in biological terms what, previous to the\r\npublication of his book, I attempted to establish in economic terms.\r\n\r\n[53] Co-operation does not exclude competition. If a rival beats me in\r\nbusiness, it is because he furnishes more efficient co-operation than I\r\ndo; if a thief steals from me, he is not co-operating at all, and if he\r\nsteals much will prevent my co-operation. The organism (society) has\r\nevery interest in encouraging the competitor and suppressing the\r\nparasite.\r\n\r\n[54] Without going to the somewhat obscure analogies of biological\r\nscience, it is evident from the simple facts of the world that, if at\r\nany stage of human development warfare ever did make for the survival of\r\nthe fit, we have long since passed out of that stage. When we conquer a\r\nnation in these days, we do not exterminate it: we leave it where it\r\nwas. When we \"overcome\" the servile races, far from eliminating them, we\r\ngive them added chances of life by introducing order, etc., so that the\r\nlower human quality tends to be perpetuated by conquest by the higher.\r\nIf ever it happens that the Asiatic races challenge the white in the\r\nindustrial or military field, it will be in large part thanks to the\r\nwork of race conservation, which has been the result of England's\r\nconquest in India, Egypt, and Asia generally, and her action in China\r\nwhen she imposed commerical contact on the Chinese by virtue of military\r\npower. War between people of roughly equal development makes also for\r\nthe survival of the unfit, since we no longer exterminate and massacre a\r\nconquered race, but only their best elements (those carrying on the\r\nwar), and because the conqueror uses up _his_ best elements in the\r\nprocess, so that the less fit of both sides are left to perpetuate the\r\nspecies. Nor do the facts of the modern world lend any support to the\r\ntheory that preparation for war under modern conditions tends to\r\npreserve virility, since those conditions involve an artificial barrack\r\nlife, a highly mechanical training favorable to the destruction of\r\ninitiative, and a mechanical uniformity and centralization tending to\r\ncrush individuality, and to hasten the drift towards a centralized\r\nbureaucracy, already too great.\r\n\r\n[55] One might doubt, indeed, whether the British patriot has really the\r\nfeeling against the German that he has against his own countrymen of\r\ncontrary views. Mr. Leo Maxse, in the _National Review_ for February,\r\n1911, indulges in the following expressions, applied, not to Germans,\r\nbut to English statesmen elected by a majority of the English people:\r\nMr. Lloyd George is a \"fervid Celt animated by passionate hatred of all\r\nthings English\"; Mr. Churchill is simply a \"Tammany Hall politician,\r\nwithout, however, a Tammany man's patriotism.\" Mr. Harcourt belongs to\r\n\"that particular type of society demagogue who slangs Peers in public\r\nand fawns upon them in private.\" Mr. Leo Maxse suggests that some of the\r\nMinisters should be impeached and hanged. Mr. McKenna is Lord Fisher's\r\n\"poll-parrot,\" and the House of Commons is the \"poisonous Parliament of\r\ninfamous memory,\" in which Ministers were supported by a vast _posse\r\ncomitatus_ of German jackals.\r\n\r\n[56] Speech at Stationers' Hall, London, June 6, 1910.\r\n\r\n[57] I have in mind here the ridiculous furore that was made by the\r\nBritish Jingo Press over some French cartoons that appeared at the\r\noutbreak of the Boer War. It will be remembered that at that time France\r\nwas the \"enemy,\" and Germany was, on the strength of a speech by Mr.\r\nChamberlain, a quasi-ally. Britain was at that time as warlike towards\r\nFrance as she is now towards Germany. And this is only ten years ago!\r\n\r\n[58] In his \"History of the Rise and Influence of the Spirit of\r\nRationalism in Europe,\" Lecky says: \"It was no political anxiety about\r\nthe balance of power, but an intense religious enthusiasm that impelled\r\nthe inhabitants of Christendom towards the site which was at once the\r\ncradle and the symbol of their faith. All interests were then absorbed,\r\nall classes were governed, all passions subdued or colored, by religious\r\nfervor. National animosities that had raged for centuries were pacified\r\nby its power. The intrigues of statesmen and the jealousies of kings\r\ndisappeared beneath its influence. Nearly two million lives are said to\r\nhave been sacrificed in the cause. Neglected governments, exhausted\r\nfinances, depopulated countries, were cheerfully accepted as the price\r\nof success. No wars the world had ever before seen were so popular as\r\nthese, which were at the same time the most disastrous and the most\r\nunselfish.\"\r\n\r\n[59] \"Be assured,\" writes St. Augustine, \"and doubt not that not only\r\nmen who have obtained the use of their reason, but also little children\r\nwho have begun to live in their mother's womb and there died, or who,\r\nhaving been just born, have passed away from the world without the\r\nSacrament of Holy Baptism, must be punished by the eternal torture of\r\nundying fire.\" To make the doctrine clearer, he illustrates it by the\r\ncase of a mother who has two children. Each of these is but a lump of\r\nperdition. Neither has ever performed a moral or immoral act. The mother\r\noverlies one, and it perishes unbaptized. It goes to eternal torment.\r\nThe other is baptized and saved.\r\n\r\n[60] This appears sufficiently from the seasons in which, for instance,\r\n_autos da fe_ in Spain took place. In the Gallery of Madrid there is a\r\npainting by Francisco Rizzi representing the execution, or rather the\r\nprocession to the stake, of a number of heretics during the fetes that\r\nfollowed the marriage of Charles II., and before the King, his bride,\r\nand the Court and clergy of Madrid. The great square was arranged like a\r\ntheatre, and thronged with ladies in Court dress. The King sat on an\r\nelevated platform, surrounded by the chief members of the aristocracy.\r\n\r\nLimborch, in his \"History of the Inquisition,\" relates that among the\r\nvictims of one _auto da fe_ was a girl of sixteen, whose singular beauty\r\nstruck all who saw her with admiration. As she passed to the stake she\r\ncried to the Queen: \"Great Queen, is not your presence able to bring me\r\nsome comfort under my misery? Consider my youth, and that I am condemned\r\nfor a religion which I have sucked in with my mother's milk.\"\r\n\r\n[61] _Spectator_, December 31, 1910.\r\n\r\n[62] See quotations, pp. 161-162, from Homer Lea's book, \"The Valor of\r\nIgnorance.\"\r\n\r\n[63] Thus Captain d'Arbeux (\"L'Officier Contemporaine,\" Grasset, Paris,\r\n1911) laments \"la disparition progressive de l'ideal de revanche,\" a\r\nmilitary deterioration which is, he declares, working the country's\r\nruin. The general truth of all this is not affected by the fact that\r\n1911, owing to the Moroccan conflict and other matters, saw a revival of\r\nChauvinism, which is already spending itself. The _Matin_, December,\r\n1911, remarks: \"The number of candidates at St. Cyr and St. Maixent is\r\ndecreasing to a terrifying degree. It is hardly a fourth of what it was\r\na few years ago.... The profession of arms has no longer the attraction\r\nthat it had.\"\r\n\r\n[64] \"Germany and England,\" p. 19.\r\n\r\n[65] See the first chapter of Mr. Harbutt Dawson's admirable work, \"The\r\nEvolution of Modern Germany.\" T. Fisher Unwin, London.\r\n\r\n[66] I have excluded the \"operations\" with the Allies in China. But they\r\nonly lasted a few weeks. And were they war? This illustration appears in\r\nM. Novikow's \"Le Darwinisme Social.\"\r\n\r\n[67] The most recent opinion on evolution would go to show that\r\nenvironment plays an even larger role in the formation of character than\r\nselection (see Prince Kropotkin's article, _Nineteenth Century_, July,\r\n1910, in which he shows that experiment reveals the direct action of\r\nsurroundings as the main factor of evolution). How immensely, therefore,\r\nmust our industrial environment modify the pugnacious impulse of our\r\nnature!\r\n\r\n[68] See citations, pp. 161-166, notably Mr. Roosevelt's dictum: \"In\r\nthis world the nation that is trained to a career of unwarlike and\r\nisolated ease is bound to go down in the end before other nations which\r\nhave not lost the manly and adventurous qualities.\" This view is even\r\nemphasized in the speech which Mr. Roosevelt recently delivered at the\r\nUniversity of Berlin (see London _Times_, May 13, 1910). \"The Roman\r\ncivilization,\" declared Mr. Roosevelt--perhaps, as the _Times_ remarks,\r\nto the surprise of those who have been taught to believe that\r\n_latifundia perditere Romam_--\"went down primarily because the Roman\r\ncitizen would not fight, because Rome had lost the fighting edge.\" (See\r\nfootnote, p. 237.)\r\n\r\n[69] \"The Valor of Ignorance.\" Harpers.\r\n\r\n[70] See M. Messimy's Report on the War Budget for 1908 (annexe 3, p.\r\n474). The importance of these figures is not generally realized.\r\nAstonishing as the assertion may sound, conscription in Germany is not\r\nuniversal, while it is in France. In the latter country every man of\r\nevery class actually goes through the barracks, and is subjected to the\r\nreal discipline of military training; the whole training of the nation\r\nis purely military. This is not the case in Germany. Very nearly half of\r\nthe young men of the country are not soldiers. Another important point\r\nis that the part of the German nation which makes up the country's\r\nintellectual life escapes the barracks. To all practical purposes very\r\nnearly all young men of the better class enter the army as one year\r\nvolunteers, by which they escape more than a few weeks of barracks, and\r\neven then escape its worst features. It cannot be too often pointed out\r\nthat intellectual Germany has never been subjected to real barrack\r\ninfluence. As one critic says: \"The German system does not put this\r\nclass through the mill,\" and is deliberately designed to save them from\r\nthe grind of the mill. France's military activities since 1870 have, of\r\ncourse, been much greater than those of Germany--Tonkin, Madagascar,\r\nAlgeria, Morocco. As against these, Germany has had only the Hereros\r\ncampaign. The percentages of population given above, in the text,\r\nrequire modification as the Army Laws are modified, but the relative\r\npositions in Germany and France remain about the same.\r\n\r\n[71] _Vox de la Nacion_, Caracas, April 22, 1897.\r\n\r\n[72] Even Mr. Roosevelt calls South American history mean and bloody. It\r\nis noteworthy that, in his article published in the _Bachelor of Arts_\r\nfor March, 1896, Mr. Roosevelt, who lectured Englishmen so vigorously on\r\ntheir duty at all costs not to be guided by sentimentalism in the\r\ngovernment of Egypt, should write thus at the time of Mr. Cleveland's\r\nVenezuelan message to England: \"Mean and bloody though the history of\r\nthe South American republics has been, it is distinctly in the interest\r\nof civilization that ... they should be left to develop along their own\r\nlines.... Under the best of circumstances, a colony is in a false\r\nposition; but if a colony is a region where the colonizing race has to\r\ndo its work by means of other and inferior races, the condition is much\r\nworse.

However that may be, it is quite\r\ncertain that the physical fitness of the French people was immensely\r\nworsened by the drain of the Napoleonic wars, since, as the result of a\r\ncentury of militarism, France is compelled every few years to reduce the\r\nstandard of physical fitness in order to keep up her military strength,\r\nso that now even three-feet dwarfs are impressed.\r\n\r\n[75] I think one may say fairly that it _was_ Sydney Smith's wit rather\r\nthan Bacon's or Bentham's wisdom which killed this curious illusion.\r\n\r\n[76] See the distinction established at the beginning of the next\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n[77] M.

In spite of numerous wars, bloodshed, and\r\ndisaster, England always emerges smoothly and easily from her military\r\ncrises and settles down to new conditions and surroundings in her usual\r\ncool and deliberate manner.... Nor can one refrain from paying one's\r\ntribute to the sound qualities and character of the English aristocracy,\r\nwhich is always open to the ambitious and worthy of other classes, and\r\nthus slowly but surely widens the sphere of the middle classes by whom\r\nthey are in consequence honored and respected--a state of affairs\r\npractically unknown in Germany, but which would be to our immense\r\nadvantage.\"\r\n\r\n[84] \"Der Kaiser und die Zukunft des Deutschen Volkes.\"\r\n\r\n[85] See also the confirmatory verdict of Captain March Phillips, quoted\r\non p. 291.\r\n\r\n[86] \"My Life in the Army,\" p. 119.\r\n\r\n[87] I do not think this last generalization does any injustice to the\r\nessay, \"Latitude and Longitude among Reformers\" (\"Strenuous Life,\" pp.\r\n41-61.

Before those inventions, pictures and material images\r\nwere the chief means of religious instruction.\" And thus religious\r\nbelief became necessarily material, crude, anthropomorphic.\r\n\r\n[95] \"Battles are no longer the spectacular heroics of the past. The\r\narmy of to-day and to-morrow is a sombre gigantic machine devoid of\r\nmelodramatic heroics ... a machine that it requires years to form in\r\nseparate parts, years to assemble them together, and other years to make\r\nthem work smoothly and irresistibly\" (Homer Lea in \"The Valor of\r\nIgnorance,\" p. 49).\r\n\r\n[96] General von Bernhardi, in his work on cavalry, deals with this very\r\nquestion of the bad influence on tactics of the \"pomp of war,\" which he\r\nadmits must disappear, adding very wisely: \"The spirit of tradition\r\nconsists not in the retention of antiquated forms, but in acting in that\r\nspirit which in the past led to such glorious success.\" The plea for the\r\nretention of the soldier because of his \"spirit\" could not be more\r\nneatly disposed of. See p. 111 of the English edition of Bernhardi's\r\nwork (Hugh Rees, London).\r\n\r\n[97] See quotations, pp. 161-166.\r\n\r\n[98] The following letter to the _Manchester Guardian_, which appeared\r\nat the time of the Boer War, is worth reproduction in this connection:\r\n\r\n\"SIR,--I see that 'The Church's Duty in regard to War' is to be\r\ndiscussed at the Church Congress. This is right. For a year the heads of\r\nour Church have been telling us what war is and does--that it is a\r\nschool of character; that it sobers men, cleans them, strengthens them,\r\nknits their hearts; makes them brave, patient, humble, tender, prone to\r\nself-sacrifice. Watered by 'war's red rain,' one Bishop tells us, virtue\r\ngrows; a cannonade, he points out, is an 'oratorio'--almost a form of\r\nworship. True; and to the Church men look for help to save their souls\r\nfrom starving for lack of this good school, this kindly rain, this\r\nsacred music. Congresses are apt to lose themselves in wastes of words.\r\nThis one must not, surely cannot, so straight is the way to the goal. It\r\nhas simply to draft and submit a new Collect for war in our time, and to\r\ncall for the reverent but firm emendation, in the spirit of the best\r\nmodern thought, of those passages in Bible and Prayer-Book by which even\r\nthe truest of Christians and the best of men have at times been blinded\r\nto the duty of seeking war and ensuing it. Still, man's moral nature\r\ncannot, I admit, live by war alone; nor do I say with some that peace is\r\nwholly bad. Even amid the horrors of peace you will find little shoots\r\nof character fed by the gentle and timely rains of plague and famine,\r\ntempest and fire; simple lessons of patience and courage conned in the\r\nschools of typhus, gout, and stone; not oratorios, perhaps, but homely\r\nanthems and rude hymns played on knife and probe in the long winter\r\nnights. Far from me to 'sin our mercies,' or to call mere twilight dark.\r\nYet dark it may become; for remember that even these poor makeshift\r\nschools of character, these second-bests, these halting substitutes for\r\nwar--remember that the efficiency of every one of them, be it hunger,\r\naccident, ignorance, sickness, or pain, is menaced by the intolerable\r\nstrain of its struggles with secular doctors, plumbers, inventors,\r\nschoolmasters, and policemen. Every year thousands who would once have\r\nbeen braced and steeled by manly tussles with small-pox or diphtheria\r\nare robbed of that blessing by the great changes made in our drains.\r\nEvery year thousands of women and children must go their way bereft of\r\nthe rich spiritual experience of the widow and the orphan.\"\r\n\r\n[99] Captain March Phillips, \"With Remington.\" Methuen. See pp. 259-60\r\nfor Mr. Blatchford's confirmation of this verdict.\r\n\r\n[100] And here as to the officers--again not from me but from a very\r\nImperialist and militarist quarter--the London _Spectator_ (November 25,\r\n1911), says: \"Soldiers might be supposed to be free from pettiness\r\nbecause they are men of action. But we all know that there is no\r\nprofession in which the leaders are more depreciated by one another than\r\nin the profession of arms.\"\r\n\r\n[101] Professor William James says: \"Greek history is a panorama of war\r\nfor war's sake ... of the utter ruin of a civilization which in\r\nintellectual respects was perhaps the highest the earth has ever seen.\r\nThe wars were purely piratical. Pride, gold, women, slaves, excitement\r\nwere their only motives.\"--_McClure's Magazine_, August, 1910.\r\n\r\n[102] \"Britain at Bay.\" Constable and Co.\r\n\r\n[103] See quotation from Sir C.P. Lucas, p. 111-12.\r\n\r\n[104] See details on this matter given in Chapter VII., Part I.\r\n\r\n[105] London _Morning Post_, April 21, 1910. I pass over the fact that\r\nto cite all this as a reason for armaments is absurd. Does the _Morning\r\nPost_ really suggest that the Germans are going to attack England\r\nbecause they don't like the English taste in art, or music, or cooking?\r\nThe notion that preferences of this sort need the protection of\r\n_Dreadnoughts_ is surely to bring the whole thing within the domain of\r\nthe grotesque.\r\n\r\n[106] I refer to the remarkable speech in which Mr. Chamberlain notified\r\nFrance that she must \"mend her manners or take the consequences\" (see\r\nLondon daily papers between November 28 and December 5, 1899).\r\n\r\n[107] Not that a very great period separates us from such methods.\r\nFroude quotes Maltby's Report to Government as follows: \"I burned all\r\ntheir corn and houses, and committed to the sword all that could be\r\nfound. In like manner I assailed a castle. When the garrison\r\nsurrendered, I put them to the misericordia of my soldiers. They were\r\nall slain. Thence I went on, sparing none which came in my way, which\r\ncruelty did so amaze their fellows that they could not tell where to\r\nbestow themselves.\" Of the commander of the English forces at Munster we\r\nread: \"He diverted his forces into East Clanwilliam, and harassed the\r\ncountry; killed all mankind that were found therein ... not leaving\r\nbehind us man or beast, corn or cattle ... sparing none of what quality,\r\nage, or sex soever. Beside many burned to death, we killed man, woman,\r\nchild, horse, or beast or whatever we could find.\"\r\n\r\n[108] In \"The Evolution of Modern Germany\" (Fisher Unwin, London) the\r\nsame author says: \"Germany implies not one people, but many peoples ...\r\nof different culture, different political and social institutions ...\r\ndiversity of intellectual and economic life.... When the average\r\nEnglishman speaks of Germany he really means Prussia, and consciously or\r\nnot he ignores the fact that in but few things can Prussia be regarded\r\nas typical of the whole Empire.\"\r\n\r\n[109] \"International Law.\" John Murray, London.\r\n\r\n[110] Lord Sanderson, dealing with the development of international\r\nintercourse in an address to the Royal Society of Arts (November 15,\r\n1911), said: \"The most notable feature of recent international\r\nintercourse, he thought, was the great increase in international\r\nexhibitions, associations, and conferences of every description and on\r\nevery conceivable subject. When he first joined the Foreign Office,\r\nrather more than fifty years ago, conferences were confined almost\r\nentirely to formal diplomatic meetings to settle some urgent territorial\r\nor political question in which several States were interested. But as\r\ntime had passed, not only were the number and frequency of political\r\nconferences increased, but a host of meetings of persons more or less\r\nofficial, termed indiscriminately conferences and congresses, had come\r\ninto being.\"\r\n\r\n[111] January 8, 1910.\r\n\r\n[112] March 10, 1910.\r\n\r\n[113] \"The German Government is straining every nerve, with the zealous\r\nsupport of its people, to get ready for a fight with this country\"\r\n(_Morning Post_, March 1, 1912). \"The unsatiated will of the armed State\r\nwill, when an opportunity offers, attack most likely its most satiated\r\nneighbors without scruple, and despoil them without ruth\" (Dr. Dillon,\r\n_Contemporary Review_, October, 1911).\r\n\r\n[114] I have shown in a former chapter (Chapter VI., Part II.) how these\r\ninternational hatreds are not the cause of conflict, but the outcome of\r\nconflicts or presumed conflicts of policy. If difference of national\r\npsychology--national \"incompatibility of temper\"--were the cause, how\r\ncan we explain the fact that ten years since the English were still\r\n\"hating all Frenchmen like the devil,\" and talking of alliance with the\r\nGermans? If diplomatic shuffling had pushed England into alliance with\r\nthe Germans against the French, it would never have occurred to the\r\npeople that they had to \"detest the Germans.\"\r\n\r\n[115] The German Navy Law in its preamble might have filched this from\r\nthe British Navy League catechism.\r\n\r\n[116] In an article published in 1897 (January 16) the London\r\n_Spectator_ pointed out the hopeless position Germany would occupy if\r\nEngland cared to threaten her. The organ, which is now apt to resent the\r\nincreased German Navy as implying aggression upon England, then wrote as\r\nfollows: \"Germany has a mercantile marine of vast proportions. The\r\nGerman flag is everywhere. But on the declaration of war the whole of\r\nGermany's trading ships would be at our mercy. Throughout the seas of\r\nthe world our cruisers would seize and confiscate German ships. Within\r\nthe first week of the declaration of war Germany would have suffered a\r\nloss of many million pounds by the capture of her ships. Nor is that\r\nall. Our Colonies are dotted with German trading-houses, who, in spite\r\nof a keen competition, do a great deal of business.... We should not, of\r\ncourse, want to treat them harshly; but war must mean for them the\r\nselling of their businesses for what they would fetch and going home to\r\nGermany. In this way Germany would lose a hold upon the trade of the\r\nworld which it has taken her many years of toil to create.... Again,\r\nthink of the effect upon Germany's trade of the closing of all her\r\nports. Hamburg is one of the greatest ports of the world. What would be\r\nits condition if practically not a single ship could leave or enter it?\r\nBlockades are no doubt very difficult things to maintain strictly, but\r\nHamburg is so placed that the operation would be comparatively easy. In\r\ntruth the blockade of all the German ports on the Baltic or the North\r\nSea would present little difficulty.... Consider the effect on Germany\r\nif her flag were swept from the high seas and her ports blockaded. She\r\nmight not miss her colonies, for they are only a burden, but the loss of\r\nher sea-borne trade would be an equivalent to an immediate fine of at\r\nleast a hundred million sterling. In plain words, a war with Germany,\r\neven when conducted by her with the utmost wisdom and prudence, must\r\nmean for her a direct loss of a terribly heavy kind, and for us\r\nvirtually no loss at all.\" This article is full of the fallacies which I\r\nhave endeavored to expose in this book, but it logically develops the\r\nnotions which are prevalent in both England and Germany; and yet Germans\r\nhave to listen to an English Minister of Marine describing their Navy as\r\na luxury!\r\n\r\n[117] Here is the real English belief in this matter: \"Why should\r\nGermany attack Britain? Because Germany and Britain are commercial and\r\npolitical rivals; because Germany covets the trade, the Colonies, and\r\nthe Empire which Britain now possesses.... As to arbitration, limitation\r\nof armament, it does not require a very great effort of the imagination\r\nto enable us to see that proposal with German eyes. Were I a German, I\r\nshould say: 'These islanders are cool customers. They have fenced in all\r\nthe best parts of the globe, they have bought or captured fortresses and\r\nports in five continents, they have gained the lead in commerce, they\r\nhave a virtual monopoly of the carrying trade of the world, they hold\r\ncommand of the seas, and now they propose that we shall all be brothers,\r\nand that nobody shall fight or steal any more,'\" (Robert Blatchford,\r\n\"Germany and England,\" pp. 4-13).\r\n\r\n[118] \"Facts and Fallacies.\" An answer to \"Compulsory Service,\" by\r\nField-Marshal Earl Roberts, V.C., K.G.\r\n\r\n[119] Discussing the first edition of this book, Sir Edward Grey said:\r\n\"True as the statement in that book may be, it does not become an\r\noperative motive in the minds and conduct of nations until they are\r\nconvinced of its truth and it has become a commonplace to them\"\r\n(Argentine Centenary Banquet, May 20, 1910).\r\n\r\n[120] Lecky, \"History of the Progress of Rationalism in Europe.\"\r\n\r\n[121] I do not desire in the least, of course, to create the impression\r\nthat I regard the truths here elaborated as my \"discovery,\" as though no\r\none had worked in this field before. Properly speaking, there is no such\r\nthing as priority in ideas. The interdependence of peoples was\r\nproclaimed by philosophers three thousand years ago. The French school\r\nof pacifists--Passy, Follin, Yves Guyot, de Molinari, and Estournelles\r\nde Constant--have done splendid work in this field; but no one of them,\r\nso far as I know, has undertaken the work of testing in detail the\r\npolitico-economic orthodoxy by the principle of the economic futility of\r\nmilitary force; by bringing that principle to bear on the everyday\r\nproblems of European statecraft. If there is such an one--presenting the\r\nprecise notes of interrogation which I have attempted to present here--I\r\nam not aware of it. This does not prevent, I trust, the very highest\r\nappreciation of earlier and better work done in the cause of peace\r\ngenerally. The work of Jean de Bloch, among others, though covering\r\ndifferent ground from this, possesses an erudition and bulk of\r\nstatistical evidence to which this can make no claim. The work of J.\r\nNovikow, to my mind the greatest of all, has already been touched upon.\r\n\r\n[122] \"Turkey in Europe,\" pp. 88-9 and 91-2.\r\n\r\nIt is significant, by the way, that the \"born soldier\" has now been\r\ncrushed by a non-military race whom he has always despised as having no\r\nmilitary tradition. Capt. F.W. von Herbert (\"Bye Paths in the Balkans\")\r\nwrote (some years before the present war): \"The Bulgars, as Christian\r\nsubjects of Turkey exempt from military service, have tilled the ground\r\nunder stagnant and enfeebling peace conditions, and the profession of\r\narms is new to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stagnant and enfeebling peace conditions\" is, in view of subsequent\r\nevents, distinctly good.\r\n\r\n[123] I dislike to weary the reader with such damnable iteration, but\r\nwhen a British Cabinet Minister is unable in this discussion to\r\ndistinguish between the folly of a thing and its possibility, one _must_\r\nmake the fundamental point clear.\r\n\r\n[124] This Appendix was written before the Balkan States fell to\r\nfighting one another. It is scarcely necessary to point out that the\r\nevents of the last few days (early summer 1913) lend significance to the\r\nargument in the text.\r\n\r\n[125] See p. 390.\r\n\r\n[126] _Review of Reviews_, November, 1912.\r\n\r\n[127] In the _Daily Mail_, to whose Editor I am indebted for permission\r\nto reprint it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Acceleration, Law of, relation to sociology, 197, 220\r\n  Adam, Paul, advocate of war, 216\r\n  Aflalo, F.G., home-sickness among emigrants, 132, 133\r\n  Africa, South: gold-mines of, as motive of Boer War, 125;\r\n    position of trade in, in event of war, 126\r\n  Alsace-Lorraine, annexation of, 45-49\r\n  America. _See_ United States\r\n  America, South: financial development of, 78, 245;\r\n    folly of aggression in States of, 244;\r\n    British methods of enforcing financial obligations in, 303\r\n  Annexation: of Alsace-Lorraine and value of, to Germany, 45-49;\r\n    Alsace-Lorraine, financial aspect, 98;\r\n    Bosnia and Herzegovina, effect on Austria, 303\r\n  Arabia and internal wars, 232\r\n  Argentine international trade, 78\r\n  Aristotle: on slavery, 269;\r\n    the State, 296\r\n  Armagh, Archbishop of, advocate of war, 166\r\n  Armament, Armaments:\r\n    _United Service Magazine_ quoted on limitations of, 18;\r\n    Bernhardi school, 257;\r\n    motives of, 330;\r\n    justification of, 344\r\n  Asia Minor: protection of German interest in, 147;\r\n    benefit of, to Britain if under German tutelage, 149\r\n  Asquith, Mr.: on Canadian Navy, 113;\r\n    \"color problem,\" 116, 117\r\n  Austria, annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, 303\r\n  _Autos da fe_ in Spain, 208\r\n\r\n  Bachmar, Dr. F., on union of Germany and South Africa, 24\r\n  Bacon on nature of man, 58\r\n  Balfour, Mr. A.J., on independence of the Colonies, 114-115\r\n  Bank of England: position of, if Germany invaded England, 56-57;\r\n    helped by Bank of France, 318\r\n  Banking: Withers on interdependence necessary in, 59-61.\r\n    _See also_ Finance\r\n  Barracks, Mr. R.
