No serious attempt has yet been made to\r\nsupersede, or even adequately to supplement, the works of Coke and\r\nRichard Thomson, published respectively in 1642 and 1829, and now\r\nhopelessly out of date. This lack of enterprise may be due in part to a\r\nnatural reluctance to undertake so laborious a task, but seems also to\r\nsuggest tacit acquiescence in the opinion of Bishop Stubbs that no\r\nseparate commentary is required, since “the whole of the constitutional\r\nhistory of England is little more than a commentary on Magna Carta.”\r\nYet, for that very reason the Great Charter is surely worthy to be made\r\nthe subject of special and detailed study, since few documents can\r\ncompete with it in the variety and interest of its contents, in the\r\nvividness of its historical setting, or in the influence it has\r\nexercised on the struggle for constitutional liberty. That this\r\nconspicuous gap in our historical and legal literature should have\r\nremained so long unfilled is the more remarkable in view of the great\r\nadvance, amounting almost to a revolution, which has been effected since\r\nCoke and Thomson wrote. Within the last twenty years, in especial, a\r\nwealth of new material has been explored with notable results.\r\nDiscoveries have been made, profoundly affecting our views of every\r\nbranch of law, every organ of government, and every aspect of social and\r\nindividual life in medieval England. Nothing, however, has hitherto been\r\ndone towards applying to the systematic elucidation of Magna Carta the\r\nnew stores of knowledge thus accumulated.\r\n\r\nWith this object in view, I have endeavoured, throughout several years\r\nof hard, but congenial work, to collect, sift, and arrange the mass of\r\nevidence, drawn from many scattered sources, capable of throwing light\r\nupon John’s Great Charter. The results have now been condensed into the\r\nCommentary which fills two thirds of the present volume. This attempt to\r\nexplain, point by point, the sixty-three chapters of Magna Carta,\r\nembracing, as these do, every topic—legal, political, economic and\r\nsocial—in which John and his barons felt a vital interest, has involved\r\nan analysis in some detail of the whole public and private life of\r\nEngland during the thirteenth century. The Commentary is preceded by a\r\nHistorical Introduction, which describes the events leading to the\r\ncrisis of 1215, analyzes the grievances which stirred the barons to\r\nrevolt, discusses the contents and characteristics of the Charter,\r\ntraces its connection with the subsequent course of English history, and\r\ngives some account of previous editions and commentaries.\r\n\r\nWhile reference has been made throughout to original sources where these\r\nwere available, advantage has been freely taken of the labours of\r\nothers. If a debt of gratitude requires to be here acknowledged to\r\nprevious commentators, a far deeper debt is due to many scholars who\r\nhave, within recent years, by their labours in various fields not\r\ndirectly connected with Magna Carta, incidentally thrown light on topics\r\nof which the Charter treats. Of Bishop Stubbs it is almost unnecessary\r\nto speak, since his works form the common starting-point of all\r\nhistorians and constitutional lawyers of the present generation. Readers\r\nversed in modern literature will readily trace the influence of Prof.\r\nMaitland, Mr. J. Horace Round, Sir Frederic Pollock, Mr. L. O. Pike, and\r\nProf. Prothero; while the numerous other authorities laid under\r\ncontribution are referred to in the foot-notes and the appended\r\nbibliography. Frequent reference has been made to two independent and\r\nscholarly histories of the reign of John which have recently\r\nappeared—Miss Norgate’s _John Lackland_, and Sir James H. Ramsay’s\r\n_Angevin Empire_. Of the older books dealing directly with the subject\r\nin hand, Sir William Blackstone’s _Great Charter_ has been found the\r\nbest; while among modern works the _Chartes_ of M. Charles Bémont is the\r\nmost valuable. The inexhaustible stores of Madox’s _History of the\r\nExchequer_ have also been freely drawn upon.\r\n\r\nWhile these pages were passing through the press a brilliant essay by\r\nMr. Edward Jenks appeared in the pages of _The Independent Review_ for\r\nNovember 1904, whose title _The Myth of Magna Carta_ indicates the\r\nunconventional and iconoclastic lines on which it proceeds. He argues\r\nwith much force that the Charter was the product of the selfish action\r\nof the barons pressing their own interests, and not of any disinterested\r\nor national movement; that it was not, by any means, “a great landmark\r\nin history”; and that, instead of proving a material help in England’s\r\nadvance towards constitutional freedom, it was rather “a stumbling block\r\nin the path of progress,” being entirely feudal and reactionary in its\r\nintention and effects. Finally, for most of the popular misapprehensions\r\nconcerning it, he holds Sir Edward Coke responsible. How far the present\r\nwriter is in agreement with these opinions will appear from the\r\nfollowing pages: but Mr. Jenks’ position would seem to require\r\nmodification in at least three respects: (1) A few of the provisions of\r\nJohn’s Charter are by no means of a reactionary nature. (2) Coke cannot\r\nbe credited with the initiation of all, or even most, of the popular\r\nfallacies which have come, in the course of centuries, to cluster so\r\nthickly round the Charter. (3) Mr. Jenks, perhaps, undervalues the\r\nimportance of traditional interpretations which, even when based on\r\ninsecure historical foundations, are shown in the sequel to have proved\r\nof supreme value in the battle of freedom.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to four friends who have kindly read my proof sheets, to\r\nMr. W. R. J. Gray, and Mr. Robert A. Moody, whose good offices in this\r\ndirection are not now rendered for the first time, and to two of the\r\nmembers of my Honours Class of 1903-4, Mr. A. C. Black, Jun., and Mr. D.\r\nB. Mungo, all of whom have been zealous in help and fertile in\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n   KNIGHTSWOOD, ELDERSLIE,\r\nRENFREWSHIRE, _6th February, 1905_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CONTENTS\r\n\r\n                        HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n   PART I.

Students of its origin are sometimes content to\r\nexplain it as a mere tangible product of the successful resistance\r\ncalled forth by the tyrannies of King John. That monarch’s personal\r\nmisdeeds, it is maintained, goaded into determined action a fierce\r\nunflinching opposition which never rested until it had achieved success;\r\nand the outcome of this success was the winning of the Great Charter of\r\nLiberties. The moving causes of events of such tremendous moment are\r\nthus sought in the characteristics and vices of one man. If John had\r\nnever lived and sinned, so it would appear, the foundations of English\r\nfreedom would never have been laid.\r\n\r\nSuch shallow views of history unnecessarily belittle the magnitude and\r\ninevitable nature of the sequence of causes and effects upon which great\r\nissues really depend. The compelling logic of events forces a way for\r\nits own fulfilment, independent of the caprices, aims and ambitions of\r\nindividual men. The incidents of John’s career are the occasions, not\r\nthe causes, of the great national movement which laid the foundations of\r\nEnglish liberties. The origin of Magna Carta lies too deep to be\r\ndetermined by any purely contingent or accidental phenomena. It is as\r\nunwise as it is unnecessary to suppose that the course of constitutional\r\ndevelopment in England was suddenly and violently wrested into a\r\ncompletely new channel, merely because of the incapacity or misdeeds of\r\nthe temporary occupant of the throne. The source of the discontent\r\nfanned to flame by John’s oppressions must be sought in earlier reigns.\r\nThe genesis of the Charter cannot be understood apart from its\r\nhistorical antecedents, and these are inextricably bound up with the\r\nwhole story how England grew to be a nation.\r\n\r\nIn expounding the origin of the Charter, it is necessary briefly to\r\nnarrate how the scattered Anglo-Saxon and Danish tribes and territories,\r\noriginally unconnected, were gradually welded together and grew into\r\nEngland; how this fusion was made permanent by the growth of a strong\r\nform of centralized monarchical government which crushed out all\r\nattempts at local independence, and threatened to become the most\r\nabsolute despotism in Europe; and how, finally, the Crown, because of\r\nthe very plenitude of its power, challenged opposition and called into\r\nplay forces which set limits to royal prerogatives and royal\r\naggressions, and at the same time laid the foundations of the reign of\r\nlaw. A short survey of the early history of England forms a necessary\r\npreliminary to a right understanding of Magna Carta. Such a survey makes\r\nprominent two leading movements, one of which succeeds the other;\r\nnamely, the establishment of a strong monarchy able to bring order out\r\nof anarchy, and the subsequent establishment of safeguards to prevent\r\nthis source of order degenerating into an unrestrained tyranny, and so\r\ncrushing out not merely anarchy but legitimate freedom as well. The\r\nlater movement, in favour of liberty and the Great Charter, was the\r\nnatural complement, and, in part, the consequence of the earlier\r\nmovement in the direction of a strong government able to enforce peace.\r\nIn historical sequence, order precedes freedom.\r\n\r\nThese two problems, each forming the counterpart of the other,\r\nnecessarily arise in the history of every nation, and in every age; the\r\nproblem of _order_, or how to found a central government strong enough\r\nto suppress anarchy, and the problem of _freedom_, or how to set limits\r\nto an autocracy threatening to overshadow individual liberty. Neither of\r\nthese problems can ever be ignored, not even in the twentieth century;\r\nalthough to-day the accumulated political experience of ages has enabled\r\nmodern nations, such at least as are sufficiently educated in\r\nself-government, to thrust them into the background, out of view. Deep\r\npolitical insight may still be acknowledged in Æsop’s fable of Jupiter\r\nand the frogs. King Log proves as ineffective against foreign invasion\r\nas he is void of offence to domestic freedom; King Stork secures the\r\ntriumph of his subjects in time of war, but devours them in time of\r\npeace. All nations in their early efforts to obtain an efficient\r\ngovernment have to choose between these two types of ruler—between an\r\nexecutive, harmless but weak; and one powerful enough effectively to\r\ndirect the business of government at home and abroad, but ready to turn\r\nthe powers entrusted to him for the good of all, to his own selfish uses\r\nand the trampling out of his subjects’ liberties.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the miseries of the long centuries of Anglo-Saxon rule\r\nwere mainly the outcome of the Crown’s weakness; while, at the Norman\r\nConquest, England escaped from the mild sceptre of inefficiency, only to\r\nfall under the cruel sceptre of selfish strength. Yet the able kings of\r\nthe new dynasty, powerful as they were, had to struggle in order to\r\nmaintain their supremacy; for, although the conquered English races were\r\nincapable of concerted resistance against their Norman masters, the\r\nunruly alien barons fought vigorously to shake off the royal control.\r\n\r\nDuring a century of Norman rule, constant warfare was waged between two\r\ngreat principles—the monarchic standing on the whole for order, seeking\r\nto crush anarchy, and the oligarchic or baronial, standing on the whole\r\nfor liberty, protesting against the tyranny of autocratic power.\r\nSometimes one of these was in the ascendant; sometimes the other. The\r\nhistory of medieval England is the swing of the pendulum between these\r\ntwo extremes.\r\n\r\nThe main plot, then, of early English history, centres round the attempt\r\nto found a strong monarchy, and yet to set limits to its strength. With\r\nthis main plot subordinate plots are interwoven. Chief among these must\r\nbe reckoned the necessity of defining the relations of the central to\r\nthe local government, and the need of an acknowledged frontier between\r\nthe domains of Church and State. On the other hand, all that interesting\r\ngroup of problems connected with the _ideal form_ of government, much\r\ndiscussed in the days of Aristotle as in our own, is notably absent,\r\nnever having been forced by the logic of events upon the mind of\r\nmedieval Europe. Monarchy was apparently assumed as the only possible\r\nscheme of government; while the relative merits of aristocracy and\r\ndemocracy, or of the much-vaunted constitution known as “mixed,” were\r\nnot canvassed, since these forms of constitution were not within the\r\nsphere of practical politics.\r\n\r\nThe student of history will do well to concentrate his attention at\r\nfirst on the main problem, while viewing the subsidiary ones in their\r\nrelations to the central current.\r\n\r\n         I. William I. to Henry II.—Main Problem: the Monarchy.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the most casual student is arrested by the\r\nconsideration of the difficulties which surrounded the English nation in\r\nits early struggles for bare existence. The great problem was, first,\r\nhow to get itself into being, and thereafter how to guard against the\r\nforces of disintegration, which strove without rest to tear it to pieces\r\nagain. The dawn of English history shows the beginning of that long slow\r\nprocess of consolidation in which unconscious reason played a deeper\r\npart than human will, whereby many discordant tribes and races, many\r\nindependent provinces, were crushed together into something bearing a\r\nrude likeness to a united nation. Many forces converged in achieving\r\nthis result. The coercion of strong tribes over their weaker neighbours,\r\nthe pressure of outside foes, the growth of a body of law, and of public\r\nopinion, the influence of religion in the direction of peace, all helped\r\nto weld a chaos of incongruous and warring elements together.\r\n\r\nIt is notable that each of the three influences, destined ultimately to\r\naid most materially in this process of unification, threatened at one\r\ntime to have a contrary effect. Thus the rivalries of the smaller\r\nkingdoms tended at first towards a complete disruption, before Wessex\r\nsucceeded in asserting an undisputed supremacy; the Christianizing of\r\nEngland partly by Celtic missionaries from the north and partly by\r\nemissaries from Rome threatened to split the country into two, until\r\ntheir mutual rivalries were stilled after the Synod of Whitby in 664;\r\nand one effect of the incursion of the Danes was to create an absolute\r\nbarrier between the lands that lay on either side of Watling Street,\r\nbefore the whole country succumbed to the unifying pressure of Cnut and\r\nhis sons.\r\n\r\nThe stern discipline of foreign conquest was required to make national\r\nunity possible; and, with the restoration of the old Wessex dynasty in\r\nthe person of Edward Confessor, the forces of disintegration again made\r\nheadway. England threatened once more to fall to pieces, but at the\r\ncritical and appointed time the iron rule of the Normans came to\r\ncomplete what the Danes had begun half a century earlier. As the\r\nweakness of the Anglo-Saxon kings and the disruption of the country had\r\ngone hand in hand, so the process which, after the Conquest, made\r\nEngland one, was identical with the process which established the throne\r\nof the new dynasty on a strong, enduring basis. The complete unification\r\nof England was the result of the Norman despotism.\r\n\r\nThereafter, the strength of its monarchy was what rendered England\r\nunique in medieval Europe. Three great kings in especial contributed, by\r\ntheir ability and indomitable power of will, to this result—William the\r\nConqueror, Henry Beauclerk, and Henry Plantagenet. In a sense, the work\r\nof all three was the same, namely, to build up the central authority\r\nagainst the disintegrating effects of feudal anarchy; but the policy of\r\neach was necessarily modified by changing times and needs. The\r\nfoundations of the whole were laid by the Conqueror, whose character and\r\ncircumstances combined to afford him an opportunity unparalleled in\r\nhistory. The difficulties of his task, and the methods by which he\r\ncarried it to a successful issue, are best understood in relation to the\r\nnature of the opposition he had to dread. Feudalism was the great\r\ncurrent of the age—a tide formed by many converging streams, all flowing\r\nin the same direction, unreasoning like the blind powers of Nature,\r\ncarrying away and submerging every obstacle in its path. In other parts\r\nof Europe—in Germany, France, and Italy, as in Scotland—the ablest\r\nmonarchs found their thrones undermined by this feudal current. In\r\nEngland alone the monarchy made headway against the flood. William I.\r\nwisely refrained from any mad attempt to stay the torrent; but, while\r\naccepting it, he quietly subjected it to his own purposes. He carefully\r\nwatched and modified the tendencies making for feudalism, which he found\r\nin England on his arrival, and he profoundly altered the feudal usages\r\nand rights which his followers transplanted from the Norman soil. The\r\nspecial expedients used by him for this purpose are well known, and are\r\nall closely connected with his crafty policy of balancing the\r\nAnglo-Saxon basis of his rule against the imported Norman\r\nsuperstructure, and of selecting at his own discretion such elements as\r\nsuited him in either. He encouraged the adoption or intensification in\r\nEngland of feudalism, considered as a system of land tenure and as a\r\nsystem of social distinctions based on the possession of land; but he\r\nsuccessfully endeavoured to check the evils of its unrestrained growth\r\nin its other equally important aspects, namely, as a system of local\r\ngovernment seeking to be independent of the Crown, and as a system of\r\njurisdiction. As a political system, it was always a subject of\r\nsuspicion to William, for he viewed it in the light of his double\r\nexperience in Normandy as feudal lord and feudal vassal.\r\n\r\nWilliam’s policy was one of balancing. His whole career in England was\r\ncharacteristically inaugurated by his care to support his claim to the\r\nthrone on a double basis. Not content to depend merely on the right of\r\nconquest, he insisted on having his title confirmed by a body claiming\r\nto represent the old Witenagemot of England, and he further alleged that\r\nhe had been formally named as successor by his kinsman, Edward\r\nConfessor, a nomination strengthened by the renunciation of Harold in\r\nhis favour. Thus, to his Norman followers claiming to have set him by\r\nforce of arms on his throne, William might point to the form of election\r\nby the Witan, while for his English subjects, claiming to have elected\r\nhim, the presence of the foreign troops was an even more effective\r\nargument. Throughout his reign, his plan was to balance the old English\r\nlaws and institutions against the new Norman ones, with himself as\r\numpire over all. Thus he retained whatever suited him in Anglo-Saxon\r\ncustoms. Roger of Hoveden tells us how, in the fourth year of his reign,\r\ntwelve of the subject English from each county—noble, wise, and learned\r\nin the laws—were summoned to recite on oath the old customs of the\r\nland.[1] He retained, too, the old popular moots or meetings of the\r\nshire and hundred as a counterpoise to the feudal jurisdictions; the\r\nfyrd or militia of all free men as a set-off to the feudal levy; and\r\nsuch of the incidents of the old Anglo-Saxon tenures of land as met his\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  R. Hoveden, _Chronica_, II. 218.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThus the subject English, with their customs and ancient institutions,\r\nwere used as expedients for modifying the excesses of feudalism.\r\nWilliam, however, did not shrink from innovations where these suited his\r\npurpose. The great earldoms into which England had been divided, even\r\ndown to the Norman Conquest, were abolished. New earldoms were indeed\r\ncreated, but on an entirely different basis. Even the great officers,\r\nsubsequently known as Earls Palatine, always few in number, never\r\nattained either to the extent of territory or to the independence of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon ealdormen. William was chary of creating even ordinary\r\nearls, and such as he did create soon became mere holders of empty\r\ntitles of honour, while they found themselves ousted from all real power\r\nby the Norman _vicecomites_ or sheriffs. No English earl was a “count”\r\nin the continental sense (that is, a real ruler of a “county”). Further,\r\nno earl was allowed to hold too large an estate within his titular\r\nshire; and William, while compelled to reward his followers’ services\r\nwith great possessions, was careful that these should be split up in\r\nwidely scattered districts of his Kingdom. Thus the great feudatories\r\nwere prevented from consolidating their resources against the Crown.\r\n\r\nVarious ingenious devices were used for checking the feudal excesses so\r\nprevalent on the continent. Rights of private war, coinage, and\r\ncastle-building, were jealously watched and circumscribed; while private\r\njurisdictions, although tolerated as a necessary evil, were kept within\r\nbounds. The manor was in England the normal unit of seignorial\r\njurisdiction, and higher courts of Honours were so exceptional as to be\r\na negligible quantity. No feudal appeal lay from the manorial court of\r\none magnate to that of his over-lord, while, in later reigns at least,\r\nappeals were encouraged to the _Curia Regis_. Almost at the close of\r\nWilliam’s reign a new encroachment upon the feudal spirit was\r\naccomplished, when the Conqueror on Salisbury Plain compelled all\r\nfreeholders to take an oath of homage and fealty personally to the king.\r\n\r\nThe results of this policy have been well summarized as “a strong\r\nmonarchy, a relatively weak baronage, and a homogeneous people.”\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of William II. (1087-1100) the constitution made no\r\nconspicuous advance. The foundations had been laid; but Rufus was more\r\nintent on his hunting and enjoyments, than on the deeper matters of\r\nstatecraft. Some minor details of feudal organization were doubtless\r\nsettled and defined in these thirteen years by the King’s Treasurer,\r\nRalph Flambard; but the extent to which he innovated on the practice of\r\nthe elder William is matter of dispute. On the whole, the reign must be\r\nconsidered as a time of rest between two periods of advance.\r\n\r\nHenry I. (1100-35) took up, with far-seeing statesman’s eye and much\r\nvigour, the work of consolidation. His policy shows an advance upon that\r\nof his father. William had contented himself with controlling and\r\ncurbing the main vices of feudalism, while he played off against it the\r\nEnglish native institutions. Henry went further, and introduced within\r\nthe _Curia Regis_ itself a new class of men representing a new principle\r\nof government. The great offices of state, previously held by men of\r\nbaronial rank, were now filled with creatures of Henry’s own, men of\r\nhumble birth, whose merit had raised them to his favour, and whose only\r\ntitle to power lay in his goodwill. The employment of this strictly\r\nprofessional class of administrators was one of the chief contributions\r\nmade by Henry to the growth of the constitution. His other great\r\nachievement was the organization of the Exchequer, primarily as a source\r\nof royal revenue, but soon found useful as a means of making his will\r\nfelt in every corner of England. For this great work he was fortunate to\r\nsecure in Roger, Bishop of Salisbury, the help of a man who combined\r\ngenius with painstaking ability. At the Exchequer, as organized by the\r\nKing and his minister, the sheriff of each county twice a year, at\r\nEaster and at Michaelmas, rendered account of every payment that had\r\npassed through his hands. His balance was adjusted before all the great\r\nofficers of the King’s household, who subjected his accounts to close\r\nscrutiny and criticism. Official records were drawn up, one of which—the\r\nfamous Pipe Roll of 1130,—is extant at the present day. As the sums\r\nreceived by the sheriff affected every class of society in town and\r\ncountry, these half-yearly audits enabled the King’s advisers to\r\nscrutinize the lives and conduct of every one of importance in the land.\r\nThese half-yearly investigations were rendered more effective by the\r\nexistence at the Exchequer of a great record of every landed estate in\r\nEngland. With this the sheriffs’ returns could be checked and compared.\r\nHenry’s Exchequer thus found one of its most powerful weapons in the\r\ngreat Domesday Survey, the most enduring proof of the statesmanship of\r\nthe Conqueror, by whose orders and under whose direction it had been\r\ncompiled.\r\n\r\nThe central scrutiny conducted within the two chambers of the Exchequer\r\nwas supplemented by occasional inspections conducted in each county. The\r\nKing’s representatives, including among them usually some of the\r\nofficers whose duty it was to preside over the half-yearly audit,\r\nvisited, at intervals still irregular, the various shires. These Eyres,\r\nas they were called, were at first chiefly undertaken for financial\r\npurposes. The main object was to check, on the scene of their labours,\r\nthe statements made at Westminster by the various sheriffs. From the\r\nfirst, such financial investigations necessarily involved the trial of\r\npleas. Complaints of oppression at the hands of the local tyrant of the\r\ncounty were naturally made and determined on the spot; gradually, but\r\nnot until a later reign, the judicial business became equally important\r\nwith the financial, and ultimately even more important.\r\n\r\nHenry at his death in 1135 seemed to have carried nearly to completion\r\nhis congenial task of building a strong monarchy on the foundations laid\r\nby William I. Much of his work was, however, for a time undone, while\r\nall of it seemed in imminent danger of perishing for ever, because he\r\nleft no male heir of his body to succeed him on the throne. His\r\ndaughter’s claims were set aside by Stephen, the son of the Conqueror’s\r\ndaughter, and a cadet of the House of Blois, to whom Henry had played\r\nthe indulgent uncle, and who repaid his benefactor’s generosity by\r\nconstituting himself his heir. From the first moment of his reign,\r\nStephen proved unequal to the task of preserving the monarchy intact\r\nfrom the wild forces that beat around the throne. His failure is\r\nattributed by some to his personal characteristics, and by others to the\r\ndefective nature of his title, combined with the presence of a rival in\r\nthe field in the person of his cousin, Henry’s daughter, the ex-Empress\r\nMatilda. The nineteen years of anarchy which nominally formed his reign\r\ndid nothing—and worse than nothing—to continue the work of his great\r\nancestors. The power of the Crown was humbled, and England was almost\r\ntorn in fragments by the selfish claims of rival feudal magnates to\r\nlocal independence.\r\n\r\nWith the accession of Henry II. (1154) the tide quickly turned, and\r\nturned for good.\r\n\r\nOf the numerous steps taken by Henry Plantagenet to complete the work of\r\nthe earlier master-builders of the English monarchy, only a few need\r\nhere be mentioned. Ascending the throne in early manhood, he brought\r\nwith him a statesman’s instinct peculiar to himself, together with the\r\nunconquerable energy common to his race. He rapidly overhauled every\r\nexisting institution and every branch of administration. The permanent\r\n_Curia Regis_ was not only restored to efficient working order, but was\r\nimproved in each one of its many aspects—as the King’s household, as a\r\nfinancial bureau, as the administrative centre of the entire kingdom,\r\nand as the special vehicle of royal justice. The Exchequer, which was\r\nindeed originally merely the _Curia_ in its financial aspect, received\r\nthe re-organization so urgently needed after the terrible strains to\r\nwhich it had been subjected amid the quarrels of Stephen and Matilda.\r\nThe Pipe Rolls were revived and various minor reforms in financial\r\nmatters effected. All local courts (both the old popular courts of\r\nhundred and county, and also the feudal jurisdictions) were brought\r\nunder the more effective control of the central government by various\r\nexpedients. Chief among these was the restoration of the system of Eyres\r\nwith their travelling justices (a natural supplement to the restoration\r\nof the Exchequer), whose visits were now placed on a more regular and\r\nsystematic basis. Equally important were the King’s personal care in the\r\nselection of fit men for the duties of sheriff, the frequent punishments\r\nand removal from office of offenders, and the rigid insistence upon\r\nefficient training and uprightness in all who enjoyed places of\r\nauthority under the Crown. Henry was strong enough to employ more\r\nsubstantial men than the _novi homines_ of his grandfather without\r\nsuffering them to be less devoted to the interests of their Prince. Yet\r\nanother expedient for controlling local courts was the calling up of\r\ncases to his own central feudal _Curia_, or before those benches of\r\nprofessional judges, the future King’s Bench and Common Pleas, forming\r\nas yet merely committees of the _Curia_ as a whole.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with the control thus established over the local\r\ncourts was the new system of procedure instituted by Henry. The chief\r\nfeature was that each litigation must commence with an appropriate royal\r\nwrit issued from the Chancery. Soon for each class of action was devised\r\na special writ appropriate to itself, and the entire procedure came to\r\nbe known as \"the writ process\"—an important system to which English\r\njurisprudence owes both its form and the direction of its growth. Many\r\nreforms which at first sight seem connected merely with minute points of\r\nlegal procedure were really fraught with immense purport to the\r\nsubsequent development of English law and English liberties. A great\r\nfuture was reserved for certain expedients adopted by Henry for the\r\nsettlement of disputes as to the possession or ownership of land, and\r\nalso for certain expedients for reforming criminal justice instituted or\r\nsystematized by a great ordinance, issued in 1166, known as the Assize\r\nof Clarendon.[2] A striking feature of Henry’s policy was the bold\r\nmanner in which he threw open the doors of his royal Courts of Law to\r\nall-comers, and provided there—always in return for hard cash, be it\r\nsaid—a better article in name of justice than could be procured\r\nelsewhere in England, or for that matter, elsewhere in Europe. Thus, not\r\nonly was the Exchequer filled with fines and fees, but, insidiously and\r\nwithout the danger involved in a frontal attack, Henry sapped the\r\nstrength of the great feudal magnates, and diverted the stream of\r\nlitigants from the manorial courts to his own. The same policy had still\r\nanother result in facilitating the growth of a body of common law,\r\nuniform throughout the length and breadth of England, and opposed to the\r\nvarying usages of localities or even of individual baronial courts.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  The details of these reforms are fully discussed _infra_ under the\r\n  head of “Royal Justice and Feudal Justice,” and some of their ultimate\r\n  effects under the head of “Trial by Jury.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThese reforms, besides influencing the current of events in England in\r\nnumerous ways, both direct and indirect, all helped to strengthen the\r\nthrone of Henry and his sons. Another class of reforms contributed\r\ngreatly to the same result, namely, the reorganization of the army. This\r\nwas effected in various ways: partly by the revival and more strict\r\nenforcement of the obligations connected with the old Anglo-Saxon fyrd\r\nor militia, under the Assize of Arms in 1181, which compelled every\r\nfreeman to maintain at his own expense weapons and warlike equipment\r\nsuited to his station in life; partly by the ingenious method of\r\nincreasing the amount of feudal service due from Crown tenants, based\r\nupon an investigation instituted by the Crown and upon the written\r\nreplies returned by the barons, known to historians as “the _Cartae_ of\r\n1166”; and partly by the development (not, as is usually supposed, the\r\n_invention_) of the principle of scutage, a means whereby unwilling\r\nmilitary service, limited as it was by annoying restrictions as to time\r\nand place, might be exchanged at the option of the Crown for money, with\r\nwhich a more flexible army of mercenaries might be hired.\r\n\r\nBy these expedients, along with many others, Henry raised the English\r\nmonarchy, always in the ascendant since the Conquest, to the very zenith\r\nof its power, and left to his sons the entire machinery of government in\r\nperfect working order, combining high administrative efficiency with\r\ngreat strength. Full of bitter strifes and troubles as his reign of\r\nthirty-five years had been, nothing had interfered with the vigour and\r\nsuccess of the policy whereby he tightened his hold on England. Neither\r\nthe long bitter struggle with Becket and the Church, ending as it did in\r\nHenry’s personal humiliation, nor the unnatural warfare with his sons,\r\nwhich involved the depths of personal suffering to the King and hastened\r\nhis death in 1189, was allowed to interfere with his projects of reform\r\nin England.\r\n\r\nThe last twenty years of his life had been darkened for him, and proved\r\ntroubled and anarchic in the extreme to his continental dominions; but\r\nin England profound peace reigned. The last serious revolt of the powers\r\nof feudal anarchy had been suppressed in 1173 with characteristic\r\nthoroughness and moderation. After that date, the English monarchy\r\nretained its supremacy almost without an effort.\r\n\r\n        II. William I. to Henry II.—Problem of Local Government.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to leave for a time the English monarchy at its zenith,\r\nstill enjoying in 1189 the powers and reputation gained for it by Henry\r\nof Anjou, and to retrace our steps, in order to consider two subsidiary\r\nproblems, each of which requires separate treatment—the problem of local\r\ngovernment, and that of the relations between Church and State. The\r\nfailure of the Princes of the House of Wessex to devise adequate\r\nmachinery for keeping the Danish and Anglian provinces in subjection to\r\ntheir will was one main source of the weakness of their monarchy. When\r\nDuke William solved this problem he took an enormous stride towards\r\nestablishing his throne on a securer basis.\r\n\r\nEvery age has to face, in its own way, a group of difficulties\r\nessentially the same, although assuming such different names as Home\r\nRule, Local Government, or Federation. Problems as to the proper nature\r\nof the local authority, the extent of the powers with which it may be\r\nsafely entrusted, and its relation to the central government, require\r\nconstantly to be solved. The difficulties involved, always great, were\r\nunspeakably greater in an age when practically no administrative\r\nmachinery existed, and when rapid communication and serviceable roads\r\nwere unknown. A lively sympathy is excited by a consideration of the\r\nalmost insuperable difficulties that beset the path of King Edgar or\r\nKing Ethelred, endeavouring to rule from Winchester the distant tribes\r\nof alien races inhabiting Northumbria, Mercia, and East Anglia. If such\r\na king placed a weakling as ruler over any distant province, anarchy\r\nwould result and his own authority might be endangered along with that\r\nof his inefficient representative. Yet, if he entrusted the rule of that\r\nprovince to too strong a man, he might find his suzerainty shaken off by\r\na viceroy who had consolidated his position and then defied his king.\r\nHere, then, are the two horns of a dilemma, both of which are\r\nillustrated by the course of early English history. When Wessex had\r\nestablished some measure of authority over rival states, and was fast\r\ngrowing into England, the policy at first followed was simply to leave\r\neach province under its old native line of rulers, who now admitted a\r\nnominal dependence on the King who ruled at Winchester. The early\r\nWest-Saxon Princes vacillated between two opposite lines of policy.\r\nSpasmodic attempts at centralization alternated with the reverse policy\r\nof local autonomy. In the days when Dunstan united the spiritual duties\r\nof the See of Canterbury to the temporal duties of chief adviser to King\r\nEdgar, the problem of local government became urgent. Dunstan’s scheme\r\nhas sometimes been described as a federal or home-rule policy—as a frank\r\nsurrender of the attempt to control exclusively from one centre the\r\nmixed populations of Northern and Midland England. His attempted\r\nsolution was to loosen rather than to tighten further the bond; to\r\nentrust with wide powers and franchises the local viceroy or ealdorman\r\nin each district, and so to be content with a loose federal empire—a\r\nunion of hearts rather than a centralized despotism founded on coercion.\r\nThe dangers of such a system are the more obvious when it is remembered\r\nthat each ealdorman commanded the troops of his own province.\r\n\r\nCnut’s policy has been the subject of much discussion, and has sometimes\r\napparently been misunderstood. The better opinion is that, with his\r\nDanish troops behind him, he felt strong enough to reverse Dunstan’s\r\ntactics and to take a decisive step in the direction of centralization\r\nor unity. His provincial viceroys (jarls or earls, as they were now\r\ncalled, rather than by their old vague title of ealdormen), were\r\nappointed on an entirely new basis. England was to be mapped out into\r\nnew administrative districts in the hope of obliterating the old tribal\r\ndivisions. Each of these was to be placed under a viceroy having no\r\nhereditary or dynastic connection with the province he governed. In this\r\nway, Cnut sought to avert the process by which the country was slowly\r\nbreaking up into a number of petty kingdoms.\r\n\r\nIf these viceroys were a source of strength to the powerful Cnut, they\r\nwere a source of weakness to the saintly Confessor, who was forced to\r\nsubmit to the control of his provincial rulers, such as Godwin and\r\nLeofric, as each in turn gained the upper hand in the field or in the\r\nWitan. This process of disintegration continued until the coming of the\r\nConqueror utterly changed the relations of the monarchy to every other\r\nfactor in the national life.\r\n\r\nAmong the expedients adopted by the Norman Duke for reducing his\r\nfeudatories in England into subjection to the Crown, one of the most\r\nimportant was the total abolition of the old provinces formerly governed\r\nby separate ealdormen or jarls. Leaving out of account the exceptional\r\nfranchises, afterwards known as palatine earldoms, the real\r\nrepresentative of the King in each group of counties was now the sheriff\r\nor _vicecomes_, not the earl. This Latin name of _vicecomes_ is\r\nmisleading, since the officer so-called in no sense represented the earl\r\nor _comes_, but acted as the direct agent of the Crown. The name,\r\n“viceroy,” more accurately describes his actual position and functions,\r\nsince he was directly responsible to the Crown, and independent of the\r\nearl. The problem of local government, however, was not eradicated by\r\nthe substitution of the sheriff for the earl as chief magistrate in the\r\ncounty; it only took a different form. The sheriffs themselves, when\r\nrelieved from the earl’s rivalry and control, tended to become too\r\npowerful. If they never dreamed of openly defying the royal power, they\r\nat least thwarted its exercise indirectly, appropriated to their private\r\nuses items of revenue, pushed their own interests, and punished their\r\nown enemies, while acting in the name of the King. The office threatened\r\nto become territorial and hereditary,[3] and its holders aimed at\r\nindependence. New checks had to be devised to prevent this new local\r\nauthority from again defying the central power. New safeguards were\r\nfound, partly in the organization of the Exchequer and partly in the\r\ndevice of sending periodically on circuit itinerant justices, who took\r\nprecedence of the sheriff, heard complaints against his misdeeds in his\r\nown county, and thus enabled the Crown to keep a watchful eye on its\r\nrepresentatives. By such measures, Henry I. seemed almost to have solved\r\nthese problems before his death; but his success was apparent rather\r\nthan real.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  In one county, Westmoreland, the office did become hereditary.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe incompleteness of Henry’s solution of the difficulty became evident\r\nunder Stephen, when the leading noble of each locality tried, generally\r\nwith success, to capture _both_ offices for himself; great earls like\r\nRalph of Chester and Geoffrey of Essex compelled the King not only to\r\nconfirm them as sheriffs in their own titular counties, but also to\r\nconfer on them exclusive right to act as justices therein.\r\n\r\nWith the accession of Henry II. the problem was, thanks to his energy\r\nand genius, more satisfactorily solved, or at least forced once more\r\ninto the background. That great ruler was strong enough to prevent the\r\ngrowth of the hereditary principle as applied to offices either of the\r\nHousehold or of local magistrates. The sheriffs were frequently changed,\r\nnot only by the drastic and unique measure known as the Inquest of\r\nSheriffs, but systematically, and as a normal expedient of\r\nadministration. For the time being, the local government was kept in\r\nproper subjection to the Crown; and gradually the problem solved itself.\r\nThe power of the sheriffs tended in the thirteenth century to decrease,\r\nchiefly because they found important rivals not only in the itinerant\r\njudges, but also in two new officers first heard of in the reign of\r\nRichard I., the forerunners of the modern Coroner and Justice of the\r\nPeace respectively. All fear that the sheriffs as administrative heads\r\nof districts would assert practical independence of the Crown was thus\r\nat an end. Yet each of them still remained a petty tyrant over the\r\ninhabitants of his own bailiwick. While the Crown was able and willing\r\nto avenge any direct neglect of its own interests, it was not always\r\nsufficiently alert to avenge wrongs inflicted upon its humble subjects.\r\nThe problem of local government, then, was fast losing its pressing\r\nimportance as regards the Crown, and taking a new form, namely, the\r\nnecessity of protecting the weak from unjust fines and oppressions\r\ninflicted on them by local magistrates. The sheriff’s local power was no\r\nlonger a source of weakness to the monarch, but had become an effective\r\npart of the machinery which enabled the Crown to levy with impunity its\r\nalways increasing taxation.\r\n\r\n       III. William I. to Henry II.—Problem of Church and State.\r\n\r\nThe national Church had been, from an early date, in tacit alliance with\r\nthe Crown. The friendly aid of a long line of statesman-prelates from\r\nDunstan downwards had given to the Anglo-Saxon monarchy much of the\r\nlittle strength it possessed. Before the Conquest the connection between\r\nChurch and State had been exceedingly close, so much so that no one\r\nthought of drawing a sharp dividing line between. What afterwards became\r\ntwo separate entities, drifting more and more into active opposition,\r\nwere at first merely two aspects of one whole—a whole which comprehended\r\nall classes of the people, considered both in their spiritual and their\r\ntemporal relations. Change necessarily came with the Norman Conquest,\r\nwhen the English Church was brought into closer contact with Rome, and\r\nwith the ecclesiastical ideals prevailing on the Continent. Yet no\r\nfundamental alteration resulted; the friendly relations which bound the\r\nEnglish prelates to the English throne remained intact, while English\r\nchurchmen continued to look to Canterbury, rather than to Rome, for\r\nguidance. The Church, in William the Conqueror’s new realm, retained\r\nmore of a national character than could be found in any other nation of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nGratitude to the Pope for his moral support in the work of the Conquest\r\nnever modified William’s determination to allow no unwarranted papal\r\ninterference in his new domains. His letter, both outspoken and\r\ncourteous, in reply to papal demands is still extant. “I refuse to do\r\nfealty nor will I, because neither have I promised it, nor do I find\r\nthat my predecessors did it to your predecessors.” Peter’s pence he was\r\nwilling to pay at the rate recognized by his Saxon predecessors; but all\r\nencroachments would be politely repelled.\r\n\r\nIn settling the country newly reduced to his domination, the Duke of\r\nNormandy found his most valuable adviser in a former Abbot of the Norman\r\nAbbey of Bec, whom he raised to be Primate of all England. No record has\r\ncome down to us of any serious dispute between William and Lanfranc.\r\n\r\nSubstantially friendly relations between their successors in the offices\r\nof King and Archbishop remained, notwithstanding Anselm’s condemnation\r\nof the evil deeds of Rufus. Anselm warmly supported that King’s\r\nauthority over the Norman magnates, even while he resented his evil\r\npractices towards the Church. He contented himself with a dignified\r\nprotest (made emphatic by a withdrawal of his presence from England)\r\nagainst the new exactions upon the English prelates, and against the\r\nlong intervals during which vacancies remained unfilled. Returning at\r\nRufus’s death from a sort of honourable banishment at Rome, to aid Henry\r\nin maintaining order and gaining peaceable accession to the throne,\r\nAnselm found himself compelled by his conscience and the recent decrees\r\nof a Lateran Council, to enter on the great struggle of the\r\ninvestitures. Church and State were gradually disentangling themselves\r\nfrom each other; but in many respects the spiritual and temporal powers\r\nwere still indissolubly locked together. In particular, every bishop was\r\na vassal of the king, holder of a Crown barony, as well as a prelate of\r\nHoly Church. By whom, then, should a bishop be appointed, by the\r\nspiritual or by the temporal power? Could he without sin perform homage\r\nfor the estates of his See? Who ought to invest him with ring and\r\ncrozier, the symbols of his office as a shepherd of souls? Anselm\r\nadopted one view, Henry the other. A happy compromise, suggested by the\r\nKing’s statesmanship, healed the breach for the time being. The ring and\r\ncrozier, as badges of spiritual authority, were to be conferred only by\r\nthe Church, but each prelate must perform fealty to the King before\r\nreceiving these symbols, and must do homage thereafter, but before he\r\nwas actually anointed as bishop. Canonical election was nominally\r\nconceded by the King; but here again a practical check was devised for\r\nrendering this power innocuous. The members of the cathedral chapter\r\nwere confirmed in the theoretic right to appoint whom they pleased, but\r\nsuch appointment must be made in the King’s Court or Chapel, thus\r\naffording the powerful monarch full knowledge of the proceedings, and an\r\nopportunity of being present and of practically forcing the selection of\r\nhis own candidate.\r\n\r\nThe Church gained much in power during Stephen’s reign, and deserved the\r\npower it gained, since it remained the only stable centre of good\r\ngovernment, while all other institutions crumbled around it. It was not\r\nunnatural that churchmen should advance new claims, and we find them\r\nadopting the watchword, afterwards so famous, “that the Church should be\r\nfree,” a vague phrase doubtless, destined to be embodied in Magna Carta.\r\nThe extent of immunity thus claimed was never clearly defined, and this\r\nvagueness was probably intentional, since an elastic phrase might be\r\nexpanded to keep pace with the ever-growing pretensions of the Church.\r\nChurchmen made it clear, however, that they meant it to include at the\r\nleast two principles—those rights afterwards known as “benefit of\r\nclergy,” and “canonical election” respectively.\r\n\r\nHenry II.’s attempt to force a clear definition, embodied in the\r\nConstitutions of Clarendon in 1164, signally failed, chiefly through the\r\nmiscarriage of his plans consequent on the murder of Becket. Yet the\r\nrights of the Church, although remaining theoretically unaltered from\r\nthe days of Stephen, felt the pressure directed by Henry’s energetic arm\r\nagainst all claims of privilege. Rights, theoretically the same, shrank\r\nto smaller practical limits when measured against the strength of Henry\r\nas compared with the weakness of Stephen. Canonical election thus\r\nremained at the close of the reign of Henry II. the same farce it had\r\nbeen in the days of Henry I. The “election” lay with the chapter of the\r\nvacant See; but the king told them plainly whom to elect. The other\r\nrights of the Church as actually enjoyed at the close of the reign of\r\nHenry Plantagenet were not far different from what had been set down in\r\nthe Constitutions of Clarendon, although these never received formal\r\nrecognition by Canterbury or by Rome. So matters stood between Church\r\nand State when the throne of England was bequeathed by Henry to his\r\nsons. It remained for John’s rash provocation, followed by his quick and\r\ncowardly retreat, to compel a new definition of the frontier between the\r\nspiritual and the temporal powers.\r\n\r\n                        IV. Richard I. and John.\r\n\r\nHenry II. before his death had fulfilled the task of restoring order, to\r\nwhich destiny had called him. To effect this, he had brought to\r\nperfection machinery of government of rare excellence, and equally well\r\nadapted for purposes of taxation, of dispensing justice, and of general\r\nadministration. Great as was the power for good of this new instrument\r\nin the hands of a wise and justice-loving king, it was equally powerful\r\nfor evil in the hands of an arrogant and unjust, or even of a careless\r\nmonarch. All the old enemies of the Crown had been crushed. Local\r\ngovernment, as now systematized, formed a source of strength, not of\r\nweakness; while the Church, whose highest offices were now filled with\r\nofficials trained in Henry’s own Household and Exchequer (ecclesiastics\r\nin name only, differing widely from saintly monks like Anselm), still\r\nremained the fast friend of the Crown. The monarchy was strong enough to\r\ndefy any one section of the nation, and no inclination was yet apparent\r\namong the estates of the realm to make common cause against the throne.\r\n\r\nThe very thoroughness with which the Crown had surmounted all its early\r\ndifficulties, induced in Henry’s successors, men born in the purple, an\r\nexaggerated feeling of security, and a tendency to overreach themselves\r\nby excessive arrogance. At the same time, the very abjectness of the\r\nvarious factors of the nation, now prostrate beneath the heel of the\r\nCrown, prepared them to sink their mutual suspicions and to form a tacit\r\nalliance in order to join issue with their common oppressor. Powers used\r\nmoderately and on the whole for national ends by Henry, were abused for\r\npurely selfish ends by his sons in succession. Richard’s heavy taxation\r\nand contemptuous indifference to English interests gradually reconciled\r\nmen’s minds to thoughts of change, and prepared the basis of a combined\r\nopposition to a power which threatened to grind all other powers to\r\npowder.\r\n\r\nIn no direction were these abuses felt so severely as in taxation.\r\nFinancial machinery had been elaborated to perfection, and large\r\nadditional sums could be squeezed from every class in the nation by an\r\nextra turn of the screw. Richard did not even require to incur the odium\r\nof this, since the ministers, who were his instruments, shielded him\r\nfrom the unpopularity of his measures, while he pursued his own good\r\npleasure abroad in war and tournament without even condescending to\r\nvisit the subjects he oppressed. Twice only, for a few months in each\r\ncase, did Richard visit England during a reign of ten years.\r\n\r\nIn his absence new methods of taxation were devised, and new classes of\r\nproperty subjected to it; in especial, personal effects—merchandise and\r\nother chattels—only once before (in 1187 for the Saladin tithe) placed\r\nunder contribution, were now made a regular source of royal revenue. The\r\nisolated precedent of Henry’s reign was gladly followed when an\r\nextraordinarily heavy burden had to be borne by the nation to produce\r\nthe ransom exacted for Richard’s release from prison. The very\r\nheartiness with which England made sacrifices to succour the Monarch in\r\nhis hour of need, was turned against the tax-payers. Richard showed no\r\ngratitude; and, being devoid of all kindly interest in his subjects, he\r\nargued that what had been paid once might equally well be paid again.\r\nThus he formed exaggerated notions of the revenue to be extracted from\r\nEngland. From abroad he sent demand after demand to his overworked\r\njusticiars for ever-increasing sums of money. The chief lessons of the\r\nreign are connected with this excessive taxation, and the consequent\r\ndiscontent which prepared the way for the new grouping of political\r\nforces under John.\r\n\r\nSome minor lessons may be noted:\r\n\r\n(1) In Richard’s absence the odium for his exactions fell upon his\r\nministers at home, who thus bore the burden meet for his own callous\r\nshoulders, while he enjoyed an undeserved popularity by reason of his\r\nbravery and achievements, exaggerated as these were by the halo of\r\nromance which surrounds a distant hero. Thus may be traced some dim\r\nforeshadowing of the doctrine of ministerial responsibility, although\r\nsuch analogies with modern politics must not be pushed too far.\r\n\r\n(2) Throughout the reign, many parts of Henry’s system, technical\r\ndetails of taxation and reforms in the administration of justice, were\r\nelaborated by Archbishop Hubert Walter. Principles closely connected\r\nwith trial by jury on the one hand and with election and representation\r\non the other were being quietly developed—destined to play an important\r\nrôle in other ages.\r\n\r\n(3) Richard is sometimes said to have inaugurated the golden age of\r\nmunicipalities. Undoubtedly many charters still extant bear witness to\r\nthe lavish hand with which he granted, on paper at least, franchises and\r\nprivileges to the nascent towns. John Richard Green finds the true\r\ninterest of the reign not in the King’s Crusades and French wars, so\r\nmuch as in his fostering care over the growth of municipal enterprise.\r\nThe importance of the consequences of such a policy is not diminished by\r\nthe fact that Richard acted from sordid motives—selling privileges, too\r\noften of a purely nominal character, as he sold everything else which\r\nwould fetch a price.\r\n\r\nThe death of Richard on 6th April, 1199, brought with it at least one\r\nimportant change; England was no longer to be governed by an absentee.\r\nJohn, as impatient of control as he was incompetent, endeavoured to\r\nshake himself free from the restraints of powerful ministers, and\r\ndetermined to conduct the work of government in his own way. The result\r\nwas an abrupt end to the progress made in the previous reign towards\r\nministerial responsibility. The odium formerly exhausting itself on the\r\njusticiars of Richard was now expended on John. While, previously, men\r\nhad sought redress in a change of minister, such vain expectations could\r\nno longer deceive. A new element of bitterness was added to injuries\r\nlong resented, and the nobles who felt the pinch of heavy taxation were\r\ncompelled to seek redress in an entirely new direction. All the forces\r\nof discontent played openly around the throne.\r\n\r\nAs is usual at the opening of a new reign, the discontented hoped that a\r\nchange of sovereign would bring some relief. The excessive taxation of\r\nthe late reign had been the result of exceptional circumstances. It was\r\nexpected that the new King would revert to the less burdensome scale of\r\nhis father’s financial measures. Such hopes were quickly disappointed.\r\nJohn’s needs proved as great as Richard’s, and the money he obtained was\r\nused for purposes that appealed to no one but himself. The excessive\r\nexactions demanded both in money and in service, coupled with the\r\nunpopular uses to which these were put, form the keynote of the whole\r\nreign. They form also the background of Magna Carta.\r\n\r\nThe reign falls naturally into three periods; the years in which John\r\nwaged a losing war with the King of France (1199-1206), the quarrel with\r\nthe Pope (1206-13), the great struggle of John with the barons\r\n(1213-16).\r\n\r\nThe first seven years were for England comparatively uneventful, except\r\nin the gradual deepening of disgust with John and all his ways. The\r\ncontinental dominions were ripe for losing, and John precipitated the\r\ncatastrophe by his injustice and dilatoriness. The ease with which\r\nNormandy was lost shows something more than the incapacity of the King\r\nas a ruler and leader—John Softsword as contemporary writers\r\ncontemptuously call him. It shows that the feudal army of Normandy had\r\ncome to regard the English Sovereign as an alien monarch, and refused to\r\nfight in support of the rule of a foreigner. The unwillingness of the\r\nEnglish nobles to succour John actively has also its significance. The\r\ndescendants of the men who helped William I. to conquer England had now\r\nlost all interest in the land from which they came. They were now purely\r\nEnglish landowners, and very different from the original Norman baronage\r\nwhose interests, like their estates, had been equally divided on both\r\nsides of the Channel.\r\n\r\nThe death of Archbishop Hubert Walter in July, 1205, deprived King John\r\nof the services of the most experienced statesman in England. It did\r\nmore, for it marked the termination of the long friendship between the\r\nEnglish Crown and the National Church. Its immediate effect was to\r\ncreate a vacancy, the filling of which led to a bitter quarrel with\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nJohn failed, as usual, to recognize the merits of abler men, and saw in\r\nthe death of his great Justiciar and Archbishop only the removal of an\r\nunwelcome restraint, and the opening to the Crown of a desirable piece\r\nof patronage. He prepared to strain to the utmost his rights in the\r\nelection of a successor to the See of Canterbury, in favour of one of\r\nhis own creatures, a certain John de Grey, already by royal influence\r\nBishop of Norwich. Unexpected opposition to his will was offered by the\r\ncanons of the Cathedral Church, who determined on a bold policy, namely,\r\nto turn their nominal right of canonical election into a reality, and to\r\nappoint their own nominee, without waiting either for the King’s\r\napproval or the co-operation of the suffragan bishops of the Province,\r\nwho, during the last three vacancies, had put forth a claim to\r\nparticipate in the election, and had invariably used their influence on\r\nbehalf of the King’s nominee. Reginald, the sub-prior, was secretly\r\nelected by the monks, and hurried abroad to obtain confirmation at Rome\r\nbefore the appointment was made public. Reginald’s vanity prevented his\r\nkeeping his pledge of secrecy, and a rumour reached the ear of John, who\r\nbrought pressure to bear on the monks, now frightened at their own\r\ntemerity, and secured de Grey’s appointment in a second election. The\r\nBishop of Norwich was actually enthroned at Canterbury, and invested by\r\nthe King with the temporalities of the See. All parties now sent\r\nrepresentatives to Rome. This somewhat petty squabble benefited none of\r\nthe original disputants; for the astute Innocent III. was quick to see\r\nan opportunity for papal aggrandisement. Both elections were set aside\r\nby decree of the Papal Curia, and the emissaries of the various parties\r\nwere coerced or persuaded to appoint there and then in the Pope’s\r\npresence the Pope’s own nominee, a certain Cardinal, English-born, but\r\nhitherto little known in England, Stephen Langton by name, destined to\r\nplay an important part in the future history of the land of his birth.\r\n\r\nJohn refused to view this triumph of papal arrogance in the light of a\r\ncompromise—the view diplomatically suggested by Innocent. The King, with\r\nthe hot blood common to his race, and the bad judgment peculiar to\r\nhimself, rushed headlong into a quarrel with Rome which he was incapable\r\nof carrying to a successful issue. The details of the struggle, the\r\ninterdicts and excommunications hurled by the Pope, and John’s measures\r\nof retaliation against the unfortunate English clergy, need not be\r\ndiscussed, since they do not directly affect the main plot which\r\nculminated at Runnymede.\r\n\r\nJohn was not without some measure of sagacity of a selfish and\r\nshort-sighted sort, but was completely devoid of far-seeing statecraft.\r\nOne day he was to reap the fruits of this quarrel in bitter humiliation\r\nand in the defeat of his most cherished aims; but, for the moment, the\r\nbreach with Rome seemed to lead to a triumph for the King. The papal\r\nencroachments furnished him with a suitable pretext for confiscating the\r\nproperty of the clergy. Thus his Exchequer was amply replenished, while\r\nhe was able for a time to conciliate his most inveterate opponents, the\r\nNorthern barons, by remitting during several years the hated burden of a\r\nscutage, which, in other periods of his reign, tended to become a yearly\r\nimposition. John had no intention, however, to forego his right to\r\nresume the practice of annual scutages whenever it suited him to do so.\r\nOn the contrary, he executed a measure intended to make them more\r\nremunerative in the future. This was the great Inquest of Service\r\nordered on 1st June, 1212.[4]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  See Round, _Commune of London_, 273. This measure is discussed _infra_\r\n  pp. 91-2.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nDuring these years, however, John temporarily relaxed the pressure on\r\nhis feudal tenants. His doing so failed to gain back any of their\r\ngoodwill, while he broadened the basis of future resistance by shifting\r\nhis oppressions to the clergy and through them to the poor.\r\n\r\nSome incidents of the autumn of 1212 require brief notice, as well from\r\ntheir own inherent interest as because they find an echo in the words of\r\nMagna Carta. Serious trouble had arisen with Wales. Llywelyn (who had\r\nmarried John’s natural daughter Joan, and had consolidated his power\r\nunder protection of the English King) now seized the occasion to cross\r\nthe border, while John was preparing his schemes for a new continental\r\nexpedition. The King changed his plans, and prepared to lead his troops\r\nto Wales instead of France. A muster was summoned for September at\r\nNottingham, and John went thither to meet them. Before tasting meat, as\r\nwe are told in Roger of Wendover’s graphic narrative, he hanged\r\ntwenty-eight Welsh hostages, boys of noble family, whom he held as\r\nsureties that Llywelyn would keep the peace.[5]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  R. Wendover, III. 239.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately thereafter, two messengers arrived simultaneously\r\nfrom Scotland and from Wales with unexpected tidings. John’s daughter,\r\nJoan, and the King of Scots, each independently warned him that his\r\nEnglish barons were prepared to revolt, under shelter of the Pope’s\r\nabsolution from their allegiance, and either to slay him or betray him\r\nto the Welsh. The King dared not afford them so good an opportunity. In\r\na panic he disbanded the feudal levies; and, accompanied only by his\r\nmercenaries, moved slowly back to London.[6]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  W. Coventry, II. 207; R. Wendover, III. 239.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTwo of the barons, Robert Fitz-Walter, afterwards the Marshal of the\r\narmy which, later on, opposed John at Runnymede, and Eustace de Vesci,\r\nshowed their knowledge of John’s suspicions (if they did not justify\r\nthem) by withdrawing secretly from his Court and taking to flight. The\r\nKing caused them to be outlawed in their absence, and thereafter seized\r\ntheir estates and demolished their castles.[7]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  From their possible connection with the wording of the famous chapter\r\n  39 of Magna Carta, it may be worth while to quote the exact words in\r\n  which Ralph de Coggeshall, _Chronicon Anglicanum_, p. 165, describes\r\n  this event, which he places (probably wrongly) in the year 1213.—“Rex\r\n  Eustachium de Vesci et Robertum filium Walteri, in comitatibus tertio\r\n  requisitos, cum eorum fautoribus utlaghiari fecit, castra eorum\r\n  subvertit, praedia occupavit.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThese events of September, 1212, rudely shook John out of the false\r\nsense of security in which he had wrapped himself a few months earlier.\r\nIn the Spring of the same year, he had still seemed to enjoy the full\r\ntide of prosperity; and he must have been a bold prophet who dared to\r\nforetell, as Peter of Wakefield did foretell, the speedy downfall of the\r\nKing—a prophecy the main purport of which (although not the details),\r\nwas actually accomplished.[8]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  See Miss Norgate, _John Lackland_, 170, and authorities there cited.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nJohn’s apparent security was deceptive; he had underestimated the powers\r\narrayed against him. Before the end of that year he had realized, in a\r\nsudden flash of illumination, that the Pope was too strong for him,\r\ncircumstanced as he then was. It may well be that, if John’s throne had\r\nrested on a solid basis of his subjects’ love, he might have defied with\r\nimpunity the thunders of Rome; but, although he was still an\r\nunrestrained despot, his despotism now rested on a hollow foundation.\r\nHis barons, particularly the eager spirits of the north, refrained from\r\nopen rebellion merely until a fit opportunity should be offered them.\r\nThe papal excommunication of a King relieved his subjects of their oaths\r\nof allegiance, and this might render their deliberate revolt dangerous\r\nand perhaps fatal. At this critical juncture Innocent played his leading\r\ncard, inviting the King of France to act as the executor of the sentence\r\nof excommunication against his brother King. John at once realized that\r\nthe time had come to make his peace with Rome.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should admire the sudden inspiration which showed the King\r\nthat his game had been played and lost, while we regret the humiliation\r\nof his surrender, and the former blindness which could not see a little\r\nway ahead.\r\n\r\nOn 13th May, 1213, John met Pandulf, the papal legate, and accepted\r\nunconditionally his demands, the same which he had refused\r\ncontemptuously some months before. Full reparation was to be made to the\r\nChurch. Stephen Langton was to be received as archbishop in all honour\r\nwith his banished bishops, friends and kinsmen. All church property was\r\nto be restored, with compensation for damage done. One of the minor\r\nconditions of John’s absolution was the restoration to Eustace de Vesci\r\nand Robert Fitz-Walter of the estates which they persuaded Innocent had\r\nbeen forfeited because of their loyalty to Rome.[9]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, 292–3.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nJohn’s humiliation did not stop even here. Two days later he resigned\r\nthe Crowns of England and Ireland, and received them again as the Pope’s\r\nfeudatory, promising to perform personal homage should occasion allow.\r\nSuch was the price which the King was now ready to pay for the Pope’s\r\nactive alliance against his enemies at home and abroad, the former\r\nsubmission having merely bought off the excommunication. John hoped thus\r\nto disentangle himself from his growing difficulties, and so to be free\r\nto avenge himself on his baronial enemies. The surrender of the Crown\r\nwas embodied in a formal legal document which bears to be made by John,\r\n“with the common council of our barons.” Were these merely words of\r\nform? They may have been so when first used; yet two years later the\r\nenvoys of the insurgent barons claimed at Rome that the credit (so they\r\nnow represented it) for the whole transaction lay with them. Perhaps the\r\nbarons did consent to the surrender, thinking that to make the Pope lord\r\nparamount of England would protect the inhabitants from the\r\nirresponsible tyranny of John; while John hoped (with better reason as\r\nevents proved) that the Pope’s friendship would increase his ability to\r\nwork his evil will upon his enemies. In any case, no active opposition\r\nor protest seems to have been raised by any one at the time of the\r\nsurrender. This step, so repugnant to later writers, seems not to have\r\nbeen regarded by contemporaries as a disgrace. Matthew Paris, indeed,\r\nwriting in the next generation, describes it as “a thing to be detested\r\nfor all time”; but then events had ripened in Matthew’s day, and he was\r\na keen politician rather than an impartial onlooker.[10]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  The late Cardinal Manning in an article in the _Contemporary Review_\r\n  for December, 1875 (since published in book form), on the Pope and\r\n  Magna Carta, insists, probably with reason, that contemporary opinion\r\n  saw nothing disgraceful in the surrender, rather the reverse.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nStephen Langton, now assured of a welcome to the high office into which\r\nhe had been thrust against John’s will, landed at Dover and was received\r\nby the King at Winchester on 20th July, 1213. John swore on the Gospels\r\nto cherish and defend Holy Church, to restore the good laws of Edward,\r\nand to render to all men their rights, repeating practically the words\r\nof the coronation oath. In addition, he promised to make reparation for\r\nall property taken from the Church or churchmen. This oath, with its\r\naccompanying promise, was the condition on which he was to be absolved,\r\nprovisionally by Langton, and more formally by a legate, to be sent from\r\nRome specially for that purpose.\r\n\r\n                    V. The Years of Crisis, 1213–15.\r\n\r\nFor a brief season after John had made his peace with Rome, he seemed to\r\nenjoy substantial fruits of his diplomacy. Once more the short-sighted\r\ncharacter of his abilities was illustrated; a brief triumph led to a\r\ndeeper fall. The King for the moment considered, with some show of\r\nreason, that he had regained the mastery of his enemies at home and\r\nabroad. Philip’s threatened invasion had to be abandoned; the people\r\nrenewed their allegiance on the removal of the papal sentence; the\r\nbarons had to reconcile themselves as best they could, awaiting a better\r\nopportunity to rebel. If John had confined himself to home affairs, he\r\nmight have postponed the final explosion: he could not, however,\r\nreconcile himself to the loss of the great continental heritage of his\r\nancestors. His attempts to recover Normandy and Anjou, partly by force\r\nof arms and partly by a great coalition, led to new exactions and new\r\nmurmurings, while they ended in complete failure, which left him,\r\ndiscredited and penniless, at the mercy of the malcontents at home.\r\n\r\nHis projected campaign in Poitou would require all the levies he could\r\nraise. More than once John demanded, and his barons refused, their\r\nfeudal service. Many excuses were put forward. At first they declined to\r\nfollow a King who had not yet been fully absolved. Yet when Archbishop\r\nStephen, on 20th July, 1213, removed the papal censure from John at\r\nWinchester, after exacting promises of good government, the northern\r\nbarons still refused. Their new plea was that the tenure on which they\r\nheld their lands did not compel them to serve abroad. They added that\r\nthey were already exhausted by expeditions within England.[11]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  R. Coggeshall, p. 167.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nJohn took this as open defiance, and determined, with troops at his back\r\n(_per vim et arma_), to compel obedience.\r\n\r\nBefore his preparations were completed, an important assembly had met at\r\nSt. Albans (on 4th August) to make sworn inquest as to the extent of\r\ndamage done to churchmen during the years of John’s quarrel with Rome.\r\nThe meeting is notable, not merely because of the reason of its summons,\r\nbut also because of its composition. It is the earliest national council\r\nin which the principle of representation received recognition (so far as\r\nour records go).[12] Four lawful men, with the reeve, from each village\r\nor manor on the royal demesne, were present, but only, it must be\r\nremembered, in a very mean capacity—only to make a sworn inquest as to\r\nthe amount of damage done. Such inquests by the humble representatives\r\nof the villages were quite common locally; the innovation lies in this,\r\nthat their verdict was now given in a national assembly. Directions were\r\nissued in the King’s name from the same meeting, commanding sheriffs,\r\nforesters, and others to observe the laws of Henry I. and to abstain\r\nfrom unjust exactions, as they valued their limbs and lives.[13]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, I. 566.\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  R. Wendover, III. 261-2.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOn 25th August, after John had set out with his mercenaries to punish by\r\nforce of arms the refusal of his northern magnates to follow him to the\r\nContinent, as he held them bound to do in terms of their feudal\r\nobligations, Stephen Langton held a meeting with the great men of the\r\nsouth. Many bishops, abbots, priors and deans, together with some lay\r\nmagnates of the southern counties, met him at St. Paul’s, London. The\r\nostensible object of this assembly was to determine what use the\r\nArchbishop should make of his power to grant partial relaxation of the\r\ninterdict still casting its blight over England—which could not be\r\nfinally lifted until the legate arrived with fuller powers. If we may\r\nbelieve Roger of Wendover, more important business was transacted in the\r\nKing’s absence. Stephen reminded the magnates that John’s absolution had\r\nbeen conditional on a promise of good government, and as a standard to\r\nguide them in judging what such government implied, he produced a copy\r\nof Henry I.’s Charter of Liberties. All present swore to “fight for\r\nthose liberties, if it were needful, even unto death.” The Archbishop\r\npromised his help, “and a confederacy being thus made between them, the\r\nconference was dissolved.”[14]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  Roger of Wendover, III. 263-6. Blackstone (_Great Charter_,\r\n  Introduction, p. vi.), makes the apposite comment that it seems\r\n  unlikely that the discovery by the Archbishop of a charter probably\r\n  already well known “should be a matter of such novelty and triumph.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nStephen Langton, however, desired a peaceable solution if possible, and\r\nthree days later we find him, after a somewhat hurried journey, at\r\nNorthampton, on the 28th of August, striving earnestly, and with\r\nsuccess, to avert civil war between John and the recalcitrant Crown\r\ntenants in the north.\r\n\r\nHis line of argument is worthy of especial note. The King, he urged,\r\nmust not levy war on his subjects before he had obtained a legal\r\njudgment against them. The substance of this advice should be compared\r\nwith the terms of chapter 39 of Magna Carta. John resented the\r\ninterference of Stephen in lay matters, and continued his march to\r\nNottingham; but threats of fresh excommunications caused him at length\r\nto consent to substitute legal process for violence, and to appoint a\r\nday for the trial of the defaulters before the _Curia Regis_—a trial\r\nwhich never took place.[15]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  R. Wendover, III. 262-3.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nJohn apparently continued his journey as far north as Durham, but\r\nreturned to meet the new papal legate Nicholas, to whom he performed the\r\npromised homage and repeated the formal act of surrender in St. Paul’s\r\non 3rd October.[16] Having thus completed his alliance with the Pope, he\r\nwas confident of worsting his enemies in France and England. As most, if\r\nnot all, of the great magnates were against him, he saw that it would be\r\nwell to strengthen his position by support of the class beneath them in\r\nthe feudal scheme of society. Perhaps it was this that led John to\r\nbroaden the basis of the national assembly. The great Council which met\r\nat Oxford on 15th November, 1213, was made notable by the presence, in\r\naddition to the Crown tenants, of representatives of the various\r\ncounties. The sheriffs, in the words of the King’s writs, were to cause\r\nto assemble all knights already summoned (that is, the Crown tenants)\r\nand four discreet men of each county “_ad loquendum nobiscum de negotiis\r\nregni nostri_.” Miss Norgate[17] lays stress on the fact that these\r\nwrits were issued after the death of the great Justiciar Geoffrey\r\nFitz-Peter, and before any successor had been appointed. John, she\r\nargues, acted on his own initiative, and is thus entitled to the credit\r\nof being the first statesman to introduce representatives of the\r\ncounties into the national assembly. The importance of this precedent\r\nneed not be obscured by the selfish nature of the motives to which it\r\nwas due. Knights who were tenants of mesne lords (Miss Norgate says\r\n“yeomen”) were invited to act as a counterpoise to the barons. This\r\ninnovation anticipated the line of progress afterwards followed by de\r\nMontfort and Edward I. Compared with it, the often-praised provisions of\r\nchapter 14 of Magna Carta must be regarded as antiquated and even\r\nreactionary.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  The charter recording this act may be read in _New Rymer_, I. 115. It\r\n  was sealed not in perishable wax, but in solid gold.\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  _John Lackland_, 195.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn the early spring of 1214, John considered his home troubles ended,\r\nand that he was now free to use against France the coalition formed by\r\nhis diplomacy. He went abroad early in February, leaving Peter des\r\nRoches, the unpopular Bishop of Winchester, to keep the peace as\r\nJusticiar, and to guard his interests, in concert with the papal legate.\r\nAlthough deserted by the northern barons, John relied partly on his\r\nmercenaries, but chiefly on the Emperor Otto and his other powerful\r\nallies. Fortune, always fickle, favoured him at first, only to ruin all\r\nhis schemes more completely in the end. The crash came on Sunday, 27th\r\nJuly, 1214, when the King of France triumphed over the allies at the\r\ndecisive battle of Bouvines. Three months later, John was compelled to\r\nsign a five years’ truce with Philip, abandoning all pretensions to\r\nrecover his continental dominions.\r\n\r\nHe had left enemies at home more dangerous than those who conquered him\r\nat Bouvines—enemies who had been watching with trembling eagerness the\r\nvicissitudes of his fortunes abroad. His earlier successes struck dismay\r\ninto the malcontents in England, apprehensive of the probable sequel to\r\nhis triumphant return home. They waited with anxiety, but not in\r\nidleness, the culmination of his campaign, wisely refraining from open\r\nrebellion until news reached them of his failure or success. Meanwhile,\r\nthey quietly organized their programme of reform and their measures of\r\nresistance. John’s strenuous endeavours to exact money and service,\r\nwhile failing to fill his Exchequer as he hoped, had ripened dormant\r\nhostility into an active confederacy organized for resistance. When\r\nEngland learned the result of the battle, the barons felt that the\r\nmoment for action had arrived.\r\n\r\nEven while abroad, John had not relaxed his efforts to wring exactions\r\nfrom England. Without consent or warning, he had imposed a scutage at\r\nthe unprecedented rate of three marks on the knight’s fee. Writs for its\r\ncollection had been issued on 26th May, 1214, an exception being indeed\r\nallowed for tenants personally present in the King’s army in Poitou. The\r\nnorthern barons, who had already refused to serve in person, now refused\r\nlikewise to pay the scutage. This repudiation was couched in words\r\nparticularly bold and sweeping; they denied liability to follow the King\r\nnot merely to Poitou, but to any part of the Continent.[18]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  See W. Coventry, II. 217, _dicentes se propter terras quas in Anglia\r\n  tenent non debere regem extra regnum sequi nec ipsum euntem scutagio\r\n  juvare_. The legality of this contention is discussed _infra_, pp.\r\n  83-6.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhen John returned, in the middle of October, 1214, he found himself\r\nconfronted with a crisis unique in English history. During his absence,\r\nthe opponents of his misrule had drawn together, formulated their\r\ngrievances, and matured their plans. The embarrassments on the Continent\r\nwhich weakened the King, heartened the opposition. The northern barons\r\ntook the lead. Their cup of wrath, which had long been filling,\r\noverflowed when the scutage of three marks was imposed. Within a\r\nfortnight of his landing, John held an interview with the malcontents at\r\nBury St. Edmunds (on 4th November, 1214).[19] No compromise was arrived\r\nat. John pressed for payment of the scutage, and the barons refused.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  See Miss Norgate, _John Lackland_, p. 221.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that, after John’s retiral, a conference of a more\r\nprivate nature was held at which, under cloak of attending the Abbey for\r\nprayer, a conspiracy against John was sworn. Roger of Wendover gives a\r\ngraphic account of what happened. The magnates came together “as if for\r\nprayers; but there was something else in the matter, for after they had\r\nheld much secret discourse, there was brought forth in their midst the\r\ncharter of King Henry I., which the same barons had received in London\r\n... from Archbishop Stephen of Canterbury.”[20] A solemn oath was taken\r\nto withdraw their fealty (a threat actually carried into effect on 5th\r\nMay of the following year), and to wage war on the King, unless he\r\ngranted their liberties; and a date—soon after Christmas—was fixed for\r\nmaking their formal demands. Meanwhile they separated to prepare for\r\nwar. The King also realized that a resort to arms was imminent. While\r\nendeavouring to collect mercenaries, he tried unsuccessfully to sow\r\ndissension among his opponents. In especial, he hoped to buy off the\r\nhostility of the Church by a separate charter which he issued on 21st\r\nNovember. This professes to be granted “of the common consent of our\r\nbarons.” Its object was to gratify the Church by turning canonical\r\nelection from a sham into a reality. The election of prelates, great and\r\nsmall, should henceforward be really free in all cathedral and\r\nconventual churches and monasteries, saving to the Crown the right of\r\nwardship during vacancies. John promised never to deny or delay his\r\nconsent to an election, and conferred powers on the electors, if he\r\nshould do so, to proceed without him. The King was bitterly disappointed\r\nin his hope that by this bribe he would bring over the national Church\r\nfrom the barons’ side to his own.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  R. Wendover, III. 293.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nJohn was probably well aware of what took place at St. Edmunds after he\r\nhad left, and he also knew that the close of the year was the time fixed\r\nfor the making of demands. He held what must have been an anxious\r\nChristmas at Worcester (always a favourite resting-place of this King),\r\nbut tarried only for a day, hastening to the Temple, London, where the\r\nproximity of the Tower would give him a feeling of security. There, on\r\n6th January, 1215, a deputation from the insurgents met him without\r\ndisguising that their demands were backed by force. These demands, they\r\ntold him, included the confirmation of the laws of King Edward, with the\r\nliberties set forth in Henry’s Charter.\r\n\r\nOn the advice of the Archbishop and the Marshal, who acted as mediators,\r\nJohn asked a truce till Easter, which was granted in return for the\r\npromise that he would then give reasonable satisfaction. The Archbishop,\r\nthe Marshal, and the Bishop of Ely were named as the King’s securities.\r\n\r\nOn 15th January, John re-issued the Charter to the Church, and demanded\r\na renewal of homage from all his subjects. The sheriffs in each county\r\nwere instructed to administer the oath in a specially stringent form;\r\nall Englishmen must now swear to “stand by him against all men.”\r\nMeanwhile emissaries were dispatched by both sides to Rome. Eustace de\r\nVesci, as spokesman of the malcontents, asked Innocent, as overlord of\r\nEngland, to compel John to restore the ancient liberties, and claimed\r\nconsideration on the ground that John’s surrender to the Pope had been\r\nmade under pressure put on the King by them—all to no effect. John\r\nthought to propitiate the Pope by taking the cross, a politic measure\r\n(the date of which is given by one authority as 2nd February, and by\r\nanother as 4th March), which would also serve to protect him against\r\npersonal violence, and which afforded him, as is well illustrated by\r\nseveral chapters of Magna Carta, a fertile excuse for delay in remedying\r\nabuses. In April, the northern barons, convinced that the moment for\r\naction had arrived, met in arms at Stamford, and after Easter (when the\r\ntruce had expired) marched southward to Brackley, in Northampton. There\r\nthey were met, on 27th April, by the Archbishop and the Marshal, as\r\nemissaries from the King, who demanded what they wanted. They received\r\nin reply, and took back with them to John, a certain schedule, which\r\nconsisted for the most part of ancient laws and customs of the realm,\r\nwith an added threat that if the King did not immediately adhibit his\r\nseal the rebels would constrain him by seizing his castles, lands, and\r\ngoods.[21]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  R. Wendover, III. 298.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis schedule may be regarded as a rough draft of the document more\r\nfully drawn out six weeks later, commonly known as the Articles of the\r\nBarons.[22]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  Is it not possible that the so-called “unknown charter of Liberties”\r\n  (see _infra_ under Part V. and Appendix) was the very schedule\r\n  mentioned by Wendover? It was drawn up in the form of a charter, so as\r\n  to be ready for the immediate imprint of the seal they demanded.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nJohn’s answer, when he read these demands, was emphatic. “Why do not the\r\nbarons, with these unjust exactions, ask my kingdom?” Then furious, he\r\ndeclared with an oath that he would never grant them such liberties,\r\nwhereby he would make himself a slave.[23]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  R. Wendover, III. 298.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOn 5th May the barons formally renounced allegiance[24] and chose as\r\ncommander, Robert Fitz-Walter, who styled himself piously and\r\ngrandiloquently, “Marshal of the army of God and Holy Church.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  Blackstone, _Great Charter_, p. xiii., citing the _Annals of\r\n  Dunstable_ (p. 43), says they were absolved at Wallingford by a Canon\r\n  of Durham.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe insurgents, still shivering on the brink of civil war, delayed to\r\nmarch southwards. Much would depend on the attitude of London, with its\r\nwealth and central position; and John bade high for the support of its\r\ncitizens. On 9th May a new charter[25] was granted to the Londoners, who\r\nnow received a long-coveted privilege, the right to elect their mayor\r\nannually and to remove him at the year’s end. This marked the\r\nculmination of a long series of progressive grants in their favour.\r\nPreviously the mayor had held office for life, and Henry Fitz-Aylwin,\r\nthe earliest holder of the office (appointed perhaps in 1191), had died\r\nin 1213.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\n  The Charter appears _Rot. Chart._, p. 207. _Cf._ under chapter 13\r\n  _infra_, where the rights of the Londoners are discussed.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nApparently no price was paid for this charter; but John doubtless\r\nexpected in return the grateful support of the Londoners, exactly as he\r\nhad expected the support of churchmen when he twice granted a charter in\r\ntheir favour. In both instances he was disappointed. Next day he made,\r\nprobably as a measure of delay, an offer of arbitration to the barons.\r\nIn the full tide of military preparations, he issued a writ in these\r\nwords: \"Know that we have conceded to our barons who are against us that\r\nwe shall not take or disseise them or their men, nor go against them\r\n_per vim vel per arma_, unless by the law of our land, or by the\r\njudgment of their peers _in curia nostra_, until consideration shall\r\nhave been made by four whom we shall choose on our part and four whom\r\nthey shall choose on their part, and the lord Pope who shall be oversman\r\nover them\"—words worthy of careful comparison with those used in chapter\r\n39 of Magna Carta. The offer could not be taken seriously, since it left\r\nthe decision of every vital issue virtually to the Pope, whom the barons\r\ndistrusted.[26]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  The writ is given in _Rot. Pat._, 1. 141, and also in _New Rymer_, I.\r\n  128.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAnother royal writ, of two days later date, shows a rapid change of\r\npolicy, doubtless due to the contemptuous rejection of arbitration. On\r\n12th May, John ordered the sheriffs to do precisely what he had offered\r\nnot to do. They were told to take violent measures against the rebels\r\nwithout waiting for a “judgment of peers” or other formality. Lands,\r\ngoods, and chattels of the King’s enemies were to be seized and applied\r\nto his benefit.[27]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  For writ, see _Rot. Claus._, 204.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe barons, rejecting all offers, marched by Northampton, Bedford, and\r\nWare, towards the capital. London, in spite of the charter received\r\neight days earlier, boldly threw in its lot with the insurgents, to whom\r\nit opened its gates on 17th May.[28] The example of London was quickly\r\nfollowed by other towns and by many hesitating nobles. The confederates\r\nfelt strong enough to issue letters to all who still adhered to the\r\nKing, bidding them forsake him on pain of forfeiture.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\n  Some authorities give 24th May as the date. It must have been the\r\n  17th; since _New Rymer_, p. 121, under the date of 18th May, prints a\r\n  writ of John, informing Rowland Blaot of the surrender of London to\r\n  the barons. This was followed on 20th May (_N.R._, p. 121) by another\r\n  royal writ, ordering all bailiffs and other faithful, to molest the\r\n  Londoners in every way possible.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nJohn found himself, for the moment, without power of effective\r\nresistance; and, probably with the view of gaining time rather than of\r\ncommitting himself irretrievably to any abatement of his prerogatives,\r\nagreed to meet his opponents. As a preliminary to this, on 8th June he\r\nissued a safe-conduct for the barons’ representatives to meet him at\r\nStaines within the three days following. This was apparently too short\r\nnotice, as on 10th June, John, now at Windsor, granted an extension of\r\nthe time and safe-conduct till Monday, 15th June. William the Marshal\r\nand other envoys were dispatched from Windsor to the barons in London\r\nwith what was practically a message of surrender. The barons were told\r\nthat John “would freely accede to the laws and liberties which they\r\nasked,” if they would appoint a place and day for a meeting. The\r\nintermediaries, in the words of Roger of Wendover,[29] \"without guile\r\ncarried back to the barons the message which had been guilefully imposed\r\non them\"—implying that John meant to make no promises, except such as\r\nwere insincere. Yet the barons, _immenso fluctuantes gaudio_, fixed as\r\nthe time of meeting the last day of the extended truce, Monday, 15th\r\nJune, at a certain meadow between Staines and Windsor, known as\r\nRunnymede.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 29:\r\n\r\n  III. 301.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n                       VI. Runnymede, and after.\r\n\r\nOn 15th June the King and the Barons met. On the side of the insurgents\r\nappeared a great host; on the monarch’s, merely a small band of\r\nmagnates, loyal to the person of the King, but only half-hearted, at the\r\nbest, in his support. Their names may be read in the preamble to the\r\nCharter: the chief among them, Stephen Langton, still nominally neutral,\r\nwas known to be in full sympathy with the rebels.\r\n\r\nDr. Stubbs,[30] maintaining that the whole baronage of England was\r\nimplicated in these stirring events, gives a masterly analysis of its\r\nmore conspicuous members into four great groups: (1) the Northumbrani or\r\nNorenses of the chroniclers, names famous in the northern counties, who\r\nhad been the first to raise the standard of open revolt, and retained\r\nthe lead throughout; (2) the other nobles from all parts of England, who\r\nhad shown themselves ready from an early date to co-operate with the\r\nNortherners—“the great baronial families that had been wise enough to\r\ncast away the feudal aspirations of their forefathers, and the rising\r\nhouses which had sprung from the ministerial nobility”; (3) the moderate\r\nparty who, ready to worship the rising sun, deserted John after London\r\nhad joined the rebels, including even the King’s half-brother (the Earl\r\nof Salisbury), the loyal Marshal, Hubert de Burgh, and other ministers\r\nof the Crown, whose names may be read in the preamble to the Charter;\r\nand (4) the tools of John’s misgovernment, mostly men of foreign birth,\r\ntied to John by motives of interest as well as by personal loyalty,\r\nsince their differences with the baronial leaders lay too deep for\r\nreconciliation, most of whom are branded by name in Magna Carta as for\r\never incapable of holding office in the realm. These men of desperate\r\nfortunes alone remained whole-hearted on John’s side when the crisis\r\ncame.[31]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:\r\n\r\n  _Const. Hist._, I. 581-3.\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\n  The individual names may be read in Stubbs, _Ibid._; and readers in\r\n  search of biographical knowledge are referred to Bémont, _Chartes_,\r\n  39–40, and for fuller, though less reliable information, to Thomson,\r\n  _Magna Charta_, 270–322.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhen the conference began, the fourth group was not near John, being\r\notherwise occupied in the command of castle garrisons or of troops\r\nactually in the field; the third group, a small one, was with him; and\r\nthe first and second groups were, in their imposing strength, arrayed\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the vagueness of contemporary accounts prevents us from\r\nreproducing with certainty the progress of negotiations on that eventful\r\n15th of June and the few days following. Some inferences, however, may\r\nbe drawn from the words of the completed Charter itself and from those\r\nof several closely related documents. One of these, the Articles of the\r\nBarons,[32] is sometimes supposed to be identical in its terms with the\r\nSchedule which had been already presented to the King’s emissaries, at\r\nBrackley, on the 27th of April.[33] It is more probable, however, that\r\nduring the seven eventful weeks which had since elapsed, the original\r\ndemands had been somewhat modified. It is not unlikely that the interval\r\nhad been employed in making the terms of the suggested agreement more\r\nfull and specific. The Schedule of April was probably only a rough draft\r\nof the Articles as we know them, and these formed in their turn the new\r\ndraft on which the completed Charter was based. Articles and Charter are\r\nalike authenticated with the impress of the King’s great seal, an\r\nindisputable proof that the terms of each of them actually received his\r\nofficial consent.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 32:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix.\r\n\r\nFootnote 33:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, p. 40.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis fact affords a strong presumption that an interval must have\r\nelapsed between the King’s acceptance of the first and the final\r\ncompletion of the second; since it would have been absurd to seal what\r\nwas practically a draft at the same time as the principal instrument.\r\nThe probability of such an interval must not be lost sight of in any\r\nattempt to reconstruct in chronological sequence the stages of the\r\nnegotiations at Runnymede.\r\n\r\nA few undoubted facts form a starting-point on which inferences may be\r\nbased. John’s headquarters were fixed at Windsor from Monday, 15th June,\r\nto the afternoon of Tuesday the 23rd. On each of these nine days (with\r\nthe possible exception of the 16th and 17th) he visited Runnymede to\r\nconfer with the barons.[34]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 34:\r\n\r\n  So far there can be no doubt. Either on the _Close Rolls_ or on the\r\n  _Patent Rolls_ (q.v.) copies of one or more writs are preserved dated\r\n  from Windsor on each of these days, and also one or more dated from\r\n  Runnymede on 15th, 18th, 19th, 20th, 21st, 22nd, and 23rd June.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTwo crucial stages in these negotiations were clearly reached on Monday\r\nthe 15th (the date borne by Magna Carta itself) and on Friday the 19th\r\n(the day on which John in more than one writ stated that peace had been\r\nconcluded). What happened exactly on each of these two days is, however,\r\nto some extent, matter of conjecture. It is here maintained, with some\r\nconfidence, that on Monday the substance of the barons’ demands was\r\nprovisionally accepted and that the Articles were then sealed; while on\r\nFriday this arrangement was finally confirmed and Magna Carta itself, in\r\nseveral duplicates, was sealed.\r\n\r\nTo justify these inferences, a more detailed examination of the evidence\r\navailable will be necessary. The earliest meeting between John and the\r\nbaronial leaders, all authorities are agreed, took place on Monday, 15th\r\nJune, probably in the early morning. The barons undoubtedly came to the\r\nconference provided with an accurate list of those grievances which they\r\nwere determined to have redressed. On the previous 27th of April the\r\nrebels had sent a written Schedule to the King, along with a demand that\r\nhe should signify his acceptance by affixing his seal;[35] they are not\r\nlikely to have been less fully prepared on 15th June.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 35:\r\n\r\n  R. Wendover, III. 298.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nJohn, on his part, would naturally try a policy of evasions and delays;\r\nand, when these were clearly useless, would then endeavour to secure\r\nmodifications of the terms offered. These tactics met with no success.\r\nHis opponents demanded a plain acceptance of their plainly expressed\r\ndemands. Before nightfall, John, overawed by their firmness and by the\r\nnumbers of the armed force behind them, was constrained to surrender.\r\nLeaving minor points of detail to be subsequently adjusted, he\r\nprovisionally accepted the substance of the long list of reforms put\r\nbefore him by the barons, on the understanding that they would renew\r\ntheir allegiance and give him some security that they would keep the\r\npeace. In proof of this bargain, the heads of the agreement were rapidly\r\nengrossed on parchment to the number of forty-nine, and the great seal\r\nwas impressed on the wax of the label, where it may still be seen.[36]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 36:\r\n\r\n  In the British Museum. See _infra_ under Part V.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe parchment containing these Articles of the Barons may have been the\r\nidentical Schedule actually prepared by the rebel leaders previous to\r\nthe meeting; but, more probably, it was written out at Runnymede during\r\nthe conference on the 15th (or between two conferences on that day) by\r\none of the clerks of the royal Chancery. This is more in keeping with\r\nits heading (written in the same hand, and apparently at the same time\r\nas the body of the deed), _Ista sunt capitula quae barones petunt et\r\ndominus rex concedit_.\r\n\r\nLikely enough, it followed closely the words of the baronial Schedule;\r\nbut it may have contained some slight modifications in favour of the\r\nCrown. One such, at least, was inserted, apparently as an afterthought\r\n(on the intervention of the King perhaps, or one of his friends);\r\narticles 45 and 46, as originally conceived, have been subsequently\r\nconnected by a rude bracket, and a qualifying proviso added which\r\npractically bestowed on the Archbishop the powers of an arbitrator to\r\ndetermine whether both articles should be altered in favour of the Crown\r\nor no.[37] The entire document is in a running hand, and appears to have\r\nbeen rapidly though carefully written. Its engrossment upon parchment\r\nwith a quill pen must have occupied several hours; but a diligent\r\ncopyist would not find it beyond his powers to complete the task in one\r\nday.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 37:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Blackstone, _Great Charter_, xvii.: \"subjoined in a more hasty\r\n  hand, ... as if added at the instance of the King’s commissioners upon\r\n  more mature deliberation.\"\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTuesday, Wednesday and Thursday were consumed in further negotiations as\r\nto matters of detail; in reducing the heads of agreement already\r\naccepted to the more binding form of a feudal charter; and in engrossing\r\nseveral copies for greater security. Everything was, however, ready for\r\na final settlement on Friday the 19th. At the conference held on that\r\nday the conclusion of the final concord probably included several steps;\r\namong others, the nomination by the opposition, with the King’s tacit\r\nacquiescence, of twenty-five barons to act as Executors under chapter\r\n61,[38] the solemn sealing and delivery of several original copies of\r\nthe Great Charter in its final form, the taking of an oath by all\r\nparties to abide by its provisions, and the issue of the first batch of\r\nwrits of instructions to the sheriffs.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 38:\r\n\r\n  See _infra_ under that chapter.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBlackstone[39] thinks that the barons on that day renewed their oaths of\r\nfealty and homage. It is more probable that, until John had actually\r\ncarried out the more pressing reforms promised in Magna Carta, they\r\nrefused formally to swear allegiance, undertaking, however, in the\r\nhearing of the two archbishops and other prelates, that they would keep\r\nthe peace and furnish security to that effect in any form that John\r\nmight name, except only by delivery of their castles or of hostages.[40]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 39:\r\n\r\n  _Great Charter_, p. xxiv.\r\n\r\nFootnote 40:\r\n\r\n  See Protest of Archbishops _infra_, p. 52.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe statement that Friday, 19th June, was the day on which peace was\r\nfinally concluded rests on unmistakable evidence. On 21st June, John\r\nwrote from Windsor to William of Cantilupe, one of his captains,\r\ninstructing him not to enforce payment of any unpaid balances of\r\n“tenseries”[41] demanded since the preceding Friday, “on which day peace\r\nwas made between the King and his barons.”[42]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 41:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Round explains this word in a learned appendix (_Geoffrey de\r\n  Mandeville_, p. 414) to mean “blackmail,” _i.e._ “money extorted under\r\n  pretence of protection or defence.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 42:\r\n\r\n  See _Rot. Claus._, p. 225 (17 John membrane 31). The evidence of this\r\n  writ does not stand alone. In another writ on the same membrane of the\r\n  _Close Rolls_, dated 19th June, John informs his half-brother, the\r\n  Earl of Salisbury, that he has concluded peace, and instructs him to\r\n  restore certain lands and castles immediately, as this had been made a\r\n  condition of peace. See also the writ to Stephen Harengod _infra_, p.\r\n  49.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt has been taken for granted by many historians that the peace was\r\nfinally concluded, and the Great Charter actually sealed and issued on\r\nthe 15th, not on the 19th.[43] The fact that all four copies of Magna\r\nCarta still extant bear this date seems to have been regarded as\r\nabsolutely conclusive on this point. Experts in diplomatics, however,\r\nhave long been aware that elaborate charters and other documents, which\r\noccupied a considerable time in preparation, usually bore the date, not\r\nof their actual execution, but of the day on which were concluded the\r\ntransactions of which they form the record. Legal instruments were thus\r\ncommonly ante-dated (as it would be reckoned according to modern legal\r\npractice). Thus it is far from safe to infer from Magna Carta’s mention\r\nof its own date that the great seal was actually adhibited on the 15th\r\nJune.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 43:\r\n\r\n  Blackstone, however (_Great Charter_, xv.), speaks of a “conference\r\n  which lasted for several days, and did not come to a conclusion till\r\n  Friday, the 19th June.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSuch presumption as exists points the other way. The Great Charter is a\r\nlengthy and elaborate document, and it is barely possible that any one\r\nof the four originals known to us could have been engrossed (to say\r\nnothing of the adjustment of the substance and form) within one day. Not\r\nonly is it much longer than the Articles on which it is founded; but\r\neven the most casual comparison will convince any unbiassed mind of the\r\nslower rate of engrossment of the Charter. All four copies show marks of\r\ngreat deliberation, while those at Lincoln and Salisbury in particular\r\nare exquisite models of leisurely and elaborate penmanship. The highly\r\nfinished initial letters of the first line and other ornamental features\r\nmay be instructively compared with the plain, business-like, rapid hand\r\nof the Articles. How many additional copies now lost were once in\r\nexistence bearing the same date, it is impossible to say; but each of\r\nthose still extant may well have occupied four days in the writing.[44]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:\r\n\r\n  Miss Norgate, _John Lackland_, p. 234, acquiesces in the view\r\n  generally received, fixing Monday as the day on which the final\r\n  concord was arrived at, but she relies for evidence on a more than\r\n  doubtful interpretation of what is undoubtedly an error in the copy of\r\n  a writ by King John appearing on the _Patent Rolls_. This writ, which\r\n  as copied in the _Rolls_ bears to be dated 18th June (erroneously as\r\n  will immediately be shown), is addressed to Stephen Harengod (in terms\r\n  closely resembling those of the writ already cited from the _Close\r\n  Rolls_ addressed to William of Cantilupe), announcing _inter alia_\r\n  that terms of peace had been agreed upon “last Friday.” Miss Norgate\r\n  contends with reason that there must be a mistake somewhere, since on\r\n  the Friday preceding the 18th, negotiations had not even begun. She is\r\n  confident that \"the ‘die Veneris’ which occurs three times in the writ\r\n  is in each case an unquestionable, though unaccountable, error for\r\n  ‘die Lunae.’\" Yet, it is unlikely that a scribe writing three days\r\n  after so momentous an event could have mistaken the day of the week.\r\n  It is infinitely more probable that in writing xxiij. he formed the\r\n  second “x” so carelessly that it was mistaken by the enrolling clerk\r\n  for a “v.” The correct date is thus the 23rd, and the reference is to\r\n  Friday the 19th. This presumption becomes a certainty by comparison\r\n  with the words of the writ to William of Cantilupe, dated the 21st (of\r\n  the existence of which Miss Norgate was probably not aware).\r\n\r\nA comparison between the two documents shows few changes of importance\r\nin the tenor.[45]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\n  Blackstone, _Great Charter_, xviii., has given a careful analysis of\r\n  the points of difference.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe one outstanding addition is the insertion, in an emphatic form, both\r\nat the beginning and at the end of the Charter, of a general declaration\r\nin favour of the freedom and rights of the Church. The inference seems\r\nto be that a new influence was brought to bear, between the preparation\r\nof the draft and that of the Charter. It was the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury and his friends who thus converted the original baronial\r\nmanifesto into something more nearly resembling a declaration of rights\r\nfor the nation at large. One or two minor alterations seem slightly to\r\nbenefit the Crown,[46] while several others, rightly viewed, suggest an\r\ninfluence at work unfavourable to the towns and trading classes.[47]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\n  _E.g._ chapters 48 and 52. For alterations directed against the\r\n  trading classes, see chapters 12, 13, 35, and 41 _infra_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  Miss Norgate, _John Lackland_, 233, takes a different view, holding\r\n  that the influence of Stephen Langton dates from an earlier period.\r\n  The original articles “are obviously not the composition of the barons\r\n  mustered under Robert Fitz-Walter,” who could never have risen to “the\r\n  lofty conception embodied in the Charter—the conception of a contract\r\n  between King and people which should secure equal rights to every\r\n  class and every individual in the nation.” The correctness of this\r\n  estimate is discussed _infra_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn addition to the various originals of the Charter issued under the\r\ngreat seal, chapter 62 provides that authenticated copies should be made\r\nand certified as correct by “Letters Testimonial,” under the seals of\r\nthe two archbishops with the legate and the bishops. This was done, but\r\nthe exact date of their issue is unknown.[48]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:\r\n\r\n  No specimen of these Letters Testimonial is known to exist, but a copy\r\n  is preserved on folio 234 of the _Red Book of the Exchequer_. See\r\n  Appendix.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe same Friday which thus saw the completion of negotiations saw also\r\nthe issue of the first batch of letters of instructions to the various\r\nsheriffs, telling them that a firm peace had been concluded, by God’s\r\ngrace, between John and the barons and freemen of the kingdom, as they\r\nmight hear and see by the Charter which had been made, and which was to\r\nbe published throughout the district, and firmly observed. Each sheriff\r\nwas further commanded to cause all in his bailiwick to make oath\r\naccording to the form of the Charter to the twenty-five barons or their\r\nattorneys, and further, to see to the appointment of twelve knights of\r\nthe county in full County Court, in order that they might declare upon\r\noath all evil customs requiring to be reformed, as well of sheriffs as\r\nof their servants, foresters, and others.[49] This was held to apply\r\nchiefly to the redress of forest grievances.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\n  See _Rot. Pat._, I. 180, and _Select Charters_, 306–7.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nApparently, four days elapsed before similar letters, accompanied by\r\ncopies of the Charter, could be sent to every sheriff. During the same\r\nfew days, several writs (some of which have already been mentioned) were\r\ndispatched to military commanders with orders to stop hostilities. A few\r\nwrits, dated mostly 25th June, show that some obnoxious sheriffs had\r\nbeen removed to make way for better men. Hubert de Burgh, a moderate\r\nthough loyal adherent, and a man generally respected, was appointed\r\nJusticiar in room of the hated Peter des Roches. On 27th June, another\r\nwrit directed the sheriffs and the elected knights to punish, by\r\nforfeiture of lands and chattels, all those who refused to swear to the\r\ntwenty-five Executors within a fortnight. All these various instructions\r\nmay be regarded as forming part of the settlement of the 19th of June,\r\nand were dispatched with the greatest rapidity possible.\r\n\r\nEven after the settlement arrived at on Friday, some minor points of\r\ndispute remained. The barons refused to be satisfied without substantial\r\nsecurity that the reforms and restorations agreed on would be carried\r\nout by the King; they demanded that both the city of London and the\r\nTower of London should be left completely under their control as pledges\r\nof John’s good faith, until 15th August, or longer, if the reforms had\r\nnot then been completed. John obtained a slight modification of these\r\ndemands; he surrendered the city of London to his opponents, as they\r\nasked; but placed the Tower in the neutral custody of the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury. These conditions were embodied in a supplementary treaty,\r\nwhich describes itself as _Conventio facta inter Regem Angliae et\r\nbarones ejusdem regni_.[50] If the barons distrusted John, he was\r\nequally distrustful of them, demanding the security they had promised\r\nfor fulfilment of their part of the original compact. He now asked a\r\nformal charter in his favour that they would observe the peace and their\r\noaths of homage, which they point-blank refused to grant. The King\r\nappealed to the prelates without effect. The archbishops, with several\r\nsuffragans, however, put a formal protest on record of the barons’\r\npromise and subsequent refusal to keep it.[51]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 50:\r\n\r\n  _New Rymer_, I. 133. See Appendix. It is undated, but must be later\r\n  than the letters to sheriffs concerning election of twelve knights, to\r\n  which it alludes.\r\n\r\nFootnote 51:\r\n\r\n  _Rot. Pat._, p. 181. As we have to depend for our knowledge of this\r\n  important protest on one copy, engrossed on the back of a membrane of\r\n  an official roll (No. 18 of John’s 17th year), it is possible to doubt\r\n  its genuineness; but it is unlikely to be purely a forgery.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe two archbishops and their brother prelates entered a second protest\r\nof a different nature. They seem to have become alarmed by the drastic\r\nmeasures adopted or likely to be adopted, founded on the verdicts of the\r\ntwelve knights elected in each county to carry into effect the various\r\nclauses of the Great Charter directed against abuses of the Forest laws.\r\nApparently, it was feared that reforms of a sweeping nature would\r\nresult, and practically abolish the royal forests altogether.\r\nAccordingly, they placed their protest formally on record—acting\r\nundoubtedly in the interests of the Crown, feeling that as mediators\r\nthey were bound in some measure to see fairplay. They objected to a\r\nstrained construction of the words of the Charter, holding that the\r\narticles in question ought to be understood as limited; all customs\r\nnecessary for the preservation of the forests should remain in\r\nforce.[52]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 52:\r\n\r\n  See _Rot. Pat._ and _New Rymer_, I. 134.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe provisions referred to were, as is now well known, chapters 47, 48,\r\nand 53 of Magna Carta itself, and not, as Roger of Wendover states, a\r\nseparate Forest Charter.[53] That writer was led into this unfortunate\r\nerror by confusing the charter granted by King John with its re-issue by\r\nhis son in 1217, when provisions for the reform of the forest law _were_\r\nframed into a separate supplementary charter. From Roger’s time onwards,\r\nthe charters of Henry III. were reproduced in all texts and treatises,\r\nin place of the real charter actually granted by John. Sir William\r\nBlackstone was the first commentator to discover this grievous error,\r\nand he clearly emphasized the grave differences between the terms\r\ngranted by John and those of his son, showing in particular that the\r\nformer king granted no separate Forest Charter at all.[54]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 53:\r\n\r\n  See R. Wendover, III. 302-318.\r\n\r\nFootnote 54:\r\n\r\n  _Great Charter_, p. xxi.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBefore the conferences at Runnymede came to an end, confidence in the\r\ngood intentions of the twenty-five Executors, drawn it must be\r\nremembered entirely from the section of the baronage most extreme in\r\ntheir views and most unfriendly to John, seems to have been completely\r\nlost. If we may believe Matthew Paris,[55] a second body or committee of\r\nthirty-eight barons was nominated, representing other and more moderate\r\nsections of the baronage, to act as a check on the otherwise\r\nall-powerful oligarchy of twenty-five despots. If this second committee\r\nwas ever really appointed, no details have been preserved as to the date\r\nof its selection, or as to the exact powers entrusted to it.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 55:\r\n\r\n  _Chron. Maj._, II. 605-6.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIf the rebel leaders expected to arrive at a permanent settlement of\r\ntheir disputes when they came to meet the King on the morning of the\r\n15th day of June, it must have been evident to all before the 23rd, that\r\nJohn only made the bargain in order to gain time and strength to break\r\nit. Three weeks, indeed, before John granted Magna Carta, he had begun\r\nhis preparations for its repudiation. In a letter of 29th May, addressed\r\nto the Pope, there may still be read his own explanation of the causes\r\nof quarrel, and how he urged, with the low cunning peculiar to him, that\r\nthe hostility of the rebels prevented the fulfilment of his vow of\r\ncrusade. In conclusion, he expressed his willingness to abide by the\r\nPope’s decision on all matters at issue.\r\n\r\nJohn, then, at Runnymede was merely waiting for two events which would\r\nput him in a position to throw off the mask—the favourable answer he\r\nconfidently expected from the Pope, and the arrival of foreign troops.\r\nMeanwhile, delay was doubly in his favour; since the combination formed\r\nagainst him was certain, in a short time, to break up. It was, in the\r\nhappy phrase of Dr. Stubbs,[56] a mere “coalition,” not an \"organic\r\nunion\"—a coalition, too, in momentary danger of dissolving into its\r\noriginal factors. The barons were without sufficient sinews of war to\r\ncarry a protracted struggle to a successful issue. Very soon, both sides\r\nto the treaty of peace were preparing for war. The northern barons,\r\nanticipating the King in direct breach of the compact, began to fortify\r\ntheir castles. John, in equally bad faith, wrote for foreign allies,\r\nwhilst he anxiously awaited the Pope’s answer to his appeal.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:\r\n\r\n  Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, II. 3.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nLangton and the bishops still struggled to restore harmony. The 16th\r\nJuly was fixed for a new conference. John did not attend; but it was\r\nprobably at this Council that in his absence a papal bull was read\r\nconferring upon a commission of three—the Bishop of Winchester, the\r\nAbbot of Reading, and the legate Pandulf—full powers to excommunicate\r\nall “disturbers of the King and Kingdom.” No names were mentioned, but\r\nthese powers might clearly be used against Langton and his friends. The\r\nexecution of this sentence was delayed, in the groundless hope of a\r\ncompromise, till the middle of September, when two of the commissioners,\r\nPandulf and Peter of Winchester, demanded that the Archbishop should\r\npublish it; and, on his refusal, they forthwith, in terms of their papal\r\nauthority, suspended him from his office. Stephen left for Rome, and his\r\nabsence at a critical juncture proved a national misfortune. The\r\ninsurgents lost in him, not only their bond of union, but also a\r\nwholesome restraint. His absence must be reckoned among the causes of\r\nthe royalist reaction soon to take place. After his departure, a papal\r\nbull arrived (in the end of September) dated 24th August. This is an\r\nimportant document in which Innocent, in the plainest terms, annuls and\r\nabrogates the Charter, after adopting all the facts and reproducing all\r\nthe arguments furnished by the King. Beginning with a full description\r\nof John’s wickedness and repentance, his surrender of England and\r\nIreland, his acceptance of the Cross, his quarrel with the barons; it\r\ngoes on to describe Magna Carta as the result of a conspiracy, and\r\nconcludes, “We utterly reprobate and condemn any agreement of this kind,\r\nforbidding, under ban of our anathema, the aforesaid king to presume to\r\nobserve it, and the barons and their accomplices to exact its\r\nperformance, declaring void and entirely abolishing both the Charter\r\nitself and the obligations and safeguards made, either for its\r\nenforcement or in accordance with it, so that they shall have no\r\nvalidity at any time whatsoever.”[57]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 57:\r\n\r\n  The original bull with the seal of Innocent still attached is\r\n  preserved in the British Museum (Cotton, Cleopatra E 1), and is\r\n  carefully printed by Bémont, _Chartes des Libertés Anglaises_, p. 41.\r\n  It may also be read _inter alia_ in Rymer and in Blackstone.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nA supplementary bull, of one day’s later date, reminded the barons that\r\nthe suzerainty of England belonged to Rome, and that therefore nothing\r\ncould be done in the kingdom without papal consent.[58] Thereafter, at a\r\nLateran Council, Innocent formally excommunicated the English barons who\r\nhad persecuted “John, King of England, crusader and vassal of the Church\r\nof Rome, by endeavouring to take from him his kingdom, a fief of the\r\nHoly See.”[59]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 58:\r\n\r\n  The text is given by Rymer.\r\n\r\nFootnote 59:\r\n\r\n  See Rymer, and Bémont, _Chartes_, xxv.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the points in dispute had been submitted to the rude\r\narbitrament of civil war, in which the first notable success fell to\r\nKing John in the capture, by assault, of Rochester Castle on 30th\r\nNovember. The barons had already made overtures to Louis, the French\r\nKing’s son, to whom they promised as a reward for his help, yet not\r\nperhaps with entire sincerity, the crown of England. Towards the end of\r\nNovember, some seven thousand French troops arrived in London, where\r\nthey spent the winter—a winter consumed by John in marching from place\r\nto place meeting, on the whole, with success, especially in the east of\r\nEngland. John’s best ally was the Pope, who had no intention of allowing\r\na French Prince to usurp the throne of one who was now his humble\r\nvassal. Gualo was dispatched from Rome to Philip, King of France,\r\nforbidding his son’s invasion, and asking rather protection and\r\nassistance for John as a papal vassal. Philip, anxious to meet the force\r\nof the Pope’s arguments with some title to intervene, of more weight\r\nthan the invitation of a group of rebels, replied by an ingenious string\r\nof fictions. He endeavoured to find defects in John’s title as King of\r\nEngland, and to argue that therefore John was not _in titulo_ to grant\r\nto the Pope the rights of an overlord. Among other arguments it was\r\nurged that John had been convicted of treason while Richard was King,\r\nand that this sentence involved forfeiture by the traitor of all rights\r\nof succession to the Crown. Thus the Pope’s claim of intervention was\r\ninvalid, while Prince Louis justified his own interference by some\r\nimagined right which he ingeniously argued had passed to him through the\r\nmother of his wife.\r\n\r\nJohn had not relied solely on papal protection. A great fleet, collected\r\nat Dover to block Louis with his smaller vessels in Calais harbour, was\r\nwrecked on 18th May, 1216. The channel thus cleared of English ships,\r\nthe French Prince, setting sail on the night of the 20th May, landed\r\nnext morning without opposition. John, reduced to dependence on\r\nmercenaries, did not dare oppose his landing. Gualo, now in England, on\r\n28th May excommunicated Louis by name, and laid London under interdict.\r\nSuch thunderbolts had now lost their blasting power by frequent\r\nrepetition, and produced no effect whatever. On 2nd June, Louis entered\r\nLondon amid acclamations, and marched against John at Winchester, which\r\nhe reached on 14th June, after John had fled. Ten days later, the\r\nancient capital of Wessex with its castles surrendered. Next day, the\r\nFrench Prince attacked Dover, whose brave defender, Hubert de Burgh,\r\nafter some months of stubborn resistance, obtained a truce, on 14th\r\nOctober, in order that the garrison might communicate with the King.\r\nBefore Hubert’s messengers could reach him, John was dying. During these\r\nmonths, when the verdict of war was going against him in the south, he\r\nhad been acting in the north strenuously, and not without success. The\r\nissue still trembled in the balance. A royalist reaction had begun. The\r\ninsolence of the French troops caused desertions from the barons.\r\n\r\nOn 10th October John, after being feasted to excess by the loyal\r\nburghers of Lynn, fell into an illness from which he never really\r\nrecovered. Nine days later, worn out by his wars, and by excitement and\r\nchagrin, at this critical juncture when fortune might have taken any\r\nsudden turn, he died at Newark Castle, in the early hours of the morning\r\nof 19th October, 1216. His death saved the situation, rendering a\r\ncompromise possible. Almost immediately, there took place an entirely\r\nnew grouping of political forces inside and outside of England. A silent\r\ncompromise was effected, all parties returning gradually to their\r\nnatural allegiance to the son of John, on the understanding that the\r\nCharter in its main features should be accepted as the basis of his\r\ngovernment. Prince Louis was soon discarded. Rome also fell into line;\r\nthe death of Innocent, on 16th June, 1216, had been equally opportune\r\nwith the death of John, four months later, removing an obstacle from the\r\npath of peace. Gualo, in the name of Innocent’s successor, consented to\r\nthe re-issue of the Charter by the advisers of the young King Henry.\r\n\r\n                                PART II.\r\n                   FEUDAL GRIEVANCES AND MAGNA CARTA.\r\n\r\n                 I. The Immediate Causes of the Crisis.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to explain why the storm, long brewing,\r\nbroke at last in 1214, and culminated precisely in June of the following\r\nyear. Sir William Blackstone[60] shows how carefully historians have\r\nsought for some one specific feature or event, occurring in these years,\r\nof such moment as by itself to account for the rebellion crowned for the\r\nmoment with success at Runnymede. Thus Matthew Paris, he tells us,\r\nattributes the whole movement to the sudden discovery of Henry I.’s\r\ncharter, long forgotten as he supposes, while other chroniclers agree in\r\nassigning John’s inordinate debauchery as the cause of the civil\r\ndissensions, dwelling on his personal misdeeds, real and imaginary.\r\n“Sordida foedatur foedante Johanne, gehenna.”[61] Blackstone himself\r\nsuggests a third event, the appointment as Regent in John’s absence of\r\nthe hated alien and upstart, Peter des Roches, and his misconduct in\r\nthat office.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 60:\r\n\r\n  _The Great Charter_, p. vii.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThere is absolutely no necessity to seek in such trivial causes the\r\nexplanation of a great movement, really inevitable, the antecedents of\r\nwhich were deeply rooted in the past. The very success of Henry\r\nPlantagenet in performing the great task of restoring order in England,\r\nfor effecting which special powers had been allowed to him, made the\r\ncontinuance of these powers to his successors unnecessary. From the day\r\nof Henry’s death, if not earlier, forces were at work which only\r\nrequired to be combined in order to control the licence of the Crown.\r\nWhen the battle of order had been finally won—the complete overthrow of\r\nthe rebellion of 1173 may be taken as a crucial date in this\r\nconnection—the battle of liberty had, almost necessarily, to be begun.\r\nThe clamant problem of the hour was no longer how to prop up the\r\nweakness of the Crown; but rather how to place restrictions on its\r\nunbridled strength.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 61:\r\n\r\n  Several of the most often-repeated charges of personal wrongs\r\n  inflicted by King John upon the wives and daughters of his barons have\r\n  been in recent years refuted. See Miss Norgate, _John Lackland_, p.\r\n  289.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWe need not wonder that the crisis came at last, but rather why it was\r\nso long delayed. Events, however, were not ripe for rebellion before\r\nJohn’s accession, and a favourable occasion did not occur previous to\r\n1215. The doctrine of momentum accounts in politics for the long\r\ncontinuance of old institutions in a condition even of unstable\r\nequilibrium; an entirely rotten system of government may remain for ages\r\nuntil at the destined moment comes the final shock. John conferred a\r\ngreat boon on future generations, when by his arrogance and by his\r\nmisfortunes he combined against him all classes and interests in the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nThe chief factor in the coalition which ultimately triumphed over John\r\nwas undoubtedly the baronial party led by those strenuous nobles of the\r\nnorth, who were, beyond doubt, goaded into active opposition by their\r\nown personal and class wrongs, not by any altruistic promptings to\r\nsacrifice themselves for the common good. Their complaints, too, as they\r\nappear reflected in the imperishable record of Magna Carta, are mainly\r\ngrounded on breaches of the technical rules of feudal usage, not upon\r\nthe broad basis of constitutional principle.\r\n\r\nThe feudal grievances most bitterly resented may be ranged under one or\r\nother of two heads—increase in the weight of feudal obligations and\r\ninfringement, of feudal jurisdictions. The Crown, while it exacted from\r\nits tenants the fullest measure of services legally exigible, interfered\r\npersistently at the same time with those rights and privileges which had\r\noriginally balanced the obligations. The barons were compelled to give\r\nmore, while they received less.\r\n\r\nWith the first group of baronial grievances posterity can sympathize in\r\na whole-hearted way, since the increase of feudal obligations inflicted\r\nundoubted hardships on the Crown tenants, while the redress of these\r\ninvolved no real danger to constitutional progress. One and all of the\r\ngrievances included in this first group could be condemned (as they were\r\ncondemned by various chapters of Magna Carta) without unduly reducing\r\nthe efficiency of the monarchy which still formed under John, as it had\r\ndone under William I., the sole source of security against the dangers\r\nof feudal anarchy. Posterity, however, cannot equally sympathize with\r\nthe efforts of the barons to redress their second class of wrongs.\r\nHowever great may have been the immediate hardships inflicted on members\r\nof the aristocracy by the suppression of their feudal courts, lovers of\r\nconstitutional progress can only rejoice that all efforts to restore\r\nthem failed. Those clauses of Magna Carta which aimed at reversing the\r\ngreat currents flowing towards royal justice, and away from private\r\nbaronial justice, produced no permanent effect, and posterity has had\r\nreason to rejoice in their failure.\r\n\r\nEach group of feudal grievances—those connected with the increase of\r\nfeudal obligations, and those connected with the curtailment of feudal\r\nimmunities—requires special and detailed treatment.[62] To each class a\r\ndouble interest attaches, since the resentment aroused by both formed so\r\nvital an element in the spread of that spirit of determined resistance\r\nto King John, which led to the winning of Magna Carta, and since,\r\nfurther, an intimate knowledge of the exact nature of these grievances\r\nthrows a flood of light on many otherwise obscure clauses of the Great\r\nCharter, and enables us to estimate how far the promised remedies were\r\nultimately carried into practice in later reigns.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 62:\r\n\r\n  See _infra_ the two sections (II. and III.) immediately following.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe grievances of the barons, many and varied as they were, were not,\r\nhowever, the only wrongs calling for redress. It is probable that the\r\nbaronial party, if they had acted in isolation from the other estates of\r\nthe realm, would have failed in 1215 as they had already failed in 1173.\r\nIf the Crown had retained the active sympathy of Church and common\r\npeople, John might have successfully defied the baronage as his father\r\nhad done before him. He had, on the contrary, alienated from the\r\nmonarchy all estates and interests, and had broadened the basis of\r\nopposition to the throne by ill-treating the mercantile classes and the\r\npeasantry who, from the reign of William I. to that of Henry II., had\r\nremained the fast, if humble, friends of the Crown. The order-loving\r\ntradesmen of the towns had been previously willing to purchase\r\nprotection from Henry at the price of heavy, even crushing taxation; but\r\nwhen John continued to exact the price, and yet failed to furnish good\r\ngovernment in return, his hold on the nation was completely lost. So far\r\nfrom protecting the humble from oppression, he was himself the chief\r\ncentral oppressor, and he let loose, besides, his foreign officers and\r\nfavourites as petty local oppressors in all the numerous offices of\r\nsheriff, castellan, and bailiff. Far from using the perfected machinery\r\nof Exchequer, Curia, and local administration in the interests of good\r\ngovernment, John valued them merely as instruments of extortion and\r\noutrage—as ministers to his lust and greed.\r\n\r\nThe lower orders were by no means exempt from the increased taxation\r\nwhich proved so galling to the feudal tenants. When John, during his\r\nquarrel with Rome, repaid each new anathema of the Pope by fresh acts of\r\nspoliation against the national Church, the sufferings of the clergy\r\nwere shared by the poor. In confiscating the goods of the monasteries,\r\nhe destroyed the chief provision for poor-relief known to the thirteenth\r\ncentury. The alienation of the affections of the great masses of\r\nlower-class Englishmen thus effected was never wholly undone, even by\r\nthe reconciliation of John with the Pope. Notwithstanding the\r\ncompleteness and even abjectness of John’s surrender to Rome, he took no\r\nspecial pains to reinstate himself in the good graces of the Church at\r\nhome. Innocent, secure at the Lateran, had issued his thunderbolts; and\r\nJohn’s counter-strokes had fallen, not on him, but on the English\r\nclergy—from the prelate to the parish priest, from the abbot to the\r\nhumblest monk. The measures taken, in 1213 and afterwards, to make good\r\nto these victims some part of the heavy losses sustained, were quite\r\ninadequate. The interests of the Church universal were often widely\r\ndifferent from those of the national Church, and such diversity was\r\nnever more clearly marked than in the last years of the reign of John.\r\n\r\nAfter 1213, John’s alliance with Rome brought new dangers in its train.\r\nThe united action of two tyrants, each claiming supreme powers, lay and\r\nspiritual respectively, threatened to exterminate the freedom of the\r\nEnglish nation and the English Church. “The country saw that the\r\nsubmission of John to Innocent placed its liberty, temporally and\r\nspiritually, at his mercy; and immediately demanded safeguards.”[63]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 63:\r\n\r\n  Stubbs, _Select Charters_, 270.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis union of tyrants naturally led to another union which checkmated\r\nit, for the baronial opposition allied itself with the ecclesiastical\r\nopposition. The urgency of their common need thus brought prelates and\r\nbarons into line—for the moment. The necessary leader was found in\r\nStephen Langton, who succeeded in preventing the somewhat divergent\r\ninterests of the two estates from leading them in opposite directions.\r\n\r\nAll things were thus ripe for rebellion, and even for _united_\r\nrebellion; an opportunity only was required. Such an opportunity came in\r\na tempting form in 1214; for the King had then lost prestige and power\r\nby his failure in the wars with France. He had lost the confidence of\r\nhis subjects by his quarrel with Rome, and he failed to regain it by his\r\nreconciliation. He had lost the friendship of the national Church. His\r\nunpopularity and vacillating nature had been thoroughly demonstrated.\r\nFinally he had himself, in 1191, when plotting against his absent\r\nbrother Richard, successfully attacked and ousted the Regent Longchamp\r\nfrom office, thus furnishing an example of rebellion, and of\r\nsuccessfully concerted action against the central government.\r\n\r\nThe result was that, when the barons—the wildest spirits of the northern\r\ncounties taking always the lead—began active operations at a juncture of\r\nJohn’s fortunes most favourable to their aspirations, not only had they\r\nno opposition to dread from churchman or merchant, from yeoman or\r\npeasant, but they might count on the sympathy of all and the active\r\nco-operation of many. Further, John’s policy of misrule had combined\r\nagainst him two interests usually opposed to each other, the party of\r\nprogress and the party of reaction. The influence of each of these may\r\nbe clearly read in the various chapters of Magna Carta.\r\n\r\nThe progressive party consisted mainly of the heads of the more recently\r\ncreated baronial houses, men trained in the administrative methods of\r\nHenry II., who desired merely that the system of government they knew\r\nshould be properly enforced and carried out to its logical conclusions.\r\nThey demanded chiefly that the King should conduct the business of the\r\nExchequer and Curia according to the rules laid down by Henry II.\r\nRoutine and order under the new system were what this party desired, and\r\nnot a return to the unruly days of Stephen. Many of the innovations of\r\nthe great Angevin had now been loyally and finally accepted by all\r\nclasses of the nation; and these accordingly found a permanent\r\nresting-place in the provisions of the Great Charter. In temporary\r\nco-operation with this party, the usually rival party of reaction was\r\nwilling to act for the moment against the common enemy. There still\r\nexisted in John’s reign magnates of the old feudal school, who hoped to\r\nwrest from the weakened hand of the King some measure of feudal\r\nindependence. They had indeed accepted such reforms as suited them, but\r\nstill bitterly opposed many others. In particular, they resisted the\r\nencroachments of the royal courts of law which were gradually\r\nsuperseding their private jurisdictions. For the moment, John’s crafty\r\npolicy, so well devised to gain immediate ends, and so unwise in the\r\nlight of subsequent history, combined these two streams, usually ready\r\nto thwart each other, into a united opposition to his throne. Attacked\r\nat the same moment by the votaries of traditional usage and by the\r\nvotaries of reform, by the barons, the trading classes, and the clergy,\r\nno course was left him but to surrender at discretion. The movement\r\nwhich culminated at Runnymede may thus best be understood as the\r\nresultant of a number of different but converging forces, some of which\r\nwere progressive and some reactionary.\r\n\r\n                 II. The Crown and Feudal Obligations.\r\n\r\nAmong the many evils calling loudly for redress in England at the\r\ncommencement of the thirteenth century, none spoke with more insistent\r\nvoice than those connected with feudal abuses. The objection of the\r\nnorthern barons to pay the scutage demanded on 26th May, 1214, was the\r\nspark that fired the mine. The most prominent feature of the Charter is\r\nthe solicitude everywhere displayed to define the exact extent of feudal\r\nservices and dues, and to prevent these from being arbitrarily\r\nincreased. A somewhat detailed knowledge of feudalism and feudal\r\nobligations forms a necessary preliminary to any exact study of Magna\r\nCarta.\r\n\r\nThe precise relations of the Norman Conquest to the growth of feudalism\r\nin England are complicated, and have formed the subject of much\r\ncontroversy. The view now generally accepted, and with reason, is that\r\nthe policy of William the Conqueror accelerated the process in one\r\ndirection, but retarded it in another. Feudalism, regarded as a system\r\nof government, had its worst tendencies checked, if not eradicated, by\r\nthe great upheaval that followed the coming of Duke William; feudalism,\r\nconsidered as a system of land tenure, and as a social system, was, on\r\nthe contrary, formulated and developed. It is mainly as a system of land\r\ntenure that it falls here to be considered. Originally, the relationship\r\nbetween lord and tenant, dependent upon the double ownership of land (of\r\nwhich each was, in a different sense, the proprietor), implied\r\nobligations on both sides. The lord gave protection, while the tenant\r\nowed services of various sorts. It so happened, however, that, with the\r\nchanges wrought by time, the legal obligations of the lord ceased to be\r\nof much importance, while those of the vassal became more and more\r\nburdensome. The tenant’s obligations varied in kind and in extent with\r\nthe nature of the tenure. It is difficult to frame an exact list of the\r\nvarious tenures formerly recognized as distinct in English law: partly\r\nbecause the classical authors of different epochs, from Bracton to\r\nBlackstone, contradict each other; and partly because of the obscurity\r\nof the process by which these tenures were gradually differentiated. The\r\nword “tenure” originally meant “a holding” of any sort. Sir William\r\nBlackstone,[64] after explaining the dependent nature of all real\r\nproperty in England, thus proceeds: “The thing holden is therefore\r\nstyled a _tenement_, the possessors thereof _tenants_, and the manner of\r\ntheir possession a _tenure_.” Tenure thus comes to mean the conditions\r\non which a tenant holds real estate under his lord, and the number of\r\ntenures varies with the number of accepted types.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 64:\r\n\r\n  _Commentaries_, II. 59.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe ancient classification differs materially from that in use at the\r\npresent day. The modern English lawyer (unless of an antiquarian turn of\r\nmind) concerns himself only with three tenures: freehold (now\r\npractically identical with socage), copyhold and leasehold. The two\r\nlast-mentioned may be rapidly dismissed, as they were of little\r\nimportance in the eyes of Littleton, or of Coke: leasehold embraces only\r\ntemporary interests, such as those of a tenant-at-will or for a limited\r\nterm of years; while copyhold is the modern form of tenure into which\r\nthe old unfree villeinage has slowly ripened. The ancient writers were,\r\non the contrary, chiefly concerned with holdings both permanent and free\r\n(as opposed to leaseholds on the one hand and villeinage on the other).\r\nOf such free tenures seven at least may be distinguished in the\r\nthirteenth century, all of which have now come to be represented by the\r\nsame one of the three recognized modern tenures, namely, freehold or\r\nsocage. The free holdings existing in medieval England may be ranged\r\nunder the following heads, viz.: knight’s service, free socage,\r\nfee-farm, frankalmoin, grand serjeanty, petty serjeanty, and burgage.\r\n\r\n(1) _Knight’s Service._ Medieval feudalism had many aspects; it was\r\nalmost as essentially an engine of war as it was a system of\r\nland-holding. The normal return for which an estate was granted\r\nconsisted of the service in the field of a specific number of knights.\r\nThus the normal feudal holding was known as knight’s service, or tenure\r\nin chivalry—the conditions of which must be constantly kept in view,\r\nsince by these rules the relations between John and his recalcitrant\r\nvassals fell to be determined. When finally abolished at the\r\nRestoration, there fell with knight’s service, it is not too much to\r\nsay, the feudal system of land tenure in England. “Tenure by barony” is\r\nsometimes spoken of as a separate species, but may be more correctly\r\nviewed as a variety of tenure in chivalry.[65]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 65:\r\n\r\n  See Pollock and Maitland, _History of English Law_, I. 218.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(2) _Free Socage._ The early history of socage, with its division into\r\nordinary and privileged, is involved in obscurities which do not require\r\nto be unravelled for the purpose at present on hand. The services which\r\nhad to be returned for both varieties were not military but\r\nagricultural, and their exact nature, and amount varied considerably.\r\nAlthough not so honourable as chivalry, free socage was less burdensome\r\nin respect that two of the most irksome of the feudal incidents,\r\nwardship and marriage, did not apply. When knight’s service was\r\nabolished those who had previously held their lands by it, whether under\r\nthe Crown or under a mesne lord, were henceforward to hold in free\r\nsocage, which thus came to be the normal holding throughout England\r\nafter the Restoration.[66]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 66:\r\n\r\n  See Statute 12 Charles II. c. 24.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(3) _Fee-farm_ was the name applied to lands held in return for services\r\nwhich were neither military nor agricultural, but consisted only of an\r\nannual payment in money. The “farm” thus indicates the rent paid, which\r\napparently might vary without limit, although it was long maintained\r\nthat a fee-farm rent must amount at least to one quarter of the annual\r\nvalue. This error seems to have been founded on a misconstruction of the\r\nStatute of Gloucester.[67] Some authorities[68] reject the claims of\r\nfee-farm to rank as a tenure separate from socage; although chapter 37\r\nof Magna Carta seems to recognize the distinction.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 67:\r\n\r\n  See Pollock and Maitland, I. 274, n.\r\n\r\nFootnote 68:\r\n\r\n  Pollock and Maitland, I. 218.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(4) _Frankalmoin_ is the tenure by which pious founders granted lands to\r\nthe uses of a religious house. It was also the tenure on which the great\r\nmajority of glebe lands throughout England were held by the village\r\npriests, the parsons of parish churches. The grant was usually declared\r\nto have been made _in liberam eleemosinam_ or “free alms” (that is, as a\r\nfree gift for which no _temporal_ services were to be rendered).[69] In\r\nScots charters the return formally stipulated was _preces et lacrymae_\r\n(the prayers and tears of the holy men of the foundation for the soul of\r\nthe founder).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 69:\r\n\r\n  Littleton, II. viii. s. 133.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(5) _Grand serjeanty_ was a highly honourable tenure sharing the\r\ndistinctions and the burdensome incidents of knight’s service, but\r\ndistinct in this, that the tenant, in place of ordinary military duties,\r\nperformed some specific office in the field, such as carrying the King’s\r\nbanner or lance, or else acted as his constable or marshal or other\r\nhousehold officer in the palace, or performed some important service at\r\nthe coronation.[70]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 70:\r\n\r\n  Littleton, II. viii. s. 153.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAn often-quoted example of a serjeanty is that of Sir John Dymoke and\r\nhis family, who have acted as the Sovereign’s champions at successive\r\ncoronations from Richard II. to Queen Victoria, ready to defend the\r\nMonarch’s title to the throne, if questioned, by battle in the ancient\r\nform.\r\n\r\nGrand serjeanties were liable to wardship and marriage, as well as to\r\nrelief, but not, as a rule, to payment of scutage.[71] William Aguilon,\r\nwe are told by Madox,[72] \"was charged at the Exchequer with several\r\nescuages. But when it was found by Inquest of twelve Knights of Surrey\r\nthat he did not hold his lands in that county by military tenure, but by\r\nserjeanty of finding a Cook at the King’s coronation to dress victuals\r\nin the King’s kitchen, he was acquitted of the escuages.\"\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 71:\r\n\r\n  Littleton, II. viii. s. 158.\r\n\r\nFootnote 72:\r\n\r\n  _History of Exchequer_, I. 650, citing _Pipe Roll_ of 18 Henry III.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(6) _Petty serjeanty_ may be described in the words of Littleton as\r\n“where a man holds his lands of our lord the king to yield to him yearly\r\na bow or sword, or a dagger or a knife ... or to yield such other small\r\nthings belonging to war.”[73]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 73:\r\n\r\n  See Littleton, II. ix. s. 159. With this may be compared the\r\n  definition given in chapter 37 of Magna Carta, where John speaks of\r\n  land thus held by a vassal as “quam tenet de nobis per servitium\r\n  reddendi nobis cultellos, vel sagittas vel hujusmodi.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe grant of lands on such privileged tenures was frequently made in\r\nearly days on account of the special favour entertained by the King for\r\nthe original grantee, due, it might be, to the memory of some great\r\nservice rendered at a critical juncture to the King’s person or\r\ninterests. A few illustrative examples may be cited from the spirited\r\ndescription of a scholar whose accuracy can be relied upon. Serjeanties,\r\nas Miss Bateson tells us, \"were neither always military nor always\r\nagricultural, but might approach very closely the service of knights or\r\nthe service of farmers.... The serjeanty of holding the King’s head when\r\nhe made a rough passage across the Channel, of pulling a rope when his\r\nvessel landed, of counting his chessmen on Christmas Day, of bringing\r\nfuel to his castle, of doing his carpentry, of finding his potherbs, of\r\nforging his irons for his ploughs, of tending his garden, of nursing the\r\nhounds gored and injured in the hunt, of serving as veterinary to his\r\nsick falcons, such and many other might be the ceremonial or menial\r\nservices due from a given serjeanty.\"[74]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 74:\r\n\r\n  _Mediaeval England_, pp. 249-250. A similar tenure still exists in\r\n  Scotland under the name of \"blench\"—a tenure wherein the reddendo is\r\n  elusory, viz., the annual rendering of such small things as an arrow\r\n  or a penny or a peppercorn, “if asked only” (_si petatur tantum_).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn the days before legal definition had done its work, it must often\r\nhave been difficult to say on which side of the line separating Petty\r\nSerjeanties from Grand Serjeanties any particular holding fell.\r\nGradually, however, important and practical distinctions were\r\nestablished, making it necessary that the boundary should be defined\r\nwith accuracy. In particular, the rule was established that Petty\r\nSerjeanties, while liable for relief, were exempt altogether from the\r\nburdensome incidents of wardship and marriage, which Grand Serjeanties\r\nshared with lands held by ordinary Barony or Knight’s service.[75] Thus\r\nthe way was prepared for the practical identification of the Petty\r\nSerjeanties with ordinary socage at a later date.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 75:\r\n\r\n  Littleton, II. viii. s. 158.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(7) _Burgage_, confined exclusively to lands within free boroughs, is\r\nmentioned as a separate tenure by Littleton,[76] and his authority\r\nreceives support from the words of chapter 37 of Magna Carta. Our\r\nhighest modern authorities,[77] however, consider that it never acquired\r\nsufficiently distinct characteristics to warrant its acknowledgment as\r\nsuch. They treat it rather as a special variety of socage, used where\r\nthe tenants were the members of a corporation. If their opinion must be\r\naccepted for England, it follows that, from common antecedents, entirely\r\ndifferent results have developed in Scotland and in England\r\nrespectively. While, north of the Tweed, several of the well-established\r\nEnglish tenures have failed to make good their right to separate\r\nrecognition, burgage has established itself beyond a doubt. Even the\r\nlevelling process consummated by the Conveyancing (Scotland) Act of 1874\r\nhas not entirely abolished its separate existence.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 76:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, II. x. s. 162.\r\n\r\nFootnote 77:\r\n\r\n  Pollock and Maitland, I. 218.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe explanation of such differences between English and Scottish usage\r\neasily suggests itself. When feudalism first took root, the various\r\nshades of distinction in the conditions of holding were exceedingly\r\nnumerous, and merged into one another by imperceptible degrees. The work\r\nof definition came later, was essentially artificial in its nature, and\r\nassumed different forms in different lands.[78]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 78:\r\n\r\n  Littleton and Coke seem almost to countenance two additional tenures,\r\n  viz., tenure by scutage or escuage, and tenure by Castle-guard.\r\n  Pollock and Maitland consider both as alternative names for knight’s\r\n  service. (See I. 251 and I. 257.) The latter is discussed _infra_\r\n  under c. 29 of Magna Carta.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThese tenures, originally six or seven (according as we exclude or\r\ninclude burgage), have yielded to the unifying pressure of many\r\ncenturies. Frankalmoin and Grand Serjeanty still exist, but rather as\r\nghosts than realities; the others have all been swallowed up in socage,\r\nwhich has thus become practically identical with “free-hold.”[79] This\r\ntriumph of socage is the result of a long process. Fee-farm, burgage,\r\nand petty serjeanty, always possessing many features in common, were\r\ngradually assimilated in almost all respects, while a statute (12\r\nCharles II. c. 24) transformed tenure in chivalry also into socage. The\r\nonce humble socage has thus risen high, and now embraces most of the\r\nland of England.[80]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 79:\r\n\r\n  Jenks, _Modern Land Law_, p. 14.\r\n\r\nFootnote 80:\r\n\r\n  It has been well described by Pollock and Maitland (I. 294) as “the\r\n  great residuary tenure.” In Scotland the “residuary tenure” is not\r\n  socage but “feu” (resembling the English fee-farm). Holdings in feu\r\n  are still familiar to Scots lawyers. They are originated by a formal\r\n  charter, followed by registration (the modern equivalent of infeftment\r\n  or feudal investiture), thus preserving an unbroken connection with\r\n  the feudal conveyancing of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nThe interest of historians naturally centres round tenure by knight’s\r\nservice, which is the very kernel of the feudal system. Lack of\r\ndefinition in the middle ages was a fruitful source of quarrel. For a\r\ncentury and more after the Norman Conquest, the exact amount and nature\r\nof the military services due by a tenant to his lord were left vague and\r\nundetermined. The early Norman Kings had gradually superseded the old\r\nAnglo-Saxon Crown tenants by new ones of Norman or French extraction,\r\nwithout formulating any code of regulations for the future. The whole of\r\nEngland had thus been carved into a number of estates—the larger known\r\nas honours or baronies, and the smaller as manors. Each Crown tenant\r\n(with two exceptions, of which the Conqueror’s favourite foundation of\r\nBattle Abbey was one) held his lands on condition of furnishing a\r\ncertain number of fully armed and mounted soldiers, always ready to obey\r\nthe King’s summons in the event of war. High authorities differ as to\r\nwhen and by whom the amount of each vassal’s service was fixed. The\r\ncommon view (promulgated by Prof. Freeman[81] with his usual vehemence),\r\nattributes the allocation of specific service to Ranulf Flambard, the\r\nunscrupulous tool of William Rufus. Mr. J. H. Round[82] has recently\r\nurged convincing reasons in support of the older view which attributes\r\nit to William I. Two facts, apparently, are certain: that within half a\r\ncentury from the Conquest each military tenant was burdened with a\r\ndefinite amount of knight’s service; and, further, that no formal record\r\nof the amount of such service was made at the time. There were, as yet,\r\nno written charters, and thus the possibility of disputes remained.\r\nProbably such grants would be made in full _Curia_, and the only record\r\nof the conditions would lie in the memory of the Court itself.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 81:\r\n\r\n  _Norman Conquest_, V. 377; _Hist. of William Rufus_, 335–7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 82:\r\n\r\n  _Feudal England_, p. 228 _et seq._\r\n\r\nLong before the date of Magna Carta, the various obligations had been\r\ngrouped into three classes, which may be arranged according to their\r\nrelative importance, as _services_, _incidents_, and _aids_. Under each\r\nof these three heads, disputes continually arose between the lord who\r\nexacted and the vassal who rendered them.[83]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 83:\r\n\r\n  All three forms of feudal obligation—service, incidents, and aids—have\r\n  long been obsolete in England. The statute 12 Charles II. c. 24 swept\r\n  away the feudal _incidents_ along with the feudal system; centuries\r\n  before, _scutages_ in lieu of military _service_ had become obsolete\r\n  in the transition from the system of feudal finance to that of\r\n  national finance, effected by the Crown in the thirteenth and\r\n  fourteenth centuries. Feudal _aids_ were also long obsolete, although\r\n  James I., in desperate straits for money, had attempted to revive two\r\n  of them. In France the feudal system, with all its burdensome\r\n  obligations, remained in full vigour until it was abolished in one\r\n  night by the famous decree of the National Assembly of 4th August,\r\n  1790. In Scotland, the feudal system of land tenure still exists, and\r\n  certain of its incidents (_e.g._ reliefs and compositions or fines for\r\n  alienation) are exacted at the present day.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe very essence of the feudal relation between the King as overlord and\r\nthe Crown tenant as vassal consisted in the liability of the latter to\r\nrender “suit and service,” that is, to follow his lord’s banner in time\r\nof war, and to attend his court in time of peace. It will be more\r\nconvenient, however, to reserve full consideration of these services\r\nuntil the comparatively uncomplicated obligations known as incidents and\r\naids have been first discussed.\r\n\r\nI. _Feudal Incidents._ In addition to “suit and service,” the lord\r\nreaped, at the expense of his tenants, a number of casual profits, which\r\nthus formed irregular supplements to his revenue. These profits,\r\naccruing, not annually, but on the occurrence of exceptional events,\r\ncame to be known as “feudal incidents.” They were gradually defined with\r\nmore or less accuracy, and their number may be given as six, viz.:\r\n\r\nReliefs, Escheats, Wardships, Marriages, Primer seisins, and Fines for\r\nAlienation.[84]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 84:\r\n\r\n  Blackstone, _Commentaries_, II. 63, however arranges these in a\r\n  different order, and mentions as a seventh incident “aids,” which are\r\n  here reserved for separate treatment.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Relief_ is easily explained. The fee, or _feudum_, or hereditary\r\nfeudal estate, seems to have been the result of a gradual evolution from\r\nthe old _beneficium_ (or estate held merely for one lifetime), and that\r\nagain from the older _precarium_ (or estate held only during the will of\r\nthe overlord). Grants of land, originally subject to revocation by the\r\nlord, had gradually attained fixity of tenure throughout the life of the\r\noriginal grantee; and, later on, they became transmissible to his\r\ndescendants. The hereditary principle at last completely triumphed; the\r\nCapitulary of Kiersey (A.D. 877) is said to be the first authoritative\r\nrecognition of the heir’s absolute right to succeed. The process was a\r\ngradual one, and it would seem that even after the Norman Conquest, this\r\nrule of hereditary descent was not established beyond possibility of\r\ndispute.[85] This right of the heir to succeed always remained subject\r\nto one condition, namely, the payment of a sum of money known as\r\n“relief.” This was theoretically an acknowledgment that the new tenant’s\r\nright to ownership was incomplete, until recognized by his superior—a\r\nreminiscence of the earlier _precarium_ from which the _feudum_ had\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 85:\r\n\r\n  See Pollock and Maitland, I. 296.\r\n\r\n_Relief_, then, is the sum payable to a feudal overlord by an heir for\r\nrecognition of his title to succeed the last tenant in possession. The\r\namount remained long undefined, and the lord frequently asked exorbitant\r\nsums.[86]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 86:\r\n\r\n  See _infra_, under c.2, for the steps in the gradual process whereby\r\n  this evil was redressed.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Escheat_, it has been said, \"signifies the return of an estate to\r\na lord, either on failure of issue from the tenant or upon account of\r\nsuch tenant’s felony.\"[87] This lucid description conveys a good general\r\nconception of escheat; but it is inaccurate in at least two respects. It\r\ndoes not exhaust the occasions on which escheat occurs, and it errs in\r\nspeaking of “the return” of an estate to a lord, when, more accurately,\r\nthat estate had never left him, but always remained his property,\r\nsubject only to a burden, which was now removed. In theory, the feudal\r\ngrant of lands was always conditional; and when the condition was\r\nbroken, the grant fell, and the lord found himself, automatically as it\r\nwere, once more the absolute unburdened proprietor, as he had been\r\nbefore the grant was made. Thereafter, he held the land in demesne,\r\nunless he chose to make a new grant to another tenant. The word\r\n“escheat” was applied indifferently to the lord’s right to such\r\nreversions, and to the actual lands which had thus reverted. In warlike\r\nand unsettled times the right was a valuable one, for whole families\r\nmight become rapidly extinct. When the last tenant left no heir, it was\r\nobvious that the original grant had exhausted itself. Similarly, when a\r\nlandholder was convicted of felony, his blood became, in the phrase of a\r\nlater day, attainted, and no one could succeed to any estate through\r\nhim. If a man failed in the ordeal of water provided by the Assize of\r\nClarendon in 1166 for those accused of heinous crimes, his estates also\r\nescheated to his lord. It is true that a complication arose when it was\r\nof treason that the tenant had been convicted. In that case the king, as\r\nthe injured party, had prior rights which excluded those of the lord.\r\nThe lands of traitors were forfeited to the Crown. Even in the case of\r\nfelony the king had a limited right to the lands during a period which\r\nwas strictly defined by Magna Carta.[88]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 87:\r\n\r\n  R. Thomson, _Magna Charta_, p. 236.\r\n\r\nFootnote 88:\r\n\r\n  _Infra_, c. 32.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe tenant’s felony and failure of issue were the two main grounds of\r\nescheat, but not the only ones; the goods of fugitives from justice and\r\nof those who had been formally outlawed also escheated, and Glanvill\r\nadds another case,[89] namely, female wards guilty of unchastity (an\r\noffence which spoiled the king’s market). Failure to obey a summons to\r\nthe feudal levy in time of war might also be made a ground of\r\nforfeiture.[90]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 89:\r\n\r\n  VII. 17.\r\n\r\nFootnote 90:\r\n\r\n  Madox, I. 663.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nEscheat was thus a peculiarly valuable right both to the Crown and to\r\nmesne lords. Its effect was simply this: one link in the feudal chain\r\nwas struck out, and the links on either side were fitted together. If\r\nthe defaulter was a Crown tenant, all his former sub-tenants, whether\r\nfreeholders or villeins, moved up one rung in the feudal ladder and held\r\nhenceforward directly of the king, who enjoyed the entire complexus of\r\nlegal rights previously enjoyed by the defaulter in addition to those\r\npreviously enjoyed by himself: rents, crops, timber, casual profits, and\r\nadvowsons of churches falling vacant; jurisdictions and the profits of\r\njurisdictions; services of villeins; reliefs, wardships, and marriages\r\nof freeholders as these became exigible.\r\n\r\nThe Crown, however, while taking everything the defaulter might have\r\ntaken before default, must take nothing more—so at least Magna Carta[91]\r\nprovides. The rights and status of innocent sub-tenants must not be\r\nprejudiced by the misdeeds of their defaulting mesne lord.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 91:\r\n\r\n  See _infra_, c. 43.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Wardships_ are described in the _Dialogus de Scaccario_ as\r\n“escheats along with the heir” (_escaeta cum herede_).[92] This\r\nexpression does not occur elsewhere, but it would be impossible to find\r\nany description of wardship which throws more light on its nature and\r\nconsequences. When the heir of a deceased tenant was unfitted to bear\r\narms by reason of his tender years, the lands were practically, during\r\nhis minority, without an effective owner. The lord accordingly treated\r\nthem as temporarily escheated. During the interval of nonage, the lord\r\nentered into possession, drew the revenues, and applied them to his own\r\npurposes, subject only to the obligation of maintaining and training the\r\nheir in a manner suited to his station in life. Frequently, considerable\r\nsums were thus spent. The _Pipe Roll_ of the seventeenth year of Henry\r\nII. shows how out of a total revenue of £50 6s. 8d. from the Honour of\r\n“Belveeir,” £18 5s. had been expended on the children of the late\r\ntenant.[93] Wardship came to an end with the full age of the ward, that\r\nis, in the case of a military tenant, on the completion of his\r\ntwenty-first year, “in that of a holder in socage on the completion of\r\nthe fifteenth, and in the case of a burgess when the boy can count\r\nmoney, measure cloth, and so forth.”[94] Wardship of females normally\r\nended at the age of fourteen, \"because that a woman of such age may have\r\na husband able to do knight’s service.\"[95]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 92:\r\n\r\n  See Hughes’ edition, p. 133.\r\n\r\nFootnote 93:\r\n\r\n  See _Dialogus_, p. 222 (citing _Pipe Roll_, p. 27).\r\n\r\nFootnote 94:\r\n\r\n  Glanvill, VII. c. 9. In socage and burgage tenures no incident of\r\n  wardship was recognized; the guardianship went to the relations of the\r\n  ward, and not to his feudal lord. Somewhat complicated, but\r\n  exceedingly equitable, rules applied to socage. The maternal kindred\r\n  had the custody, if the lands came from the father’s side; the\r\n  paternal kindred, if from the mother’s side (Glanvill, VII. c. 11). In\r\n  plain language, the boy and his property were entrusted to those who\r\n  had no interest in his death.\r\n\r\nFootnote 95:\r\n\r\n  Littleton, II. iv. s. 103.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAll the remunerative consequences flowing from escheat flowed also from\r\nwardship—rents, casual profits, advowsons, services of villeins, and\r\nreliefs. Unlike escheats, however, the right of the Crown here was only\r\ntemporary, and Magna Carta sought[96] to provide that the implied\r\nconditions should be respected by the Crown’s bailiffs or nominees. The\r\nlands must not be wasted or exhausted, but restored to the young owner\r\nwhen he came of age in as good condition as they had been at the\r\ncommencement of the wardship.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 96:\r\n\r\n  See under c. 5.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOne important aspect of this right ought to be specially emphasized. The\r\nCrown’s wardship affected bishoprics as well as lay baronies, extending\r\nover the temporalities of a See between the death of one prelate and the\r\ninstalment of his successor. Thus, it was to the king’s interest to\r\nplace obstacles in the way of all appointments to vacant sees, since the\r\nlonger the delay, the longer the Exchequer drew the revenues and casual\r\nprofits.[97]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 97:\r\n\r\n  What these were may be read in the _Pipe Rolls_, _e.g._, in that of 14\r\n  Henry II., when the Bishopric of Lincoln was vacant.\r\n\r\nThis right was carefully reserved to the Crown, even in the very\r\ncomprehensive charter in which John granted freedom of election, dated\r\n21st November, 1214.[98]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 98:\r\n\r\n  See _Statutes of the Realm, Ch. of Liberties_, p. 5, and _Sel.\r\n  Charters_, p. 288: “Salva nobis et haeredibus nostris custodia\r\n  ecclesiarum et monasteriorum vacantium quae ad nos pertinent.”\r\n  Contrast the terms of Stephen’s Oxford Charter; _Sel. Charters_, pp.\r\n  120-1.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Marriage_ as a feudal incident belonging to the lord is difficult\r\nto define generally, since its meaning changed. Originally it seems to\r\nhave implied little more than the right of a lord to forbid an heiress,\r\nholding a fief under him, to marry a personal enemy, or some one\r\notherwise unsuitable. Such veto was only reasonable, since the husband\r\nof the heiress would become the owner of the fee and the tenant of the\r\nlord. This negative right had almost necessarily a positive side; the\r\nclaim to concur in the choice of a husband gradually expanded into an\r\nabsolute right of the lord to dispose by sale or otherwise of the lands\r\nand person of his female ward. The prize might go as a bribe to any\r\nunscrupulous gentleman of fortune who placed his sword at the King’s\r\ndisposal, or it might be made the subject of auction to the highest\r\nbidder. The lady passed as a mere adjunct to her own estates, and\r\nceased, strictly speaking, to have any voice in choosing a partner for\r\nlife. She might protect herself indeed against an obnoxious husband by\r\nout-bidding her various suitors. Large sums were frequently paid for\r\nleave to marry a specified individual or to remain single.\r\n\r\nThis right seems, at some uncertain date, to have been extended from\r\nfemales to males, and instances of sums thus paid occur in the _Pipe\r\nRolls_. It is difficult at first sight to imagine how the Crown found a\r\nmarket for such wares as male wards; but probably wealthy fathers were\r\nready to purchase desirable husbands for their daughters. Thus in 1206 a\r\ncertain Henry of Redeman paid forty marks for the hand and lands of the\r\nheir of Roger of Hedon, “_ad opus filiae suae_,”[99] while Thomas Basset\r\nsecured a prize in the person of the young heir of Walerand, Earl of\r\nWarwick, to the use of any one of his daughters.[100] This extension to\r\nmale heirs is usually explained to have been founded on a strained\r\nconstruction of chapter 6 of Magna Carta, but the beginnings of the\r\npractice can be traced much earlier than 1215.[101] The lords’ right to\r\nsell their wards was recognized and defined by the Statute of Merton,\r\nchapter 6. The attempts made to remedy some of the most serious abuses\r\nof the practice may be read in Magna Carta.[102]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 99:\r\n\r\n  _Rotuli de oblatis et finibus_, p. 354.\r\n\r\nFootnote 100:\r\n\r\n  _Rot. Claus._, pp. 37, 55.\r\n\r\nFootnote 101:\r\n\r\n  Pollock and Maitland, I. 305.\r\n\r\nFootnote 102:\r\n\r\n  See _infra_, under chapters 6, 7, and 8.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMr. Hallam[103] considers that “the rights, or feudal incidents, of\r\nwardship and marriage were nearly peculiar to England and Normandy,” and\r\nthat the French kings[104] never “turned this attribute of sovereignty\r\ninto a means of revenue.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 103:\r\n\r\n  _Middle Ages_, II. 429.\r\n\r\nFootnote 104:\r\n\r\n  p. 437.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Primer Seisin_, which is usually regarded as a separate incident,\r\nand figures as such in Blackstone’s list, is perhaps better understood,\r\nnot as an incident at all, but rather as a special procedure—effective\r\nand summary—whereby the Crown could enforce the four incidents already\r\ndescribed. It was an exclusive prerogative of the Crown, denied to mesne\r\nlords.[105] When a Crown tenant died, the King’s officers had the right\r\nto enter upon immediate possession, and to exclude the heir, who could\r\nnot touch his father’s lands without specific permission from the Crown.\r\nHe had first to prove his title by inquest, to give security for any\r\nbalance of relief and other debts unpaid, and to perform homage.[106] It\r\nwill be readily seen what a strong strategic position all this assured\r\nto the King in any disputes with the heir of a dead vassal. If the\r\nExchequer had doubtful claims against the deceased, its officials could\r\nsatisfy themselves before admitting the heir to possession. If the heir\r\nshowed any tendency to evade payment of feudal incidents, the Crown\r\ncould checkmate his moves. If the succession was disputed, the King\r\nmight favour the claimant who pleased or paid him most; or, under colour\r\nof the dispute, refuse to disgorge the estate altogether—holding it in\r\ncustody analogous to wardship, and meanwhile drawing the profits. If the\r\nson and heir happened to be from home when his father died, he would\r\nprobably experience great difficulty, when he returned, in forcing the\r\nCrown to restore the estates. Such was the experience of William\r\nFitz-Odo on returning from Scotland in 1201 to claim his father’s\r\ncarucate of land in Bamborough.[107] Primer seisin was thus not so much\r\na separate incident, as a right peculiar to the Crown to take summary\r\nmeasures for the satisfaction of all incidents or other claims against a\r\ndeceased tenant or his heir. Magna Carta admitted this prerogative\r\nwhilst guarding against its abuse.[108]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 105:\r\n\r\n  The Bishop of Durham enjoyed it, so it seems to be stated in a charter\r\n  extorted from him in 1303 by the men of his fief (see Lapsley, _Pal.\r\n  of Durham_, p. 133). But this forms no real exception; since the\r\n  Bishop, as an Earl Palatine, enjoyed exceptionally the _regalia_ of a\r\n  king.\r\n\r\nFootnote 106:\r\n\r\n  See Pollock and Maitland, I. 292. It appears from statute of\r\n  Marlborough, c. 16, that _primer seisin_ extended over lands held by\r\n  serjeanty as well as by knight’s service.\r\n\r\nFootnote 107:\r\n\r\n  _Rotuli de oblatis_, p. 114.\r\n\r\nFootnote 108:\r\n\r\n  Sir Edward Coke (_Coke upon Littleton_, 77 A) is the original source\r\n  of much confusion as to the nature of primer seisin, which he seems to\r\n  have considered as a second and additional relief exacted by the Crown\r\n  amounting to the whole rent of the first year. The Popes, he further\r\n  held (equally erroneously), were only imitating this practice when\r\n  they exacted one year’s rent from every newly granted benefice under\r\n  the name of “first fruits.” These errors have been widely followed\r\n  (_e.g._ Thomson, _Magna Charta_, p. 416, Taswell Langmead, _Const.\r\n  Hist._, p. 50).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(_f_) _Fines for alienation_ occupy a place by themselves. Unlike other\r\nincidents already discussed, they became exigible not on the tenant’s\r\ndeath, but on his wishing to part with his estate to another during his\r\nown lifetime, either as a gift or in return for a price. How far could\r\nhe effect this without consent of his lord? This was, for many\r\ncenturies, a subject of frequent and heated disputes, often settled by\r\ncompromises, in which the tenant paid a fine to the lord for permission\r\nto sell. Such fines are payable at the present day in Scotland (under\r\nthe name of “compositions”) from feus granted prior to 1874; and, where\r\nno sum has been mentioned in the Feu Charter, the law of Scotland\r\ndefines the amount exigible as one year’s rent. John’s Magna Carta\r\ncontains no provisions on this subject. Disputes, long and bitter, took\r\nplace later in the thirteenth century; but their history is irrelevant\r\nto the present inquiry.[109]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 109:\r\n\r\n  See Taswell Langmead, _Const. Hist._, pp. 51-2; also Pollock and\r\n  Maitland, II. 326. _Cf._, however, c. 39 of the re-issue of Magna\r\n  Carta in 1217.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nII. _Feudal Aids._ The feudal tenant, in addition to fulfilling all the\r\nessentials of the feudal relation and also all the burdensome incidents\r\nalready enumerated, was expected to come to the aid of his lord in any\r\nspecial crisis or emergency. The help thus rendered was by no means\r\nreckoned as a payment to account of the other obligations, which had\r\nalso to be paid in full. The additional sums thus given were technically\r\nknown as “aids.” At first, the occasions on which these might be\r\ndemanded were varied and undefined. Gradually, however, they were\r\nlimited to three. Glanvill,[110] indeed, mentions only two, namely, the\r\nknighting of the overlord’s eldest son, and the marriage of his eldest\r\ndaughter; but he intends these, perhaps, merely as illustrations rather\r\nthan as forming an exhaustive list. Before the beginning of the\r\nthirteenth century the recognized aids were clearly three—the ransoming\r\nof the king and the two already mentioned. This understanding was\r\nembodied in Magna Carta.[111]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 110:\r\n\r\n  IX. c. 8.\r\n\r\nFootnote 111:\r\n\r\n  See _infra_, under chapter 12.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nA tradition has been handed down from an early date, that these aids\r\nwere in reality voluntary offerings made by the tenant as a mark of\r\naffection, and forming no part of his legal obligations.[112]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 112:\r\n\r\n  Thus, the Abingdon version of the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ (II. 113)\r\n  speaks of “auxilium quod barones michi dederunt”; while Bracton says\r\n  (Book II. c. 16, s. 8): “Auxilia fiunt de gratia et non de jure; cum\r\n  dependeant ex gratia tenentium, et non ad voluntatem dominorum.”\r\n\r\nThis plainly became, however, a legal fiction, as regarded the aids\r\nacknowledged by customary law; the tenant dared not refuse to pay the\r\nrecognized three. As regarded any further payments, it was by no means a\r\nfiction. When the Crown desired to exact contributions for any other\r\nreason, it required to obtain the consent of the _commune concilium_.\r\nThis, for example, was done by Henry III. before taking an aid on the\r\nmarriage of his eldest sister. The importance of the necessity for such\r\nconsent can hardly be exaggerated in its bearing on the origin of the\r\nrights of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Great Charter, while confirming the tacit compromise arrived at by\r\ncustom, whereby only the three aids might be taken without consent of\r\nthe baronage, left the _amount_ of such aids undefined, contenting\r\nitself with the extremely vague provision that they should be\r\n“reasonable.” Examples of such payments, both before and after the\r\nCharter, are readily found in the Exchequer Rolls. Thus, in the\r\nfourteenth year of Henry II., that king took one mark per knight’s fee\r\non marrying his daughter Maud to the Duke of Saxony. Henry III. took\r\n20s. and Edward I. 40s. for a similar purpose. For Richard’s ransom,\r\n20s. had been exacted from each knight’s fee (save those owned by men\r\nactually serving in the field); and Henry III. took 40s. in his\r\nthirty-eighth year at the knighting of his son. Probably there existed,\r\nat an early date, some understanding as to the limits within which\r\n“reasonableness” should be reckoned, but the amount was never stated in\r\nblack and white before the third year of Edward I. The Statute of\r\nWestminster I.[113] fixed the “reasonable” aid payable, not to the Crown\r\nbut, to mesne lords at 20s. per knight’s fee, and 20s. for every estate\r\nin socage of £20 annual value. This rate, it will be observed, is\r\none-fifth of the knight’s relief.[114] The Crown, in thus enforcing\r\n“reason” on mesne lords, seems never to have intended that the same\r\nlimit should hamper its own dealings with Crown tenants, but continued\r\nto exact larger sums whenever it thought fit.[115]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 113:\r\n\r\n  3 Edward I. c. 36.\r\n\r\nFootnote 114:\r\n\r\n  Fixed at 100s. by c. 2 of Magna Carta.\r\n\r\nFootnote 115:\r\n\r\n  One entry in the _Memoranda Roll_ of 42 Henry III. (cited Madox I.\r\n  615) seems at first sight to contradict this. It seems in that year to\r\n  be admitted that the Crown could not exact more than 20s. of aid per\r\n  knight’s fee; but in 1258 the baronial opposition would be strong in\r\n  the Exchequer as elsewhere.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThus £2 per fee was taken in 1346 at the knighting of the Black Prince.\r\nA Statute of Edward III.[116] at last extended to the Crown the same\r\nmeasure of “reasonableness” as had been applied three-quarters of a\r\ncentury earlier to mesne lords. The last instances of the exaction of\r\naids in England occur as late as the reign of James I., who, in 1609,\r\ndemanded one for the knighting of the ill-fated Prince Henry, and in\r\n1613 another for the marriage of his daughter Elizabeth to the Prince of\r\nOrange.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 116:\r\n\r\n  25 Ed. III. stat. 5, c. 11.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIII. _Suit and Service._ This phrase expresses the essential obligations\r\ninherent in the very nature of the feudal relation. It may be expanded\r\n(as regards tenure in chivalry) into the duty of attendance at the\r\nlord’s court, whether it met for administrative or judicial purposes, or\r\nfor reasons of mere display, and the further duty of military service\r\nunder that lord’s banner in the field. Suit, or attendance at court, had\r\nceased to be an urgent question before the reign of John. Indeed, the\r\nbarons, far from objecting to be present there, were gradually\r\napproaching the modern conception, which regards it as a privilege\r\nrather than a burden to attend the _commune concilium_—the embryo\r\nParliament—of the King. They urged, in especial, that only in a full\r\nfeudal court, at which each great Crown tenant had a right to appear,\r\ncould any one of their number be judged in a plea involving loss of\r\nlands or of personal status.[117]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 117:\r\n\r\n  See _infra_, under chapter 39.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt was far otherwise with the duties of military service, which were\r\nrendered every year more unwillingly, partly because of the increased\r\nfrequency of warlike expeditions, partly because of the greater cost of\r\ncampaigning in distant lands like Poitou, partly because the English\r\nbarons were completely out of sympathy with John’s foreign policy and\r\nwith him. We have seen that the want of definition and looseness of\r\npractice in the reign of William the Conqueror left to future ages a\r\nlegacy fertile in disputes. William I. and his barons lived in the\r\npresent; and the present did not urgently call for definition.\r\nTherefore, the exact duration of the military service to be rendered,\r\nand the exact conditions (if any) on which exemption could be claimed,\r\nwere left originally quite vague. Such carelessness is easily explained.\r\nBoth Crown and barons hoped that by leaving matters undefined, they\r\nwould be able to alter them to their own advantage. This policy was sure\r\nto lead to bitter quarrels in the future, but circumstances delayed\r\ntheir outbreak. The magnates at first readily followed William to the\r\nfield wherever he went, since their interests were identical with his,\r\nwhile warfare was their normal occupation.\r\n\r\nThe exact amount of military service was gradually fixed by custom, and\r\nboth sides acquiesced in reckoning the return due (_servitium debitum_)\r\nfor each knight’s fee or _scutum_ as the service of one fully armed\r\nhorseman during forty days. There were still, however, innumerable minor\r\npoints on which disputes might arise, and these remained even in 1215.\r\nIndeed, although several chapters of the Great Charter attempted to\r\nsettle certain of these disputed points, others were left as bones of\r\ncontention to subsequent reigns: for example, the exact equipment of a\r\nknight; the liability to serve for more than forty days on receiving pay\r\nfor the extra time; what extent of exemption (if any) might be claimed\r\nby churchmen holding baronies on the ground that they could not fight in\r\nperson; how far a tenant might compromise for actual service by\r\ntendering money; whether attendance and money might not both be refused,\r\nif the King did not lead his forces in person; and whether service was\r\nequally due from all estates for foreign wars as for home ones.[118]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 118:\r\n\r\n  Some of these questions might be answered in particular cases by the\r\n  terms of special charters. Thus the _Hundred Rolls_ (1279) relate how\r\n  Hugh de Plesens held the Manor of Hedington, and was liable for one\r\n  knight’s fee when scutage ran; that he must go with the King and serve\r\n  him for forty days at his own expense, and thereafter at the expense\r\n  of the King. _Rot. Hund._, II. p. 710; cf. for _France, Etablissements\r\n  de St. Louis_, I. c. 65.\r\n\r\nSuch difficulties were increased, as time went on, rather than removed.\r\nThe Conqueror’s followers had possessed, like their lord, estates on\r\nboth sides of the Channel: his wars were theirs. Before John’s reign,\r\nthese simple relations had become complicated by two considerations. By\r\nforfeitures and the division of inheritances between sons of one father,\r\nholders of English fiefs and holders of Norman fiefs had become\r\ndistinct; the English barons had in 1213 nothing at stake in the Crown’s\r\nselfish schemes of aggrandisement or defence. The England of John\r\nLackland, like the England of William of Orange, objected to be\r\nentangled in foreign wars in the interests of foreign possessions of the\r\nKing. On the other hand, the gradual expansion of the dominions of the\r\nwearers of the English Crown increased the number of their wars with the\r\nnumber of their interests, and increased, too, the trouble and expense\r\nof each expedition. The small wars with Wales and Scotland formed a\r\nsufficient drain on the resources of English magnates without their\r\nbeing summoned in intermediate years to fight in Maine or Gascony. The\r\ngreater number of campaigns might well be reckoned a breach of the\r\nspirit of the original agreement.\r\n\r\nWere the barons bound to follow John in a forlorn attempt, of which they\r\ndisapproved, to recover his lost fiefs from the French Crown? Or were\r\nthey bound to support him only in his legitimate schemes as King of\r\nEngland? Or were they, by way of compromise, liable for services in the\r\nidentical possessions held by William the Conqueror at the date when\r\ntheir ancestors first got their fiefs—that is, for wars in England and\r\nNormandy alone? Tenderness for legal subtleties or strict logic could\r\nhardly be expected from the malcontents of the northern counties,\r\nsmarting under a dumb sense of wrong. Despising all nice definition,\r\nthey declared roundly in 1213 that they owed no service whatsoever out\r\nof England.[119] This extreme claim put them clearly in the wrong, since\r\nJohn had many precedents to the contrary ready to lay before them. When\r\nthe King, on his return from his unfortunate expedition in 1214,\r\ndemanded a scutage from all who had not followed him to Poitou, the\r\nmalcontents declared that they had no obligation either to follow him\r\nout of the kingdom, or to pay a scutage in lieu thereof.[120] Pope\r\nInnocent was probably correct in condemning this contention as founded\r\nneither on English law nor on feudal custom.[121] There is some ground\r\nfor believing that a compromise was mooted on the basis that the barons\r\nshould agree to serve in Normandy and Brittany, as well as in England,\r\non being exempted from fighting elsewhere abroad.[122]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 119:\r\n\r\n  See R. Coggeshall, p. 167; the barons argued _non in hoc ei obnoxios\r\n  esse secundum munia terrarum suarum_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 120:\r\n\r\n  W. Coventry, II. 217.\r\n\r\nFootnote 121:\r\n\r\n  See his letter dated 1st April, 1215, in _New Rymer_, I. 128, ordering\r\n  the barons to pay the scutage of Poitou.\r\n\r\nFootnote 122:\r\n\r\n  The evidence for this is chiefly inferential, but would be greatly\r\n  strengthened if we could establish the genuineness of the charter\r\n  discussed by Mr. J. H. Round, Mr. Prothero, and Mr. Hubert Hall in\r\n  _Eng. Hist. Rev._, VIII. 288, and IX. 117 and 326. See the document in\r\n  Appendix.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nA definite understanding on this vital question was never arrived at—not\r\neven on paper, since chapter 16 of Magna Carta contented itself with the\r\nbald provision that existing services were not to be increased (without\r\ndefining what these were). This was merely to shelve the difficulty: the\r\ndispute went on under varying forms and led to a violent clashing of\r\nwills in the unseemly wrangle between Edward I. and his Constable and\r\nMarshal, dramatized in a classic passage by Walter of Hemingburgh.[123]\r\nStrangely enough, the _Confirmatio Cartarum_ of 1297, which was, in\r\npart, the outcome of this later quarrel, omits (like Magna Carta\r\nitself)[124] all reference to foreign service. The total omission from\r\nboth charters of all mention of the chief cause of dispute is\r\nnoteworthy. It must be remembered, however, that the question of\r\nliability to serve abroad had practically resolved itself into that of\r\nliability to scutage, and that chapters 12 and 14 of the Charter of 1215\r\nprovided an adequate check on the levy of all scutages; but this is a\r\nsubject of crucial importance, which requires separate and detailed\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 123:\r\n\r\n  _Chronicon_, II. 121.\r\n\r\nFootnote 124:\r\n\r\n  See, however, _infra_ under c. 16.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIV. _Scutage._ The Crown did not always insist on actual personal\r\nservice, but was frequently willing to accept a commutation in the form\r\nof a money payment. This subject of scutage is one of the most vexed of\r\nquestions; all received opinions of yesterday having to-day been thrown\r\ninto the melting pot. Serious attempts constructively to restate the\r\nwhole subject have hardly been made; and no conclusions have yet\r\nreceived general acceptance.\r\n\r\nThree modifications, however, of the theories of Stubbs and Freeman,\r\nonce universally accepted, seem likely to be soon established: (1) that\r\n“scutage” is an ambiguous term with a vague general meaning as well as a\r\nnarrow technical meaning; (2) that the importance of the changes\r\nintroduced by Henry II. in 1156 and 1159 has been much exaggerated; and\r\n(3) that at a later time, probably during John’s reign, scutage changed\r\nits character. It ceased to be normally a commutation of service, since\r\nit was not infrequently exacted by the Crown in _addition_ to military\r\nservice actually performed. Each of these propositions requires\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n“Scutagium,” or “shield-money,” often means, it is true, a specific sum\r\nof so much per knight’s fee (normally twenty shillings) accepted by the\r\nKing in lieu of the personal service in his army due by his tenants _in\r\ncapite_. Thus it is, as Dr. Stubbs explains, “an honourable commutation\r\nfor personal service”;[125] but it is also loosely used[126] to denote\r\nany exaction whatsoever assessed on a feudal basis (that is, taken\r\nexclusively from holders of fiefs) irrespective of the occasion of its\r\nlevy. Thus, money taken in name of one of the three feudal _aids_ is\r\nsometimes described as a scutage; and other instances might be cited.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 125:\r\n\r\n  Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, I. 632.\r\n\r\nFootnote 126:\r\n\r\n  As was long ago pointed out by Madox, I. 619.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAgain, learned opinion tends towards the belief that Henry II. made no\r\nradical or startling alteration. Professor Freeman, Dr. Stubbs, and\r\ntheir adherents familiarized a bygone generation of historians with the\r\nview that one of Henry’s most important reforms was to allow his Crown\r\ntenants at their discretion to substitute payments in money for the old\r\nobligation of personal service in the field—this option being granted to\r\necclesiastics in 1156, and to lay barons in 1159. Such a theory had _a\r\npriori_ much to recommend it. A measure of this nature, while giving\r\nvolume and elasticity to the resources of the Crown, was calculated\r\nsubtly to undermine the basis of the feudal tie; but Henry, farseeing\r\nstatesman as he was, could not discard the ideals of his own generation.\r\nNo evidence that he made any sweeping change is forthcoming. His\r\ngrandfather, Henry I., is shown by the evidence of extant charters to\r\nhave accepted money in place of the services of knights _when it suited\r\nhim_ (notably from church fiefs in 1109),[127] and there is no evidence\r\n(direct or indirect) to show that the grandson accepted such commutation\r\n_when it did not suit him_. The conclusions formulated, with his usual\r\nenergy, by Mr. J. Horace Round, lie implicitly in the examples from the\r\n_Pipe Rolls_ stored in the great work of Madox. From these it would\r\nappear that the procedure of the Exchequer of the great Angevin and his\r\ntwo sons might be explained in some such propositions as these:\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 127:\r\n\r\n  See Round, _Feudal England_, p. 268.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(_a_) The option to convert service into scutage lay with the Crown, and\r\nnot with the tenants, either individually or as a body. When the King\r\nsummoned his feudal army no baron could (as Professor Freeman would have\r\nus believe) simply stay away under obligation of paying a small fixed\r\nsum to the Exchequer. On the contrary, Henry and his sons jealously\r\npreserved the right to insist on _personal_ service whenever it suited\r\nthem; even efficient substitutes were not always accepted, much less\r\nmoney payments.\r\n\r\n(_b_) If the individual wished to stay at home he required to make a\r\nspecial bargain to pay such fine as the King agreed to accept—and\r\nsometimes he had to send a substitute in addition. The _Pipe Rolls_ show\r\nmany such payments by stay-at-homes _ne transfretent_ or _pro remanendo\r\nab exercitu_. Thus, in the twelfth year of John’s reign a Crown tenant\r\npaid a fine “that he might send two knights to serve for him in the army\r\nof Ireland.”[128]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 128:\r\n\r\n  Madox, I. 658.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSometimes, indeed, Henry II. might announce that payments at a certain\r\nrate would be accepted generally in lieu of service, but this was when\r\nit suited him, not when it suited his military tenants. In this\r\nconnection twenty shillings per fee became recognized as a usual, though\r\nby no means a necessary, rate.\r\n\r\n(_c_) In the ordinary case, if the tenant in chivalry neither went in\r\nperson nor obtained leave from the Crown to stay away, he was in evil\r\nplight. Defaulters were “_in mercy_”; they sometimes forfeited their\r\nentire estates to the Crown,[129] and might be glad to accept such terms\r\nof pardon as a gracious King condescended to hold out to them.\r\nSometimes, it is true, quite small amercements were inflicted; the Abbot\r\nof Pershore in 1196 escaped with an amercement of 40s.[130] Such\r\nleniency, however, was exceptional, and the result of special royal\r\nclemency.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 129:\r\n\r\n  See _Pipe Roll_ of 12 John, cited in Madox, I. 663.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 130:\r\n\r\n  See _Pipe Roll_ of Richard I., cited _ibid._\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe right to determine the amount of amercements to be taken lay within\r\nthe province of the Barons of the Exchequer, who also judged whether or\r\nnot lands had escheated by default.\r\n\r\nHenry II. seems to have levied money in name of scutage only when\r\nactually at war—on seven occasions in all during a reign of thirty-five\r\nyears; and only once at a rate exceeding 20s., if we may trust Mr.\r\nRound,[131] and that when he was putting forth a special effort against\r\nToulouse. Richard I., with all his rapaciousness, levied, apparently,\r\nonly four scutages during ten years, and the rate of 20s. was never\r\nexceeded even in the King’s hour of urgent need,—in 1194, when the\r\narrears of his ransom had to be paid and preparations simultaneously\r\nmade for war in Normandy.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 131:\r\n\r\n  _Feudal England_, 277 _seq._\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAt John’s accession, then, three rules might be regarded as having all\r\nthe prescriptive force of a long unbroken tradition, namely, (1) that\r\nscutage was a reserve for extraordinary emergencies, not a normal yearly\r\nburden; (2) that the recognized maximum was 20s. per knight’s fee, while\r\na lower rate (13s.4d. and even 10s.) had occasionally been accepted; and\r\n(3) that the payment of scutage to the King at a rate previously fixed\r\nby him acted as a complete discharge of all obligations due for that\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nIf it can be proved that John, almost from his accession, deliberately\r\naltered all three of these well-established rules, and that too in the\r\nteeth of the keen opposition of a high-spirited baronage whose members\r\nfelt that their pride and prestige as well as their money-bags were\r\nattacked, a distinct step is taken towards understanding the crisis of\r\n1215. Such knowledge would explain why a storm, long brewing, burst in\r\nJohn’s reign, neither sooner nor later; and even why some of the\r\ndisreputable stories told by the chroniclers and accepted by Blackstone\r\nand others, found inventors and willing believers.\r\n\r\nIt is here maintained that John did make changes in all three\r\ndirections; and, further, that the incidence of this increase in\r\nfeudal burdens was rendered even more unendurable by two\r\nconsiderations:—because at his accession there remained unpaid\r\n(particularly from the fiefs of the northern knights) large arrears of\r\nthe scutages imposed in his brother’s reign,[132] and because in June,\r\n1212, John drew the feudal chain tight by a drastic and galling\r\nmeasure. In that month he instituted a strict inquest into the amount\r\nof feudal service exigible from every estate in England, to prevent\r\nany dues escaping his wide net, and to revive all services and\r\npayments that had lapsed or were in danger of lapsing.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 132:\r\n\r\n  Miss Norgate, _John Lackland_, p. 122.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThat he made the first two changes becomes a certainty from a glance at\r\nthe table of scutages actually extorted during his reign, as these are\r\nhere copied from a list compiled by a writer of authority who has no\r\nspecial theory to support,[133] viz.:\r\n\r\n    First scutage of reign—   1198-9— 2    marks per knight’s fee.\r\n    Second    \"       \"       1200-1  2    \"               \"\r\n    Third     \"       \"       1201-2  2    \"               \"\r\n    Fourth    \"       \"       1202-3  2    \"               \"\r\n    Fifth     \"       \"       1203-4  2    \"               \"\r\n    Sixth     \"       \"       1204-5  2    \"               \"\r\n    Seventh   \"       \"       1205-6  20s.                 \"\r\n    Eighth    \"       \"       1209-10 2    marks           \"\r\n    Ninth     \"       \"       1210-11 2    \"               \"\r\n    Tenth     \"       \"       1210-11 20s.                 \"\r\n    Eleventh  \"       \"       1213-14 3    marks           \"\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 133:\r\n\r\n  Miss Norgate, _John Lackland_, p. 123 note, correcting Swereford’s\r\n  lists in the _Red Book of Exchequer_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that, in the very first year of his reign, John took a\r\nscutage, and that, too, at a rate above the established normal, at two\r\nmarks per _scutum_ (only once equalled, thirty years before, and then\r\nunder special circumstances). Even one such exaction must have made the\r\nalready sulky Crown tenants look askance.\r\n\r\nNext year John wisely allowed them breathing space; then without a break\r\nin each of the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh years of his\r\nreign, scutages were extorted in quick succession at the high rate of\r\ntwo marks. If John meant to establish this as a new normal rate, he did\r\nso not without some show of reason, since that would exactly pay the\r\nwages of a knight at 8d. _per diem_ (the rate then current), for a\r\nperiod of forty days (the exact term recognized by public opinion as the\r\nmaximum of compulsory feudal service).\r\n\r\n_Fines_, in addition to this scutage of two marks, were apparently\r\nexacted from those who had not made the necessary compromise for\r\npersonal service in due time.[134]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 134:\r\n\r\n  See (for year 1201) Ramsay, _Angevin Empire_, p. 390, and authorities\r\n  there cited.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThese scutages were collected with increasing difficulty, and arrears\r\ngradually accumulated; but the spirit of opposition increased even more\r\nrapidly. In 1206, apparently, the breaking point was almost\r\nreached.[135] Accordingly, in that year, some slight relaxation was\r\nallowed—the annual scutage was reduced from two marks to 20s. John’s\r\nneeds, however, were as great as ever, and would prevent all further\r\nconcessions in future years, unless something untoward happened.\r\nSomething untoward _did_ happen in the summer of 1207, when John\r\nquarrelled with the Pope. This event came in time, not as John thought\r\nto _prevent_, but, as the sequel proved, merely to _postpone_, the\r\ncrisis of the quarrel with the baronage. John had, for the time being,\r\nthe whole of the confiscated property of the clergy in his clutches. The\r\nday of reckoning for this luxury was still far distant, and the King\r\ncould meanwhile enjoy a full exchequer without goading his Crown tenants\r\nto rebellion. For three years no scutage was imposed. In 1209, however,\r\nfinancial needs again closed in on John, and a new scutage of two marks\r\nwas levied; followed in the next year actually by two scutages, the\r\nfirst of two marks against Wales, and the second of 20s. against\r\nScotland. John never knew when to stop. These three levies, amounting to\r\na total of five-and-a-half marks per fee within two years, strained the\r\ntension almost to breaking point.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 135:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Miss Norgate, _John Lackland_, p. 125.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nDuring the two financial years immediately following (Michaelmas, 1211,\r\nto Michaelmas, 1213) no scutage was imposed. John, however, although he\r\nthus a second time relaxed the tension, had no intention to do so for\r\nlong. On the contrary, he determined to ascertain if scutages could not\r\nbe made to yield more in the future. By writs, dated 1st June, 1212, he\r\ninstituted a great Inquest throughout the land. Commissioners were\r\nappointed to take sworn verdicts of local juries as to the amount of\r\nliability due by each Crown vassal. Mr. Round[136] considers that\r\nprevious writers have unaccountably ignored the importance of this\r\nmeasure, “an Inquest worthy to be named in future by historians in\r\nconjunction with those of 1086 and 1166,”[137] and describes it as an\r\neffort “to revive rights of the Crown alleged to have lapsed.” It is\r\npossible that John, by this Inquest of 1212, sought also\r\n(unsuccessfully, as the sequel proved) to do what Henry had done\r\nsuccessfully in 1166—that is, to increase the amount of knights’ fees on\r\nwhich each Crown tenant’s scutage was assessed by adding to the previous\r\ntotal the number of knights recently enfeoffed.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 136:\r\n\r\n  _Commune of London_, pp. 273-4.\r\n\r\nFootnote 137:\r\n\r\n  Two historians, however, who have recently given valuable and\r\n  independent accounts of the reign of John, say little of its value.\r\n  Sir James Ramsay (_Angevin Empire_, p. 432) treats it briefly, and\r\n  Miss Norgate (_John Lackland_, p. 163) barely notices it.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nJohn clearly intended by this Inquest, the returns to which were due on\r\nthe 25th June, 1212, to prepare the necessary machinery for wringing the\r\nuttermost penny out of the next scutage when occasion for one again\r\narose. That occasion came in 1214.\r\n\r\nUp to this date, even John had not dared to exact a rate of more than\r\ntwo marks per knight’s fee; but the weight of his constant scutages had\r\nbeen increased by the fact that he sometimes exacted personal services\r\nin addition, and that he inflicted crushing fines upon those who neither\r\nwent nor arranged beforehand terms of composition with the King.[138]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 138:\r\n\r\n  Miss Norgate (_John Lackland_, p. 123) describes the exactions\r\n  supplementing the scutages: \"These scutages were independent of the\r\n  fines paid by the barons who did not accompany the King on his first\r\n  return to Normandy in 1199, of the money taken from the host as a\r\n  substitute for its service in 1201, of the equipment and payment of\r\n  the ‘decimated’ knights in 1205, and the fines claimed from all the\r\n  tenants-in-chivalry after the dismissal of the host in the same year,\r\n  as well as of actual services which many of those who had paid the\r\n  scutage rendered in the campaigns of 1202-4 and 1206.\"\r\n\r\nThus gradually and insidiously throughout the entire reign of John, the\r\nstream of feudal obligations by many different channels steadily rose\r\nuntil the barons feared that nothing of their property would be saved\r\nfrom the torrent. The normal rate of scutage had been raised, the\r\nfrequency of its imposition had been increased, the conditions of\r\nforeign service had become more burdensome, and the objects of foreign\r\nexpeditions more unpopular; while attempts were sometimes made to exact\r\nboth service and scutage in the same year. The limit of the barons’\r\nendurance was reached when, on 26th May, 1214, John, already discredited\r\nby his unsuccessful expeditions in Poitou, soon to be followed by the\r\nutter overthrow of his allies at Bouvines, issued writs for a scutage at\r\nthe unheard-of rate of three marks, grounded doubtless on the inquest of\r\n1212 and unusually far-reaching in the subjects which it embraced.[139]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 139:\r\n\r\n  See Miss Norgate, _John Lackland_, 210, and cf. _supra_, p. 37.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThen the final crash came; this writ was like a call to arms—a call not\r\nto follow the King’s banner, but to fight against him.\r\n\r\n                 III. Royal Justice and Feudal Justice.\r\n\r\nA well-known aphorism of legal text-books, couched in language unusually\r\nfigurative, declares the King to be “the sole fountain of justice.”\r\nCorrect as it is to apply this metaphor to the present state of the\r\nconstitution, it would be an anachronism and a blunder to transport it\r\ninto the thirteenth century. In John’s reign there still were—as there\r\nhad been for centuries—not one, but many competing jurisdictions. It was\r\nby no means a foregone conclusion that the King’s Courts were the proper\r\ntribunals to which a wronged individual must repair to seek redress. On\r\nthe contrary, the great bulk of the rural population, the villeins, had\r\nno _locus standi_ except in the court of the manor to which they\r\nbelonged; while the doors of the royal Courts had been closed against\r\nthe ordinary freeman previous to the reign of Henry II. Royal justice\r\nwas still the exception, not the rule. Each man must seek redress, in\r\nthe ordinary case, in his own locality. To dispense justice to the\r\nnation at large was no part of the normal business of a medieval King.\r\n\r\nI. _Rival Systems of Law Courts._ In the thirteenth century, there\r\nexisted not one source of justice, but many. Rival courts, eagerly\r\ncompeting to extend their own sphere of usefulness and to increase their\r\nown fees, existed in a bewildering multitude. Putting aside for the\r\nmoment the Courts Christian, the Borough Courts, the Forest Courts, and\r\nall exceptional or peculiar tribunals, there existed three great rival\r\nsystems of jurisdiction which may be named in the order in which they\r\nbecame in turn prominent in England.\r\n\r\n  (1) _Local or District Courts._ Justice was originally a local\r\nproduct, and administered in rude tribunals, which partook more or less\r\nof a popular character. Each shire had its council or assembly for\r\nhearing pleas, known as a “shire-moot” in Anglo-Saxon days, and usually\r\nas a “_comitatus_” after the Norman Conquest; while each of the smaller\r\ndistricts subdividing the shire, and forming units of administration for\r\npurposes of taxation, defence, justice, and police, had a moot or\r\ncouncil of its own, serving as a court of law, to which the inhabitants\r\nof the various villages brought their pleas in the first instance. These\r\nsmaller districts were known as hundreds in the south, and as wapentakes\r\n(a name of Danish derivation) in the north.\r\n\r\nThe theory generally received is that all freemen were originally\r\nsuitors in the courts of the shire and the hundred, and that the whole\r\nbody of those present, the ordinary peasant (“ceorl”) equally with the\r\nman of noble blood (“eorl”), took an active part in the proceedings,\r\npronouncing (or, at least, concurring in) the judgments or dooms there\r\ndeclared; but that, as time progressed, the majority of the Anglo-Saxon\r\nceorls sank to the half-servile position of villeins—men tied for life\r\nto the soil of the manor, and passing, like property, from father to\r\nson. These villeins, although still subjected to the burden of\r\nattendance, and to some of the other duties of their former free estate,\r\nwere deprived of all those rights which had once formed the counterpart\r\nof the obligations. Another school of historians, it is true, denies\r\nthat the mass of the population, even in very early times, ever enjoyed\r\nthe right to any active share in the dispensation of justice. It is\r\nunnecessary here to attempt a solution of these and many other intricate\r\nproblems surrounding the composition and functions of the courts of\r\nshire and hundred; or to discuss the still more vexed question how far\r\nthe small assembly of the villagers of each township is worthy to be\r\nreckoned a formal court of law. It is sufficient to emphasize the\r\nimportance of the existence from early times of a complete network of\r\ncourts, each dispensing justice for the people of its own district.\r\n\r\n(2) _Feudal Courts._ Centuries before the Norman Conquest, this system\r\nof popular or district justice found itself confronted with a rival\r\nscheme of jurisdictions—the innumerable private courts belonging to the\r\nfeudal lords of the various estates into which the whole of England had\r\nbeen divided. This new system of private tribunals (known indifferently\r\nas feudal courts, manorial courts, seignorial courts, or heritable\r\njurisdictions) slowly but surely, such is the orthodox view generally,\r\nalthough not universally accepted, gained on the older system of popular\r\ncourts of shire, hundred, and wapentake.[140]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 140:\r\n\r\n  This account of the relations of the two sets of courts would receive\r\n  the support of recent writers, such as Maitland and Round, as well as\r\n  of the older generation, such as Stubbs and Freeman. Mr. Frederic\r\n  Seebohm may be mentioned as perhaps the most weighty upholder of the\r\n  opposite view, which regards the manorial courts as of equally early\r\n  or earlier origin than those of hundred and shire.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nPractically every holder of land in England came to be also the holder\r\nof a court for the inhabitants of that land. The double meaning of the\r\nword “_dominus_” illustrates the double position of the man who was thus\r\nboth owner and lord.[141] In the struggle between two schemes of\r\njustice, the tribunals of the feudal magnates easily triumphed, but\r\nnever absolutely abolished their rivals. The earlier popular courts\r\nstill lived on; but the system of district justice which had once\r\nembraced the whole of England was completely honeycombed by the growth\r\nof the feudal courts. As each once-free village passed under the\r\ndomination of a lord, and gradually became a manor or embryo-manor, the\r\nvillage-moot (with such rudimentary authority as it may originally have\r\npossessed) gave way before a new manorial court endowed with much wider\r\npowers and with more effective sanction for enforcing them. Further, as\r\ncomplete hundreds fell under the control of specially powerful magnates,\r\nthe entire courts of these hundreds were replaced by or transformed into\r\nfeudal courts; franchises thus took the place of many of the old popular\r\nmoots. Still, the older system retained possession of part of the\r\ndisputed ground, thanks to the protection given it in its hour of need\r\nby the Crown. A great majority of the hundreds never bowed to the\r\nexclusive domination of any one lord, and the courts of the shires were\r\njealously guarded by the Norman Kings against the encroachment of even\r\nthe most powerful of barons. It is true that they only escaped\r\nsubjection to a local landowner in order to fall under the more powerful\r\ndomination of the Crown. Yet the mere fact that they continued in\r\nexistence acted at least as a check on the growth of the rival system of\r\nseignorial tribunals.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 141:\r\n\r\n  Cf. “landlord.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAlthough it was the policy of the Norman Kings to prevent their barons\r\nfrom gaining excessive powers of jurisdiction, it was by no means their\r\npolicy to oppose these jurisdictions altogether. On the contrary, the\r\nConqueror and his sons were glad that order should be enforced and\r\njustice administered, even in a rough-and-ready manner, in those\r\ndistricts of England whither the Crown’s arm was not long enough to\r\nreach, and where the popular courts were likely to prove inefficient.\r\nThus, the old system and the new existed side by side; it was to the\r\ninterest of the central government to play off the one against the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIn later days (but not till long after Magna Carta) each manorial\r\ntribunal split into three distinct courts, according to the class of\r\npleas it was called upon to try. Later writers distinguish absolutely\r\nfrom each other, the Court Baron, settling civil disputes between the\r\nfreeholders of the manor; the Court Customary, deciding non-criminal\r\ncases among the villeins; and the Court Leet, a petty criminal court\r\nenforcing order and punishing small offences. The powers of these courts\r\nmight vary, and in many districts the jurisdiction over misdemeanours\r\nbelonged not to the steward of the lord of the manor, but to the sheriff\r\nin his half-yearly Circuits or “Tourns” through the county. In the\r\nimperfectly feudalized districts the Tourn of the sheriff, as the\r\nrepresentative of the Crown, performed the same functions as the Court\r\nLeet performed within the territories of a franchise.\r\n\r\n(3) _Royal Courts._ Originally, the King’s Court had been merely one\r\nfeudal court among other feudal courts—differing in degree rather than\r\nin kind from those of the great earls or barons. The King, as a feudal\r\nlord, dispensed justice among his feudal tenants (whether barons and\r\nfreemen or only servile dependents), just as any baron or freeman\r\ndispensed justice among _his_ tenants, bond or free. No one dreamed, in\r\nthe time of the Norman Kings, that the _Curia Regis_ would or could\r\nundertake the enormous labour of dispensing justice for the whole nation\r\n(or even of supervising the courts which did dispense it). Each\r\nindividual must, on the contrary, look for the redress of wrongs either\r\nto the court of the people of his own district, or to the court of his\r\nlord. Royal justice for all (in the modern sense) was simply impossible.\r\nThe monarchy had no machinery at command for effecting this. The task\r\nwas a gigantic one, which no Anglo-Saxon King, which not even William\r\nI., could possibly have undertaken. No attempt in this direction was\r\nmade by the Crown until the reign of Henry II., who was placed in a\r\nposition of unprecedented power, partly by circumstances, but chiefly by\r\nhis great abilities. Even he, born reformer as he was, would never have\r\nincreased so greatly the labours of government, if he had not clearly\r\nseen how enormously the change would enhance both the security of his\r\nthrone and the revenue of his exchequer.\r\n\r\nIn normal circumstances, then, prior to the Angevin period, the King’s\r\nCourt was merely a tribunal for transacting the king’s own business, or\r\nfor holding pleas between the Crown’s own immediate tenants. Even from\r\nan early date, however, the business of the monarch, from the mere fact\r\nthat he was lord paramount, was necessarily wider than the business of\r\nany mesne lord. In a dim way, too, it must have been apparent from the\r\nfirst, that offences against the established order were offences also\r\nagainst the king, and that, therefore, to redress these was the king’s\r\nbusiness competent in the King’s Courts. Further, the Sovereign’s\r\nprerogative quickly waxed strong, and enabled him to give effect to his\r\nwishes in this as in other matters. The Crown asserted a right (while\r\nadmitting no corresponding duty) to investigate any pleas of special\r\nimportance, whether civil or criminal. Still, up to the Norman Conquest,\r\nand thereafter under William and his sons, royal justice had made no\r\ndeliberate attempt to become national justice, or to supersede feudal\r\njustice. Each kept to its recognized province. The struggle between the\r\ntwo began only with the reforms of Henry II.[142]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 142:\r\n\r\n  The various stages in the gradual process, extending from the reign of\r\n  Henry I. to that of Edward I., by which royal justice insidiously\r\n  encroached on feudal justice, may be studied in Professor Maitland’s\r\n  admirably lucid account prefaced to _Sel. Pleas in Manorial Courts_,\r\n  pp. liii. seq. See also Pollock and Maitland, I. 181-2.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThus the three great systems of jurisdiction, popular justice, feudal\r\njustice, and royal justice (each depending on a different principle)\r\nsucceeded each other, on the whole, in the order in which they are here\r\nnamed. Yet the sequence is in some ways logical rather than\r\nchronological. No absolute line can be drawn, showing where the\r\nsupremacy of one principle ended and that of the next began. For\r\ncenturies, all three co-existed, and struggled for the mastery. The\r\ngerms of manorial jurisdiction may have been present from an early date.\r\nShire-courts and hundred courts alike were continually in danger of\r\nfalling under the domination of powerful local magnates. Yet the\r\nshire-courts were successful in maintaining till the last (thanks to\r\nroyal favour) their independence of the manorial jurisdictions and their\r\nlords; while only a proportion of the hundred courts fell into bondage.\r\n\r\nThe royal courts, again, exercised an important jurisdiction from the\r\nvery foundation of the monarchy; and the king in person, or by deputy,\r\nfrom an early date, withdrew special causes from the County Courts, and\r\nalso interfered with manorial franchises. Finally, the Courts Baron were\r\nnever abolished, but only silently undermined by the policy of Henry II.\r\nand his successors, until they gradually sank into decrepitude without\r\nreally ceasing to exist.\r\n\r\nWith these caveats, however, the three systems may be regarded, in some\r\nmeasure, as following one another in the order named:—popular justice,\r\nfeudal justice, royal justice.\r\n\r\nII. _Legal Procedure._ The procedure adopted in litigation in\r\nAnglo-Saxon and Norman times was similar in essentials in all three\r\nclasses of tribunals, and differed materially from the practice of\r\ncourts of law at the present day. Some knowledge of the more glaring\r\ncontrasts between ancient and modern procedure may here be profitably\r\ndiscussed, not only on account of the interest inherent in the subject,\r\nbut also because it will conduce to an understanding of several\r\notherwise obscure provisions of Magna Carta.\r\n\r\nAvoiding technical language, and eliminating special procedure peculiar\r\nto any one court or country, the principal stages in a normal litigation\r\nin a modern court of law may be given briefly as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) On the complaint of the party aggrieved—the plaintiff—a summons, or\r\nwrit, is issued by an officer of the court. Proceedings are opened by\r\nthe command addressed to the defendant to appear in court and answer\r\nwhat is alleged against him.\r\n\r\n(2) Each party lodges written statements of his facts and pleas—that is,\r\nof the circumstances of the case as they appear to him (or such of them\r\nas he hopes to bring evidence to prove)—on which he founds his claim or\r\nhis defence, and of the legal principles he intends to deduce from these\r\ncircumstances. When these statements of facts and pleas have been\r\nrevised and adjusted, the complete data are now before the court; each\r\nparty has finally stated what he considers essential to his case.\r\n\r\n(3) Proof is, in due course, led; that is, each party is afforded an\r\nopportunity of proving such facts as he has alleged (and as require\r\nproof through the denial of his opponent). This he may do by documents,\r\nwitnesses, or otherwise. Each party has the further privilege of shaking\r\nhis opponent’s evidence by cross-examination.\r\n\r\n(4) The next important stage is the debate, the main object of which is\r\nto establish by legal arguments the pleas founded on; to deduce the\r\nlegal consequences inherent in the facts which have been proved.\r\n\r\n(5) Finally, the judge gives his decision. He has to determine, after\r\nweighing the evidence led by either party, what facts have really been\r\nestablished, and how far the various pleas of plaintiff and defendant\r\nrespectively are implied in these facts. A considerable amount of\r\nthought and reasoning of such a kind as can be successfully performed\r\nonly by a highly trained legal mind is thus necessary before the final\r\ndecree or sentence can be pronounced by a judge in a modern court of\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nA trial in Anglo-Saxon and early Norman times stands in notable contrast\r\nto all this in almost every essential of its stages and procedure, and\r\neven more radically in the spirit which pervades the whole. Thus, the\r\nproceedings, from first to last, were purely oral, there being no\r\noriginal writ or summons, no written pleadings, and no record kept of\r\nthe decision except in the memories of those present. The functions of\r\n“the judges” were entirely different, and demanded no previous\r\nprofessional or legal training, since they were not required either to\r\nweigh a mass of evidence or to determine the bearing of subtle legal\r\narguments, but merely to see fairplay, and to decide, according to\r\nsimple rules, well established by centuries of custom, by what test the\r\nallegations of plaintiff and defendant were respectively to stand or\r\nfall. Finally, the arrangement of the stages of the litigation was\r\nentirely different. It is with something of a shock that the modern\r\nlawyer learns that in civil and criminal causes alike “judgment”\r\ninvariably preceded “trial.” Reflection will soon convince him that each\r\nof these words had in the Middle Ages a meaning different from what it\r\nbears to-day. These ancient meanings can be best understood by following\r\nthe stages of the old procedure.\r\n\r\n(1) The initial difficulty was to obtain the presence of the defendant\r\nin court, since there existed a strange reluctance either to compel his\r\nattendance or to allow judgment to pass against him by default. No\r\ninitial writ was issued commanding him to appear; almost endless delays\r\nwere allowed.\r\n\r\n(2) When both parties had been, after many adjournments, actually\r\nbrought face to face before the court, the statements alike of the claim\r\nand of the defence were made verbally and in set _formulae_, the\r\nslightest slip or stumble in the words of which involved complete\r\nfailure. This is merely one illustration of the tremendously formal and\r\ntechnical nature of early legal procedure common to all half-developed\r\nsystems of jurisprudence.\r\n\r\n(3) Before the plaintiff could put the defendant finally on his defence,\r\nhe required to show some preliminary presumption of the probability or\r\n_bona fides_ of his case. This he usually did by producing two friends\r\nready to substantiate his claim, known sometimes as his “suit” (Latin\r\n_secta_), or his “fore-witnesses.” Their evidence was not weighed\r\nagainst the “proof” afterwards led by the defendant; its object was\r\nmerely to warrant the Court in demanding “proof” from the latter at\r\nall.[143]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 143:\r\n\r\n  Sometimes no fore-witnesses were required; for example, to choose an\r\n  obvious case, where the claim was for the restoration of stolen\r\n  cattle, which had been traced by “hue and cry” to defendant’s house or\r\n  byre. The presumption of guilt was here so strong as to render\r\n  corroborative evidence unnecessary. The plaintiff’s unsupported oath\r\n  was thus sufficient to put the defendant on his “trial.” On the other\r\n  hand, in the absence alike of presumption and of witnesses swearing in\r\n  support of plaintiff’s oath, the defendant escaped without any “trial”\r\n  at all.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(4) Then came the judgment—the chief or “medial” judgment, so called to\r\ndistinguish it from the less important final judgment or decree which\r\ncame at a later stage. This medial judgment or “doom,” to use the\r\nAnglo-Saxon word, partook in no respect of the nature of the judgment of\r\na modern tribunal. It came _before_ the proof or trial, not after it. It\r\nconsisted indeed in decreeing whether or no, on the strength of the\r\nprevious procedure, the defendant should be put to his proof at all; and\r\nif so, _what_ “proof” should be demanded.\r\n\r\nNow, the exact test to be appointed by the court varied somewhat,\r\naccording to circumstances, but long-established custom had laid down\r\nwith some exactitude a rule applicable to every case likely to occur;\r\nand, further, the possible modes of proof were limited to some four or\r\nfive at the outside. In Anglo-Saxon times, these were mainly\r\ncompurgation, ordeal, witnesses (whose functions were, however, widely\r\ndifferent from those of witnesses in modern law), and charters. The\r\nNorman Conquest introduced for the new-comers, a form of proof\r\npreviously unknown in England—\"trial by combat\"—which tended, for the\r\nupper classes at least, to supersede all earlier methods of procedure.\r\nThe “proof,” of whatever kind it might be, thus appointed by the\r\n“judges” for the defendant’s performance was technically known as a\r\n“law” (Latin _lex_) in the sense of a “test” or “trial” or “task,”\r\naccording to his success or failure in which his case should stand or\r\nfall.[144]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 144:\r\n\r\n  See _infra_ under chapters 38 and 39, where the meaning of _lex_ is\r\n  discussed.\r\n\r\nIt will be apparent that to pronounce a “judgment” in this sense was a\r\nsimple affair, a mere formality in the ordinary case, where room for\r\ndubiety could hardly be admitted; and thus it was possible for\r\n“judgment” to be delivered by all the members of a feudal court, or even\r\nby all the suitors present at a meeting of the hundred or shire-moot.\r\n\r\n(5) The crucial stage, this “trial” which thus came after “judgment,”\r\nconsisted in one party (usually the defendant) essaying, on the day\r\nappointed, to satisfy the court as to the truth of his allegations by\r\nperforming the task or “law” which had been set or “doomed” to him. When\r\nthis consisted in the production of a charter, or of “transaction\r\nwitnesses” (that is, the testimony of those officials appointed in each\r\nmarket-town to certify the conclusion of such bargains as the sale of\r\ncattle), it commends itself readily to the modern understanding and\r\napproval. More frequently, however, it took the form of “an oath with\r\noath-helpers,” the plaintiff bringing with him eleven or twelve of his\r\ntrusty friends or dependents to swear after him the words of a long and\r\ncumbrous oath, under the risk of being punished as perjurers for any\r\nslip in the formula. This was known also as compurgation. Sometimes the\r\ndecision was referred to the intervention of Providence by appealing to\r\nthe ordeal of the red-hot iron or the more-dreaded ordeal of water.\r\nAfter the Norman Conquest, the trial in all litigations between men of\r\nhigh rank, took the form of _duellum_ or legally regulated combat\r\nbetween the parties. The defendant gained his case if he caused the\r\nplaintiff to own himself worsted by uttering the word “craven.” He\r\ngained his case equally if he only held out till nightfall (when the\r\ncombat terminated) against the plaintiff’s attempts to force him to\r\nutter that fateful word.[145]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 145:\r\n\r\n  Details may be studied in Dr. George Neilson’s _Trial by Combat_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe battle was fought out before the “judges,” who, in the case of an\r\nearl or baron, were the other earls and barons assembled as his peers in\r\nthe King’s court; and, in the case of the tenant of a mesne lord, were\r\nthe other freeholders of the same manor.\r\n\r\nThe ancient “trial” (the importance of which is increased by the fact\r\nthat it continued long after 1215, and may be traced in several clauses\r\nof Magna Carta)[146] was thus something entirely different from the\r\nmodern “trial.” It may be said without exaggeration that there was no\r\n“trial” at all in the current meaning of the word—no balancing of the\r\ntestimony of one set of witnesses against another, no open proof and\r\ncross-examination, no debate on the legal principles involved. The\r\nancient “trial” was merely a formal test, which was, except in the case\r\nof battle, entirely one-sided. The phrase “burden of proof” was\r\ninapplicable. The litigant to whom “a law” was appointed had the\r\n“privilege of proof” rather than the “burden of proof,” and he usually\r\nwon his case—especially in compurgation, and even in ordeal if he had\r\narranged matters properly with the priest who presided.[147]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 146:\r\n\r\n  See _infra_, chapters 38 and 39.\r\n\r\nFootnote 147:\r\n\r\n  Ordeal and compurgation and other forms of _lex_ are further discussed\r\n  _infra_, under chapters 38 and 39.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(6) The whole was concluded by the final “judgment,” or decree, which\r\npractically took the form of a sentence passed on the vanquished. The\r\njudges could scarcely be said to decide the case, since this had already\r\nbeen practically decided by the success or failure of the party on whom\r\nthe proof had been laid. Those who gave sentence were “judges” merely in\r\nthe sense of umpires who saw fairplay to both players, according to the\r\nacknowledged rules of the desperate game.[148]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 148:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Thayer, _Evidence_, p. 8. “The conception of the trial was that of\r\n  a proceeding between the parties, carried on publicly, under forms\r\n  which the community oversaw.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn one sense, the final (as opposed to the medial) “judgment” was\r\ndetermined by the parties themselves, or by one of them; in another and\r\nhigher sense the facts at issue were left to Providence; a miracle, if\r\nnecessary, would attest the just claim of the innocent man. Those who\r\ndelivered the final doom, had a purely formal task to perform, and had\r\nlittle in common with the “judges” of a modern court.[149]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 149:\r\n\r\n  These stages of procedure are all fully illustrated by the actual\r\n  words of recorded cases of the thirteenth century. Two of these, both\r\n  from the reign of John, one decided by battle, the other by ordeal,\r\n  may here be cited. (1) \"Hereward, the son of William, appeals Walter,\r\n  the son of Hugh, of assaulting him, in the King’s peace, and wounding\r\n  him in the arm with an iron fork, and giving him another wound on the\r\n  head; and this he offers to prove on his body as the Court shall\r\n  appoint. And Walter defends all of it by his body. And it is testified\r\n  by the coroners and by the whole county that the same Hereward showed\r\n  his wounds at the proper time, and has made sufficient suit. Therefore\r\n  it is decreed that there should be “battle.”... Let them come armed, a\r\n  fortnight from St. Swithin’s day, at Leicester.\" _Sel. Pleas of Crown_\r\n  (Selden Society), p. 18. (2) “Walter Trenchebof was said to have\r\n  handed to Inger of Faldingthorpe the knife with which he killed Guy\r\n  Foliot, and is suspected of it. Let him purge himself by water that he\r\n  did not consent to it. He has failed and is hanged.” _Ibid._, p. 75.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe essentials of this procedure were the same in the Norman as in the\r\nAnglo-Saxon period, and that in all three classes of tribunals—popular\r\ncourts, manorial courts, and royal courts.\r\n\r\nTwo innovations the Norman Kings did make; they introduced trial by\r\ncombat (already sufficiently discussed), and likewise the continental\r\nmethod of obtaining information on sworn testimony. Among the\r\nprerogatives of the Norman Dukes one of the most valuable was the right\r\nto compel the sworn evidence of reliable men of any district—men\r\nspecially picked for the purpose, and put on oath before answering the\r\nquestions asked of them, thus endangering their eternal welfare in the\r\nevent of falsehood, and laying themselves open to temporal penalties for\r\nperjury.\r\n\r\nThis procedure was known as _inquisitio_ (or the seeking of information)\r\nwhen regarded from the point of view of the government making the\r\ninquiry, and as _recognitio_ (or the giving of information) from the\r\npoint of view of those supplying it. This extremely simple and practical\r\ndevice was flexible and capable of extension to endless new uses in the\r\ndeft hands of the Norman Kings in England. William the Conqueror\r\nemployed it in collecting the laws and customs of the conquered people,\r\nand, later on, in compiling Domesday Book; while his successors made it\r\nthe instrument of various experiments in the science of taxation. It has\r\na double claim to the interest of the constitutional historian, because\r\nit was one of the influences which helped to mould our Parliamentary\r\ninstitutions; and because several of the new uses to which it came to be\r\nput had a close connection with the origin of trial by jury. The\r\nrecognitors, indeed, were simply local jurors in a rude or elementary\r\nform.[150]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 150:\r\n\r\n  The relation of “recognition” to trial by jury is fully discussed,\r\n  _infra_, Part III., section 7.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIII. _Reforms of Henry II. in Law Courts and Legal Procedure._ It was\r\nreserved for Henry of Anjou to inaugurate an entirely new era in the\r\nrelations of the three classes of courts. He was the first king\r\ndeliberately to plan the overthrow of the feudal jurisdictions by\r\ninsidiously undermining them, if not yet by open attack. He was the\r\nfirst king to reduce the old district courts so thoroughly under the\r\ncontrol of royal officials as to turn them practically into royal\r\ncourts. He was the first king also to throw open the doors of his own\r\ncourts of law to all-comers, to all freemen, that is to say, for the\r\ndespised villein had for centuries still to seek redress in the court of\r\nthat very lord of the manor who was too often his oppressor.\r\n\r\nIn brief, then, Henry’s policy was twofold: to convert the County Courts\r\npractically into Royal Courts, since in them royal officials now\r\ndispensed royal justice according to the same rules as prevailed at the\r\nKing’s own _Curia_; and to reduce all manorial or private courts to\r\ninsignificance by diverting pleas to his own _Curia_, and leaving the\r\nrival tribunals to die gradually from inanition. Both branches of this\r\npolicy met ultimately with complete success, although the event hung in\r\nthe balance until long after his death. The barons, though partially\r\ndeceived by the gradual and insidious nature of Henry’s reforms, did\r\nwhat they could to thwart him; but the current of events was against\r\nthem and with the Crown. Royal justice steadily encroached upon feudal\r\njustice. One of the last stands made by the barons has left its traces\r\nplainly written in several chapters of Magna Carta.[151]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 151:\r\n\r\n  _E.g._ 34 and 39.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThese contain what seem, at first sight, to be merely trivial\r\nalterations of technical points of court procedure; but inextricably\r\nbound up with them are principles of wide political and constitutional\r\nimportance. Henry’s policy was to disguise radical reforms until they\r\nlooked like small changes of procedure; it follows that the framers of\r\nMagna Carta, while appearing merely to seek the reversal of these\r\ntrivial points, were really seeking to return to the totally different\r\nconditions which had prevailed prior to the reforms of Henry.\r\n\r\nA short account of the main outlines of that monarch’s new system of\r\nprocedure forms a necessary preliminary to a complete comprehension of\r\nthese important chapters of Magna Carta. Such an account falls naturally\r\ninto two divisions.\r\n\r\n(1) _Criminal Justice._ (_a_) By his Assizes of Clarendon and\r\nNorthampton Henry strictly reserved all important crimes for the\r\nexclusive consideration of his own judges either on circuit or at his\r\ncourt; and he demanded entry for these judges into franchises, however\r\npowerful, for that purpose. In this part of his policy, the King was\r\ncompletely successful; heinous crimes were, in the beginning of the\r\nthirteenth century, admitted on all hands to be “pleas of the Crown”\r\n(that is, cases exclusively reserved for the royal jurisdiction); and\r\nMagna Carta made no attempt to reverse this part of the Crown’s policy.\r\nThe change was accepted as inevitable. All that was attempted in 1215\r\nwas to obtain a promise that these functions, now surrendered to the\r\nCrown forever, should be discharged by the Crown’s officials in a proper\r\nmanner.[152]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 152:\r\n\r\n  See _infra_, under chapters 24 and 45.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(_b_) Henry’s usual good sense, in this matter stimulated by some\r\nnotable miscarriages of justice, led him to question the equity of the\r\nprocedure usually adopted in criminal pleas, namely, by “appeal” or\r\nformal accusation by the injured party, or his nearest surviving\r\nrelative. He substituted, whenever possible, communal accusation for\r\nindividual accusation; that is, the duty of proclaiming (or indicting)\r\nthe suspected criminals of each district before the King’s Justices was\r\nno longer left to private initiative, but was laid on a body of\r\nneighbours specially selected for that purpose—the predecessors of the\r\nGrand Jury of later days. This new procedure, it is true, supplemented\r\nrather than superseded the older procedure; yet it marked a distinct\r\nadvance. Appeals were discouraged and exact rules laid down restricting\r\nthe right of accusation to certain cases and individuals.[153]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 153:\r\n\r\n  See _infra_, under chapter 54.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(_c_) A necessary complement of the discouragement of appeals was the\r\ndiscouragement of “trial by combat” also, since that formed the natural\r\nsequel. An ingenious device was invented and gradually extended to an\r\nincreasing number of cases; an accused individual might apply for a writ\r\nknown as _de odio et atia_, and thus avoid the _duellum_ altogether by\r\nhaving his guilt or innocence determined by what was practically a jury\r\nof neighbours.[154]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 154:\r\n\r\n  See _infra_, under chapter 36.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(2) _Civil Justice._ Henry’s innovations under this head were equally\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n(_a_) An unflinching rule was established that no case could be brought\r\nbefore the royal court until a writ had been obtained from chancery.\r\nThis had to be paid for, sometimes at a fixed rate, and sometimes at\r\nwhatever sum the Crown demanded. The whole procedure in the royal\r\ncourts, which followed the issuing of such a writ, came to be known as\r\n“the writ process.” Once it was issued, all proceedings in other courts\r\nmust stop. One special form of writ (known as _praecipe_), in\r\nparticular, became a royal instrument for removing before the King’s own\r\n_Curia_ cases pending in the manorial courts of mesne lords. To do this\r\nwas to enrich the King at the expense of some baron or other freeman, by\r\nbringing to the Exchequer fees which otherwise would be paid to the\r\nowner of the private court. This was plainly \"to cause a freeman to lose\r\nhis court\"—an abuse specially struck at by chapter 34 of the Great\r\nCharter.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The mass of new business attracted to the King’s Courts made it\r\nnecessary to increase, the staff of judges and to distribute the work\r\namong them. A natural division was that ordinary pleas (or common pleas)\r\nshould be tried before one set of judges, and royal pleas (or pleas of\r\nthe Crown) before another. This distinction is recognized in many\r\nseparate chapters.[155] Thus two groups of judges were formed, each of\r\nwhich was at first rather a committee of the larger _Curia_ as a whole\r\nthan an independent tribunal; but, in later years, the two rapidly\r\ndeveloped into entirely separate courts—the Court of Common Pleas (at\r\nfirst known as the Bench, that is, the ordinary Bench), and the Court of\r\nKing’s Bench (that is, the royal Bench, known also at first as the court\r\n_Coram Rege_, since it was always supposed to be held in the King’s\r\npresence).\r\n\r\nFootnote 155:\r\n\r\n  See _infra_, under chapters 17 and 24.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(_c_) Special procedure for determining pleas of disputed titles to land\r\nor rights of possession was also invented by Henry to take the place of\r\nthe ancient method of trial by battle. These Assizes, as they were\r\ncalled, are fully discussed elsewhere.[156] The Grand Assize was looked\r\non with suspicion by the barons as a procedure competent only before the\r\nroyal courts, and therefore closely bound up with the King’s other\r\ndevices for substituting his own jurisdiction for that of the private\r\ncourts. The petty assizes, on the contrary, met with a ready acceptance,\r\nand the barons in 1215, far from objecting to their continuance,\r\ndemanded that they should be held in regular sessions four times a year\r\nin each county of England.\r\n\r\nFootnote 156:\r\n\r\n  See _infra_, under chapter 18.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThese were the chief innovations which enabled Henry, while instituting\r\nmany reforms urgently required and gladly welcomed by the mass of his\r\nsubjects, at the same time to effect a revolution in the relations of\r\nroyal justice to feudal justice. As time went on, new royal writs and\r\nremedies were being continually devised to meet new types of cases; and\r\nlitigants flocked more and more readily to the King’s Courts, leaving\r\nthe seignorial courts empty of business and of fees. Nor was this the\r\nonly grievance of the barons. When one of their own number was amerced\r\nor accused of any offence involving loss of liberty or lands, he might\r\nbe compelled by the Crown, under Henry and his sons, to submit to have\r\nthe amercement assessed or the criminal proceedings conducted by one of\r\nthe new Benches (by a tribunal composed of some four or five of the\r\nKing’s officials), in place of the time-honoured judgment of his peers\r\nassembled in the _Commune Concilium_ (the predecessor of the modern\r\nParliament).\r\n\r\nCan we wonder that the barons objected to be amerced and judged by their\r\ninferiors?[157] Can we wonder that they resented the complete though\r\ngradual supersession of their own profitable jurisdictions by the royal\r\ncourts?[158] or that they looked with suspicion on every new legal\r\ndevelopment of the royal justice? Can we wonder that, when they seemed\r\nto have King John for the moment in their power, they demanded redress\r\nof this group of grievances, as well as of those connected with\r\narbitrary increase of feudal burdens?\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 157:\r\n\r\n  See _infra_, under chapters 21 and 39.\r\n\r\nFootnote 158:\r\n\r\n  See _infra_, under chapter 34.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe cause for wonder rather is that their demands in this respect were\r\nnot more sweeping and more drastic. It was one thing for their fathers\r\nto have endured the encroachments of so strong a King as Henry II.—far\r\ntoo wise a statesman to show clearly whither his innovations were\r\nultimately tending, and (some lapses notwithstanding) a just ruler on\r\nthe whole, using his increased prerogatives with moderation and for\r\nnational ends. It was quite another thing to endure the same\r\nencroachments (or worse) from an unpopular King like John, discredited\r\nand in their power, who had neither disguised his arrogance nor made\r\ngood use of his prerogatives. Royal justice, as dispensed by John, was\r\nin every way inferior to royal justice as dispensed under his father’s\r\nvigilant eye. Yet the exasperated barons, in the hour of their triumph,\r\nactually accepted, and accepted cordially, one half of royal justice;\r\nwhile they sought to abolish only the other half. The chapters bearing\r\non the question of jurisdiction may thus be arranged in two groups, some\r\nreactionary, and some favourable to Henry’s reforms. On the one hand, no\r\nlord of a manor shall be robbed of his court by the King evoking before\r\nthe royal courts pleas between two freeholders of the lord’s manor;[159]\r\nno freeman shall be judged or condemned by the King’s officials, but\r\nonly before the full body of his peers (that is, of his fellow earls and\r\nbarons, if he be an earl or baron, and of his fellow tenants of the\r\nmanor, if he holds of a mesne lord);[160] earls and barons must be\r\namerced only by their equals.[161] On the other hand, in prescribing\r\nremedies for various abuses connected with numerous branches of legal\r\nprocedure recently introduced into the royal courts, the barons accepted\r\nby implication this new procedure itself and the royal encroachments\r\nimplied therein. For example, the Crown’s right to hold “Common Pleas”\r\nwas impliedly admitted, when the barons asked and obtained a promise\r\nthat these should be tried in some certain place (that is, at\r\nWestminster).[162] Yet these very pleas, ordinary ones in which the\r\nCrown had no special interest, as opposed to Pleas of the Crown in which\r\nit had, must have included many cases which, prior to Henry II.’s\r\nreforms, would not have been tried in a royal court. Again, in\r\nregulating the various Petty Assizes, chapters 18 and 19 admit the\r\nCrown’s right to hold them. Such Assizes must be taken henceforth four\r\ntimes a year. Here, as in chapter 40, the ground of complaint is not\r\nthat there is too much of royal justice, but rather that there is too\r\nlittle of it; it is henceforth to be neither delayed nor denied.\r\nFurther, the encroachments made by Henry II. in 1166 on the rights of\r\nprivate franchises in the matter of criminal jurisdiction are\r\nhomologated by acquiescence in the King’s definition of “Pleas of the\r\nCrown” implied in chapter 24.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 159:\r\n\r\n  c. 34\r\n\r\nFootnote 160:\r\n\r\n  c. 39.\r\n\r\nFootnote 161:\r\n\r\n  c. 21.\r\n\r\nFootnote 162:\r\n\r\n  c. 17.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the two clearly contrasted groups into which the\r\ninnovations made by Henry and his sons, within the province of justice,\r\nnaturally fell as viewed by John’s opponents in 1215: some of them had\r\nnow come to be warmly welcomed, and these, it was insisted, must be\r\ncontinued by the Crown; while some of them still excited as bitter\r\nopposition as ever, and these, it was insisted, must be utterly swept\r\naway.\r\n\r\n                               PART III.\r\n                  MAGNA CARTA: ITS FORM AND CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n                  I. Its Prototypes: Earlier Charters.\r\n\r\nHowever wide and scattered were the sources from which the substance of\r\nthe Great Charter was derived, its descent, on its formal side, can\r\nreadily be traced, through an unbroken line of antecedents, back to a\r\nvery early date. Magna Carta is directly descended from the Charter of\r\nLiberties of Henry I., and that, again, was a written supplement to the\r\nvows taken by that monarch at his coronation, couched in similar terms\r\nto those invariably sworn at their anointing by the Anglo-Saxon kings of\r\nEngland, from Edgar to Edward Confessor.\r\n\r\nThe ties which thus connect King John’s promises of good government with\r\nthe promises to the same effect made at their coronation by the princes\r\nof the old dynasty of Wessex are by no means of an accidental nature.\r\nNot only is identity of substance, in part at least, maintained\r\nthroughout; but the promises were the outcome of an essential feature of\r\nthe old English constitution—a feature so deeply rooted that it survived\r\nthe shock of the Norman Conquest. This feature, so fundamental and so\r\nproductive of great issues, was the elective or quasi-elective nature of\r\nthe monarchy. During the Anglo-Saxon era, two rival principles, the\r\nelective and the hereditary, struggled for the mastery in determining\r\nthe succession to the Crown. In an unsettled state of society, nations\r\ncannot allow the sceptre to pass into the hands of an infant or a\r\nweakling. When a king died, leaving a son of tender age, and survived by\r\na brother of acknowledged ability and mature powers, it was only natural\r\nthat the latter should, in the interests of peace and order, be\r\npreferred to the throne. In such cases, the strict principle of\r\nprimogeniture was not followed. The magnates of the kingdom, the\r\nso-called Witan, claimed the right to choose a fitting successor; yet in\r\nso doing they usually paid as great regard to the claims of kindred as\r\ncircumstances permitted. The exact relations between the elective and\r\nthe hereditary principles were never laid down with absolute precision.\r\nIndeed, the want of definition in all constitutional questions was\r\ncharacteristic of the age—a truth not sufficiently apprehended by\r\nwriters of the school of Kemble and Freeman. The practice usually\r\nfollowed by the Witenagemot was to select as the new ruler some kinsman\r\nof the late king standing in close relationship to him, and at the same\r\ntime competent for the high post. The king-elect thus appointed had,\r\nbefore his title was complete, to undergo a further ceremony: he\r\nrequired to be solemnly anointed by the representative of the spiritual\r\npower, and this gave to the Church an important share in deciding who\r\nshould be king. At an early date—exactly how early is not known, but\r\ncertainly not later than the days of Edgar—it became the invariable\r\npractice for the officiating archbishop to exact an oath of good\r\ngovernment from the king-elect before his final coronation. The precise\r\nterms of this oath became stereotyped; and, as administered by Dunstan\r\nto King Ethelred, they are still extant.[163]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 163:\r\n\r\n  The words have come down to us in two versions: one Anglo-Saxon and\r\n  the other Latin. The former is preserved in _Memorials of St. Dunstan_\r\n  (Rolls Series), p. 355, where it is translated by Dr. Stubbs:—\r\n\r\n  \"In the name of the Holy Trinity I promise three things to the\r\n  Christian people and my subjects: first, that God’s church and all\r\n  Christian people of my dominions hold true peace; the second is that I\r\n  forbid robbery and all unrighteous things to all orders; and third,\r\n  that I promise and enjoin in all dooms, justice and mercy, that the\r\n  gracious and merciful God of his everlasting mercy may forgive us all,\r\n  who liveth and reigneth.\" The name of the King is not mentioned, and\r\n  may have been either Edward or Ethelred, but is usually identified\r\n  with the latter. See Kemble, _Saxons in England_, II. 35.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt may be briefly analyzed into three promises—peace to God’s Church and\r\npeople; repression of violence in men of every rank; justice and mercy\r\nin all judgments. Such was the famous tripartite oath taken, after\r\ncelebration of mass, over the most sacred relics laid on the high altar,\r\nin presence of Church and people, by the kings of the old Anglo-Saxon\r\nrace. When William I., anxious in all things to fortify the legality of\r\nhis title, took the oath in this solemn form, he created a precedent of\r\ntremendous importance, although he may have regarded it at the moment as\r\nan empty formality.[164]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 164:\r\n\r\n  Two independent authorities, both writing from the English point of\r\n  view, Florence of Worcester, and the author of the Worcester version\r\n  of the _Chronicle_, agree that the Conqueror took the oath; the Norman\r\n  authorities neither contradict nor confirm this. “William of Poitiers\r\n  and Guy are silent about the oath.” Freeman, _Norman Conquest_, III.\r\n  561, note.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis step was doubly important: as a link with the past, as a precedent\r\nfor the future. A bridge was thus thrown across the social and political\r\ngulf of the Norman Conquest, preserving the continuity of the monarchy\r\nand of the basis on which it was founded. The elective character of the\r\nkingship, the need for coronation by the Church, and (the natural\r\nsupplement of both) this tripartite oath containing promises of good\r\ngovernment, valuable though vague, were all preserved.\r\n\r\nThis was of vital moment, because limits were thereby placed, in theory\r\nat least, on prerogatives that threatened in practice to become\r\nabsolute. Undoubtedly the power of the Norman kings was very great, and\r\nmight almost be described as irresponsible despotism, tempered by the\r\nfear of rebellion. Three forces indeed acted as curbs: the practical\r\nnecessity for consulting the Curia Regis (or assembly of crown vassals)\r\nbefore any vital step was taken; the restraining influence of the\r\nnational Church, backed by the spiritual powers of Rome; and the growth,\r\nin a vague form, it is true, of a body of public opinion confined as yet\r\nto the upper classes.\r\n\r\nAll these elements counted for something, but failed to restrain\r\nsufficiently even an average king; while they were powerless against a\r\nstrong ruler like William I. The only moment at which the Crown might be\r\ntaken at a clear disadvantage was during the interregnum which followed\r\nthe death of the last occupant of the throne. Two or more rival heirs\r\nmight aspire to the high position, and would be eager to make promises\r\nin return for support. Thus, William Rufus, at his father’s death,\r\nanxious to prevent his elder brother, Duke Robert, from making good his\r\nclaim to the English throne, succeeded chiefly through the friendship of\r\nLanfranc. To gain this, he was compelled to make promises of good\r\ngovernment, and to follow his father’s precedent by taking the oath in\r\nthe ancient form, in which it had been administered by Dunstan to\r\nEthelred. In the same reign began the practice of supplementing verbal\r\npromises by sealed charters, which in some respects must be regarded\r\nsimply as the old coronation oath confirmed, expanded, and reduced to\r\nwriting. No such charter was indeed issued either by Rufus or by his\r\nfather when they were crowned; but the younger William, at a critical\r\nperiod later in his reign, seems to have granted a short Charter of\r\nLiberties, the exact contents of which have not come down to us. At the\r\ndeath of Rufus, his younger brother, Henry I., found himself hard\r\npressed in the competition for the English Crown by Duke Robert (the\r\nConqueror’s eldest son). By a treaty made at Caen in 1091, Duke Robert\r\nand Rufus had agreed that each should constitute the other his heir.\r\nThus Henry was, in a sense, a usurper, and this circumstance made it\r\nnecessary for him to bid high for influential support.[165] It is to\r\nthis doubtful title, coupled with the knowledge of widespread\r\ndisaffection, that Englishmen owe the origin of the first Charter of\r\nLiberties that has come down to us.[166]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 165:\r\n\r\n  Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, I. 328-9, and authorities there cited.\r\n\r\nFootnote 166:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis charter was the price paid by Henry for the support he required in\r\nhis candidature for the Crown. In granting it he admitted, in a sense,\r\nthe contractual basis of his kingship. In discussing its tone and\r\ngeneral tenor there is ample room for differences of opinion. Dr.\r\nStubbs[167] maintains that Henry thereby “definitely commits himself to\r\nthe duties of a national King.” Writers of almost equal authority\r\nsomewhat modify this view, holding that, although circumstances forced\r\nHenry to pose as the leader of the entire nation, yet nothing of this\r\ncould be traced in the charter, the basis of which seems to have been\r\nfeudal rather than national.[168]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 167:\r\n\r\n  _Const. Hist._, I. 331.\r\n\r\nFootnote 168:\r\n\r\n  See Prothero, _Simon de Montfort_, 16: “That charter had been mainly\r\n  of a feudal character; it contained no provision for, and scarcely\r\n  even hinted at, a constitutional form of government.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis view is strengthened by analysis of the actual provisions of the\r\ncharter. While important and definite concessions were made to the\r\nChurch and to the Crown-tenants, those to the people at large were few\r\nand vague—so vague as to be of little practical use. The Church, it was\r\ndeclared, “should be free,” a wide phrase to which these particulars\r\nwere added, namely, that the wardship of sees during vacancies should\r\nnot be sold or hired out, and that no sums should be demanded in name of\r\nreliefs from the lands or tenants of a see when a death occurred. The\r\n“baronage” (to use a convenient anachronism for “the Crown-tenants\r\nconsidered collectively”) received redress of their worst grievances in\r\nregard to reliefs and other feudal obligations. In this respect Henry’s\r\ncharter anticipated and even went beyond some of the reforms of\r\n1215.[169]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 169:\r\n\r\n  Details are reserved for consideration under the feudal clauses of the\r\n  Great Charter.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt is true that the mass of the people may have indirectly benefited by\r\nmany of these provisions; but when we look for measures of a directly\r\npopular character, only three can be found, namely, promises to enforce\r\npeace in the land, to take away evil customs, and to observe the laws of\r\nEdward Confessor as amended by William I. This is too slender a basis on\r\nwhich to found a claim to take rank as a “national king,” even if Henry\r\nhad any intention of keeping his promises. It is now notorious that not\r\na single promise remained unbroken.[170]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 170:\r\n\r\n  See Round, _Feudal England_, 227, and Pollock and Maitland, I. 306.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFrom another point of view the charter is a criticism on the\r\nadministration of Rufus (and to some extent also of the Conqueror),\r\ncombined with a promise of amendment. Henry thus posed as a reformer,\r\nand forswore the evil customs of his father and brother. The great value\r\nof the charter, however, lies in this, that it is the first formal\r\nacceptance (published under seal and in proper legal shape) of the old\r\nlaw of Anglo-Saxon England by a ruler of the new alien dynasty; yet in\r\nthis Henry was only completing what his father had begun. These\r\nconsiderations help to account for the almost exaggerated importance\r\nattached to Henry’s charter during the reign of John.\r\n\r\nIf all efforts made to defeat Henry’s succession failed, the succession\r\nof his daughter Matilda was disputed triumphantly. Stephen, taking\r\nadvantage of his cousin’s absence and of her personal unpopularity, made\r\na rapid descent on England with the spasmodic energy which characterized\r\nhim, and successfully snatched the Crown. Trained in English ways on\r\nEnglish soil, he was quickly on the spot and very popular. These\r\nfeatures in his favour, however, did not render his position entirely\r\nsecure as against the daughter and heiress of so strong a King as Henry\r\nI., to whom, indeed, Stephen himself, with all the magnates of England,\r\nhad already thrice sworn allegiance. He was only one of two competitors\r\nfor the Crown, with chances nearly equal. From the moment of the old\r\nKing’s death, “the Norman barons treated the succession as an open\r\nquestion.” In these words of Bishop Stubbs,[171] Mr. J. H. Round\r\nfinds[172] the keynote of the reign. Stephen was never secure on his\r\nthrone, and had to make indiscriminate promises first to obtain, and\r\nafterwards to retain, his position. He was thus prepared to bid much\r\nhigher for support than Henry had felt compelled to do. Adherents had to\r\nbe gained painfully, one by one, by the grant of special favours to\r\nevery individual whose support was worth the buying.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 171:\r\n\r\n  Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, I. 345.\r\n\r\nFootnote 172:\r\n\r\n  Round, _Geoffrey de Mandeville_, p. 1.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBargains were struck with the Londoners, with Stephen’s brother Henry of\r\nBlois (Bishop of Winchester), with the Keepers of the King’s Treasure,\r\nwith the Archbishop of Canterbury, and with the Justiciar (Bishop Roger\r\nof Salisbury). The support of the two last mentioned carried with it the\r\nsupport of the Church and of the administrative staff of the late king,\r\nbut was only gained by wide concessions. Thus Stephen, like William of\r\nOrange, five centuries later, agreed to become “king upon conditions.” A\r\nCharter of Liberties and a solemn oath securing \"the liberty of the\r\nChurch\"—a vague phrase, it is true, but none the less dangerous on that\r\naccount—together formed the price of Stephen’s consecration; and this\r\nprice was not perhaps too high when we remember that \"election was a\r\nmatter of opinion, coronation a matter of fact\"—a solemn sacrament that\r\ncould hardly be undone.[173]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 173:\r\n\r\n  Round, _Geoffrey de Mandeville_, p. 6. Mr. Round, _ibid._, p. 438,\r\n  explains that the reason of the omission from this earlier charter of\r\n  Stephen (unlike the more lengthy and important one which followed four\r\n  months later) of all mention of the Church was that Stephen, at the\r\n  time of granting, supplemented it by the verbal promise recorded by\r\n  William of Malmesbury, _de libertate reddenda ecclesiae et\r\n  conservanda_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nEven this important ceremony, however, left Stephen’s throne a tottering\r\none; he was compelled to buy the adherence of powerful magnates by\r\nlavish concessions of land and franchises; and various charters in\r\nfavour of individual nobles still exist as witnesses to such bribes. The\r\nprocess by which he built up a title to the Crown seems to have\r\nculminated in the Easter of 1136, when he secured the support of\r\nMatilda’s half-brother Robert, Earl of Gloucester, whose lead was\r\nquickly followed by other influential nobles. All of these new\r\nadherents, however, performed homage to the King under an important\r\nreservation, namely, that their future loyalty would be strictly\r\nconditional on the treatment extended to them by Stephen. That\r\nunfortunate monarch accordingly, by tolerating such conditional\r\nallegiance, was compelled to acknowledge the inherent weakness of his\r\nposition even in the moment of his nominal triumph.[174]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 174:\r\n\r\n  The whole incident is so remarkable that it seems well to cite the\r\n  exact words of William of Malmesbury, II. 541: “_Itaque homagium regi\r\n  fecit sub conditione quadam, scilicet quamdiu ille dignitatem suam\r\n  integre custodiret et sibi pacta servaret_.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThese important transactions took place apparently at Oxford,[175] and\r\nat the same time the King issued his second or Oxford Charter, which\r\nembodied and expanded the contents of earlier charters and oaths. This\r\nOxford Charter, the date of which has been proved to be early in\r\nApril,[176] is noteworthy alike for the circumstances in which it was\r\ngranted, placing as it did the copestone on the gradual process by which\r\nStephen was “elected” king, and also for its contents, which combined\r\nthe earlier oath to the Church and the vague, unsatisfactory earlier\r\ncharter to the people, with the new conditions extorted by Earl Robert\r\nand his followers.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 175:\r\n\r\n  Round, _Geoffrey_, 22.\r\n\r\nFootnote 176:\r\n\r\n  Round, _Geoffrey_, 23–4.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe opening words, in which Stephen describes himself as “King of the\r\nEnglish,” may be read as a laboured attempt to set forth a valid title\r\nto the throne. All reference to predecessors is carefully avoided, and\r\nthe usurper declares himself to be king \"by appointment of the clergy\r\nand people, by consecration of the archbishop and papal legate, and by\r\nthe Pope’s confirmation.\"[177]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 177:\r\n\r\n  Stephen was not justified in this last assumption. See Round,\r\n  _Geoffrey_, 9.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nPerhaps its chief provisions are those in favour of the Church,\r\nsupplementing a vague declaration that the Church should be “free” by\r\nspecific promises that the bishops should have exclusive jurisdiction\r\nand power over churchmen and their goods, along with the sole right to\r\nsuperintend their distribution after death. Here was a clear\r\nconfirmation of the right of the Courts Christian to a monopoly of all\r\npleas affecting the clergy or their property. It is the first distinct\r\nenunciation in England of the principle afterwards known as \"benefit of\r\nclergy\"—and that, too, in a form more sweeping than was ever afterwards\r\nrepeated. Stephen also explicitly renounced all rights inherent in the\r\nCrown to wardship over Church lands during vacancies—a surrender never\r\ndreamed of by either Henry I. or Henry II.\r\n\r\nGrants to the people at large followed. A general clause promising peace\r\nand justice was again supplemented by specific concessions of more\r\npractical value, namely, a promise to extirpate all exactions, unjust\r\npractices, and “miskennings” by sheriffs and others, and to observe\r\ngood, ancient, and just customs in respect of murder-fines, pleas, and\r\nother causes.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, there is only one provision specially benefiting\r\nfeudal magnates, the King’s disclaimer of all tracts of land afforested\r\nsince the time of the two Williams. The omission of further feudal\r\nconcessions must not be attributed either to Stephen’s strength, or to\r\nany spirit of moderation or self-sacrifice in the magnates. Each baron\r\nof sufficient importance had already extorted a special charter in his\r\nown favour, more emphatic and binding from its personal nature, and\r\naccordingly more valued than a mere general provision in favour of all\r\nand sundry. Such private grants generally included a confirmation of the\r\ngrantee’s right to maintain his own feudal stronghold, thus placing him\r\nin a position of practical independence.\r\n\r\nIt is instructive to compare these wide promises of Stephen with the\r\nmeagre words of the charter granted by Henry of Anjou at or soon after\r\nhis Coronation.[178] Henry II. carefully omits all mention of Stephen\r\nand his charters, not, as is sometimes supposed, because he did not wish\r\nto acknowledge the existence of a usurper, but because of that usurper’s\r\nlavish grants to the Church. Henry had no intention either to confirm\r\n“benefit of clergy” in so sweeping a form as Stephen had done, or to\r\nrenounce wardship over the lands of vacant sees.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 178:\r\n\r\n  The charter of Henry II. is given in Bémont, _Chartes_, 13, and in\r\n  _Select Charters_, 135. It seems worth while to mention in this\r\n  connection a notable mistake of a writer whose usual accuracy is\r\n  envied by his brother historians. Mr. J. H. Round (_Engl. Hist. Rev._,\r\n  VIII. 292) declares that “the royal power had increased so steadily\r\n  that Henry II. and his sons had been able to abstain from issuing\r\n  charters, and had merely taken the old tripartite oath.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTo the Church, as to the barons, Henry Plantagenet confirms only what\r\nhis grandfather had already conceded. Even when compared with the\r\nstandard set by the charter of Henry I., that of the younger Henry is\r\nshorter and less explicit, and therefore weaker and more liable to be\r\nset aside—features which justified Stephen Langton in his preference for\r\nthe older document. If Henry II. granted a short and grudging charter,\r\nneither of his sons, at their respective coronations, granted any\r\ncharter at all. Reasons for the omission readily suggest themselves; the\r\nCrown had grown strong enough to dispense with this unwelcome formality,\r\npartly because of the absence of rival competitors for the throne, and\r\npartly because of the perfection to which the machinery of government\r\nhad been brought. The utmost which the Church could extract from Richard\r\nand John as the price of their consecration was the renewal of the three\r\nvague promises contained in the words of the oath, now taken as a pure\r\nformality. The omission to grant charters was merely one symptom of the\r\ndiseases of the body politic consequent on the overweening power of the\r\nCrown, and proves how urgent was the need of some such re-assertion of\r\nthe nation’s liberties as came in 1215.\r\n\r\nJohn, at least, was not to be allowed to shake himself free from the\r\nobligations of his oath, or from the promise to confirm the ancient laws\r\nand customs of the land therein contained. Stephen Langton, before\r\nabsolving him from the effects of his quarrel with Rome, compelled him\r\nto renew the terms of the coronation oath.[179]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 179:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, p. 32, and Round, _Eng. Hist. Rev._, VIII. 292.\r\n\r\nNor was this all; from a meeting held at St. Albans on 4th August, 1213,\r\nwrits were issued in the King’s name to the various sheriffs, bidding\r\nthem observe the laws of Henry I. and abstain from unjust\r\nexactions.[180] Three weeks later (on 25th August), the production of a\r\nstray copy of Henry’s charter is said, by Roger of Wendover, to have\r\nmade a startling impression on all present,[181] and the same charter\r\nwas a second time produced at Bury St. Edmunds, on 4th November, 1214,\r\nand was accepted by the malcontents as a model which, modified and\r\nenlarged, might serve as a basis for the redress of the grievances of\r\nthe reign.[182]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 180:\r\n\r\n  _Supra_, p. 34.\r\n\r\nFootnote 181:\r\n\r\n  _Supra_, p. 35.\r\n\r\nFootnote 182:\r\n\r\n  _Supra_, p. 38.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt is thus both excusable and necessary to place much stress on this\r\nsequence of coronation oaths and charters, as contributing both to the\r\nform and to the substance of the Magna Carta of John. Yet the tendency\r\nto take too narrow a view of the antecedents of the Great Charter must\r\nbe carefully guarded against. Many ingredients went to the making of it.\r\nNumerous reforms of Henry II., whether embodied or not in one or more of\r\nthe ordinances or assizes that have come down to us, must be reckoned\r\namong their number, equally with those constitutional documents which\r\nhappen to be couched in the form peculiar to charters granted under the\r\nking’s great seal. It is also necessary to remember the special grants\r\nmade by successive kings of England to the Church, to London and other\r\ncities, and to individual prelates and barons. In a sense, the whole\r\nprevious history of England went to the making of Magna Carta. The\r\nsequence of coronation oaths and charters is only one line of descent;\r\nthe Great Charter of John can trace its origin through many other lines\r\nof distinguished ancestors.\r\n\r\n            II. Magna Carta: its Form and Juridical Nature.\r\n\r\nMuch ingenuity has been expended, without adequate return, in the effort\r\nto discover which particular category of modern jurisprudence most\r\nexactly describes the Great Charter of John. Is it an enacted law, or a\r\ntreaty; the royal answer to a petition; or a declaration of rights? Is\r\nit a simple pact, bargain, or agreement between contracting parties? Or\r\nis it a combination of two or more of these? Something has been said in\r\nfavour of almost every possible view, perhaps more to the bewilderment\r\nthan to the enlightenment of students of history uninterested in legal\r\nsubtleties.\r\n\r\nThe claim of Magna Carta to rank as a formal act of legislation has been\r\nsupported on the ground that it was promulgated in what was practically\r\na _commune concilium_. King John, it is maintained, met in a national\r\nassembly all the estates of his realm who were then endowed with\r\npolitical rights, and these concurred with him in the granting of Magna\r\nCarta. The consent of all who claimed a share in the making or repealing\r\nof laws—archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and crown-tenants, great\r\nand small—entitles the Charter to rank as a regular statute.\r\n\r\nAgainst this view, however, technical informalities may be urged. Both\r\nthe composition of the Council and the procedure adopted there, were\r\nirregular. No formal writs of summons had been issued, and, therefore,\r\nthe meeting was never properly constituted; many individuals with the\r\nright and duty of attendance had no opportunity to be present. Further,\r\nthe whole proceedings were tumultuary; the barons assembled in military\r\narray and compelled the consent of John by turbulence and show of force.\r\nOn these grounds, modern jurisprudence, if appealed to, would reject the\r\nclaim of the Charter to be enrolled as an ordinary statute.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it may be argued that Magna Carta, while something\r\nless than a law, is also something more. A law made by the king in one\r\nnational assembly might be repealed by the king in another; whereas the\r\nGreat Charter was intended by the barons to be unchangeable. It was\r\ngranted to them and their heirs for ever; and, in return, a price had\r\nbeen paid, namely, the renewal of their allegiance—a fundamental\r\ncondition of John’s continued possession of the throne.[183]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 183:\r\n\r\n  The _quid pro quo_ received by the King was merely the promise of\r\n  _conditionel_ homage, dependent (as we learn from chapter 63) on his\r\n  observance of the conditions of the Charter. This arrangement may be\r\n  compared with the agreement made between Stephen and the Earl of\r\n  Gloucester in 1136 (see _supra_, p. 120), and it bears some points of\r\n  analogy with the procedure adopted by the framers of the Bill of\r\n  Rights, who inserted a list of conditions in the Act of Parliament\r\n  which formed the title of William and Mary to the throne of England.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMagna Carta has also been frequently described as a treaty. Such is the\r\nverdict of Dr. Stubbs.[184] “The Great Charter, although drawn up in the\r\nform of a royal grant, was really a treaty between the King and his\r\nsubjects.... It is the collective people who really form the other high\r\ncontracting party in the great capitulation.”[185] This view receives\r\nsome support from certain words contained in chapter 63 of the Charter\r\nitself: “_Juratum est autem tam ex parte nostra quam ex parte baronum,\r\nquod haec omnia supradicta bona fide et sine malo ingenio\r\nobservabuntur_.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 184:\r\n\r\n  _Const. Hist._, I. 569.\r\n\r\nFootnote 185:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Prothero is of the same opinion (_Simon de Montfort_, 15). It was\r\n  “in reality a treaty of peace, an engagement made after a defeat\r\n  between the vanquished and his victors.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt is not sufficient to urge against this theory, as is sometimes done,\r\nthat the concord was entered into in bad faith by one or by both of the\r\ncontracting parties. It is quite true that the compromise it contained\r\nwas accepted merely as a cloak under which to prepare for war; yet\r\njurisprudence, in treating of formal documents granted under seal, pays\r\nno attention to sincerity or insincerity, but looks merely to the formal\r\nexpression of consent.\r\n\r\nInteresting questions might also be raised as to how far it is correct\r\nto extend to treaties the legal rule which declares void or voidable all\r\ncompacts and agreements induced by force or fear. In a sense, every\r\ntreaty which ends a great war would fall under such condemnation, since\r\nthe vanquished nation always bows to _force majeure_. Such claims as the\r\nGreat Charter may have to rank as a treaty are not, therefore,\r\nnecessarily weakened by John’s subsequent contention that when granting\r\nit he was not a free agent.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a more radical objection. A treaty is a public act\r\nbetween two contracting powers, who must, to meet the requirements of\r\nmodern jurisprudence, be independent States or their accredited agents;\r\nwhile John and his opponents were merely fragments of one nation or\r\nState, torn asunder by mutual fears and jealousies.\r\n\r\nSome authorities discard alike the theory of legislation and the treaty\r\ntheory to make way for a third, namely, that Magna Carta is merely a\r\ncontract, pact, or private agreement. M. Emile Boutmy is of this\r\nopinion. \"Le caractère de cet acte est aisé à définir.[186] Ce n’est pas\r\nprécisément un traité, puisqu’il n’y a pas ici deux souverainetés\r\nlégitimes ni deux nations en présence; ce n’est pas non plus une loi;\r\nelle serait entachée d’irrégularité et de violence; c’est un compromis\r\nou un pacte.\"[187]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 186:\r\n\r\n  Here we differ from him.\r\n\r\nFootnote 187:\r\n\r\n  _Études de droit constitutionnel_, 41.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThus considered, the proudest act of the national drama would take its\r\nplace in the comparatively humble legal category which includes such\r\ntransactions as the hire of a waggon or the sale of a load of corn.\r\nThere are, however, fatal objections to this theory also. It is\r\ndifficult to see how the plea of “force,” if sufficient (as M. Boutmy\r\nurges) to render null the enactment of a public law, would not be even\r\nmore effective in reducing a private agreement. If Magna Carta has no\r\nother basis than the declared consent of the contracting parties, it\r\nseems safer to describe it as a public treaty than as a private or civil\r\npact devoid of political significance.\r\n\r\nOther theories also are possible; as, for example, that the Great\r\nCharter is of the nature of a Declaration of Rights, such as have played\r\nso prominent a part in the political history of France and of the United\r\nStates; while a recent American writer on English constitutional\r\ndevelopment seems almost to regard it as a code, creating a formal\r\nconstitution for England—in a rude and embryonic form, it is true. “If a\r\nconstitution has for its chief object the prevention of encroachments\r\nand the harmonizing of governmental institutions, Magna Carta answers to\r\nthat description, at least in part.”[188]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 188:\r\n\r\n  Prof. Jesse Macy, _English Constitution_, 162.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to find examples of attempts to compromise between\r\nthese competing theories, by combining two or more of them. Thus, a high\r\nEnglish authority declares that “the Great Charter is partly a\r\ndeclaration of rights, partly a treaty between Crown and people.”[189]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 189:\r\n\r\n  Sir William R. Anson, _Law of the Constitution_, I. 14.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe essential nature of what took place at Runnymede, in June, 1215, is\r\nplain, when stripped of legal subtleties. A bargain was struck between\r\nthe King and the rebel magnates, the purport of which was that the\r\nlatter should renew their oaths of fealty and homage, and give security\r\nthat they would keep these oaths, while John, in return, granted “to the\r\nfreemen of England and their heirs for ever” the liberties enumerated in\r\nsixty-three chapters. No one thought of asking whether the transaction\r\nthus concluded was a “treaty” or a private “contract.”\r\n\r\nThe terms of this bargain, however, had to be drawn up in proper legal\r\nform, so as to bear record for all time to the exact nature of the\r\nprovisions therein contained, and also to the authenticity of John’s\r\nconsent thereto. It was, therefore, reduced to writing, and the\r\nresulting document was naturally couched in the form invariably used for\r\nall irrevocable grants intended to descend from father to son, namely, a\r\nfeudal charter, authenticated by the addition of a seal—just as in the\r\ncase of a grant of land, and with many of the clauses appropriate to\r\nsuch a grant.[190]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 190:\r\n\r\n  In strict legal theory the complete investiture of the grantee\r\n  required that “charter” should be followed by “infeftment” or delivery\r\n  (real or constructive) of the subject of the grant. In the case of\r\n  such intangible things as political rights and liberties, the actual\r\n  parchment on which the Charter was written would be the most natural\r\n  symbol to deliver to the grantees.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nJohn grants to the freemen of England and their heirs certain specified\r\nrights and liberties, as though these were merely so many hides or acres\r\nof land. _Concessimus etiam omnibus liberis hominibus regni nostri, pro\r\nnobis et haeredibus nostris in perpetuum, omnes libertates subscriptas,\r\nhabendas et tenendas, eis et haeredibus suis, de nobis et haeredibus\r\nnostris._[191] The legal effect of such a grant is hard to determine;\r\nand insuperable difficulties beset any attempt to expound its legal\r\nconsequences in terms of modern law.[192] In truth, the form and\r\nsubstance of Magna Carta are badly mated. Its substance consists of a\r\nnumber of legal enactments and political and civil rights; its form is\r\nborrowed from the feudal lawyer’s book of styles for conferring a title\r\nto landed estate.[193]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 191:\r\n\r\n  See chapter 1. The grant which thus purports to be perpetually binding\r\n  on John’s heirs, was in practice treated as purely personal to John,\r\n  and requiring confirmation by his son. Yet this also was in strict\r\n  accordance with feudal theory, which required the heir to complete his\r\n  title to his deceased father’s real estate by obtaining a Charter of\r\n  Confirmation from his lord, for which he had to pay “relief.” The\r\n  liberties of the freemen were only a new species of real estate.\r\n\r\nFootnote 192:\r\n\r\n  Prof. Maitland, _Township and Borough_, p. 76, explains some of the\r\n  absurdities involved: \"Have you ever pondered the form, the scheme,\r\n  the main idea of Magna Charta? If so, your reverence for that sacred\r\n  text will hardly have prevented you from using in the privacy of your\r\n  own minds some such words as ‘inept’ or ‘childish.’ King John makes a\r\n  grant to the men of England and their heirs. The men of England and\r\n  their heirs are to hold certain liberties of that prince and his heirs\r\n  for ever. Imagine yourself imprisoned without the lawful judgment of\r\n  your peers, and striving to prove while you languish in gaol that you\r\n  are heir to one of the original grantees. Nowadays it is only at a\r\n  rhetorical moment that Englishmen ‘inherit’ their liberties, their\r\n  constitution, their public law. When sober, they do nothing of the\r\n  kind. But, whatever may have ‘quivered on the lip’ of Cardinal Langton\r\n  and the prelates and barons at Runnymead, the speech that came was the\r\n  speech of feoffment. Law, if it is to endure, must be inherited. If\r\n  all Englishmen have liberties, every Englishman has something, some\r\n  thing, that he can transmit to his heir. Public law cannot free itself\r\n  from the forms, the individualistic forms of private law.\"\r\n\r\nFootnote 193:\r\n\r\n  Pollock and Maitland, I. 150, emphasize this disparity. “In form a\r\n  donation, a grant of franchises freely made by the king, in reality a\r\n  treaty extorted from him by the confederate estates of the realm, ...\r\n  it is also a long and miscellaneous code of laws.” Cf. also _Ibid._,\r\n  I. 658.\r\n\r\nThe results of this inquiry seem then to be completely negative. It is\r\nuseless to describe phenomena of the thirteenth century in modern\r\nphraseology which would have been unintelligible to contemporaries.\r\nMedieval lawyers experienced great difficulties in trying to express the\r\nactual facts of their day in terms of such categories of the Roman\r\njurisprudence as had survived the fall of Rome and Roman civilization.\r\nThere is no one of the ancient or modern categories which can be applied\r\nwith confidence to the Great Charter or to the transaction of which it\r\nis the record. Magna Carta may perhaps be described as a treaty or a\r\ncontract which enacts or proclaims a number of rules and customs as\r\nbinding in England, and reduces them to writing in the unsuitable form\r\nof a feudal charter granted by King John to the freemen of England and\r\ntheir heirs.\r\n\r\n          III. Magna Carta: its Contents and Characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe confirmation of the rights enumerated in the sixty-three chapters of\r\nthe Charter represented the price paid by John for the renewed\r\nallegiance of the rebels. These rights are fully discussed, one by one,\r\nin the second part of the present volume: a brief description of their\r\nmore prominent characteristics, when viewed as a collective whole, is,\r\ntherefore, all that is here required.\r\n\r\nIn the attempt to analyze the leading provisions, various principles of\r\nclassification have been adopted. Three of these stand out prominently:\r\nthe various chapters may be arranged according to the functions of the\r\ncentral government which they were intended to limit; according to their\r\nown nature as progressive, reactionary, or merely declaratory; and,\r\nfinally, according to the classes of the community which reaped the\r\ngreatest benefit.\r\n\r\nI. _Provisions classified according to the various prerogatives of the\r\nCrown which they affect._\r\n\r\nDr. Gneist[194] adopts this principle of division, and arranges the\r\nchapters of Magna Carta into five groups according as they place legal\r\nlimitations (1) on the feudal military power of the Crown, (2) on its\r\njudicial power, (3) on its police power, (4) on its financial power, or\r\n(5) furnish a legal sanction for the enforcement of the whole. In spite\r\nof Dr. Gneist’s high authority, it is doubtful whether an analysis of\r\nMagna Carta upon these somewhat arbitrary lines throws much light on its\r\nmain objects or results. Such a division, if convenient for some\r\npurposes, seems artificial and unreal, since it is founded on\r\ndistinctions which were not clearly formulated in the thirteenth\r\ncentury. The adoption of such a principle of classification with\r\nreference to a period when the various functions of the executive were\r\nstill blended together indiscriminately is somewhat of an\r\nanachronism.[195]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 194:\r\n\r\n  _Hist. Engl. Const._, Chapter XVIII.\r\n\r\nFootnote 195:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Gneist indeed almost confesses this, when, in discussing the\r\n  limitations of the financial power, he feels constrained to say that\r\n  many of these are “already comprised in the provisions touching the\r\n  feudal power.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nII. _Provisions classified according as they are of a progressive,\r\nreactionary, or declaratory nature._\r\n\r\nAmong the many questions pressing for answer, none seem more natural\r\nthan those which inquire into the relations between the promises made in\r\nthe Charter and the system of government actually at work under Henry of\r\nAnjou and his sons; or the relations between these promises and the\r\nstill older laws of Edward Confessor.\r\n\r\nThe view generally entertained is that the provisions of Magna Carta are\r\nchiefly, if not exclusively, of a declaratory nature. The Great Charter\r\nhas for many centuries been described as an attempt to confirm and\r\ndefine existing customs rather than to change them. In the words of\r\nBlackstone,[196] writing in 1759, “It is agreed by all our historians\r\nthat the Great Charter of King John was for the most part compiled from\r\nthe ancient customs of the realm, or the laws of King Edward the\r\nConfessor, by which they usually mean the common law, which was\r\nestablished under our Saxon princes, before the rigours of feudal\r\ntenures and other hardships were imported from the continent.”\r\nSubstantially the same doctrine has been enunciated only the other day,\r\nby our highest authority. \"On the whole, the charter contains little\r\nthat is absolutely new. It is restorative. John in these last years has\r\nbeen breaking the law; therefore the law must be defined and set in\r\nwriting.[197] This view seems, on the whole, a correct one; the\r\ninsurgents in 1215 professed to be demanding nothing new, but merely a\r\nreturn to the good laws of Edward Confessor, as supplemented by the\r\npromises contained in the charter of Henry I. An unbroken thread runs\r\nback from Magna Carta to the laws and customs of Anglo-Saxon England and\r\nthe old coronation oaths of Ethelred and Edgar. Yet the Great Charter\r\ncontained much that was unknown to the days of the Confessor and had no\r\nplace in the promises of Henry I. In many points of detail the Charter\r\nmust look for its antecedents rather to the administrative changes\r\nintroduced by Henry II. than to the old customary law that prevailed\r\nbefore the Conquest.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 196:\r\n\r\n  _Great Charter_, vii.\r\n\r\nFootnote 197:\r\n\r\n  Pollock and Maitland, I. 151.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThus it is not sufficient to describe Magna Carta merely as a\r\ndeclaratory enactment; it is necessary to distinguish between the\r\ndifferent sources of what it declared. A fourfold division may be\r\nsuggested. (1) Magna Carta embodied and handed down to future ages some\r\nof the usages of the old customary law of Anglo-Saxon England, unchanged\r\nby the Conqueror or his successors, now confirmed and purified from\r\nabuses. (2) In defining feudal incidents and services, it confirmed many\r\nrules of the feudal law brought into England by the Normans subsequently\r\nto 1066. (3) It also embodied many provisions of which William I. and\r\neven Henry I. knew no more than did the Anglo-Saxon kings—innovations\r\nintroduced for his own purposes by Henry of Anjou, but, after half a\r\ncentury of experience, now accepted loyally even by the most bitter\r\nopponents of the Crown. In the words of Mr. Prothero, “We find ... the\r\njudicial and administrative system established by Henry II. preserved\r\nalmost intact in Magna Carta, though its abuse was carefully guarded\r\nagainst.”[198] Finally, (4) in some few points, the Charter actually\r\naimed at going farther than Henry II., great reformer as he was, had\r\nintended to go. Thus, to mention only two particulars, the Petty Assizes\r\nare to be taken in every county four times a year, while sheriffs and\r\nother local magistrates are entirely prohibited from holding pleas of\r\nthe Crown.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 198:\r\n\r\n  _Simon de Montfort_, 17.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThere are two further reasons why we cannot be content with an\r\nexplanation which dismisses Magna Carta with the bald statement that its\r\nprovisions are merely of a declaratory nature. History has proved the\r\nuniversal truth of the theory that a purely declaratory enactment is\r\nimpossible; since the mere lapse of time, by producing an altered\r\nhistorical context, necessarily changes the purport of any Statute when\r\nre-enacted in a later age. Even if words identically the same are\r\nrepeated, the new circumstances read into them a new meaning. Such is\r\nthe case even when the framers of these re-enactments are completely\r\nsincere, which, often, they are not. It is no unusual device for\r\ninnovators to render their reforms more palatable by presenting them\r\ndisguised as returns to the past. Magna Carta affords many illustrations\r\nof this. Its clauses, even where they profess to be merely confirmatory\r\nof the _status quo_, in reality alter existing custom.\r\n\r\nFurther, it is of vital importance to bear in mind the exact nature of\r\nthe provisions confirmed or declared. A re-statement of some of the more\r\nrecent reforms of Henry II. (or of those of Archbishop Hubert Walter,\r\nfollowing in his footsteps) leads logically to progress rather than to\r\nmere stability; while the professed confirmation of Anglo-Saxon usages\r\nor of ancient feudal customs, fast disappearing under the new _régime_,\r\nimplies retrogression rather than standing still. Chapters 34 and 39 of\r\nMagna Carta, for example, are of this latter kind. They really demand a\r\nreturn to the system in vogue prior to the innovations of Henry II. when\r\nthey declare in favour of feudal jurisdictions. Thus, some of the\r\nprovisions of the Great Charter which, at a casual glance, appear to be\r\ncorrectly described as declaratory, are, in reality, innovations; while\r\nothers tend towards reaction.\r\n\r\nIII. _Provisions classified according to the estates of the community in\r\nwhose favour they were conceived._\r\n\r\nThis third principle of arrangement would stand condemned as completely\r\nmisleading, if it were necessary to accept as true, in any literal\r\nsense, the assertions so frequently made concerning the absolute\r\nequality of all classes and interests before the law—as that law was\r\nembodied in Magna Carta. Here, then, we are face to face with a\r\nfundamental question of immense importance: Does the Great Charter\r\nreally, as the orthodox traditional view so vehemently asserts, protect\r\nthe rights of the whole mass of humble Englishmen equally with those of\r\nthe proudest noble? Is it really a great bulwark of the constitutional\r\nliberties of the nation, considered as a nation, in any broad sense of\r\nthat word? Or is it rather, in the main, a series of concessions to\r\nfeudal selfishness wrung from the King by a handful of powerful\r\naristocrats? On such questions, learned opinion is sharply divided,\r\nalthough an overwhelming majority of authorities range themselves on the\r\npopular side, from Coke (who assumes in every page of his _Second\r\nInstitute_ that the rights won in 1215 were as valuable for the villein\r\nas for the baron) down to writers of the present day. Lord Chatham in\r\none of his great orations[199] insisted that the barons who wrested the\r\nCharter from John established claims to the gratitude of posterity\r\nbecause they “did not confine it to themselves alone, but delivered it\r\nas a common blessing to the whole people”; and Sir Edward Creasy,[200]\r\nin citing Chatham’s words with approval, caps them with more ecstatic\r\nwords of his own, declaring that one effect of the Charter was “to give\r\nand to guarantee full protection for property and person to every human\r\nbeing that breathes English air.” Lord Chatham indeed spoke with the\r\nunrestrained enthusiasm of an orator; yet staid lawyers and historians\r\nlike Blackstone and Hallam seem to vie with him in similar expressions.\r\n“An equal distribution of civil rights to all classes of freemen forms\r\nthe peculiar beauty of the charter”; so we are told by Hallam.[201]\r\nBishop Stubbs unequivocally enunciated the same doctrine. “Clause by\r\nclause the rights of the commons are provided for as well as the rights\r\nof the nobles.... This proves, if any proof were wanted, that the\r\ndemands of the barons were no selfish exactions of privilege for\r\nthemselves.”[202]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 199:\r\n\r\n  House of Lords, 9th January, 1770.\r\n\r\nFootnote 200:\r\n\r\n  _History of English Constitution_, 151.\r\n\r\nFootnote 201:\r\n\r\n  _Middle Ages_, II. 447.\r\n\r\nFootnote 202:\r\n\r\n  _Const. Hist._, I. 570-1.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nDr. Gneist is of the same opinion. “Magna Carta was a pledge of\r\nreconciliation between all classes. Its existence and ratification\r\nmaintained for centuries the notion of fundamental rights as applicable\r\nto all classes in the consciousness that no liberties would be upheld by\r\nthe superior classes for any length of time, without guarantees of\r\npersonal liberties for the humble also.”[203]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 203:\r\n\r\n  Gneist, _Hist. of Engl. Parl._ (trans. by A. H. Keane), 103. Cf. his\r\n  _Const. Hist._ (trans. by P. A. Ashworth), 253. “A separate right for\r\n  nobles, citizens, and peasants, was no longer possible.”\r\n\r\n“The rights which the barons claimed for themselves,” says John Richard\r\nGreen,[204] before proceeding to enumerate them, “they claimed for the\r\nnation at large.” The testimony of a very recent writer, Dr. Hannis\r\nTaylor,[205] may close this series. “As all three orders participated\r\nequally in its fruits, the great act at Runnymede was in the fullest\r\nsense of the term a national act, and not a mere act of the baronage on\r\nbehalf of their own special privileges.” It would be easy to add to this\r\n“cloud of witnesses,” but enough has been said to prove that it has been\r\na common boast of Englishmen, for many centuries, that the provisions of\r\nthe Great Charter were intended to secure, and did secure, the liberties\r\nof every class and individual of the nation, not merely those of the\r\nfeudal magnates on whose initiative the quarrel was raised.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 204:\r\n\r\n  _Short History of the English People_, 124.\r\n\r\nFootnote 205:\r\n\r\n  _English Constitution_, I. 380.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten, however, that the truth of historical\r\nquestions does not depend on the counting of votes, or the weight of\r\nauthority; nor that a vigorous minority has always protested on the\r\nother side. “It has been lately the fashion,” Hallam confesses, “to\r\ndepreciate the value of Magna Charta, as if it had sprung from the\r\nprivate ambition of a few selfish barons, and redressed only some feudal\r\nabuses.”[206] It is not safe to accept, without a careful consideration\r\nof the evidence, the opinions cited even from such high authorities.\r\n“Equality” is essentially a modern ideal: in 1215, the various estates\r\nof the realm may have set out on the journey which was ultimately to\r\nlead them to this conception, but they had not yet reached their goal.\r\nFor many centuries after the thirteenth, class legislation maintained\r\nits prominent place on the Statute Rolls, and the interests of the\r\nvarious classes were by no means always identical.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 206:\r\n\r\n  _Middle Ages_, II. 447. See, _e.g._ Robert Brady, _A Full and Clear\r\n  Answer_ (1683).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTwo different parts of the Charter have a bearing on this question;\r\nnamely, chapter 1, which explains to whom the rights were granted, and\r\nchapter 61, which declares by whom they were to be enforced. John’s\r\nwords clearly tell us that the liberties were confirmed “to all freemen\r\nof my kingdom and their heirs for ever.” This opens up the crucial\r\nquestion—who were _freemen_ in 1215?\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm, natural and even laudable in its proper place, although\r\nfatal to historical accuracy in its results, which seeks to enhance the\r\nmerits of Magna Carta by exalting its provisions and extending their\r\nscope as widely as possible, has led commentators to stretch the meaning\r\nof “freeman” to its utmost limits. The word has even been treated as\r\nembracing the entire population of England, including not only\r\nchurchmen, merchants, and yeomen, but even villeins as well. There are\r\nreasons, however, for believing that it should be understood in a sense\r\nmuch more restricted, although the subject is darkened by the vagueness\r\nof the word, and by the difficulty of determining whether it bears any\r\ntechnical signification or not. “Homo,” in medieval law-Latin, has a\r\npeculiar meaning, and was originally used as synonymous with \"baro\"—all\r\nfeudal vassals, whether of the Crown or of mesne lords, being described\r\nas “men” or “barons.” The word was sometimes indeed more loosely used,\r\nas may have been the case in chapter 1. Yet Magna Carta is a feudal\r\ncharter, and the presumption is in favour of the technical feudal\r\nmeaning of the word—a presumption certainly not weakened by the addition\r\nof an adjective confining it to the “free.” This qualifying word\r\ncertainly excluded villeins, and possibly also the great burgess class,\r\nor many of them. There is a passage in the _Dialogus de Scaccario_\r\n(dating from the close of the reign of Henry II.), in which Richard\r\nFitz-Nigel reckons even the richest burgesses and traders as not fully\r\nfree. He discusses the legal position of any knight (_miles_) or other\r\nfreeman (_liber homo_) losing his status by engaging in commerce in\r\norder to make money.[207] This does not prove that rich townsmen were\r\nranked with the _villani_ of the rural districts; but it does raise a\r\nserious doubt whether in the strict legal language of feudal charters\r\nthe words _liberi homines_ would be interpreted by contemporary lawyers\r\nas including the trading classes. Such doubts are strengthened by a\r\nnarrow scrutiny of those passages of the Charter in which the term\r\noccurs. In chapter 34 the _liber homo_ is, apparently, assumed to be a\r\nlandowner with a private manorial jurisdiction of which he may be\r\ndeprived. In other words, he is the holder of a freehold estate of some\r\nextent—a great barony or, at the least, a manor. In this part of the\r\nCharter the “freeman” is clearly a county gentleman.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 207:\r\n\r\n  _Dialogus_, II. xiii. c.\r\n\r\nIs the “freeman” of chapter 1 something different? The question must be\r\nconsidered an open one; but much might be said in favour of the opinion\r\nthat “freeman” as used in the Charter is synonymous with “freeholder”;\r\nand that therefore only a limited class could, as grantees or the heirs\r\nof such, make good a _legal_ claim to share in the liberties secured by\r\nMagna Carta.[208]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 208:\r\n\r\n  In addition to its appearance in the two places mentioned in the text,\r\n  the word “freeman” appears in five other chapters, namely 15, 20, 27,\r\n  30, and 39. The three last instances throw no light on the meaning of\r\n  the word, since the context of each would be satisfied either with a\r\n  broader or with a narrower interpretation. It is different, however,\r\n  with chapter 15, where the freemen are necessarily the feudal tenants\r\n  of a mesne lord—that is, freeholders; and with chapter 20, where, in\r\n  the matter of amercement, the freeman is distinctly contrasted with\r\n  the _villanus_. Further, where men of servile birth are clearly meant,\r\n  they are described generally as _probi homines_ (_e.g._ in chapters\r\n  20, 29, and 48), and in one place, chapter 26, as _legales homines_.\r\n  Chapter 44 mentions _homines_ without any qualification. It seems safe\r\n  to infer that the Great Charter never spoke of “freemen” when it meant\r\n  to include the ordinary peasantry or villagers. In chapter 39 of the\r\n  re-issue of 1217, _liber homo_ is clearly used as synonymous with\r\n  “freeholder.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTo the question, who had authority to enforce its provisions, the Great\r\nCharter has likewise a clear answer, namely, a select band or\r\nquasi-committee of twenty-five barons. Although the Mayor of London was\r\nchosen among their number, it is clear that no strong support for any\r\ndemocratic interpretation of Magna Carta can be founded on the choice of\r\nexecutors; since these formed a distinctly aristocratic body. Yet this\r\ntendency to vest power exclusively in an oligarchy composed of the heads\r\nof great families may have been counteracted, so it is possible to\r\ncontend, by the invitation extended by the same chapter to the _communa\r\ntotius terrae_ to assist the twenty-five Executors against the King in\r\nthe event of his breaking faith. Unfortunately, the extreme vagueness of\r\nthe phrase makes it rash in a high degree to build conclusions on such\r\nfoundations. It is possible to interpret the words _communa totius\r\nterrae_ as applying merely to “the community of freeholders of the\r\nland,” or even to “the community of barons of the land,” as well as to\r\n“the community of all the estates (including churchmen, merchants, and\r\ncommons) of the land,” as is usually done on no authority save\r\nconjecture. Every body of men was known in the thirteenth century as a\r\n_communa_; a word of exceedingly loose connotation.\r\n\r\nSo far, our investigations by no means prove that the equality of all\r\nclasses, or the equal participation by all in the privileges of the\r\nCharter, was an ideal, consciously or unconsciously, held by the leaders\r\nof the revolt against King John. Magna Carta itself contains evidences\r\nwhich point the other way, namely, to the existence of class\r\nlegislation. At the beginning and end of the Charter, clauses are\r\ncarefully inserted to secure to the Church its “freedom” and privileges;\r\nchurchmen, in their special interests, must be safeguarded, whoever else\r\nmay suffer. “Benefit of clergy,” thus secured, implies the very opposite\r\nof “equality before the law.” Other interests also receive separate and\r\nprivileged treatment. Many, perhaps most, of the chapters have no value\r\nexcept to landowners; a few affect tradesmen and townsmen exclusively,\r\nwhile chapters 20 to 22 adopt distinct sets of rules for the amercement\r\nof the ordinary freeman, the churchman, and the earl or baron\r\nrespectively—an anticipation, almost, of the later division into the\r\nthree estates of the realm—commons, clergy, and lords temporal. A\r\ncareful distinction is occasionally made (for example, in chapter 20)\r\nbetween the freeman and the villein, and the latter (as will be proved\r\nlater on) was carefully excluded from many of the benefits conferred on\r\nothers by Magna Carta. In this connection, it is interesting to consider\r\nhow each separate class would have been affected if John’s promises had\r\nbeen loyally kept.\r\n\r\n(1) _The Feudal Aristocracy._ Even a casual glance at the clauses of the\r\nGreat Charter shows how prominently abuses of feudal rights and\r\nobligations bulked in the eyes of its promoters. Provisions of this type\r\nmust be considered chiefly as concessions to the feudal\r\naristocracy—although it is true that the relief primarily intended for\r\nthem indirectly benefited other classes as well.\r\n\r\n(2) _Churchmen._ The position of the Church is easily understood when we\r\nneglect the privileges enjoyed by its great men _quâ_ barons rather than\r\n_quâ_ prelates. The special Church clauses found no place whatsoever in\r\nthe Articles of the Barons, but bear every appearance of having been\r\ntacked on as an after-thought, due probably to the influence of Stephen\r\nLangton.[209] Further, they are mainly confirmatory of the separate\r\nCharter already twice granted within the few preceding months. The\r\nNational Church indeed, with all its patriotism, had been careful to\r\nsecure its own selfish advantage before the political crisis arrived.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 209:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, p. 50.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(3) _Tenants of Mesne Lords._ When raising troops with the object of\r\ncompelling John to grant Magna Carta by parade of armed might, the\r\nbarons were perforce obliged to rely on the loyal support of their own\r\nfreeholders. It was essential that the knights and others who held under\r\nthem should be ready to fight for their mesne lords rather than for the\r\nKing their lord paramount. It was thus absolutely necessary that these\r\nunder-tenants should receive some recognition of their claims in the\r\nprovisions of the final settlement. Concessions conceived in their\r\nfavour are contained in two clauses (couched apparently in no specially\r\ngenerous spirit), namely, chapters 15 and 60. The former limits the\r\nnumber of occasions on which aids might be extorted from sub-tenants by\r\ntheir mesne lords to the same three as were recognized in the case of\r\nthe Crown. Less than this the barons could scarcely have granted.\r\nChapter 60 provides generally, in vague words, that all the customs and\r\nliberties which John agrees to observe towards his vassals shall be also\r\nobserved by mesne lords, whether prelates or laymen, towards their\r\nsub-vassals. This provision has met with a chorus of applause from\r\nmodern writers. Prof. Prothero declares[210] that “the sub-tenant was in\r\nall cases as scrupulously protected as the tenant-in-chief.” Dr. Hannis\r\nTaylor[211] is even more enthusiastic. “Animated by a broad spirit of\r\ngenerous patriotism, the barons stipulated in the treaty that every\r\nlimitation imposed for their protection upon the feudal rights of the\r\nking should also be imposed upon their rights as mesne lords in favour\r\nof the under-tenants who held of them.”[212] It must, however, be\r\nremembered that a vague general clause affords less protection than a\r\ndefinite specific privilege; and that in a rude age such a general\r\ndeclaration of principle might readily be infringed when occasion arose.\r\nThe barons were compelled to do something, or to pretend to do\r\nsomething, for their under-tenants. Apparently they did as little as\r\nthey, with safety or decency, could.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 210:\r\n\r\n  _S. de Montfort_, 17.\r\n\r\nFootnote 211:\r\n\r\n  _English Constitution_, I. 383.\r\n\r\nFootnote 212:\r\n\r\n  Bishop Stubbs, Preface to _W. Coventry_, II. lxxii., represents the\r\n  barons, in their fervour for abstract law, as actually supporting\r\n  their own vassals against themselves: “the barons of Runnymede guard\r\n  the people against themselves as well as against the common tyrant.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(4) Something was also done for the _merchant and trading classes_, but,\r\nwhen we subtract what has been read into the Charter by democratic\r\nenthusiasts of later ages, not so much as might reasonably be expected\r\nin a truly national document. The existing privileges of the great city\r\nof London were confirmed, without specification, in the Articles of the\r\nBarons; and some slight reforms in favour of its citizens (not too\r\ndefinitely worded) were then added. An attentive examination seems to\r\nsuggest, however, that these privileges were carefully refined away when\r\nthe Articles were reduced to their final form in Magna Carta. The right\r\nto tallage London and other towns was carefully reserved to the Crown,\r\nwhile the rights of free trading granted to foreigners were clearly\r\ninconsistent with the policy of monopoly and protection dear to the\r\nhearts of the Londoners. A mere confirmation to the citizens of existing\r\ncustoms, already bought and paid for at a great price, seems but a poor\r\nreturn for the support given by them to the movement of insurrection at\r\na critical moment when John was bidding high on the opposite side, and\r\nwhen their adherence was sufficient to turn the scale. The marvel is\r\nthat so little was done for them.[213]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 213:\r\n\r\n  For details, see _infra_ under cc. 12, 13, 35, and 41. It is\r\n  instructive to compare these chapters with the corresponding\r\n  provisions of the Articles of the Barons (viz. articles 32, 12, and\r\n  31). The alterations (though slight) seem to show that some new\r\n  influence affecting only the later document was inimical to the towns.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(5) The relation of the _villein_ to the benefits of the Charter has\r\nbeen hotly discussed. Coke claims for him, in regard to the important\r\nprovisions of chapter 39 at least, that he must be regarded as a _liber\r\nhomo_, and therefore as a full participant in all the advantages of the\r\nclause.[214] This contention is not well founded. Even admitting the\r\nrelativity of the word _liber_ in the thirteenth century, and admitting\r\nalso that the villein performed some of the duties, if he enjoyed none\r\nof the rights of the free-born, still the formal description _liber\r\nhomo_, when used in a feudal charter, cannot be stretched to cover those\r\nuseful manorial chattels that had no recognized place in the feudal\r\nscheme of society or in the political constitution of England, however\r\nnecessary they might be in the scheme of the particular manor to the\r\nsoil of which they were attached.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 214:\r\n\r\n  See Coke, _Second Institute_, p. 45, “for they are free against all\r\n  men, saving against their lord.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nEven if we exclude the villein from the general benefits of the grant,\r\nit may be, and has been, maintained that some few privileges were\r\ninsured to him in his own name. One clause at least is specially framed\r\nfor his protection. The villein, so it is provided in chapter 21, must\r\nnot be so cruelly amerced as to leave him utterly destitute; his plough\r\nand its equipment must be saved to him. Such concessions, however, are\r\nquite consistent with a denial of all _political_ rights, and even of\r\nall _civil_ rights, as these are understood in a modern age. The Crown\r\nand the magnates, so it may be urged, were only consulting their own\r\ninterests when they left the villein the means to carry on his farming\r\noperations, and so to pay off the balance of his debts in the future.\r\nThe closeness of his bond to the lord of his manor made it impossible to\r\ncrush the one without slightly injuring the other. The villein was\r\nprotected, not as the acknowledged subject of legal rights, but because\r\nhe formed a valuable asset of his lord. This attitude is illustrated by\r\na somewhat peculiar expression used in chapter 4, which prohibited\r\ninjury to the estate of a ward by “waste of men or things.” For a\r\nguardian to raise a villein to the status of a freeman was to benefit\r\nthe enfranchised peasant at the expense of his young master.[215]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 215:\r\n\r\n  Cf. under c. 4 _infra_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOther clauses both of John’s Charter and of the various re-issues show\r\nscrupulous care to avoid infringing the rights of property enjoyed by\r\nmanorial lords over their villeins. The King could not amerce other\r\npeople’s villeins harshly, although those on his own farms might be\r\namerced at his discretion. Chapter 16, while carefully prohibiting any\r\narbitrary increase of service from freehold property, leaves by\r\ninference all villein holdings unprotected. Then the “farms” or rents of\r\nancient demesne might be arbitrarily raised by the Crown,[216] and\r\ntallages might be arbitrarily taken (measures likely to press hardly on\r\nthe villein class). The villein was deliberately left exposed to the\r\nworst forms of purveyance, from which chapters 28 and 30 rescued his\r\nbetters. The horses and implements of the _villanus_ were still at the\r\nmercy of the Crown’s purveyors. The re-issue of 1217 confirms this view;\r\nwhile demesne waggons were protected, those of villeins were left\r\nexposed.[217] Again, the chapter which takes the place of the famous\r\nchapter 39 of 1215[218] makes it clear that lands held in villeinage are\r\nnot to be protected from arbitrary disseisin or dispossession. The\r\nvillein was left by the common law merely a tenant-at-will—subject to\r\narbitrary ejectment by his lord—whatever meagre measure of protection he\r\nmight obtain under the “custom of the manor” as interpreted by the court\r\nof the lord who oppressed him.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 216:\r\n\r\n  See under c. 25 _infra_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 217:\r\n\r\n  See chapter 26 of 1217.\r\n\r\nFootnote 218:\r\n\r\n  See chapter 35 of 1217.\r\n\r\nEven if it were possible to neglect the significance of any one of these\r\nsomewhat trivial points, when all of them are placed side by side their\r\nmeaning is clear. If the bulk of the English peasantry were protected at\r\nall by Magna Carta that was merely because they formed valuable assets\r\nof their lords. The Charter viewed them as \"villeins regardant\"—as\r\nchattels attached to a manor, not as members of an English\r\ncommonwealth.[219]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 219:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Stubbs takes an entirely different view. While admitting that\r\n  there is “so little notice of the villeins in the charter,” he\r\n  explains the omission apparently on two distinct grounds, (1) that\r\n  they had fewer grievances to redress than members of other classes,\r\n  and (2) that they participated in all the grants from which they were\r\n  not specially excluded. “It was not that they had no spokesman, but\r\n  that they were free from the more pressing grievances, and benefited\r\n  from every general provision.” Preface to _W. Coventry_, II., lxxiii.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe general conclusion to be derived from this survey is that, while\r\nmuch praise may be due to the baronial leaders for their comparatively\r\nliberal interest in the rights of others, they are scarcely entitled to\r\nthe excessive laudation they have sometimes received. The rude\r\nbeginnings of many features which have since come into prominence in\r\nEnglish institutions (such as the conceptions of patriotism and\r\nnationality and the principles of equality before the law and the tender\r\nregard for the rights of the humble) may possibly be found in the germ\r\nin some parts of the completed Charter; but the Articles of the Barons\r\nwere what their name implies, a baronial manifesto, seeking chiefly to\r\nredress the private grievances of the promoters, and mainly selfish in\r\nmotive.\r\n\r\nYet, when all deductions have been made (and it has seemed necessary to\r\ndo this with emphasis in order to redress the false balance created by\r\nthe exaggerations of enthusiasts), the Great Charter still stands out as\r\na prominent landmark in the sequence of events which have led, in an\r\nunbroken chain, to the consolidation of the English nation, and to the\r\nestablishment of a free and constitutional form of polity upon a basis\r\nso enduring that, after more than eight centuries of growth, it still\r\nretains the vigour and the buoyancy of youth.\r\n\r\n               IV. Magna Carta: an Estimate of its Value.\r\n\r\nNo evidence survives to show that the men of John’s reign placed any\r\nexcessive or exaggerated importance on the Great Charter; but, without a\r\nbreak since then, the estimate of its worth steadily increased until it\r\ncame to be regarded almost as a fetish among English lawyers and\r\nhistorians. No estimate of its value can be too high, and no words too\r\nemphatic or glowing to satisfy its votaries. In many a time of national\r\ncrisis, Magna Carta has been confidently appealed to as a fundamental\r\nlaw too sacred to be altered—as a talisman containing some magic spell,\r\ncapable of averting national calamity.\r\n\r\nAre these estimates of its value justified by facts, or are they gross\r\nexaggerations? Did it really create an epoch in English history? If so,\r\nwherein did its importance exactly lie?\r\n\r\nThe numerous factors which contributed towards the worth of Magna Carta\r\nmay be distinguished as of two kinds, intrinsic and extrinsic. (1) Its\r\nintrinsic value depends on the nature of its own provisions. The reforms\r\ndemanded by the barons and granted by this Charter were just and\r\nmoderate. The avoidance of all extremes tended towards a permanent\r\nsettlement, since moderation both gains and keeps adherents. Its aims\r\nwere practical as well as moderate; the language in which they were\r\nframed, clear and straightforward. A high authority has described the\r\nCharter as “an intensely practical document.”[220] This _practicality_\r\nis an essentially English characteristic, and strikes the key-note of\r\nalmost every great movement for reform which has held a permanent place\r\nin English history. Closely connected with this feature is another—the\r\nessentially _legal_ nature of the whole. As Magna Carta was rarely\r\nabsent from the minds of subsequent opponents of despotism, a practical\r\nand legal direction was thus given to the efforts of Englishmen in many\r\nages.[221] Therein lies another English characteristic. While democratic\r\nenthusiasts in France and America have often sought to found their\r\nrights and liberties on a lofty but unstable basis of philosophical\r\ntheory embodied in Declarations of Rights; Englishmen have occupied\r\nlower but surer ground, aiming at practical remedies for actual wrongs,\r\nrather than enunciating theoretical platitudes with no realities to\r\ncorrespond.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 220:\r\n\r\n  Prof. F. W. Maitland, _Social England_, I., 409.\r\n\r\nFootnote 221:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Gneist, _Const. Hist._, Chapter XVIII.: “By Magna Carta English\r\n  history irrevocably took the direction of securing constitutional\r\n  liberty by administrative law.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAnother intrinsic merit of the Charter was that it made definite what\r\nhad been vague before. Definition is a valuable protection for the weak\r\nagainst the strong; whereas vagueness increases the powers of the tyrant\r\nwho can interpret while he enforces the law. Misty rights were now\r\nreduced to a tangible form, and could no longer be broken with so great\r\nimpunity. Magna Carta contained no crude innovations, and confirmed many\r\nprinciples whose value was enhanced by their antiquity. King John, in\r\nrecognising parts of the old Anglo-Saxon customary law, put himself in\r\ntouch with national traditions and the past history of the nation.\r\n\r\nFurther, the nature of the provisions bears witness to the broad basis\r\non which the settlement was intended to be built. The Charter,\r\nnotwithstanding the prominence given to redress of feudal grievances,\r\nredressed other grievances as well. In this, the influence of the Church\r\nand notably of its Primate, can be traced. Some little attention was\r\ngiven to the rights of the under-tenants also, and even to those of the\r\nmerchants, while the villein and the alien were not left entirely\r\nunprotected. Thus the settlement contained in the Charter had a broad\r\nbasis in the affection of all classes.\r\n\r\n(2) Part of the value of Magna Carta may be traced to extrinsic causes;\r\nto the circumstances which gave it birth—to its vivid historical\r\nsetting. The importance of each one of its provisions is emphasized by\r\nthe object-lessons which accompanied its inauguration. The whole of\r\nChristendom was amazed by the spectacle of the King of a great nation\r\nobliged to surrender at discretion to his own subjects, and that, too,\r\nafter he had scornfully rejected all suggestions of a compromise. The\r\nfact that John was compelled to accept the Charter meant a loss of royal\r\nprestige, and also great encouragement to future rebels. What once had\r\nhappened, might happen again; and the humiliation of the King was\r\nstamped as a powerful image on the minds of future generations.\r\n\r\nSuch considerations almost justify enthusiasts, who hold that the\r\ngranting of Magna Carta was the turning-point in English history.\r\nHenceforward it was more difficult for the king to invade the rights of\r\nothers. Where previously the vagueness of the law lent itself to\r\nevasion, its clear re-statement and ratification in 1215 pinned down the\r\nking to a definite issue. He could no longer plead that he sinned in\r\nignorance; he must either keep the law, or openly defy it—no middle\r\ncourse was possible.\r\n\r\nWhen all this has been said, it may still be doubted whether the belief\r\nof enthusiasts in the excessive importance of Magna Carta has been fully\r\njustified. Many other triumphs, almost equally important, have been won\r\nin the cause of liberty, and under circumstances almost equally notable;\r\nand many statutes have been passed embodying these. Why then should\r\nMagna Carta be invariably extolled as the palladium of English\r\nliberties? Is not, when all is said, the extreme merit attributed to it\r\nmainly of a sentimental or imaginative nature? Such questions must be\r\nanswered partly in the affirmative. Much of its value _does_ depend on\r\nsentiment. Yet all government is, in a sense, founded upon\r\nsentiment—sometimes affection, sometimes fear. Psychological\r\nconsiderations are all-powerful in the practical affairs of life.\r\nIntangible and even unreal phenomena have played an important part in\r\nthe history of every nation. The tie that binds the British colonies at\r\nthe present day to the Mother Country is largely one of sentiment; yet\r\nthe troopers from Canada and New Zealand who responded to the call of\r\nBritain in her hour of need produced practical results of an obvious\r\nnature. The element of sentiment in politics can never be ignored.\r\n\r\nIt is no disparagement to Magna Carta, then, to confess that part of its\r\npower has been read into it by later generations, and lies in the halo,\r\nalmost of romance, which has gradually gathered round it in the course\r\nof centuries. It became a battle cry for future ages, a banner, a\r\nrallying point, a stimulus to the imagination. For a king, thereafter,\r\nopenly to infringe the promises contained in the Great Charter, was to\r\nchallenge the bitterness of public opinion—to put himself palpably in\r\nthe wrong. For an aggrieved man, however humble, to base his rights upon\r\nits terms was to enlist the warm sympathy of all. Time and again, from\r\nthe Barons’ War against Henry III. to the days of John Hampden and\r\nOliver Cromwell, the possibility of appealing to the words of Magna\r\nCarta has afforded a practical ground for opposition; an easily\r\nintelligible principle to fight for; a fortified position to hold\r\nagainst the enemies of the national freedom. The exact way in which this\r\nparticular document—dry as its details at first sight may seem—has, when\r\nconsidered as a whole, fired the popular imagination, is difficult to\r\ndetermine. Such a task lies rather within the sphere of the student of\r\npsychology than of the student of history, as usually conceived. However\r\ndifficult it may be to explain this phenomenon, there is no doubt of its\r\nexistence. The importance of the Great Charter, originally flowing both\r\nfrom the intrinsic and from the extrinsic features already described,\r\nhas greatly increased, as traditions, associations, and aspirations have\r\nclustered more thickly round it. These have augmented in each succeeding\r\nage the reverence in which it has been held, and have made ever more\r\nsecure its hold upon the popular imagination.\r\n\r\nThus Magna Carta, in addition to its legal value, has a political value\r\nof an equally emphatic kind. Apart from and beyond the salutary effect\r\nof the many useful laws it contained, its moral influence has\r\ncontributed to a marked advance of the national spirit, and therefore of\r\nthe national liberties. A few of the aspects of this advance deserve to\r\nbe emphasized. The King, by granting the Charter in solemn form,\r\nadmitted that he was not an absolute ruler—admitted that he had a master\r\nover him in the laws which he had often violated, but which he now swore\r\nto obey. Magna Carta has thus been truly said to enunciate and\r\ninaugurate “the reign of law” or “the rule of law” in the phrase made\r\nfamous by Professor Dicey.[222]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 222:\r\n\r\n  A. V. Dicey, _Law of the Constitution_, Part II.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt marks also the commencement of a new grouping of political forces in\r\nEngland; indeed without such a rearrangement the winning of the Charter\r\nwould have been impossible. Throughout the reign of Richard I. the old\r\ntacit understanding between the king and the lower classes had been\r\nendangered by the heavy drain of taxation; but the actual break-up of\r\nthe old alliance only came in the crisis of John’s reign. Henceforward\r\ncan be traced a gradual change in the balance of parties in the\r\ncommonwealth. No longer are Crown and people united, in the name of law\r\nand order, against the baronage, standing for feudal disintegration. The\r\nmass of humble freemen and the Church are for the moment in league with\r\nthe barons, in the name of law and order, against the Crown, recently\r\nbecome the chief law-breaker.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of the existence of such an alliance, even on a\r\ntemporary basis, involved the adoption by its chief members of a new\r\nbaronial policy. Hitherto each great baron had aimed at his own\r\nindependence or aggrandisement, striving on the one hand to gain new\r\nfranchises for himself, or to widen the scope of those he already had,\r\nand on the other to weaken the king and to keep him outside these\r\nfranchises. This policy, which succeeded both in France and in Scotland,\r\nhad before John’s reign already failed signally in England, and the\r\nEnglish barons now, on the whole, came to admit the hopelessness of\r\nrenewing the struggle for feudal independence. They substituted for this\r\nideal of an earlier age a more progressive policy. The king, whose\r\ninterference they could no longer hope completely to shake off, must at\r\nleast be taught to interfere justly and according to rule; he must walk\r\nonly by law and custom, not by the caprices of his evil heart. The\r\nbarons sought henceforward, to control the royal power they could not\r\nexclude; they desired some determining share in the national councils,\r\nif they could no longer hope to create little nations of their own\r\nwithin the four corners of their fiefs. Magna Carta was the fruit of\r\nthis new policy.\r\n\r\nIt has been often repeated, and with truth, that the Great Charter marks\r\nalso a stage in the growth of national unity or nationality. Here,\r\nhowever, it is necessary to guard against exaggeration. It is merely one\r\nmovement in a process, rather than a final achievement. We must somewhat\r\ndiscount, while still agreeing in the main with, statements which\r\ndeclare the Charter to be “the first documentary proof of the existence\r\nof a united English nation”; or with the often-quoted words of Dr.\r\nStubbs, that “The Great Charter is the first great public act of the\r\nnation, after it has realised its own identity.”[223]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 223:\r\n\r\n  _Const. Hist._, I. 571. Cf. _Ibid._, I. 583, “The act of the united\r\n  nation, the church, the barons, and the commons, for the first time\r\n  thoroughly at one.” Who were “the commons” in 1215? The question is a\r\n  difficult one to answer. Cf. also Mr. Prothero, _Simon de Montfort_,\r\n  18, “The spirit of nationality of which the chief portion of Magna\r\n  Carta was at once the product and the seal.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nA united English nation, whether conscious or unconscious of its\r\nidentity, cannot be said to have existed in 1215, except under several\r\nqualifications. The conception of “nationality,” in the modern sense, is\r\nof comparatively recent origin, and requires that the lower as well as\r\nthe higher classes should be comprehended within its bounds. Further,\r\nthe coalition which wrested the Charter from the royal tyrant was\r\nessentially of a temporary nature, and quickly fell to pieces again.\r\nEven while the alliance continued, the interests of the various classes,\r\nas has been already shown, were far from identical. Political rights\r\nwere treated as the monopoly of the few (as is evidenced by the\r\nretrograde provisions of chapter 14 for the composition of the _Commune\r\nconcilium_); and civil rights were far from universally distributed. The\r\nleaders of the “national” movement certainly gave no _political_ rights\r\nto the despised villeins, who comprised more than three quarters of the\r\nentire population of England; while their _civil_ rights were almost\r\ncompletely ignored in the provisions of the Charter.\r\n\r\nMagna Carta undoubtedly marked one step, an important step, in the\r\nprocess by which England became a nation; but that step was neither the\r\nfirst nor yet the final one.\r\n\r\nV. Magna Carta. Its defects.\r\n\r\nThe great weakness of the Charter lay in this, that no adequate sanction\r\nwas attached to it, in order to ensure the enforcement of its\r\nprovisions. The only expedient suggested for compelling the King to keep\r\nhis promises was of a nature at once clumsy and revolutionary, and\r\nentirely worthless considered as a working scheme of government. Indeed,\r\nit was devised not so much to prevent the King from breaking faith as to\r\npunish him when he had done so. In other words, no proper constitutional\r\nmachinery was invented to turn the legal theories of Magna Carta into\r\npractical realities. In its absence, we find what has sometimes been\r\ndescribed as “a right of legalized rebellion” conferred on an executive\r\ncommittee of twenty-five of the King’s enemies.\r\n\r\nThis is the chief defect, but not the only one. Many minor faults and\r\nomissions may be traced to a similar root. All the great constitutional\r\nprinciples are in reality conspicuously absent. The importance of a\r\ncouncil or embryo parliament, constituted on truly national lines (of\r\nwhich some glimmerings can be traced in 1213); the right of such a body\r\nto influence the King’s policy in normal times as well as in times of\r\ncrisis; the doctrine of ministerial responsibility (already dimly\r\nforeshadowed in the reign of Richard); the need of distinguishing the\r\nvarious functions of government, legislative, judicial, and\r\nadministrative—all these cardinal principles are completely ignored by\r\nthe Charter. Not one of its many clauses affords evidence that the\r\nstatesmen of the day had any conception, even of a rudimentary nature,\r\nof the principles of political science.\r\n\r\nOnly five of the sixty-three chapters can be said to bear directly on\r\nthe subject of constitutional (as opposed to purely legal) machinery,\r\nand most of these do so only incidentally, namely, chapters 14, 21, 39,\r\n61, and 62.\r\n\r\nThe _Commune Concilium_ is indeed mentioned; and its composition and\r\nmode of summons are clearly defined in chapter 14. But it must be\r\nremembered that this chapter appears as a mere afterthought,—as an\r\nappendix to chapter 12; its incidental nature is proved by the fact that\r\nit has no counterpart in the Articles of the Barons. The rebel magnates\r\nwere vitally interested in the narrow question of scutage, not in the\r\nwide possibilities involved in the existence of a national council. The\r\n_Commune Concilium_ was dragged into the Charter, not on its own merits,\r\nbut merely as a convenient method of preventing the arbitrary increase\r\nof feudal exactions. That this was so, is further proved by the fact\r\nthat both parties were content to omit all mention of the Council from\r\nthe re-issue of 1217, when an alternative way of checking the arbitrary\r\nincrease of scutage had been devised.\r\n\r\nIf the framers of John’s Magna Carta had possessed any grasp of\r\nconstitutional principles, they would gladly have seized the opportunity\r\nafforded them by the mention, however incidentally, of the Common\r\nCouncil, in chapters 12 and 14, in order to define most carefully the\r\npowers which they claimed for it. On the contrary, no list of its\r\nfunctions is drawn up; nor do the words of the Charter contain anything\r\nto suggest that it exercised any powers other than that of consenting to\r\nscutages and aids. Not a word is said of any right inherent in the\r\nCouncil to a share in legislation, to control or even to advise the\r\nExecutive, or to concur in choosing the great ministers of the Crown.\r\nNeither deliberative, administrative, nor legislative powers are secured\r\nto it, while its control over taxation is strictly limited to the right\r\nto veto scutages and aids—that is say, it only extends over that very\r\nnarrow class of exactions which affected the military tenants of the\r\nCrown. It is true that chapters 21 and 39 may possibly be read\r\nconfirming the _judicial_ power of the Council in a certain limited\r\ngroup of cases. Earls and barons are not to be amerced except by their\r\npeers (_per pares suos_), and the natural place for these “equals” of a\r\nCrown vassal to assemble for this purpose would be the _Commune\r\nConcilium_. This, however, is merely matter of inference; chapter 21\r\nmakes no mention of the Council; and it is equally possible that its\r\nrequirements would be met by the presence among the officials of the\r\nExchequer of a few Crown tenants.[224] Similar reasoning applies to the\r\nprovisions of chapter 39 (protecting the persons and property of\r\nfreemen, by insisting on the necessity of a “trial by peers”) so far as\r\nthey affect earls and barons.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 224:\r\n\r\n  This is the view of Mr. L. O. Pike, _House of Lords_, 204.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the leaders of the opposition in 1215 did not consider\r\nthe constitutional powers of a national Parliament the best safeguard of\r\nthe rights and liberties theoretically guaranteed by the Charter. Only\r\none practical or constitutional expedient seems to have occurred to\r\nthem, namely, that embodied in chapter 61. Twenty-five barons were to be\r\nappointed by their fellow-barons to act as Executors of the Charter; but\r\ntheir functions were apparently only to be called into play in the event\r\nof King John or his officers breaking any of the provisions of the\r\nCharter. If this occurred, intimation might be made to a smaller\r\nsub-committee of four, chosen from the twenty-five, and these four would\r\nstraightway ask the King to redress the grievance complained of. If this\r\nwas not done within forty days, John granted to the Committee of\r\ntwenty-five, assisted by “the whole community of the realm,” the right\r\npractically to make war upon him. He conferred on them in the most\r\nexplicit terms full power “to distrain and distress us in all possible\r\nways, by seizing our castles, lands, possessions, and in any other way\r\nthey can, until the grievances are redressed according to their\r\npleasure.”\r\n\r\nSuch a provision can hardly be described as constitutional, since it is\r\nrather the negation of all constitutional principles—nothing more nor\r\nless than legalized rebellion. Provision is made not for the orderly\r\nconduct of government, but rather to provide an organization for making\r\nwar upon the king in certain abnormal circumstances which are defined.\r\nSuch a scheme was clearly impracticable, and the fact that it\r\nrecommended itself as a possible expedient to the barons speaks\r\neloquently of their complete ignorance of the most elementary principles\r\nof the science of government. Civil war levied on a warrant granted\r\nbeforehand by the king is treated as a constitutional expedient for the\r\nredress of particular grievances as they arise.[225]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 225:\r\n\r\n  Details of this scheme, and a fuller discussion of its defects will be\r\n  found _infra_ under chapter 61.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe same inability to devise practical remedies for specific evils may\r\nbe traced in several minor clauses of the Charter.[226] When John\r\npromised in chapter 16 that no one should be compelled to do greater\r\nservice than had been formerly due from any holding, no attempt was\r\nmade, in case of dispute, to provide constitutional machinery to define\r\nwhat such service actually was; while chapter 45, providing that only\r\nmen who knew the law, and meant to keep it, should be made justiciars,\r\nsheriffs or bailiffs, laid down no criterion of fitness, and contained\r\nno suggestion of any way in which so laudable an ambition might be\r\nrealized.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 226:\r\n\r\n  Magna Carta has been described, in words already quoted with approval,\r\n  as “an intensely practical document,” Professor Maitland, _Social\r\n  England_, I. 409; but this requires some qualification. If it was\r\n  practical in preferring the condemnation of definite practical\r\n  grievances to the enunciation of philosophical principles, it was\r\n  unpractical in omitting to provide machinery for giving effect to its\r\n  provisions.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThoughtful and statesmanlike as were the provisions of Magna Carta, and\r\nwide as was the ground they covered, many important omissions can be\r\npointed out. Some crucial questions seem not to have been foreseen, and\r\nothers, for example the liability to foreign service, were deliberately\r\nshelved[227]—thus leaving room for future misunderstandings. The praise,\r\njustly earned, by its framers for the care and precision with which they\r\ndefined a long list of the more crying abuses, must be qualified in view\r\nof the failure to provide procedure to prevent their recurrence. Men had\r\nnot yet learned the force of the maxim, so closely identified with all\r\nlater reform movements in England, that a right is valueless without an\r\nappropriate remedy to enforce it.[228]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 227:\r\n\r\n  Except in so far as affected by cc. 12 and 16.\r\n\r\nFootnote 228:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Prothero estimates much more highly the constitutional value of\r\n  Magna Carta: \"The constitutional struggles of the following\r\n  half-century would to a great extent have been anticipated had it\r\n  retained its original form.\"—_Simon de Montfort_, 14.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n         VI. Magna Carta: Value of Traditional Interpretations.\r\n\r\nThe Great Charter has formed a favourite theme for orators and\r\npoliticians in all periods of English history, partly because of its\r\nintrinsic merit, partly because of the dramatic background of its\r\nhistorical setting, but chiefly because it has been, from the time of\r\nits inception down to the present day, a rallying cry and a protecting\r\nbulwark in every crisis which threatened to endanger the national\r\nliberties.\r\n\r\nThe uses to which it has been put, and the interpretations which have\r\nbeen read into it, are so numerous and so varied, that they would\r\nrequire a separate treatise to do them justice. Not only was Magna\r\nCarta, as will be shown in some detail in a later section, frequently\r\nreissued and confirmed, but its provisions have been asserted and\r\nre-asserted time after time, in Parliament, in the courts of justice,\r\nand in institutional works on jurisprudence. Its influence has thus been\r\nthreefold; and any attempt to explain its bearing on the subsequent\r\nhistory of English liberties would require to distinguish between these\r\nthree separate and equally important aspects. (1) It has supplied a\r\npowerful instrument in the hands of politicians, especially of the\r\nleaders of the House of Commons in the seventeenth century, when waging\r\nthe battle of constitutional freedom against the Stewart dynasty. (2)\r\nIts legal aspect has been as important as its political one, since it\r\nhas been cited in innumerable litigations before the various courts of\r\nlaw. In the course of legal debate and of judicial opinions, it has been\r\nthe subject of many and conflicting interpretations, some of them\r\naccurate and some erroneous. (3) Finally, it has been discussed in many\r\ncommentaries either exclusively devoted to its elucidation or else\r\ntreating of it incidentally in the course of general expositions of the\r\nlaw of England.\r\n\r\nAn exhaustive search throughout the seven centuries which separate us\r\nfrom 1215 for instances in which Magna Carta has appeared in the arena\r\nof politics, on the judicial bench, or in legal treatises would prove a\r\ngigantic task, but could hardly fail to illustrate the inestimable\r\nservices it has rendered to English liberties.\r\n\r\nIn the light of the important part which Magna Carta has thus played\r\nthroughout many centuries of English history, it need not excite wonder\r\nthat the estimation in which it was held, high as that was from a very\r\nearly period, has gradually increased, until it has overstepped all due\r\nbounds, and has become utterly exaggerated and distorted. While some\r\nsympathy may be felt for such extravagant admiration, not unnatural in\r\nthe circumstances, it is clearly the duty of the commentator to correct\r\nfalse impressions. It is well to point out that no document of human\r\norigin can be really worthy of the excessive eulogy of which the Great\r\nCharter has been made the subject; unfortunately, it has more frequently\r\nbeen described in terms of inflated rhetoric than of sober methodical\r\nanalysis.[229]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 229:\r\n\r\n  Extravagant estimates of its value will readily occur to anyone\r\n  acquainted with the literature of the subject. For example, Sir James\r\n  Mackintosh (_History of England_, I. 218, edn. of 1853) declares that\r\n  we are “bound to speak with reverential gratitude of the authors of\r\n  the Great Charter. To have produced it, to have preserved it, to have\r\n  matured it, constitute the immortal claim of England upon the esteem\r\n  of mankind. Her Bacons and Shakespeares, her Miltons and Newtons,\r\n  etc., etc.” Such uncritical eulogy contributes nothing to the\r\n  understanding of Magna Carta.\r\n\r\nNor has this tendency to unthinking adulation been entirely confined to\r\npopular writers; judges and institutional authors, even Sir Edward Coke\r\nhimself, have too often lost the faculty of critical and exact\r\nscholarship when confronted with the virtues of the Great Charter. There\r\nis scarcely one great principle of the English constitution of the\r\npresent day, or indeed of any constitution in any day, calculated to\r\nsecure national liberties, or otherwise to win the esteem of mankind,\r\nwhich has not been read by commentators into the provisions of Magna\r\nCarta. In particular, the political leaders of the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries discovered among its chapters every important\r\nreform which they desired to introduce into England, thereby disguising\r\nthe revolutionary nature of many of their projects by dressing them in\r\nthe garb of the past.\r\n\r\nMany instances of the constitutional principles and institutions, with\r\nthe origin of which successive commentators have erroneously credited\r\nthe Great Charter, will be expounded under the appropriate chapters of\r\nthe sequel. It will be sufficient in the meantime to enumerate trial by\r\njury; the right of every prisoner to obtain a writ of Habeas Corpus; the\r\nabolition of all arbitrary imprisonment at the king’s command; the\r\ncomplete prohibition of monopolies; the enunciation of a close and\r\nindissoluble tie between taxation and representation; equality of all\r\nand sundry before the law; a matured conception of nationality,\r\nembracing high and low, freeman and villein alike: all these, and more,\r\nhave been discovered in various clauses of the Great Charter.[230]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 230:\r\n\r\n  Edmund Burke (_Works_, II. 53, edn. of 1837, Boston) credits Magna\r\n  Carta with creating the House of Commons! “Magna Charta, if it did not\r\n  give us originally the House of Commons, gave us at least a House of\r\n  Commons of weight and consequence.” As will be shown in the sequel,\r\n  chapter 14 of the Great Charter (the only one bearing on the subject)\r\n  is in reality of a reactionary nature, confining the right of\r\n  attendance at the _commune concilium_ to the freeholders of the Crown\r\n  and departing from the precedent of two years earlier, which\r\n  introduced representatives of each county.\r\n\r\nIf these tendencies to excessive and sometimes ignorant praise have been\r\nunfortunate from one point of view, they have been most fortunate from\r\nanother. The legal and political aspects must be sharply contrasted. On\r\nthe one hand, the vague and inaccurate words used in speaking of the\r\nCharter even by great lawyers, such as Coke (not necessarily equally\r\ngreat as historians, living as they did in an age when the science of\r\nhistory was unknown), have not only obscured the bearing of many\r\nchapters, but have done a distinct injury to the study of the\r\ndevelopment of English law. On the other hand, as the mistakes made in\r\ncommenting on the Charter have been almost entirely due to a laudable\r\ndesire to extend as widely as possible its provisions in favour of\r\nindividual and national liberties, and to magnify generally its\r\nimportance; the service these very errors have done to the cause of\r\nconstitutional progress is measureless. If political bias has coloured\r\nthe interpretation placed on many of the most famous clauses, the\r\nensuing benefit has accrued not to any one narrow party or faction, not\r\nto any separate class or interest, but rather to the entire body politic\r\nand to the cause of national progress in its widest and best\r\ndevelopments.\r\n\r\nThus the historian of Magna Carta, while bound to correct estimates now\r\nseen to be erroneous in the light of modern research, cannot afford to\r\ndespise or under-estimate the value of traditional interpretations. The\r\nmeanings which have been read into it by the learned men of later ages,\r\nand which have been acquiesced in by public opinion of the day, have had\r\nan equally potent effect whether they were historically well founded or\r\nill founded. The stigma of being banned by the Great Charter was usually\r\ntoo great a burden for any institution or line of policy to bear. If the\r\nbelief prevailed that an abuse complained of was really prohibited by\r\nMagna Carta, the most arbitrary king had difficulty in finding judges\r\nwho would declare it legal, or trustworthy ministers who would persevere\r\nin enforcing it. The prevalence of such a belief was the main point;\r\nwhether it was well or ill founded was, for political purposes, quite\r\nimmaterial. The greatness of Magna Carta lies not so much in what it was\r\nto its framers in 1215, as in what it afterwards became to the political\r\nleaders, to the judges and lawyers, and to the entire mass of the men of\r\nEngland in later ages.\r\n\r\n      VII. Magna Carta. Its traditional relation to Trial by Jury.\r\n\r\nOne persistent error, universally adopted for many centuries, and even\r\nnow hard to dispel, is that the Great Charter granted or guaranteed\r\ntrial by jury.[231] This belief, however, which has endured so long and\r\nplayed so prominent a part in political theory, is now held by all\r\ncompetent authorities to be entirely unfounded. Not one of the three\r\nforms of a modern jury trial had taken definite shape in 1215, although\r\nthe root principle from which all three subsequently grew had been in\r\nconstant use since the Norman Conquest. Henry II., indeed, had done much\r\ntowards developing existing tendencies in the direction of all three of\r\nits forms, namely, of the grand jury, the petty criminal jury, and the\r\njury of civil pleas.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 231:\r\n\r\n  The source of this error was the identification of the _judicium\r\n  parium_ of chapter 39 with jury trial. This mistake is fully refuted\r\n  _infra_ under that chapter.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMagna Carta, embodying as it does many of the innovations of Henry of\r\nAnjou, necessarily contains indications of the existence of these\r\ntendencies. Yet, as these occur incidentally in various provisions of\r\nunconnected chapters, and as they cannot readily be recognized, on\r\naccount of the technical language in which they are usually couched and\r\nthe apparently trivial points of legal procedure to which they relate,\r\nit seems well to preface the separate consideration of each of them\r\nunder its appropriate chapter, by a short account of their mutual\r\nrelations. This will conduce to a clear understanding alike of trial by\r\njury and of the Great Charter itself.\r\n\r\nJury trial in each of the three forms in which it is known to modern\r\nEnglish law is able to trace an unbroken pedigree (though by three\r\ndistinct lines of descent) from the same ancestor, namely, from that\r\nprinciple known as _recognitio_ or _inquisitio_, which was introduced\r\ninto England by the Normans, and was simply the practice whereby the\r\nCrown obtained information on local affairs from the sworn testimony of\r\nlocal men. While thus postulating a foreign origin for this “palladium\r\nof English liberties,” we are afforded consolation by the remembrance of\r\na fact which some modern authorities are too much inclined to neglect,\r\nnamely, that the soil was prepared by Anglo-Saxon labour for its\r\nplanting.[232]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 232:\r\n\r\n  The theory now generally accepted that the origin of trial by jury\r\n  must be sought in procedure introduced by the Norman Dukes and not in\r\n  any form of popular Anglo-Saxon institutions is ably maintained by\r\n  Pollock and Maitland, I. 119, and by the late Professor J. B. Thayer,\r\n  _Evidence_, p. 7. Undoubtedly their conclusions are in the main\r\n  correct; but in their natural desire to remove misconceptions, they\r\n  are possibly guilty of some slight exaggeration. Trial by jury may\r\n  have had more than one root, and a full appreciation of the value of\r\n  the Norman contribution need not lead to the total neglect of the\r\n  Anglo-Saxon one. Accepted conclusions in this respect might profitably\r\n  be supplemented by the opinions of Dr. Hannis Taylor, _English\r\n  Constitution_, I. 308 and I. 323.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe old English institution of the frithborh—the practice of binding\r\ntogether little groups of neighbours for preservation of the peace—and\r\nthe custom of sending representatives of the villages to the Hundred\r\nCourts, had alike accustomed the natives to corporate action and formed\r\nin some sort precedents for what their Norman masters compelled them to\r\ndo, namely, to give their evidence on local matters jointly and on oath.\r\nFurther, one form of the jury—the jury of accusation—is clearly\r\nforeshadowed (in spite of the complete breach of continuity in the\r\nintervening period) by the directions given to the twelve senior thegns\r\nof each Wapentake by a well-known law of Ethelred. Yet the credit of\r\nestablishing the jury system as a fundamental institution in England is\r\nundoubtedly due to the Norman and Angevin kings, although they acted in\r\ntheir own interests and not in those of their oppressed subjects, and\r\nalthough they had no clear vision of the ultimate consequences of what\r\nthey did. The uses to which the _Inquisitio_ was put by William and his\r\nsons in framing _Domesday Book_, collecting information about existing\r\nlaws, and dispensing justice, have already been discussed.[233]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 233:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, pp. 105-6.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt was reserved for Henry II. to start the institution on a further\r\ncareer of development; he it was who thus laid the foundations of the\r\nmodern jury system. Strangely enough, he did this not merely in one of\r\nits forms, but in all three of them.\r\n\r\n(1) In re-organizing machinery for the suppression and punishment of\r\ncrime by the Assizes of Clarendon and Northampton, he established the\r\ngeneral principle that criminal trials should (in the normal case) begin\r\nwith formal indictment of the accused by a representative body of\r\nneighbours sworn to speak the truth.[234] This was merely a systematic\r\nenforcement of one of the many forms of _inquisitio_ already in use;\r\nfrom that date onwards the practice so established has been followed in\r\nEngland. Criminal prosecution cannot be begun on mere suspicion or\r\nirresponsible complaints. The jury of accusation (or presentment) may be\r\nsaid to have been instituted in 1166, and has continued in use ever\r\nsince, passing by an unbroken course of development into the grand jury\r\nof the present day.[235]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 234:\r\n\r\n  See Pollock and Maitland, I. 131. It was part of Henry’s policy to\r\n  substitute indictment by a representative jury for the older appeal by\r\n  the wronged individual or his surviving relatives. The older\r\n  procedure, however, was not completely abolished though looked upon\r\n  with disfavour. Its continuance and also its unpopularity may both be\r\n  traced in chapter 54 of Magna Carta. See _infra_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 235:\r\n\r\n  Chapter 38 of Magna Carta, according to a plausible interpretation of\r\n  an admittedly obscure passage, seems to insist on the necessity of\r\n  such an accusation by the jury:—“_non ... sine testibus fidelibus ad\r\n  hoc inductis_.”\r\n\r\n(2) By insisting that the ordeal was the only adequate test of an\r\naccused man’s guilt or innocence, Henry unconsciously prepared the way\r\nfor a second form of jury. When the fourth Lateran Council in the very\r\nyear of Magna Carta forbade priests to countenance ordeal by their\r\npresence or blessing, a death-blow was really dealt to that form of\r\nprocedure or “test,” since it depended for its authority on\r\nsuperstition. A canon of the Church had thus suddenly struck away the\r\npivot on which Henry had made his entire criminal system to revolve.\r\nSome substitute required urgently to be devised. It was to supply this\r\nthat the petty jury (or its rude antecedent) came into existence. The\r\nman who had been publicly accused as _presumably_ guilty by the voice of\r\nhis neighbours, was asked if he was willing to stand or fall by a\r\nfurther and final reference to the oath of a second jury of neighbours.\r\nThis second verdict, then, was the new “test” or “law” substituted, if\r\nthe accused man agreed, for his old right of proving himself innocent by\r\nthe ordeal. By obscure steps, on which those best entitled to speak with\r\nauthority are not yet agreed, this jury, giving a second and final\r\nverdict, gradually developed into the criminal jury of twelve, the petty\r\njury of to-day, the characteristics of which are well known and which\r\nhas had so important an influence on the development of constitutional\r\nliberties in England, and even, it is said, on the national character.\r\n\r\nAnother expedient of Henry’s invention must have aided the movement in\r\nthe direction of the criminal jury, namely, the writ _de odio et atia_\r\nby applying for which a man “appealed” or accused of a crime might\r\nsubstitute what was practically a jury’s verdict for the “battle” which\r\nhad previously, in the normal case, followed “appeal” as a matter of\r\ncourse.[236]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 236:\r\n\r\n  For fuller details see _infra_ under chapter 36, and _supra_ p. 108.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(3) The Civil Jury owes its origin to quite a different set of reforms,\r\nthough inaugurated by the same reformer. Among the evil legacies left to\r\nHenry II. from Stephen’s reign, not the least troublesome were the\r\nnumerous claims advanced by rival magnates to the various estates and\r\nfranchises which had been bestowed with equally lavish hands, but on\r\ndifferent persons, by Matilda and Stephen. Henry realized the urgent\r\nneed of giving his realm rest by protecting vested interests and by\r\nintroducing a more rational expedient than trial by combat for deciding\r\nbetween rival claimants to landed estates. Here again he had recourse to\r\na new development of “inquisition.” In such cases an option was given to\r\nthe defendant (the man in possession, the man with a vested interest\r\nwhich deserved protection), to refer the question at issue to the\r\nverdict of local recognitors, twelve knights or freeholders in this\r\ncase, and therefore men of some position. The name “Assize” was, for\r\nreasons to be immediately explained, applied alike to the procedure\r\nitself and to the twelve neighbours who gave the verdict.\r\n\r\nThis new expedient, perhaps because it was looked on with suspicion as\r\nan innovation of a violent and revolutionary nature, was applied at\r\nfirst only to a few special cases, namely, to certain disputes as to\r\nvested interests in land. It was used to settle claims of ultimate\r\ntitle—the out-and-out ownership of the land—and then it was known as the\r\nGrand Assize; it was also used to settle a few well-defined groups of\r\npleas of disputed possession, and then it was known as a Petty Assize\r\n(of which there were, however, three distinct and well-known\r\nvarieties).[237]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 237:\r\n\r\n  These three Petty Assizes are mentioned by name in c. 18 of the Great\r\n  Charter, and under that heading the entire subject is more fully\r\n  discussed. See _infra_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn these cases, the defendant could escape “battle” and compel the\r\nplaintiff, even against his will, to submit his claim to the verdict of\r\nthe recognitors. This new-fangled privilege of the defendant had no\r\nbasis in the ancient custom of the land, but depended solely on royal\r\nprerogative. The king, by a high-handed act of power, thus favoured the\r\ndefendant, by depriving the claimant of that remedy which was his right\r\nby feudal law, namely, the resort to the legal duel. It was because the\r\nnew procedure was thus founded on a royal Ordinance, that the name\r\n“Assize” was applied to it. The _assisa_ was a remedy strictly confined\r\nto four groups of pleas.\r\n\r\nBy consent of _both_ parties, however, disputes of almost every\r\ndescription might be similarly determined; being referred (under\r\nsupervision of the king’s judges) to the verdict of local recognitors,\r\nusually twelve in number, who were then known as a _jurata_ (not an\r\n_assisa_, the two being strictly opposed to each other). While the\r\n_assisa_ was narrowly confined to a few types of cases, the _jurata_,\r\nsince it favoured neither party, was a flexible remedy capable of\r\nindefinite expansion, and thus soon became the more popular and the more\r\nimportant of the two. Yet the ancient _assisa_ and the ancient _jurata_,\r\nalways closely connected, and resembling each other in most essential\r\nfeatures, can both claim to be ancestors of the modern civil \"jury,\"—the\r\nname of the more popular institution having survived. Magna Carta, in\r\nproviding for the frequent holding of the three Petty Assizes, marked a\r\nstage in the development of the Civil Jury; while, in enforcing the\r\ncriminal procedure of Henry Plantagenet, and guarding it from abuse, the\r\nCharter had also a vital bearing on the genesis of the Grand Jury and\r\nthe Petty Jury alike.\r\n\r\nThese scattered and incidental references to tendencies still vague and\r\nindefinite must not, however, be misread as a reference to the definite\r\nprocedure into which at a later date they coalesced: Magna Carta does\r\nnot promise “trial by jury” to anyone.\r\n\r\n                                PART IV.\r\n                   HISTORICAL SEQUEL TO MAGNA CARTA.\r\n\r\n          I. Re-issues and Confirmations of the Great Charter.\r\n\r\nWhile King John had accepted the reforms contained in Magna Carta\r\nunwillingly and insincerely, the advisers of his son accepted them in\r\ngood faith. Three re-issues of the Charter were granted in 1216, in\r\n1217, and in 1225, and these were followed by many confirmations, a full\r\naccount of which would involve a complete political and legal history of\r\nEngland. The scheme of this Historical Introduction is restricted to the\r\nnarration of such facts as have a direct bearing on the genesis and\r\ncontents of the Charter of John. Yet no account of Magna Carta would be\r\ncomplete without some notice of the more important alterations contained\r\nin these three re-issues.\r\n\r\nOn 28th October, 1216, Henry of Winchester, was crowned at Gloucester\r\nbefore a small assemblage.[238] The young King took the usual oath as\r\ndirected by the Bishop of Bath, and he also performed homage to the\r\nPope’s representative Gualo, for the King of England was now the vassal\r\nof Rome. At a Council held at Bristol, on 11th November, William\r\nMarshal, Earl of Pembroke, was appointed _Rector regis et regni_; and,\r\nnext day, the Charter was re-issued in the King’s name. This was a step\r\nof extreme importance, marking the acceptance by those in power for the\r\ntime being of the programme of the baronial opposition.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 238:\r\n\r\n  See _Annals of Waverley_, p. 286, and Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, II. 18.\r\n\r\nThe Charter in its new form was really a manifesto issued by the\r\nmoderate men who rallied round the throne of the young King; it may be\r\nviewed in two aspects, as a declaration by the Regent and his\r\nco-adjutors of the policy on which they accepted office, and as a bid\r\nfor the support of the barons who still adhered to the faction of the\r\nFrench prince. Its issue was, indeed, dictated by the crucial situation\r\ncreated by the presence in England of Prince Louis of France supported\r\nby a foreign army and by a large faction of the English barons who had\r\nsworn homage to him as their king. It was, therefore, framed in terms\r\nlikely to conciliate such of the opposition as were still open to\r\nconciliation. Yet the new Charter could not be a verbatim re-issue of\r\nthe old one. Vital alterations were required by the altered\r\ncircumstances.[239] It was no longer the expression of a reluctant\r\nconsent by the government of the day to the demands of its enemies, but\r\nrather a set of rules deliberately accepted by that government for its\r\nown guidance. The chief tyrant against whom the original provisions had\r\nbeen directed was now dead, and certain forms of tyranny, it was\r\nconfidently hoped, had died with him. Restraints now placed on the\r\nCrown’s prerogatives would only hamper the free action of the men who\r\nframed them, not of their political opponents. The new beneficent\r\ngovernment must not suffer for the sins of the old evil one. The Regent,\r\nwhile willing to do much for the cause of conciliation, could not afford\r\nto paralyze his own efficiency at a time when foreign invaders were in\r\npossession of one-half of England, from which it would require a supreme\r\neffort to dislodge them. In especial, the Crown, in its urgent need for\r\nmoney wherewith to pay the wages of its mercenaries, must suffer no\r\nunnecessary restraints upon its powers of taxation. The existing civil\r\nwar made it imperative that the government should retain a free hand in\r\nexacting feudal services and in levying scutages. Moderate-minded men\r\nwould readily acquiesce in the wisdom of this policy; while it was\r\nuseless to modify it in the hope of conciliating the extreme party who\r\nhad thrown in their lot irretrievably with Prince Louis.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 239:\r\n\r\n  The cause for wonder is rather how few changes required to be made.\r\n  “It is, however, by no means the least curious feature of the history,\r\n  that so few changes were needed to transform a treaty won at the point\r\n  of the sword into a manifesto of peace and sound government.” Stubbs,\r\n  _Const. Hist._, II. 21.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Charter of 1216 is, therefore, notable for its omissions. The chief\r\namong these may be arranged under five groups.[240] (1) Restraints\r\nplaced in 1215 on the taxing power of the Crown now disappeared. The\r\nchapters which forbade the king to increase the “farms” or fixed rents\r\nof the counties and hundreds, those which defined the king’s relations\r\nwith the Jews, and those which restricted the lucrative rights derived\r\nfrom the rigorous enforcement of the forest laws, were discarded. An\r\neven more important omission was that of the clause which abolished the\r\nCrown’s rights to increase feudal contributions arbitrarily without\r\nconsent of the Common Council.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 240:\r\n\r\n  This classification takes no account of such alterations as seem to be\r\n  merely verbal or inserted to remove ambiguities, _e.g._ upon chapters\r\n  22, 28, and 30 of the original Charter.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(2) One clause specially valued by the national Church was also omitted.\r\nJohn’s grant of liberty of election by the canons of the chapters was\r\nquietly ignored; although the vague declaration that the Church “should\r\nbe free” was allowed to remain.\r\n\r\n(3) A great number of provisions of purely temporary interest naturally\r\ndisappeared, among them those providing for the disbandment of mercenary\r\ntroops and the dismissal from office of obnoxious individuals. Of more\r\nimportance was the omission of all reference to the device adopted for\r\nenforcing the original Charter by means of the baronial committee of\r\ntwenty-five Executors.\r\n\r\n(4) A number of minor omissions of a miscellaneous nature may be grouped\r\ntogether; for example, chapter 27, providing that the chattels of every\r\nfreeman who died intestate should be divided under the supervision of\r\nthe Church; chapter 41, granting freedom to leave the kingdom, and\r\nreturn, without the king’s consent; chapter 45, by which the Crown\r\nrestricted itself in the choice of justiciars and other officers; and\r\nthe latter half of chapter 47, relating to the banks of rivers and their\r\nguardians.[241]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 241:\r\n\r\n  These alterations show traces of some influence at work hostile to the\r\n  national Church. Not only is the promise of canonical election\r\n  withdrawn, but the omissions of the clauses regulating intestate\r\n  succession and guaranteeing freedom to leave the kingdom (a privilege\r\n  highly valued by the clergy) seem to prejudice the interests of\r\n  English churchmen. Now the papal legate was an active supporter of the\r\n  re-issue of this Charter in 1216; whereas Rome, in the crisis of June,\r\n  1215, had been bitterly opposed to the original grant of Magna Carta.\r\n  The inference is that Rome did not protest against these omissions to\r\n  the prejudice of the English Church. Why was this? The explanation\r\n  probably lies in the divergence of the interests of the national\r\n  Church from those of the Church universal. Canonical election, for\r\n  example, was nothing to Rome; successive Popes made provision for\r\n  their favourites more readily in England by bringing pressure to bear\r\n  on the King than on the monks of the various chapters. Henry III.\r\n  habitually acted on the omission; creating wide-felt discontent by\r\n  filling the English sees partly with his own foreign favourites, and\r\n  partly with ecclesiastics nominated by the Roman Curia. The King and\r\n  the Pope thus entered into a tacit partnership for their mutual\r\n  benefit at the expense of the English national Church.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(5) These various alterations implied, incidentally rather than\r\ndeliberately, the omission of all mention of such constitutional\r\nmachinery as had found a place in the words of John’s Great Charter. The\r\ntwenty-five Executors fell with the other temporary provisions; while\r\nchapter 14, which defined the composition and mode of summons of the\r\n_Commune Concilium_, was omitted as a matter of course, along with\r\nchapter 12, to which it had merely formed a supplement. It was\r\napparently thought unnecessary to make any mention of the Council, and\r\nthis attitude may be explained partly on the ground that the framers of\r\nthe new deed took for granted its continued existence in the future as\r\nin the past, and partly by the consideration that its vital importance\r\nas a constitutional safeguard had not yet been realized. Chapter 14 of\r\n1215, to which much importance is invariably attached by modern writers,\r\nprobably held quite a subordinate place in the minds of its framers and\r\nwas abandoned altogether in 1216, never to be replaced.[242]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 242:\r\n\r\n  It is notable that it failed to find a place in the Charter of 1225,\r\n  which was paid for by the nation at the price of one-fifteenth of\r\n  moveables.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHowever natural may be the explanation, the fact is no less notable that\r\nthe only clauses of the original Charter which partook of a\r\nconstitutional character entirely disappeared from all of its re-issues.\r\nMagna Carta as granted by Henry is purely concerned with matters which\r\nlie within the sphere of private law, and contains no attempt to devise\r\nmachinery of government or to construct constitutional safeguards for\r\nthe protection of national liberties. The circumstances of the King’s\r\nminority, perhaps, implied a constitutional check on the monarchy in the\r\nnecessary existence of guardians, but when Henry III. attained majority,\r\nMagna Carta, deprived of its original sanctions, would, with the\r\ndisappearance of the Regency, tend to become an empty record of royal\r\npromises. The entire machinery of government remained exclusively\r\nmonarchic; the king, once out of leading-strings, would be restrained\r\nonly by his own sense of honour and by the fear of armed resistance—by\r\nmoral forces neither legal nor constitutional. The logical outcome,\r\nunder the ripening process of time, was the Barons’ War.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the omissions is considerably minimized, however, by\r\ntwo considerations. (_a_) Many of the original provisions were merely\r\ndeclaratory, and their omission in 1216 by no means implied that they\r\nwere then abolished. The common law remained what it had been\r\npreviously, although it was not considered necessary to specify those\r\nparticular parts of it in black and white. In particular, throughout the\r\nentire reign of Henry, the _Commune Concilium_ frequently met, and was\r\nalways, in practice, consulted before a levy was made of any scutage or\r\naid. (_b_) It is clearly stated in the new charter that the advisability\r\nof replacing these omitted clauses was reserved for further\r\nconsideration at some more opportune occasion. In the so-called\r\n“respiting clause” (chapter 42) six topics were specially named as thus\r\nreserved because of their “grave and doubtful” import: the levying of\r\nscutages and aids, the debts of the Jews, the liberty of going from and\r\nreturning to England, the forest laws, the “farms” of counties, and the\r\ncustoms relating to banks of rivers and their guardians. This respiting\r\nclause amounts to a definite engagement by the King to take into serious\r\nconsideration at some future time (probably as soon as peace had been\r\nrestored) how far it would be possible to re-insert the omitted\r\nprovisions in a new charter. This promise was partially fulfilled a year\r\nlater.[243]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 243:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Stubbs propounds the theory that this re-issue of 1216 represents\r\n  a compromise whereby the central government, in return for increased\r\n  taxing powers, allowed to the feudal magnates increased rights of\r\n  jurisdiction. He gives, however, no reasons for this belief, either in\r\n  _Select Charters_, p. 339, or in his _Constitutional History_, II. 27.\r\n  It is abundantly clear that the Crown reserved a free hand for itself\r\n  in taxation, but there seems no evidence to support the other part of\r\n  the theory, namely, that feudal justice gained new ground against\r\n  royal justice in 1216 which had not been already gained in 1215.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nA practical difficulty confronted the advisers of the young King as to\r\nthe execution of the Charter. No instance of a Regency had occurred\r\nsince seals came into general use; and, therefore, neither law nor\r\ncustom afforded precedents for the execution of documents during a\r\nking’s minority. The seal of a king, like that of any ordinary magnate,\r\nwas personal to him, and not available for his heir. The custom indeed\r\nwas to destroy the matrix when a death occurred, and thus to prevent its\r\nbeing put to improper uses. John’s great seal could no longer be\r\nused,[244] and the advisers of Henry III. shrank from the responsibility\r\nof making a new one for the infant monarch. Yet no charter would be\r\nbinding unless executed with all the recognized formalities. In these\r\ncircumstances it was resolved to authenticate the new Charter by\r\nimpressing on it the seals of the papal legate and of the Regent. Henry\r\nwas made to explain that, in the absence of a seal of his own, the\r\nCharter had been sealed with the seals of Cardinal Gualo and of William\r\nMarshal, Earl of Pembroke, “_rectoris nostri et regni nostri_.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 244:\r\n\r\n  It is unnecessary to invent any special catastrophe to account for the\r\n  disappearance of John’s seal. Blackstone (_Great Charter_, xxix.)\r\n  says, \"King John’s great seal having been lost in passing the washes\r\n  of Lincolnshire.\"\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe issue of the new Charter was not immediately successful in bringing\r\nthe civil war to an end; but a stream of waverers flowed from Louis to\r\nHenry, influenced partly by the success of the national faction in the\r\nfield and partly by the moderate policy of the government typified by\r\nthe re-issue of the Charter. On 19th May, 1217, the royalists gained a\r\ndecisive victory at the battle known as the “Fair of Lincoln”; and, on\r\n24th August following, Hubert de Burgh, the Justiciar, destroyed the\r\nfleet on which Louis depended. The French prince was compelled to sue\r\nfor peace. Although negotiations were somewhat protracted, the resulting\r\nTreaty of Lambeth bears date the 11th September, 1217, the day on which\r\nthey opened.[245] Several interviews took place at Lambeth between 11th\r\nand 13th September, and these were followed by a general conference at\r\nMerton, commencing on the 23rd, at which Gualo, Louis, the Regent, and\r\nmany English nobles were present.[246] Some difference of opinion exists\r\nas to the exact stages of these negotiations,[247] and it seems best to\r\ntreat as one whole the settlement ultimately arranged. “The treaty of\r\nLambeth is, in practical importance, scarcely inferior to the charter\r\nitself.”[248] It marked the final acceptance by the advisers of the\r\nCrown of the substance of Magna Carta as the permanent basis of\r\ngovernment for England in time of peace, not merely as a provisional\r\nexpedient in time of war. Its terms were equally honourable to both\r\nparties: to the Regent and his supporters, because of the moderation\r\nthey displayed; and to Louis who, while renouncing all claim to the\r\nEnglish Crown, did so only on condition of a full pardon to his allies,\r\ncombined with the guarantee of their cause, so far at least as that was\r\nembodied in the Charter. Ten thousand marks were paid to Louis,\r\nnominally as indemnity for his expenses; but he had in return to restore\r\nthe Exchequer Rolls, the charters of the Jews (that is the rolls on\r\nwhich copies of their starrs or mortgages had been registered),[249] the\r\nCharters of Liberties granted by John at Runnymede, and all other\r\nnational archives in his possession. Sir William Blackstone thinks it\r\nprobable that, under this clause of the treaty, the original of the\r\nArticles of the Barons was handed over, and deposited among the other\r\narchives of the Archbishop of Canterbury at Lambeth Palace where it\r\nremained until the middle of the seventeenth century.[250] One condition\r\nof this general pacification was of supreme importance—the promise given\r\nby the Regent and the papal legate to grant a new and revised Charter.\r\nThis promise was fulfilled some six weeks later, a Charter of Liberties\r\nand a separate Forest Charter being issued on the 6th November,\r\n1217.[251]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 245:\r\n\r\n  Compare what is said of the negotiations at Runnymede, and the date of\r\n  John’s Magna Carta, _supra_, p. 48.\r\n\r\nFootnote 246:\r\n\r\n  Blackstone, _Great Charter_, xxxiv.\r\n\r\nFootnote 247:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._\r\n\r\nFootnote 248:\r\n\r\n  Stubbs, _Const.

M. Bémont accepts this date; see his\r\n  _Chartes_, xxviii., and authorities there cited. Blackstone, _Great\r\n  Charter_, xxxix., gives the probable date as 23rd September. Dr.\r\n  Stubbs, always catholic in his sympathies, gives both dates, 23rd\r\n  September in _Sel. Charters_, 344, and 6th November in _Const. Hist._,\r\n  II. 26. This Charter of Liberties of 1217, originally found among the\r\n  archives of Gloucester Abbey and now in the Bodleian Library at\r\n  Oxford, still bears the impression of two seals—that of Gualo in\r\n  yellow wax, and that of the Regent in green. See Blackstone, _Great\r\n  Charter_, p. xxxv. The existence of the separate Forest Charter was\r\n  only surmised by Blackstone, _Ibid._, p. xlii.; but shortly after he\r\n  wrote, an original of it was found among the archives of Durham\r\n  Cathedral. For an account of this and of its discovery, see Thomson,\r\n  _Magna Charta_, pp. 443-5.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe issue of these two Charters put the copestone to the general\r\npacification of the kingdom. After the wide-spread havoc wrought by two\r\nyears of civil war, the moment had come for a definite and final\r\ndeclaration by the Regent of his policy for ruling an England once more\r\nat peace. Not only was he bound in honour to this course by the Treaty\r\nof Lambeth, but the opportunity was a good one for fulfilling the\r\npromise made in chapter 42 of the Charter of 1216. Accordingly the\r\nrespiting clause of that document now disappeared altogether, and some\r\nnew clauses took its place. The matters reserved for further discussion\r\nas “_gravia et dubitabilia_” had now been reconsidered and were either\r\nfinally abandoned, or else accepted with more or less radical\r\nalterations. The results of these deliberations are to be found in a\r\nnumber of additions to the Charter of Liberties of 1217, the most\r\nimportant of which are chapters 44 and 46, and in the terms of a Forest\r\nCharter now granted for the first time.\r\n\r\nChapter 46 is a “saving clause,” reserving to archbishops, bishops,\r\nabbots, priors, templars, hospitallers, earls, barons, and all other\r\npersons, cleric and lay, the liberties and free customs which they\r\npreviously had. The vagueness of this provision (a mere reference to the\r\nundefined and misty past) deprived it of all practical value. The other\r\naddition was of much greater importance.\r\n\r\nChapter 44 directed that scutages should be taken in the future as they\r\nhad been wont to be taken in the time of Henry II. Now, the rates of\r\nscutage and the procedure for levying it in that reign had been quite\r\nspecific, and could still be read among the Rolls of the Exchequer\r\nrecently recovered from Prince Louis. It was thus easy to define the\r\nvarious innovations of John’s reign, those well-hated additional burdens\r\nwhich had furnished the chief motive for the civil war, and which Henry\r\nIII. was now made to promise should be utterly swept away. This general\r\ncondemnation probably included the increased frequency of John’s\r\nexactions, the assessment of scutages on the new basis provided by the\r\nInquest of 1212, the levy of both scutage and service cumulatively, and,\r\nabove all, the exaction of the high rate of three marks per knight’s\r\nfee. The essence of the demands pressed on the government by the\r\nbaronial leaders in 1217 must undoubtedly have been the return to the\r\nnormal maximum rate of 20s. per knight’s fee. Henry II., we have seen,\r\nsometimes took less, but only on one occasion took more.[252] This\r\nprovision, it should be needless to say, did not preclude the barons\r\nindividually or collectively from volunteering to contribute at a higher\r\nrate; and the necessity of such abnormal contributions would naturally\r\nbe determined at meetings of the _Commune Concilium_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 252:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, p. 88.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe substitution of this definite stipulation of a return to the\r\nwell-known usage of Henry II. in place of the discarded chapters 12\r\nand 14 of John’s Charter (which made “common consent” necessary for\r\n_all_ scutages, whatever the rate) was a natural compromise; and the\r\nbarons in agreeing to it were probably quite justified in thinking,\r\nfrom their own medieval point of view, that they were neither\r\nsubmitting to any unfair abridgments of their rights, nor yet\r\ncountenancing any reactionary measures hurtful to the growth of\r\nconstitutional liberty.[253] Yet when this alteration is viewed by\r\nmodern eyes in the light cast by the intervening centuries of\r\nconstitutional progress, and when it is remembered that the new clause\r\nformed the chief part of the concessions made in 1217 to baronial\r\nclaims, the conclusion inevitably suggests itself that the new\r\nagreement is the proof of retrograde tendencies successfully at work.\r\nAll mention of the _Commune Concilium_—that predecessor of the modern\r\nParliament, that germ of all that has made England famous in the realm\r\nof constitutional laws and liberties—disappears, apparently without\r\nprotest or regret. If the control of taxation by a national assembly,\r\nif the conception of representation, if the indissoluble connection of\r\nthese two principles with each other, ever really found a place in\r\nMagna Carta, they were contemptuously ejected from it in 1216, and\r\nfailed to find a champion in 1217 to demand their restoration.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 253:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Hubert Hall (_Eng. Hist. Rev._, IX. 344) takes a different view,\r\n  however, considering that a reduction of scutages to the old rate of\r\n  the reign of Henry II. was impossible; he speaks of “the astounding\r\n  and futile concession in c. 44 of the charter of 1217.” The clause is\r\n  surely neither astounding nor futile if we regard it as a promise by\r\n  Henry III. that he would not exact more than 20s. per knight’s fee\r\n  _without consent_, and if we further note that it was the practice of\r\n  his reign to ask such consent from the _Commune Concilium_ for\r\n  scutages even of a lower rate. A levy of 10s., for example, was\r\n  granted by a Council in 1221. See Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, II. 33.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nA modern statesman, with any knowledge of the value of constitutional\r\nprinciples, would have gladly seized the occasion of the revision of the\r\nterms of the Charter, to assert and define the functions and rights of\r\nthe Great Council with precision and with emphasis. He would not lightly\r\nhave thrown away the acknowledgment implied in chapters 12 and 14 of\r\n1215—in the germ, at least—of the right of a national council to\r\nexercise a legal control over the levying of taxes. The magnates on both\r\nsides in 1217 were content, however, to abandon to their fate all\r\nabstract principles of constitutional development, provided they could\r\nprotect their lands and purses from an immediate increase of taxation.\r\nFar-reaching problems of the composition and privileges of Parliament\r\nwere unhesitatingly surrendered, as soon as another method of defence\r\nagainst arbitrary increase of scutage was suggested. The barons were\r\nselling, not indeed their birthright, but their best means of gaining\r\nnew rights from the Crown, for “a mess of pottage.”\r\n\r\nSuch considerations, however, must not be pressed too far. It should not\r\nbe forgotten that no one seriously thought in 1217, any more than in\r\n1216, of dispensing with future meetings of the feudal tenants in\r\n_Commune Concilium_. Great Councils indeed continued to meet with\r\nincreasing frequency throughout the reign of Henry III., and the consent\r\nof the magnates therein assembled was habitually asked to scutages even\r\nat a lower rate than that which had been normal in Henry II.’s reign.\r\nSometimes such consent was given unconditionally; sometimes in return\r\nfor a new confirmation of the cherished Charters; sometimes, even, it\r\nwas met by an absolute refusal—the first distinct instance of which\r\nseems to have occurred in January, 1242.[254]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 254:\r\n\r\n  Prothero, _S. de Montfort_, 67.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAnother set of provisions which the respiting clause of 1216 had\r\npromised to reconsider was amply restored in the terms of a separate\r\nForest Charter. This took the place not only of certain chapters of the\r\noriginal grant of 1215 omitted in 1216, but also of chapters 36 and 38\r\nof the grant of 1216. Nothing was, however, done to restore other\r\nimportant omissions, namely, those relating to the Jews, to intestate\r\nsuccession, to free ingress to and egress from England. On the other\r\nhand, additional provisions, not promised in the respiting clause, were\r\ndirected against various abuses of the Crown’s feudal and other\r\nprerogatives.[255]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 255:\r\n\r\n  See cc. 7, 26, and 38 of 1217. Blackstone (_Great Charter_, xxvii.)\r\n  further considers that c. 35 of 1217 contains “more ample provision\r\n  against unlawful disseisins”; and this opinion of a great lawyer is\r\n  shared by a distinguished historian. Mr. Prothero (_Simon de\r\n  Montfort_, 17 n.), finds that the words of the re-issue “are\r\n  considerably fuller and clearer than the corresponding declaration in\r\n  the charter of 1215.” It will be shown, however, _infra_ under chapter\r\n  39, that one object of the alteration was to make it clear that\r\n  holdings of villeins were excluded from the projection of the\r\n  _judicium parium_; and that other alterations in the Charter of 1217\r\n  (_e.g._ chapter 16) are carefully drawn with a similar object.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSo far the Charter of 1217, with its restorations and additions, may be\r\nregarded as a politic effort to secure the support of the barons by\r\nsatisfying their reasonable demands; but it may also be viewed in three\r\nother aspects: (1) as containing provisions for suppressing the anarchy\r\nstill prevalent in several districts, a legacy from the civil war; (2)\r\nas amending some few details of the original grant which the experience\r\nof two years had shown to be defective or objectionable; and (3) as\r\nmaking a first attempt to solve certain problems of government which had\r\ncome quite recently to the foreground, but which were not successfully\r\ngrappled with until three-quarters of a century later, when the\r\nlegislative genius of Edward Plantagenet was brought to bear upon them.\r\n\r\nAmong the chapters restoring order, the most important, with the\r\nexception of those recasting the machinery of administration, was that\r\nwhich ordered the destruction of the “adulterine” castles,[256] that is,\r\nthe private strongholds built by barons without the licence of the\r\nCrown. These remained in 1217, as they had remained in 1154, a result of\r\npast civil war, and a menace to peace and good government in the future.\r\nIt was the aim of every efficient ruler to abolish all fortified\r\ncastles—practically impregnable in the thirteenth century when artillery\r\nwas unknown—except those of the King, and to see that the royal castles\r\nwere under command of “constables”[257] of approved loyalty. John had\r\nplaced his own strongholds under creatures of his own, who, after his\r\ndeath, refused to give them up to his son’s Regent. The attempt to\r\ndislodge these soldiers of fortune, two years later, led to new\r\ndisturbances in which the famous Falkes de Breauté played a leading\r\npart.[258] The destruction of “adulterine” castles and the resumption of\r\nroyal ones were both necessary accompaniments of any real pacification.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 256:\r\n\r\n  C. 47 of 1217.\r\n\r\nFootnote 257:\r\n\r\n  See _infra_ under cc. 24 and 45.\r\n\r\nFootnote 258:\r\n\r\n  Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, II. 32.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe re-issue of 1217 may also be regarded as bearing some analogy to a\r\nmodern amending Statute. Experience, for example, had suggested the\r\ndesirability of several alterations in the procedure for holding petty\r\nassizes. Many objections had been taken to the dispatch of Justices,\r\nwith commissions to hold assizes in the various counties, so frequently\r\nas four times every year. It was now agreed to reduce these circuits\r\nfrom once a quarter to once a year—a concession to those who felt the\r\nburden of too frequent attendance.[259] Although the king’s Justices\r\nwere still to enjoy the co-operation of knights from each county, it was\r\nno longer specially mentioned that these knights should be _elected_.\r\nAll pleas of darrein presentment were removed from the jurisdiction of\r\nthe Justices on circuit, and reserved for the consideration of “the\r\nBench,” presumably now settled at Westminster.[260] The two other\r\nassizes (novel disseisin and mort d’ancestor) were still left to the\r\nking’s Justices in the respective counties where the lands lay, but\r\ndifficult points of law were reserved for “the Bench.”[261] The\r\ninferiority of the Justices of Assize to the Courts at Westminster was\r\nthus made clear.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 259:\r\n\r\n  C. 13 of 1217.\r\n\r\nFootnote 260:\r\n\r\n  C. 15 of 1217.\r\n\r\nFootnote 261:\r\n\r\n  C. 14 of 1217.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe same natural reluctance of those who owed suit to the local courts,\r\nto neglect their own affairs in order to perform public duties, which\r\nled to the demand for less frequent visits of the Justices of Assize,\r\nled also to an emphatic restatement of the old customary rules as to\r\nattendance at County Courts. Ordinary sessions were not to be held more\r\nfrequently than once a month, nor was the sheriff to make his Tourn, or\r\nlocal circuit, throughout the various hundreds of his county more\r\nfrequently than twice a year, namely at Easter and Michaelmas: and only\r\nat Michaelmas was he to hold view of frankpledge—one of the most\r\nimportant functions performed by him in the course of his circuit.[262]\r\nIt was a more distinct concession to the feudal anti-centralizing\r\nspirit, that this royal view of frankpledge—for the sheriff acted as the\r\nking’s deputy—was prohibited from infringing any freeman’s franchises,\r\nwhether such franchises had existed under Henry II. or had been\r\nsubsequently acquired.[263]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 262:\r\n\r\n  C. 42 of 1217.\r\n\r\nFootnote 263:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._ This seems to imply that all the aggressions since Henry’s\r\n  reign, had not been on one side. The barons, in obtaining a promise to\r\n  respect “franchises” acquired since 1189, tacitly admitted that they\r\n  had been recently encroaching on royal prerogatives. By the Statute of\r\n  Gloucester and the subsequent _quo warranto_ procedure Edward I. made\r\n  a partially successful effort to redress the balance.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTwo questions, destined to become of supreme importance in the future,\r\nhave also left traces on this re-issue of the Charter:—on chapters 39\r\nand 43 respectively. The former treats of the vexed question of a feudal\r\ntenant’s right to dispose of parts of his holding by gift or sale. There\r\nwere two different methods of effecting this—by way of subinfeudation or\r\nby way of substitution: the tenant might create a new link in the feudal\r\nchain by granting part of his lands to a third party, who became his\r\nvassal as a result of the new grant; or he might endeavour to make the\r\ndonee the direct vassal of his overlord, _quoad_ the land he had newly\r\nacquired. There was here a direct conflict of interest between overlord\r\nand tenant, which extended to both ways of conveying land. Freedom to\r\nsell it or give it away was clearly an advantage to the tenant; while\r\nthe lord objected to a transaction which might thrust on him new vassals\r\nhe did not desire, or might divide between two or more vassals the\r\nobligations formerly incumbent on one, making the incidence of feudal\r\nburdens uncertain and their enforcement more difficult. Chapter 39\r\ncontained a compromise. The tenant might part with a portion of his\r\nholding, provided the balance he reserved was sufficient to ensure full\r\nperformance by himself of the obligations due to the lord. The original\r\nvassal thus remained primarily liable for the whole of the feudal\r\nobligations (whatever right of relief he might have against his donees\r\nor sub-tenants), and must reserve in his own hands sufficient lands out\r\nof the proceeds of which to fulfil them. The final solution of the\r\nproblem, here temporarily disposed of, was contained in the Statute\r\ncommonly known as _Quia Emptores_,[264] which allowed the tenant to\r\ndispose of parts of his estate by way of substitution, while forbidding\r\nsubinfeudation entirely.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 264:\r\n\r\n  18 Edward I., also known as Westminster III.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nChapter 43 marks the growing hostility against the accumulation by the\r\nmonasteries of wealth in the form of landed estates, and begins the\r\nseries of legislative measures which culminated in the Statute of\r\nMortmain.[265] The times were not ripe in 1217 for a final solution of\r\nthis problem, and the charter of that year contented itself with an\r\nattempt to remedy one of the subsidiary abuses of the system merely, and\r\nnot to abolish the main evil. An ingenious expedient had been devised by\r\nlawyers to enable tenants to cheat their lords out of some of the lawful\r\nfeudal incidents. Religious houses formed one species of corporation,\r\nand all corporations made bad tenants, since, as they never died, the\r\nlord of the fief was deprived of the possibility of a wardship, relief,\r\nor escheat falling to him. This was a hardship; but it was not unfair,\r\nprovided that the transaction which made the abbey or monastery owner of\r\nthe subjects was a _bona fide_ one. Sometimes, however, more or less\r\ncollusive agreements were made between a lay free-holder and a religious\r\nhouse whereby a new link was inserted in the feudal chain to the\r\nprejudice of the freeholder’s lord. The freeholder bestowed his lands on\r\na particular house, which took his place as the new tenant of the lord\r\nand then subinfeudated the same subjects to the original tenant, who\r\nthus got his lands back again, but now became tenant of the church, not\r\nof his former lord. The lord was thus left with a corporation for his\r\ntenant and lost all the profitable incidents, which would, under the new\r\narrangement, accrue to the church when the freeholder died. Such\r\nexpedients were prohibited, under pain of forfeiture, by chapter 43 of\r\nthe re-issue of 1217; and this prohibition was interpreted very\r\nliberally by the lords in their own favour.[266]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 265:\r\n\r\n  7 Edward I., also known as the Statute _de religiosis_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 266:\r\n\r\n  See Pollock and Maitland, I. 314.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThese were the main alterations made in 1217 in the tenor of the Great\r\nCharter.[267] This re-issue is of great importance, since it represents\r\npractically the final form taken by the Charter, only two changes being\r\nmade in subsequent issues.[268] On the 22nd February, 1218, copies of\r\nthe Great Charter in this new form were sent to the sheriffs to be\r\npublished and enforced. In the writs accompanying them, the special\r\nattention directed to the clause against unlicensed castles shows the\r\nimportance attached to their demolition.[269]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 267:\r\n\r\n  Minor variations are discussed under their appropriate chapters\r\n  _infra_. A full list is given by Blackstone, _Great Charter_, xxxvi.\r\n\r\nFootnote 268:\r\n\r\n  _Cf._ Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, II. 27. “This re-issue presents the\r\n  Great Charter in its final form.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 269:\r\n\r\n  The terms of these writs are preserved in _Rot. Claus._, I. 377.\r\n\r\nThe Regent and the ministers of the Crown seem to have felt increasingly\r\nthe inconvenience of conducting the government without a great seal of\r\nthe King. There was a natural reluctance to accept grants authenticated\r\nmerely by substitutes for it, since these might not be treated as\r\nbinding on the monarch when he came of age. The Regent at last agreed to\r\nthe engraving of a great seal for Henry, but not without misgivings. To\r\nprevent it being used by unscrupulous ministers to validate lavish\r\ngrants to their own favourites to the impoverishment of the Crown, the\r\nCouncil, on the advice of the Regent, issued a proclamation that no\r\ncharter or other deed implying perpetuity should be granted under the\r\nnew seal during the King’s minority—a saving clause of which Henry was\r\ndestined to make a startling use. This proclamation was probably issued\r\nsoon after Michaelmas 1218.[270]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 270:\r\n\r\n  Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, II. 30. The _Annals of Waverley_, p. 290,\r\n  speak of a re-issue of the charters about this date; but this probably\r\n  results from confusion with what happened a year earlier. See Stubbs,\r\n  _Ibid._\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOn 14th May, 1219, England lost a trusted ruler through the death of the\r\naged Regent, whose loyalty, firmness, and moderation had contributed so\r\nmuch to repair the breaches made in the body politic by John’s evil\r\ndeeds, and the consequent civil war. After the good Earl of Pembroke’s\r\ndeath, the Bishop of Winchester and Hubert de Burgh contended for the\r\nchief place in Henry’s councils, with alternating success, but neither\r\nof them succeeded to the title of _Rector regis et regni_.[271] A few\r\nyears later, the young King seems to have grown impatient under the\r\nrestraints of a minority, and the Roman Curia was ready to bid for his\r\ngoodwill by humouring him. In 1223 Honorius III., by letter dated 13th\r\nApril, declared Henry (then only in his sixteenth year) to be of full\r\nage as regarded most of the duties of a king.[272]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 271:\r\n\r\n  Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, II. 31.\r\n\r\nFootnote 272:\r\n\r\n  Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, II. 32, and authorities there cited.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe terms of this papal letter may have suggested to some of Henry’s\r\ncouncillors the possibility of renouncing the Charters on the ground\r\nthat they had been granted to the prejudice of the King before he had\r\nbeen declared of full age. One of his flatterers, William Briwere by\r\nname, at a “colloquium” held in January, 1223, advised him to repudiate\r\nthe two Charters when requested by Stephen Langton to confirm them.\r\nBriwere’s bold words are reported by Matthew Paris.[273] “_Libertates\r\nquas petitis, quia violenter extortae fuerunt, non debent de jure\r\nobservari._” This doctrine of repudiation moved the primate to anger,\r\nand Henry, still accustomed to leading-strings, gave way, swearing to\r\nobserve the terms of both charters. An element of truth, however,\r\nunderlay Briwere’s advice, and the whole incident probably showed to the\r\nmore far-seeing friends of liberty the necessity of a new and\r\n_voluntary_ confirmation of the Charters by the King. An opportunity for\r\nsecuring this occurred next year, when Henry at Christmas, 1224,\r\ndemanded one-fifteenth of all his subjects’ moveables. He was met by a\r\nfirm request that he should, in return for so large a grant, renew Magna\r\nCarta. The result was the re-issue on 11th February, 1225, of both\r\nCharters each of which was, as a matter of course, fortified by the\r\nimpression of the great seal recently made. The importance of the whole\r\ntransaction was enhanced by the declaration made by Honorius III. only\r\ntwo years previously, that Henry was of full age to act for himself. The\r\nnew forest Charter was practically identical with that issued in 1217;\r\nwhile the only alterations in the tenor of the Charter of Liberties were\r\nthe result of a laudable determination to place on record the\r\ncircumstances in which it had been granted. In the new preamble Henry\r\nstated that he conceded it “_spontanea et bona voluntate nostra_” and\r\nall reference to the consent of his magnates was omitted, although a\r\ngreat number of names appear as witnesses at the close of the Charter.\r\nThese alterations were intended to emphasize the fact that no pressure\r\nhad been brought to bear on him, and thus to meet future objections such\r\nas William Briwere had suggested in 1223, namely, that the confirmation\r\nof the Charter had been extorted by force.[274]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 273:\r\n\r\n  _Chronica Majora_, III. 76.\r\n\r\nFootnote 274:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Stubbs thinks that in thus avoiding one danger, a greater danger\r\n  was incurred. \"It must be acknowledged that Hubert, in trying to bind\r\n  the royal conscience, forsook the normal and primitive form of\r\n  legislative enactment, and opened a claim on the king’s part to\r\n  legislate by sovereign authority without counsel or consent.\" (_Const.\r\n  Hist._, II. 37.) This seems to exaggerate the importance of an\r\n  isolated precedent, the circumstances of which were unique. The\r\n  confirmation was something far apart from an ordinary “legislative\r\n  enactment.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe “consideration” also clearly appears in the concluding portion of\r\nthe Charter, where it is stated that in return for the foregoing gift of\r\nliberties along with those granted in the Forest Charter, the\r\narchbishops, bishops, abbots, priors, earls, barons, knights, free\r\ntenants, and all others of the realm had given a fifteenth part of their\r\nmoveables to the King.\r\n\r\nThe prominence given to this feature brings the transaction embodied in\r\nthe re-issue of 1225 (as compared with the original grant of 1215) one\r\nstep nearer the legal category of “private bargain.” It is, in one\r\naspect, simply a contract of purchase and sale. Another important new\r\nclause follows—founded probably on a precedent taken from chapter 61 of\r\nthe Charter of King John: Henry is made significantly to declare “And we\r\nhave granted to them for us and our heirs, that neither we nor our heirs\r\nshall procure any thing whereby the liberties in this charter shall be\r\ninfringed or broken; and if any thing shall be procured by any person\r\ncontrary to these premises, it shall be held of no validity or effect.”\r\nThis provision was clearly directed against future papal dispensations\r\nor abrogations, such as that which King John had obtained from Innocent\r\nin 1215. The clause, however, was diplomatically made quite general in\r\nits terms.[275]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 275:\r\n\r\n  A few minor alterations, such as the omission of the clause against\r\n  unlicensed castles (now unnecessary) and some verbal changes need not\r\n  be mentioned. A list of these is given by Blackstone, _Great Charter_,\r\n  l.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOne original copy of this third re-issue of the Great Charter is\r\npreserved at Durham with the great seal in green wax still perfect,\r\nthough the parchment has been “defaced and obliterated by the\r\nunfortunate accident of overturning a bottle of ink.”[276] A second is\r\nto be found at Lacock Abbey, in Wiltshire. The accompanying Forest\r\nCharter is also preserved at Durham.[277]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 276:\r\n\r\n  See Blackstone, _Ibid._, xlvii. to l.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 277:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis third re-issue brings the story of the genesis of the Great Charter\r\nto an end. It marked the final form assumed by Magna Carta; the\r\nidentical words were then used which afterwards became stereotyped and\r\nwere confirmed, time after time, without further modification. It is\r\nthis Charter of 1225 which is always referred to in the ordinary\r\neditions of the Statutes, in the courts of law, in parliament, and in a\r\nlong series of classical law books beginning with the second _Institute_\r\nof Sir Edward Coke.[278]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 278:\r\n\r\n  One slight exception should be noted. In one point of detail a change\r\n  had occurred since 1225; the rate of relief payable from a barony had\r\n  been reduced from £100 to 100 marks. See _infra_ under chapter 2.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAlthough the Charter, thus, in 1225 took the permanent place it has\r\nsince retained among the fundamental laws of England, it was not yet\r\nsecure from attacks. Two years later the actions of Henry raised strong\r\nsuspicions that he would gladly annul it, if he dared.\r\n\r\nThe young King, in spite of the Pope’s bull declaring him of full age in\r\n1223, had in reality only passed from one set of guardians to another;\r\nhe had long chafed under the domination of the able but unscrupulous\r\nPeter des Roches, Bishop of Winchester, when in the beginning of 1227 he\r\nsuddenly rebelled. Acting probably under the advice of Hubert de Burgh,\r\nwho wished to return to power, Henry determined to shake off the control\r\nof Bishop Peter. At a Council held at Oxford in January, 1227, Henry,\r\nthough not yet twenty, declared himself of full age;[279] and soon\r\nthereafter showed what use he intended to make of his newly acquired\r\nfreedom. Making an unexpected application of the proclamation issued by\r\nthe Regent, William Marshal, in 1218, that the great seal should not,\r\nduring the minority, be used to authenticate any grants in perpetuity of\r\nroyal demesne lands or other rights of the Crown, Henry now interpreted\r\nthis to imply the nullity of all charters whatsoever which had been\r\nissued under the great seal since his accession. He even tentatively\r\napplied this startling doctrine to the Forest Charter.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 279:\r\n\r\n  A bull of Gregory IX., dated 13th April, 1227, confirmed Henry in this\r\n  declaration that his minority was ended. See Blackstone, _Great\r\n  Charter_, li., and Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, II. 39.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHenry’s new policy seems to have been endorsed by the magnates present,\r\nand on 21st January, 1227, he issued by their “common counsel” a series\r\nof “letters close” directing that all recipients of Crown charters must\r\napply for their renewal—a ceremony requiring, of course, to be\r\nhandsomely paid for. On 9th February a second series of “letters close”\r\nwas issued, resulting in the extension of many forests to their old\r\nboundaries once more.[280]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 280:\r\n\r\n  See _Rot. Claus._, II. 169, and Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, II. 40, where\r\n  it is suggested that “the declaration seems merely to have been a\r\n  contrivance for raising money.” This is not quite accurate. Mr. G. J.\r\n  Turner, in his introduction to _Select Pleas of the Forest_, pp. xcix.\r\n  to cii., gives a full and convincing account of Henry’s procedure and\r\n  motives. “The king neither repudiated the Charter of the Forest nor\r\n  annulled the perambulations which had been made in his infancy. He\r\n  merely corrected them after due inquiry.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFears, apparently unfounded, that the Great Charter was in danger, seem\r\nto have been rife. If Henry really entertained any intention of setting\r\naside Magna Carta, it is fortunate that the attack upon it, suggested to\r\nthe King by William Briwere in January, 1223, was not seriously\r\nattempted until four years later. The delay was of supreme importance,\r\nsince there had intervened the third re-issue of the Charter containing\r\nthe declaration that the King had acted voluntarily, and fortified by\r\nthe facts that Honorius had previously declared him of full age for such\r\npurposes, and that he had accepted a price for the confirmation of the\r\nCharter. Henry could not now repudiate the papal dispensation which he\r\nhad gladly accepted and acted upon four years earlier. In this way the\r\nre-issue of both charters in 1225 had gone far to secure the national\r\nliberties. Henry shrank from any open infringement of the Great Charter;\r\nand, although he was partially successful in restoring the forests to\r\ntheir old wider boundaries, thus undoing many reforms of his minority,\r\nhe proceeded without violating the letter of the Forest Charter.\r\nHenceforward, Henry’s attitude towards the charters was a settled one,\r\nand easily understood. He confirmed them with a light heart whenever he\r\ncould obtain money in return, and thereafter acted as though they did\r\nnot exist.\r\n\r\nHenceforth history is concerned not with re-issues but with\r\nconfirmations of the Great Charter. Of these the number is considerable,\r\nbeginning with that granted at Westminster on 28th January, 1237;[281]\r\nbut it forms no part of the scheme of this Historical Introduction to\r\ndescribe these in detail.[282] One of them, the so-called _Confirmatio\r\nCartarum_ of 5th November, 1297, is specially important, not because it\r\nis a confirmation, but because it is something more. It contains new\r\nclauses which impose restrictions on the taxing power of the Crown; and\r\nthese, to some extent, take the places of those chapters (12 and 14) of\r\nthe original grant of John, which had been omitted in all intervening\r\nre-issues and confirmations.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 281:\r\n\r\n  Blackstone, _Great Charter_, 68–9; Stubbs, _Sel. Charters_, 365–6.\r\n\r\nFootnote 282:\r\n\r\n  The more important among them are enumerated by Coke in his second\r\n  _Institute_, p. 1. Further details are given by Blackstone, _Great\r\n  Charter_, lii.; Thomson, _Magna Charta_, 437–446; and in Bémont,\r\n  _Chartes_, pp. xxx. to liii.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nA Statute of 1369 (42 Edward III. c. 1), requires special notice, since\r\nit commands that “the Great Charter and the Charter of the Forest be\r\nholden and kept in all points, and if any statute be made to the\r\ncontrary that shall be holden for none.” Parliament in 1369 thus sought\r\nto deprive future Parliaments of the power to effect any alterations\r\nupon the terms of Magna Carta. Yet, if Parliament in that year had the\r\npower to add anything by a new legislative enactment to the ancient\r\nbinding force of the Great Charter, it follows that succeeding\r\nParliaments, in possession of equal powers, might readily undo by a\r\nsecond statute what the earlier statute had sought to effect. If\r\nParliament had power to alter the sacred terms of Magna Carta itself, it\r\nhad equal power to alter the less sacred statute of 1369 which declared\r\nit unalterable. The terms of that statute, however, are interesting as\r\nperhaps the earliest example on record of the illogical theory\r\n(frequently reiterated in later years) that the English Parliament might\r\nuse its present legislative supremacy in such a manner as to limit the\r\nlegislative supremacy of other Parliaments in the future.\r\n\r\n              II. Magna Carta and the Reforms of Edward I.\r\n\r\nThe Great Charter, alike from its excellences and from its defects,\r\nexercised a potent influence on the trend of events throughout the two\r\nsucceeding reigns. It is hardly too much to say that the failure of\r\nMagna Carta to provide adequate machinery for its own enforcement is\r\nresponsible for the spirit of unrest and for the protracted struggles\r\nand civil war which made up the troubled reign of Henry III.; while the\r\ndifference of attitude assumed by Henry and by his son Edward\r\nrespectively towards the scheme of reform it embodied explains the\r\nfundamental difference between the two reigns—why the former was so full\r\nof conflicts and distress, while the latter was so prosperous and\r\nprogressive. To trace the history of these reigns in detail lies outside\r\nthe scope of this Historical Introduction. It seems necessary, however,\r\nto emphasize such outstanding events as have an obvious and close\r\nconnection with the Great Charter, and also to outline the policy of\r\nEdward, which led ultimately to the triumph of its underlying\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental difference between the reigns of Henry III. and Edward\r\nI. lies in this, that while Henry, in spite of numerous nominal\r\nconfirmations of Magna Carta, never loyally accepted the settlement it\r\ncontained, Edward, on the contrary, acquiesced in the main provisions of\r\nthe Great Charter, under many subtle modifications it is true, yet\r\nhonestly on the whole, and with a sincere intention to carry them into\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the attitude even of Henry III. towards Magna Carta\r\nindicates a distinct advance upon that of his father. It was much that\r\nthe advisers of John’s infant heir solemnly accepted, on behalf of the\r\nCrown, the provisions of the Charter, and strove to enforce them during\r\nthe minority; and it was even more that Henry, on attaining majority,\r\nconfirmed the arrangement thus arrived at, freely and on his own\r\ninitiative, and found himself thereafter unable openly to repudiate the\r\nbargain he had made. Yet the settlement of the dissensions between Crown\r\nand baronage was still nominal rather than real. In the absence of\r\nproper constitutional machinery, the king was merely bound by bonds of\r\nparchment which he could break at pleasure. The victory of the friends\r\nof liberty proved a hollow one, since unsupported promises count for\r\nlittle in the great struggles fought for national liberties. Even the\r\ncrude constitutional devices of the Charter of 1215 entirely disappeared\r\nfrom its confirmations; and, in the absence of all sanctions for its\r\nenforcement, the Charter became an empty expression of good intentions.\r\nIf a quarrel arose, no constitutional expedient existed to reconcile the\r\ndisputants—nothing to obviate a final recourse to the arbitrament of\r\ncivil war. Thus, part of the blame for the recurring and devastating\r\nstruggles of the reign of Henry III. must be attributed to the defects\r\nof the Great Charter.\r\n\r\nThe whole interest of the reign indeed lies in the various attempts made\r\nto evolve adequate machinery for enforcing the liberties contained in\r\nMagna Carta. Experiments of many kinds were tried in the hope of turning\r\ntheory into practice. The system of government outlined in the\r\nProvisions of Oxford of 1258, for example, reproduced the defects of the\r\ncrude scheme contained in chapter 61 of the Great Charter, and added new\r\ndefects of its own. It sought to keep the king in the paths of good\r\ngovernment by the coercion of a body of his enemies. This baronial\r\ncommittee was not designed to enter into friendly co-operation with\r\nHenry in the normal work of government, but rather to supersede entirely\r\nhis right to exercise certain of the royal prerogatives. No glimmering\r\nwas yet apparent of the true solution afterwards adopted with success.\r\nIt was not yet realized that the best way to control the Crown was\r\nthrough the agency of its own ministers, and not by means of a hostile\r\nopposition organized for rebellion—that the correct policy was to make\r\nit difficult for the king to rule except through regular ministers, and\r\nto secure that all such ministers should be men in whom the _Commune\r\nConcilium_ reposed confidence and over whom it exercised control.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Simon de Montfort may have had some vague conception of\r\nthe real constitutional remedy for the evils of the reign; but his\r\nideals were overruled in 1258 by the more extreme section of the\r\nbaronial party. Earl Simon indeed had one opportunity of putting his\r\ntheories into practice. During the brief interval between the battle of\r\nLewes, which made him supreme for the moment, and the battle of Evesham,\r\nwhich ended his career, he enjoyed an unfettered control over the\r\nmovement of reform; and some authorities find in the provisional scheme\r\nof government, by means of which he attempted to realize his political\r\nideals in the closing months of 1264, traces of the true constitutional\r\nexpedient afterward successfully adopted as a solution of the problem.\r\nIn one respect, undoubtedly, the Earl of Leicester did influence the\r\ndevelopment of the English constitution; he furnished the first\r\nprecedent for a national Parliament, which reflected interests wider\r\nthan those of the Crown tenants and the free-holders, when he invited\r\nrepresentatives of the boroughs to take their places by the side of the\r\nrepresentatives of the counties in the national council summoned to meet\r\nin January, 1265. His schemes of government, however, were not fated to\r\nbe realized by him in a permanent form. The utter overthrow of his\r\nfaction followed his decisive defeat and death at Evesham on 4th August,\r\n1265.\r\n\r\nThe personal humiliation of Simon de Montfort, however, in reality\r\nassured the ultimate triumph of the cause he had made his own. Prince\r\nEdward, from the moment of his brilliant victory at Evesham, was not\r\nonly supreme over his father’s enemies, but henceforth he was supreme\r\nalso within his father’s councils. He found himself in a position at\r\nonce to realize some of his most important political ideals; and from\r\nthe very moment of his victory, he adopted as his own, with some\r\nmodification, it is true, the main constitutional conceptions of his\r\nuncle Earl Simon, who had been his friend and teacher before he became\r\nhis deadliest enemy.\r\n\r\nEdward Plantagenet, alike when acting as the chief adviser of his aged\r\nfather and after he had succeeded him on the throne, not only accepted\r\nthe main provisions of the Great Charter,[283] but adopted also, along\r\nwith them, a new scheme of government which formed their necessary\r\ncounterpart. To Edward is due the first dim conception of “parliamentary\r\ngovernment,” to this extent at least, that the king, as head of the\r\nexecutive government, should take a national council into partnership\r\nwith him in the work of national administration. His political ideals\r\nwere the natural result of the experience obtained during the later\r\nyears of his father’s reign; and he endeavoured to embody in his scheme\r\nof government the best parts of the various experiments in which that\r\nreign abounded. His policy, although founded on that of his uncle Simon\r\nde Montfort, was profoundly modified by his own individual genius. The\r\nvery fact of the adoption of Earl Simon’s ideals by the heir to the\r\nthrone entirely altered their chances of success. All such schemes had\r\nbeen foredoomed to failure so long as they merely emanated from an\r\nopposition leader however powerful; but their triumph was speedily\r\nassured now that they were accepted as a programme of reform by the\r\nmonarch himself. Henceforth the new political ideals, summed up in the\r\nconception of a national Parliament, were to be fostered by the Crown’s\r\nactive support, not merely thrust upon the monarchy from without.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 283:\r\n\r\n  The best proof of this will be found in a comparison of Magna Carta\r\n  with the Statute of Marlborough, and the chief statutes of Edward’s\r\n  reign, notably that of Westminster I.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nUnder the protection of Edward I.—the last of the four great\r\nmaster-builders of the constitution—the _Commune Concilium_ of the\r\nAngevin kings (itself a more developed form of the Curia Regis of the\r\nConqueror and his sons) grew into the English Parliament. This implied\r\nno sudden dramatic change, but a long slow process of adjustment, under\r\nthe guiding hand of Edward.\r\n\r\nThe main features of his scheme may be briefly summarized: Edward’s\r\nconception of his position as a national king achieving national ends,\r\nthe funds necessary for effecting which ought to be contributed by the\r\nnation, naturally led him to devise a system of taxation which would\r\nfill the Exchequer while avoiding unnecessary friction with the\r\ntax-payer. His problem was to keep his treasury full in the way most\r\nconvenient to the Crown, and at the same time to reduce to a minimum the\r\ndiscontent and inconvenience felt by the nation at large under the\r\nburden. In broadening the basis of taxation, he was led to broaden the\r\nbasis of Parliament; and thus he advanced from the feudal conception of\r\na _Commune Concilium_, attended only by Crown tenants, to the nobler\r\nideal of a national Parliament containing representatives of every\r\ncommunity and every class in England. The composition of the great\r\ncouncil was altered; the principle of representation known for centuries\r\nbefore the Conquest in English local government, now found a home, and,\r\nas it proved, a permanent home, in the English Parliament. It was\r\nobvious that Parliament, whose composition was thus altered, must meet\r\nmore frequently than of old. Edward elevated the national council from\r\nits ancient position of a mere occasional assembly reserved for special\r\nemergencies, to a normal and honoured place in the scheme of government.\r\nHenceforth, frequent sessions of parliament became a matter of course.\r\n\r\nThe powers of this assembly also widened almost automatically, with the\r\nwidening of its composition. Taxation was its original function, since\r\nthat was the primary purpose (so the best authorities maintain in spite\r\nof some adverse criticism) for which the representatives of the counties\r\nand the boroughs had been called to it. Legislation, or the right to\r\nveto legislation, was soon added—although at first the new-comers had\r\nonly a humble share in this. The functions of hearing grievances and of\r\nproffering advice had, even in the days of the Conqueror, belonged to\r\nsuch of the great magnates as were able to make their voices heard in\r\nthe Curia Regis; and similar rights were gradually extended to the\r\nhumbler members of the augmented assembly. The representatives of\r\ncounties and of towns retained rights of free discussion even after\r\nParliament had split into two separate Houses. These rights, fortified\r\nby command of the purse strings, tended to increase, until they secured\r\nfor the Commons some measure of control over the executive functions of\r\nthe king. This parliamentary control varied in extent and effectiveness\r\nwith the weakness of the king, with his need of money, and with the\r\npolitical situation of the hour.\r\n\r\nThe new position and powers of Parliament logically involved a\r\ncorresponding alteration in the position and powers of the smaller but\r\nmore permanent council or _Concilium Ordinarium_ (the future Privy\r\nCouncil). This had long been increasing in power, in prestige, and in\r\nindependence, a process quickened by the minority of Henry III. The\r\nCouncil was now strengthened by the support of a powerful Parliament,\r\nusually acting in alliance with the leaders of the baronial opposition.\r\nThe members of the Council were generally recruited from Parliament, and\r\ntheir appointment as king’s ministers and members of the Curia was\r\nstrongly influenced by the proceedings in the larger assembly.\r\n\r\nThe Council thus became neutral ground on which the conflicting\r\ninterests of king and baronage might be discussed and compromised. Wild\r\nschemes like that of chapter 61 of Magna Carta or like that typified in\r\nthe Committee appointed by the Mad Parliament in 1258, were now\r\nunnecessary. The king’s own ministers, backed by Parliament, became an\r\nadequate means of enforcing the constitutional restraints embodied in\r\nroyal Charters. The problem was thus, for the time being, solved. A\r\nproper sanction had been devised, fit to change royal promises into\r\nrealities.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, Edward’s aim of ruling as a national king implied the\r\nfrequent assembling of a central parliament composed of individuals\r\nfitted to act as links between the Crown and the various classes of the\r\nEnglish nation whom he expected to contribute to the national Exchequer.\r\nIt implied also that the national business should be conducted by\r\nministers likely to command the confidence of that parliament.[284]\r\nThus, Edward’s policy dimly foreshadowed some of the most fundamental\r\nprinciples of modern constitutional government—parliament,\r\nrepresentation, ministerial responsibility. Edward Plantagenet was, of\r\ncourse, far from realizing the full meaning of these conceptions, and if\r\nhe had realized it, he would have been most unwilling to accept them;\r\nyet he was unconsciously helping forward the cause of constitutional\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 284:\r\n\r\n  The doctrine that the _Commune Concilium_ should have some voice in\r\n  the appointment of the Ministers of the Crown had indeed been acted\r\n  upon on several occasions even in the reign of Henry III. See Stubbs,\r\n  _Const. Hist._, II. 41.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis temporary solution, during the reign of Edward I., of an\r\never-recurring problem of government has been viewed in two different\r\naspects. It is sometimes regarded simply as the result of the pressure\r\nof events—as a natural phenomenon evolved, subject to natural laws, to\r\nmeet the needs of the age. By other writers it is attributed to the\r\nwisdom and conscious action of King Edward. The two views are perhaps\r\nnot so inconsistent as they at first sight seem, since great men work in\r\nharmony with the spirit of their times, and appear to control events\r\nwhich they only interpret and express. The bargain made at Runnymede\r\nbetween the English monarch and the English nation found its necessary\r\ncounterpart and sanction, before the close of the thirteenth century, in\r\nthe conception of a king ruling through responsible ministers and in\r\nharmony with a national Parliament. Edward Plantagenet was merely the\r\ninstrument by whose agency the new conception was for a time partially\r\nrealized. Yet, he merits the gratitude of posterity for his share in the\r\nelaboration of a working scheme of government, which took the place of\r\nthe clumsy expedients designed as constitutional sanctions by the barons\r\nin 1215. He supplied the logical complement of the theories vainly\r\nenunciated in John’s Great Charter, thus changing empty expressions of\r\ngood intentions into accomplished facts. The ultimate triumph of the\r\nprinciples underlying Magna Carta was assured through the constitutional\r\nmachinery devised by Edward Plantagenet.\r\n\r\n                                PART V.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNA CARTA: ORIGINAL VERSIONS, PRINTED EDITIONS, AND COMMENTARIES.\r\n\r\n         I. Manuscripts of Magna Carta and Relative Documents.\r\n\r\nThe barons who had forced the Great Charter on King John were determined\r\nthat its contents should be widely known and permanently preserved. It\r\nwas not sufficient that the great seal should be formally impressed upon\r\none parchment. Those who compelled John to submit were not content even\r\nwith the execution of its terms in duplicate or in triplicate, but\r\ninsisted that the great seal should be appended to many copies all of\r\npractically identical terms and of equal authority. These were to be\r\ndistributed throughout the land, and to be preserved in important\r\nstrongholds and among the archives of the chapters of cathedral\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\nI. _The extant original versions._ Of the many copies of the Charter\r\nauthenticated under John’s great seal, four have escaped the destroying\r\nhand of time, and may still be examined by members of the public after\r\nnearly seven centuries have passed. These four records are:\r\n\r\n(1) _The British Museum Magna Carta, number one_—formally cited as\r\n“Cotton, Charters XIII. 31A.” The recent history of this document is\r\nwell known. It was found among the archives of Dover Castle in the\r\nseventeenth century; and not improbably it may have lain there for\r\ncenturies before, possibly from a date not much later than that of its\r\noriginal execution; for the castle of Dover, like the Tower of London,\r\nwas a natural place for the preservation of documents of national value.\r\nThere it was discovered by Sir Edward Dering while warden of the castle,\r\nand by him it was presented to Sir Robert Cotton, accompanied by a\r\nletter dated 10th May, 1630.[285] It still forms an item in the\r\ncollection preserved in the British Museum, which bears the name of the\r\nfamous antiquary.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 285:\r\n\r\n  This letter is also preserved in the British Museum, and cited as\r\n  “Cotton, Julius, C. III. Fol. 191.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn the great fire of 23rd October, 1731, which attacked the Cottonian\r\nLibrary, this valuable Charter was seriously damaged and rendered in\r\nparts illegible, while the yellow wax of the seal was partially melted.\r\nIt is possible that this accident has added somewhat to the prestige of\r\nthis particular copy of Magna Carta, which, like the three others still\r\nextant, is written continuously, though with many contractions, in a\r\nneat, running, Norman hand. A special characteristic of this version is\r\nthat some omissions seem to have been made in the body of the deed and\r\nto have been supplied at the foot of the parchment. These are five in\r\nnumber.[286] It is possible to regard them as corrections of clerical\r\nomissions due to carelessness or hurry in engrossing the deed; but the\r\nfact that one of the additions is distinctly in the King’s favour raises\r\na strong presumption that they embodied additions made as afterthoughts\r\nto what had been originally dictated to the engrossing clerk, and that\r\nthey were inserted at the King’s suggestion before he would adhibit the\r\ngreat seal.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 286:\r\n\r\n  These are carefully noted among the variations described by the\r\n  editors of the Charters of Liberties forming Part I. of the first\r\n  volume of the _Statutes of the Realm_. These addenda are (1) at the\r\n  end of c. 48, “_per eosdem, ita quod nos hoc sciamus prius, vel\r\n  justiciarius noster, si in Anglia non fuerimus_,” providing that the\r\n  King should receive intimation of all forest practices branded as\r\n  “evil” before they are abrogated; (2) two small additions, near the\r\n  beginning of c. 53, (a), “_et eodem modo de justicia exhibenda_,” and\r\n  (b) “_vel remansuris forestis_”; (3) in c. 56, these four words, “_in\r\n  Anglia vel in Wallia_”; and (4) in c. 61 the words “_in perpetuum_”\r\n  after “_gaudere_.” In the 2nd British Museum MS. three of these\r\n  addenda appear at the foot, viz. (1), (2_a_) and (2_b_); but the words\r\n  of (3) and (4) are incorporated in the body of that MS.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe importance of this document was recognized at a comparatively early\r\ndate, and a facsimile prepared by John Pine, a well-known engraver of\r\nthe day, some eighteen months after the great fire. The engraving bears\r\na certificate dated 9th May, 1733, narrating that the copy is founded on\r\nthe original, which had been shrivelled up by the heat; but that where\r\ntwo holes had been burned, the obliterated words had been replaced from\r\nthe other version (to be immediately described), also preserved in the\r\nCottonian collection.\r\n\r\n(2) _The British Museum Magna Carta, number two_—formally cited as\r\n“Cotton, Augustus, II. 106.” The early history of this document is\r\nunknown, but sometime in the seventeenth century it came into the\r\npossession of Mr. Humphrey Wyems, and by him it was presented to Sir\r\nRobert Cotton on 1st January, 1628–9. Unlike the other Cottonian copy,\r\nthis one is happily in an excellent state of preservation; but there is\r\nno trace left of any seal.[287] Three of the five addenda inserted at\r\nthe foot of the copy previously described are found in a similar\r\nposition here; but the substance of the two others is included in the\r\nbody of the deed. On the left-hand margin, titles intended to be\r\ndescriptive of several chapters occur in a later hand.[288] Thus for the\r\npreservation of two original copies of the national charter of liberties\r\nthe nation is indebted to Sir Robert Cotton, but for whose antiquarian\r\nzeal they might both have been lost. Apparently, however, a story told\r\nby several authors[289] as to the humiliating fate which threatened the\r\noriginal Magna Carta must be rejected. Sir Robert, it is said,\r\ndiscovered “the palladium of English liberties” in the hands of his\r\ntailor at the critical moment when the scissors were about to transform\r\nit into shapes for a suit of clothes. This is undoubtedly a fable, since\r\nboth manuscripts of Magna Carta in the Cottonian collection are\r\notherwise accounted for.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 287:\r\n\r\n  “The fold and label are now cut off, though it is said once to have\r\n  had slits in it for two seals, for which it is almost impossible to\r\n  account; but Dr. Thomas Smith, in his Preface to the _Cottonian\r\n  Catalogue_, Oxford, 1695, folio, states that they were those of the\r\n  barons” (Thomson, _Magna Charta_, 425).\r\n\r\nFootnote 288:\r\n\r\n  Reproductions of this copy are sold at the British Museum at 2s. 6d.\r\n  each.\r\n\r\nFootnote 289:\r\n\r\n  See Isaac D’Israeli, _Curiosities of Literature_, I. 18, and Thomson,\r\n  _Magna Charta_, 424.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(3) _The Lincoln Magna Carta._ This copy is under the custody of the\r\nDean and Chapter of the Cathedral, where it has undoubtedly lain for\r\nmany centuries. It has been suggested that Bishop Hugh of Lincoln,\r\ncanonized by the Roman Church, whose name appears in the list of\r\nmagnates consenting to John’s grant, may have brought it with him from\r\nRunnymede on his return to Lincoln. The word “Lincolnia” is endorsed in\r\na later hand in two places at the back of the document on folds of the\r\nparchment. It has no corrections or additions inserted at the foot, but\r\nembodies in their proper places all those which occurred in the versions\r\nalready discussed. Further, it is executed with more flourishes and in a\r\nmore finished manner than these, and the inference is that it took\r\nlonger to engross. The Record Commissioners in preparing the _Statutes\r\nof the Realm_ considered this version as of superior authority to any of\r\nthe others and have accordingly chosen it as the copy for their\r\nengraving of Magna Carta published in 1810 in that valuable work, and\r\nalso in the first volume of their edition of Rymer’s _Foedera_ in\r\n1816.[290]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 290:\r\n\r\n  The engraving was executed to their order by James Basire.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(4) _The Salisbury Magna Carta_—preserved in the archives of the\r\nCathedral there. The early history of this manuscript has not been\r\ntraced, but its existence was known at the close of the seventeenth\r\ncentury.[291] Sir William Blackstone, in April, 1759,[292] instituted a\r\nsearch for it, but without success—his inquiries being met with the\r\nstatement that it had been lost some thirty years before, during the\r\nexecution of repairs in the Cathedral library. As its disappearance had\r\nreally taken place during the tenure of the see by Gilbert Burnet, whose\r\nantiquarian interests were well known, his political adversaries accused\r\nhim of appropriating it—an undoubted calumny, yet one to which some\r\ncolour was lent by facts to be hereafter explained. The document had not\r\nbeen re-discovered in 1800 when the royal commission published its\r\nreport of the result of its inquiries for national records.[293] Two\r\nsub-commissioners visited Salisbury in 1806 in search of it, but\r\nobtained no satisfaction. It seems, however, to have been re-discovered\r\nwithin the next few years, since it is mentioned in a book published in\r\n1814,[294] and it is now exhibited to the public by order of the Dean\r\nand Chapter of Salisbury Cathedral. It resembles the Lincoln copy both\r\nin its beautiful leisurely writing and also in the absence of additions\r\nat the bottom of the parchment.[295]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 291:\r\n\r\n  See James Tyrrell, _History of England_, Vol. II. 821 (1697-1704).\r\n\r\nFootnote 292:\r\n\r\n  Blackstone, _Great Charter_, p. xvii.\r\n\r\nFootnote 293:\r\n\r\n  See _Report_ (1800), p. 341, containing the Return by the Chapter\r\n  Clerk of the Cathedral Church of Salisbury, dated 15th May, 1800.\r\n\r\nFootnote 294:\r\n\r\n  Dodsworth, _Historical Account of the Cathedral_, 202.\r\n\r\nFootnote 295:\r\n\r\n  It is unnecessary to treat in detail of the copies of the charter not\r\n  authenticated by John’s Great Seal, though some of these are of great\r\n  value as secondary authorities. The four most important are (_a_) a\r\n  copy appearing in the Register of Gloucester Abbey, (_b_) the Harleian\r\n  MSS., British Museum No. 746 (which also contains the names of the\r\n  twenty-five Executors in a hand probably of the reign of Edward I.),\r\n  (_c_) in the Red Book of the Exchequer. There is also (_d_) an early\r\n  French version, printed in D’Achery, _Spicilegium_, Vol. XII. p. 573,\r\n  together with the writ of 27th September addressed to the Sheriff of\r\n  Hampshire. See Blackstone, _Great Charter_, p. xviii., and Thomson,\r\n  _Magna Charta_, pp. 428-430.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nII. _Comparison of the Originals._ Prior to the publication of Sir\r\nWilliam Blackstone’s great work, extraordinary confusion seems to have\r\nprevailed concerning the various Charters of Liberties. Not only was\r\nJohn’s Magna Carta confused with the various re-issues by Henry; but\r\nthese latter were known only from an official copy of the Charter of\r\n1225 contained in the confirming statute of the twenty-eighth year of\r\nthe reign of Edward I., known as an “Inspeximus,” because of the opening\r\nword of the King’s declaration that he had seen the document of which he\r\ngave a copy. Neither Madox[296] nor Brady[297] was aware of the\r\nexistence of any one of the four originals; and no mention is made of\r\nthem in the first edition of Rymer’s _Foedera_, which appeared in 1704.\r\nMr. Tyrrell indeed seems to have known of the second original copy in\r\nthe British Museum and also of the Salisbury version.[298] Mr. Care[299]\r\nshowed no clear knowledge of the various manuscripts, though he\r\nmentioned the existence of several. Even Sir William Blackstone in 1759\r\ncollated only the two Cottonian copies, since he failed to find that of\r\nSalisbury, and was unaware of the existence of the Lincoln\r\nmanuscript.[300]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 296:\r\n\r\n  Thomas Madox, _Firma Burgi_ (1726). On p. 45, Madox refers only to the\r\n  _Inspeximus_ of Edward I.\r\n\r\nFootnote 297:\r\n\r\n  Robert Brady, _Complete History of England_, p. 126 of Appendix to\r\n  Vol. I. (1685), takes his text of the Charter from Matthew Paris,\r\n  “compared with the manuscript found in Bennet College Library.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 298:\r\n\r\n  James Tyrrell, _History of England_ (1697-1704). In p. 9 of Appendix\r\n  to Vol. II. p. 821, Tyrrell prints a text of John’s Charter founded on\r\n  that of M. Paris, collated with those two originals.\r\n\r\nFootnote 299:\r\n\r\n  Henry Care, _English Liberties in the Freeborn subjects’ inheritance;\r\n  containing Magna Charta_, etc. (1719), p. 5. The first edition, with a\r\n  somewhat different title, is dated 1691.\r\n\r\nFootnote 300:\r\n\r\n  Strangely enough, Sir Thomas Duffus Hardy, so recently as 1837, in\r\n  publishing his _Rotuli Chartarum_ (Introduction, p. ii. note 5)\r\n  declared that no original of John’s Charter existed. Many copies, he\r\n  knew, had been \"made and deposited, for the sake of perpetuation, in\r\n  all the principal religious houses in the kingdom. However,\r\n  notwithstanding all the care taken by multiplication of copies, it is\r\n  singular that no contemporary copy of King John’s Magna Carta has yet\r\n  been found.\" The Lincoln MS. he dismissed as “certainly not of so\r\n  early a date,” while he confuses the only one of the British Museum\r\n  MSS. known to him with the Articles of the Barons. He further\r\n  reasserts the fallacy, so clearly exposed by Blackstone eighty years\r\n  earlier, that John had issued a separate _Carta de Foresta_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAs these four versions are practically identical in their substance—the\r\nvariations being merely in the use of contractions or in other verbal\r\nchanges of a trivial character—no important question seems to be\r\ninvolved in the discussion as to whether any one of them has greater\r\nvalue than the others. The Record Commissioners considered that the\r\nLincoln copy was the first to be completed (and therefore that it\r\npossessed special authority), because, unlike the two Cottonian copies,\r\nit contained no insertions at the foot of the instrument. Yet it seems\r\nmore plausible to argue that this very immunity from clerical errors, or\r\nfrom additions made after engrossment, proves that it was of later and\r\nless hurried execution than the others, and therefore of less authority,\r\nif any distinction is permissible. Mr. Thomson has much ground for his\r\ncontention in speaking of the fire-marked version in the British Museum\r\nthat “the same circumstances may probably be a proof of its superior\r\nantiquity, as having been the first which was actually drawn into form\r\nand sealed on Runnymede, the original whence all the most perfect copies\r\nwere taken.”[301]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 301:\r\n\r\n  Thomson, _Magna Charta_, 422.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn all printed texts of Magna Carta, the contents are divided into a\r\npreamble and sixty-three chapters, and each chapter is numbered and\r\ntreated in a separate paragraph by itself. There is no warrant for this\r\nin any one of the four originals, all of which run straight on from\r\nbeginning to end, like other feudal charters, and contain no numbers or\r\nother indication where one provision ends and another begins. Strictly\r\nspeaking, Magna Carta has thus no chapters: these are a modern\r\ninvention, made for convenience of reference.\r\n\r\nIII. _The Articles of the Barons._ Of hardly inferior historical\r\ninterest to these four original copies of the Great Charter is the\r\nparchment which contains the heads of the agreement made between John\r\nand the rebels on 15th June, 1215, from which the Charter was afterwards\r\nexpanded. The parchment containing these heads, known as the Articles of\r\nthe Barons, is now in the British Museum, cited officially as “Donation\r\nMSS. 4838.” The seven centuries which have passed over it have left\r\nsurprisingly few traces; it is quite legible throughout, and still bears\r\nthe impression of John’s great seal in brown wax. It is probable that\r\nthis document may have passed with other English records into the hands\r\nof Prince Louis during the civil war which followed close on the\r\ntransaction at Runnymede; that it was handed over to the Regent William\r\nMarshal in terms of the Treaty of Lambeth concluded in September, 1217;\r\nand that thereafter it was deposited in Lambeth Palace, where it\r\nremained until the middle of the seventeenth century. Archbishop Laud\r\nseems to have been aware of its historical interest, as he placed it\r\namong the more precious documents in his keeping. When threatened with\r\nimpeachment by the Long Parliament, he thought it prudent to set his\r\npapers in order; and on 18th December, 1640, he dispatched for that\r\npurpose to his episcopal palace, his friend Dr. John Warner, Bishop of\r\nRochester.\r\n\r\nThere was indeed no time to lose; a few hours later, Laud was committed\r\nto the custody of Black-Rod, and an official messenger was sent by the\r\nHouse of Lords to seal up his papers. Bishop Warner had, however,\r\nescaped with the Articles of the Barons before this messenger arrived;\r\nhe kept it till he died, and at his death it passed to one of his\r\nexecutors named Lee, and from him to his son Colonel Lee, who presented\r\nit to Gilbert Burnet, afterwards Bishop of Salisbury and author of the\r\nfamous _History of His Own Time_. When the Salisbury Magna Carta\r\ndisappeared, Burnet was suspected of appropriating it to his own uses.\r\nThe grounds which gave some apparent weight to the misrepresentations of\r\nhis political opponents were that special facilities had been granted to\r\nhim to search public records in the prosecution of his historical\r\nlabours, and that as matter of fact he actually had in his\r\npossession—quite lawfully, as we now know—the Articles of the Barons,\r\nwhich was confused by the carelessness of early historians with Magna\r\nCarta itself. The calumny was so widely spread that Burnet thought it\r\nnecessary formally to refute it, explaining that he had received the\r\nArticles as a gift from Colonel Lee. “So it is now in my hands, and it\r\ncame very fairly to me.”\r\n\r\nBishop Burnet left it as a legacy to his son Sir Thomas Burnet; and on\r\nhis death it passed to his executor David Mitchell, whose permission to\r\nprint it Blackstone obtained in 1759. Shortly thereafter it was\r\npurchased from Mr. Mitchell’s daughter by another great historian,\r\nPhilip, second Earl of Stanhope, and by him it was presented to the\r\nBritish Museum in 1769. It is now exhibited to the public along with the\r\ntwo Cottonian copies of Magna Carta. The Record Commissioners have\r\nreproduced it in facsimile in _Statutes of the Realm_ in 1810, and also\r\nin the _New Rymer_ in 1816.[302]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 302:\r\n\r\n  Reproductions of it, as well as of the second Cottonian version of the\r\n  Charter, are sold by the authorities of the British Museum at the\r\n  price of 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe document begins with this headline: “_Ista sunt Capitula quae\r\nBarones petunt et dominus Rex concedit._” Then the articles follow in 49\r\nparagraphs of varying length, separate, but unnumbered, each new chapter\r\n(unlike the chapters of Magna Carta, which run straight on as befits its\r\ncharacter as a charter) beginning a new line. The numbers which\r\ninvariably appear in all printed editions have no warrant in the\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nA blank space sufficient for two lines of writing occurs between\r\nparagraphs 48 and 49, indicating perhaps that the last chapter, which\r\ncontains the revolutionary provision for the appointment of the\r\ntwenty-five Executors, had been added as an after-thought. Chapters 45\r\nand 46 are connected by a rude bracket, and a clause is added in the\r\nsame hand as the rest, but more rapidly, modifying the provisions of\r\nboth in the King’s favour. This, at least, is clearly an\r\nafter-thought.[303]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 303:\r\n\r\n  _Cf. supra_, p. 47, and Blackstone, _Great Charter_, xvii.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIV. _The so-called “unknown Charter of Liberties.”_ Among the French\r\narchives there is preserved the copy of what purports to be a charter\r\ngranted by King John, but irregular in its form. This document is\r\npreserved among the _Archives du Royaume_ in the _Section Historique_\r\nand numbered J. 655.[304] A copy of this copy was discovered at the\r\nRecord Office in London by Mr. J. Horace Round in 1893, previous to\r\nwhich date it seems to have been practically unknown to English\r\nhistorians, although it had been printed by a French writer thirty years\r\nearlier.[305] Mr. Round communicated his discovery of this “unknown\r\ncharter of liberties” to the _English Historical Review_, in the pages\r\nof which there ensued a discussion as to its nature and validity,\r\ninaugurated by him. Three theories were suggested: (_a_) Mr. Round\r\nmaintained that the document was a copy, in a mangled form perhaps, of a\r\ncharter actually granted in the year 1213 by King John to the northern\r\nbarons, containing concessions which they had agreed to accept in\r\nsatisfaction of their claims.[306] (_b_) Mr. Prothero preferred to view\r\nit, not as an actually executed charter, given and accepted in\r\nsettlement of the various claims in dispute, but rather as an abortive\r\nproposal made by the King early in 1215 and rejected by the barons.[307]\r\n(_c_) Mr. Hubert Hall dismissed the document as a forgery, and described\r\nit as \"a coronation charter attributed to John by a French scribe in the\r\nsecond decade of the thirteenth century\"—probably between November,\r\n1216, and March, 1217, when King Philip desired to prove that John had\r\ncommitted perjury by breaking his promises, and had thereby forfeited\r\nhis right to the Crown of England.[308]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 304:\r\n\r\n  See the account given by Mr. Hubert Hall, _English Historical Review_,\r\n  IX. 326.\r\n\r\nFootnote 305:\r\n\r\n  Alexandre Teulet, _Layettes du Trésor_, I. p. 423 (1863).\r\n\r\nFootnote 306:\r\n\r\n  _Engl. Hist. Rev._, VIII. 288-294.\r\n\r\nFootnote 307:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, IX. 117-121.\r\n\r\nFootnote 308:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, IX. 326-335.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMr. Hall describes the method of procedure adopted by the compiler of\r\nthis supposed forgery. Placing in front of him copies of Henry I.’s\r\nCharter of Liberties and of Henry III.’s charters issued in 1216-17, he\r\nproceeded to select from these sources whatever suited his purpose, and\r\nthereafter “either by design or carelessness, or ignorance of English\r\nforms, he altered the wording of both his originals so as to produce the\r\neffect of a paraphrase interspersed with archaisms.” This extremely\r\ningenious theory is not entirely convincing. Not to insist on the number\r\nof unproved inferences on which it is based, it seems to have one grave\r\ndefect—it ignores the absurdity of attempting to obtain credence for\r\nsuch a clumsy composition, especially when it was well known that John\r\nhad never granted a coronation charter at all. Even if a skilful forger\r\ncould have utilized the document as the basis for a completed charter,\r\nthis would still have required the impress of John’s great seal to give\r\nit validity. Such an imposture could not be seriously intended to impose\r\non any one.\r\n\r\nA fourth theory may be suggested very tentatively, namely, that the\r\ndocument in question is a copy of the actual schedule drawn up by the\r\nbarons previous to 27th April, 1215. That such a schedule existed we\r\nknow from the express declaration of Roger of Wendover,[309] who informs\r\nus that it was sent to the King with the demand that his seal should be\r\nforthwith placed to it, under threat of civil war. From this, it is safe\r\nto infer that the schedule, as it left the barons’ hands, was ready for\r\nexecution; but lack of experience in drawing up Crown charters would\r\nprevent them from producing an entirely regular instrument. They would\r\nassuredly take as their model the charter of Henry I., which had helped\r\nto give definiteness of aim to all their efforts. It would be necessary,\r\nhowever, to bring this up to date, by additions which we might _a\r\npriori_ expect to resemble the provisions afterwards adopted with more\r\nelaboration in the agreement made at Runnymede. This schedule, then,\r\nrapidly thrown together, would be likely to contain many of the\r\ncharacteristics actually discovered by Mr. Hall in the document under\r\ndiscussion. Such an identification of the “unknown Charter of Liberties”\r\nwith the schedule of 27th April, 1215, would explain all the features\r\nemphasized by Mr. Hall—the archaisms, the erroneous style, and the\r\nemployment, first of the third person singular, and then of the first\r\nperson singular, instead of using throughout the first person plural\r\ninvariably used by John. It would also explain why the first half of the\r\nparchment on which the “unknown charter” is written, contains a copy of\r\nHenry I.’s charter, and why the two possess so many features in common.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 309:\r\n\r\n  R. Wendover, III. 298, and _cf. supra_, p. 40.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt would clearly be inadvisable to found any conclusions upon the terms\r\nof a document, the nature and authenticity of which form the subject of\r\nso many rival theories; but even if further investigation proves it to\r\nbe a forgery, a forgery of contemporary date may throw light on\r\notherwise obscure passages in genuine charters. One or two instances of\r\nthis will be found in the sequel.\r\n\r\n                II. Previous Editions and Commentaries.\r\n\r\nEvery general history of England and almost every book which has ever\r\nappeared on English law has had something to say by way of commentary on\r\nMagna Carta. It is perhaps for this very reason that exceedingly few\r\ntreatises have been devoted exclusively to its elucidation. While\r\nedition after edition of the text of the Charter, or of its re-issues,\r\nhave appeared, few of these have been accompanied by explanations\r\nhowever brief. The paucity of attempts to explain the meaning of the\r\nCharter is almost more remarkable than the frequency with which the text\r\nhas been reproduced. Magna Carta is a document often printed, but seldom\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nI. _Printed Editions of the Text of Magna Carta._ Previous to 1759 even\r\nthe best informed writers on English history laboured under much\r\nconfusion in regard to the various charters of liberties. Few of them\r\nseem to have been aware that fundamental differences existed between the\r\noriginal charter granted by John and the re-issues of Henry III. Much of\r\nthe blame for this confusion must be borne by Roger of Wendover, who, in\r\nhis account of the transactions at Runnymede, incorporated, in place of\r\nJohn’s Charter, the text of the two charters granted by Henry.[310]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 310:\r\n\r\n  R. Wendover, III. 302-318.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe early historians were content to rely either on this version or on\r\nthat contained in the _Inspeximus_ of Edward I. Thus, in all early\r\nprinted collections of statutes, the text which professes to represent\r\nthe original Charter follows in reality the words of Henry’s third\r\nre-issue. The very earliest printed edition of Magna Carta seems to have\r\nbeen that published on 9th October, 1499, by Richard Pynson, the King’s\r\nprinter,[311] and a contemporary of Wynkyn de Worde. This was not, of\r\ncourse, John’s Charter, but followed Edward’s _Inspeximus_ of Henry’s\r\nCharter of 1225.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 311:\r\n\r\n  This date is given by Bémont, _Chartes_, lxxi., but Robert Watt in his\r\n  _Bibliotheca Britannica_, Thomson, _Magna Charta_, 450, and Lowndes,\r\n  _Bibliographer’s Manual_, 1449, all give the date of the earliest\r\n  edition as 1514. Bémont, lxxi., and Thomson, 450–460, Watt, and\r\n  Lowndes furnish details of the various editions of Pynson, Redman,\r\n  Berthelet, Tottel, Marshe, and Wight, from 1499 to 1618. All of these\r\n  are now superseded by the _Statutes of the Realm_, published by the\r\n  Record Commission in 1810.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSince the middle of the eighteenth century, many editions of the text of\r\nJohn’s Great Charter have been published, either alone or along with the\r\ntext of the various re-issues of the reign of Henry III.; but it seems\r\nunnecessary to mention more than four of these.\r\n\r\n(1) In 1759 appeared Sir William Blackstone’s scholarly work entitled\r\n_The Great Charter and The Charter of the Forest_, containing accurate\r\ntexts of all the important issues of the Charters of Liberties carefully\r\nprepared from the original manuscripts so far as these were known to\r\nhim.[312]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 312:\r\n\r\n  The substance of this admirable edition, now unhappily scarce, has\r\n  been reproduced in the same author’s _Tracts_ (1762).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(2) In some respects the Record Commissioners have improved even on\r\nBlackstone’s work in their edition of the _Statutes of the Realm_,\r\npublished in 1810. A special section of the volume is devoted to\r\nCharters of Liberties, where not only the grants of John and Henry III.,\r\nbut also the charters which led up to them, and their subsequent\r\nconfirmations, have received exhaustive treatment.\r\n\r\n(3) A carefully revised text, _Magna Carta regis Johannis_, was\r\npublished by Dr. Stubbs in 1868; and the various charters are also to be\r\nfound, arranged in chronological order, in his well-known volume, first\r\npublished in 1870, entitled _Select Charters and other illustrations of_\r\n_English Constitutional History_, a convenient collection easily\r\naccessible to all students of law and history.\r\n\r\n(4) For the continuous study of the sequence of charters, the best book\r\nof reference is _Chartes de Libertés Anglaises_ by M. Charles Bémont\r\npublished in 1892, in the pages of which the various editions of John’s\r\nand Henry’s charters will be found in a form convenient for comparison\r\nwith each other, and with previous and succeeding documents.\r\n\r\nII. _Commentaries and Treatises._ It is doubtful whether any good\r\npurpose would be served by the preparation of a list of all the books\r\nwhich contain casual references to Magna Carta or to its provisions; and\r\nit is clear that the task would be an extremely burdensome one. There is\r\nno difficulty, however, in naming the few treatises of outstanding merit\r\nwhich have been exclusively or mainly devoted to the exposition of the\r\nGreat Charter. Of these only nine require special mention.\r\n\r\n(1) The mysterious medieval lawbook known as the _Mirror of Justices_\r\ncontains a chapter upon Magna Carta which has some claims to rank as a\r\ncommentary, although it represents the opinions of a political\r\npamphleteer rather than those of an unbiassed judge. The date of this\r\ntreatise is still the subject of dispute. It has been usual to place it\r\nnot earlier than the years 1307-27, mainly because it makes mention of\r\n“Edward II.” Prof. Maitland, however, dates it earlier, maintaining on\r\ngeneral grounds that it was “written very soon after 1285, and probably\r\nbefore 1290.”[313] He explains the reference to “Edward II.” as applying\r\nto the monarch now generally known in England as Edward I., but\r\nsometimes in his own reign known as Edward II., to distinguish him from\r\nan earlier Edward, still enshrined in the popular imagination, namely,\r\nEdward Confessor. Mr. Maitland is not disposed to treat this work of an\r\nunknown author too seriously, and warns students against “his ignorance,\r\npolitical bias, and deliberate lies.”[314]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 313:\r\n\r\n  See _The Mirror of Justices_ (edited for the Selden Society by Prof.\r\n  Maitland), _Introd._, xxiii. to xxiv.\r\n\r\nFootnote 314:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, xxxvii. _Cf._ xlviii.\r\n\r\n(2) Dismissing the _Mirror_, then, as a dangerous and possibly\r\ndisingenuous guide, the earliest serious commentary known to exist is\r\nthat of Sir Edward Coke, formerly Lord Chief Justice. This elaborate\r\ntreatise, forming the second of Coke’s four _Institutes_, was published\r\nin 1642 under direction of the Long Parliament, the House of Commons\r\nhaving given the order on 12th May, 1641.[315]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 315:\r\n\r\n  See _Dictionary of National Biography_, XI. 243.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAlthough this commentary, like everything written by Coke, was long\r\naccepted as a work of great value, its method is in reality entirely\r\nuncritical and unhistorical. The great lawyer reads into Magna Carta the\r\nentire body of the common law of the seventeenth century of which he was\r\nadmittedly a master. He seems almost unconscious of the great changes\r\naccomplished by the experience and vicissitudes of the four eventful\r\ncenturies which had elapsed since the Charter had been originally\r\ngranted. The various clauses of Magna Carta are thus merely occasions\r\nfor expounding the law as it stood, not at the beginning of the\r\nthirteenth century, but in his own day. In the skilful hands of Sir\r\nEdward, the Great Charter is made to attack the abuses of James or\r\nCharles, rather than those of John or Henry, which its framers had in\r\nview. In expounding the _judicium parium_, for example, he carefully\r\nexplains many minute details of procedure before the Court of the Lord\r\nHigh Steward, and describes elaborately the nature of the warrants to be\r\nissued prior to the arrest of any one by the Crown; while, in the clause\r\nof Henry’s Charter which secures an open door to foreign merchants in\r\nEngland “unless publicly prohibited,” he discovers a declaration that\r\nParliament shall have the sole power to issue such prohibitions,\r\nforgetful that the regulation of trade was an exclusive prerogative of\r\nthe Crown with which Parliament had no right to interfere for many\r\ncenturies subsequent to the reign of Henry III.\r\n\r\n(3) In 1680 Mr. Edward Cooke, barrister, published a small volume\r\nentitled _Magna Charta made in the ninth year of King Henry III. and\r\nconfirmed by King Edward I. in the twenty-eighth year of his reign_.\r\nThis contained a translation of Henry’s Magna Carta with short\r\nexplanatory notes founded mainly on the commentary of Sir Edward Coke.\r\nIn his Preface, Mr. Cooke declared that his object was to make the Great\r\nCharter more accessible to the public at large, since, as he said, “I am\r\nconfident, scarce one of a hundred of the common people, know what it\r\nis.”\r\n\r\n(4) Sir William Blackstone’s _Introduction_ to his edition of the\r\ncharters, published in 1759, as already mentioned, contains valuable\r\ninformation as to the documents he edits; but he explicitly disclaims\r\nall intention of writing a Commentary. He is careful to state “that it\r\nis not in his present intention, nor (he fears) within the reach of his\r\nabilities, to give a full and explanatory comment on the matters\r\ncontained in these charters.”[316]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 316:\r\n\r\n  Introduction, p. ii.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(5) The Hon. Daines Barrington published in 1766 his _Observations upon\r\nthe Statutes from Magna Charta to 21 James I._ This book contains some\r\nnotes on the Charter also founded chiefly upon Coke’s _Second\r\nInstitute_; his original contributions are not of outstanding value.\r\n\r\n(6) In 1772 Prof. Francis Stoughton Sullivan gave to the public his\r\ncourse of lectures previously delivered in the University of Dublin\r\nunder the title _An Historical Treatise on the Feudal Law, with a\r\nCommentary on Magna Charta_. The author’s own words give a sufficiently\r\naccurate conception of its scope and value: “I shall therefore proceed\r\nbriefly to speak to _Magna Charta_, and in so doing shall omit almost\r\nall that relates to the feudal tenures, which makes the greatest part of\r\nit, and confine myself to that which is now law.”[317]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 317:\r\n\r\n  See p. 375 of the work cited.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(7) Mr. John Reeves’ invaluable _History of English Law_, the first\r\nedition of which appeared in 1783-84, marked the commencement of a new\r\nepoch in the scientific study of the genesis of English law. Treating\r\nincidentally of Magna Carta, he shows wonderful insight into the real\r\npurport of many of its provisions, but the state of historical knowledge\r\nwhen he wrote rendered many serious errors inevitable.\r\n\r\n(8) In 1829, Mr. Richard Thomson published an elaborate edition of the\r\ncharters combined with a commentary which contains much useful\r\ninformation, but makes no serious attempt to supplement the unhistorical\r\nexplanations of Sir Edward Coke by the results of more recent\r\ninvestigations in the provinces of law and history. His work is a\r\nstorehouse of information which must, however, be used with caution.\r\n\r\n(9) In many respects, the most valuable contribution yet made to the\r\nelucidation of the Great Charter is that contained in M. Charles\r\nBémont’s preface to his _Chartes des Libertés Anglaises_, published in\r\n1892. Although he has subjected himself to the severe restraints imposed\r\nby the slender size of his volume and by a rigid desire to state only\r\nfacts of an undisputed nature, leaving theories strictly alone; he has,\r\nnevertheless, done much to help forward the study of the charters. In\r\nparticular he has performed an important service by insisting upon the\r\nclose mutual connection between the various Charters of Liberties, from\r\nthat of Henry I. down to the confirmations of Edward I., and of\r\nsubsequent kings. It is doubtful, however, whether by this very\r\ninsistence upon the gradual process of development which may be traced\r\nin this long series, he does not lay himself open to the misconception\r\nthat he takes too narrow a view of the scope and relations of the\r\nCharter. Magna Carta’s points of contact with the past and future\r\nhistory of English liberties and English laws and institutions must not\r\nbe narrowed down to those occurring in one straight line. Its\r\nantecedents must not be looked for exclusively among documents couched\r\nin the form of charters, nor its results merely in their subsequent\r\nconfirmations. It is impossible to understand it aright, except in close\r\nrelation to all the varied aspects of the national life and the national\r\ndevelopment. Every Act appearing on the Statute Rolls is, in a sense, an\r\nAct amending Magna Carta; while such enactments as the Statute of\r\nMarlborough and the Statute of Westminster I. have as intimate a\r\nconnection with John’s Great Charter as the _Confirmatio Cartarum_ or\r\nthe _Articuli super Cartas_ have. This is a truth which M. Bémont\r\nundoubtedly recognizes, though the scheme of his book led him rather to\r\nemphasize another and, at first sight, contradictory aspect of his\r\nsubject. His object was not to explain the numerous ways in which the\r\nCharters of Liberties are entwined with the whole of English history,\r\nbut merely to furnish a basis for the accurate study of one of their\r\nmost important features. His book is indispensable, but is not intended\r\nto form, in any sense, a commentary on Magna Carta.\r\n\r\nIt would thus appear that only two serious attempts have been made to\r\nproduce treatises forming, explicitly and exclusively, commentaries on\r\nthe Great Charter, namely the _Second Institute_ of Coke and the\r\nlaborious and useful work of Mr. Richard Thomson. Since Mr. Thomson’s\r\n_Magna Charta_ appeared, three-quarters of a century have passed,\r\nmarking an enormous advance in historical and legal science; yet the\r\nresults of modern research, so capable of throwing light on the\r\nsubject-matter of the Great Charter, have never been systematically\r\nbrought to bear upon it. Dr. Stubbs, from whom such a work would have\r\nbeen especially welcome, contented himself with giving a paraphrase or\r\nabstract of the Charter, rendering into English equivalents as literally\r\nas possible the actual words of his Latin text—a cautious course, which\r\ncannot lead his disciples astray, but leaves them to the guidance of\r\ntheir own ignorance rather than of his knowledge. The reason given by\r\nDr. Stubbs for keeping silence is rather the excess than the absence of\r\ninformation. “The whole of the constitutional history of England,” he\r\ntells us, “is little more than a commentary on Magna Carta.”[318] It is\r\nfor this reason, presumably, that he refrains from all explanations and\r\nconfines himself to an abstract of its main provisions. While thus many\r\ninvaluable hints may be obtained from the pages of the three volumes of\r\nhis history, and from his other works, Dr. Stubbs has not in any of his\r\npublished writings contributed anything of the nature of a direct\r\ncommentary upon John’s Great Charter. In this policy, he has been\r\nfollowed by the members of the great modern school of English historians\r\nof which he is the founder.[319]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 318:\r\n\r\n  See _Const. Hist._, I. 572, and cf. _Select Charters_, 296.\r\n\r\nFootnote 319:\r\n\r\n  One of the most brilliant members of that school, Mr. Prothero, whose\r\n  power of rendering difficult subjects both lucid and interesting would\r\n  specially have qualified him for the task of explaining Magna Carta,\r\n  declines the task partly upon the ground that it would be impossible\r\n  \"to throw any new light on a subject exhausted by the ablest\r\n  writers.\"—_S. de Montfort_, p. 14.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMany valuable hints may be obtained from other writers such as Dr.\r\nGneist, Sir Edward Creasy, Mr. Taswell Langmead, Dr. Hannis Taylor, Miss\r\nNorgate, and Sir James Ramsay,[320] but their efforts to explain the\r\nmeaning of the Great Charter take the form of disconnected notes, rather\r\nthan of exhaustive commentaries.[321]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 320:\r\n\r\n  The works of these and other authors are mentioned in the Appendix.\r\n\r\nFootnote 321:\r\n\r\n  It is unnecessary to do more than mention _A Historical Treatise on\r\n  Magna Charta_ by Mr. Boyd C. Barrington, of the Philadelphia Bar\r\n  (1899), of which the author says (p. ii.): “No claim is made for\r\n  originality, but solely for research, which has been exhaustive in\r\n  every line I can pursue.” It is dismissed by his distinguished\r\n  fellow-countryman, Dr. Gross (_Sources and Literature of English\r\n  History_, p. 348), as “of little value.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n                   TEXT, TRANSLATION, AND COMMENTARY.\r\n\r\n                              MAGNA CARTA.\r\n\r\n                             PREAMBLE.[322]\r\n\r\nJohannes Dei gratia rex Anglie, dominus Hibernie, dux Normannie et\r\nAquitannie, et comes Andegavie, archiepiscopis, episcopis, abbatibus,\r\ncomitibus, baronibus, justiciariis, forestariis, vicecomitibus,\r\nprepositis, ministris et omnibus ballivis et fidelibus suis salutem.\r\nSciatis nos intuitu Dei et pro salute anime nostre et omnium\r\nantecessorum et heredum nostrorum, ad honorem Dei et exaltationem sancte\r\nEcclesie, et emendacionem regni nostri, per consilium venerabilium\r\npatrum nostrorum, Stephani Cantuariensis archiepiscopi tocius Anglie\r\nprimatis et sancte Romane ecclesie cardinalis, Henrici Dublinensis\r\narchiepiscopi, Willelmi Londoniensis, Petri Wintoniensis, Joscelini\r\nBathoniensis et Glastoniensis, Hugonis Lincolniensis, Walteri\r\nWygorniensis, Willelmi Coventriensis, et Benedicti Roffensis\r\nepiscoporum; magistri Pandulfi domini pape subdiaconi et familiaris,\r\nfratris Aymerici magistri milicie Templi in Anglia; et nobilium virorum\r\nWillelmi Mariscalli comitis Penbrocie, Willelmi comitis Sarresburie,\r\nWillelmi comitis Warennie, Willelmi comitis Arundellie, Alani de\r\nGaleweya constabularii Scocie, Warini filii Geroldi, Petri filii\r\nHereberti, Huberti de Burgo senescalli Pictavie, Hugonis de Nevilla,\r\nMathei filii Hereberti, Thome Basset, Alani Basset, Philippi de\r\nAlbiniaco, Roberti de Roppeleia, Johannis Mariscalli, Johannis filii\r\nHugonis et aliorum fidelium nostrorum.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 322:\r\n\r\n  The division of Magna Carta into a preamble and sixty-three chapters\r\n  is a modern device, for convenience of reference, for which there is\r\n  no warrant in the Charter itself.

Cf. what is said of “peerage” under cc.\r\n  14 and 39.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Great Charter of John opens, in the form common to all royal\r\ncharters of the period, with a greeting from the sovereign to his\r\nmagnates, his officials, and his faithful subjects, and announces, in\r\nthe pious legal formula used by impious and pious kings alike, that he\r\nhad made certain grants by the advice of those counsellors whom he\r\nnames. Three features of this preamble call for comment.\r\n\r\nI. _The King’s Title._ Some points of interest are suggested by the form\r\nof the royal style adopted by John, which is connected by an unbroken\r\nthread of development with that of William I. on the one hand, and of\r\nHis Majesty, Edward VII., on the other. John’s assumption of the royal\r\nplural “_Sciatis Nos_” reads, in the light of subsequent history, as a\r\ntribute to his arrogance rather than to his greatness, when compared\r\nwith the humbler first person singular consistently used by his more\r\ndistinguished father. In this particular, however, Richard, not John,\r\nhad been the innovator on the usage of Henry II.[325] For a further\r\nalteration in the royal style John was alone responsible. To the titles\r\nborne by his father and brother, John invariably added that of “lord of\r\nIreland,” a reminiscence of his youth. When the wide territories of\r\nHenry II., had been distributed among his elder sons, the young John\r\n(hence known as “John Lackland”) was left without a heritage, until his\r\nfather bestowed on him the island of Ireland, recently appropriated; and\r\nthis brought with it the right to style himself “_dominus Hibernie_.”\r\nThis title of his younger days was not unnaturally retained by him after\r\nhe had outlived all his brothers and inherited their wide lands and\r\nhonours.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 325:\r\n\r\n  Coke (_Second Institute_, pp. 1-2) is here in error; he makes John the\r\n  innovator.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nJohn began his reign in 1199 as ruler over the undivided possessions of\r\nthe House of Anjou at their widest stretch, extending without a break,\r\nother than the waters of the Channel, from the Cheviots to the Pyrenees.\r\nThese lands were held by John, as by his father, under a variety of\r\ntitles and conditions. Anjou, the original home and fief of the\r\nhot-blooded Plantagenet race, still carried with it only the modest rank\r\nof count. In addition to this paternal title, Henry II. had, at an early\r\nage, become duke of Normandy in his mother’s right, and thereafter duke\r\nof Aquitaine by marriage with Eleanor, its heiress. These three great\r\nfiefs were held by Henry and his sons under the king of France as their\r\nlord paramount. Long before 1215, John’s bad fortune or incompetence had\r\nlost to him these wide continental dominions except the most distant of\r\nthem all, his mother’s dowry of Aquitaine. His ancestral domains of\r\nAnjou and Normandy had been irretrievably lost, but he still retained\r\ntheir empty titles; and in this his son Henry III. followed him,\r\ngrasping the shadow long after the substance had fled. Entries relating\r\nto Gascony frequently appear on the Rolls of Parliament of Edward I.;\r\nand the kings of England were styled dukes of Aquitaine, dukes of\r\nGuienne, or dukes of Gascony (the three descriptions being used\r\nindifferently) until Edward III. merged all these titles in a wider one,\r\nwhen he claimed the throne of France.\r\n\r\nEngland alone, of John’s possessions, real and nominal, was held by the\r\nhigher style of “_Rex_,” implying strictly sovereign rule, independent\r\nof any overlord, and retained by John in 1215 in spite of his recent\r\nacceptance of Innocent III. as feudal overlord. Of Ireland, John was\r\nstill content to describe himself, as formerly, “lord,” not king. The\r\nexact meaning of the word “_Dominus_” in medieval charters, particularly\r\nin those of Stephen, has been made the subject of much learned\r\ncontroversy; which has not yet resulted in a consensus of opinion as to\r\nthe technical meaning, if any, borne by the word.[326] “_Dominus_,”\r\nindeed, seems to have been loosely used wherever something of substance\r\nor of ceremonial was lacking from the full sovereignty implied in the\r\nmore specific name of king. In this connection much stress was laid on\r\nthe solemn sacrament of coronation, implying among other things formal\r\nconsecration by the church.[327]\r\n\r\nFootnote 326:\r\n\r\n  Various theories will be found in Round’s _Geoffrey de Mandeville_,\r\n  70; Dr. Rüssler’s _Matilde_, 291–4; and Ramsay’s _Foundations of\r\n  England_, II. 403.\r\n\r\nFootnote 327:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, p. 119.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nJohn’s connection with England, then, is expressed in two simple words,\r\n“_Rex Anglie_,” no explanation being vouchsafed of how he had acquired\r\nthis title. Such vindication, indeed, was not called for, as this was no\r\ncoronation charter, John having already reigned for fifteen years\r\nwithout any serious rival—the claims of Arthur, the son of his elder\r\nbrother Geoffrey, never having been taken seriously in England.[328] The\r\nsimple words, “_Dei gratia rex Anglie_,” may be contrasted with the\r\ndetailed titles set out in the coronation charters of Henry I. and\r\nStephen respectively. Henry I. in 1100 had emphasized his relationship\r\nto preceding kings, describing himself as “_Filius Willelmi regis post\r\nobitum fratris sui Willelmi, Dei gracia rex Anglorum_”;[329] while\r\nStephen in April, 1136, in his second and more deliberate charter, used\r\nan entirely different formula, “_Dei gracia assensu cleri et populi in\r\nregem Anglie electus, et a Willelmo Cantuarensi archiepiscopo et sancte\r\nRomane ecclesie legato consecratus, et ab Innocentio sancte Romane sedis\r\npontifice postmodum confirmatus_,”[330] the laboured nature of which\r\nbetrays the consciousness of weakness.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 328:\r\n\r\n  Geoffrey’s daughter Eleanor was in 1215, a prisoner in Corfe Castle.\r\n  See _infra_, c. 59.\r\n\r\nFootnote 329:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix.\r\n\r\nFootnote 330:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThus Henry I. and Stephen each laid stress on the strong points of his\r\ntitle and ignored its defects. These two claims of kingship express, in\r\na crude form, two rival theories of the title to the English Crown—(1)\r\nhereditary succession, and (2) election. Neither of these is an accurate\r\nreflection of the full theory and practice of the twelfth century, which\r\nblended both principles in proportions not easy to define with accuracy.\r\nProfessor Freeman has pushed to excess the supposed right of the\r\nWitenagemot to elect the king, and has transferred wholesale to the\r\nNorman _Curia_ (which, in some respects, took its place) all the powers\r\nenjoyed by its forerunner. A recent German writer, Dr. Oskar\r\nRössler,[331] has gone equally far in the opposite direction, flatly\r\ndenying that the Normans ever admitted the elective element at all. The\r\ntheory now usually held is a mean between these extremes, namely that\r\nthe Norman _Curia_ (or the chief magnates who usually composed it) had a\r\nlimited right of selecting among the sons, brothers, or near relations\r\nof the last king, the individual best suited to succeed him. Such a\r\nright, never authoritatively enunciated, gradually sank to an empty\r\nformality. Its place was taken, to some extent, by the successful\r\nassertion by the spiritual power (usually represented by the archbishop\r\nof Canterbury), of a claim to give or withhold the consecrating oil\r\nwhich accompanied the church’s blessing. Without this no _dominus_ could\r\nbe recognized as _rex_. On this theory the descriptions of their own\r\ntitles given by Henry I. and Stephen were alike incomplete: each ignored\r\nthe facts which did not suit him. John, on the contrary, secure in\r\npossession, condescends on no particulars, but contents himself with the\r\nterse assertion of the fact of his kingship: “_Johannes, dei gratia, Rex\r\nAnglie_.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 331:\r\n\r\n  _Matilde_, _passim_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nII. _The Names of the Consenting Nobles._ It was natural that the\r\nCharter should place formally on record the assent of those counsellors\r\nwho attended John when he made terms with his enemies, of those magnates\r\nwho remained in at least nominal allegiance, and were therefore capable\r\nof acting as the mediators by whose good offices peace was for a time\r\nrestored.[332] The leading men in England during this crisis may be\r\narranged in three groups: (1) the leaders of the great host openly\r\nopposed to John at Runnymede; (2) the agents of John’s oppressions,\r\nextreme men, mostly aliens, many of whom were in command of royal\r\ncastles or of mercenary levies ready to take the field; and (3) moderate\r\nmen, mostly churchmen or John’s ministers or relations, who, whatever\r\ntheir sympathies might be, remained in allegiance to the king and helped\r\nto arrange terms of peace—a comparatively small band, as the paucity of\r\nnames recited in Magna Carta testifies.[333] The men, here made\r\nconsenters to John’s grant of Magna Carta, are again referred to, though\r\nnot by name, in chapter 63, in the character of witnesses.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 332:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, I. 582, gives the motive of thus naming\r\n  them as “the hope of binding the persons whom it includes to the\r\n  continued support of the hard-won liberties.” Those named were all\r\n  moderate men. M. Paris (_Chron. Maj._ II., 589) describes them as\r\n  “_quasi ex parte regis_,” while Ralph of Coggeshall (p. 172) narrates\r\n  how “by the intervention of the Archbishop of Canterbury, with a few\r\n  of his bishops and some barons, a kind of peace was made.” Cf. _Annals\r\n  of Dunstable_, III. 43. The neutrality of the prelates is proved by\r\n  other evidence. (_a_) C. 62 gave them authority to certify by letters\r\n  testimonial the correctness of copies of the Charter. (_b_) The 25th\r\n  of the Articles of the Barons left to their decision whether John\r\n  should enjoy a crusader’s privileges; while c. 55 gave Langton a\r\n  special place in determining what fines were unjust. (_c_) The Tower\r\n  of London was placed in the custody of the archbishop as a neutral man\r\n  whom both sides could trust. (_d_) Copies are preserved of two\r\n  protests on different subjects by the prelates in favour of the king.\r\n  See Appendix.\r\n\r\nFootnote 333:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, 43–4, and for biographical information see authorities\r\n  there cited.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIII. _The Reasons of the Grant._ The preamble contains also a statement\r\nof what purport to be John’s reasons for conceding the Charter. These\r\nare quaintly paraphrased by Coke:[334] \"Here be four notable causes of\r\nthe making of this great charter rehearsed. 1. The honour of God. 2. For\r\nthe health of the King’s soul. 3. For the exaltation of holy church, and\r\nfourthly, for the amendment of the Kingdom.\" The real reason must be\r\nsought in another direction, namely, in the army of the rebels; and John\r\nin after days did not scruple to plead consent given under threat of\r\nviolence, as a reason for voiding his grant. The technical legal\r\n“consideration,” the _quid pro quo_ which John received as the price of\r\nthis confirmation of their liberties was the renewal by his opponents of\r\nthe homage and fealty which they had solemnly renounced. This\r\n“consideration” was not stated in the charter, but the fact was known to\r\nall.[335]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 334:\r\n\r\n  _Second Institute_, 1, n.\r\n\r\nFootnote 335:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, 41.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER ONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn primis concessisse Deo et hac presenti carta nostra confirmasse, pro\r\nnobis et heredibus nostris in perpetuum, quod Anglicana ecclesia libera\r\nsit, et habeat jura sua integra, et libertates suas illesas; et ita\r\nvolumus observari; quod apparet ex eo quod libertatem electionum, que\r\nmaxima et magis necessaria reputatur ecclesie Anglicane, mera et\r\nspontanea voluntate, ante discordiam inter nos et barones nostros motam,\r\nconcessimus et carta nostra confirmavimus, et eam obtinuimus a domino\r\npapa Innocencio tercio confirmari; quam et nos observabimus et ab\r\nheredibus nostris in perpetuum bona fide volumus observari.[336]\r\nConcessimus eciam omnibus liberis hominibus regni nostri, pro nobis et\r\nheredibus nostris in perpetuum, omnes libertates subscriptas, habendas\r\net tenendas eis et heredibus suis, de nobis et heredibus nostris.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 336:\r\n\r\n  Some editions of the Charter place here the division between c. 1 and\r\n  c. 2.\r\n\r\n  In the first place we have granted to God, and by this our present\r\n  charter confirmed for us and our heirs for ever that the English\r\n  church shall be free, and shall have her rights entire, and her\r\n  liberties inviolate; and we will that it be thus observed; which is\r\n  apparent from this that the freedom of elections, which is reckoned\r\n  most important and very essential to the English church, we, of our\r\n  pure and unconstrained will, did grant, and did by our charter confirm\r\n  and did obtain the ratification of the same from our lord, Pope\r\n  Innocent III., before the quarrel arose between us and our barons, and\r\n  this we will observe, and our will is that it be observed in good\r\n  faith by our heirs for ever. We have also granted to all freemen of\r\n  our kingdom, for us and our heirs forever, all the underwritten\r\n  liberties, to be had and held by them and their heirs, of us and our\r\n  heirs forever.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis first of the sixty-three chapters of Magna Carta here places side\r\nby side, bracketed equal as it were, (_a_) a general confirmation of the\r\nprivileges of the English national church, and (_b_) a declaration that\r\nthe various civil rights to be afterwards specified in detail were\r\ngranted “to all freemen” of the kingdom and to their heirs for ever. The\r\nmanner of this juxtaposition of the church’s rights with the lay rights\r\nof freemen, suggests an intention to make it clear that neither group\r\nwas to be treated as of more importance than the other. If the civil and\r\npolitical rights of the nation at large occupy the bulk of the Charter,\r\nand are defined in their minutest details, the church’s rights, of which\r\nno mention whatever had been made in the Articles of the Barons, receive\r\nhere a prior place.[337] A twofold division thus suggests itself.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 337:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, p. 50.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI. _The rights of the National Church._ A general promise that the\r\nEnglish church should be free was accompanied by a special confirmation\r\nof the separate charter recently granted guaranteeing freedom of\r\ncanonical election. (1) _Quod Anglicana ecclesia libera sit._ This\r\nemphatic, if vague declaration, which has no counterpart in the Articles\r\nof the Barons, is repeated twice in Magna Carta, each time in a\r\nprominent position, at the beginning and the end respectively. If the\r\nwork of the barons showed no special tenderness for churchmen’s\r\nprivileges, Stephen Langton and his bishops were careful to have that\r\ndefect remedied in the formal document by which John expressed his final\r\nconsent. In extorting this promise of a “free” English church, the\r\nprelates seem to have been satisfied that they need ask for nothing\r\nmore; the other particulars in which the Charter differs from its draft\r\nshow no trace of clerical bias. The phrase used, indeed, was deplorably\r\nvague and elastic; it scarcely needed stretching to cover the widest\r\nencroachments of clerical arrogance. Yet the formula was by no means a\r\nnew one; Henry I. and Stephen had successively confirmed the claim of\r\nholy church to its freedom.[338]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 338:\r\n\r\n  See these charters in Appendix.\r\n\r\nHenry II. was careful to avoid making any such promises: his whole reign\r\nwas an effort, not unsuccessful in spite of the terrible disadvantage at\r\nwhich he was placed by the murder of Becket, to deprive the church of\r\nwhat her leaders considered her legitimate “freedom.” John in 1215,\r\nhowever, receded from the ground occupied by his father, confirming by\r\nthe Great Charter the promise given by the weakest of his Norman\r\npredecessors, in a phrase repeated in all subsequent confirmations.\r\n\r\nIt by no means follows that “freedom of the church,” as promised by\r\nStephen, meant exactly the same thing as “freedom of the church”\r\npromised by John and his successors.[339] The value to be attached to\r\nsuch assurances varied in inverse ratio to the strength of the kings who\r\nmade them, and this is well illustrated by a comparison of the charters\r\nof Henry I., Stephen, and John. Henry qualifies the phrase by words\r\nwhich illustrate if they do not limit its application. God’s holy church\r\nwas to be free “_so that_ I shall neither sell nor let to farm, nor on\r\nthe death of archbishop, bishop, or abbot, accept anything from the\r\ndemesne of the church or from its tenants, until his successor has\r\nentered into possession.”[340] This suggests a somewhat narrow\r\ninterpretation of the church’s freedom—exemption mainly from the\r\niniquities of Rufus. Stephen’s charter, on the contrary, explains or\r\nsupplements the same phrase by definite declarations that the bishops\r\nshould have sole jurisdiction over churchmen and their goods, and that\r\nall rights of wardship over church lands were renounced, thus making it\r\na “large and dangerous promise.”[341]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 339:\r\n\r\n  It is perhaps worthy of note that while the charters of Henry I. and\r\n  Stephen spoke only of “holy church,” John speaks of the “English\r\n  church.” This change suggests a growth of patriotism among the\r\n  prelates, led by Stephen Langton.\r\n\r\nFootnote 340:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, 117.\r\n\r\nFootnote 341:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Pollock and Maitland, I. 74.\r\n\r\n“Freedom of the church” had thus come in 1136 to include “benefit of\r\nclergy” in a specially sweeping form, and much besides.[342] It is easy\r\nto understand why churchmen cherished an elastic phrase which, wide as\r\nwere the privileges it already covered, might readily be stretched\r\nwider. Laymen, on the contrary, contended for a more restrictive\r\nmeaning; and the Constitutions of Clarendon must be viewed primarily as\r\nan attempt to arrive at definite conclusions on disputed points of\r\ninterpretation. Henry II. substantially held his ground, in spite of his\r\nnominal surrender after Becket’s murder. Thanks to his firmness, \"the\r\nchurch’s freedom\" shrank to more reasonable proportions, so that the\r\nwell-known formula, when repeated by John, was emptied of much of the\r\ncontent found in it by Stephen’s bishops. If it still implied “benefit\r\nof clergy” that phrase was now read in a more restricted sense, while\r\nwardship over vacant sees was expressly reserved to the Crown by John.\r\nChapter 18 of Magna Carta accepted, apparently with the approval of all\r\nclasses, the principle that questions of church patronage (assizes of\r\ndarrein presentment)[343] should be settled before the King’s Justices,\r\na concession to the civil power inconsistent with the more extreme\r\ninterpretations formerly put by churchmen on the phrase.[344]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 342:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, 120–1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 343:\r\n\r\n  For explanation see _infra_, c. 18.\r\n\r\nFootnote 344:\r\n\r\n  On the other hand c. 22, which lays down special rules for the\r\n  amercement of beneficed clerks, to that extent confirmed class\r\n  privileges of the clergy.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn later reigns the pretensions of the church to privileged treatment\r\nwere gradually reduced to narrow bounds, and the process of compression\r\nwas facilitated by that very elasticity on which the clergy had relied\r\nas being favourable to the expansion of their claims. It was the civil\r\ngovernment which benefited in the end from the vagueness of the words in\r\nwhich Magna Carta declared _quod Anglicana ecclesia libera sit_.[345]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 345:\r\n\r\n  Mr. J. H. Round (_Geoffrey de Mandeville_, 3), speaking of Stephen’s\r\n  “oath” to restore the church her “liberty,” describes this as “a\r\n  phrase the meaning of which is well known.” If “well” known, it was\r\n  known chiefly as something vague, something which baffled definition,\r\n  because churchmen and laymen could never agree as to its contents,\r\n  while it tended also to vary from reign to reign. Mr. Round attempts\r\n  no definition. Sir James Ramsay (_Angevin Empire_, p. 475), writing of\r\n  the phrase as used in John’s Charter, is less prudent. \"It would\r\n  relieve the clergy of all lay control, and of all liability to\r\n  contribute to the needs of the State beyond the occasional scutages\r\n  due from the higher clergy for their knights’ fees.\" This definition\r\n  assuredly would not have satisfied Henry I., as a legitimate\r\n  interpretation of the words as used by him in his Charter of\r\n  Liberties.\r\n\r\n(2) _Canonical election._ A separate charter to the national church had\r\nbeen granted on 21st November, 1214, and re-issued on 15th January,\r\n1215.[346] Its tenor may be given in three words, “freedom of election.”\r\nIn all cathedral and conventual churches and monasteries, the\r\nappointment of prelates was to be free from royal intervention for the\r\nfuture, provided always that licence to fill the vacancy had first been\r\nasked of the king. Now, _in words_, this was no new concession, but\r\nmerely a confirmation of the Concordat arrived at long before between\r\nHenry I. and archbishop Anselm as a solution of the rival claims of\r\nChurch and State in the election of bishops and abbots.[347] The essence\r\nof that arrangement had been to vest solely in the canons of the chapter\r\nof the vacant diocese the nominal right to appoint the new bishop,\r\nsubject, however, to the actual election taking place in the royal court\r\nor chapel—so that the king, being present, might endeavour to prevent\r\nthe appointment of any churchman he objected to. The result had not been\r\nwhat Anselm and the papal court expected; Henry I. and his successors\r\nstrenuously used or abused the influence thus reserved to them: none but\r\nroyal favourites were ever appointed, and the nominally free canonical\r\nelection became a sham. Churchmen had long desired to remedy this:\r\nLangton saw his opportunity, and on 21st November, 1214, secured from\r\nKing John, so far as mere words could secure anything, that the right of\r\nelection by the canons of the chapter should henceforth be transformed\r\nfrom a pretence into a reality. The bishops present at Runnymede used\r\ntheir influence to have a distinct confirmation of this recent\r\nconcession inserted in the very forefront of Magna Carta.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 346:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, p. 39. The text will be found in _Statutes of the Realm_,\r\n  I. 5, and in _New Rymer_, I. 126-7. It was confirmed by Innocent on\r\n  30th March, 1215. See Potthast, _Regesta pontificum romanorum_, No.\r\n  4963.\r\n\r\nFootnote 347:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, p. 22.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTheir forethought was insufficient permanently to prevent royal\r\ninfluence from bending canonical election to its will. Henry III.,\r\nindeed, in his reissues was made to repeat the phrase _quod Anglicana\r\necclesia libera sit_, but omitted all reference alike to canonical\r\nelection and to the charters of 21st November, 1214, and 15th January,\r\n1215. Later in his reign, he took advantage of this, with the Pope’s\r\nconnivance or support, to reduce again the rights of cathedral chapters\r\nin the appointment of bishops to the sinecure they had been before.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Henry III. was prone, alike by nature and from policy,\r\nto lean on the papal arm, and that the _Curia_ at Rome rather than the\r\n_Curia Regis_ for a time dominated the appointment to vacant sees. Henry\r\nand Innocent IV. indeed formed a tacit alliance for dividing all fat\r\nlivings among their respective creatures, king’s men or pope’s men, who\r\nhad little interest in England or its welfare. Edward I., impatient of\r\nforeign dictation as he was, had to submit to a partial continuance of\r\n“provisions” for hangers-on of the papacy in his insular domains; but\r\nthe national church had little to gain. The canons elected the nominee\r\nof king or pope, as each was, for the moment, in the ascendant.[348]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 348:\r\n\r\n  Cf _supra_, p. 167.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAn interesting, if purely academic, question might be raised as to how\r\nfar the rights guaranteed by Magna Carta to the English church were\r\nmeant to imply freedom from papal as well as from royal interference. It\r\nis clear that the movement which culminated in the charter of 21st\r\nNovember, 1214, originated in England, not at Rome; and apparently\r\nNicholas, the papal legate at that date, opposed the endeavours of\r\nStephen Langton to obtain it. The archbishop indeed looked upon the\r\nlegate as the chief obstacle to the reform by the king of the grievances\r\nof the national church.[349] In spite of Magna Carta, then, the\r\nindependence of the national church retrograded, rather than advanced,\r\nduring the long alliance between Henry III. and the successive occupants\r\nof the papal throne.[350]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 349:\r\n\r\n  See Miss Norgate, _John Lackland_, p. 208, and authorities there\r\n  cited.\r\n\r\nFootnote 350:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Prothero, _Simon de Montfort_, p. 152. “The English church was\r\n  indeed less independent of the king in 1258 than in 1215, and far less\r\n  independent of the Pope than in the days of Becket.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nII. _Civil and Political Rights._ After providing thus briefly for the\r\nchurch, chapter one proceeds to give equal prominence, but at greater\r\nlength, to the grant or confirmation of secular customs and liberties.\r\nThis takes here the form of a general enacting clause, leaving details\r\nto be specified in the remaining sixty-two chapters of the Charter. Some\r\nof the more important points involved have already been discussed in the\r\nHistorical Introduction—for example, the feudal form of the grant,\r\nbetter suited, according to modern ideas, to the conveyance of a\r\nspecific piece of land, than to the securing of the political and civil\r\nliberties of a mighty nation; and the vexed question as to what classes\r\nof Englishmen were intended, under the description of “freemen,” to\r\nparticipate in these rights.[351]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 351:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, pp. 128-9 and 141-2. For the meaning of “freeman” and\r\n  Coke’s inclusion of villeins under that term for some purposes but not\r\n  for others, see _infra_, cc. 20 and 39.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAnother interesting point, though of minor importance, calls for\r\nseparate treatment. John does not state that his grants of civil and\r\npolitical rights had been made spontaneously. Whether deliberately or\r\nnot, there is here a marked distinction between the phraseology applied\r\nto secular and to ecclesiastical rights respectively. While the\r\nconcessions to churchmen are said to have been granted “_mera et\r\nspontanea voluntate_,” no such statement is made about the concessions\r\nto the freemen. John may have favoured this omission as strengthening\r\nhis contention that the Great Charter had been sealed by him under\r\ncompulsion. In the third re-issue of Henry III. (1225) this defect was\r\nremedied—the words “_spontanea et bona voluntate nostra_” being used in\r\nits preamble.[352] Some importance seems to have been attributed to this\r\naddition, which formed the essence of a concession bought by the\r\nsurrender of one-fifteenth of the moveable property of all estates of\r\nthe realm.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 352:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, p. 181.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\n\r\nSi quis comitum vel baronum nostrorum, sive aliorum tenencium de nobis\r\nin capite per servicium militare, mortuus fuerit, et cum decesserit\r\nheres suus plene etatis fuerit et relevium debeat, habeat hereditatem\r\nsuam per antiquum relevium; scilicet heres vel heredes comitis de\r\nbaronia comitis integra per centum libras; heres vel heredes baronis de\r\nbaronia integra per centum libras; heres vel heredes militis de feodo\r\nmilitis integro per centum solidos ad plus; et qui minus debuerit minus\r\ndet secundum antiquam consuetudinem feodorum.\r\n\r\n  If any of our earls or barons, or others holding of us in chief by\r\n  military service shall have died, and at the time of his death his\r\n  heir shall be of full age and owe “relief,” he shall have his\r\n  inheritance on payment of the ancient relief, namely the heir or heirs\r\n  of an earl, £100 for a whole earl’s barony; the heir or heirs of a\r\n  baron, £100 for a whole barony; the heir or heirs of a knight, 100s.\r\n  at most for a whole knight’s fee; and whoever owes less let him give\r\n  less, according to the ancient custom of fiefs.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll preliminaries concluded, the Charter at once attacked what was, in\r\nthe barons’ eyes, the chief of John’s abuses, his arbitrary increase of\r\nfeudal obligations. The Articles of the Barons, indeed, had plunged at\r\nonce into this most crucial question without a word by way of pious\r\nphrases or legal formulae, such as were necessary in a regular Charter.\r\n\r\nI. _Assessment of Beliefs._ Each “incident” had its own special\r\npossibilities of abuse, and the Great Charter deals with each of these\r\nin turn. The present chapter defines the reliefs to be henceforth paid\r\nto John.[353] The vagueness of the sums at first was a natural corollary\r\nof the early doubts as to whether the hereditary principle was\r\nabsolutely binding or not. The heir with title not yet recognized was\r\nkeen to come to terms. The lord took as much as he could grind from the\r\ninexperience or timidity of the youthful heir; the heir tried to profit\r\nfrom the good nature or temporary embarrassments of the lord. All was\r\nvague; and such vagueness favoured the strongest or most wily.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 353:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, p. 73.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nA process of definition, however, was early at work; and progressed,\r\nthough slowly. Public opinion set limits of variation, to go beyond\r\nwhich was considered unreasonable or even indecent. Some conception of a\r\n“reasonable relief” was evolved. Yet the criterion varied: the Crown\r\nmight defy rules binding on others. Henry I., indeed, when bidding\r\nagainst duke Robert in 1099 for the throne showed himself willing, in\r\nwords if not in practice, to accept the limits set by contemporary\r\nopinion. His Charter of Liberties promised that all reliefs should be\r\n_justa et legitima_—an elastic phrase no doubt, and one in after days\r\nliberally interpreted by the exchequer officials in their royal master’s\r\nfavour. By the end of the twelfth century, when Glanvill wrote, the\r\nexact sums which could be taken by mesne lords had been fixed; although\r\nthe Crown remained free to exact higher rates. _Baroniae capitales_, he\r\ntells us, were charged relief, not at a fixed rate, but at sums which\r\nvaried _juxta voluntatem et misericordiam domini regis_.[354]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 354:\r\n\r\n  Glanvill’s words (IX. c. 4) are unfortunately ambiguous. He\r\n  distinguishes three cases: (_a_) the normal knight’s fee, from which\r\n  100s. was due as relief (whether this extends to fees of crown tenants\r\n  does not appear); (_b_) socage lands, from which one year’s rent might\r\n  be taken; and (_c_) “_capitales baroniae_,” which were left subject to\r\n  reliefs at the king’s discretion. Now “barony” was a loose word:\r\n  baronies, like barons, might be small or great (cf. _infra_, c. 14);\r\n  all crown fiefs being “baronies” in one sense, but only certain larger\r\n  “honours” being so reckoned in another. Glanvill leaves this vital\r\n  point undetermined, but evidence from other sources makes it probable\r\n  that even smaller crown holdings should for this purpose be classed\r\n  under his _capitales baroniae_, and not with knights’ fees held from\r\n  mesne lords. Two passages from the _Dialogus de Scaccario_ (II. x. E.\r\n  p. 135 and II. xxiv. p. 155) clearly support the distinction between\r\n  all crown tenants (small as well as great) on the one hand, and\r\n  tenants of mesne lords on the other: only the latter had their reliefs\r\n  fixed, while the former were at the king’s discretion. (The second\r\n  passage shows how the exchequer officials held the onus of proof to\r\n  lie on the heir to a crown fief to show that he was worthy to succeed\r\n  his father, and suggests rich gifts to the king as the best form of\r\n  proof.) Madox (I. 315-6) cites from the Pipe Rolls large sums exacted\r\n  by the crown. Usually the number of knights’ fees paid for is not\r\n  specified, but in one case a relief of £300 was paid for six fees—that\r\n  is, at the rate of £50 per fee, or exactly ten times what a mesne lord\r\n  could have exacted. (See Pipe Roll, 24 Henry II., cited by Madox,\r\n  _ibid._) There is further evidence to the same effect: where a barony\r\n  had escheated to the crown, reliefs of the former under-tenants would\r\n  in future be payable directly to the crown; but it was the practice of\r\n  Henry II. (confirmed by c. 43 of Magna Carta, _q. v._) to charge, in\r\n  such cases, only the lower rates exigible prior to the escheat. A\r\n  similar rule applied to under-tenants of baronies in wardship; see the\r\n  case of the knights of the see of Lincoln in the hands of a royal\r\n  warden in Pipe Roll, 14 Henry II. (cited by Madox, _ibid._). It would\r\n  thus appear that all holders of crown fiefs (not merely _barones\r\n  majores_) were in Glanvill’s day still liable to arbitrary extortions\r\n  in name of reliefs. The editors of the _Dialogus_ (p. 223) are also of\r\n  this opinion. Pollock and Maitland (I. 289), however, maintain the\r\n  opposite view—namely, that the limitation to 100s. per knight’s fee\r\n  was binding on the crown as well as on mesne lords.\r\n\r\nEvery year, however, made for definition; and custom pointed with\r\nincreasing authority towards 100s. per knight’s fee, and £100 for a\r\nbarony. Two entries on the Pipe Roll of 10 Richard I. amusingly\r\nillustrate the unsettled practice. A sum of £100 is described as a\r\n“reasonable relief” for a barony, and immediately this entry is\r\nstultified by a second entry of a considerable additional payment by way\r\nof “fine” to induce the king to accept the sum his own roll had just\r\ndeclared “reasonable.”[355] John was more openly regardless of reason.\r\nThe Pipe Roll of 1202 shows how an unfortunate heir failed to get his\r\nheritage until he paid 300 marks, with the promise of an annual\r\n“acceptable present” to the king.[356]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 355:\r\n\r\n  Madox, I. 316.\r\n\r\nFootnote 356:\r\n\r\n  Madox, I. 317.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIf John could ask so much, what prevented him asking more? He might name\r\na prohibitive price, and so defeat the hereditability of fiefs\r\naltogether. Such arbitrary exactions must end, so the barons were\r\ndetermined in 1215; custom must be defined, so as to prevail henceforth\r\nagainst royal discretion. The first demand of the Articles of the Barons\r\nis, “that heirs of full age shall have their heritage by the ancient\r\nrelief to be set forth in the Charter.” Here it is, then, duly set forth\r\nand defined in chapter 2 of Magna Carta as £100 for an \"earl’s barony,\"\r\n£100 for \"a baron’s barony,\" 100s. for a knight’s fee, and a\r\nproportional part of 100s. for every fraction of a knight’s fee. This\r\nclause produced the desired effect. These rates were strictly observed\r\nby the exchequer of Henry III., as we know from the Pipe Rolls of his\r\nreign. Thus, when a certain William Pantoll was charged with £100 for\r\nhis relief on the mistaken supposition that he held a “barony,” he\r\nprotested that he held only five knight’s fees, and got off with the\r\npayment of £25.[357] The relief of a barony was subsequently reduced\r\nfrom £100 to 100 marks. The date of this change, if we may rely on\r\nMadox,[358] lies between the twenty-first and thirty-fifth years of\r\nEdward I.[359]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 357:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, I. 318.\r\n\r\nFootnote 358:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, I. 321.\r\n\r\nFootnote 359:\r\n\r\n  The first of the long series of charters and confirmations which\r\n  contains it seems to be the _Inspeximus_ of 10th October, 1297, which\r\n  in all probability merely recognized officially a rule long demanded\r\n  as simple justice by the barons and public opinion. (See Madox, I.\r\n  318, Pollock and Maitland, I. 289, and Bémont, _Chartes_, p. 47.)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nApparently all who paid reliefs to the king were mulcted in a further\r\npayment (calculated at 9 per cent. of the relief) in name of \"Queen’s\r\nGold,\" a contribution to the private purse of the Queen Consort, and\r\ncollected by an official specially representing her at the\r\nexchequer.[360]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 360:\r\n\r\n  See note by editors of _Dialogus_, p. 238. The Petition of the Barons\r\n  in 1258 (_Sel. Charters_, 382) protested against this, and the\r\n  practice was discontinued.\r\n\r\nThe Charter deals only with tenure by knight’s service; nothing is said\r\nof other tenures. The explanation of the omission may possibly be\r\ndifferent in the cases of socage and of serjeanty respectively.[361]\r\n(_a_) _Socage._ The barons were not so vitally interested in socage,\r\nthat being, in the normal case, the tenure of humbler men.[362] In later\r\nreigns the king, like an ordinary mesne lord, contented himself with one\r\nyear’s rent of socage lands in name of relief. (_b_) _Serjeanty._ The\r\nbarons cannot have been indifferent to the fate of serjeanties, since\r\nmany of them held great estates by such tenures. Possibly they assumed\r\nthat the rules applied to knights’ fees and baronies would apply to\r\nserjeanties as well. The Crown, however, acted on a different view;\r\nlarge sums were frequently extorted by Henry III. By the reign of Edward\r\nI., however, the practice of the exchequer was to limit itself to one\r\nyear’s rent (a sufficiently severe exaction)[363] for serjeanties, which\r\nthus fell into line with socage.[364]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 361:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, pp. 66-9.\r\n\r\nFootnote 362:\r\n\r\n  It is possible to argue that the custom as to socage was already too\r\n  well settled to require any confirmation. Glanvill (IX. c. 4) stated\r\n  the relief for socage at one year’s annual value. It is not absolutely\r\n  clear, however, whether this restriction applied to the crown.\r\n  Further, no custom, however well established, was sufficiently safe\r\n  against John’s greed, to make confirmation unnecessary.\r\n\r\nFootnote 363:\r\n\r\n  See Littleton, _Tenures_, II. viii., s. 154, and Madox, I. 321, who\r\n  cites the case of a certain Henry, son of William le Moigne, who was\r\n  fined in £18 for the relief of lands worth £18 a year held \"by the\r\n  serjeanty of the King’s Lardinary.\"\r\n\r\nFootnote 364:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, p. 69.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nII. _Units of Assessment._ Some explanation is required of the three\r\ngroups into which crown estates were thus divided—knight’s fees, barons’\r\nbaronies, and earls’ baronies.\r\n\r\n(1) _Feodum militis integrum._ The origin of the knight’s fee is\r\nobscured by a network of conflicting theories. A thread of connection is\r\nsometimes traced between it and the mysterious five-hide unit of\r\nAnglo-Saxon times; other authorities would ascribe its introduction into\r\nEngland to a definite act of some great personage—either William the\r\nConqueror, according to Selden, who founds on a well-known but\r\nuntrustworthy passage in Ordericus Vitalis, or Ranulf Flambard,\r\naccording to Freeman, Stubbs, and Gneist. It seems probable that the\r\nNormans, here as elsewhere, pursued their policy of avoiding an open\r\nrupture with the past, and that the Conqueror adapted as far as possible\r\nthe existing system of land tenure to his own needs. There is little\r\ndoubt, in light of the evidence accumulated by Mr. Round in his _Feudal\r\nEngland_, that William I. stipulated verbally for the service of a\r\ndefinite number of knights from every fief bestowed by him on his Norman\r\nfollowers. A knight’s fee or _scutum_ thus became a measure of military\r\nservice, and of feudal assessment; _servitium unius militis_ was a\r\nwell-known legal unit. But a difficult problem arises when it is asked\r\nwhat definite equation, if any, existed between land and service. Three\r\nanswers have been given: (_a_) A definite ratio exists between amount of\r\nservice and extent of ground. In other words, the knight’s fee contains\r\na fixed area of land; every five hides sent one warrior, thus preserving\r\nthe old Anglo-Saxon unit.[365] (_b_) The ratio lies not between service\r\nand extent, but between service and value. An estate of £20 annual\r\nrental sends one knight to the king’s wars; the normal knight’s fee\r\ncontains 20 librates of land.[366] (_c_) Other authorities deny that any\r\nproportion exists at all: William the Conqueror exacted from each of his\r\ngrantees precisely as much or as little knight’s service as he saw fit.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 365:\r\n\r\n  C. Pearson, _Hist. of Engl._, I. 375, note 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 366:\r\n\r\n  J. H. Round, _Feudal England_, 295.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIs it not possible to reconcile these divergent conclusions? Undoubtedly\r\nthe Conqueror held himself bound by no fixed rules, but made exceptions\r\nwhere he pleased: some favoured foundations were exempt from all service\r\nwhatsoever.[367] Yet, if he distributed estates at his own free will, he\r\ndid not necessarily distribute them irrationally or at random. He\r\ndemanded service of knights in round numbers, 5 or 10 or 20, as he saw\r\ncause, and in normal cases he was guided by some loose sense of\r\nproportion. Where there was no reason either for preferential treatment\r\nor for special severity, service would be roughly proportionate either\r\nto the area or to the value. This rule was William’s servant, not his\r\nmaster, and was made to yield to many exceptions, which would amply\r\naccount for the existence in later days of knight’s fees varying from 2\r\nhides to 14 hides, instead of the normal 5.[368] Each such fee, whatever\r\nits acreage or its rental, owed the service of one knight, and paid\r\nrelief at 100s.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 367:\r\n\r\n  _E.g._ Gloucester and Battle Abbeys: see Round, _ibid._, 299.\r\n\r\nFootnote 368:\r\n\r\n  See Round, _Feudal England_, 294, and Pollock and Maitland, I. 235.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(2) _Baronia integra._ The word “barony” cannot be easily defined, on\r\naccount of the many changes it has undergone.[369] A “barony” at the\r\nNorman Conquest differed in almost every respect from a “barony” at the\r\npresent day. The word _baro_ was originally synonymous with _homo_,\r\nmeaning, in feudal usage, a vassal of any lord. It soon became usual,\r\nhowever, to confine the word to king’s men; “_barones_” were thus\r\nidentical with \"crown tenants\"—a considerable body at first; but a new\r\ndistinction soon arose between the great men and the smaller men among\r\ntheir number (between _barones majores_ and _barones minores_). The\r\nlatter were usually called knights (_milites_), while “baron” was\r\nreserved for the holder of an “honour.”[370] For determining what\r\nconstituted an “honour,” however, it was impossible to lay down any\r\nabsolute criterion. Mere size was not sufficient: a magnate once classed\r\nas a full “baron” might successfully claim to be only a “knight,” thus\r\nlightening some of his feudal burdens, for example this one of\r\n“reliefs.” Chapter 14 of Magna Carta helped to stereotype the division,\r\nsince it stipulated that each _major baro_ should receive an individual\r\nwrit of summons to the Council, leaving the _barones minores_ to be\r\nconvened collectively through the sheriff. As the one point of\r\ncertainty, where everything else was vague, these writs came to possess\r\nan exaggerated importance, and it was finally held (at a date long\r\nsubsequent to Magna Carta) that the mere receipt of a special summons,\r\nif acted upon, made the recipient a baron, and entitled his heirs, in\r\nall time coming, to succeed him in what was fast hardening into a\r\nrecognized title of dignity. The “barons” in 1215 knew nothing of all\r\nthis; they desired merely to have the reliefs due by them taxed at a\r\nfixed rate. Each “barony” should pay £100, a sum afterwards reduced to\r\n100 marks.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 369:\r\n\r\n  See Pollock and Maitland, I. 262, and authorities there cited. “An\r\n  honour or barony is thus regarded as a mass of lands which from of old\r\n  have been held by a single title.” An exact definition is, perhaps,\r\n  impossible: the term was first applied in early days without any\r\n  technical meaning; in later days each “honour” had separately\r\n  established its position by prescriptive usage. See also Pike, _House\r\n  of Lords_, pp. 88-9, on the difficulty of defining “an entire barony.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 370:\r\n\r\n  This change was not complete in 1215, but Magna Carta, when it uses\r\n  “_barones_” alone, seems to refer to “_barones majores_” only (see cc.\r\n  2, 21, 61). In c. 14, “_barones majores_” are contrasted with\r\n  “_barones minores_.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nRelief was thereafter a fixed sum, while the size of the barony varied\r\nin each case. As the same holds true of the knight’s fee, it is doubly\r\nridiculous to attempt to discover an equation between the knight’s fee\r\nand the barony founded upon the ratio of the sums payable. Coke,\r\nhowever, was guilty of this absurdity.[371]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 371:\r\n\r\n  See Coke on _Littleton_, II. iv. s. 112, and _ibid._ _Second\r\n  Institute_, p. 7. Founding on the later practice of the exchequer,\r\n  which exacted one hundred marks of relief from a barony, and one\r\n  hundred shillings from a knight’s fee, he assumed the false equation\r\n  \"1 barony = 13⅓ knight’s fees.\" If he had known of the earlier\r\n  practice, which followed the rule of John’s Charter, he might have\r\n  jumped to another equation, equally false, namely that \"1 barony = 20\r\n  knight’s fees.\" There is, in reality, no fixed proportion between the\r\n  two, either as to extent or value.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(3) _Baronia comitis integra._ A peculiar phrase is used in the text, an\r\n\"earl’s barony\" appearing where “earldom” might be expected.[372] The\r\nreason is that “earldom” originally implied the holding of an office and\r\nnot the ownership of land, whereas relief was payable for the earl’s\r\nlands or “honour,” not for his office. The Charter, therefore, uses\r\nwords well fitted to make its meaning clear. The earl (or _comes_) was\r\nthe successor of the ealdorman as local governor of a county or group of\r\ncounties. His title was official, not tenurial, or even, in early times,\r\nnecessarily hereditary.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 372:\r\n\r\n  In the _Inspeximus_ of Edward I., however, the word _comitatus_\r\n  (earldom) displaces the _baronia comitis_ of the text. See _Statutes\r\n  of Realm_, I. 114.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSome of the ideas most intimately connected with a modern earldom were\r\nsignally inappropriate to the Norman earls. At the present day an\r\nearldom is one of several “steps in the peerage,” a conception that did\r\nnot then exist. At the present day it carries with it a seat in the\r\nHouse of Lords, whereas no instance is recorded until long after the\r\nNorman Conquest of any earl or other great man demanding as a right to\r\nbe present in the king’s council: the custom of summoning all crown\r\ntenants became stereotyped only in the reign of Henry II. and was not\r\nformally recognized previous to chapter 14 of Magna Carta. At the\r\npresent day, again, the hereditary principle is the chief feature of an\r\nearldom, whereas William did not admit that the office necessarily\r\npassed from father to son.[373]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 373:\r\n\r\n  See Pike, _House of Lords_, 57.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Conqueror had been to bring each county as far as\r\npossible under his own direct authority; many districts had no earls,\r\nwhile in others the connection of an earl with his titular shire was\r\nreduced to a shadow, the only points of connection being the right to\r\nenjoy “the third penny” (that is, the third part _pro indiviso_ of the\r\nprofits of justice administered in the county court) and the right to\r\nbear its name. It is true that in addition the earl usually held\r\nvaluable estates in the shire, but he did this only as any other\r\nlandowner might. For purposes of taxation the whole of his lands,\r\nwhether in his own county or elsewhere, were reckoned as one unit, here\r\ndescribed as _baronia comitis integra_, the relief on which was taxed at\r\none hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nVery gradually in after ages, the conception of an earldom suffered\r\nchange. The official character gave way before the idea of tenure, and\r\nlater on the modern conception was formulated of a hereditary dignity\r\nconferring specific rank and privileges. The period of transition when\r\nthe tenurial idea prevailed is illustrated by the successful attempt of\r\nRanulf, earl of Chester and Lincoln, in the reign of Henry III. to\r\naliene one of his two earldoms—described by him as the _comitatus_ of\r\nLincoln.[374] Earls are now, like barons, created by letters patent, and\r\nneed not be land-owners. Thus the words “barony” and “earldom,” so\r\ndiverse in their origin and early development, were closely united in\r\ntheir later history.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 374:\r\n\r\n  See Pike, _House of Lords_, 63. This term _comitatus_ was a word of\r\n  many meanings. Originally designating the “county” or “the county\r\n  court,” it came to mean also the office of the earl who ruled the\r\n  county, and later on it might indicate, according to context, either\r\n  his titular connection with the shire, his estates, his share of the\r\n  profits of justice, or his rank in the peerage.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIII. _Liability of Church Property to “Relief.”_ The Great Charter of\r\nJohn, unlike the Charter of Henry I. makes no mention of the lands of\r\nvacant sees in this connection, probably because the main question had\r\nlong been settled in favour of the church. The position of a bishopric\r\nwas, however, a peculiar one. Each prelate was a crown tenant, and his\r\nfief was reckoned a “barony,” entitling its owner to all the privileges,\r\nand saddling him with all the feudal obligations of a baron.[375]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 375:\r\n\r\n  This was specially affirmed in 1164 by article 11 of the Constitutions\r\n  of Clarendon, which stipulated that each prelate should hold his lands\r\n  _sicut baroniam_, merely a restatement of existing law.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt was not then unnatural that, when a prelate died, the Crown should\r\ndemand “relief” from his successor, in the same way as from the heir of\r\na dead lay baron. Such demands, when made by William Rufus and his\r\nminister Flambard, met with bitter opposition. The Crown in consequence,\r\nunwilling to forego any of its feudal dues, endeavoured to shift their\r\nincidence from the revenues of the see to the shoulders of the feudal\r\nunder-tenants. After bishop Wulfstan’s death on 18th January, 1095, a\r\nwrit was issued in William’s name to the freeholders of the see of\r\nWorcester, calling on each of them to pay, as a relief due on their\r\nbishop’s death, a specified sum, assessed by the barons of the\r\nexchequer.[376]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 376:\r\n\r\n  _Sicut per barones meos disposui._ The writ is given in Heming’s\r\n  _Cartulary_, I. 79-80, and reprinted by Round, _Feudal England_, 309.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn revenge for such extortions from church lands and tenants, the\r\nhistorians of the day, all necessarily recruited from the clerical\r\nclass, have heartily recommended Rufus and Flambard to the opprobrium of\r\nposterity. Anselm compelled Henry I. to promise amendment in his\r\ncoronation Charter, which undertook to exact nothing during vacancies\r\neither from the demesne of the church or from its tenants.[377] No\r\ncorresponding promise was demanded from John, a proof that such\r\nexactions had ceased. The Crown no longer extorted relief from church\r\nlands, although wardship was, without protest, enforced during\r\nvacancies.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 377:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSi autem heres alicujus talium fuerit infra etatem et fuerit in\r\ncustodia, cum ad etatem pervenerit, habeat hereditatem suam sine relevio\r\net sine fine.\r\n\r\n  If, however, the heir of any one of the aforesaid has been under age\r\n  and in wardship, let him have his inheritance without relief and\r\n  without fine when he comes of age.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crown is here forbidden to exact relief where it had already enjoyed\r\nwardship. It was hard on the youth, escaping from leading-strings, to be\r\nmet, when he “sued out his livery,” with the demand for a large relief\r\nby the exchequer which had already appropriated all his available\r\nrevenue. The same event, namely, the ancestor’s death, was thus made the\r\nexcuse for two distinct feudal incidents.[378]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 378:\r\n\r\n  Where there had already been a wardship, the relief was thus the price\r\n  paid by the heir in order to escape from the heavy hand of the king,\r\n  and was therefore known as “_ousterlemain_.” Mr. Taswell-Langmead\r\n  (_Engl. Const. Hist._, p. 51, n.) states the amount at half a year’s\r\n  profits. He cites no authorities for this, and is probably in error.\r\n  The _Dialogus_, II. x. E., p. 135, forbids relief to be taken, when\r\n  wardship had been exercised _per aliquot annos_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSuch double extortion had long been forbidden to mesne lords; Magna\r\nCarta was merely extending similar limitations to the king. The\r\ngrievance complained of had been intensified by an unfair expedient\r\nwhich John sometimes adopted. In cases of disputed succession he\r\nfavoured the claims of a minor, enjoyed the wardship, and thereafter\r\nrepudiated his title altogether, or confirmed it only in return for an\r\nexorbitant fine. The only safeguard was to provide that the king should\r\nnot enjoy wardship until he had allowed the heir to perform homage,\r\nwhich constituted the binding tie of lord and vassal between them,\r\nprevented the king from challenging the vassal’s right, and bound him to\r\n“warrant” the title against all rival claimants. This expedient was\r\nactually adopted in the revised Charter of 1216.[379]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 379:\r\n\r\n  See chapter 3 of 1216, which stipulates that no lord shall have\r\n  wardship of an heir “_antequam homagium ejus ceperit_.” Cf. Coke,\r\n  _Second Institute_, p. 10.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe alterations in that reissue were not altogether in the vassal’s\r\nfavour. Another addition made a reasonable stipulation in favour of the\r\nlord, which incidentally illustrates the theory underlying wardship. The\r\nessence of tenure in chivalry was the grant of land in return for\r\nmilitary services. Only a knight was capable of bearing arms; hence it\r\nwas that the lord held the lands in ward until the minor should reach\r\nman’s estate. Ingenious attempts had apparently been made to defeat\r\nthese legitimate rights of feudal lords by making the infant heir a\r\n“knight,” thus cutting away the basis on which wardship rested. The\r\nreissue of 1216 prevented this, providing that the lands of a minor\r\nshould remain in wardship, although he was made a knight.[380]\r\nIncidentally, the same Charter of Henry declared twenty-one years to be\r\nthe period at which a military tenant came of age, a point on which\r\nJohn’s Charter had been silent.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 380:\r\n\r\n  Coke, _ibid._, p. 12, makes a subtle, and apparently unwarranted,\r\n  distinction to depend on whether the minor was made a knight before or\r\n  after his ancestor’s death. The proviso, he argues, does not apply to\r\n  the former case, because the word used is “_remaneat_,” and lands\r\n  cannot “remain” in wardship if they were not in it before. Such\r\n  reasoning is puerile.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn one case, exceptionally, wardship and relief might both be exacted on\r\naccount of the same death, though not by the same lord. Where the dead\r\nman had formerly held two estates, one of the Crown and one of a mesne\r\nlord, the Crown might claim the wardship of both, and then the\r\ndisappointed mesne lord was allowed to exact relief as a solatium for\r\nhis loss.[381]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 381:\r\n\r\n  See _Coke on Littleton_, Book II. c. iv. s. 112; and cf. _infra_, cc.\r\n  37 and 43 for the “prerogative wardship” of the Crown.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nCustos terre hujusmodi heredis qui infra etatem fuerit, non capiat de\r\nterra heredis nisi racionabiles exitus, et racionabiles consuetudines,\r\net racionabilia servicia, et hoc sine destructione et vasto hominum vel\r\nrerum; et si nos commiserimus custodiam alicujus talis terre vicecomiti\r\nvel alicui alii qui de exitibus illius nobis respondere debeat, et ille\r\ndestructionem de custodia fecerit vel vastum, nos ab illo capiemus\r\nemendam, et terra committatur duobus legalibus et discretis hominibus de\r\nfeodo illo, qui de exitibus respondeant nobis vel ei cui eos\r\nassignaverimus; et si dederimus vel vendiderimus alicui custodiam\r\nalicujus talis terre, et ille destructionem inde fecerit vel vastum,\r\namittat ipsam custodiam, et tradatur duobus legalibus et discretis\r\nhominibus de feodo illo qui similiter nobis respondeant sicut predictum\r\nest.\r\n\r\n  The guardian of the land of an heir who is thus under age, shall take\r\n  from the land of the heir nothing but reasonable produce, reasonable\r\n  customs, and reasonable services, and that without destruction or\r\n  waste of men or goods; and if we have committed the wardship of the\r\n  lands of any such minor to the sheriff, or to any other who is\r\n  responsible to us for its issues, and he has made destruction or waste\r\n  of what he holds in wardship, we will take of him amends, and the land\r\n  shall be committed to two lawful and discreet men of that fee, who\r\n  shall be responsible to us for the issues, or to him to whom we shall\r\n  assign them; and if we have given or sold the wardship of any such\r\n  land to someone and he has therein made destruction or waste, he shall\r\n  lose that wardship, and it shall be transferred to two lawful and\r\n  discreet men of that fief, who shall be responsible to us in like\r\n  manner as aforesaid.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis chapter and the next treat of wardship,[382] a much hated feudal\r\nincident, which undoubtedly afforded openings for grave abuses. It is a\r\nmistake, however, to regard its mere existence as an abuse: it seems to\r\nhave been perfectly legal in England from the date of the Norman\r\nConquest, although some writers[383] consider it an innovation devised\r\nby William Rufus and Flambard, without precedent in the Conqueror’s\r\nreign. The chief argument for this mistaken view is that Henry I., in\r\npromising redress of several admitted inventions of Rufus, promised also\r\nto reform wardship. This may show that wardship was abused, but does not\r\nprove it an innovation.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 382:\r\n\r\n  The nature of wardship is more fully explained _supra_, pp. 75-7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 383:\r\n\r\n  _E.g._ Mr. Taswell-Langmead, _Engl. Const. History_, p. 51, n.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Charter of Henry committed him undoubtedly to drastic remedies,\r\nwhich would have amounted to the virtual abolition of wardship\r\naltogether. Chapter 4 of that document removed from the lord’s custody\r\nboth the land and the person of the heir, and gave them to the widow of\r\nthe deceased tenant (or to one of the kinsmen, if such kinsman had, by\r\nancient custom, rights prior to those of the widow).[384] This was only\r\none of the many insincere promises which the “lion of justice” never\r\nkept, and probably never meant to keep. Wardship continued to be exacted\r\nfrom lay fiefs throughout the reigns of Henry I. and Stephen. Article 4\r\nof the Assize of Northampton (1176) merely confirmed the existing\r\npractice when it allowed wardship to the lord of the fee.[385] The\r\nbarons in 1215 made no attempt to alter this, or to revert to the\r\ndrastic remedies of the Charter of Henry I., although the evils\r\ncomplained of had become worse under John’s misgovernment.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 384:\r\n\r\n  “This, it would seem, was the old English rule”; see Ramsay,\r\n  _Foundations of England_, II. 230.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that “wardship” placed the property and person of\r\nthe heir at the mercy of the Crown. Even if the popular belief as to the\r\nfate met by Prince Arthur at his uncle’s hands was unfounded, John was\r\nby no means the guardian to inspire confidence in the widowed mother of\r\na young Crown tenant whose estates the king might covet for himself.\r\nFurther, the king might confer the office, with the delicate issues\r\ninvolved, upon whomsoever he would. When such a trust was abused it was\r\ndifficult to obtain redress. In 1133 a guardian, accused _de puella quam\r\ndicitur violasse in custodia sua_, paid a fine to the crown, if not as\r\nhush money, at least in order to obtain protection from being sued\r\nelsewhere than in the _Curia Regis_.[386] It is easy to understand how\r\nthoroughly this feudal incident must have been detested in England and\r\nNormandy, all the more so if, as Hallam contends, it was not recognized\r\nas a feudal due in other parts of Europe.[387]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 385:\r\n\r\n  It is a common error to suppose that this Assize restores wardship to\r\n  the lord.\r\n\r\nFootnote 386:\r\n\r\n  See _Pipe Roll_, 29 Henry II., cited Madox, I. 483.\r\n\r\nFootnote 387:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, p. 78.\r\n\r\nGuardians were of two kinds. The king might entrust the lands to the\r\nsheriff of the county where they lay (or to one of his bailiffs), such\r\nsheriff drawing the revenues on the Crown’s behalf, and accounting in\r\ndue season at the exchequer. Alternatively, the king might make an\r\nout-and-out grant of the office, together with all profit to be derived\r\nfrom it, to a private individual, either some royal favourite or the\r\nbidder of the highest price. Commentators of a later date[388] apply the\r\nword “committee” to the former type of guardian, reserving “grantee” for\r\nthe latter. This distinction, which is mentioned by Glanvill,[389]\r\nobtains recognition in this passage of the Charter. Neither was likely\r\nto have the interests of the minor at heart. Both would extort the\r\nmaximum of revenue, the one for the king, the other for himself. They\r\nhad always strong inducements to exhaust the soil, stock, and timber,\r\nuprooting and cutting down whatever would fetch a price, and replacing\r\nnothing. The heir found too often a wilderness of impoverished lands and\r\nempty barns.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 388:\r\n\r\n  _E.g._ Coke, _Second Institute_, p. 13.\r\n\r\nFootnote 389:\r\n\r\n  VII. c. 10.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe remedies proposed by Magna Carta were too timid and half-hearted;\r\nyet something was effected. It was unnecessary to repeat the recognized\r\nrule that the minor must receive, out of the revenues of the land,\r\nmaintenance and education suited to his station; but the Crown was\r\nrestrained by chapter 3 from exacting relief where wardship had already\r\nbeen enjoyed; chapter 37 forbade John to exact wardship in certain cases\r\nwhere it was not legally due; while here in chapter 4 an attempt was\r\nmade to protect the estate from waste.\r\n\r\nThe promised reforms included a definition of “waste”; punishment of the\r\nwasteful guardian; and protection against repetition of the abuse. Each\r\nof these calls for comment. (1) _The definition of waste._ The Charter\r\nuses the words “_vastum hominum vel rerum_” (a phrase which occurs also\r\nin Bracton).[390] It is easy to understand waste of goods; but what is\r\n\"waste of men\"? An answer may be found in the words of the so-called\r\n“unknown Charter of Liberties,”[391] which binds guardians to hand over\r\nthe land to the heir “_sine venditione nemorum et sine redemptione\r\nhominum_.” Clearly, to enfranchise villeins was one method of “wasting\r\nmen.” The young heir, when he came to the enjoyment of his estates, must\r\nnot find his praedial serfs emancipated.[392] The words of the “unknown\r\nCharter” may be used to illustrate the text, even if it be a forgery,\r\nsince a consensus of opinion holds it to be either contemporary or of\r\nslightly later date.[393]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 390:\r\n\r\n  II. folio 87.\r\n\r\nFootnote 391:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix.\r\n\r\nFootnote 392:\r\n\r\n  Another way of “wasting” villeins was by tallaging them excessively.\r\n  (For meaning of tallage cf. _infra_ c. 12.) Thus Bracton’s _Note Book_\r\n  reveals how one guardian _destruxit villanos per tallagia_ (_v._ case\r\n  485); how another exiled or destroyed villeins to the value of 300\r\n  marks (case 574); how a third destroyed two rich villeins so that they\r\n  became poor and beggars and exiles (case 632). Cf. also case 691.\r\n  Daines Barrington, writing towards the middle of the eighteenth\r\n  century, went too far when he inferred from this passage “that the\r\n  villeins who held by servile tenure were considered as so many negroes\r\n  on a sugar plantation” (_Observations_, p. 7.). For a definition of\r\n  “villein” see _infra_ c. 20.\r\n\r\nFootnote 393:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, pp. 202-5.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(2) _The punishment of wasteful guardians._ The Charter provides a\r\ndistinct but appropriate form of punishment for each of the two types of\r\nguardian. John promises to take “amends,” doubtless of the nature of a\r\nfine, from the “committee” who had no personal interest in the property;\r\nwhile the “grantee” is to forfeit the guardianship, thus losing a\r\nvaluable asset for which he had probably paid a high price, sufficient\r\npunishment, perhaps, without the exaction of damages.\r\n\r\nSubsequent statutes did not, however, take so lenient a view. While the\r\nStatute of Westminster[394] merely repeated the words of Magna Carta,\r\nthe Statute of Gloucester[395] enacted that the grantee who had\r\ncommitted waste should not only lose the custody, but should, in\r\naddition, pay to the heir any balance between the value of the wardship\r\nthus forfeited and the total damage. More severe penalties were found\r\nnecessary. Statute 36 Edward III. chapter 13 enacted that the king’s\r\nEscheators (officers who first became prominent towards the close of the\r\nreign of Henry III., and who acted in the normal case as guardians of\r\nCrown wards), when guilty of waste, should “yield to the heir treble\r\ndamages.” If the boy was still a minor, his friends might bring a suit\r\non his behalf; or after he was of full age he might bring it on his own\r\naccount.[396]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 394:\r\n\r\n  3 Edward I. c. 21.\r\n\r\nFootnote 395:\r\n\r\n  6 Edward I. c. 5.\r\n\r\nFootnote 396:\r\n\r\n  Coke, _Second Institute_, p. 13, enunciates a doctrine at variance\r\n  with this statute, holding that the heir who suffered damage could\r\n  not, on coming of age, obtain such triple damages, or indeed any\r\n  damages at all, if the king had previously taken amends himself. Coke\r\n  further maintains that even after waste had been committed, the person\r\n  of the heir was left in the power of the unjust guardian, explaining\r\n  that when the Charter took away the office “this is understood of the\r\n  land, and not of the body.” There seems, however, to be no authority\r\n  for such statements.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(3) _Provision against a recurrence of the waste._ It was only fair that\r\nreasonable precautions should be taken to prevent the heir who had\r\nalready suffered hurt, from being similarly abused a second time. John,\r\naccordingly, promised to supersede the keeper guilty of waste by\r\nappointing as guardians two of the most trustworthy of the free-holders\r\non the heir’s estate. These men, from their local and personal ties to\r\nthe young heir, might be expected to deal tenderly with his property.\r\nThe “unknown Charter,” already referred to, proposed a more drastic\r\nremedy. Whenever the Crown’s right to a wardship opened, the lands were\r\nto be entrusted to four knights of the fief without waiting until damage\r\nhad been done. This suggestion, if carried out, would have protected the\r\nking’s wards, without injury to the legitimate pecuniary interests of\r\nthe Crown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nCustos autem, quamdiu custodiam terre habuerit, sustentet domos, parcos,\r\nvivaria, stagna, molendina, et cetera ad terram illam pertinencia, de\r\nexitibus terre ejusdem; et reddat heredi, cum ad plenam etatem\r\npervenerit, terram suam totam instauratam de carrucis et waynagiis,\r\nsecundum quod tempus waynagii exiget et exitus terre racionabiliter\r\npoterunt sustinere.\r\n\r\n  The guardian, moreover, so long as he has the wardship of the land,\r\n  shall keep up the houses, parks, places for live-stock,[397]\r\n  fishponds, mills, and other things pertaining to the land, out of the\r\n  issues of the same land; and he shall restore to the heir, when he has\r\n  come to full age, all his land, stocked with ploughs and implements of\r\n  husbandry, according as the season of husbandry shall require, and the\r\n  issues of the land can reasonably bear.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 397:\r\n\r\n  _Vivarium_ in strictness means a place for keeping live-stock, but\r\n  probably included the animals also. By Coke, in the _Statutes at\r\n  large_, and elsewhere, it is translated “warren”; but that word has\r\n  its Latin form in _warrena_. Stubbs’ Glossary to _Select Charters_ (p.\r\n  551) renders it as “a fish pond,” but _stagnum_ has that meaning. The\r\n  Statute Westminster II. (c. 47) speaks of _stagnum molendinæ_ (a\r\n  mill-pond). The Statute of Merton (c. 11) refers to poachers taken _in\r\n  parcis et vivariis_; while Westminster I. (c. 1) forbids _ne courge en\r\n  autri parks, ne pesche en autri vivers_, which suggests a change of\r\n  connotation. Cf. _ibid._, c. 20.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThese stipulations form the complement, on the positive side, of the\r\npurely negative provisions of chapter 4. It was not sufficient to\r\nprohibit acts of waste; the guardian must see that the estates were kept\r\nin good repair.\r\n\r\nI. _The Obligations of the Warden of a Lay-fief._ It was the duty of\r\nevery custodian to preserve the lands from neglect, together with all\r\nhouses, “parks” (a term explained under chapter 47), fishponds, mills,\r\nand the other usual items of the equipment of a medieval manor. All\r\noutlays required for these purposes formed, in modern language, a first\r\ncharge on the revenues of the estate, to be deducted before the balance\r\nwas appropriated by the “grantee,” or paid to the exchequer by the\r\n“committee.” It was the guardian’s duty, moreover, to restore the whole\r\nto the heir in as good condition as the produce of the land might\r\nreasonably permit. Henry’s Charters directed that the guardian should\r\nredeliver the land stocked with ploughs “and with all other appointments\r\nin at least as good condition as he received it.”[398]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 398:\r\n\r\n  Blackstone, _Great Charter_, lxxviii. considers this “an indulgence to\r\n  guardians, by only directing them to deliver up the land ... in as\r\n  good condition as they found it, not in as good as it would bear.”\r\n  Sometimes, the heir after coming of age, could not recover his lands\r\n  at all. The Statute of Marlborough (c. 16) gave such a ward a right to\r\n  a _mort d’ancestor_ (cf. _infra_, p. 325) against a mesne lord, but\r\n  apparently not against the Crown. The Statute of Westminster I. (c.\r\n  48) narrates that heirs were often carried off bodily to prevent them\r\n  raising actions against their guardians.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMagna Carta did not attempt to abolish wardship, which continued in full\r\nforce for many centuries, with only a few of its worst abuses somewhat\r\ncurtailed. The whole subject was regulated in 1549 by the Statute 32\r\nHenry VIII. c. 46, which instituted the Court of Wards and Liveries, the\r\nexpensive and dilatory procedure of which caused increasing discontent,\r\nuntil an order of both Houses of Parliament, dated 24th February, 1646,\r\nabolished it along with “all wardships, liveries, _primer seisins_, and\r\n_ouster les mains_.”[399] This ordinance was confirmed at the\r\nRestoration by the Statute 12 Charles II. c. 24.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 399:\r\n\r\n  See S. R. Gardiner, _Documents_, p. 207.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nII. _Wardships over Vacant Sees._ The church had its own grievances,\r\nalthough these took a different form. The Constitutions of\r\nClarendon[400] had stipulated that each great prelate should hold his\r\nCrown lands _sicut baroniam_; and this view ultimately prevailed. It\r\nfollowed that all appropriate feudal burdens affected church fiefs\r\nequally with lay fiefs. The lands which formed the temporalities of a\r\nsee were, however, in a peculiar position, being the property, not of an\r\nindividual, but of an undying corporation (to use the definite language\r\nof a later age). When one bishop or abbot died, a successor of suitable\r\nage and worth had at once to be appointed. A minority was thus\r\nimpossible, and therefore, so it might be argued, wardships could never\r\narise. Rufus objected to what he thought an unfair exemption from a\r\nrecognized feudal incident. Flambard devised an ingenious substitute for\r\nordinary wardships by keeping sees long vacant, and meantime taking the\r\nlands under the guardianship of the Crown. Such practices formed the\r\noriginal ground of quarrel between Anselm and Rufus. Henry I., while\r\nrenouncing by his Charter all pretensions to exact reliefs, retained his\r\nright of wardship, promising merely that vacant sees should neither be\r\nsold nor farmed out. Stephen went further, renouncing expressly all\r\nwardships over church lands; but Henry II. ignored this concession, and\r\nreverted to the practice of his grandfather. In his reign the wardship\r\nof the rich properties of vacant sees formed a valuable asset of the\r\nexchequer. During a vacancy the Crown drew not only the rents and issues\r\nof the soil, but also the various feudal payments which the\r\nunder-tenants would otherwise have paid to the bishop. The Pipe Roll of\r\n14 Henry II.[401] records sums of £30 and £20 paid into the exchequer by\r\ntwo tenants of the vacant see of Lincoln for six and four knight’s fees\r\nrespectively.[402]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 400:\r\n\r\n  Article 11: see _Select Charters_, 139.\r\n\r\nFootnote 401:\r\n\r\n  Cited by the editors of the _Dialogus_, p. 223.\r\n\r\nFootnote 402:\r\n\r\n  Cf. under c. 43 _infra_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe practice of Henry of Anjou was followed by his sons. John was\r\ncareful specially to reserve wardships over vacant sees even in that\r\nvery accommodating charter, dated 21st November, 1214, which surrendered\r\nthe right of canonical election to the national church. Stephen Langton\r\nhad either failed to force John to relinquish wardships or else\r\nconsidered such a concession unnecessary now that the king renounced his\r\nright to veto church appointments, since wardships over church lands\r\nwould become unprofitable if elections were never unduly delayed.\r\nWhatever the reason, the charter of 1214 did nothing to guard against\r\nthe abuse of wardships over church lands, and John’s Great Charter was\r\nequally silent.[403] The omission was supplied in 1216, when it was\r\ndirected that the provisions already made applicable to lay fiefs should\r\nextend also to vacant sees, with the added proviso that church wardships\r\nshould never be sold. The charter of Henry III. thus reverted to the\r\nexact position defined by the charter of Henry I. The lands of vacant\r\nsees might be placed under a “committee,” but never given to a\r\n“grantee,” to use Coke’s terms.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 403:\r\n\r\n  C. 46 (see _infra_) confirmed _barons_, who had founded abbeys, in\r\n  their rights of wardship over them during vacancies.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThese provisions were further supplemented by later acts. An Act of 14\r\nEdward III. (stat. 4, cc. 4 and 5) gave to the dean and chapter of a\r\nvacant see a right to the pre-emption of the wardship at a fair price.\r\nIf they failed to exercise this, the king’s right to appoint escheators\r\nor other keepers was confirmed, but under strict rules as to waste. This\r\nis a distinct confirmation of the king’s right to “commit” church lands,\r\nalthough the prohibitions against selling them or farming them out\r\nremained still in force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nHeredes maritentur absque disparagacione, ita tamen quod, antequam\r\ncontrahatur matrimonium, ostendatur propinquis de consanguinitate ipsius\r\nheredis.\r\n\r\n  Heirs shall be married without disparagement, yet so that before the\r\n  marriage takes place the nearest in blood to that heir shall have\r\n  notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crown’s right to regulate the marriages of wards had become an\r\nintolerable grievance. The origin of this feudal incident and its\r\nextension to male as well as female minors have been elsewhere\r\nexplained.[404] John made a regular traffic in the sale of wards—young\r\nmaids of fourteen and aged widows alike. No excuse would be accepted.\r\nThe Pipe Roll of John’s first year[405] records how the chattels of a\r\ncertain Alice Bertram were taken from her and sold because she refused\r\n“to come to marry herself” at the summons of the king. Only two\r\nexpedients were open to those who objected to mate for life with the men\r\nto whom John sold them. They might take the veil, become dead in law,\r\nand forfeit their fiefs to escape the burdens inherent in them. Only the\r\ncloister could afford them shelter; nowhere in the outer world were they\r\nsafe. The other way of escape was to outbid objectionable suitors. This\r\nwas not always possible, for John was predisposed to favour the suit of\r\nhis foreign gentlemen of fortune, thus befriending his creatures while\r\nadding to the slender number of personally loyal tenants-_in-capite_.\r\nJohn’s greed was insatiable, and brief entries in his Exchequer Rolls\r\ncondense the story of many a tragedy. In the first year of his reign the\r\nwidow of Ralph of Cornhill offered 200 marks, with three palfreys and\r\ntwo hawks, that she might not be espoused by Godfrey of Louvain, but\r\nremain free to marry whom she chose, and yet keep her lands. This was a\r\ncase of desperate urgency, since Godfrey, for love of the lady or of her\r\nlands, had offered 400 marks for her, if she could show no reason to the\r\ncontrary. It is satisfactory to learn that in this case the higher bribe\r\nwas refused, and the lady escaped.[406]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 404:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, 75–8.\r\n\r\nFootnote 405:\r\n\r\n  Cited Madox, I. 565.\r\n\r\nFootnote 406:\r\n\r\n  See _Rotuli de Oblatis et Finibus_, p. 37, and _Pipe Roll_, 2 John,\r\n  cited by Madox, I. 515.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSometimes John varied his practice by selling, not the woman herself,\r\nbut the _right_ to sell her. In 1203 Bartholomew de Muleton bought for\r\n400 marks the wardship of the lands and heir of a certain Lambert, along\r\nwith the widow, to be married to whom he would, yet so that she should\r\nnot be disparaged.[407]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 407:\r\n\r\n  _Pipe Roll_, 4 John, cited by Madox, I. 324.\r\n\r\nGreat stress was naturally placed on exemption from \"disparagement\"—that\r\nis, from forced marriage with one who was not an equal. When William of\r\nScotland, by the treaty of 7th February, 1212, conferred on John the\r\nright to marry Prince Alexander to whom he would, the qualification was\r\nexpressly stated, “but always without disparagement.”[408] Such a\r\nproviso was understood where not expressed, and formed apparently the\r\nonly restriction admitted by the Crown upon this prerogative. It is not\r\nsurprising, then, to find it specially confirmed in Magna Carta.\r\nThe Articles of the Barons had, indeed, demanded a further\r\nprotection—namely, that a royal ward should only be married _with the\r\nconsent_ of the next of kin. In our text this is softened down to the\r\nmere intimation of an intended marriage. The opportunity was thus\r\nafforded of protesting against an unsuitable match. Insufficient as the\r\nprovision was, it was entirely omitted from the reissues of Henry’s\r\nreign. The sale of heiresses went on unchecked.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 408:\r\n\r\n  See _infra_, c. 59.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMagna Carta made no attempt to define disparagement, but the Statute of\r\nMerton[409] gave two examples,—marriage to a villein or to a burgess.\r\nThis was not an exhaustive list. Littleton, commenting on this\r\nstatute,[410] adds other illustrations:—“as if the heir that is in ward\r\nbe married to one who hath but one foot, or but one hand, or who is\r\ndeformed, decrepit, or having an horrible disease, or else great and\r\ncontinual infirmity, and, if he be an heir male, married to a woman past\r\nthe age of child-bearing.” Plenty of room was left for forcing on a ward\r\nan objectionable husband or wife, who yet could not be proved to come\r\nwithin the law’s definition of “disparagement.” The barons argued in\r\n1258 that an English heiress was disparaged if married to anyone not an\r\nEnglishman by birth.[411]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 409:\r\n\r\n  20 Henry III. c. 6.\r\n\r\nFootnote 410:\r\n\r\n  _Tenures_, II. iv. s. 109.\r\n\r\nFootnote 411:\r\n\r\n  See Petition of Barons (_Sel. Charters_, 383). Gradually the\r\n  conception of disparagement was expanded, partly from the natural\r\n  development of legal principles and partly from the increased power\r\n  the nobility obtained of enforcing their own definitions upon the\r\n  king. Coke commenting on Littleton (Section 107) mentions four kinds\r\n  of disparagements: (1) _propter vitium animi_, _e.g._ lunatics and\r\n  others of unsound mind; (2) _propter vitium sanguinis_, villeins,\r\n  burgesses, sons of attainted persons, bastards, aliens, or children of\r\n  aliens; (3) _propter vitium corporis_, as those who had lost a limb or\r\n  were diseased or impotent; and (4) _propter jacturam privilegii_, or\r\n  such a marriage as would involve loss of “benefit of clergy.” The last\r\n  clause had no possible connection with the law as it stood in the\r\n  thirteenth century, but was founded on the fact that marriage with a\r\n  widow or widower was deemed by the Church in later days an act of\r\n  bigamy, and therefore involved loss of the benefit of clergy, until\r\n  this was remedied by the Statute 1 Edward VI. c. 12 (sect. 16).\r\n\r\nWas it in the power of the far-seeing father of a prospective heiress by\r\nmarrying her during his own life-time to render nugatory the Crown’s\r\nright to nominate a husband? Not entirely; for the Charter of Henry I.\r\n(even when renouncing the more oppressive practice of Rufus) reserved\r\nthe king’s right to be consulted by the barons before they bestowed the\r\nhand of female relations in marriage. Magna Carta is silent on the\r\npoint, and the presumption is that the existing law was to be\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nBracton[412] explains that law:—No woman with an inheritance could marry\r\nwithout the chief lord’s consent, under pain of losing such inheritance;\r\nyet the lord when asked was bound to grant consent, if he failed to show\r\ngood reasons to the contrary; he could not, however, be compelled to\r\naccept homage from an enemy or other unsuitable tenant. The Crown’s\r\nrights in such matters were apparently the same as those of any mesne\r\nlord.[413]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 412:\r\n\r\n  II. _folio_ 88.\r\n\r\nFootnote 413:\r\n\r\n  For further information on the age at which marriage could be tendered\r\n  to a ward, and the penalties for refusing, see Thomson, _Magna\r\n  Charta_, pp. 170-1.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nVidua post mortem mariti sui statim et sine difficultate habeat\r\nmaritagium et hereditatem suam, nec aliquid det pro dote sua, vel pro\r\nmaritagio suo, vel hereditate sua quam hereditatem maritus suus et ipsa\r\ntenuerint die obitus ipsius mariti, et maneat in domo mariti sui per\r\nquadraginta dies post mortem ipsius, infra quos assignetur ei dos sua.\r\n\r\n  A widow, after the death of her husband, shall forthwith and without\r\n  difficulty have her marriage portion and inheritance; nor shall she\r\n  give anything for her dower, or for her marriage portion, or for the\r\n  inheritance which her husband and she held on the day of the death of\r\n  that husband; and she may remain in the house of her husband for forty\r\n  days after his death, within which time her dower shall be assigned to\r\n  her.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo amount of forethought on the part of a Crown tenant, setting his\r\nhouse in order against his decease, could rescue his widow from the\r\nextremely unfortunate position into which his death would necessarily\r\nplunge her. He must leave her without adequate protection against the\r\ntyranny of the king, who might inflict terrible hardships by a harsh use\r\nof rights vested in him for the safeguard of the feudal incidents due to\r\nthe Crown as overlord. Newly deprived of her natural protector, she was\r\nunder the immediate necessity of conducting a series of delicate\r\nnegotiations with a powerful opponent fortified by prerogatives wide and\r\nvague. She might indeed, if deprived of her “estovers,” find herself for\r\nthe moment in actual destitution, until she had made her bargain with\r\nthe Crown; she had a right, indeed (under normal circumstances) to\r\none-third of the lands of her late husband (her _dos rationalis_) in\r\naddition to any lands she might have brought as a marriage portion, but\r\nshe could only enter into possession by permission of the king, who had\r\nprior claims to hers, and could seize everything by his prerogative of\r\nprimer seisin.[414] This chapter provides a remedy. Widows shall have\r\ntheir rights without delay, without difficulty, and without payment.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 414:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, 78–9.\r\n\r\nI. _The Widow’s Share of Real Estate._ Three words are used:—_dos_,\r\n_maritagium_, and _hereditas_.\r\n\r\n(1) _Dower._ A wife’s dower is the portion of her husband’s lands set\r\naside to support her in her widowhood. It was customary from an early\r\ndate for a bridegroom to make adequate provision for his bride on the\r\nday he married her. Such a ceremony, indeed, formed a picturesque\r\nfeature of the marriage rejoicings, taking place literally at the door\r\nof the church, as man and wife returned from the altar. The share of her\r\nhusband’s land thus set apart for the young wife was known as her _dos_\r\n(or dowry), and would support her if her husband died. In theory the\r\ntransaction between the spouses partook of the nature of a contract by\r\nwhich they arranged the extent of the provision to be given and\r\naccepted. The wife’s rôle, however, was a passive one; her concurrence\r\nwas assumed. Yet, if no provision was made at all, the law stepped in,\r\non the presumption that the omission had been unintentional on the\r\nhusband’s part, and fixed the dower at one-third of all his lands.[415]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 415:\r\n\r\n  See Pollock and Maitland, II. 422-3. The ceremony at the church door,\r\n  when resorted to, was no longer an opportunity of giving material\r\n  proof of affection to a bride, but a means of cheating her out of what\r\n  the law considered her legitimate provision, by substituting something\r\n  of less value.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nJohn’s Magna Carta contents itself with the brief enactment “that a\r\nwidow shall have her dower.” The Charter of 1217 goes farther,\r\ncontaining an exact statement of the law as it then stood:—\"The widow\r\nshall have assigned to her for her dower the third part of all her\r\nhusband’s land which he had in his lifetime (_in vita sua_) unless a\r\nsmaller share had been given her at the door of the church.\" Lawyers of\r\na later age have by a strained construction of the words _in vita sua_,\r\nmade them an absolute protection to a wife against all attempts of her\r\nhusband to defeat or lessen her dower by alienations granted without her\r\nconsent during the subsistence of the marriage.[416] Magna Carta\r\ncontains no warrant for such a proposition, although a later clause\r\n(chapter 11) secures the dower lands from attachment by the husband’s\r\ncreditors, whether Jews or others.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 416:\r\n\r\n  Pollock and Maitland, II. 419.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(2) _Maritagium._ It was customary for a land-owner to bestow some share\r\nof his property as a marriage portion upon his daughters, that they\r\nmight not come to their husbands as empty-handed brides. The land so\r\ngranted was usually relieved from all burdens of service and homage. It\r\nwas hence known as _liberum maritagium_, which almost came to be\r\nrecognized as a separate form of feudal tenure. Grants for this purpose\r\ncould be made without the consent of the tenant’s expectant heirs,\r\nalthough early English law absolutely prohibited alienation of lands for\r\nany other purpose without their consent. _Maritagium_ was thus “a\r\nprovision for a daughter—or perhaps some other near kinswoman—and her\r\nissue.”[417] The husband of the lady was, during the marriage, treated\r\nas virtual owner for all practical purposes; but on his death the widow\r\nhad an indisputable title to lands brought with her “in free\r\nmarriage.”[418]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 417:\r\n\r\n  See Pollock and Maitland, II. 15-16.\r\n\r\nFootnote 418:\r\n\r\n  _Liberum maritagium_, considered as a tenure, has various\r\n  peculiarities. The lady’s husband became the feudal tenant of her\r\n  father. The issue of the marriage were heirs to the lands and would\r\n  hold them as tenants of the heir of the donor. For three generations,\r\n  however, neither service nor homage was due. After the third\r\n  transmission, the land ceased to be specially “free”; the peculiar\r\n  tenure came to an end; and the new owner was subject to all the usual\r\n  burdens of an ordinary tenant.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe obvious meaning, however, has not always been appreciated. Coke[419]\r\nreads the clause as allowing to widows of under-tenants a right denied\r\n(by chapter 8) to widows of Crown tenants—namely “freedom to marry where\r\nthey will without any licence or assent of their lords.” This\r\ninterpretation is inherently improbable, since the barons at Runnymede\r\ndesired to place restrictions on their enemy, the king, not upon\r\nthemselves; and it is opposed to the law of an earlier reign, as\r\nexpounded by Bracton.[420]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 419:\r\n\r\n  _Second Institute_, p. 16.\r\n\r\nFootnote 420:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, p. 253.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nDaines Barrington[421] invents an imaginary rule of law in order to\r\nexplain a supposed exception. An ordinary widow, he declares, could not\r\nin the normal case marry again before the expiry of a year after her\r\nfirst husband’s death. Some widows, however, were specially privileged.\r\n_Maritagium_ was a right conferred on widows of land-owners to cut short\r\nthe period of mourning imposed on others. This is a complete inversion\r\nof the truth; the possession of land always restricted, instead of\r\nextending, freedom of marriage. Several later authorities follow\r\nBarrington’s mistake.[422]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 421:\r\n\r\n  _Observations_, pp. 8-10.\r\n\r\nFootnote 422:\r\n\r\n  _E.g._ Thomson, _Magna Charta_, p. 172. Dr. Stubbs has his own reading\r\n  of _maritagium_, namely, “the right of bestowing in marriage a feudal\r\n  dependant.” See Glossary to _Sel. Charters_, p. 545. The word may\r\n  sometimes bear this meaning, but not in Magna Carta.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSuch mistakes when made by recent writers are the more inexcusable in\r\nview of the clear explanation given a century ago by John Reeves,[423]\r\nwho distinguished between two kinds of marriage portion: _liberum\r\nmaritagium_, whence no service whatever was exigible for three\r\ngenerations, and _maritagium servitio obnoxium_, liable to the usual\r\nservices from the first, although exempt from homage until after the\r\ndeath of the third heir.[424]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 423:\r\n\r\n  See his _History of English Law_, I. 121 (3rd ed.).\r\n\r\nFootnote 424:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _Ibid._ I. 242, where Reeves rightly points out that Coke is\r\n  mistaken, although he fails to notice the distinction drawn in the\r\n  passage criticized between the Crown and mesne lords.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(3) _Hereditas._ The first two words are thus readily understood: but\r\nwhat is _hereditas_? Is it simply another name for one of these, or is\r\nit something different? It is possibly used to denote estates acquired\r\nby the wife, not as a marriage portion, but in any other way, for\r\nexample by the opening of a succession on the death of someone, her\r\nfather or other relative, of whom she is the heir.\r\n\r\nII. _The Widow’s Share of Personal Estate._ The chapter of the Charter\r\nat present under discussion says nothing as to the widow’s right to any\r\nportion of her deceased husband’s goods and chattels. Chapter 26,\r\nhowever, confirms the existing law which secured to her, in the normal\r\ncase, one third of her husband’s personal estate, as will be more fully\r\nexplained hereafter.\r\n\r\nIII. _Provision for the Widow’s immediate Needs._ Many intricate\r\nquestions might arise before it was possible to divide the land into\r\naliquot portions and so “assign” the exact one-third due to her.\r\nMeanwhile, temporary provision must be made for her support. This was of\r\ntwo kinds: (1) _Quarantine._ Magna Carta confirmed her right to remain\r\nin the family home for a space of forty days. This was known to later\r\nlawyers as the widow’s quarantine.[425] The Charter of 1216 notes an\r\nexception to the general rule, on which John’s Charter is silent: if the\r\ndeceased husband’s chief place of residence had been a castle, the widow\r\ncould not stay there; feudal strongholds were not for women. In such\r\ncases, however, so the reissue of 1216 carefully provided, another\r\nresidence must be immediately substituted. In later days, widows\r\nunlawfully deprived of their quarantine were provided with a remedy by\r\nmeans of a writ, known as “_de quarentina habenda_,” directing the\r\nsheriff to take summary procedure to do her right.[426]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 425:\r\n\r\n  The “unknown charter” (see Appendix) specified sixty days, but Magna\r\n  Carta fixed the period at forty.\r\n\r\nFootnote 426:\r\n\r\n  See Coke, _Second Institute_, p. 16.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(2) _Estovers of Common._ The widow required something more than the\r\nprotection of a roof; for, until her dower lands had been delivered to\r\nher, no portion of the produce of her late husband’s manors could be\r\nstrictly called her own. The estate was held “in common” between her and\r\nher husband’s heir (or between her and the “guardian” of that heir’s\r\nestates). It was only fair that, until her rights were ascertained, she\r\nshould be allowed a reasonable share of the produce. Neither John’s\r\nCharter nor the first issue of Henry III. said anything on this head.\r\nThe reissue of 1217 supplied the omission, expressly confirming the\r\nwidow of a Crown tenant in the right to _rationabile estoverium suum\r\ninterim de communi_. Many explanations of the word _estovers_ (generally\r\nused in the plural) might be cited: from Dr. Johnson, who defines it\r\nbroadly as “necessaries allowed by law,” to Dr. Stubbs, who narrows it\r\nto “firewood.”[427] It was the right to use certain parts of the natural\r\nproduce of land or other property for the supply of one’s personal or\r\ndomestic wants. Such rights varied in extent, however; from the general\r\nright to a full supply of all things necessary for the maintenance of\r\nlife, down to the restricted right to take one kind of produce for one\r\nspecific purpose only.[428]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 427:\r\n\r\n  See Glossary to _Select Charters_, p. 539: “firewood; originally\r\n  provision or stuff generally.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 428:\r\n\r\n  Several instances of the wider use of the word may be given. Bracton\r\n  (III. _folio_ 137) explains that, pending the trial of a man accused\r\n  of felony, his lands and chattels were set aside by the sheriff until\r\n  it was determined whether they were to become the king’s property by\r\n  the conviction of the accused; meanwhile the imprisoned man and his\r\n  family out of the revenue received “reasonable estovers.” (Cf.\r\n  _infra_, c. 32.) The Statute of Gloucester (6 Edward I. c. 4) mentions\r\n  incidentally one method of stipulating for a return from property\r\n  alienated, viz., to take the grantee bound to provide the grantor in\r\n  estovers of meat or clothes. (“_A trouver estovers en vivre ou en\r\n  vesture_”). Blackstone again (_Commentaries_, I. 441) applies the name\r\n  _estovers_ to the alimony or allowance made to a divorced woman \"for\r\n  her support out of the husband’s estate.\" Sometimes, however, the word\r\n  was used in a more restricted sense. Coke (_Second Institute_, p. 17)\r\n  says, \"when _estovers_ are restrained to woods, it signifieth\r\n  housebote, hedgebote, and ploughbote,\"—that is, such timber as was\r\n  required for repairing houses, hedges, and ploughs. Apparently it had\r\n  an even more restricted scope when used to describe the right of those\r\n  who dwelt in the king’s forests, viz., to take dead timber as\r\n  firewood. (Cf. _infra_, c. 44.)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt seems natural to infer that in this passage of Magna Carta the word\r\nbears its wider signification. Such was Coke’s view,[429] who held that\r\nit implied the widow’s right to “sustenance” of every kind, including\r\nthe right to kill such oxen on the manor as she required for food.\r\nEstovers “of common” should thus be read as extending the widow’s right\r\nof consumption for her own and her household’s use over every form of\r\nproduce held “in common” by her and the heir’s guardian prior to a final\r\ndivision.[430]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 429:\r\n\r\n  _Second Institute_, p. 17.\r\n\r\nFootnote 430:\r\n\r\n  There seems no reason to restrict her estovers to a right over\r\n  “commons,” in the sense of pastures and woods held “in common” by her\r\n  late husband and the villeins of his manor. Some such meaning, indeed,\r\n  attaches to the phrase “dower of estovers” met with in later reigns,\r\n  _e.g._ in _Year Book_ of 2 Edward II. (Selden Society), p. 58, where\r\n  it was held that such a right (claimed as a permanent part of dower)\r\n  did _not_ belong to a widow.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nNulla vidua distringatur ad se maritandum dum voluerit vivere sine\r\nmarito; ita tamen quod securitatem faciat quod se non maritabit sine\r\nassensu nostro, si de nobis tenuerit, vel sine assensu domini sui de quo\r\ntenuerit, si de alio tenuerit.\r\n\r\n  Let no widow be compelled to marry, so long as she prefers to live\r\n  without a husband; provided always that she gives security not to\r\n  marry without our consent, if she holds of us, or without the consent\r\n  of the lord of whom she holds, if she holds of another.\r\n\r\n\r\nWealthy ladies, who were wise, were glad to escape with their children\r\nfrom John’s clutches by agreeing to buy up all the Crown’s oppressive\r\nrights for a lump sum. In the very year of Magna Carta, Margaret, the\r\nwidow of Robert fitz Roger, paid £1000;[431] and a few years earlier\r\nPetronilla, Countess of Leicester, expended as much as 4000 marks.[432]\r\nThough the circumstances of each of these cases seem to have been\r\npeculiar, the Pipe Rolls contain numerous smaller sums; in 1206 Juliana,\r\nwidow of John of Kilpec, accounts for 50 marks and a palfrey.[433]\r\nHorses, dogs, and falcons were frequently given in addition to money\r\nfines, and testify eloquently to the greed of the king, the anxiety of\r\nthe victims, and the extortionate nature of the whole system. In return,\r\nformal charters were usually obtained, a good example of which is one\r\ngranted to Alice, countess of Warwick, dated 13th January, 1205,[434]\r\ncontaining many concessions; among others that she should not be forced\r\nto marry; that she should be sole guardian of her sons; that she should\r\nhave one-third part of her late husband’s lands as her reasonable dower;\r\nand that she should be quit from attendance at the courts of the shire\r\nand of the hundred, and from payment of sheriff’s aids during her\r\nwidowhood. Another charter of 20th April, 1206, shows what a widow had\r\nto expect if she failed to make her bargain with the Crown. John granted\r\nto Richard Fleming, an alien as his name implies, and presumably one of\r\nhis not too reputable mercenaries, the wardship of the lands of the\r\ndeceased Richard Grenvill with the rights of marriage of the widow and\r\nchildren.[435]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 431:\r\n\r\n  See _Pipe Roll_ of 16 John, cited Madox I. 491.\r\n\r\nFootnote 432:\r\n\r\n  See _Pipe Roll_ of 6 John, cited Madox I. 488.\r\n\r\nFootnote 433:\r\n\r\n  See _Pipe Roll_ of 6 John, cited Madox I. 488.\r\n\r\nFootnote 434:\r\n\r\n  _New Rymer_, I. 91.\r\n\r\nFootnote 435:\r\n\r\n  See _New Rymer_, I. 92.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMagna Carta sought to substitute a general rule of law for the\r\nprovisions of these private charters purchased by individuals at ruinous\r\nexpenditure. It contained no startling innovations, but only repeated at\r\ngreater length the promises made (and never kept) by Henry I. in the\r\nrelative part of clause 4 of his coronation charter. No widow was to be\r\nconstrained to marry again against her will. This liberty must not be\r\nused, however, to the prejudice of the Crown’s lawful rights. Although\r\nthe widow need not marry as a second husband the man chosen by the king\r\nwithout her consent, neither could she marry without the king’s consent\r\nthe man of her own choice. Magna Carta specially provided that she must\r\nfind security to this effect, an annoying, but not unfair, stipulation.\r\nThe Crown, in later days, compelled the widow, when having her dower\r\nassigned to her in Chancery, to swear not to marry without licence; and\r\nif she broke her oath, she had to pay a fine, which was finally fixed at\r\none year’s value of her dower.[436]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 436:\r\n\r\n  See Coke, _Second Institute_, 18.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\nNec nos nec ballivi nostri seisiemus terram aliquam nec redditum pro\r\ndebito aliquo, quamdiu catalla debitoris sufficiunt ad debitum\r\nreddendum; nec plegii ipsius debitoris distringantur quamdiu ipse\r\ncapitalis debitor sufficit ad solucionem debiti; et si capitalis debitor\r\ndefecerit in solucione debiti, non habens unde solvat, plegii\r\nrespondeant de debito; et, si voluerint, habeant terras et redditus\r\ndebitoris, donec sit eis satisfactum de debito quod ante pro eo\r\nsolverint, nisi capitalis debitor monstraverit se esse quietum inde\r\nversus eosdem plegios.\r\n\r\n  Neither we nor our bailiffs shall seize any land or rent for any debt,\r\n  so long as the chattels of the debtor are sufficient to repay the\r\n  debt; nor shall the sureties of the debtor be distrained so long as\r\n  the principal debtor is able to satisfy the debt; and if the principal\r\n  debtor shall fail to pay the debt, having nothing wherewith to pay it,\r\n  then the sureties shall answer for the debt; and let them have the\r\n  lands and rents of the debtor, if they desire them, until they are\r\n  indemnified for the debt which they have paid for him, unless the\r\n  principal debtor can show proof that he is discharged thereof as\r\n  against the said sureties.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Charter now passes to another group of grievances. Chapters 9 to 11\r\ntreat of the kindred topics of debts, usury, and the Jews, and should be\r\nread in connection with each other, and with chapter 26, which regulates\r\nthe procedure for attaching the personal estate of deceased Crown\r\ntenants who were also Crown debtors. The present chapter, although quite\r\ngeneral in its terms, had special reference to cases where the Crown was\r\nthe creditor; while the two following chapters treated more particularly\r\nof debts contracted to Jews or other money lenders.\r\n\r\nThe fact that John’s subjects owed debts to his exchequer did not, of\r\ncourse, imply that they had borrowed money from the king. The sums\r\nentered as due in the Rolls of the Exchequer represented obligations\r\nwhich had been incurred in many different ways. What with feudal\r\nincidents and scutages, and indiscriminate fines, so heavy in amount\r\nthat they could only be paid by instalments, a large proportion of\r\nEnglishmen must have been permanently indebted to the Crown. At John’s\r\naccession most of the northern barons still owed the scutages demanded\r\nby Richard. John remitted none of the arrears, while imposing new\r\nburdens of his own: the attempts made to collect these debts intensified\r\nthe friction between John and his barons.[437] It was, further, the\r\nCrown’s practice wherever possible, to make its debtors find sureties\r\nfor their debts, thus widening the circle of those liable to distraint,\r\nwhile the officers who enforced payment were guilty of irregularities,\r\nwhich became the cloaks of grave abuses.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 437:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, p. 89.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThree equitable rules were laid down. (1) The personal estate of a\r\ndebtor must be exhausted before his real estate or its revenues were\r\nattacked. To take away his land might deprive him ultimately of his\r\nmeans of livelihood, since the chattels left to him could not yield a\r\npermanent revenue.[438] The rule here laid down by Magna Carta has not\r\nfound a place in modern systems of law, which usually leave the option\r\nwith the creditor. (2) The estate (both real and personal) of the chief\r\ndebtor had to be exhausted before proceedings could be instituted\r\nagainst his sureties. Magna Carta thus enunciated in English law a rule\r\nwhich has found favour in most systems of jurisprudence. The man who is\r\nonly a surety for another’s debt is entitled to immunity until the\r\ncreditor has taken all reasonable steps against the principal debtor.\r\nSuch a right is known to the civil law as _beneficium ordinis_, and to\r\nmodern Scots law as the “benefit of discussion.” (3) If these sureties\r\nhad, after all, to pay the debt in whole or in part, they were allowed\r\n“a right of relief” against the principal debtor, being put in\r\npossession of his lands and rents. This rule has some analogy with the\r\nequitable principle of modern law, which gives to the surety who has\r\npaid his principal’s debt, the right to whatever property the creditor\r\nheld in security of that debt.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 438:\r\n\r\n  The _Dialogus de Scaccario_, II. xiv., had, half a century earlier,\r\n  laid down rules even more favourable to the debtor in two respects:\r\n  (_a_) the order in which moveables should be sold was prescribed; and\r\n  (_b_) certain chattels were absolutely reserved to the debtor, _e.g._\r\n  food prepared for use; and, in the case of a knight, his horse with\r\n  its equipment.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nEven when the Crown’s bailiffs obeyed Magna Carta by leaving land alone\r\nwhen chattels were available, they might still wantonly inflict terrible\r\nhardship upon debtors. Sometimes they seized goods valuable out of all\r\nproportion to the debt; and an Act of 1266[439] forbade this practice\r\nwhen the disproportion was “outrageous.” Sometimes they attempted to\r\nextort prompt payment or to ruin their victim by selecting whatever\r\nchattel was most indispensable to him. Oxen were taken from the plough\r\nand allowed to die of starvation and neglect. The practice of the\r\nexchequer, in the days of Henry II., had been more considerate; oxen\r\nwere to be spared as far as possible where other personal effects were\r\navailable.[440] John’s charter has no such humane provision,[441] and\r\nthe abuse continued. The Act of 1266, already cited, forbade officers to\r\nchase away the owner who came to feed his impounded cattle at his own\r\nexpense. The _Articuli super cartas_[442] went further; prohibiting the\r\nseizure of beasts of the plough altogether so long as other effects\r\nmight be attached of sufficient value to satisfy the debt.[443]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 439:\r\n\r\n  51 Henry III., stat. 4 (among “statutes of uncertain date” in\r\n  _Statutes of Realm_, I. 197).\r\n\r\nFootnote 440:\r\n\r\n  See _Dialogus de Scaccario_, II. xiv.: “_Mobilia cujusque primo\r\n  vendantur; bobus autem arantibus, per quos agricultura solet exerceri,\r\n  quantum poterint parcant_” (p. 148).\r\n\r\nFootnote 441:\r\n\r\n  Cf., however, the rule as to amercements in c. 20.\r\n\r\nFootnote 442:\r\n\r\n  28 Edward I. c. 12.

See,\r\n  _e.g._ Round, _Ancient Charters_ (Pipe Roll Society, Vol. X.) No. 51,\r\n  and John’s Charter to the Jews, _Rot. Chart._, p. 93.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe taking of usury, denied by law to Christians, was carried on by Jews\r\nunder great disadvantages and risks; and the rates of interest were\r\nproportionately high, ranging in normal cases from two to four pence per\r\npound per week; that is, from 43⅓ to 86⅔ per cent. per annum.[446]\r\nDuring his nonage a ward had nothing wherewith to discharge either\r\nprincipal or interest, since he who had the wardship drew the revenue.\r\nAt the end of a long minority an heir would have found the richest\r\nestates swallowed up by a debt which had increased automatically ten or\r\ntwenty-fold.[447]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 446:\r\n\r\n  See Pollock and Maitland, I. 452, and Round’s _Ancient Charters_,\r\n  notes to Charter No. 51.\r\n\r\nFootnote 447:\r\n\r\n  The Crown was sometimes called in to enable a creditor, overwhelmed by\r\n  the accumulation of interest, to come to a settlement with his\r\n  creditors. In 1199 Geoffrey de Neville gave a palfrey to the king to\r\n  have his aid “in making a moderate fine with those Jews to whom he was\r\n  indebted.” See _Rotuli de Finibus_, p. 40. Ought we to view John’s\r\n  intervention as an attempt to arrange a reasonable composition with\r\n  unreasonable usurers, or was it simply a conspiracy to cheat\r\n  Geoffrey’s creditors?\r\n\r\nMagna Carta prevented this great injustice to the ward; but, in doing\r\nso, inflicted, according to modern standards, some injustice on the\r\nmoney-lenders. During the minority no interest at all, it was provided,\r\nshould accrue to Jew or other usurer; while, if the debt passed to the\r\nCrown, the king must not use his prerogative to extort more than a\r\nprivate debtor might; he must confine himself to the principal sum\r\nspecified in the document of debt. The provision that no interest should\r\nrun during minorities was confirmed by the Statute of Merton,[448] which\r\nmade it clear, however, that its provisions should not operate as a\r\ndischarge of the principal sum or of the interest which had accrued\r\nbefore the ancestor’s death. The Statute of Jewry, of uncertain\r\ndate,[449] made interest irrecoverable by legal process. All previous\r\nacts against usury were repealed by the statute 37 Henry VIII. c. 9,\r\nwhich, however, forbade the exaction of interest at a higher rate than\r\n10 per cent., and this remained the legal rate until reduced to 8 per\r\ncent, by 21 James I. c. 17. Money-lending and the usury laws are\r\nsubjects closely bound up with the repressive measures against the Jews.\r\n\r\nFootnote 448:\r\n\r\n  20 Henry III. c. 5.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 449:\r\n\r\n  _Statutes of Realm_, I. 221.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI. _The History of the Jews in England._ The policy of the Crown towards\r\nthose aliens of the Hebrew race who sought its protection varied at\r\ndifferent times, and three periods may be distinguished. From the Norman\r\nConquest to the coronation of Richard I. the Jews were fleeced and\r\ntolerated; during the reigns of Richard and John and the minority of\r\nHenry III. they were fleeced and protected; and finally they were\r\nfleeced and persecuted, this last stage extending from the formation of\r\nthe alliance between Henry and Innocent IV. down to the ordinance of\r\n1290, which banished in perpetuity all Jews from England. The details of\r\nthis long story of hardship and oppression, tempered fitfully by royal\r\nclemency, which had always to be well paid for, can here be glanced at\r\nonly in the barest outline. There were Jews in England before the Norman\r\nConquest; but the first great influx came in the reign of Rufus, whose\r\nfinancial genius recognized in them an instrument for his gain, and who\r\nwould the more gladly protect them, as likely to prove a thorn in the\r\nside of his enemy the Church. A second influx resulted from the\r\npersecution of Israelites on the Continent of Europe, consequent on the\r\nfailure of the first Crusade. This new alien immigration seems to have\r\nexcited mistrust in England, and led to the disarming of all Jews in\r\n1181, a measure which left them at the mercy of the Christian rabble.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when a disturbance occurred at the coronation of Richard\r\nI., on 3rd September, 1189, owing to the imprudence of some officious\r\nJews, a general massacre took place in London, while York and other\r\ntowns were not slow to follow the example. The king was moved to anger,\r\nnot so much by the sufferings of the Jews, as by the destruction of\r\ntheir bonds, since that indirectly injured the Crown; for the more the\r\nJews had, the more could be extorted from them, and when the written\r\nbond had been burned, no evidence of the debt remained. Richard,\r\nreturning from his captivity a few years later, in urgent need of money,\r\ndetermined to prevent a repetition of such interference with a valuable\r\nsource of revenue. His motive was selfish, but that was no reason why\r\nthe Israelites should not pay for a measure designed for their own\r\nprotection. Assembled at Nottingham they granted a liberal aid, in\r\nreturn for a new expedient devised to secure their bonds. This scheme,\r\nfor the details of which Richard was probably indebted to the genius of\r\nhis great justiciar, archbishop Hubert Walter, was of a comprehensive\r\nand practical character. In London, York, and other important cities,\r\noffices or bureaus were established under the Crown’s protection,\r\ncontaining treasure chests, called _archae_, fitted with triple locks,\r\nto be opened only at stated intervals in the presence of special\r\ncustodians, known as chirographers, who kept the keys. These custodians\r\nwere usually four in number, two Christians and two Jews, chosen by\r\njuries specially summoned for that purpose by the sheriff of the county,\r\nand they were obliged to find sureties that they would faithfully\r\nperform their important functions. Only in their presence could loans be\r\nvalidly contracted between Jews and Christians; and it was their duty to\r\nsee the terms of all such bargains reduced to writing in a regular\r\nprescribed form in duplicate copies. No contract was binding unless a\r\nwritten copy or chirograph had been preserved in one or other of those\r\nrepositories or arks, which thus served every purpose of a modern\r\nregister, and other purposes as well. If the money-lender suffered\r\nviolence and was robbed of his copy of the bond, the debtor was still\r\nheld to his obligations by the duplicate which remained. If the Jew and\r\nall his relatives were slain, even then the debtor did not escape, but\r\nwas confronted by a new and more powerful creditor, the king himself,\r\narmed with the chirograph. Lists of all transactions were preserved, and\r\nall acquittances and assignments of debts, known from their Hebrew name\r\nas “starrs,” had also to be carefully enrolled.[450] Minute and\r\nstringent rules, codified by Hubert Walter in the terms of a written\r\ncommission, were issued to the judges when starting on their circuit in\r\nSeptember, 1194.[451]\r\n\r\nFootnote 450:\r\n\r\n  Cf. J. M. Rigg, _Sel. Pleas of the Jewish Exchequer_, p. xix.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 451:\r\n\r\n  See chapter 24 of the _Forma procedendi in placitis coronae regis_,\r\n  cited in _Sel. Charters_, 262.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIf this cunningly-devised system prevented the Christian debtor from\r\nevading his obligations, it also placed the Jewish creditor completely\r\nat the mercy of the Crown; for the exact wealth of every Jew could be\r\naccurately ascertained from a scrutiny of the contents of the _archae_.\r\nThe king’s officials were enabled to judge to a penny how much it was\r\npossible to wring from the coffers of the Jews, whose bonds, moreover,\r\ncould be conveniently attached until they paid the tallage demanded. The\r\ncustom of fixing on royal castles as the places for keeping these arks,\r\nprobably explains the origin of the special jurisdiction exercised over\r\nthe Jews by the king’s constables (“_qui turres nostras\r\ncustodierunt_”).[452] In the dungeons of their strongholds horrible\r\nengines were at hand for enforcing obedience to their awards. Such\r\njurisdiction, however, extended legitimately over trivial debts\r\nonly.[453] All important pleas were reserved for the officials of the\r\nexchequer of the Jews, a special government department, which controlled\r\nand regulated the whole procedure. Evidences of the existence of this\r\nseparate exchequer have been traced back to 1198, although no record has\r\nbeen found of a date prior to 1218.[454] John, while despising the Jews,\r\nwas not slow to realize that in them the Crown possessed an asset of\r\ngreat value. It was his policy to protect their wealth as a reservoir\r\nfrom which he might draw in time of need, contenting himself meanwhile\r\nwith comparatively moderate sums. Thus, by a charter dated 10th April,\r\n1201, he took 4000 marks in return for confirming their privileges; and\r\nhe obtained a second payment of a similar amount after his rupture with\r\nRome. The charter of 1201 was only a confirmation of rights already\r\nenjoyed by all English Jews in virtue of the liberal interpretation put\r\nupon the terms of an earlier charter which had been granted by Henry I.\r\nto a particular father in Israel with his household, but subsequently\r\nextended, with the tacit concurrence of the Crown, to the whole Hebrew\r\nrace. Under John’s charter they enjoyed valuable and definite\r\nprivileges, which, while leaving them completely in the royal power,\r\nexempted them from all jurisdictions except those of the king and his\r\ncastellans; while, if a Christian brought a complaint against a Jew, it\r\nwas to be judged by the peers of that Jew.[455]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 452:\r\n\r\n  See John’s Charter to the Jews of 10th April, 1201, in _Rotuli\r\n  Chartarum_, p. 93.\r\n\r\nFootnote 453:\r\n\r\n  See Pollock and Maitland, I. 453, n.\r\n\r\nFootnote 454:\r\n\r\n  Rigg, _ibid._, xx.\r\n\r\nFootnote 455:\r\n\r\n  “_Judicata sit per pares Judei._” See _Rot. Chart._, I. 93.\r\n\r\nWhen a repetition of the massacre which had disgraced his brother’s\r\ncoronation threatened to take place in 1203, John promptly ordered the\r\nmayor and barons of London to suppress all such attempts. In terms\r\ncontemptuous alike to the Londoners and to the Jews his writ declared\r\nthat his promise of protection, “even though granted to a dog,” must be\r\nheld inviolate.[456] Protection was accorded to them, however, only that\r\nthey might furnish a richer booty to the Crown, when the proper occasion\r\narrived. Suddenly John issued orders for a wholesale arrest of the Jews\r\nthroughout England. The most wealthy members of their community were\r\nbrought together at Bristol, and, on 1st November, 1210, were compelled\r\nto give a reluctant consent to a general tallage at the enormous sum of\r\n66,000 marks. Apparently this amount had been fixed as the result of an\r\nexaggerated estimate of the contents of the _archae_, and was more than\r\nthey could afford to pay. The methods adopted by John’s castellans to\r\nextort the arrears of the amount are well-known, especially in the case\r\nof the unfortunate Jew of Bristol, from whom seven teeth were extracted,\r\none each day, until he consented to pay the sum demanded.[457]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 456:\r\n\r\n  _Rot. Pat._, I. p. 33, and _New Rymer_, I. 89. The date is 29th July,\r\n  1203.\r\n\r\nFootnote 457:\r\n\r\n  See Rigg, _Sel. Pleas of the Jewish Exchequer_, xxiv.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt was doubly hard that the race thus plundered and tortured by the king\r\nshould be subjected to harsh treatment by the king’s enemies on the\r\nground that they were pampered protégés of the Crown. Yet such was the\r\ncase: on Sunday, 17th May, 1215, when the insurgents on their way to\r\nRunnymede entered London, they robbed and murdered the Jews, using the\r\nstones of their houses to fortify the city walls.[458] It is not to be\r\nwondered then that the same insurgents in forcing on King John the\r\ndemands which formed the basis of Magna Carta, included provisions\r\nagainst usury.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 458:\r\n\r\n  See Miss Morgate, _John Lackland_, p. 230.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe advisers of the young Henry in 1216 omitted these clauses, but not\r\nfrom love of the Jews. They were unwilling to impair so useful a\r\nfinancial resource, which has been compared to a sponge which slowly\r\nabsorbed the wealth of the nation to be quickly squeezed dry again by\r\nthe king. The Jews were always willing to disgorge a portion of their\r\ngains in return for protection in the rest, even of a contemptuous and\r\nintermittent kind; but their lot became hard indeed when Henry III.,\r\nurged by popular clamour and the wishes of the Pope, began a course of\r\nactive persecution, without relaxing the rigour of those royal exactions\r\nwhich had previously been the price of protection. In 1253, a severe\r\nordinance inflicted a long list of vexatious regulations on the Hebrews,\r\nalmost converting their quarters in each great city into ghettos, like\r\nthose of the Continent of Europe. This was merely the commencement of a\r\nseries of oppressive measures, the natural outcome of the growing hatred\r\nwith which Christians regarded Jews,—a result partly of the heated\r\nimagination of the rabble, ready to believe unauthenticated stories of\r\nthe crucifixion of Christian children, and partly of the fact that rich\r\nJews, in spite of all persecution, had possessed themselves of the\r\nlanded estates of freeholders and nobles and claimed to act as lords of\r\nChristian tenants, enjoying wardships, escheats, and advowsons, as any\r\nChristian baron might have done. The scope of this enquiry excludes any\r\ndetailed account of the stages through which repressive legislation\r\npassed, until the lot of the Jews in England became intolerable. The\r\nStatute of Jewry, however,[459] was of exceptional importance; taking\r\nfrom usurers the right to recover interest by legal process, and\r\nlimiting execution for the principal to one half of the debtor’s lands\r\nand chattels. In return some temporary concessions were granted. One by\r\none, all these privileges were withdrawn, until the end came in 1290\r\nwith the issue of a decree of perpetual banishment by Edward I., who was\r\ncompelled to sacrifice the cherished right of keeping a royal preserve\r\nof Jews in deference to the culmination of national prejudice in a storm\r\nof unreasoning hate.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 459:\r\n\r\n  _Statutes of Realm_, I. 221.\r\n\r\nII. _Legal Position of the Jews._ All through these vicissitudes of\r\nfortune the legal status of the Jews had remained unchanged in all\r\nessentials. Their position was doubly hard; they were plundered by the\r\nCrown and persecuted by the populace. If John saved them from being\r\nrobbed by his Christian subjects, it was that they might be better worth\r\nthe robbing by a Christian king. Yet, for this protection, at once\r\nfitful and interested, the Jews had to pay a heavy price; not only were\r\nthey liable to be tallaged arbitrarily at the king’s will, without limit\r\nand without appeal, but they were hated by rich and poor as the king’s\r\nallies. Such feelings would of themselves account for the unsympathetic\r\ntreatment accorded to money-lenders by Magna Carta; two other reasons\r\ncontributed. All usury was looked on in the Middle Ages as immoral\r\n(although illegal only for Christians), while excessive interest was\r\nhabitually exacted.\r\n\r\nThe feudal scheme of society had no place for Jews and afforded them no\r\nprotection. Not only did they share the disabilities common to all\r\naliens, but these were not in their case mitigated by the protection\r\nextended to other foreigners by their own sovereigns and by the Church.\r\nAs exiles in a foreign land, exposed to the attacks of a hostile mob,\r\nthey were forced to rely absolutely on the only power strong enough to\r\nprotect them, the arm of the king. The Jews became the mere serfs, the\r\nperquisites or chattels of the Crown, in much the same way as the\r\nvilleins became the serfs or chattels of their lords. Rights they might\r\nhave against others by royal sufferance, but they had no legal remedy\r\nagainst their master. In the words of Bracton,[460] “the Jew could have\r\nnothing of his own, for whatever he acquired, he acquired not for\r\nhimself but for the king.” His property was his merely by royal\r\ncourtesy, not under protection of the law. When he died, his relations\r\nhad no legal title to succeed to his mortgages, goods, or money; the\r\nexchequer, fortified by an intimate knowledge of the extent of his\r\nwealth (for that consisted chiefly in registered bonds), stepped into\r\npossession and could do what it pleased. The king usually, indeed, in\r\npractice contented himself with one-third of the whole; but if the\r\nrelations of the deceased Jew received less than the balance of\r\ntwo-thirds, they would be well advised to offer no remonstrance. The\r\nCrown did not admit a legal obligation; and there was no one either\r\npowerful enough, or interested enough, to compel the fulfilment of the\r\ntacit understanding which restricted the royal claims. Whatever the Jew\r\nhad amassed belonged legally and potentially not to him but to the\r\nCrown. Magna Carta, in striking at money-lenders, was striking at the\r\nking.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 460:\r\n\r\n  _Folio_, 386b.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nEt si quis moriatur, et debitum debeat Judeis, uxor ejus habeat dotem\r\nsuam, et nichil reddat de debito illo; et si liberi ipsius defuncti qui\r\nfuerint infra etatem remanserint, provideantur eis necessaria secundum\r\ntenementum quod fuerit defuncti, et de residuo solvatur debitum, salvo\r\nservicio dominorum; simili modo fiat de debitis que debentur aliis quam\r\nJudeis.\r\n\r\n  And if anyone die indebted to the Jews, his wife shall have her dower\r\n  and pay nothing of that debt; and if any children of the deceased are\r\n  left under age, necessaries shall be provided for them in keeping with\r\n  the holding of the deceased; and out of the residue the debt shall be\r\n  paid, reserving, however, service due to feudal lords; in like manner\r\n  let it be done touching debts due to others than Jews.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the preceding chapter deprived Jews of part of the interest they\r\nclaimed, the present one deprived them also in certain circumstances of\r\npart of the security on which they had lent the principal. The widow’s\r\ndower lands were discharged from her husband’s debts, only two-thirds of\r\nthe original security thus remaining under the mortgage. Even this must\r\nsubmit to a prior claim, namely the right of the debtor’s minor children\r\nto such “necessaries” as befitted their station in life. Magna Carta, at\r\nthe same time, with characteristic care for feudal rights, provided that\r\nthe full service due to lords of fiefs must not be prejudiced, whoever\r\nsuffered loss. Finally, these rudiments of a law of bankruptcy were made\r\napplicable to Gentile creditors equally as to Jews. These provisions,\r\nwith others injuriously affecting the royal revenue, were omitted in\r\n1216, not to be restored in future charters: but they were re-enacted in\r\ntheir essential principle, though not in detail, by the Statute of\r\nJewry, which limited a creditor’s rights of execution to one moiety of\r\nhis debtor’s lands and chattels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER TWELVE.\r\n\r\nNullum scutagium vel auxilium ponatur in regno nostro, nisi per commune\r\nconsilium regni nostri, nisi ad corpus nostrum redimendum, et\r\nprimogenitum filium nostrum militem faciendum, et ad filiam nostram\r\nprimogenitam semel maritandam, et ad hec non fiat nisi racionabile\r\nauxilium: simili modo fiat de auxiliis de civitate Londonie.\r\n\r\n  No scutage nor aid shall be imposed in our kingdom, unless by common\r\n  counsel of our kingdom, except for ransoming our person, for making\r\n  our eldest son a knight, and for once marrying our eldest daughter;\r\n  and for these there shall not be levied more than a reasonable aid. In\r\n  like manner it shall be done concerning aids from the citizens of\r\n  London.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a famous clause, greatly valued at the time it was framed\r\nbecause of its precise terms and narrow scope (which made evasion\r\ndifficult), and even more highly valued in after days for exactly\r\nopposite reasons. It came indeed to be interpreted in a broad general\r\nsense by enthusiasts who, with the fully-developed British constitution\r\nbefore them, read the clause as enunciating the modern doctrine that the\r\nCrown can impose no financial burden whatsoever on the people without\r\nconsent of Parliament. Before discussing how far such an estimate is\r\njustified, it will be necessary to examine the historical context, with\r\nspecial reference to two classes of John’s subjects; his feudal tenants,\r\nand the citizens of London respectively.\r\n\r\nI. _Protection of Crown Tenants from arbitrary Exactions._ The pecuniary\r\nobligations of the barons may be arranged in two groups according as\r\nthey depended on the king’s own actions, or were determined by\r\ncircumstances which lay beyond the royal control. Payments of the former\r\ntype (such as reliefs and amercements), exigible only at fixed dates or\r\non the occurrence of specific events, were treated of elsewhere in Magna\r\nCarta. The present chapter sought to prevent John from extorting\r\nadditional payments either absolutely at his own discretion, or because\r\nof situations which he had purposely created as excuses for demanding\r\nmoney. The entire field of such arbitrary feudal dues was covered by the\r\nwords “scutages” and “extraordinary aids,”[461] the use of which\r\nprotected the barons from every sort of compulsory payment which might\r\nbe demanded by the king at his own discretion.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 461:\r\n\r\n  “Extraordinary” is here applied to all aids other than the three\r\n  normal ones which, falling due each on a definite occasion, come under\r\n  the opposite group of fixed payments.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(1) _Scutage._ The development of the system described by this name has\r\nbeen traced in the Historical Introduction.[462] Used at first as an\r\nexpedient for substituting, in the Crown’s option, money payments for\r\nmilitary service, it became, under John, a regular source of revenue,\r\nimposed almost every year on one pretext or another, while it was levied\r\nat an increased rate, and under conditions of a vexatious and burdensome\r\nnature. If any one cause contributed, more than the others, to the\r\nrebellion which culminated at Runnymede, it was John’s method of\r\nimposing scutages. This chapter, then, attempted to strike at the common\r\nroot from which many grievances grew. The Crown was no longer to be left\r\nsole judge of the occasions on which a scutage might be demanded. “The\r\ncommon consent (or counsel) of the realm” must first be obtained. If\r\nthis provision had been carried into practice, it would have removed the\r\nsupreme control of the system of scutages from the Crown which received\r\nthe money, to the Crown tenants who paid it. This truly radical remedy\r\nincluded the remedy of all minor abuses as well, since the collective\r\nbody of barons who could refuse payment unconditionally, might _a\r\nfortiori_ make grants under such conditions as they chose. Henceforward\r\nit would lie with them to say, on each occasion, whether the old normal\r\n20s. per knight’s fee should be superseded by some other rate, either\r\nhigher or lower. This provision was never enforced, being omitted\r\naltogether from the reissue of 1216, while the clause substituted for it\r\nin the Charter of 1217 took an entirely different form.[463]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 462:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, 86–93.\r\n\r\nFootnote 463:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, 172–3.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(2) _Feudal aids._ It was recognized from an early date that in\r\nemergencies feudal vassals ought to contribute to their lord’s support\r\nin proportion to the extent of their holdings. Such payments were known\r\nas aids, and were originally supposed to be free-will offerings.[464] By\r\nJohn’s reign they had fallen into two groups—ordinary and extraordinary.\r\nThe former, three in number, were only dealt with incidentally by the\r\nCharter.[465] It is with the “extraordinary” aids that this chapter\r\nspecially occupies itself. These are placed in the same position as\r\nscutages: the Crown cannot exact either, “unless by common counsel of\r\nthe realm.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 464:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, 80–2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 465:\r\n\r\n  These three aids were carefully specified, and a reasonable rate was\r\n  stipulated for, but not defined. In this respect the treatment here\r\n  accorded to _aids_ is less satisfactory than that of _reliefs_ in\r\n  chapter 2, which carefully defined the amount to be paid. It is\r\n  probable that the framers of the present chapter relied on existing\r\n  usage, which seems to have regarded the normal aid as one-fifth of the\r\n  normal relief, _i.e._ as 20s. per knight’s fee. An alternative\r\n  explanation is also possible, that the same “common counsel” which had\r\n  the right to veto extraordinary aids, was also expected to determine\r\n  the reasonable amount of the ordinary aids.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nII. _Protection of Citizens of London from arbitrary Exactions._ Some\r\nattempt was made to protect the men of London, as well as the Crown\r\ntenants, from John’s demands for money. The insurgent leaders in this\r\nway discharged part of their debt to an ally with special claims upon\r\ntheir gratitude.[466] The Articles of the Barons had contained several\r\nimportant provisions affecting the capital; and these were embodied in\r\nthe Charter in slightly altered terms, which suggest some influence at\r\nwork not altogether friendly to the citizens.[467] The present clause of\r\nthe completed charter, for example, uses only one word, “_aids_,” where\r\nthe 32nd of the Articles of the Barons had referred to “tallages and\r\naids.” There is no evidence to show whether the omission had been\r\ndeliberately planned, or was merely the result of inadvertence; and the\r\nambiguity inherent in both words makes it dangerous to hazard a dogmatic\r\nopinion on the practical effect of the alteration. Yet a clearly-marked\r\nline can be traced between the respective meanings of the two terms when\r\nthey are technically used.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 466:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, p. 42.\r\n\r\nFootnote 467:\r\n\r\n  See article 23 (which became c. 33), article 31 (c. 41), and article\r\n  32 (cc. 12 and 13), and cf. _supra_, pp. 140-1. Whether article 12 (c.\r\n  35) was more a benefit to, than a restraint upon, traders seems\r\n  doubtful.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(1) “_Aid_” is the vaguer word, applicable to every payment which can be\r\nregarded as in any sense a free-will offering. It embraced gifts to the\r\nCrown, whether from prelate or burgess or feudal baron. London was\r\nstimulated towards acts of generosity by kings of England both before\r\nand after John. There were times when “voluntary” aids, like the\r\n“benevolences” of Tudor days, could not safely be withheld.\r\n\r\n(2) “_Tallage_” was a tax levied at a feudal lord’s arbitrary will upon\r\nmore or less servile dependants, who had neither power nor right to\r\nrefuse. The frequency of these exactions and the sums taken depended\r\nsolely on the lord’s caprice, restrained by no law, but only by such\r\nlimits as an enlightened self-interest or regard for public opinion\r\nmight dictate. Liability to arbitrary tallage was thus one of the chief\r\nmarks of an unfree status, and was contrasted with the impositions\r\nlevied on those freeholders who held by knight’s service, by socage, or\r\nby frankalmoin. The owner of the smallest manor, like the owner of the\r\ngreatest barony, might tallage his own villeins; and the king had a\r\nsimilar privilege over a wider field. His rights extended even over\r\ncivic communities who held royal charters, since towns were\r\ntheoretically on the royal demesne, and therefore liable to tallage. The\r\ngreat city of London, in spite of its growing wealth, its political\r\nimportance, and its list of chartered privileges, still shared this\r\nliability.[468]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 468:\r\n\r\n  This statement, for which evidence is given _infra_, is not always\r\n  admitted. Taswell-Langmead, _Eng. Const. Hist._, p. 107, says “The\r\n  city of London can never have been regarded as a demesne of the\r\n  Crown.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(3) _Comparison of tallage and aid._ The tallage, as a forced payment,\r\nthus differed fundamentally from the nominally free “aid,” while two\r\nminor points of difference may also be noted. In arranging an aid the\r\ngivers usually suggested the amount, though the king might reject the\r\noffer as insufficient; while the amount of a tallage, on the other hand,\r\nwas arbitrarily fixed by the Crown. Further, while the aid granted by a\r\ncommunity was a joint offering which the citizens assessed and collected\r\nby their own officers, and for which they admitted a collective\r\nresponsibility, the Crown itself allocated on whom it pleased the\r\nparticular sums of tallage to be paid by each individual, no joint\r\nliability being admitted by those who had to pay. It was obviously to\r\nthe advantage of a borough to forestall, by the present of a liberal\r\naid, the Crown’s anticipated demand for a tallage, for the hated\r\ntax-gatherer was thus kept outside the city gates. An aid was also more\r\nto the king’s advantage than a tallage of equal amount. Not only was he\r\nsaved the trouble, expense, and delay of the collection, but he obviated\r\nrisk of loss through the insolvency of some of the individuals fixed\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nA story told by Madox[469] brings out the contrast. A dispute had arisen\r\nbetween the king and the Londoners. To Henry’s demand for 3000 marks of\r\n“tallage” they at first replied by offering 2000 marks of “aid,” which\r\nthe king refused. The citizens then denied liability to tallage\r\naltogether, but were confronted with entries in Exchequer and Chancery\r\nRolls which entirely contradicted their audacious contention. On the\r\nmorrow the mayor and citizens acknowledged that they were talliable, and\r\ngave the king the sum he demanded.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 469:\r\n\r\n  I. 712, citing Mem. Roll 39 Henry III.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(4) _Effects of the omission of the word “tallage” from Magna Carta._ As\r\nthe two words appearing in the Articles of the Barons had\r\nwell-recognized differences of meaning, it is unlikely that the omission\r\nof one of them from the Charter was regarded as a purely verbal change.\r\nJohn would readily enough dispense with the right to exact “aids” from\r\nthe wealthy traders of his capital, if he still preserved his privilege\r\nof tallaging them at pleasure. The omission was perhaps deliberately\r\nmade in deference to John’s strong feeling on a point which did not\r\npersonally affect the barons.[470] Another omission should be noted. The\r\nArticles had extended protection not only to Londoners, but also “to\r\ncitizens of other places who thence have their liberties,” meaning the\r\ntowns whose chartered privileges had been modelled on those of the\r\nmetropolis. Magna Carta completely ignored, in this connection, all\r\ntowns except London.[471]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 470:\r\n\r\n  Alternative explanations are possible, _e.g._ that the prelates,\r\n  accustomed to tallage their own dependants, used their influence\r\n  successfully to combat this innovation as “the thin end of the wedge.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 471:\r\n\r\n  It might possibly be argued that the last clause of chapter 13\r\n  extending to all towns a confirmation of liberties and customs, was\r\n  intended to embrace this provision as to aids. If so, the draftsman\r\n  has expressed himself clumsily.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(5) _The nature of the protection afforded by Magna Carta._ The\r\narrangement of the present chapter is peculiar. After treating fully of\r\nthe abuses of Crown tenants, the case of the Londoners is thrown in\r\ncarelessly in a few words: “In like manner it shall be done concerning\r\naids from the citizens of London.” Various interpretations of the words\r\n“_simili modo_” are possible. High authorities suggest that the clause\r\nmeans no more than that aids taken from London, like ordinary aids taken\r\nfrom Crown tenants, must be “reasonable.”[472] If this is so, a\r\ncriterion of reasonableness different from that applicable to knights’\r\nfees became necessary; and this would have been hard to find.[473]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 472:\r\n\r\n  Such is the opinion expressed in the _Lords’ Report on the Dignity of\r\n  a Peer_, I. 65.\r\n\r\nFootnote 473:\r\n\r\n  In 1168, when Henry II. took an aid for the marriage of his daughter,\r\n  London contributed £617 16s. 8d., which might afford a precedent for a\r\n  “reasonable” aid. See _Pipe Roll_, 14 Henry II., cited Madox, I. 585.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt is equally probable, however, that the intention was to render the\r\nsame consent necessary to the validity of aids, asked from London, as\r\nhad previously been stipulated in the case of scutages from tenants in\r\nchief. If this is so, then the method provided in chapter 14 for taking\r\n“the common counsel of the realm” was peculiarly ill-adapted to secure\r\nto the men of London any effective voice in taxing themselves. The\r\nnecessity for the consent of an exclusively baronial assembly could not\r\nadequately protect the Londoners, whose essentially different interests\r\nwere unrepresented.\r\n\r\nSubsequent history casts no light on the original intention of this\r\nclause; no occasion of testing its meaning ever occurred, the entire\r\nchapter of which it forms part having been omitted from all subsequent\r\nissues of the Charter.\r\n\r\n(6) _Later history of the Crown’s right to tallage the towns._ Magna\r\nCarta, even in its original form, did not deprive the king of his right\r\nto tallage London, like any other part of his ancient demesne; and the\r\nCrown continued quite legally and almost without question to exercise\r\nthis prerogative at intervals from 1215 until 1340. It has sometimes\r\nbeen maintained, indeed, that the _Confirmatio Cartarum_ of 1297 was\r\nintended to abolish this prerogative, and it is true, that a document\r\nonce considered as an authoritative version of the _Confirmatio_ bore\r\nthe suggestive title of _De tallagio non concedendo_. It is now well\r\nknown that the latter document is quite unauthentic; while, if the\r\n_confirmatio_ itself was intended to relieve the towns from tallages\r\ntaken without their consent, it signally failed. Edward III.\r\noccasionally exacted tallages from London and other towns. His\r\nparliaments, however, sought to prohibit this, and succeeded, in 1340,\r\nin passing a statute which abolished, in words peculiarly wide and\r\ncategorical, unparliamentary taxation of every kind whatsoever. This\r\nact, which is sometimes styled by modern writers “the real _statutum de\r\ntallagio non concedendo_,” is held by Dr. Stubbs to have conclusively\r\nabolished _inter alia_ the Crown’s right of tallage.[474] This finally\r\nsettled the law, but did not prevent the king from trying to break that\r\nlaw. In subsequent years Edward III. frequently disregarded the\r\nrestriction thus placed upon his financial resources, and with varying\r\nsuccess. He rarely did so, however, without meeting protests; and the\r\nrule of law laid down in the act of 1340 was never repealed.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 474:\r\n\r\n  See _Const. Hist._, II. 548. “Of the scope of this enactment there can\r\n  be no doubt; it must have been intended to cover every species of tax\r\n  not authorised by parliament, and ... it seems to have had the effect\r\n  of abolishing the royal prerogative of tallaging demesne.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIII. _Magna Carta and the Theory of Parliamentary Taxation._ It is a\r\ncommonplace of our text-books that chapters 12 and 14 taken together\r\namount to the Crown’s absolute surrender of all powers of arbitrary\r\ntaxation, and even that they enunciate a general doctrine of the\r\nnation’s right to tax itself.[475] Yet the very idea of “taxation” in\r\nits abstract form, as opposed to specific tolls and tallages levied on\r\ndefinite things or individuals, is essentially modern. The doctrine of\r\nthe day was that the king in normal times ought “to live of his own,”\r\nlike any other land-owning gentleman. A regular scheme of “taxation” to\r\nmeet the ordinary expenses of government was undreamt of. It is too much\r\nto suppose, then, that our ancestors in 1215 sought to abolish something\r\nwhich, strictly speaking, did not exist. The famous clause treats, not\r\nof “taxation” in the abstract, but of the scutages and aids already\r\ndiscussed. It does not concern itself with the rights of Englishmen as\r\nsuch, but chiefly with the interests of those who held freeholds of the\r\nCrown, and incidentally and inadequately with those of the citizens of\r\nLondon. Several considerations place this beyond reasonable doubt.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 475:\r\n\r\n  _E.g._ Taswell-Langmead, _Engl. Const. Hist._, 106, and Anson, _Law\r\n  and Custom of the Const._, I. 14. Dr. Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, I. 573,\r\n  considers that these words “admit the right of the nation to ordain\r\n  taxation.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(1) The terms of the restriction are by no means wide or sweeping; but\r\nprecise, accurate, and narrow. The “common consent of the realm” was\r\nmade a requisite for three species of exactions at the most: for\r\nscutages and for extraordinary aids taken from the feudal tenants, and\r\npossibly also for aids taken from the city of London: that is all. Not a\r\nword is said of any other form of taxation or of other groups of\r\ntaxpayers. The restriction thus benefits Crown tenants only, with the\r\ndoubtful addition of the Londoners. (2) If under-tenants received by\r\nchapter 15 some protection against their mesne lords, they received none\r\nagainst the claims of the king. The Charter affected not national\r\n“taxation,” but merely feudal dues. (3) The scant measure of protection\r\nafforded did not extend even to all Crown tenants. The king’s villeins\r\nwere, of course, excluded; and so were even freeholders whose tenure was\r\nother than that of chivalry. Socage tenants were left liable to carucage\r\nand other exactions, tenants in frankalmoin (among them the wealthy\r\nCistercian monks) to forced contributions from the wool and hides of\r\ntheir sheep, while the right of the Crown arbitrarily to raise the\r\n“farms” of all parts of its own demesnes was deliberately reserved.[476]\r\n(4) The Crown’s initiative in “taxation” (here restricted in regard to\r\n“aids” and “scutages”) was, under many other names and forms, left\r\nintact. The king required no consent before taking such prizes and\r\ncustom dues as he thought fit from merchandise reaching or leaving\r\nEngland, or before taking tolls and fines at inland markets under the\r\nplea of regulating trade. Tallages also were exigible at discretion from\r\naliens and Jews, from tenants of demesne, from London and other\r\nchartered towns. (5) The limited scope of this restriction on\r\nprerogative is further illustrated by the method provided for taking\r\n“the common consent.” The assembly to be convened for that purpose was a\r\nnarrow body, representative neither of the several ranks and classes of\r\nthe community, nor of the separate national interests, nor yet of the\r\nvarious districts of England. On the contrary, its composition was\r\nextremely homogeneous, an aristocratic council of the military tenants\r\nof the Crown, convened in such a way that only the greater among them\r\nwere likely to attend.[477]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 476:\r\n\r\n  See _infra_, under c. 25.\r\n\r\nFootnote 477:\r\n\r\n  Even when an honour escheated to the Crown, the tenants of that honour\r\n  “were not suitors of the _Curia Regis_.” See _Report on Dignity of a\r\n  Peer_, I. 60.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThese facts serve as a warning not to read into Magna Carta modern\r\nconceptions which its own words will not warrant. This famous clause was\r\nfar from formulating any national doctrine of self-taxation; it was\r\nprimarily intended to protect Crown tenants from impositions levied by\r\nJohn, not _qua_ sovereign but _qua_ feudal lord. Such as it was, it was\r\ntotally omitted, along with its corollary (chapter 14), in 1216. The\r\nprovision substituted for both, in the Charter of 1217, referred only to\r\nscutages, saying nothing about aids, and cannot possibly be read as a\r\ngeneral prohibition of all arbitrary taxation by the Crown.[478]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 478:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, pp. 173-4 and _infra_, under c. 14.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER THIRTEEN.\r\n\r\nEt civitas Londonie habeat omnes antiquas libertates et liberas\r\nconsuetudines suas, tam per terras, quam per aquas. Preterea volumus et\r\nconcedimus quod omnes alie civitates, et burgi, et ville, et portus,\r\nhabeant omnes libertates et liberas consuetudines suas.\r\n\r\n  And the citizens of London shall have all their ancient liberties and\r\n  free customs, as well by land as by water; furthermore, we decree and\r\n  grant that all other cities, boroughs, towns, and ports shall have all\r\n  their liberties and free customs.\r\n\r\n\r\nA full list of the liberties and customs of London would be a long one;\r\nand an account of how each of these grew up and was confirmed by the\r\nCrown need not be given here. The most cherished of the privileges\r\nenjoyed in John’s day were the right to appoint a civic chief, who bore\r\nthe name of mayor, and the right to choose sheriffs of their own who\r\nshould collect the city’s _firma_[479] (or annual rent payable to the\r\nexchequer), so as to obviate the intrusion of royal bailiffs. Only a\r\nbrief account of the way in which the metropolis obtained these two\r\nprivileges need be here attempted.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 479:\r\n\r\n  _Firma_ is explained _infra_, c. 25.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe chief feature of London before the Norman Conquest seems to have\r\nbeen lack of proper municipal organisation. Dr. Stubbs describes the\r\ncapital during the eleventh century as “a bundle of communities,\r\ntownships, parishes, and lordships, of which each has its own\r\nconstitution.”[480] It was thus a collection of small administrative\r\nunits, rather than one large unit. Some semblance of legal unity was, it\r\nis true, afforded by the folkmoot, in which the citizens regularly\r\nassembled; by its smaller council known as “husteng”; and perhaps also\r\nby its “cnihtengild” (if, indeed, this third body be not entirely\r\nmythical); while the existence of a “portreeve” shows that for some\r\nfinancial purposes also the city was treated as one whole. London,\r\nhowever, prior to the reign of Henry I. was far from possessing\r\nmachinery adequate to the duties of a local government for the whole\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 480:\r\n\r\n  Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, I. 439. Cf. Round, _Commune of London_, 220,\r\n  who is in substantial agreement. Miss Mary Bateson, however, thinks\r\n  that “there has been a tendency unduly to minimise the measure of\r\n  administrative unity in the twelfth-century shire of London.” See the\r\n  evidence produced by her, _Engl. Hist. Rev._, XVII. 480-510.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe first step towards acquiring a municipal constitution is generally\r\nsupposed to have been taken by the citizens when they obtained a charter\r\nfrom Henry I. in the last years of his reign (1130-35). This is not\r\nstrictly accurate. London, indeed, by that grant gained certain valuable\r\nprivileges and enjoyed them for a short time, but it did not obtain a\r\nconstitution. The chief rights actually conferred by Henry were as\r\nfollows:—(1) The _firma_ was fixed at the reduced rate of £300 per\r\nannum, the citizens obtaining for this payment a lease in perpetuity of\r\ntheir own city with the surrounding county of Middlesex—the grant being\r\nmade to the citizens and their heirs; (2) they acquired the right to\r\nappoint whom they pleased as sheriffs of London and Middlesex, implying\r\nthe exclusion of the king’s tax-collectors by men of their own choosing;\r\n(3) a similar right of appointing their own nominee as justiciar was\r\nalso conferred on them, to the exclusion apparently of the royal\r\njustices of eyre. Many minor privileges were confirmed which need not\r\nhere be specified. Mr. J. H. Round[481] argues with convincing force\r\nthat these concessions, important as they were, did not confer a civic\r\nconstitution upon London. Henry’s charter, in his opinion, confirmed all\r\nthe already existing separate jurisdictions and franchises, perpetuating\r\nthe old state of disunion, rather than creating a new principle of\r\ncohesion. He proves, further, that these benefits continued in force\r\nonly for a few years after Stephen’s accession. That king was coerced by\r\nthe Earl of Essex into infringing the citizens’ chartered rights; and\r\nLondon did not regain the ground thus lost until the reign of Richard I.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 481:\r\n\r\n  _Geoffrey de Mandeville_, 356.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHenry II., indeed, granted a charter to the citizens in 1155, which is\r\nusually interpreted as a full confirmation of all the concessions of the\r\nearlier Henry.[482] Mr. Round has conclusively proved the error of this\r\nopinion.[483] The charter of 1155 restricted, rather than enlarged, the\r\nprivileges of London, being couched in cautious and somewhat grudging\r\nterms. The main concessions of the earlier charter were completely\r\nomitted: the citizens no longer elected their own sheriffs or their own\r\njusticiar; the reduction of the _firma_ to £300 was not confirmed; and\r\nsubsequent pipe rolls show that Henry doubled that amount, although the\r\nLondoners protested, arguing for the lower rate.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 482:\r\n\r\n  See _e.g._ Miss Norgate, _Angevin Kings_, II. 471.\r\n\r\nFootnote 483:\r\n\r\n  _Geoffrey_, 367.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe next crisis came early in Richard’s reign. Then it was that London\r\nfirst obtained its municipal constitution. Then also it regained and\r\nsecured on a permanent basis the privileges precariously held for a few\r\nyears under Henry I. and Stephen. The form in which the constitution\r\ncame at last was borrowed from France, and was neither more nor less\r\nthan the _Commune_, so well known on the Continent in the twelfth and\r\nthirteenth centuries. The commune of London was possibly modelled upon\r\nthe commune of Rouen; the chief cities of England and Normandy\r\nrespectively must have had intimate relations. Mr. Round[484] has shown\r\nthat these concessions were not, as has sometimes been supposed,\r\nvoluntarily granted in 1189 by Richard I., but were extorted from his\r\nyounger brother John, when that ambitious prince was bidding high for\r\npowerful allies to support his claim to act as Regent. London really got\r\nits first constitution on 8th October, 1191, under picturesque and\r\nmemorable circumstances. While Richard tarried in the Holy Land, a\r\nscramble took place at home for the right to represent him. The\r\nChancellor Longchamp had been appointed Regent; but John, wily and\r\nunscrupulous, successfully ousted him, with the help of the men of\r\nLondon. At the critical moment the metropolis had offered its support on\r\nconditions, which included the restoration of all the short-lived\r\nprivileges conferred by the charter of Henry I., and, in addition, a\r\nmunicipal constitution of its own in the form of a commune of the\r\ncontinental type.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 484:\r\n\r\n  _Commune of London_, 222.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMr. Round, in a notable passage, describes the scene. \"When, in the\r\ncrisis of October, 1191, the administration found itself paralysed by\r\nthe conflict between John, as the king’s brother, and Longchamp, as the\r\nking’s representative, London, finding that she held the scales,\r\npromptly named the 'Commune’ as the price of her support. The chronicles\r\nof the day enable us to picture to ourselves the scene, as the excited\r\ncitizens, who had poured forth overnight, with lanterns and torches to\r\nwelcome John to the capital, streamed together on the morning of the\r\neventful 8th October at the well-known sound of the great bell, swinging\r\nout from its campanile in St. Paul’s Churchyard. There they heard John\r\ntake the oath to the ‘Commune,’ like a French king or lord; and then\r\nLondon, for the first time, had a municipality of her own.\"[485]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 485:\r\n\r\n  _Commune of London_, 224.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFor any accurate definition of a commune we look in vain to contemporary\r\nwriters, who are usually carried away by their political bias. Richard\r\nof Devizes[486] quotes with approval, “_Communia est tumor plebis, timor\r\nregni, tepor sacerdotii_.” Some insight has been gained in recent years,\r\nhowever, into its exact nature. A Commune was a town which had obtained\r\nrecognition as a corporate entity, as a link in the feudal chain,\r\nbecoming the free vassal of the king or other lord, and itself capable\r\nof having sub-vassals of its own.[487] Its chief institutions were a\r\nmayor and an elective council, generally composed of twenty-four\r\nmembers, some or all of whom were known as _échevins_ or _skivini_, a\r\nword which in its modern form of “scavengers” has fallen on evil days,\r\nno longer denoting the city fathers, but men who perform civic duties of\r\na useful but less dignified nature. Perhaps the chief peculiarity of the\r\ncommune was the method of its formation, namely, by popular association\r\nor conspiracy, involving the taking of an oath of a more or less\r\nrevolutionary nature by the citizens and its subsequent ratification by\r\nthose in authority. It is generally admitted that these communes, though\r\nrevolutionary in their origin, were not necessarily democratic in their\r\nsympathies. Under the new constitution of London, the grievous taxation\r\nof Richard’s reign was made to fall more heavily on the poor of London\r\nthan on any other class. The commune thus set up in 1191, tolerated at\r\nfirst rather than encouraged by the Crown, formed thenceforth the\r\nmunicipal government of the capital; the citizens chose not only their\r\nown sheriffs, but also their own mayor, although the latter, when once\r\nappointed, held office for life.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 486:\r\n\r\n  _Select Charters_, p. 252.\r\n\r\nFootnote 487:\r\n\r\n  M. Luchaire, _Communes Françaises_, p. 97, defines it as “_seigneurie\r\n  collective populaire_.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhen John became king, he granted three charters, ratifying the\r\nprivileges of the capital in return for a _gersuma_ (or slump payment)\r\nof 3000 marks.[488] All the franchises specified in the old charter of\r\nHenry I. were now confirmed, with one exception: the liberty to appoint\r\na justiciar of their own, now seen to be inconsistent with the Crown’s\r\ncentralizing policy, was abandoned. None of these charters made mention\r\nof mayor or commune, but they confirmed some minor privileges gained in\r\nRichard’s reign.[489]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 488:\r\n\r\n  Miss Bateson, _Engl. Hist. Rev._, XVII. 508.\r\n\r\nFootnote 489:\r\n\r\n  _E.g._ the removal of obstacles to free navigation in Thames and\r\n  Medway. Cf. _infra_, c. 33.\r\n\r\nA fourth charter, dated 20th March, 1201, was merely of temporary\r\ninterest; but a fifth, granted on 9th May, 1215, little more than a\r\nmonth previous to Magna Carta, is of great importance, and represents\r\nthe bait thrown by John to the citizens in the hope of gaining their\r\nsupport in this new crisis, as he had previously gained it in the crisis\r\nof 1191. The fifth charter not merely confirmed to the citizens in\r\nexplicit terms the right already enjoyed by them of electing a mayor for\r\nlife, but allowed them to elect a new one every year. Miss Norgate does\r\nnot exaggerate, when she describes this concession as “the crowning\r\nprivilege of a fully constituted municipality, the right to elect their\r\nown mayor every year.”[490] An annually elected magistrate would,\r\nundoubtedly, feel his dependence on the citizens more than one holding\r\noffice for life; but it seems probable that the chief value of the grant\r\nlay in its confirmation by John as king, of the rights conceded by him\r\nfourteen years earlier as his brother’s unauthorised representative, and\r\nenjoyed meanwhile on an insecure tenure. The charter of May, 1215, by\r\nofficially recognizing the mayor, placed the commune over which he\r\npresided on a legal footing. The revolutionary civic constitution, sworn\r\nto in 1191 was now confirmed. The citizens acted on the permission\r\ngranted them of annually changing their chief magistrate: but in place\r\nof supporting the king who made the grant, they opened their gates to\r\nhis enemies.[491]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 490:\r\n\r\n  _John Lackland_, 228.\r\n\r\nFootnote 491:\r\n\r\n  From this date the list of mayors shows frequent, sometimes annual,\r\n  changes. Thus Serlo the mercer was Mayor in May, 1215, when London\r\n  opened its gates to the insurgents, while William Hardell had\r\n  succeeded him before 2nd June, 1216, when he headed the citizens who\r\n  welcomed Louis to make London his headquarters.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSuch then was the London whose privileges were confirmed by Magna\r\nCarta—a city which had slowly grown to greatness, obtaining after many\r\nstruggles a complete municipal constitution in the form of a commune\r\nwith annually elected mayor and council, as well as sheriffs of its own\r\nappointment, who excluded the Crown’s financial officers not only from\r\nthe district within its walls but from the whole of Middlesex. The Great\r\nCharter, avoiding details, confined itself to a general confirmation to\r\nthe men of London of their ancient “liberties and free customs,” two\r\nwords[492] whose vagueness ought in this connection to receive a liberal\r\ninterpretation.[493]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 492:\r\n\r\n  Both words are discussed _infra_, c. 39.\r\n\r\nFootnote 493:\r\n\r\n  The Charter mentions neither mayor nor commune, but probably by\r\n  implication confirmed both. Prof. G. B. Adams finds such confirmation,\r\n  not in c. 13, but in c. 12 (by its application of the word _auxilium_\r\n  to London); and maintains that with the omission of this word from\r\n  subsequent charters \"London’s legal right to a commune fell to the\r\n  ground.\" _Engl. Hist. Rev._, XIX. 706.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nLondon, in this respect, was not to stand alone; a similar concession\r\nwas explicitly made in favour of all other cities, boroughs, towns, and\r\nsea-ports. This was a mere confirmation, however, not to be read as\r\nconferring new privileges or exemptions, each borough being left to\r\nprove its own customs as best it might. In the reissues of Henry, the\r\ndistinction of being mentioned by name was shared by these “barons of\r\nLondon,” with “the barons of the Cinque ports,” who from their wealth,\r\ntheir situation, and their fleet, were allies well worth conciliating.\r\nThey played, indeed, a prominent part in the decisive naval victory\r\ngained by Hubert de Burgh on 24th August, 1217.[494]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 494:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, p. 170.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOther portions of John’s Great Charter which specially affected the\r\nLondoners were the last clause of chapter 12, and chapters 33 and 41;\r\nwhile many of the privileges granted or confirmed in other chapters were\r\nshared by them. The Mayor of London, it should be added, was one of the\r\nexecutive committee of twenty-five, entrusted with wide powers to\r\nenforce the provisions of the Charter.[495]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 495:\r\n\r\n  See _infra_, c. 61.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAmong the most cherished privileges claimed by the chartered boroughs\r\nwere the rights to exact tolls and to place oppressive restrictions upon\r\nall rival traders not members of their guilds, foreigners and denizens\r\nalike. The confirmation of these privileges in this chapter has been\r\nheld to contradict chapter 41, which grants protection and immunities to\r\nforeign merchants.[496] The inconsistency, however, should not be pushed\r\ntoo far, since the later chapter aimed at the abolition of “evil\r\ncustoms” inflicted by the king, not of those inflicted by the boroughs.\r\nAt the same time, all favour shown to aliens would be bitterly resented\r\nby their rivals, the English traders. If the charter had been put in\r\nforce in its integrity, the more specific privileges in favour of\r\nforeign merchants would have prevailed in opposition to the vague\r\nconfirmation of borough “liberties” wherever the two came into\r\ncollision.[497]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 496:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Pollock and Maitland, I. 447-8.\r\n\r\nFootnote 497:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _infra_, c. 41.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER FOURTEEN.\r\n\r\nEt ad habendum commune consilium regni, de auxilio assidendo aliter quam\r\nin tribus casibus predictis, vel de scutagio assidendo, summoneri\r\nfaciemus archiepiscopos, episcopos, abbates, comites, et majores\r\nbarones, sigillatim per litteras nostras; et preterea faciemus summoneri\r\nin generali, per vicecomites et ballivos nostros, omnes illos qui de\r\nnobis tenent in capite; ad certum diem, scilicet ad terminum quadraginta\r\ndierum ad minus, et ad certum locum; et in omnibus litteris illius\r\nsummonicionis causam summonicionis exprimemus; et sic facta summonicione\r\nnegocium ad diem assignatum procedat secundum consilium illorum qui\r\npresentes fuerint, quamvis non omnes summoniti venerint.\r\n\r\n  And for obtaining the common counsel of the kingdom anent the\r\n  assessing of an aid (except in the three cases aforesaid) or of a\r\n  scutage, we will cause to be summoned the archbishops, bishops,\r\n  abbots, earls, and greater barons, by our letters under seal; and we\r\n  will moreover cause to be summoned generally, through our sheriffs and\r\n  bailiffs, all others who hold of us in chief, for a fixed date,\r\n  namely, after the expiry of at least forty days, and at a fixed place;\r\n  and in all letters of such summons we will specify the reason of the\r\n  summons. And when the summons has thus been made, the business shall\r\n  proceed on the day appointed, according to the counsel of such as are\r\n  present, although not all who were summoned have come.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis chapter, which has no equivalent among the Articles of the Barons,\r\nappears here incidentally: it would never have found a place in Magna\r\nCarta but for the need of suitable machinery to give effect to the\r\nprovision of chapter 12.[498]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 498:\r\n\r\n  On the whole subject of the _commune concilium_, cf. _supra_ 151-4 and\r\n  also 173-4.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAs the earlier clause is frequently supposed to contain a general\r\ndoctrine of _taxation_, so this one is often cited as enunciating a\r\ngeneral doctrine of _parliamentary representation_; while the close\r\nconnection between the two chapters is taken to indicate an equally\r\nclose connection between the two conceptions supposed to underlie them,\r\nand is urged as evidence that the framers of Magna Carta had grasped the\r\nessentially modern principle that taxation and representation go\r\ntogether.[499] In this view, the barons at Runnymede deserve credit for\r\nanticipating some of the best features of the modern system of\r\nparliamentary government. The words of the text, however, will scarcely\r\nbear so liberal an interpretation. Vital points of difference between\r\nthe principles of Magna Carta and the modern doctrine of representation\r\nare revealed by a careful analysis.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 499:\r\n\r\n  _E.g._ Sir William R. Anson, _Law and Custom of the Constitution_, I.\r\n  14, emphatically declares that one of the two cardinal principles of\r\n  the entire Charter is “that representation is a condition precedent to\r\n  taxation.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nUnder chapter 12 scutages and extraordinary aids could only be levied\r\n“with common counsel of our kingdom,” and now chapter 14, by formulating\r\nrules for convening the individuals whose consent was thus required,\r\nfixes authoritatively the composition of an assembly definitely charged\r\nwith this specific function. The same Latin words which signify joint\r\n“consent” or counsel thus came to signify also a special institution,\r\nnamely, that “Common Council” afterwards of such vital constitutional\r\nimportance, continuing under a new name the old _curia regis_ in several\r\nof its most important aspects, and passing in turn into the modern\r\nParliament. The duties and constitutional importance of this _commune\r\nconcilium_ may be considered under six heads.\r\n\r\nI. _Nature of the Summons._ Formal writs had to be issued when the\r\nattendance of the members was required. These writs must specify the\r\ntime, place, and reason of assembling, giving formal notice at least\r\nforty days in advance. In these respects the writs issued were all to be\r\nthe same; but in one vital particular a distinction was recognized. Each\r\nof the really powerful men of the realm—archbishops, bishops, abbots,\r\nearls, and \"other greater barons\"—must receive a separate writ, under\r\nthe royal seal, addressed to him individually and directly, while the\r\n“smaller barons” were to be summoned collectively and indirectly through\r\nthe sheriffs and bailiffs of each district.\r\n\r\nII. _Composition of the Council._ It is clear that the meetings\r\ncontemplated were purely baronial assemblies since none but Crown\r\ntenants were invited to attend; while individual notice under the king’s\r\nseal was given only to the more important magnates among them. The\r\nCommon Council of the Charter was thus an assembly of military Crown\r\ntenants, and “the common consent of my kingdom” in John’s mouth was\r\nsynonymous with “the consent of my barons.”[500]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 500:\r\n\r\n  This is illustrated by a comparison of the words used in the text with\r\n  the phrases in which Henry and his sons expressed “the common consent”\r\n  to important ordinances and charters: _e.g._ (_a_) the Assize of\r\n  Clarendon in 1166 (_Select Charters_, 143) bears to have been ordained\r\n  by Henry II. “_de consilio omnium baronum suorum_”; (_b_) John’s\r\n  Charter surrendering his kingdom to Innocent in 1213 declares that he\r\n  acted “_communi consilio baronum nostrorum_” (_Select Charters_, 285);\r\n  (_c_) Matthew Paris makes Earl Richard complain to his brother Henry\r\n  III. in 1255 that the Apulian business had been entered on “_sine\r\n  consilio suo et assensu barnagii_” (_Chron. Maj._ V. 520).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe king’s Council had by this time freed itself from any complicated\r\ntheories as to its own composition, which may ever have hampered it. It\r\nwas now extremely homogeneous; a feudal muster of Crown vassals. Some\r\nhistorians, indeed, in their anxiety to find distinguished pedigrees for\r\ntheir democratic ideals, have traced the origins of the leading features\r\nof the modern Parliament back to the Anglo-Saxon era; but such attempts\r\nare hurtful to the best interests of history, while they do not in the\r\nleast advance the cause of popular liberties.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary here to examine the various rival theories professing\r\nto explain the composition of the Anglo-Saxon Witenagemot, or to discuss\r\nthe exact connection between that venerable institution and the _Curia\r\nRegis_ of the Norman kings. As a matter of fact, the early constitution\r\nof the court of the Conqueror or of Rufus seems to have been monarchic\r\nrather than aristocratic or democratic; that is to say, it depended to a\r\ngreat extent on the personal will of the king, who might issue or\r\nwithhold writs of summons very much as he pleased. No evidence exists,\r\nof date anterior to the Great Charter, of any magnate thrusting himself\r\nunbidden into a royal council or forcing the king to issue a formal\r\ninvitation. On one occasion, indeed, the action of Henry II. in omitting\r\nto issue a writ laid him open to unfavourable criticism. This was in\r\nOctober, 1164, when a special council was summoned to Northampton to\r\npass judgment upon various questions at issue between the king and\r\nThomas à Becket. The primate was ordered to appear for judgment, but the\r\nformal writ of summons, which every archbishop, as holder of a barony,\r\nwas wont to receive as matter of course, was deliberately withheld.\r\nApparently contemporary opinion condemned this omission.[501] It is safe\r\nto infer, then, that as early as 1164, the method of issuing these writs\r\nhad become uniform, but this constitutional understanding was not\r\nreduced to writing until embodied in Magna Carta. Thus it was in 1215\r\nthat the magnates of England formulated for the first time a distinct\r\nclaim to be present at the king’s councils; and even then the demand\r\nonly referred to assemblies summoned for one specific purpose.\r\nPreviously, attendance was reckoned not as a privilege, but merely as an\r\nexpensive burden, incident, like so many other burdens, to the\r\npossession of land.[502]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 501:\r\n\r\n  See Ramsay, _Angevin Empire_, p. 54, and authorities there cited.\r\n\r\nFootnote 502:\r\n\r\n  See L. O. Pike, _House of Lords_, 92, \"There is no trace of any desire\r\n  on the part of the barons to be summoned to the king’s great Council\r\n  as a privilege and an honour before the reign of John.\" Cf. also\r\n  _Report on the Dignity of a Peer_, I. 389.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIII. _Position of the “Minor Barons.”_ In recognizing a distinction\r\nbetween two classes of Crown tenants, the Great Charter merely gave the\r\nweight of its authority to existing usage, as that had taken shape in\r\nthe reign of Henry II. Crown tenants varied in power and position in\r\nproportion to the extent of their lands, from the great earl who owned\r\nthe larger share of one or more counties, down to the small free-holder\r\nwith only a few hides, or it might be acres, of land. A rough division\r\nwas drawn somewhere in the midst; but the exact boundary was necessarily\r\nvague, and this vagueness was probably encouraged by the Crown, whose\r\nrequirements might vary from time to time.[503] Those Crown tenants on\r\none side of this fluctuating line were known as _barones majores_, those\r\non the other as _barones minores_. The distinction had been recognized\r\nas early as the days of Henry II.;[504] but Magna Carta helped to\r\nstereotype it, and contributed to the growing tendency to confine the\r\nword “baron” to the greater men.[505] It is unlikely that any “minor\r\nbaron” who obeyed the general summons would enjoy equal authority with\r\nthe magnates invited individually by writ; and it is difficult to say\r\neven whether he was sure of a welcome, and, if so, in what capacity.\r\nThree distinct theories at least have been advanced as to the position\r\noccupied by the “minor barons” in the Common Council. (1) The duty of\r\nattendance, burdensome to all, was specially burdensome to the poorer\r\nCrown tenants. It has accordingly been suggested that the device of\r\ninviting them by general summons was intended as an intimation that they\r\nneed not come. This is the view taken by Prof. Medley.[506]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 503:\r\n\r\n  See Prof. Medley, _Engl. Const. Hist._, 123.\r\n\r\nFootnote 504:\r\n\r\n  See _Dialogus de Scaccario_, II. x. D., “_baronias scilicet majores\r\n  seu minores_.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 505:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, c. 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 506:\r\n\r\n  _Engl. Const. Hist._, 123. “The smaller tenants-in-chief would\r\n  thankfully regard the general summons as an intimation to stay away.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(2) Dr. Hannis Taylor holds an exactly opposite opinion, reading this\r\nchapter as the outcome of a desire to ensure the fuller attendance of\r\nthe smaller men—as an attempt “to rouse the lesser baronage to the\r\nexercise of rights which had practically passed into desuetude.”[507]\r\nEach of the _barones minores_ was thus encouraged to attend for himself\r\nand his own interests. If such an attempt had really been made, and had\r\nsucceeded in compelling the attendance of a large proportion of those\r\nwho previously had almost made good their right to shirk the burden, the\r\nresult would have been to leave no room whatever for the future\r\nintroduction of the representative principle into the national council.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 507:\r\n\r\n  _Engl. Const._, I. 466.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(3) A third theory, while agreeing that those summoned by general writ\r\nwere intended to obey the summons, thinks that the smaller Crown tenants\r\nwere called not exclusively each man for himself, but in a\r\nrepresentative capacity. It is thus suggested that a few knights\r\n(probably elected for this purpose by their fellows) were expected to\r\nattend to represent the others. Dr. Stubbs seems predisposed towards\r\nthis opinion, although he expresses himself with his usual caution.[508]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 508:\r\n\r\n  See _Const. Hist._, I. 666. “Whether or no the fourteenth article of\r\n  the Great Charter intended to provide for a representation of the\r\n  minor tenants-in-chief by a body of knights elected in the county\r\n  court,” etc.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe reasons for rejecting this third theory will be more conveniently\r\ndiscussed in connection with the doctrine of representation. It is\r\nperhaps unnecessary to decide between the two others; but it may be\r\nsuggested, even at the risk of seeming to invent a fourth theory in a\r\nseries already too numerous, that to the great men who framed the clause\r\nit must have been a matter of supreme indifference whether their humbler\r\nfellow-tenants attended or stayed away. The general summons expressed\r\nneither an urgent desire for their presence, nor yet an intimation that\r\nthey were not wanted; but merely conformed with the established usage,\r\nand left with each “minor baron” the decision whether he should come or\r\nstay away. His presence would make little difference upon the\r\ndeliberations of the magnates.\r\n\r\nIV. _Representation._ It is well to hesitate before applying to ancient\r\ninstitutions a word so essentially modern as “representation.” In a\r\nsense the reeve and the four best men of every village “represented”\r\ntheir fellows in the county court from a very early age; and in a\r\nsomewhat different sense the feudal lord “represented” his free tenants\r\nand villeins in the king’s court, but in neither instance was there\r\nanything approaching the very definite relation which exists at the\r\npresent day between the elected member of Parliament and the\r\nconstituents he “represents.” It is true that the difference may in some\r\nrespects be one of degree rather than of kind, and it is further true\r\nthat two years before the date of Magna Carta a tentative experiment had\r\nbeen tried in the direction of introducing representatives of the\r\ncounties into the king’s Council, thus taking the first step in a long\r\nprocess destined ultimately to lead without any absolute breach of\r\ncontinuity to the modern Parliament. But the Barons in June, 1215,\r\nshowed no desire to follow the example set by John in November, 1213.\r\nThe terms in which Magna Carta directs that all minor barons should be\r\nsummoned are explicit, and may be profitably contrasted with the words\r\nused in the writ dated 7th November, 1213, addressed to the sheriff of\r\nOxford, ordering him to compel, in addition to the barons and the\r\nknights already summoned (presumably _barones minores_), the attendance\r\nof _quatuor discretos homines de comitatu tuo_ (presumably other than\r\nCrown tenants).[509]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 509:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, p. 36. The writ appears in _Rot. Claus_, I. 165, and also\r\n  in _Sel. Charters_, 287. Cf. _New Rymer_, I. 117.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSo far from the words of Magna Carta showing any desire to confirm this\r\nprecedent, they show a deliberate intention to ignore it, and to fall\r\nback on the more ancient practice. The members of the assembly which\r\nMagna Carta stipulated should be convened for the taking of “the common\r\nconsent” were all of one type, drawn from the same section of the\r\nland-owning aristocracy, namely, military tenants-in-chief of the Crown.\r\nThe barons, great and small, might be present, each man for himself; but\r\nthe other tax-paying classes were completely ignored.[510] They were\r\nneither present nor yet represented. The barons in this, as in other\r\nmatters, stood out for the old feudal order under which they had\r\npreserved a wide measure of independence from the Crown’s control;\r\nwhereas King John for selfish reasons adopted the more enlightened\r\npolicy of his father, and even, unconsciously it may be, anticipated\r\nsome of the measures of his grandson, Edward Plantagenet. In brief, John\r\nwas progressive, while his opponents were conservative. The present\r\nchapter must be added to the not inconsiderable list of those which\r\nattempted to bring about a feudal reaction.[511]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 510:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, c. 12.\r\n\r\nFootnote 511:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Anson, _Law and Custom_, I. 44. “The provisions of 1215 described\r\n  an assembly of a type which was already passing away.” Cf. what is\r\n  said of reactionary tendencies in connection with cc. 37 and 39.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nV. _Powers and Functions of the Council._ It was not until long after\r\nthe days of Magna Carta that Parliament secured the most important of\r\nthose functions now deemed essential to its existence. No claim was made\r\nby the Great Charter on behalf of the _commune concilium_ to any right\r\nto be consulted in the making of laws or in the performance of\r\nadministrative or judicial duties by the Crown. No effort was made\r\ntowards formulating any doctrine of ministerial responsibility. This\r\nassembly, narrow and aristocratic in its composition, had only one right\r\nsecured to it by Magna Carta—namely, a limited control over one form of\r\ntaxation. Even here, as we have seen, no general or sweeping claim was\r\nput forward on its behalf. It had no right to a control of the national\r\npurse: the barons confined themselves to a selfish assertion of a right\r\nto protect their own individual pockets against an increase of feudal\r\nburdens. A modern Magna Carta would have contained a careful list of the\r\npowers and privileges of “the common council of the realm,” and would\r\nhave given to this list a conspicuous place of honour.[512]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 512:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _Report on Dignity of a Peer_, I. 63, where it is mentioned as\r\n  “remarkable that no one article in the Charter has reference to the\r\n  previous existence of any assembly convened for general purposes of\r\n  legislation; nor does the charter contain any provision for the\r\n  calling of any such assembly in the future, or any provision\r\n  purporting the existence by law of any representative system for the\r\n  purpose of general legislation.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nVI. _Rights of Majorities and Minorities._ The medieval conception of\r\nconstitutional solidarity was defective; the king’s council acted too\r\nmuch like a fortuitous gathering of unrelated individuals, and too\r\nlittle like a recognized organ of the body politic. Each “baron” was\r\nsummoned on his own behalf, and in order that he might give his\r\nindividual consent to a proposed levy; while it is doubtful how far a\r\ndissenting minority could be bound by a decision of the rest.\r\nAccordingly, the framers of Magna Carta deemed it necessary to assert\r\nwhat would be too obvious to modern politicians to require\r\nassertion—namely, that when the _commune concilium_ had been properly\r\nconvened, its power to transact business should not be interfered with\r\nbecause a section of those summoned chose to stay away. “The business\r\nshall proceed on the day appointed, according to the advice of such as\r\nshall be present, although all that were summoned do not come.” Not all\r\nbusiness was competent, however, for the cause of summons had to be\r\nmentioned in the writs. If these writs were in order, the Council, so we\r\nmay presume, had power to impose aids or scutages on those who were\r\nabsent.[513]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 513:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, I. 607: “Absence, like silence, on such\r\n  occasions implies consent.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNothing is said, however, as to the validity of a protest made by those\r\nwho came and expressed disapproval of what the majority agreed to. As\r\nthe substance of this chapter was observed in practice (though omitted\r\nfrom subsequent confirmations), a precedent of the year 1221 may perhaps\r\nbe cited to illustrate the interpretation put upon it by contemporary\r\npractice. A Council summoned by William Marshal, as Regent of Henry\r\nIII., had consented to a levy of scutage, and the bishop of Winchester\r\nwas assessed at 159 marks as the amount due for his knight’s fees. He\r\nrefused to pay, on the ground, quite untenable by modern standards, that\r\nhe had all along dissented from the grant. The fact of his protest was\r\nvouched by Hubert de Burgh and others who had been present at the\r\nCouncil. The plea was actually accepted by the Regent, and the exchequer\r\nadjudged bishop Peter to be quit of the payment.[514] The incident shows\r\nhow far the statesmen of the day were from realizing the most elementary\r\nprinciples of political theory. They had not yet grasped the conception\r\nof a Council endowed with constitutional authority to impose its will on\r\na dissenting minority. Here it was apparently a minority of one.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 514:\r\n\r\n  See _Pipe Roll_ of 5 Henry III., cited Madox, I. 675.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe barons by consenting in 1217 to accept a return to the fixed rates\r\nof scutage customary in the reign of Henry II., deliberately sacrificed\r\nsuch right of control over the finances of the nation as they may have\r\nobtained in 1215. At no time, indeed, did they show any appreciation of\r\nthe vital nature of the constitutional issues at stake. The importance\r\nof the common council, and the necessity of defining its composition,\r\nfunctions, and privileges, lay entirely beyond their narrow sphere of\r\nvision.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered, however, that the substance of this chapter of\r\nJohn’s charter (although discarded in subsequent reissues) was virtually\r\nobserved in practice by the Crown, and treated as in force by the\r\nbarons. From this time forward the Common Council was almost invariably\r\nconsulted before the Crown attempted to levy such contributions; and\r\nsometimes was bold enough to make conditions or to decline payment\r\naltogether, the first instance on record of an outright refusal taking\r\nplace in a Parliament held at London in January, 1242.[515]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 515:\r\n\r\n  See Prothero, _Simon de Montfort_, 67, and authorities there\r\n  mentioned.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe barons, in October, 1255, if Matthew Paris has not fallen into\r\nerror, considered that the provisions of chapters 12 and 14 of John’s\r\nMagna Carta were still in force, although they had been omitted in the\r\nreissues of Henry III. When the king asked a liberal aid in furtherance\r\nof his scheme for securing the crown of Sicily for his son Edmund, those\r\npresent at the Council deliberately refused, on the ground that some of\r\ntheir peers had not been summoned “according to the tenor of Magna\r\nCarta.” This incident illustrates the extreme constitutional importance\r\nrightly attached by the barons to the rigid observance by the Crown of\r\nthe established usage relative to the convening of Parliament.[516]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 516:\r\n\r\n  See M. Paris, _Chron. Maj._, V. 520. His words are: “_Et responsum\r\n  fuit quod omnes tunc temporis non fuerunt juxta tenorem magnae cartae\r\n  suae vocati, et ideo sine paribus suis tunc absentibus nullum\r\n  voluerunt tunc responsum dare_.” Matthew, however, probably improved\r\n  his story in the telling, adding local colour from the only version of\r\n  the charter known to him—namely, that spurious copy he had\r\n  incorporated in his own history. He clearly knew nothing of the\r\n  essential differences between the charters of John and of Henry. The\r\n  barons in 1255 may, or may not, have been equally ignorant.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER FIFTEEN.\r\n\r\nNos non concedemus de cetero alicui quod capiat auxilium de liberis\r\nhominibus suis, nisi ad corpus suum redimendum, et ad faciendum\r\nprimogenitum filium suum militem, et ad primogenitam filiam suam semel\r\nmaritandam, et ad hec non fiat nisi racionabile auxilium.\r\n\r\n  We will not for the future grant to any one licence to take an aid\r\n  from his own free tenants, except to ransom his body, to make his\r\n  eldest son a knight, and once to marry his eldest daughter; and on\r\n  each of these occasions there shall be levied only a reasonable aid.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis chapter confers on the tenants of mesne lords protection similar to\r\nthat already conferred on Crown tenants: sums of money are no longer to\r\nbe extorted from them arbitrarily by their lords.[517] Different\r\nmachinery, however, had here to be adopted, since the expedient relied\r\non in chapter 12 (“the common consent of the realm”) was clearly\r\ninapplicable.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 517:\r\n\r\n  The chapter is, therefore, on the one hand a necessary supplement of\r\n  cc. 12 and 14, while on the other it is merely a particular\r\n  application of the general principle enunciated in c. 60, which\r\n  extended to sub-tenants all the benefits secured to Crown tenants by\r\n  previous chapters.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI. _Points of difference between tenants-in-chief and under-tenants._\r\nTenants of mesne lords were in some respects better off than tenants of\r\nthe king,[518] but in others their position was distinctly worse. Not\r\nonly had they to satisfy the demands of their own lord for “aids,” but\r\nthey generally found that part of every burden laid by the king upon\r\nthat lord’s shoulders was transferred to theirs. In seeking to provide\r\nfor under-tenants the protection of which they stood so much in need\r\nMagna Carta looked, not to the common council, but to the king. No mesne\r\nlord was to be allowed to compel his tenants to contribute to his\r\nnecessities without obtaining a written licence from the Crown; and\r\nstringent rules forbade the issue of such licences except upon the usual\r\nthree occasions. Contrast this procedure with that which affected Crown\r\ntenants.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 518:\r\n\r\n  The exemptions enjoyed by them are explained under c. 43.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(1) While chapter 12 had spoken of “aids and scutages,” this one speaks\r\nof “aids” alone. The omission can be readily explained: a mesne lord in\r\nEngland had no right of private war, and was, as a logical consequence,\r\ndebarred from demanding scutage upon his own initiative. He might,\r\nindeed, allocate upon his freeholders part of any scutage which the\r\nCrown had taken from him; but the great barons who framed the Charter\r\nhad no intention to renounce so just a right. The restriction of this\r\nclause to “aids” was thus intentional.\r\n\r\n(2) It would have been absurd to require “the common counsel of the\r\nrealm” to every aid paid by the freeholders of a manor. The embryo\r\nParliament had no time for petty local affairs; and the present chapter\r\nmakes no such suggestion. Some substitute had, however, to be found. A\r\nnatural expedient would have been to compel the mesne lord who wished an\r\naid to take “the common consent” of the freeholders of his manor,\r\nassembled for that purpose in their court baron, as in a local\r\nparliament. This course was sometimes followed. Henry Tracey, for\r\nexample, in 1235 (although armed with a royal writ), convened his\r\nDevonshire knights and obtained their collective consent to an aid of\r\n20s. per fee on the occasion of his daughter’s marriage.[519] No such\r\nobligation, however, had been placed upon mesne lords by Magna Carta,\r\nwhich had sought a practical substitute for “the common consent of the\r\nrealm” in quite a different direction, as will be explained immediately.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 519:\r\n\r\n  See Bracton’s _Notebook_, case 1146, cited by Pollock and Maitland, I.\r\n  331.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(3) A check upon such exactions was sought, not in any action by the\r\ncourt baron, but in the mesne lord’s need for a royal licence. The\r\nnecessity for this may at first have been a practical, rather than a\r\nlegal, one; for executive power lay with the officers of the Crown\r\nalone, and the sheriff gave his services only at the king’s\r\ncommand.[520] The Crown thus exercised what was virtually a power of\r\nveto over all aids taken by mesne lords. Such a right, conscientiously\r\nused, would have placed an effectual restraint on their rapacity. John,\r\nhowever, employed it solely for his own advantage, selling writs to\r\nevery needy lord who proposed to enrich himself (and, incidentally, the\r\nCrown also) at his tenants’ expense.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 520:\r\n\r\n  In theory, in Henry II.’s reign at least, a royal writ was _not_\r\n  required in the normal case. See _Dialogus_, II. viii., and the\r\n  editors’ comment (p. 191): “Normally the levying of money under any\r\n  pretext from a land-owner gave him a right to make a similar levy on\r\n  his under-tenants.” As regards _scutage_, a distinction was\r\n  recognized. The lord who actually paid scutage might collect it from\r\n  his sub-tenants without a licence; but, if he served in person, he\r\n  could recover none of his expenses except by royal writ. See _Ibid._,\r\n  and cf. Madox, I. 675. It is necessary, however, to avoid confusion\r\n  between two types of writ, (_a_) that which merely authorized\r\n  contributions, _e.g._, _de scutagio habendo_; (_b_) that which\r\n  commanded the sheriff to give his active help.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMagna Carta forbade the two tyrants thus to combine against the\r\nsub-tenants, enunciating a hard-and-fast rule which, if duly observed,\r\nwould have struck at the root of the grievance. The whole subject of\r\naids was removed from the region of royal caprice into the region of\r\nsettled law. No writ could be lawfully issued except on the three\r\nwell-known occasions.\r\n\r\nII. _The Influence of Magna Carta upon later Practice._ This chapter,\r\nalong with chapters 12 and 14, was discarded by Henry III.; and little\r\ndifference, if any, can be traced between the practices that prevailed\r\nbefore and after 1215. Only in one particular were the requirements of\r\nJohn’s Magna Carta observed, namely, as regards the need for obtaining a\r\nroyal licence. Mesne lords after this date, whatever may have been their\r\nreason, invariably asked the Crown’s help to collect their aids. They\r\ncould not legally distrain their freeholders, except through the\r\nsheriff, and this was, in part at least, a result of Magna Carta.[521]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 521:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Pollock and Maitland, I. 331: “The clause expunged from the\r\n  Charter seems practically to have fixed the law.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHenry III., however, entirely disregarded the rule which forbade the\r\nlicensing of extraordinary aids. Like his ancestors, he was prepared to\r\ngrant writs on almost any plausible pretext. From the _Patent_ and\r\n_Close Rolls_, as well as from other sources, illustrations of the\r\nCrown’s earlier and later practice may readily be collected.\r\n\r\n(1) _Scutages._ In 1217, for example, Henry granted permission to all\r\nCrown tenants who had served in person to collect scutage from their\r\nknights.[522]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 522:\r\n\r\n  _Close Rolls_, I. 306, cited Pollock and Maitland, I. 331.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(2) _Ordinary Aids._ (_a_) John in 1204 authorized the collection of “an\r\neffectual aid” from the knights and freeholders of the Constable of\r\nChester for the ransom of their lord.[523] (_b_) A royal writ in 1235\r\nallowed Henry Tracey, as already mentioned, to take an aid for his\r\neldest daughter’s marriage.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 523:\r\n\r\n  _Patent Rolls_, 5 John, cited Madox. I. 615.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(3) _Special Aids._ (_a_) When a _fine_ of sixty marks was incurred in\r\n1206 by the Abbot of Peterborough, John allowed him to distrain his\r\nunder-tenants for contributions.[524] (_b_) An heir, paying _relief_,\r\nmight likewise transfer the obligation to his freeholders.[525] (_c_)\r\nThe lord’s _debts_ were frequently paid by his tenants. The returns to\r\nthe Inquest of 1170 contain particulars of the “sums given individually\r\nby some forty burgesses of Castle Rising towards paying off the\r\nmortgages of their lord, the Earl of Arundel, who was clearly in the\r\nhands of the Jews”;[526] while in 1234 the Earl of Oxford and the Prior\r\nof Lewes each obtained a letter patent distraining their tenants to\r\ncontribute to the discharge of their debts.[527] Sufficient evidence is\r\nthus preserved that Henry III. took full advantage of the omission from\r\nhis own charters of this part of his father’s promises. He did not\r\nquestion too minutely the justice of applications for such writs, if\r\ngood fees were punctually paid. His letters, during the earlier years of\r\nhis reign, authorized the taking of a “reasonable” aid, without hinting\r\nat any mode of determining what that was. This is illustrated by the\r\nprocedure adopted by Henry Tracey in 1235, who apparently debated with\r\nhis assembled knights of Devonshire the amount to be paid as\r\n“reasonable,” and finally accepted 20s. per fee.[528] It is interesting\r\nto note, however, that this same mesne lord, twelve years later,\r\nobtained a writ bidding the sheriff of Somerset assist him to collect\r\n“the scutage of Gascony” at a specified rate, namely, 40s. per fee.[529]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 524:\r\n\r\n  _Close Rolls_, 7 John, cited Madox, I. 616.\r\n\r\nFootnote 525:\r\n\r\n  See Glanvill, IX. 8.\r\n\r\nFootnote 526:\r\n\r\n  See Round, _Commune of London_, 130.\r\n\r\nFootnote 527:\r\n\r\n  See Madox, I. 617, citing _Patent Rolls_, 18 Henry III. Various other\r\n  examples are given by Pollock and Maitland, I. 331, _e.g._ “the earl\r\n  of Salisbury, to enable him to stock his land.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 528:\r\n\r\n  _Supra_, p. 303, and cf. Pollock and Maitland, I. 331.\r\n\r\nFootnote 529:\r\n\r\n  See Madox, I. 677.\r\n\r\nThe first Statute of Westminster virtually reverted to the rule laid\r\ndown in 1215, for its terms imply that aids could only be taken on the\r\nthree well-known occasions. The vague declaration that these should be\r\nreasonable in amount is replaced by the specification of a fixed rate,\r\nnamely 40s., or double what had been usual at an earlier period.\r\nDefinition of the amount and times of payment may, however, have been\r\nworth purchasing even at this increase.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER SIXTEEN.\r\n\r\nNullus distringatur ad faciendum majus servicium de feodo militis, nec\r\nde alio libero tenemento, quam inde debetur.\r\n\r\n  No one shall be compelled to perform greater service for a knight’s\r\n  fee, or for any other free tenement, than is due therefrom.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor military tenants, the transition from scutage to service was a\r\nnatural one; since it was not enough to protect themselves from\r\nexactions in money, if they were still exposed to arbitrary exactions in\r\nkind. John, therefore, declared that no freeholder should be constrained\r\nto do more service for his lands than he was legally bound to do.\r\nDisputes might arise, however, as to what extent of service actually was\r\ndue in each particular case, and Magna Carta did nothing to remove such\r\nambiguities. The difficulties of definition, indeed, were enormous,\r\nsince the duration and conditions of service might vary widely even\r\namong tenants-in-chivalry, in consequence of special exemptions or\r\nspecial burdens which appeared in title deeds or rested upon immemorial\r\nusage. The barons would be unwilling to enter on so intricate and\r\nlaborious a task, fearing that the introduction of such complications\r\nmight do more harm than good. The necessity for accurate definition may\r\nnever have occurred to them: the main purport of their grievance was so\r\nvividly present to their own minds that they did not acknowledge the\r\npossibility of any mistake. The military Crown tenants had frequently\r\nobjected to serve abroad, particularly during John’s campaigns in\r\nPoitou, which involved a long expensive journey to a region in which\r\nthey had nothing at stake.[530] They regarded themselves as not legally\r\nbound to make expeditions to such portions of the Angevin Empire as had\r\nnot belonged to the Norman kings when their ancestors got their fiefs.\r\nTo force them to enter on campaigns to the south of France, or to fine\r\nthem heavily for staying at home, was, they argued, to distrain them _ad\r\nfaciendum majus servicium de feodo militis quam inde debetur_. When they\r\ninserted these words in the Charter, they doubtless regarded them as an\r\nabsolute prohibition of compulsory service in Poitou, at all\r\nevents.[531] The clause was wide enough, however, to include many minor\r\ngrievances connected with service. The barons did not confine its\r\nprovisions to military service even, but extended it to other forms of\r\nfreehold tenure (“_nec de alio libero tenemento_”). No freeholder,\r\nwhether in socage, serjeanty, or frankalmoin, could in future be\r\ncompelled to render services not legally due.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 530:\r\n\r\n  See the authorities cited _supra_, p. 85, nn. I and 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 531:\r\n\r\n  In the so-called “unknown Charter of Liberties” (see Appendix) John\r\n  concedes to his men “_ne eant in exercitu extra Angliam nisi in\r\n  Normanniam et in Brittaniam_,” a not unfair compromise, which may\r\n  possibly represent the sense in which the present chapter was\r\n  interpreted by the barons.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIf the barons thought they had thus settled the vexed questions\r\nconnected with foreign service, they deceived themselves. Although this\r\nchapter (unlike those dealing with scutage) remained in full force in\r\nall subsequent confirmations, it was far from preventing disputes. Yet\r\nthe disputants in future reigns occupied somewhat different ground. From\r\nthe days of William I. to those of Charles II., when the feudal system\r\nwas abolished, quarrels frequently arose, the most famous of which\r\nculminated in 1297 in Edward’s unseemly wrangle with the Earls of\r\nNorfolk and Hereford, whose duty it was to lead the royal army as\r\nhereditary Constable and Marshal respectively, but who refused\r\npoint-blank to embark for Gascony except in attendance on the king’s\r\nperson.[532]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 532:\r\n\r\n  Walter of Hemingburgh, II. 121. Cf., on the whole subject of foreign\r\n  services, _supra_, 154.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt has been shown in the Historical Introduction[533] how the\r\nobligations of a military tenant fell naturally into three groups\r\n(services, incidents, and aids), while a fourth group (scutages) was\r\nadded when the Crown had adopted the expedient of commuting military\r\nservice for its equivalent value in money.\r\n\r\nFeudal grievances also may be arranged in four corresponding groups,\r\neach redressed by special clauses of Magna Carta: abuse of _aids_ by\r\nchapters 12, 14, and 15; abuse of the feudal _incidents_, by chapters 2\r\nto 8; abuse of _scutage_, by chapters 12 and 14; and abuse of _service_,\r\nby the present chapter, which thus completes the long list of provisions\r\nintended to protect tenants against their feudal lords.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 533:\r\n\r\n  _Supra_, 72–86.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\r\n\r\nCommunia placita non sequantur curiam nostram sed teneantur in aliquo\r\nloco certo.\r\n\r\n  Common pleas shall not follow our court, but shall be held in some\r\n  fixed place.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn attempt was here made to render royal justice cheaper and more\r\naccessible. Law-suits in which the Crown had no special interest, common\r\npleas, were to be held in some one, fixed, pre-appointed spot, and must\r\nno longer follow the king as he moved about from place to place. The\r\nfull extent of the boon conferred by this reform will be better\r\nappreciated after a short consideration of the method of dispensing\r\njustice adopted by Henry II. and his sons.\r\n\r\nI. _The Curia Regis as a Court of Law._ The evil complained of was a\r\ncharacteristically medieval one, and arose from the fact that all\r\ndepartments of government were originally centred in the king and his\r\nhousehold, or _Curia Regis_, which performed royal and national business\r\nof every kind. This _Curia Regis_, indeed, united in itself the\r\nfunctions of the modern Cabinet, of the administrative departments (such\r\nas the Home Office, the Foreign Office, and the Admiralty), and of the\r\nvarious legal tribunals. It was the parent _inter alia_ of the Court at\r\nSt. James’s and the courts at Westminster. One result of throwing so\r\nmany and miscellaneous duties on a small body of hard-worked officials\r\nwas to produce a congestion of business. Nothing could be done outside\r\nof the royal household, and that household never tarried long in any one\r\nspot. Everything was focussed to one point, but to a point constantly in\r\nmotion. Wherever the king went, there the _Curia Regis_, with all its\r\ndepartments, went also. The entire machinery of royal justice followed\r\nHenry II., as he passed, sometimes on the impulse of the moment, from\r\none of his favourite hunting seats to another. Crowds thronged after him\r\nin hot pursuit, since it was difficult to transact business of moment\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThis entailed intolerable delay, annoyance, and expense upon litigants\r\nwho brought their pleas for the king’s decision. The case of Richard\r\nd’Anesty is often cited in illustration of the hardships which this\r\nsystem inflicted upon suitors. His own account is extant and gives a\r\ngraphic record of his journeyings in search of justice, throughout a\r\nperiod of five years, during which he visited in the king’s wake most\r\nparts of England, Normandy, Aquitaine, and Anjou. The plaintiff,\r\nalthough ultimately successful, paid dearly for his legal triumph.\r\nReduced to borrow from the Jews to meet his enormous outlays, mostly\r\ntravelling expenses, he had to discharge his debts with accumulations of\r\ninterest at the ruinous rate of 86⅔ per cent.[534]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 534:\r\n\r\n  Cf. J. F. Stephen, _Hist. of Crim. Law_, I. 88-9.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nII. _Common Pleas and Royal Pleas._ Long before 1215 all litigations\r\nconducted before the king’s courts had come to be divided roughly into\r\ntwo classes, according as the royal interests were or were not specially\r\naffected by the issue. Those on one side of this fluctuating line were\r\nknown as royal pleas, or “pleas of the Crown,” provisions for holding\r\nwhich are contained in chapter 24, those on the other side as ordinary\r\npleas or “common pleas,” to which alone the present chapter refers. As\r\nthese ordinary suits did not require to be determined in the royal\r\npresence, it was therefore possible to appoint a special bench of judges\r\nto sit permanently in some fixed spot, to be selected once for all as\r\nlikely to suit the convenience of litigants. No town was named in Magna\r\nCarta; but Westminster, even then the natural home of law, was probably\r\nintended from the first. It is Westminster that Sir Frederick Pollock\r\nhas in mind when he writes in reference to this chapter: “We may also\r\nsay that Magna Carta gave England a capital.”[535] The barons in 1215,\r\nhowever, in asking this reform, were not insisting on any startling\r\ninnovation, but demanding merely the strict observance of a rule long\r\nrecognized. During most of John’s reign, a court did sit at Westminster\r\ndispensing justice, with more or less regularity; and there most “common\r\npleas” were tried, unless John ordered otherwise.[536] Magna Carta\r\ninsisted that all exceptions must cease; the rule of law must supersede\r\nthe royal caprice.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 535:\r\n\r\n  _Jurisprudence and Ethics_, 209. Sometimes, however, another “fixed\r\n  place” was substituted. The Court of Common Pleas once sat at York\r\n  under Edward III. and at Hertford under Elizabeth. See Maitland,\r\n  _Select Pleas of the Crown_, xiii. The Statute 2 Edward III. c. 11,\r\n  enacted that it should not be removed to any new place without due\r\n  notice.\r\n\r\nFootnote 536:\r\n\r\n  See Prof. Maitland, _Select Pleas of the Crown_, xiii.-xvi.\r\n\r\nIII. _Effects of Magna Carta on the genesis of the three Courts of\r\nCommon Law._ The ultimate consequences of the accomplishment of this\r\nreform reached further than was foreseen. Intended merely to remove from\r\nlitigants a practical grievance of frequent occurrence, it had important\r\nindirect effects on the development of the English Constitution. By\r\nsecuring for common pleas a permanent home, it gave an impetus to the\r\ndisintegrating tendencies already at work within the many-sided\r\nhousehold of the king. It contributed somewhat to the slow process\r\nwhereby the _Curia Regis_, as an administrative organ, was\r\ndifferentiated from the same _Curia_ as the dispenser of justice. It\r\nhelped forward the cleavage destined to divide completely the future\r\nCourts of Westminster from the Court of St. James’s and from Downing\r\nStreet. Nor was this all: the special treatment accorded to “common\r\npleas” emphasized the distinction between them and royal pleas, and so\r\ncontributed to the splitting up of the same _Curia Regis_, on its\r\njudicial side, into two distinct tribunals. One little group of judges\r\nwere set apart for hearing common pleas, and were known as \"the king’s\r\nJudges of the Bench,\" or more briefly as “the Bench,” and at a later\r\ndate as the Court of Common Pleas. A second group, reserved for royal\r\npleas, became the court _Coram Rege_, known subsequently as the Court of\r\nKing’s Bench. There were thus two benches: a common bench for common\r\npleas and a royal bench for pleas of the Crown.[537]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 537:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, 109.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe double process by which these two small courts separated themselves\r\nslowly from the parent court and from each other began long prior to\r\nMagna Carta, and was not completed before the close of the thirteenth\r\ncentury. These benches were also closely linked with a third bench,\r\nknown for centuries as the Court of Exchequer, which was in its origin\r\nmerely one department of that government bureau, the king’s financial\r\nExchequer—that office in which money was weighed and tested and the\r\nroyal accounts drawn up. Many disputes or pleas affecting Crown debts\r\nand debtors had to be there decided, and in due time a special group of\r\nofficials were set aside to try these. These men, called, not judges,\r\nbut “barons of the exchequer,” formed what was in fact, though not in\r\nname, a third bench or court of justice.\r\n\r\nAll three of the Courts of Common Law—the Court of King’s Bench, the\r\nCourt of Common Pleas, and the Court of Exchequer—were thus offshoots of\r\nthe king’s household. In theory, each of these ought to have confined\r\nitself to the special class of suits to which it owed its origin—to\r\nroyal pleas, common pleas, and exchequer pleas respectively; but by a\r\nprocess well known to lawyers and law-courts in all ages, each of them\r\neagerly encroached on the jurisdictions and the fees appropriate to the\r\nothers, until they became, for most purposes, three sister courts of\r\nsimilar and co-ordinate authority. They were bound to decide all suits\r\naccording to the technical and inflexible rules of common law; and their\r\njurisdiction thus required a supplement, which was supplied by the\r\ngenesis of the Court of Chancery, dispensing, not common law, but\r\nequity, which professed to give (and, for a short time, actually did\r\ngive) redress on the merits of each case as it arose, unrestrained by\r\nprecedents and legal subtleties.\r\n\r\nIV. _The Evolution of the Court of Common Pleas._ The comment usually\r\nmade upon the present chapter is that we have here the origin of the\r\nCourt of Common Pleas. Now, legal institutions do not spring,\r\nfull-fledged, into being. The Court of Common Pleas, like its sister\r\nCourts of King’s Bench and Exchequer, was the result of a long process\r\nof gradual separation from a common parent stem. Prior to 1215 several\r\ntentative efforts seem to have been made towards establishing each of\r\nthese. On the other hand, it is probable, nay certain, that long after\r\n1215 the Court of Common Pleas did not completely shake off either its\r\nearly dependence upon the _Curia Regis_, or yet its close connection\r\nwith its sister tribunals.\r\n\r\nThree stages in the process of evolution may be emphasized. (1) The\r\nearliest trace of the existence of a definite bench of judges, set apart\r\nfor trying common pleas, is to be found in 1178, not in 1215. When Henry\r\nII. returned from Normandy in the former year, he found that there had\r\nbeen irregularities in his absence. To prevent their recurrence, he\r\neffected certain changes in his judicial arrangements, the exact nature\r\nof which is matter of dispute. A contemporary writer[538] relates how\r\nHenry chose two clerks and three laymen from the officials of his own\r\nhousehold, and gave to these five men authority to hear all complaints\r\nand to do right “_and not to recede from his court_.” It was long\r\nthought that this marked the origin of the Court of King’s Bench, but\r\nMr. Pike[539] has conclusively proved that the bench thus established\r\nwas the predecessor, not of the royal bench, but rather of the bench for\r\ncommon pleas.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 538:\r\n\r\n  The chronicler known as Benedict Abbot, I. 107 (Rolls Series).\r\n\r\nFootnote 539:\r\n\r\n  _House of Lords_, 32.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn 1178, then, these five judges were set apart to hear ordinary suits;\r\nbut they were specially directed not to leave Henry’s court; so that\r\ncommon pleas still “followed the king,” even ordinary litigants in\r\nnon-royal pleas having to pursue the king in quest of justice as he\r\npassed from place to place in quest of sport.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the arrangement thus made in 1178 settled\r\nthe practice for the whole period of thirty-seven years preceding the\r\ngrant of Magna Carta. On the contrary, it was merely one of many\r\nexperiments tried by that restless reformer, Henry of Anjou; and the\r\nseparate court then instituted may have been pulled down and set up\r\nagain many times. The bench which appears in 1178 had probably, at best,\r\na fitful and intermittent existence. There is evidence, however, that\r\nsome such court did exist and did try common pleas in the reigns of\r\nRichard and John.[540] On the other hand, this tribunal had in John’s\r\nreign ceased to follow the king’s movements habitually (thus\r\ndisregarding the decree of 1178), and had established itself at\r\nWestminster.[541] It was in 1215 considered an abuse for John to try a\r\ncommon plea elsewhere. Times had changed since his father had granted as\r\na boon that a set of judges should remain constantly at “his court” to\r\ntry such cases.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 540:\r\n\r\n  See Prof. Maitland, _Sel. Pl. Crown_, xiii.-xvi.; see also in _Pipe\r\n  Roll_, 7 John (cited Madox, I. 791) how money was paid that a plea\r\n  pending before the _Justiciarii de banco_ might be heard _coram rege_.\r\n  This entry proves that in 1205 there were two distinct courts, one\r\n  known as _de banco_ and the other as _coram rege_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 541:\r\n\r\n  See Maitland, _Ibid._\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(2) Magna Carta in 1215 gave authoritative sanction to the already\r\nrecognized rule that common pleas should be tried at Westminster,\r\ninstead of moving with the king. No exceptions were henceforth to be\r\nallowed. Young Henry renewed this promise, and the circumstance of his\r\nminority favoured its strict observance. A mere boy could not make royal\r\nprogresses through the land dispensing justice as he went. Accordingly,\r\nall pleas continued for some twenty years to be heard at Westminster.\r\nThe same circumstances, which thus emphasized the stability of common\r\npleas (along with all other kinds of pleas) in one fixed place, may have\r\narrested the process of cleavage between the two benches. All the judges\r\nof both courts sat at Westminster, and therefore there was the less need\r\nfor allocating the business between them with any exactitude. The two\r\nbenches were in danger of coalescing.\r\n\r\n(3) About the year 1234 a third stage was reached. Henry began to follow\r\nthe precedent, set by his ancestors, of moving through his realm with\r\njudges in his train, hearing pleas wherever he stopped. While one group\r\nof judges went with him, another remained at Westminster. Some way of\r\nallocating the business had therefore to be found. Common pleas, in\r\naccordance with Magna Carta, remained stationary; while pleas of the\r\nCrown went on their travels. The split between the two benches now\r\nbecame absolute. Each provided itself with separate records. From the\r\nyear 1234, two continuous series of distinct rolls can be traced, known\r\nrespectively as _rotuli placitorum coram rege_ and _rotuli placitorum de\r\nbanco_. If any date in the history of one law court, which is in process\r\nof becoming two, can be reckoned as specially marking the point of\r\nseparation, it should be that at which separate rolls appear. The\r\ncourt’s _memory_ lies in its records, which are thus closely associated\r\nwith its identity. In 1234 the common bench and the royal bench had\r\nbecome distinct.[542] Evidence drawn from a few years later proves that\r\na definition of common pleas had been arrived at and that the rule which\r\nrequired them to be held “in a fixed place” was insisted on. While Henry\r\nand his justices sat in judgment at Worcester in 1238, a litigant\r\nprotested against his suit being tried before them. It was a “common\r\nplea” and therefore, he argued, ought not to follow the king, in\r\nviolation of Magna Carta. At Westminster only, not at Worcester or\r\nelsewhere, could his case be heard.[543]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 542:\r\n\r\n  See Maitland, _Sel. Pl. Crown_, xviii.\r\n\r\nFootnote 543:\r\n\r\n  See _Placitorum Abbreviatio_ (p. 105) 21 Henry III., cited Pike,\r\n  _House of Lords_, p. 41. Cf. also Bracton’s _Note Book_, pleas Nos.\r\n  1213 and 1220.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWith royal pleas, however, it was very different: for long they\r\ncontinued to follow the king’s person without any protest being raised;\r\nand the Court of King’s Bench did not finally settle at Westminster for\r\nnearly a century after the Court of Common Pleas had been established\r\nthere. So late as 1300, Edward I. ordained by the _Articuli super\r\ncartas_ that “the Justices of his Bench” (as well as his Chancellor)\r\nshould follow him so that he might have at all times near him “some\r\nsages of the law, which be able duly to order all such matters as shall\r\ncome into the Court at all times when need shall require.”[544]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 544:\r\n\r\n  28 Edward I. c. 5.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nV. _Erroneous Views._ In the reign of Edward I. the real motive of this\r\nchapter of Magna Charta—so quickly had the organization of the law\r\ncourts progressed—had already been lost sight of. The day of wandering\r\ncommon pleas, such as that of Richard d’Anesty, had been long forgotten.\r\nSome litigants of Edward’s time had, however, a different grievance of\r\ntheir own, connected with the hearing of their suits. The Court of\r\nExchequer was willing, for an adequate consideration, to place its\r\nspecially potent machinery, devised originally for the king’s exclusive\r\nuse, at the disposal of private creditors, thus treating “common pleas”\r\nas “exchequer pleas.” Ordinary debtors, summoned as defendants before\r\nthe _barones scaccarii_, were subjected to harsher treatment than they\r\nwould have experienced elsewhere. It was not unnatural that defendants\r\nwho found themselves thus hustled should read the words of Magna Carta\r\nrelative to “common pleas” as precisely suited to their own case. They\r\nmade this mistake the more readily as the original motive had been\r\nforgotten. The Charter was thus read as preventing the stationary Court\r\nof Exchequer (not the constantly moving King’s Bench) from hearing\r\nordinary suits. This erroneous view received legislative sanction. The\r\n_Articuli super cartas_ in 1300 declared that no common pleas should\r\nthenceforth be held in the Exchequer “contrary to the form of the Great\r\nCharter.”[545]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 545:\r\n\r\n  See 28 Edward I. c. 4. Many previous attempts had been made to keep\r\n  common pleas out of the Exchequer _e.g._ the writs of 56 Henry III.\r\n  and 5 Edward I. (cited Madox, II. 73-4) the so-called statute of\r\n  Rhuddlan (12 Edward I., see _Statutes of Realm_, I. 70). Madox also\r\n  (II. 73-4) takes the erroneous view that c. 17 of the Great Charter\r\n  relates to the Exchequer; so does Mr. Bigelow (_History of Procedure_,\r\n  130–1), who goes further astray by explaining the point of the\r\n  grievance as the difficulty of getting speedy justice at the\r\n  Exchequer, because the barons refused to sit after their fiscal\r\n  business had been finished, at the Easter and Michaelmas sessions.\r\n  This is an error: the Barons of Exchequer made no difficulty about\r\n  hearing pleas: quite the contrary. Plaintiffs were equally eager to\r\n  purchase the writs which they were keen to sell: it was only\r\n  defendants (debtors) who objected to the rapid and stringent procedure\r\n  for enforcing payment adopted by this efficient court. The sheriffs\r\n  and others waiting to render accounts before the Exchequer also\r\n  protested against the congestion of business produced at the Exchequer\r\n  by the eagerness of litigants who pressed there for justice. See\r\n  Madox, II. 73. Plaintiffs had no reason to complain.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis is a clear misinterpretation of the intention of Magna Carta. The\r\nExchequer never “followed the Crown”; it stayed at Westminster where its\r\noffices, tallies, and pipe rolls were. The Charter would have expressed\r\nitself in widely different words if it had desired to exclude common\r\npleas from the Exchequer. The _Articuli super Cartas_, however,\r\nattempted what the Charter of 1215 did not. After 1300 it was clearly\r\nillegal to hold any pleas in the Exchequer, unless such as affected the\r\nCrown and its ministers. Subsequent statutes confirmed this; but their\r\nplain intention was always defeated by the ingenious use of legal\r\nfictions and the connivance of the Barons of Exchequer, who welcomed the\r\nincrease of their fees which kept pace with the increase of\r\nbusiness.[546]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 546:\r\n\r\n  The fiction of “Crown debtors” is well known: plaintiffs obtained a\r\n  hearing in the Exchequer for their common pleas by alleging that they\r\n  wished to recover debts due to them “in order to enable them to answer\r\n  the debts they owed to the king.” See Madox, II. 192.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe evil directly attacked by Magna Carta was something quite\r\ndifferent—an evil wider, more pressing and less technical, namely, the\r\npractice of causing ordinary litigants, with their legal advisers and\r\nwitnesses, to dance attendance on a constantly moving court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\r\n\r\nRecogniciones de nova dissaisina, de morte antecessoris, et de ultima\r\npresentacione, non capiantur nisi in suis comitatibus et hoc modo; nos,\r\nvel si extra regnum fuerimus, capitalis justiciarius noster, mittemus\r\nduos justiciarios per unumquemque comitatum per quatuor vices in anno,\r\nqui, cum quatuor militibus cujuslibet comitatus electis per comitatum,\r\ncapiant in comitatu et in die et loco comitatus assisas predictas.\r\n\r\n  Inquests of _novel disseisin_, of _mort d’ancestor_, and of _darrein\r\n  presentment_, shall not be held elsewhere than in their own\r\n  county-courts,[547] and that in manner following,—We, or, if we should\r\n  be out of the realm, our chief justiciar, will send two justiciars\r\n  through every county four times a year, who shall, along with four\r\n  knights of the county chosen by the county, hold the said assizes[548]\r\n  in the county court, on the day and in the place of meeting of that\r\n  court.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 547:\r\n\r\n  “_Comitatus_” indicates both the county where the lands lay and the\r\n  court of that county. It was originally the sphere of influence of a\r\n  comes or earl. Cf. _supra_, c. 2, (p. 238, n.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 548:\r\n\r\n  “The _said_ assizes” were previously called, not assizes but\r\n  “inquests” (_recogniciones_), a wider term of which the three petty\r\n  assizes here named were three special applications.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nProvision is thus made for holding before the king’s travelling\r\njustices, frequently and in a convenient manner, three species of\r\njudicial inquests known as “the three petty assizes.” These are of\r\nexceptional interest, not only in relation to Magna Carta, but from\r\ntheir intimate connection with several constitutional problems of prime\r\nimportance; with the reforms of Henry II. on the one hand, and with the\r\ngenesis of trial by jury and of the Justices of Assize on the other.\r\n\r\nI. _The Curia Regis and the travelling Justices._ From an early date,\r\ncertainly from the accession of Henry I., it was the Crown’s practice to\r\nsupplement the labours which its officials conducted within the\r\nprecincts of the royal exchequer by the occasional despatch of chosen\r\nindividuals to inspect the provinces in the royal interests, collecting\r\ninformation and revenue, and, incidentally, hearing lawsuits. Justice\r\nwas thus dispensed in the king’s name by his delegates in every shire of\r\nEngland, and a distinction arose between two types of royal courts: (1)\r\n_the King’s Council and its offshoots_ (including the three courts of\r\ncommon law and the court of chancery) which at first followed the king’s\r\nperson, but gradually, as already shown,[549] found a settled home at\r\nWestminster; and (2) _the courts of the itinerant justices_ which\r\nexercised such delegated authority as the Crown chose from time to time\r\nto entrust to them. The natural sphere of the labours of these royal\r\ncommissioners as they passed from district to district was the court of\r\neach shire, specially convened to meet them. They formed in this way the\r\nchief link between the old local popular courts and the system of royal\r\njustice organized by Henry II.,[550] subordinating the former to the\r\nlatter, until the county courts virtually became royal courts. These\r\ntravelling justices passed through two stages, two different types\r\nreceiving royal recognition at different periods, the Justices in Eyre\r\nand the Justices of Assize respectively.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 549:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, c. 17.\r\n\r\nFootnote 550:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, p. 106.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The Justices in Eyre_ were the earliest form of travelling\r\njudges, though their original duties were rather financial and\r\nadministrative, than strictly judicial. Their history extends from the\r\nreign of Henry I. to the end of the fourteenth century.[551] Their\r\noutstanding characteristics were the sweeping nature of the commissions\r\nunder which they acted (_ad omnia placita_), the harsh and drastic way\r\nin which they used their authority, and their intense unpopularity.\r\nTheir advent was dreaded like a pestilence: each district they visited\r\nwas left impoverished by fines and penalties. On one occasion, the men\r\nof Cornwall “from fear of their coming, fled to the woods.”[552]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 551:\r\n\r\n  See W. S. Houldsworth (_History of English Law_, p. 115), who cites\r\n  1397 as the date of the final abolition of Eyres.\r\n\r\nFootnote 552:\r\n\r\n  This was in 1233: see Pollock and Maitland, I. 181.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAn eyre was only resorted to at long intervals—every seven years came to\r\nbe the recognized term—and was intended as a severe method of punishing\r\ndelinquencies and miscarriages of justice occurring since the last one,\r\nand of collecting arrears of royal dues. It was not a visit from these\r\nuniversally-hated Justices of Eyre that the barons in 1215 demanded four\r\ntimes a year.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The Justices of Assize_ were also travelling judges, but in their\r\noriginal form at least, possessed hardly another feature in common with\r\nthe Justices in Eyre. Their history extends from a period not earlier\r\nthan the reign of Henry II. down to the present day.[553] They seem to\r\nhave been popular from the first, as their primary function was to\r\ndetermine pending suits by a rational and acceptable form of procedure;\r\nwhile the scope of their jurisdiction, although gradually extended as\r\ntheir popularity increased, was at all times limited strictly by the\r\nexpress terms of their commissions. They were regarded not as royal\r\ntax-gatherers armed with harsh powers of coercion, but as welcome\r\nbearers of justice to the doors of those who needed it.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 553:\r\n\r\n  Blackstone, _Commentaries_, III. 58, assigns 1176, (the assize of\r\n  Northampton) as the date of their institution.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAt first their duties were confined to one species of judicial work,\r\nnamely, to presiding at enquiries of the kind specially mentioned in the\r\ntext. These particular inquests were known as “assizes,” and the new\r\nspecies of travelling judges were hence called “Justices of Assize,” a\r\nname which has clung to them for centuries, although their jurisdiction\r\nhas been gradually increased till it now includes both civil and\r\ncriminal pleas of every description, and although meanwhile the\r\ninvention of new forms of process has superseded the old “assizes,” and\r\nat last necessitated their total abolition.[554] They are still\r\n“justices of assize” in an age which knows nothing of assizes.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 554:\r\n\r\n  See Statute 3 and 4 William IV. c. 27 §§ 36-7. The last actual case of\r\n  a Grand Assize occurred in _Davies_ v. _Loundes_, in 1835 and 1838 (1\r\n  Bing. N. C. 597, and 5 Bing. N. C. 161).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nII. _The Nature and Origin of the three Petty Assizes._ The institution\r\nof the \"assizes\"—particular forms of the sworn inquest—occupied a\r\nprominent place among the expedients by which Henry II. hoped to\r\nsubstitute a more rational procedure for the form of proof known as\r\ntrial by combat.[555]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 555:\r\n\r\n  The name “Assize” is sometimes a source of confusion, because of the\r\n  various meanings which attach to it. (1) Originally it denoted a\r\n  session or meeting of any sort. (2) It came to be specially reserved\r\n  for sessions of the king’s Council. (3) It was applied to any\r\n  Ordinance enacted by the king in such a session, _e.g._ the Assize of\r\n  Clarendon or the Assize of Northampton. (4) It was extended to every\r\n  institution or procedure established by such royal ordinance, but (5)\r\n  more particularly applied to the institutions or procedures known as\r\n  the Grand Assize, and the Petty Assizes, from which the “Justices of\r\n  Assize” took their name. (6) Finally, it denotes at the present day a\r\n  “session” of these Justices of Assize, thus combining something of its\r\n  earliest meaning with something of its latest. In certain contexts it\r\n  has other meanings still, _e.g._ (7) an assessment or financial burden\r\n  imposed at a “session” of the king’s council or of some other\r\n  authority.\r\n\r\nThe _duellum_, introduced at the Norman Conquest, remained for a century\r\nthereafter the chief method in use among the upper classes for\r\ndetermining all serious pleas or litigations. Gradually, however, it was\r\nconfined to two important groups of pleas, one civil and the other\r\ncriminal: namely, appeals of treason and felony on the one hand, and\r\nsuits to determine the title to land on the other.[556] This process of\r\nrestriction was accelerated by the deliberate policy of Henry II., who\r\nattempted, indeed, to carry it much further, devising machinery which\r\nprovided for the defendant or accused party, wherever possible, an\r\noption by resorting to which he could, in an ever increasing variety of\r\ncircumstances, escape trial by battle altogether. Under chapter 36 will\r\nbe explained the expedient adopted for evading combat in an appeal of\r\ntreason or felony. The present chapter relates to the procedure devised\r\nby Henry for superseding the _duellum_ in certain important groups of\r\ncivil pleas,[557] and incidentally affords proof that this part of his\r\nreforms had already become popular with the opponents of the Crown. The\r\nfrequent use of the three Petty Assizes was now insisted on, although\r\nthe Grand Assize was still viewed askance for reasons to be explained in\r\nconnection with chapter 34.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 556:\r\n\r\n  See Neilson, _Trial by Combat_, 33–6, and authorities there cited.\r\n\r\nFootnote 557:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, pp. 103-4 for the place of “combat” in legal procedure;\r\n  and pp. 108-9 for Henry’s policy in discouraging it. For the later\r\n  history of trial by battle, see _infra_, under c. 36.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(1) _The Grand Assize_ is not mentioned in Magna Carta; but some\r\nacquaintance with it is a necessary preliminary to a proper appreciation\r\nof the Petty Assizes. In the troubled reign of Stephen—which was rather\r\nthe reign of anarchy in his name—lands changed hands frequently. This\r\nleft to his successor a legacy of quarrels, too often leading to\r\nbloodshed. There was hardly an important estate in England to which, at\r\nHenry’s accession, two or more rival magnates did not lay claim.\r\nConstant litigations resulted, and the only legal method of deciding the\r\nissue was the _duellum_.\r\n\r\nAt some uncertain date, near the commencement of his reign, Henry II.\r\nintroduced a startling innovation. The holder of a property _de facto_\r\n(that is the man in actual enjoyment of the estate in virtue of a _bona\r\nfide_ title), when challenged to combat by a rival claimant was allowed\r\nan option: he might force the claimant (if the latter persisted) to\r\nrefer the whole matter to the oath of twelve knights of the\r\nneighbourhood. Henry’s ordinance laid down careful rules for the\r\nappointment of these recognitors. Four leading knights of the whole\r\ncounty were first to be chosen, on whom was placed the duty of selecting\r\ntwelve knights of the particular district where the lands lay, and\r\nthese, with all due solemnity and in presence of the king’s justiciars,\r\ndeclared upon oath to which suitor the lands belonged. Their decision\r\nwas final, and determined the question of ownership for all time\r\ncoming.[558] The name Grand Assize was applied alike to the procedure\r\nand to the knights who gave the verdict. The twelve knights thus\r\nanticipated the functions of a modern jury, while the king’s justiciars\r\nacted like the presiding judge at a modern trial.[559]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 558:\r\n\r\n  See Glanvill, II. 7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 559:\r\n\r\n  The various steps in the procedure ought to be clearly grasped, (_a_)\r\n  A claimant challenged the title of the actual tenant in the court\r\n  baron of the lord, from whom the tenement was held, and offered battle\r\n  by a champion, who was supposed to be a witness. (_b_) The tenant (now\r\n  become a defendant) applied to the king for a royal writ, the issue of\r\n  which, _ipso facto_, stopped all procedure in the court baron, (_c_)\r\n  The claimant (plaintiff) had thus to make the next move; and Henry’s\r\n  ordinance left only one move which he could make, namely to apply for\r\n  a new royal writ, but one of a different kind. This new writ referred\r\n  the question of title to twelve knights of the Grand Assize. (_d_)\r\n  Before these could be appointed and give their verdict, many\r\n  formalities and delays necessarily intervened, involving expensive\r\n  journeys to the king’s _Curia_, first by the four appointing knights\r\n  and afterwards by the twelve appointed. Months and even years might\r\n  elapse before the final verdict was obtained. This ingenious reform,\r\n  while superseding trial by battle, incidentally superseded also the\r\n  jurisdiction of mesne lords. Hence the Grand Assize never became\r\n  popular with the magnates. Cf. under c. 34.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nValuable as was this innovation, it had one obvious defect. The option\r\nit conferred might sometimes be usurped by the wrong man. It was\r\nintended to operate in the interests of order and justice by favouring\r\nthe peaceable holder _de facto_; but what if a turbulent and lawless\r\nclaimant, scorning an appeal to legal process, took the law into his own\r\nhands, evicted the previous holder by the rude method of self-help, and\r\nthereafter claimed the protection of Henry’s ordinance? In such a case\r\nthe man of violence—the holder _mala fide_—would enjoy the option\r\nintended for his innocent victim.\r\n\r\n(2) _The petty assizes_ may, perhaps, be regarded as the outcome of\r\nHenry’s determination to prevent such misuse of his new engine of\r\njustice. If one claimant alleged that the other had usurped his rights\r\nby violence or fraud, the king allowed the preliminary plea thus raised\r\nto be summarily decided by the oath of twelve local landowners,\r\naccording to a procedure known as a petty assize. These petty assizes,\r\nof which there were three kinds, all related to questions of\r\n“possession,” as opposed to questions of “ownership,” which could only\r\nbe determined by battle or by the Grand Assize.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The assize of novel disseisin._ The word “seisin,” originally\r\nsynonymous with “possession” in general, was gradually restricted by\r\nmedieval lawyers to the possession of real estate. “Disseisin” thus\r\nmeant the interruption of seisin or possession of land; and was the\r\ntechnical term applied to such violent acts of eviction as were likely\r\nto defeat the intention of Henry’s ordinance of the Grand Assize.\r\n“Novel” disseisin implied that such violent ejection was of\r\ncomparatively recent date, for a summary remedy could only be given\r\nwhere there had not been undue delay in applying for it. The first of\r\nthe petty assizes, then, was a rapid and peaceable method of\r\nascertaining by reference to sworn local testimony whether an alleged\r\nrecent eviction had really taken place or not. Without any of the law’s\r\ndelays, without any expensive journeys to the king’s Court or to\r\nWestminster, but in a rapid manner and in the district where the lands\r\nlay, twelve local gentlemen determined upon oath all allegations of this\r\nnature. If the recognitors of the petty assize answered “Yes,” then the\r\nevicted man would have “seisin” immediately restored to him, and along\r\nwith “seisin” went the valued option of determining what proof should\r\ndecide the \"ownership\"—whether it should be battle or the Grand Assize.\r\nAn ordinance instituting this most famous of the three petty assizes was\r\nissued probably in 1166, a year fertile in legal expedients, and formed\r\na necessary supplement to the ordinance of the Grand Assize, preventing\r\nall danger that the option intended for the man of peace should be\r\nusurped by the man of violence.[560]\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The assize of mort d’ancestor._ The protection afforded to the\r\nvictim of a “novel disseisin” did not remove all possibility of justice\r\nmiscarrying. Interested parties, other than the man forcibly ejected,\r\neven his heirs, were left unprotected. Further, an heir might be\r\nforcibly deprived of his tenement either by his lord or by some other\r\nrival claimant before he had an opportunity to take possession; never\r\nhaving been “in seisin,” he could not plead that he had suffered\r\n“disseisin.” For the benefit of such an heir, a second petty assize,\r\nknown as \"mort d’ancestor,\" was invented.[561] This is mentioned in\r\narticle 4 of the Assize of Northampton, an ordinance issued by Henry in\r\n1176; and this earliest known reference probably marks its origin.\r\nProcedure, essentially similar to, though not quite so speedy or\r\ninformal as, that already described was thus put at the heir’s disposal.\r\nIf successful, he took the lands temporarily, subject to all defects in\r\nhis ancestor’s title, leaving as before the question of absolute\r\nownership to be determined (if challenged) by the more cumbrous\r\nmachinery of the Grand Assize.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 560:\r\n\r\n  The date of the ordinance of the Grand Assize is not known. It has\r\n  been argued that its origin may be traced to an earlier date than that\r\n  of the assize of novel disseisin (see Mr. J. H. Round in the\r\n  _Athenaeum_ for 28th January, 1899); but in any case the _logical_\r\n  sequence seems to be that given in the text. The question of\r\n  _chronological_ sequence is still open.\r\n\r\nFootnote 561:\r\n\r\n  At so late a date as 1267 it was found necessary to recognize by\r\n  statute the right of the heir who had come of age to oust his guardian\r\n  from his lands by an assize of _mort d’ancestor_. See Statute of\r\n  Marlborough, c. 16.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _The assize of darrein presentment._ Advowson or the right of\r\nappointing the incumbent to a vacant church benefice was then, as now, a\r\nspecies of real estate. Such patronage was highly prized, affording as\r\nit did an opportunity of providing a living for a younger son or needy\r\nrelative; or it might be converted into ready cash. Disputes often arose\r\nboth as to the possession and as to the ownership of advowsons. Any one\r\nwho claimed the absolute right or property as against the holder must do\r\nso by battle or the Grand Assize, exactly as in the case of any other\r\nform of real estate; and the Charter says nothing on this head.[562] On\r\nthe other hand, the less vital question of possession might be more\r\nrapidly determined. If a benefice fell vacant, and each of two\r\nproprietors claimed the patronage, the Church could not remain without a\r\nshepherd, for years perhaps, until the question of title was decided.\r\nNo; the man in possession was allowed to make the appointment. But who\r\nwas the man in possession? Clearly he who had (or whose father had)\r\npresented a nominee to the living when the last vacancy occurred. Even\r\nhere there was room for dispute as to the facts. Twelve local men\r\ndecided which claimant had actually made the last appointment (the\r\n“darrein presentment”); and the claimant thus preferred had a legal\r\nright to fill up vacancies, remaining in possession until someone proved\r\na better title by battle or the Grand Assize.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 562:\r\n\r\n  Such was the law as late as 1285. The Statute of Westminster II. (13\r\n  Edward I. c. 5) authoritatively explains that, when any one had\r\n  wrongfully presented a clerk to a vacant church, the real patron could\r\n  not recover his advowson except by a writ of right “_quod habet\r\n  terminari per duellum vel per magnam assisam_.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAll three forms of the petty assize were merely new applications by\r\nHenry Plantagenet of the royal procedure known in England, since the\r\nNorman Conquest, as _inquisitio_ or _recognitio_.[563]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 563:\r\n\r\n  The relations of the assizes to the ancient _inquisitio_ and to the\r\n  modern jury are discussed _supra_, pp. 158-163.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIII. _The Assizes in 1215._ The petty assizes, when invented by Henry\r\nII., were resented bitterly as innovations; but public opinion, half a\r\ncentury later, had abundantly vindicated the wisdom of this part of his\r\nreforms. The insurgent barons in 1215 were far from demanding their\r\nabolition; their new grievance was rather that sessions of the justices\r\nof assize were not held often enough. They prescribed the way in which\r\nthese assizes, now grown so popular, were to be held, and several points\r\nwere specially emphasized. (1) No inquiry of the kind was to be held\r\nelsewhere than in the county where the property was situated. Justice\r\nwas in such cases to be brought to every landowner’s door, although\r\npleas of the Crown might still follow the king, and ordinary common\r\npleas had to be taken to Westminster. This was intended to save expense\r\nand to meet the convenience of litigants, of those who served on\r\nassizes, and of all concerned.[564] Within two years, however, it was\r\nseen that this provision went too far. It was more convenient to hold\r\ncertain inquiries before the Bench at Westminster than in the particular\r\nlocality. The reissue of 1217 therefore made two important\r\nmodifications: (_a_) All assizes of darrein presentment were thereafter\r\nto be taken before “the Justices of the Bench.” (_b_) Any assize of\r\nnovel disseisin or of mort d’ancestor revealing points of special\r\ndifficulty, might also be reserved for the decision of the Bench. An\r\nelement of uncertainty was thus introduced, of which the Crown took\r\nadvantage. In a reported case of the year 1221 it was decided that an\r\nassize of mort d’ancestor should be held in its own county, not at\r\nWestminster.[565]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 564:\r\n\r\n  Thus two successive chapters of Magna Carta emphasize two divergent\r\n  tendencies: c. 17 had demanded that “common pleas” should all be held\r\n  at Westminster, while c. 18 demands that “assizes” should _not_ be\r\n  taken there. In both cases, the object was to consult the convenience\r\n  of litigants.\r\n\r\nFootnote 565:\r\n\r\n  See Bracton’s _Note Book_, case No. 1478; a case also cited by Coke\r\n  (_Second Institute, proem._). If this assize had presented points of\r\n  special difficulty it might have been held at Westminster without\r\n  violating Magna Carta.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(2) John’s Charter further insists on quarterly circuits of Justices of\r\nAssize; so that litigants in every county of England might have four\r\nopportunities each year of having their disputes amicably settled. Such\r\nexcessive frequency was quite uncalled for, and involved unnecessary\r\nexpense on the king, and an amount of labour on his officers out of all\r\nproportion to the good effected. The Charter of 1217, accordingly,\r\nprovided that a circuit should be made only once a year. In 1285,\r\nhowever, it was enacted that they might be held three times a year, but\r\nnot oftener.[566]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 566:\r\n\r\n  13 Edward I. c. 30. Stephen, _History of Criminal Law_, 105–7, gives\r\n  further details.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(3) The Charter speaks of the two justices and of the four county\r\nknights, but says nothing of the twelve knights from the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the disputed property. The omission has no special\r\nsignificance. Magna Carta had no directions to convey on this matter,\r\nand therefore it kept silence; but the presence of the twelve must have\r\nbeen presumed, since their verdict formed the essential feature of the\r\nentire procedure.[567] The twelve formed the jury, and the two justices\r\nwere the judges, while the chief duty of the four was to select the\r\ntwelve. The chapter directed the justices “to hold the assizes along\r\nwith the four knights”; but it does not appear whether the latter were\r\nto sit as local assessors of the court, or to serve along with the\r\ntwelve recognitors, or to act as a link between the two.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 567:\r\n\r\n  See Assize of Northampton, c. 4.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(4) One fact about them was clearly stated, namely, the mode of their\r\nappointment. The four knights were to be “elected” in the county court\r\n(_cum quatuor militibus ... electis per comitatum_), and much emphasis\r\nhas been laid on this provision by historians searching for ancient\r\nprototypes of modern institutions. These knights have been warmly\r\nwelcomed as county magistrates elected on a more or less extended\r\nsuffrage.[568]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 568:\r\n\r\n  See, _e.g._ Stubbs, _preface_ to R. Hoveden, IV. xcviii.; Blackstone,\r\n  _Great Charter_, xxxvi.; Medley, _Engl. Const. History_, 130.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAs the provisions of the reissue of 1217 are more carelessly expressed,\r\nand as in particular they contain no word implying “election,” it has\r\nbeen assumed that a change in the mode of appointment was intended; that\r\na step tentatively taken towards representative local government in 1215\r\nwas deliberately retraced two years later.[569] “_Electus_” however, in\r\nmedieval Latin was a vague word, differing widely from the ideas usually\r\nassociated with a modern “election,” and applied indiscriminately to all\r\nmethods of appointment or selection, even to the proceedings of officers\r\nengaged by Edward I. to compel the enlistment of the best soldiers\r\navailable for his army. The twelve knights were to be “appointed,” not\r\n“elected,” in the county court, and it remains doubtful whether the\r\nsheriff, the magnates, or the body of the suitors, would have secured\r\nthe chief share in the appointment. No evidence is forthcoming that any\r\nspecial importance was attached in 1217 to the use of the word\r\n“_electus_,” and its omission may have been due to inadvertence.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 569:\r\n\r\n  Blackstone, _Ibid._, points out these changes in the charter of 1217:\r\n  “the leaving indefinite the number of the knights and the justices of\r\n  assize, the abolishing of the election of the former, and the reducing\r\n  the times of taking assizes to once in every year.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIV. _An Erroneous View._ Henry Hallam, commenting on this chapter,\r\nseems to have misapprehended the issues at stake. \"This clause stood\r\nopposed on the one hand to the encroachments of the king’s court,\r\nwhich might otherwise, by drawing pleas of land to itself, have\r\ndefeated the suitor’s right to a jury from the vicinage: and, on the\r\nother, to those of the feudal aristocracy, who hated any interference\r\nof the Crown to chastise their violations of law, or control their own\r\njurisdiction.\"[570] Hallam thus interprets the chapter as denoting a\r\ntriumph of the old local popular courts over both the king’s courts\r\nand the courts of the feudal magnates. It denoted no such thing, but\r\nmarked in reality a triumph (so far as it went) of the king’s courts\r\nover the tribunals of the feudal magnates—over the courts baron, as\r\nthey were afterwards called, the most important of the three courts\r\ninto which manorial jurisdictions afterwards split. The assizes, it is\r\ntrue, were to be taken in the county court, but they were to be taken\r\nthere by the king’s justices, not by the sheriff. The county courts by\r\nthis time had fallen completely under the domination of the king, and\r\nwere to all intents and purposes (and in especial for this purpose)\r\nroyal courts. The present chapter is thus conclusive evidence of the\r\ntriumph of the king’s justice over all rivals in three important\r\ngroups of pleas. Royal justice was the best article in the market,\r\nand, in spite of all defects, deserved the popularity which in this\r\nprovince it had evidently won, even among the barons whose\r\njurisdiction it was superseding.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 570:\r\n\r\n  See _Middle Ages_, II. 464.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nV. _Later History of the Justices of Assize._ Whatever may have been the\r\nexact date when there first went on tour throughout England travelling\r\njudges entitled to the description of “Justices of Assize,” such\r\ncircuits, once instituted, have continued to be held at more or less\r\nregular intervals from the beginning of the thirteenth century to the\r\npresent day. Their jurisdiction steadily widened under successive kings,\r\nfrom Henry II. to Edward III.; and they gradually superseded the older\r\nJustices of Eyre, taking over such of their functions as were not\r\ninconsistent with the change that was gradually transforming the\r\nmedieval into the modern system of justice.[571] It was the custom for\r\nthe Crown to issue new commissions to the justices as they set out upon\r\neach new circuit. Five distinct types of such commissions conferred\r\njurisdiction over five different departments of judicial business.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 571:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Coke, _First Institute_, 293 b.: “As the power of justices of\r\n  assises by many acts of parliament and other commissions increased, so\r\n  these justices itinerant by little and little vanished away.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(1) _The commission of assize_ was the earliest of all, authorizing them\r\nto hold petty assizes, but not the grand assize. Of this sufficient has\r\nalready been said.\r\n\r\n(2) _The commission of nisi prius_ conferred a wider civil jurisdiction,\r\nembracing practically all the non-criminal pleas pending at the time in\r\nthe counties which they visited. These powers were originally based on\r\nthe terms of the Statute of Westminster II., which became law in\r\n1285,[572] and directed that all civil pleas (under certain exceptions)\r\nmight be heard in their own counties. Thenceforward most ordinary suits\r\nmight be tried either locally before the justices of assize, or else\r\nbefore the bench at Westminster. The statute directed, however, that\r\nsheriffs, in summoning jurors to Westminster, were only to do so\r\nconditionally—jurors were to attend there unless already (_nisi prius_)\r\nthe justices of assize had come into the county; that is, if the\r\njustices arrived meanwhile in the locality, the jurors and all others\r\nconcerned were saved a journey, and the pleas in question were heard on\r\nthe spot. The commissions under which the travelling justices heard\r\nlocally such civil pleas were therefore known as “Commissions of _nisi\r\nprius_.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 572:\r\n\r\n  13 Edward I. c. 30.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(3) _The commission of gaol delivery_ was, subsequently to 1299,\r\ninvariably conferred on the justices of assize, in accordance with a\r\nstatute of that year,[573] authorizing them to inspect all gaols and\r\nenquire into all charges against prisoners, and to set free those\r\nunjustly detained. Previously, similar powers had been spasmodically\r\nconferred on separate commissioners, sometimes quite unfit for such a\r\ntrust, who had too often abused their authority.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 573:\r\n\r\n  27 Edward I. c. 3.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(4) _Commissions of Oyer and Terminer_, issued spasmodically from as\r\nearly a date as 1285,[574] to more or less responsible individuals, were\r\nfrom 1329 onwards conferred exclusively on the justices of assize, who\r\nthus obtained authority[575] “to hear and determine” all criminal pleas\r\npending in the counties they visited. This, combined with the commission\r\nof gaol delivery, amounted to a full jurisdiction over crimes and\r\ncriminals of every kind and degree; just as the commissions of assize\r\nand _nisi prius_ combined gave them full jurisdiction over all civil\r\npleas.[576]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 574:\r\n\r\n  13 Edward I. c. 39; see Stephen, _Hist. Criminal Law_, p. 106.\r\n\r\nFootnote 575:\r\n\r\n  2 Edward III. c. 2. _Ibid._, 110.\r\n\r\nFootnote 576:\r\n\r\n  It is unnecessary to do more than notice the exceptional “commissions\r\n  of trailbaston,” supposed to date from the Statute of Rageman (1276),\r\n  conferring special powers for the suppression of powerful wrongdoers.\r\n  These were soon superseded by the commissions of oyer and terminer.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(5) _The ordinary commission of the peace_ was invariably issued to the\r\njustices of assize from the reign of Edward III., conferring on them\r\npowers similar to those of the local justices of peace in every county\r\nwhich they might visit.\r\n\r\nBy a process of the survival of the fittest the justices of assize, from\r\nthe small beginnings referred to in John’s Great Charter, thus gradually\r\ngathered to themselves the powers exercised originally by various rival\r\nsets of commissioners; and they have continued for many centuries to\r\nperform the functions conferred by these five different commissions,\r\nforming a characteristic and indispensable part of the judicial system\r\nof England.[577]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 577:\r\n\r\n  Mr. W. S. Holdsworth, _Hist. Eng. Law_, 116–123, gives an admirable\r\n  and concise account of the justices and their commissions. For fuller\r\n  information see Stephen, _Hist. Criminal Law_, I. 97-111.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER NINETEEN.\r\n\r\nEt si in die comitatus assise predicte capi non possint, tot milites et\r\nlibere tenentes remaneant de illis qui interfuerint comitatui die illo,\r\nper quos possint judicia sufficienter fieri, secundum quod negocium\r\nfuerit majus vel minus.\r\n\r\n  And if any of the said assizes cannot be taken on the day of the\r\n  county court, let there remain of the knights and freeholders who were\r\n  present at the county court on that day, as many as may be required\r\n  for the efficient making of judgments, according as the business be\r\n  more or less.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis supplement to the preceding chapter prescribed the course to be\r\nfollowed when the press of other business had prevented some of the\r\nassizes on the agenda from being disposed of on the court day. The\r\nshiremoot lasted for one day only, and to hold an adjourned session of\r\nall the suitors on the morrow would inflict hardship on those whose\r\npresence was required elsewhere. The framers of the charter were met by\r\na dilemma in seeking to combine the rapid dispatch of business with the\r\nminimum of inconvenience to those who came to make the court.\r\n\r\nThe Articles of the Barons had made two definite demands not readily\r\nreconciled; namely that none save jurors and the parties to pending\r\nsuits should be summoned to meet the justices of assize on their\r\nquarterly rounds (article 8); and that assizes should be “shortened”\r\n(article 13), which simply meant that the law’s delays should cease.\r\n\r\nThe terms of Magna Carta, as befitted a carefully-drawn, business-like\r\ndocument, were more precise. They made it clear that assizes in the\r\nnormal case should be held in the county court—a point upon which the\r\nArticles had been silent. This was a salutary provision, since a healthy\r\npublicity accompanied the proceedings of the full shire-moot. Nothing\r\nwas said of “shortening” the procedure; and the Charter showed its\r\nappreciation of the fact that there might be more business than could be\r\ngot through in one day. If that happened, a compromise must be made\r\nbetween the claims of litigants wishing their pleas hastened and the\r\ndesire of other people to be discharged from further attendance. The\r\njustices were directed to complete their labours on the morrow, but were\r\nforbidden to retain anyone in attendance except the actual parties to\r\nsuits and a sufficient number of jurors. Those whom Magna Carta thus\r\ncompelled to wait a second day were exactly those whose presence the\r\nArticles had stipulated for upon the first day—not admitting, indeed,\r\nthe possibility that a second day might be required. The discrepancy\r\nbetween the schemes of the two documents might be explained on the\r\nsupposition that the device of timing the visit of the justices with the\r\ndate of holding the monthly shiremoot was only thought of after the\r\nArticles of the Barons had been sealed.[578]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 578:\r\n\r\n  Subsequent practice did not conform to this rule. One _novel\r\n  disseisin_, or one _mort d’ancestor_ might be held by itself; and\r\n  complaint was made in 1258 that the sheriffs proclaimed in the market\r\n  places that all knights and freeholders must assemble for such an\r\n  inquest, and when they came not, amerced them at will (_pro voluntate\r\n  sua_). See Petition of Barons, c. 19 (Sel. Charters, 385).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Charter of 1217 made a different provision for the same contingency.\r\nUnfinished assizes need no longer be taken in their own county on the\r\nday following the county court, nor, indeed, on any other day. The\r\njudges received full authority to bring them to a conclusion elsewhere\r\non their circuit according as it might suit their convenience. This\r\nconcession to the justices, taken in connection with the further\r\nprovisions of 1217, reserving all darrein presentments, together with\r\nother assizes of any difficulty, for the decision of the bench, shows a\r\ncomparative disregard of the convenience of jurors, who might, in the\r\noption of the justices, find themselves compelled either to follow the\r\nassizes from shire to shire, or else to undertake the irksome journey to\r\nWestminster, from which the Charter of 1215 had relieved them.[579]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 579:\r\n\r\n  Subsequent legislation vacillated between two policies, actuated at\r\n  times by a desire to restrain the discretionary powers of the\r\n  justices; and at others by experience of the way in which strict\r\n  adherence to inflexible rules was found to inflict hardships upon\r\n  litigants. The Statute of Westminster II. (13 Edward I. c. 30)\r\n  confirmed the power of the justices to reserve cases of mort\r\n  d’ancestor for decision by the bench, and _per contra_ allowed assizes\r\n  of darrein presentment (which it associated in this connection with\r\n  inquests _quare impedit_) to be taken “in their own counties.” The Act\r\n  6 Richard II. c. 5 curtailed the discretionary powers previously\r\n  conferred, directing that justices assigned to take assizes and to\r\n  deliver gaols should hold sessions in the county towns in which the\r\n  shire courts were wont to be held. The Statute 11 Richard II. c. 11\r\n  once more relaxed this rule, alleging that it had resulted in the\r\n  inconvenience of suitors. Therefore authority was given to the\r\n  chancellor, with the advice of the justices, to determine in what\r\n  places assizes might be held, notwithstanding the provisions of the\r\n  Statute of five years previous.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER TWENTY.\r\n\r\nLiber homo non amercietur pro parvo delicto, nisi secundum modum\r\ndelicti; et pro magno delicto amercietur secundum magnitudinem delicti,\r\nsalvo contenemento suo; et mercator eodem modo, salva mercandisa sua; et\r\nvillanus eodem modo amercietur salvo waynagio suo, si inciderint in\r\nmisericordiam nostram; et nulla predictarum misericordiarum ponatur,\r\nnisi per sacramentum proborum hominum de visneto.\r\n\r\n  A freeman shall not be amerced for a small offence, except in\r\n  accordance with the degree of the offence; and for a grave offence he\r\n  shall be amerced in accordance with the gravity of his offence, yet\r\n  saving always his “contenement”; and a merchant in the same way,\r\n  saving his wares; and a villein shall be amerced in the same way,\r\n  saving his wainage—if they have fallen into our mercy: and none of the\r\n  aforesaid amercements shall be imposed except by the oath of honest\r\n  men of the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the first of three consecutive chapters which seek to remedy\r\ngrave abuses connected with royal amercements. To understand fully what\r\nthese were requires some knowledge, not only of the system of legal\r\nprocedure of which they formed part, but also of previous systems.\r\n\r\nI. _Three stages of criminal law._ The efforts made in medieval England\r\nto devise machinery for suppressing crime took various forms. Three\r\nperiods may be distinguished.\r\n\r\n(1) _The bloodfeud._ The earliest method of redressing wrongs of which\r\nany evidence survives was the practice of retaliation, or the bloodfeud.\r\nThe injured man, or his heir if he were dead, took the law into his own\r\nhands and exacted satisfaction by the aid of battle-axe or spear. This\r\nright of vengeance, formerly clothed with the entire sanction of the\r\nlaw, had practically disappeared before the dawn of authentic history in\r\nEngland; but its previous existence may be confidently inferred from\r\ncertain traces which it left on the laws of a later period.\r\n\r\n(2) _Fixed money-payments._ At some early, but uncertain, date it had\r\nbecome customary to accept money in lieu of vengeance. The new practice,\r\nat first exceptional, and applied to cases only of accidental injury,\r\nwas gradually extended to all cases in which the wronged individual was\r\nwilling to accept a compromise. It was made compulsory on evil-doers to\r\noffer solatium in money for every crime committed, and finally it was\r\nmade compulsory also upon the injured man to accept it when offered. At\r\nthis stage the right of private revenge had become almost a thing of the\r\npast. It was lawful only after the aggrieved individual had demanded,\r\nand been refused, compensation at the recognized rate.\r\n\r\nVarious codes formulated intricate rules for determining the amounts\r\nthus payable. Each man had his own money value or _wer_ (from the simple\r\nfreeman, reckoned at 200 shillings, up to the prelates and lay nobles,\r\nestimated at much higher figures). These were the legal values at which\r\neach man’s life was appraised. Smaller wrongs could be compensated by\r\nsmaller sums in name of damages, known as _bots_: so much for a foot, or\r\nan eye, or a tooth. The king or other feudal lord exacted further\r\npayment from the wrong-doer, under the name of _wites_, which are\r\nsometimes explained as the price charged by the magistrate for enforcing\r\npayment of the _wer_ or _bot_; sometimes as sums due to the community,\r\non the ground that every evil deed inflicts a wrong on society in\r\ngeneral, as well as upon its victim.\r\n\r\n(3) _Amercements._ A third system succeeded. This was of extreme\r\nsimplicity and differed widely in many ways from the complicated system\r\nit superseded. It is found in full working order very shortly after the\r\nNorman Conquest, but was still regarded as an innovation at the\r\naccession of Henry I. It is known as the system of amercements. None of\r\nour authorities contains an entirely satisfactory account of how the\r\nchange took place, but the following suggestions may be hazarded. The\r\nsums demanded from a wrong-doer, who wished to buy himself back into the\r\nprotection of the law, and into the community of well-doers, became\r\nincreasingly burdensome. He had to satisfy the claims of the victim’s\r\nfamily, of the victim’s lord, of the lord within whose territory the\r\ncrime had been committed, of the church, mayhap, whose sanctuary had\r\nbeen invaded, of other lords who could show an interest of any sort, and\r\nfinally of the king as lord paramount. It became practically impossible\r\nto buy back the peace once it had been broken. The Crown, however,\r\nstepped in, and offered protection on certain conditions: the culprit\r\nsurrendered himself and all that he had to the king, placing himself\r\n“_in misericordiam regis_,” and delivering a tangible pledge (_vadium_)\r\nas evidence and security of the surrender.[580]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 580:\r\n\r\n  See Charter of Henry I. c. 8, which however, condemns the whole\r\n  practice among the other innovations of the Conqueror and Rufus.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAlthough in theory the wrongdoer put his property unreservedly at the\r\nking’s disposal, there was a tacit understanding that he should receive\r\nin return, not only a free pardon, but also the restoration of the\r\nbalance of his effects, after the king had helped himself to a share.\r\nSuch a course, at first optional, would gradually come to be followed\r\nwith absolute uniformity. By-and-by, it was assumed that every culprit\r\nwished to avail himself of this means of escape, and thus the words “in\r\nmercy” were written in court records as a matter of course, after the\r\nname of every one convicted of a crime.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand why the Norman kings favoured this system; for\r\nthe Crown thus got whatever it chose to demand, while other claimants\r\ngot nothing. Gradually, then, the old complicated system of _wers_ and\r\n_bots_ and _wites_ became obsolete and was in time forgotten altogether;\r\nthe system of amercements reigned in its stead. Strictly speaking, the\r\nman’s life and limbs and all that he had were at the king’s mercy.[581]\r\nThe Crown, however, found that it might defeat its own interests by\r\nexcessive greed; and generally contented itself with exacting moderate\r\nsums. Soon, rules of procedure were formulated for its own guidance. The\r\namounts taken in each case were regulated partly by the wealth of the\r\noffender, and partly by the gravity of the offence. Further, it became a\r\nrecognized rule that the amount should be assessed by what was\r\npractically a jury of the culprit’s neighbours; and attempts were also\r\nmade to fix a maximum.[582]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 581:\r\n\r\n  See _Dialogus de Scaccario_, II. xvi.\r\n\r\nFootnote 582:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Pollock and Maitland, II. 511-4. There were, however, exceptions,\r\n  _e.g._ Henry II. would not accept money payments for certain forest\r\n  offences. Mutilation was inflicted. See Assize of Woodstock, c. 1, and\r\n  contrast Forest Charter of 1217, c. 10.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThus a sort of tariff grew up, defining the amounts to be exacted for\r\nvarious offences of most general occurrence. The Crown and its officials\r\nusually respected this in practice, but never formally abandoned the\r\nright to demand more. Such payments were known as “amercements” and were\r\nalways technically distinguished from “fines” (or voluntary offerings).\r\nRecords, still extant, of the reign of John show us that for very petty\r\noffences, men were constantly placed “in mercy”; for example, for\r\nfailure to attend meetings of the hundred or county court; for false or\r\nmistaken verdicts; for petty infringements of the king’s forest rights;\r\nand for a thousand other trivial faults. Every man who raised an action\r\nand failed in it was amerced. It will be readily understood how\r\nimportant it was that these amercements, forming so tempting a source of\r\nrevenue to the exchequer, should not be abused. The Charter of Henry I.\r\n(chapter 8) had promised a remedy, drastic indeed but of a reactionary\r\nand impossible nature. He there agreed to abolish altogether the system\r\nof amercements (then of recent introduction) and to revert to the\r\nearlier Anglo-Saxon system of bots and wites, already discussed. This\r\npromise, like others, of Henry I. was made only to be broken.[583]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 583:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Pollock and Maitland (II. 512), who describe Henry’s promise as “a\r\n  return to the old Anglo-Saxon system of pre-appointed wites.” In order\r\n  to avoid unnecessary confusion, no mention has been made in the\r\n  account given above of a classification of amercements into three\r\n  degrees, which increases the obscurity surrounding their origin. The\r\n  _Dialogus de Scaccario_, II. xvi., tells how (_a_) for grave crimes,\r\n  the culprit’s life and limbs were at the king’s mercy as well as his\r\n  property; (_b_) for less important offences, his lands were forfeited,\r\n  but his person was safe; while (_c_) for minor faults, his moveable\r\n  effects only were at the king’s disposal. In the last case, the\r\n  offender was “_in misericordia regis de pecunia sua_.” Thus to be “in\r\n  mercy” did not always mean the same thing. Further, a villein or\r\n  dependent freeman on a manor might fall in the “mercy” of his lord, as\r\n  well as of the king. The records of manorial courts are full of petty\r\n  amercements for petty transgressions of the customs of the manor.\r\n\r\nII. _Magna Carta and Amercements._ All classes had an interest in this\r\nsubject, since no one could expect to pass through life (perhaps hardly\r\nthrough a single year) without being subjected to one or more\r\namercements. Three chapters of Magna Carta accordingly are occupied with\r\nremedies. Chapter 20 seeks to protect the ordinary layman; chapter 21,\r\nthe barons; and chapter 22, the clergy—thus vaguely anticipating the\r\nconception of three estates of the realm;—commons, nobles and clergy.\r\nThe “third estate” is further analysed for the purposes at least of this\r\nclause, into three subdivisions—the freeman, the villein, and the\r\nmerchant.[584]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 584:\r\n\r\n  Even Coke (_Second Institute_, p. 27) has to confess that for the\r\n  purposes of this chapter at least he must abandon the attempt made\r\n  elsewhere (_Ibid._, p. 4, and p. 45) to bring the villeins into the\r\n  class of freemen. Under the plea that the villein was relatively free\r\n  as against third parties except his lord, he claimed for him all the\r\n  benefits secured by anticipation in chapter 1 of the Charter, and he\r\n  made a special application of the same doctrine in connection with the\r\n  right to _judicium parium_ secured to all freemen by chapter 39\r\n  (_q.v._). Here, however, he is forced to admit the distinction between\r\n  freeman and villein, the former term being, for the purpose of\r\n  amercements, virtually identified with “freeholder.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(1) _The amercement of the freeholder._ The great object of the reforms\r\nhere promised was to eliminate the arbitrary element; the Crown must\r\nconform to its own customary rules. With this object, various safeguards\r\nwere devised to regulate the amercing of freemen. (_a_) For a petty\r\noffence, only a petty sum could be taken. This was nothing new: the\r\nrecords of John’s reign show that, both before and after 1215, very\r\nsmall amounts were often taken: three-pence was a common sum. (_b_) For\r\ngrave offences, a larger sum might be assessed, but not out of\r\nproportion to the offence. (_c_) In no case must the offender be pushed\r\nabsolutely to the wall. His means of livelihood must be saved to him.\r\nEven if all other effects of the defaulting freeman had to be sold off\r\nto pay the amount assessed, he was to retain his ancestral freehold (or\r\n“contenement,” a word to be afterwards discussed). He might, however,\r\nfind himself liable for a large sum which he had to pay off by\r\ninstalments during many years. (_d_) Another clause provided machinery\r\nfor giving effect to all these rules. The amount of the amercement must\r\nbe fixed, not arbitrarily by the Crown, but by impartial assessors, “by\r\nthe oath of honest men of the neighbourhood.”\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that all these provisions were declaratory of existing\r\nusage, that is of the usage of John’s reign; but, apparently, a\r\ndifferent procedure and one less favourable to wrong-doers had been in\r\nvogue, so recently as the reign of Henry II. Amercements had then been\r\nassessed, not by local jurors but, by the barons of the exchequer, who\r\nmight, however, where arrears were still due, revise their own findings\r\nof previous years.[585]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 585:\r\n\r\n  See note by editors of _Dialogus de Scaccario_, p. 207.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Pipe Roll of the fourteenth year of Henry II.[586] shows how a\r\ncertain priest, who in this respect stood on precisely the same footing\r\nas a layman, had been placed “_in misericordiam_” of 100 marks by\r\nWilliam fitz John, one of the king’s justices, but how that sum was\r\nafterwards reduced to 40 marks “_per sacramentum vicinorum suorum_.” It\r\nseems a safe inference that, on the priest pleading poverty, the\r\nquestion of his ability to pay was referred to local recognitors with\r\nthe result stated. This priest was subsequently pardoned altogether\r\n“because of his poverty.” His case illustrates how an important change\r\nwas gradually effected. Local jurors first assisted, and then\r\nsuperseded, the barons of exchequer in assessing the amounts payable as\r\namercements. This important boon, which transferred the decision from\r\nunsympathetic Crown officials to the defaulter’s own neighbours, was\r\nconfirmed by Magna Carta to all clergy and to all members of the third\r\nestate. It will be shown, in connection with chapter 21, how earls and\r\nbarons lost a similar privilege.[587]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 586:\r\n\r\n  Madox, I. 527.\r\n\r\nFootnote 587:\r\n\r\n  Reeves, _History of English Law_, I. 248 (Third Edition) says “Upon\r\n  this chapter was afterwards framed the writ _de moderata\r\n  misericordia_, for giving remedy to a party who was excessively\r\n  amerced.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(2) _The amercement of the merchant._ The provisions in favour of\r\nfreeholders were extended to members of the trading classes. One\r\nmodification, however, had to be made. In the normal case, the\r\nmerchant’s means of livelihood were his wares, not his freehold. These\r\nwares, accordingly, were saved to him, not his “contenement” (if he had\r\none). The traders of many favoured towns, however, had already gained\r\nspecial privileges in this as in other matters, and these had received a\r\ngeneral confirmation from chapter 13 of the Great Charter. Some boroughs\r\nhad anticipated Magna Carta by obtaining in their own special charters\r\neither a definition of the maximum amercement exigible, or in some\r\ncases, by a definition of the amercing body. Thus, John’s Charter to\r\nDunwich of 29th June, 1200,[588] provides that the burgesses shall only\r\nbe amerced by six men from within the borough, and six men from without.\r\nThe capital had special privileges: in his Charter to the Londoners,\r\nHenry I. had promised that no citizen _in misericordia pecuniae_ should\r\npay a higher sum than 100s. (the amount of his _wer_).[589] This was\r\nconfirmed in the Charter of Henry II., who declared “that none shall be\r\nadjudged for amercements of money, but according to the law of the city,\r\nwhich they had in the time of King Henry, my grandfather.”[590] John’s\r\nCharter to London of 17th June, 1199, also specially referred to\r\nthis;[591] and the general confirmation of customs contained in chapter\r\n13 of Magna Carta would further strengthen it. In all probability, it\r\ncovered trivial offences only (such as placed the offender in the king’s\r\nhands _de misericordia pecuniae_). The present chapter is wider in its\r\nscope, applying to great offences as well as to small ones, and\r\nembracing merchants everywhere, not merely the burgesses of chartered\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 588:\r\n\r\n  _Rotuli Chartarum_, 51.\r\n\r\nFootnote 589:\r\n\r\n  See _Select Charters_, 108.\r\n\r\nFootnote 590:\r\n\r\n  See Birch, _Historical Charters of London_, p. 5.\r\n\r\nFootnote 591:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, p. 11.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(3) _The amercement of the villein._ The early history of villeins as a\r\nclass is enveloped in the mists which still surround the debateable\r\nquestion of the rise of the English manor. Notwithstanding the brilliant\r\nefforts of Mr. Frederic Seebohm[592] to find the origin of villeinage in\r\nthe status of the serfs who worked for Roman masters upon British farms\r\nor _villae_ long before the Teutonic immigrations began, an older theory\r\nstill holds the field, namely, that the abject villeins of Norman days\r\nwere the descendants of the free-born “ceorls” of Anglo-Saxon times. On\r\nthis theory—the orthodox one, and rightly so, since it is supported by\r\nthe greater weight of evidence—most of England was once cultivated by\r\nfree Anglo-Saxon peasant proprietors originally grouped in little\r\nsocieties each of which formed an isolated village. These free villagers\r\nwere known as “ceorls,” to distinguish them from the gentry or nobility\r\ncalled “eorls,” who enjoyed social consideration but (so it is usually\r\nargued) no unfair political advantages on the score of their noble\r\nblood. The “ceorls” were slowly sinking from their originally free\r\nestate during several centuries prior to 1066: but the process of their\r\ndegradation was completed rapidly and roughly by the harsh measures of\r\nthe Norman conquerors. The bulk of the once free peasantry were crushed\r\ndown into the dependent villeins of the eleventh and twelfth centuries.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 592:\r\n\r\n  See _English Village Community_, _passim_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhichever theory may be the correct one, the position, economic, legal,\r\nand political, of the villeins in the thirteenth century has at the\r\npresent day been ascertained with accuracy and certainty. Economically\r\nthey were reckoned part of the necessary equipment of the manor of their\r\nlord, whose fields they had to cultivate as a condition of being left in\r\npossession of acres which had once been, in a more real sense, their\r\nown. The services to be exacted by the owner of the manor, at first\r\nvague and undefined, were gradually specified and limited. They varied\r\nfrom century to century, from district to district, and even from manor\r\nto manor; but at best the life of the villein was, as a contemporary\r\nwriter has described it, burdensome and wretched (_graviter et\r\nmiserabiliter_). After his manifold obligations were discharged, little\r\ntime was left him for the ploughing and reaping of his own small\r\nholding. The normal villein possessed his portion of land, of a virgate\r\nor half virgate in extent (thirty or fifteen scattered acres) under a\r\ntenure known as _villenagium_, sharply distinguished from the\r\nfreeholder’s tenures, whether of chivalry, serjeanty, or socage. He was\r\na dependent dweller on a manor which he dared not quit without his\r\nmaster’s leave. It is true that he had certain rights of a proprietary\r\nnature in the acres he claimed as his own; yet these were determined,\r\nnot by the common law of England, but by “the custom of the manor,” or\r\nvirtually at the will of the lord. These rights, such as they were,\r\ncould not be pled elsewhere than before the court customary of that\r\nmanor over which the lord’s steward presided with powers wide and\r\nundefined. Legally speaking, the villein was a tenant-at-will whom the\r\nlord could eject without the interference of any higher tribunal than\r\nhis own. Politically, however, the position of the villein was peculiar.\r\nWhile allowed to enjoy none of the privileges, he was yet expected to\r\nperform some of the duties, of the freeman. He attended at the shire and\r\nhundred courts, acted on juries, and performed other public functions,\r\nthus suffering still further encroachments on the scanty portion of time\r\nwhich he might call his own, but preserving for a brighter day some\r\nvague tradition of his earlier liberty. The fact that such public duties\r\nwere performed by the villein, lends strong support to those who argue\r\nin favour of his descent from the old “ceorl” who enjoyed all the\r\nrights, as well as performed all the obligations, of the free. Such\r\nduties would never have been required from a race of hereditary slaves;\r\nbut it is easy to understand how men originally free might be gradually\r\nrobbed of their legal rights, while left to perform legal duties of a\r\nkind so useful to society and to their masters.\r\n\r\nThe words of this chapter of Magna Carta undoubtedly extend some measure\r\nof protection to villeins. Two questions, however, may be asked:—What\r\nmeasure, and from what motive? Answers are called for, because of the\r\nimportance attached to this clause by writers who claim for Magna Carta\r\na popular or democratic basis. One thing is clear: the villeins were\r\nprotected from the abuse of only such amercements as John himself might\r\ninflict, not from the amercements of their manorial lords; for the words\r\nused are “_si inciderint in misericordiam nostram_.” A villein in the\r\nking’s mercy shall enjoy the same consideration as the freeholder or the\r\nmerchant enjoys in similar plight—his “wainage,” that is his plough with\r\nits accoutrements, including possibly the oxen, being saved to him. What\r\nis the motive of these restrictions? It is usually supposed to have been\r\nclemency, the humane desire not to reduce the poor wretch to absolute\r\nbeggary. It is possible, however, to imagine an entirely different\r\nmotive; the villein was the property of his lord, and the king must\r\nrespect the vested interests of others. That he might do what he pleased\r\nwith his own property, his demesne villeins, seems clear from a passage\r\nusually neglected by commentators, namely, chapter 16 of the reissue of\r\n1217. Four important words limiting the restraints on the king’s power\r\nare there introduced—_villanus alterius quam noster_. The king was not\r\nto inflict absolutely crushing amercements on any villeins “_other than\r\nhis own_,” thus leaving the villeins on ancient demesne unreservedly in\r\nhis power.[593]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 593:\r\n\r\n  Thomson, _Magna Charta_, p. 202, seems completely to have\r\n  misunderstood this 16th chapter of the reissue of 1217, construing the\r\n  four interpolated words in a sense the Latin will not bear, viz.:—“A\r\n  villein, _although he belonged to another_.” The view here taken of\r\n  the motive for protecting villeins is strengthened by the use of the\r\n  peculiar phrase, “_vastum hominum_” in chapter 4 (_q.v._).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought, however, that the position of the king’s\r\nvilleins—“tenants on ancient demesne,” as they were technically\r\ncalled—was worse than that of the villeins of an ordinary unroyal manor.\r\nOn the contrary, it has been clearly shown[594] that the king’s peasants\r\nenjoyed privileges denied to the peasants of other lords. Magna\r\nCarta—that \"bulwark of the people’s rights\"—thus left the great bulk of\r\nthe rural population of England completely unprotected from the tyranny\r\nof their lords in amercements as in other things. The king must not take\r\nso much from any lord’s villeins as to destroy their usefulness as\r\nmanorial chattels; that was all.[595]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 594:\r\n\r\n  Notably by Professor Vinogradoff in his _Villeinage in England_,\r\n  _passim_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 595:\r\n\r\n  The wide gulf which separated the villein from the freeman in this\r\n  matter of amercements is shown by an entry on the _Pipe Roll_ of 16\r\n  Henry II. (cited Madox, I. 545) _Herbertus Faber debet j marcam pro\r\n  falso clamore quem fecit ut liber cum sit rusticus._ A villein might\r\n  be heavily amerced for merely claiming to be free. It is peculiarly\r\n  difficult to reconcile any theory of the villein’s freedom with the\r\n  doctrine of Glanvill, V. c. 5, who denies to everyone who had been\r\n  once a villein the right to “wage his law,” even after emancipation,\r\n  where any third party’s interests might thereby be prejudiced.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(4) _The difference between fines and amercements._ In the thirteenth\r\ncentury these terms were sharply contrasted. “Amercement” was applied to\r\nsuch sums only as were imposed in punishment of misdeeds, the\r\nlaw-breaker amending his fault in this way. He had no option of\r\nrefusing, and no voice in fixing the amount assessed upon him. “Fine,”\r\non the contrary, was used for voluntary offerings made to the king with\r\nthe object of procuring some concession in return—to obtain some favour\r\nor to escape some punishment previously decreed. Here the initiative\r\nrested with the individual, who suggested the amount to be paid, and\r\nwas, indeed, under no legal obligation to make any offer at all. This\r\ndistinction between fines and amercements, absolute as it was in theory,\r\ncould readily be obliterated in practice. The spirit of the restriction\r\nplaced by this chapter and by the common law upon the king’s prerogative\r\nof inflicting amercements could usually be evaded by calling the sums\r\nexacted “fines.” For example, the Crown might imprison its victims for\r\nan indefinite period, and then graciously allow them to offer large\r\npayments to escape death by fever or starvation in a noisome gaol. The\r\nletter of Magna Carta was in this way strictly observed, since the\r\nprisoner was nominally as free to abstain entirely from offering as was\r\nthe king to reject all offers until the figure was sufficient to tempt\r\nhis greed. Enormous _fines_ might thus be taken; while royal officials\r\nwere strictly forbidden to inflict arbitrary _amercements_.\r\n\r\nWith the gradual elimination of the voluntary element the word “fine”\r\ncame to bear its modern meaning, while “amercement” dropped out of\r\nordinary use.[596]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 596:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _infra_, c. 55, which supplements this chapter, providing for the\r\n  cancellation of all amercements unjustly inflicted in the past,\r\n  whereas this chapter seeks to prevent the infliction of new ones in\r\n  the future.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(5) _Contenement._ This word, which occurs in Glanvill[597] and in\r\nBracton,[598] and also (in its French form) in the Statute of\r\nWestminster, I.,[599] as well as in Magna Carta, has formed a text for\r\nmany laboured and unsatisfactory explanations from the days of Sir\r\nEdward Coke[600] to our own.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 597:\r\n\r\n  IX. 8.\r\n\r\nFootnote 598:\r\n\r\n  III. folio 116 b.\r\n\r\nFootnote 599:\r\n\r\n  3 Edward I. c. 6.\r\n\r\nFootnote 600:\r\n\r\n  _Second Institute_, p. 27.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no real obscurity, however, since it is clearly a\r\ncompound of \"tenement\"—a word well known as an exact technical term of\r\nfeudal conveyancing—and the prefix “con.” A “tenement” is precisely what\r\na freeman might be expected to have, namely, a freehold estate of his\r\nown. The “con” merely intensifies the meaning, emphasizing the closeness\r\nof the connection between the freeman and his land. Any other tenements\r\nhe had might be taken away, without inflicting extreme hardship; but to\r\ntake from him his \"contenement\"—his ancestral lands—would leave him poor\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nThe word occurs, not only in Glanvill and Bracton, but also in several\r\nentries on the Exchequer Rolls of Henry III. and Edward I., collected by\r\nMadox,[601] and by him collated with other entries which throw light on\r\nthe way in which a “contenement” might be saved to the man amerced. Thus\r\nin 40 Henry III. the officials of the exchequer, after discussing the\r\ncase of an offender who had failed to pay an amercement of 40 marks,\r\nordered inquiry to be made, “how much he was able to pay the king _per\r\nannum_, saving his own sustenance and that of his wife and children,” an\r\nexcerpt which illustrates also the more humane side of exchequer\r\nprocedure. In 14 Edward I. again, the officials of that day, when\r\nferreting out arrears, found that certain poor men of the village of\r\nDoddington had not paid their amercements in full. An inquiry was set on\r\nfoot, and the barons of exchequer were ordered to fix the dates at which\r\nthe various debtors should discharge their debts (evidently an\r\narrangement for payment by instalments) “_salvo contenemento suo_.”[602]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 601:\r\n\r\n  See II. 208-9.\r\n\r\nFootnote 602:\r\n\r\n  See Madox, _Ibid._\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThese illustrations of the actual procedure of later reigns, in agreeing\r\nso closely with the rules laid down by the Great Charter, show how a\r\nman’s contenement might be saved to him without any loss to the Crown.\r\nMagna Carta apparently desires that time should be granted in which to\r\npay up debts by degrees. Meanwhile, the amerced man was not forced to\r\nsell such holding (or wares, or wainage) as was necessary to maintain\r\nhim with his wife and family. Leniency, in the long run, might prove\r\nbest for all concerned, the Crown included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE.\r\n\r\nComites et barones non amercientur nisi per pares suos, et non nisi\r\nsecundum modum delicti.\r\n\r\n  Earls and barons shall not be amerced except through their peers, and\r\n  only in accordance with the degree of the offence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The amercement of earls and barons._ The _barones majores_, as matter\r\nof course, intended to secure for themselves privileges at least equal\r\nwith those of the ordinary freeholder. In assessing their amercements,\r\nboth the gravity of the offence and their ability to pay (as measured by\r\ntheir property) would naturally be considered. Magna Carta mentions only\r\nthe former criterion—it was, indeed, unnecessary to call the king’s\r\nattention to the fact that more could be taken from their wealth than\r\nfrom the ordinary freeholder’s comparative poverty. The saving of a\r\n“contenement” to them would also naturally be assumed. One vital\r\ndifference, however, was distinctly stated. The amercing body was not to\r\nbe a jury of good men of the locality; but a jury of their “peers.”[603]\r\nThe barons here asked only what was their undoubted right—to have the\r\namount of their forfeits determined neither by their feudal inferiors\r\n(freeholders of their own or of other mesne lords) nor yet by Crown\r\nofficials, but by magnates of their own position and with interests in\r\ncommon. This was not an innovation. Mr. Pike[604] has shown how, in\r\nRichard’s reign, barons were not amerced with the common herd: at an\r\neyre held at Hertford in 1198-9, a list of those amerced was drawn up\r\nand definite sums were entered after each name, with two exceptions,\r\nGerald de Furnivall and Reginald de Argenton, each of whom was reserved\r\nfor special treatment “as a baron.” A local jury had evidently on the\r\nspot assessed the amercements of villeins and ordinary freeholders (in\r\nexact accordance with the rules of chapter 20); but the following entry\r\nwas made opposite each of the two barons’ names “to be amerced _at the\r\nExchequer_ for a disseisin.” The Pipe Roll of John’s first year shows\r\nthat this was subsequently done.[605]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 603:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _infra_, under c. 39.\r\n\r\nFootnote 604:\r\n\r\n  _House of Lords_, 255.\r\n\r\nFootnote 605:\r\n\r\n  Cited by Pike, _Ibid._\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMagna Carta, then, had good precedents for insisting that barons ought\r\nnot to be amerced by the justices of eyre in the course of their\r\ncircuits; but what exactly did it mean by demanding amercement \"by their\r\npeers\"? Did this merely mean that a few peers, a few Crown tenants,\r\nshould be present at the exchequer when they were amerced; or was it a\r\ndemand for the assembling, for that purpose, of a full _commune\r\nconcilium_ like that defined in chapter 14?\r\n\r\nThe Crown, in the following reign, placed its own interpretation on\r\nthese words, and succeeded in turning into a special disadvantage what\r\nthe barons had insisted on as a privilege. Bracton[606] repeats this\r\nchapter verbatim, but adds what seems to be an official gloss,\r\nqualifying it by these words: “_et hoc per barones de scaccario vel\r\ncoram ipso rege_.” Barons, under this interpretation of Magna Carta, had\r\ntheir amercements assessed neither by the whole body of “their peers” in\r\na full council, nor yet by a select jury of those peers empannelled in\r\nthe exchequer for that purpose, but by royal officials, the barons of\r\nexchequer, or the justices of King’s Bench. Thus the words of the\r\nCharter were perverted by the ingenuity of the Crown lawyers to\r\nauthorize precisely what they had been originally intended to\r\nforbid.[607]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 606:\r\n\r\n  III., folio 116 b.\r\n\r\nFootnote 607:\r\n\r\n  Pike, _House of Lords_, 256–7, shows how barons were assessed\r\n  sometimes—(_a_) before the barons of exchequer; or (_b_) before the\r\n  full King’s Council; or (_c_) at a later date, even before the\r\n  justices of Common Pleas. They were never assessed, however, before\r\n  the justices on circuit. Is it possible that one reason why the name\r\n  _Barones Scaccarii_ was retained as the official title of the four\r\n  justices who presided over the Court of Exchequer was the Crown’s wish\r\n  to preserve the fiction that these official “_barones_” were really\r\n  peers of the holders of \"baronies\"?\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth century several cases are recorded, in the course of\r\nwhich defaulters, in the hope of escaping with smaller payments,\r\nprotested against being reckoned as barons. For example, a certain\r\nThomas de Furnivall in the nineteenth year of Edward II. complained that\r\nhe had been amerced as a baron “to his great damage, and against the law\r\nand custom of the realm,” whereas he really held nothing by barony. The\r\nking directed the Treasurer and Barons of the Exchequer “that if it\r\nappeared to them that Thomas was not a baron, nor did hold his land by\r\nbarony, then they should discharge him of the said imposed amercement;\r\nprovided that Thomas should be amerced according to the tenor of the\r\ngreat Charter of Liberties,”[608] that is to say, as a simple freeholder\r\naccording to the provisions of chapter 20. It is clear that Thomas de\r\nFurnivall was confident that a local jury would amerce him at a lower\r\nfigure than that fixed by the exchequer barons. A few years earlier the\r\nAbbot of Croyland had made a similar plea, but without success.[609]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 608:\r\n\r\n  Madox, I. 535-8.\r\n\r\nFootnote 609:\r\n\r\n  See Madox, _Ibid._, and also Pike, _House of Lords_, 257.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAt a later date barons and earls were successful in securing by another\r\nexpedient some measure of immunity from excessive exactions. They had\r\nestablished, prior to the first year of Henry VI., a recognized scale of\r\namercements with which the Crown was expected, in ordinary\r\ncircumstances, to content itself.[610] In the reign of Edward IV. a duke\r\nwas normally amerced at £10, and an earl or a bishop at 100s.[611]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 610:\r\n\r\n  See Pike, _Ibid._\r\n\r\nFootnote 611:\r\n\r\n  Madox, _Baronia Anglica_, 106, seems to view these sums as fixing a\r\n  minimum, not a maximum. “If a baron was to be amerced for a small\r\n  trespass, his amercement was wont to be 100s. at the least; he might\r\n  be amerced at more, not at less. This, I think, was the meaning of the\r\n  term _amerciater ut baro_.” He adds that a commoner for a similar\r\n  trespass would get off with 10s., 20s., or 40s.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO.\r\n\r\nNullus clericus amercietur de laico tenemento suo, nisi secundum modum\r\naliorum predictorum, et non secundum quantitatem beneficii sui\r\necclesiastici.\r\n\r\n  A clerk shall not be amerced in respect of his lay holding except\r\n  after the manner of the others aforesaid; further, he shall not be\r\n  amerced in accordance with the extent of his church benefice.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amercement of the clergy._ The churchman was to receive the same\r\nfavourable treatment as the layman in all respects, and to enjoy one\r\nadditional privilege. In proportioning the amercement to the extent of\r\nhis wealth, no account was to be taken of the value of his “church\r\nbenefice.” A sharp distinction is here drawn between _laicum tenementum_\r\n(or, as the 10th of the Articles of the Barons expressed it, _laicum\r\nfeodum_) and _beneficium ecclesiasticum_. This antithesis between “lay\r\nfee” and \"alms\"—that is, between lands held by barony, knight’s service,\r\nor any other secular tenure on the one hand, and lands held by\r\nfrankalmoin on the other—was a familiar one in the Middle Ages.[612]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 612:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_ 66-70 and cf. Constitutions of Clarendon (c. 9), which\r\n  distinguish _tenementum pertinens ad eleemosinam_ from _ad laicum\r\n  feudum_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOnly the former was to be reckoned in fixing the defaulting clerk’s\r\namercement. This would leave the bishop or abbot exposed to a higher\r\npayment proportionate to his barony, while exempting the parish priest\r\nfrom any assessment on account of his rectory and glebe. It would almost\r\nseem that in the normal case the incumbent with no wealth but the\r\nproduce and rents of his benefice would thus escape from amercement\r\naltogether; yet, if he had no lay tenement, he might still have\r\nchattels, or might at least pay instalments from the annual increase of\r\nhis crops. This exemption in favour of those who held lands in “alms”\r\nmay have proceeded from several possible motives. Frankalmoin enjoyed\r\nmany privileges, including, in the reign of Henry II., complete immunity\r\nfrom the jurisdiction of all secular courts.[613] Perhaps the Exchequer\r\ndid not dare to levy contributions upon such lands. In any view, it\r\nwould have been manifestly unjust to treat the clerical incumbent as\r\nthough he were the owner in fee simple of the church’s patrimony.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 613:\r\n\r\n  See Constitutions of Clarendon, _Ibid._ The Crown soon withdrew this\r\n  immunity.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe word “clerk” was a wide one, including not only the ordinary parish\r\npriests (whether rectors or vicars) with the deacons and those who had\r\ntaken minor orders, but also the monks and canons regular (whose vows of\r\npoverty, however, left no loophole for the legal retention by them of\r\nprivate property which could require protection). It included also the\r\nhigher clergy, great prelates, bishops and abbots, whose status was,\r\nhowever, complicated by their ownership of Crown lands. Their character\r\nof “baron” was often more prominent in constitutional questions than\r\nthat of “clerk in holy orders.” Their treatment in the matter of\r\namercements is a case in point.[614] There could have been no doubt from\r\nthe first that a bishop “in mercy” must submit to have his barony taken\r\ninto consideration in fixing his amercement. It would almost seem that\r\nthe great prelates were not intended to benefit in any way from this\r\nexemption. Such is the suggestion conveyed by a slight alteration\r\neffected in the Charter of 1217, which substitutes for the wider\r\n“_clericus_” of the text the more restricted expression \"_ecclesiastica\r\npersona_\"—words which in the thirteenth century denoted the parish\r\nclergy, and were used much as is the word “parson” in colloquial speech\r\nat the present day.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 614:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Pike, _House of Lords_, 254.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nA certain looseness in the arrangement of the Latin words of this\r\nchapter, as it originally stood in 1215, seems to have suggested the\r\nneed for improvement. Alterations, apparently of a verbal nature, were\r\nmade with some evidences of care in Henry’s reissues. The “_de laico\r\ntenemento_” of 1215 was omitted altogether in 1216; but a reference to\r\nthe “lay fees” of the clergy was reintroduced in 1217, subject to a\r\ncomplete reconstruction of the sentence to make it read smoothly, and so\r\navoid the possibility of misconception.[615]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 615:\r\n\r\n  In its final form it reads: “_Nulla ecclesiastica persona amercietur\r\n  secundum quantitatem beneficii sui ecclesiastici, sed secundum\r\n  tenementum suum et secundum quantitatem delicti._” Dr. Stubbs, _Sel.\r\n  Charters_ 345, by a curious oversight, reads for “_tenementum_” the\r\n  compound “_contenementum_,” for which there seems to be no authority.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE.\r\n\r\nNec villa nec homo distringatur facere pontes ad riparias, nisi qui ab\r\nantiquo et de jure facere debent.\r\n\r\n  No community or individual[616] shall be compelled to make bridges at\r\n  river banks, except those who from of old were legally bound to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of this chapter is obvious; to compel the king to desist\r\nfrom his practice of illegally increasing the extent of an\r\nobligation—admitted as perfectly legal within the limits defined by\r\nancient usage—the obligation to keep in good repair all existing\r\nbridges over rivers. John might continue to exact what his ancestors\r\nhad exacted; but nothing more. So much lies on the surface of the\r\nCharter, which explains, however, neither the origin of the obligation\r\nnor the reasons which made John keen to enforce it.\r\n\r\nI. _Origin of the Obligation to make Bridges._ The Norman kings seem to\r\nhave based their claim to compel their subjects to maintain such bridges\r\nas were necessary, upon an ancient threefold obligation,[616] (known as\r\nthe _trinoda necessitas_) incumbent on all freemen during the\r\nAnglo-Saxon period. Three duties were[617] required of all the men of\r\nEngland in the interests of the commonweal: attendance on the fyrd or\r\nlocal militia; the making of roads, so necessary for military purposes;\r\nand the repairing of bridges and fortifications. Gradually, as feudal\r\ntendencies prevailed, the obligation to construct bridges ceased to be a\r\npersonal burden upon all freemen, and became a territorial burden\r\nattached to certain manors or freeholders. In other words, it was made a\r\npart of the services incidental to the feudal tenure of particular\r\nestates. The present chapter, in forbidding the illegal extension of\r\nthis burden to communities or individuals other than those who rendered\r\nit as part of the services due for their lands, seems to be only a\r\nparticular application of the general principle enunciated in chapter\r\n16. The evil complained of, however, required special treatment because\r\nof the prominence into which it had been forced by John, who had abused\r\npowers vested in his ancestors for national purposes, in order to\r\nfurther his own selfish pleasures, in a manner so well known to his\r\ncontemporaries as not to require specification in Magna Carta.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 616:\r\n\r\n  The word “_villa_,” used at first as synonymous with “manor,” came to\r\n  be freely applied not only to all villages, but also to chartered\r\n  towns. Even London was described as a _villa_ in formal writs.\r\n  “_Homo_,” though often loosely used, was the word naturally applied to\r\n  a feudal tenant. The version given by Coke (_Second Institute_, p. 30)\r\n  reads “_liber homo_,” which is also the reading of one MS. of the\r\n  _Inspeximus_ of 1297 (25 Edward I.). See _Statutes of the Realm_, I.\r\n  114.\r\n\r\nFootnote 617:\r\n\r\n  See _Rot. Claus._, 19 Henry III., cited by Moore, _History and Law of\r\n  Fisheries_, p. 8.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nII. _The King’s interest in the Repair of Bridges._ John’s motives for\r\nmaking an oppressive use of this prerogative must be sought in a\r\nsomewhat unexpected quarter, in the king’s rights of falconry, and in\r\nhis frequent need for ready means of crossing rivers in pursuit of his\r\nvaluable birds of prey. Whenever John proposed to ride a-fowling, with\r\nhis hawk upon his wrist, he issued letters compelling the whole\r\ncountry-side to bestir themselves in the repair of bridges in every\r\ndistrict which his capricious pleasure might lead him to visit. Several\r\nsuch writs of the reign of Henry III. are still extant. The exact words\r\nof these vary somewhat, but a comparison of their terms leaves no room\r\nfor doubt either as to the nature of the commands they conveyed or the\r\nreasons for issuing them. Addressed to the sheriffs of such counties as\r\nthe king was likely to visit, at a convenient interval beforehand, these\r\nletters gave instructions that all necessary steps should be taken in\r\npreparation for the king’s hawking. The writs contained two commands, an\r\norder for the repair of bridges, and a prohibition against the taking of\r\nbirds before the king had enjoyed his sport. Both points are well\r\nbrought out in a Letter Close of Henry III., dated 26th December, 1234,\r\nwhich directed \"all bridges on the rivers Avon, Test, and Itchen to be\r\nrepaired as was wont in the time of King John, so that when the lord\r\nKing may come to these parts, free transit shall lie open to him for\r\n“riviating” (_ad riviandum_) upon the said rivers.\" The writ then\r\nproceeded to command the sheriff to issue a general prohibition against\r\nany one attempting “to riviate” along the river banks, previous to the\r\ncoming of the king (“_ne aliquis riviare praesumat per riparias illas\r\nantequam rex illic venerit_”).[618]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 618:\r\n\r\n  See _Rot. Claus._ 19 Henry III., cited in Moore, _History and Law of\r\n  Fisheries_, p. 8.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Latin verb, for which “to riviate” has been coined as an English\r\nequivalent, has long been the subject of misconception; but conclusive\r\nevidence has recently been adduced to prove that it referred to the\r\nmedieval sport of fowling, that is to the taking of wild birds in sport\r\nby means of hawks and falcons.[619]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 619:\r\n\r\n  See Moore, _Ibid._, 8–16. Two links in the chain of evidence are\r\n  worthy of emphasis:—(_a_) Writs of 13th November and 1st December,\r\n  1234, order repair of bridges for the transit of the king “along with\r\n  his birds” (_cum avibus suis_). (_b_) A writ of 28th October, 1283,\r\n  gives _aves capere_ as the equivalent of _riviare_. This writ contains\r\n  a licence to the Earl of Hereford “during the present winter season to\r\n  _riviate_ and to take river-fowl of this nature (_riviare et aves\r\n  ripariarum hujusmodi capere_) throughout the rivers Lowe and Frome\r\n  which are in defence (_in defenso_).”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThese writs prove that the Crown claimed and exercised a monopoly of, or\r\nat least a preferential right to, this form of sport along the banks of\r\ncertain rivers; and these “preserved” rivers were accordingly said to be\r\nplaced “in defence” (_in defenso_), a phrase which occurs in many of the\r\nwrits referred to, as well as in a later chapter of Magna Carta.[620]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 620:\r\n\r\n  _I.e._ c. 47 (_q.v._). Any district or object over which the king or a\r\n  private individual had sole rights of any kind to the exclusion of the\r\n  public might apparently be said to be placed _in defenso_ in regard to\r\n  the object of such rights. In this case, the word “riviation” makes\r\n  the object plain.\r\n\r\nTwo distinct hardships were thus imposed on the nation by the king’s\r\nexercise of his rights of falconry, one negative and the other positive.\r\nIn the interval between the king’s intimation and his arrival at the\r\nindicated rivers, the sport of all other people was interfered with,\r\nwhile the obligation to reconstruct otherwise useless bridges was a more\r\nmaterial burden on every village and individual exposed to it. A wise\r\nking would be careful to use such rights so as to inflict on his\r\nsubjects a minimum of hardship. John, however, knew no moderation,\r\nplacing “in defence” not merely a few banks at a time, but many rivers\r\nindiscriminately, including those which had never been so treated in his\r\nfather’s day, and demanding that all bridges everywhere should be\r\nrepaired, with the object, not so much of indulging a genuine love of\r\nsport, as of inflicting heavy amercements on those who neglected prompt\r\nobedience to his commands. Great consternation was aroused by John’s\r\naction at Bristol in 1209 when he prohibited the taking of birds\r\nthroughout the entire realm of England.[621]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 621:\r\n\r\n  R. Wendover, II. 49 (R.S.), “_Ibi capturam avium per totam Angliam\r\n  interdixit._”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBoth of these grievances, thus augmented by the policy of King John,\r\nwere redressed by Magna Carta, though in different clauses. In the\r\npresent chapter John promised not to impose the burden of repairing\r\nbridges on those from whom it was not legally due.[622] Chapter 47, in\r\nwhich he agreed to withdraw his interdict from all rivers which he had\r\nplaced “in defence” during his own reign, and also to disafforest all\r\nforests of his own creation, was entirely omitted in the Charter of\r\n1216;[623] but in 1217 it reappeared in a new position and expressed in\r\ndifferent words. The provision of the original chapter 47, relating to\r\nforests, was relegated to the _Carta de Foresta_, then granted for the\r\nfirst time, and the other part of that chapter, relating to falconry,\r\nwas naturally enough joined to a clause which redressed another\r\ngrievance growing from the same root. Chapter 19 of Henry III.’s\r\nCharter, in its final form, repeats word for word the terms of the\r\npresent chapter of John, while in chapter 20 Henry proceeds to declare\r\n“that no river shall in future be placed in defence except such as were\r\nin defence in the time of King Henry, our grandfather, throughout the\r\nsame places and during the same periods as they were wont in his day.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 622:\r\n\r\n  Article 11 of the Barons had demanded that no _villa_ should be\r\n  _amerced_ for failure to make such illegal repairs, thus illustrating\r\n  at once John’s policy, and the point of connection between this\r\n  provision and the immediately preceding chapters which dealt with\r\n  amercements.\r\n\r\nFootnote 623:\r\n\r\n  It was, however, included among the subjects reserved for further\r\n  consideration in “the respiting clause” (c. 42 of 1216) under the\r\n  words “_de ripariis et earum custodibus_.” Cf. _supra_, 169.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis express prohibition seems to have prevented the Crown from\r\nextending its prerogatives any further in this direction. Yet Henry III.\r\nhad ample opportunities of harassing his subjects by an inconsiderate\r\nuse of the rights still left to him. By issuing wholesale orders\r\naffecting every preserved river which he had an admitted right to put\r\n“in defence,” he might inflict widespread and wanton hardships. In many\r\ncases dubiety existed on the question of fact as to what banks had\r\nactually been “defended” by Henry II., and a vague general command which\r\nnamed no special rivers left in cruel uncertainty the district to be\r\nvisited. Henry III., accordingly, either yielding to pressure or in\r\nreturn for grants of money, made important concessions. After the year\r\n1241, he invariably specified the particular river along whose banks he\r\nintended to sport, and sometimes even announced the exact date at which\r\nhe expected to arrive. As no writs appear subsequent to 1247, it is\r\npossible that he was induced to abstain altogether from the exercise of\r\na right which inflicted hardships on the people out of all proportion to\r\nthe benefits conferred on the king.[624]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 624:\r\n\r\n  Moore, _Ibid._, 9.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Crown, however, had not renounced its prerogatives, and several\r\nwrits still exist to show that Edward I. occasionally allowed his great\r\nnobles to share in the royal sport. Licences to this effect were granted\r\nin 1283 to the Earl of Hereford and to Reginald fitz Peter, and in the\r\nfollowing year to the Earl of Lincoln. On 6th October, 1373, Edward III.\r\nby his writ commanded the sheriff of Oxfordshire to declare that all\r\nbridges should be repaired and all fords marked out with stakes for the\r\ncrossing of the king “with his falcons” during the approaching winter\r\nseason.[625]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 625:\r\n\r\n  Moore, _Ibid._, 12.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIII. _Erroneous Interpretations._ There is nothing astonishing in the\r\nfact that a pastime so passionately followed as falconry was in the\r\nMiddle Ages, should have left its traces on two chapters of Magna Carta,\r\nthe full import of which has not hitherto been appreciated by\r\ncommentators, partly from failure to bring both of them together, but\r\nchiefly because of the too precipitate assumption that the words _ad\r\nriviandum_ and _in defenso_, occurring in writs and charters, referred\r\nto _fishing_ rather than to fowling.[626]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 626:\r\n\r\n  The _Mirror of Justices_ is cited as first suggesting this. See Moore,\r\n  _Ibid._, 12–16, where the gradual development of the error is traced.\r\n  Coke, _Second Institute_, 30, was misled by the _Mirror_, and he has\r\n  in turn misled others.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt has been confidently inferred that the framers of Magna Carta when\r\nforbidding additional banks to be put “in defence,” equally as when\r\ndemanding the removal of “weirs” from non-tidal waters,[627] were\r\ninfluenced by a desire to preserve public rights of fishing against\r\nencroachment by the king or by private owners. In either case the\r\nmotives were entirely different. In the Middle Ages, fishing was a means\r\nof procuring food, not a form of sport: to depict John and his\r\naction-loving courtiers as exponents of the gentle art of Isaac Walton\r\nis a ridiculous anachronism.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 627:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _infra_, under c. 33.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt is quite true that the value of fish as an article of diet led in\r\ntime to legislation directed primarily to their protection; but\r\napparently no statute with such a motive was passed previous to\r\n1285.[628] It is further true that in the reign of Edward I. it became\r\nusual to describe rivers, over which exclusive rights of fishing had\r\nbeen established by riparian owners, as being _in defenso_;[629] but\r\nrivers might be “preserved” for more purposes than one. From Edward’s\r\nreign onwards, however, rights of fishing steadily became more valuable,\r\nwhile falconry was superseded by other pastimes. Accordingly a new\r\nmeaning was sought for provisions of Magna Carta whose original motive\r\nhad been forgotten. So early as the year 1283 the words of a petition to\r\nthe king in Parliament show that “fishing” had been substituted for\r\n“hawking” in interpreting the prohibition referred to in chapter 47 of\r\nJohn’s Charter. In that year the men of York complained that Earl\r\nRichard had interfered with their rights of fishing by placing _in\r\ndefenso_ the rivers Ouse and Yore, a proceeding they declared to be\r\n“against the tenor of Magna Carta.”[630] This error, the first\r\nappearance of which thus dates from 1283, has been accepted for upwards\r\nof five hundred years by all commentators on Magna Carta. The credit for\r\ndispelling it is due to Mr. Stuart A. Moore and Mr. H. S. Moore in their\r\n_History and Law of Fisheries_, published in 1903.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 628:\r\n\r\n  This was 13 Edward I., stat. 1, c. 47, cited Moore, _Ibid._, 173.\r\n\r\nFootnote 629:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, p. 6.\r\n\r\nFootnote 630:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, p. 16.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR.\r\n\r\nNullus vicecomes, constabularius, coronatores, vel alii ballivi nostri,\r\nteneant placita corone nostre.\r\n\r\n  No sheriff, constable, coroners, or others of our bailiffs, shall hold\r\n  pleas of our Crown.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main object of this provision is beyond doubt: men accused of crimes\r\nmust be tried before the king’s judges and not by local magistrates of\r\nwhatsoever kind. The innocent looked confidently for justice to the\r\nrepresentatives of the central government; while they dreaded the\r\njurisdiction of the less responsible officials resident in the\r\ncounty—local tyrants whose harshness had earned them a hearty and\r\nwidespread hatred. The sheriffs and castellans thoroughly deserved their\r\nbad reputation; for the records of the age overflow with tales of their\r\ncruelties and illegal oppressions. It ought not to be forgotten,\r\nhowever, that if this chapter contains a condemnation of the local\r\nadministration of justice, it testifies, at the same time, to the\r\ncomparative purity of the justice dispensed by the king’s own judges. So\r\nfar there is no difficulty; but some differences of opinion exist as to\r\nthe exact bearing of this provision on certain points of detail.\r\n\r\nI. _Pleas of the Crown._ All litigations tended to be distinguished into\r\ntwo kinds, royal pleas and common pleas, according as the interests of\r\nthe Crown were or were not specially involved. This classification has\r\nalready been discussed in connection with chapter 17, which sought to\r\nregulate the procedure in common pleas. The present chapter concerns\r\nitself only with “pleas of the Crown,” a phrase which had even in 1215\r\nconsiderably altered its original meaning. In the eleventh century it\r\nhad denoted all royal business, whether specially relating to legal\r\nprocedure or not, embracing all matters connected with the king’s\r\nhousehold or his estates, with the collection of his revenue, or the\r\nadministration of his justice, civil as well as criminal. Gradually,\r\nhowever, the usage of the word altered in two respects, contracting in\r\none direction, while expanding in another. It ceased to be applied to\r\nfinancial business and even to non-criminal, judicial business; and it\r\nwas thereafter reserved for criminal trials held before the king’s\r\njudges. This process of contraction had been nearly completed before the\r\naccession of John.\r\n\r\nAnother tendency, however, in an opposite direction had been for some\r\ntime in progress; the distinction drawn in early reigns between petty\r\ntrespasses, which were left in the province of the sheriff, and grave\r\noffences, which alone were worthy of the king’s attention, was being\r\nslowly obliterated.[631] The royal courts steadily extended the sphere\r\nof their activity over all misdeeds, however trivial, until the whole\r\nrealm of criminal law fell under the description of “pleas of the\r\nCrown.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 631:\r\n\r\n  Traces of it may be found as late as the reign of Henry II. See\r\n  Glanvill, I. c. 1.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn the reign of John this process of expansion was far from complete:\r\nthe words then, indeed, embraced grave criminal offences tried in the\r\nking’s courts, but not the numerous petty offences, which were still\r\ndisposed of in the sheriffs tourn or elsewhere.[632]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 632:\r\n\r\n  The gradual triumph of royal justice over all rivals in the sphere of\r\n  criminal law is thus symbolized by the extension of the phrase “pleas\r\n  of the Crown,” which can be traced through a series of\r\n  documents—_e.g._ (_a_) the laws of Cnut; (_b_) Glanvill, I. cc. I, 2,\r\n  and 3; (_c_) the Assizes of Clarendon and Northampton; (_d_) the\r\n  ordinance of 1194; and (_e_) the present chapter of Magna Carta.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNorth of the Tweed the same phrase has had a completely different\r\nhistory: in modern Scots law its connotation is still a narrow one; and\r\nthis is a direct result of the slow growth of the Scottish Crown in\r\nauthority and jurisdiction, in notable contrast to the rapidity with\r\nwhich the English Crown attained the zenith of its power. The kings of\r\nScotland failed to crush their powerful and unruly vassals, and\r\nconsequently the pleas of the Scottish Crown, exclusively reserved for\r\nthe High Court of Justiciary, formed a meagre list—the four heinous\r\ncrimes of murder, robbery, rape, and arson. The feudal courts of the\r\nScottish nobles long preserved their wide jurisdiction over all other\r\noffences. When the heritable jurisdictions were at last abolished, in\r\n1748, mainly as a consequence of the rebellion of three years\r\npreviously, the old distinction, so deeply rooted in Scots law, still\r\nremained. The sheriff court had no cognizance, until late in the\r\nnineteenth century, over the four crimes specially reserved for the\r\nking’s judges.[633] Thus in Scotland the historic phrase “pleas of the\r\nCrown” is, even at the present day, confined to murder, robbery, rape,\r\nand fire-raising, while to an English lawyer it embraces the entire\r\nrealm of criminal law.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 633:\r\n\r\n  The _Criminal Procedure_ (_Scotland_) Act, 1887 (50 and 51 Victoria,\r\n  c. 35) gave him jurisdiction over three of them.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nII. _Keeping and Trying Criminal Pleas._ The machinery for bringing\r\ncriminals to justice, as organized by Henry II., was somewhat elaborate.\r\nFor our present purpose, it may be sufficient to emphasize two important\r\nstages in the procedure. An interval had always to elapse between the\r\ncommission of a grave crime and the formal trial of the criminal, since\r\nit was necessary to wait for the coming of the itinerant justices, which\r\nonly took place at intervals of about seven years. Meanwhile,\r\npreliminary steps must be taken to collect and record evidence of\r\noffences, which might otherwise be lost. The magistrate responsible for\r\nthese preliminary steps was said to “keep” the pleas (_custodire\r\nplacita_)—that is, to watch them or prevent them from passing out of\r\nmind while waiting the coming of the justices who would formally “hold”\r\nor “try” or “determine” the same pleas (_placitare_ or _habere_ or\r\n_tenere placita_).\r\n\r\nBefore the reign of John, not only had the fundamental distinction\r\nbetween these two stages of procedure been clearly grasped, but the two\r\nfunctions had been entrusted to two distinct types of royal officials.\r\nThe local magistrates of each district “kept” royal pleas, while only\r\nthe justices who represented the central government could “hold” them.\r\nThe process of differentiation was accelerated towards the close of the\r\ntwelfth century in consequence of the jealousy with which the Crown\r\nregarded the increasing independence of the sheriffs. The elaborate\r\ninstructions issued in 1194 to the justices whom Archbishop Hubert\r\nWalter was despatching on a more than usually important visitation of\r\nthe counties contain two provisions intended to keep the growing\r\npretensions of the sheriffs within due bounds.[634]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 634:\r\n\r\n  See _Forma procedendi in placitis coronae regis_, cc. 20 and 21, cited\r\n  in _Sel. Charters_, 260.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThey were expressly forbidden to act as justices within their own\r\ncounties, or, indeed, in any counties in which they had acted as\r\nsheriffs at any time since Richard’s coronation.[635]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 635:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, c. 21.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt is safe to infer that the “trying” of royal pleas was the province\r\nfrom which in particular the sheriff was thus excluded. Even with regard\r\nto the “keeping” or preliminary stages of such pleas the sheriff was by\r\nno means left in sole command. The justices received instructions[636]\r\nto cause three knights and one clerk to be chosen in each county as\r\n“_custodes placitorum coronae_.” It is possible that these new local\r\nofficers, specially entrusted with the duty of “keeping” royal pleas,\r\nwere intended rather to co-operate with than to supersede the sheriffs\r\nin this function, but in any view the sheriffs had no longer a monopoly\r\nof authority in their bailiwicks. Magistrates, to be afterwards known as\r\ncoroners, were thenceforward associated with them in the administration\r\nof the county.[637]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 636:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, c. 20.\r\n\r\nFootnote 637:\r\n\r\n  The _Forma procedendi_ of 1194 is usually considered the earliest\r\n  distinct reference to the office of coroner. Dr. Gross, however\r\n  (_History of Office of Coroner_, 1892, and _Select Cases from\r\n  Coroners’ Rolls_, 1896), claims to have found traces of their\r\n  existence at a much earlier date. Prof. Maitland remains unconvinced\r\n  (_Eng. Hist. Rev._, VIII. 758, and Pollock and Maitland, I. 519).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe ordinance of 1194 seems to have settled subsequent practice in both\r\nrespects. Sheriffs, while still free to punish petty offenders on their\r\nown authority, in their half-yearly tourns or circuits, allowed the\r\ncoroners to “keep” royal pleas, and the justices to “try” them.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion of the day strongly approved both rules, yet John\r\ncondoned and encouraged irregularities, allowing sheriffs to meddle with\r\npleas of the Crown, even when the coroners were not present to check\r\ntheir arbitrary methods;[638] and allowing them to give a final judgment\r\non such pleas, involving, mayhap, loss of life or limb to those found\r\nguilty, without waiting the arrival of the Justices.[639] Such\r\ndeviations from the normal course of procedure could be no longer\r\ntolerated. Magna Carta accordingly, in this first of a series of\r\nchapters directed against the misdeeds of sheriffs and other local\r\nmagistrates, forbade them to interfere in this province.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 638:\r\n\r\n  This is the inference to be drawn from the 14th of the Articles of the\r\n  Barons.\r\n\r\nFootnote 639:\r\n\r\n  This is the inference to be drawn from c. 24 of Magna Carta.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIII. _The Intention of Magna Carta._ The barons, in this matter as in so\r\nmany others, were merely demanding that the Crown should observe\r\nstrictly and impartially the rules which it had laid down for its own\r\nguidance: caprice must give way to law. Sheriffs must not, with or\r\nwithout the king’s connivance, usurp the functions of coroners; nor must\r\nsheriffs and coroners together usurp those of the king’s justiciars. The\r\nopposition leaders naturally associated these two irregularities\r\ntogether, and may even have assumed that expressly to abolish the one\r\nimplied, with sufficient clearness, an intention to abolish the other\r\nalso. Such a supposition would explain a peculiar discrepancy between\r\nthe Articles and the Charter, in its final form, which it is otherwise\r\ndifficult to account for. While Article 14 demanded redress of one\r\nspecific grievance, Magna Carta granted redress of an entirely different\r\none. The earlier document, neglecting the distinction between “keeping”\r\nand “trying” pleas, simply requires that coroners (whose comparative\r\npopularity is explained by their appointment in the county court) should\r\nalways be associated with the sheriff when he meddles in any way with\r\npleas of the Crown. The Charter is silent on this subject; but forbids\r\nsheriffs and coroners, whether acting separately or together, to “try”\r\nor finally determine pleas of this description. These two provisions are\r\nthe complements of each other. Magna Carta would thus seem to be here\r\nincomplete.\r\n\r\nThe prohibition against sheriffs trying pleas of the Crown was repeated\r\nin all reissues of the Charter; and, although not perhaps strictly\r\nenforced in Henry’s reign, soon became absolute. Under Edward I. it was\r\ninterpreted to mean that no one could determine such pleas unless armed\r\nwith a royal commission to that effect;[640] and the commission would\r\ntake the form either of gaol delivery, of trailbaston, or of oyer and\r\nterminer.[641]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 640:\r\n\r\n  See Coke, _Second Institute_, 30, and authorities there cited.\r\n\r\nFootnote 641:\r\n\r\n  For explanation of these terms, see _supra_, c. 18.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIV. _An Erroneous View._ Hallam seems to have misunderstood the object\r\naimed at by this provision. Commenting on the corresponding chapter of\r\nHenry’s Charter of 1225, he declares that the “criminal jurisdiction of\r\nthe Sheriff is entirely taken away by Magna Charta, c. 17.”[642] This is\r\na complete mistake: both before and after the granting of the Charter,\r\nthe sheriff exercised criminal jurisdiction, and that of two distinct\r\nkinds. Along with the coroners, he conducted preliminary enquiries even\r\ninto pleas of the Crown; while in his tourn (which was specially\r\nauthorized to be held twice a year by chapter 42 of the very Charter\r\nquoted by Hallam) he was completely responsible for every stage of\r\nprocedure in regard to trivial offences. He heard indictments and then\r\ntried and punished petty offenders in a summary manner.[643] Several\r\nstatutes of later reigns confirmed, even while regulating, the authority\r\nof the sheriff to take indictments at his tourns,[644] until this\r\njurisdiction was transferred, by an act of the fifteenth century, to the\r\njustices of peace assembled in Quarter Sessions.[645]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 642:\r\n\r\n  See _Middle Ages_, II. 482, n.\r\n\r\nFootnote 643:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Stephen, _History of Criminal Law_, I. 83. The mistake made by\r\n  Hallam and others may have been in part the result of their neglecting\r\n  the important modification undergone by the phrase “pleas of the\r\n  Crown” between 1215, when it was still confined to a few specific\r\n  crimes of special gravity, and the present day, when it has become\r\n  synonymous with the whole field of criminal law.\r\n\r\nFootnote 644:\r\n\r\n  _E.g._ 13 Edward I. c. 13, and 1 Edward III., stat. 2, c. 17.\r\n\r\nFootnote 645:\r\n\r\n  1 Edward IV. c. 2.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAll that Magna Carta did was to insist that no sheriff or local\r\nmagistrate should encroach on the province reserved for the royal\r\njustices, namely the final “trying” of such grave crimes as had now come\r\nto be recognized as “pleas of the Crown.”[646] The Charter did not even\r\nattempt to define what these were, leaving the boundary between great\r\nand small offences to be settled by use and wont. In all this, it was\r\nsimply declaratory of existing practice, making no attempt to draw the\r\nline in a new place.[647]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 646:\r\n\r\n  Contrast Coke, _Second Institute_, 32, who seems to suggest that one\r\n  effect of Magna Carta was to take from the sheriff a jurisdiction over\r\n  _thefts_ previously enjoyed by him.\r\n\r\nFootnote 647:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, I. 650, thinks that the proposals of the\r\n  Articles and Charter indicated a tendency towards judicial absolutism,\r\n  only curbed by the growth of trial by jury. Yet the barons in\r\n  providing against the sheriff’s irregularities had certainly no\r\n  intention to enhance the royal power. The attitude of the insurgents\r\n  in 1215 suggests rather that the sheriffs had now become instruments\r\n  of royal absolutism to a greater extent than the king’s justices\r\n  themselves. The problem of local government had thus assumed a new\r\n  form (cf. _supra_, p. 20). Edward I., indeed, deftly turned this\r\n  chapter to his own advantage, arguing that it cancelled all private\r\n  jurisdiction over criminal pleas previously claimed by boroughs or\r\n  individuals. See Coke, _Second Institute_, 31, and cases there cited.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nV. _Local Magistrates under John._ The urgent need of preventing the\r\npetty tyrants who controlled the administration of the various districts\r\nfrom exercising jurisdiction over the lives and limbs of freemen can be\r\nabundantly illustrated from the details furnished by contemporary\r\nrecords of the ingenious and cruel oppressions they constantly resorted\r\nto. Ineffectual attempts had indeed been made more than once to restrain\r\ntheir evil practices, as in August, 1213, when directions were issued\r\nfrom the Council of St. Alban’s commanding the sheriffs, foresters, and\r\nothers, to abstain from unjust dealing,[648] and, again, some two months\r\nlater, when John, at the instance of Nicholas of Tusculum, the papal\r\nlegate, promised to restrain their violence and illegal exactions.[649]\r\nLittle or nothing, however, was effected in the way of reform; and Magna\r\nCarta, in addition to condemning certain specified evils, contained two\r\ngeneral provisions, namely, chapter 45, which indicated what type of men\r\nshould be appointed as Crown officials, and the present chapter, which\r\nforbade local magistrates to encroach on the province of the king’s\r\njustices. These local magistrates are comprehensively described under\r\nfour different names.[650]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 648:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, p. 34.\r\n\r\nFootnote 649:\r\n\r\n  See W. Coventry, II. 214-5.\r\n\r\nFootnote 650:\r\n\r\n  Abuses by sheriffs and other bailiffs continued to be rife after 1215\r\n  as before it. Many later statutes afford graphic illustrations of the\r\n  oppressive conduct they sought to control. In 1275 Edward found it\r\n  necessary to provide “that the sheriffs from henceforth shall not\r\n  lodge with any person, with more than five or six horses; and that\r\n  they shall not grieve religious men nor others, by often coming and\r\n  lodging, neither at their houses nor at their manors.” See Statute of\r\n  Westminster, c. 1, confirmed by 28 Edward I., stat. 3, c. 13.\r\n\r\n(1) _The sheriff._ No royal officer was better or more justly hated than\r\nthe sheriff. The chapter under discussion affords strong evidence alike\r\nof his importance and of the jealousy with which his power was viewed.\r\nThe very briefest sketch of the origin and growth of the office is all\r\nthat is here possible. Long before the Conquest, in each shire of\r\nEngland, the interests, financial and otherwise, of the kings of the\r\nroyal house of Wessex had been entrusted to an agent or man of business\r\nof their own appointing, known as a _scir-gerefa_ (or shire-reeve).\r\nThese officers were continued by the Norman monarchs with increased\r\npowers under the new name of _vice comites_.[651] It is an illustration\r\nof the tenacity of the Anglo-Saxon customs and names that this Latin\r\ntitle never took root, whereas the old title of sheriff continues to the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 651:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, pp. 17-20.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt is true that in England during the Anglo-Saxon period the chief power\r\nover each shire or group of shires had been shared among three\r\nofficers—the bishop, the earl, and the sheriff. The bishop, by the\r\nnatural differentiation of functions, soon confined his labours to the\r\nspiritual affairs of his diocese; while the deliberate policy of the\r\nConqueror and his successors relegated the earl to a position of dignity\r\naltogether severed from the possession of real power. Thus the sheriff\r\nwas left without a rival within his shire. For a period of at least one\r\nhundred years after the Norman Conquest he wielded an excessive local\r\nauthority as the sole tyrant of the county. He was not indeed\r\nirresponsible, but it was difficult for his victims to obtain the ear of\r\nthe distant king, who alone was strong enough to punish him. The zenith\r\nof the sheriff’s power, however, was passed in the twelfth century, and\r\nbefore its close changes had been introduced with the view of checking\r\nhis abuses. Henry II. frequently punished his sheriffs for their\r\nmisdeeds, and removed them from office.\r\n\r\nIt has already been explained how in 1194 the sheriff’s powers were\r\nfurther restricted, while new officers were appointed in each county to\r\nshare the authority still left to him. To the very next year (1195) is\r\nusually traced the origin of the justices of the peace, who gradually\r\ntook over the chief duties of the sheriff until they had practically\r\nsuperseded him as the ruling power in the county. In Tudor days a new\r\nrival appeared in the Lord Lieutenant, then first appointed in each\r\nshire to represent the Crown in its military capacity, and particularly\r\nto take over command of the militia of the county. The fall of the\r\nsheriff from his former high estate was thus gradual, although finally\r\nmost complete. From presiding, as he did in his golden age, over all the\r\nbusiness of the district—financial, administrative, military, and\r\njudicial—the sheriff has become, in England at the present day, a mere\r\nhonorary figure-head of the county executive. A high sheriff is still\r\nchosen annually by King Edward for each county by picking at random one\r\nname out of a list of three leading land-owners presented to him for\r\nthat purpose by the judges. The gentleman on whom this sometimes\r\nunwelcome dignity is thrust is still nominally responsible during his\r\nyear of office for the execution of all writs of the superior Courts\r\nwithin his county, for returning the names of those elected to serve in\r\nthe House of Commons, and for many other purposes; but his\r\nresponsibility is chiefly theoretical. All the real duties of his office\r\nare now performed in practice by subordinates. What really remains to\r\nhim is an empty and expensive honour, usually shunned rather than\r\ncourted. In Scotland and America the sheriff also exists at the present\r\nday, but his position and functions have in these countries developed in\r\nvery different directions. In Scotland, in opposition to what has\r\nhappened in England and America, the sheriff has remained emphatically a\r\njudicial officer, the judge of an inferior court, namely, the local\r\ncourt of his shire, known as “the Sheriff Court.” He has thus retained\r\nintact his judicial functions, to which such nominal administrative\r\nduties as still remain to him are entirely subordinate. In the United\r\nStates of America, on the contrary, the sheriff is a purely executive\r\nofficial, possessing perhaps more real power, but notably less honour\r\nand social distinction than fall to the lot of the English high sheriff.\r\nThe duties of his office are sometimes performed by him in person; he\r\nmay even set out at the head of the _posse comitatus_ in pursuit of\r\ncriminals. Three completely different offices have thus sprung from the\r\nsame constitutional root, and all three are still known by one name in\r\nEngland, Scotland, and America respectively.\r\n\r\n(2) _The constable._ Portions of certain counties were exempted,\r\npartially or entirely, from the sheriff’s bailiwick, and placed under\r\nthe authority of specially appointed magistrates. Thus districts\r\nafforested were administered by forest wardens assisted by verderers who\r\nexcluded the sheriffs and coroners; while royal fortresses, together\r\nwith the land immediately surrounding them, were under the sole command\r\nof officers known indifferently as castellans or constables.[652] The\r\noffices of warden of a particular forest and warden of an adjacent royal\r\ncastle were frequently conferred on the same individual. Indeed, chapter\r\n16 of the Forest Charter of Henry III. seems to use the term\r\n“castellans” as the recognized name of forest wardens, whom it forbids\r\nto hold “pleas of the forest,” although they may attach or “keep” them\r\n(with the co-operation of the verderers), and present them for trial\r\nbefore the king’s emissaries when next sent to hold a forest eyre—thus\r\noffering a complete parallel between procedure at “forest pleas” and\r\nthat prescribed by the present chapter for ordinary pleas of the\r\nCrown.[653]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 652:\r\n\r\n  These localities were completely independent of the ordinary executive\r\n  authorities of the county; in addition, partial exemption from the\r\n  sheriff’s control was enjoyed by (_a_) chartered boroughs and (_b_)\r\n  holders of franchises.\r\n\r\nFootnote 653:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _infra_, c. 48.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe name constable is an ambiguous one, since it has at different\r\nperiods of history been applied to officers of extremely different\r\ntypes. The king’s High Constable, a descendant of the horse-thegn of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon kings, was originally that member of the royal household who\r\nwas specially responsible for the king’s stables. At a later date, he\r\nshared with the Earl Marshal the duties of Commander-in-chief of the\r\nking’s armies. The name of constable was also used in a wider sense to\r\ndesignate other and subordinate royal ministers. It came to be applied\r\nto commanders of small bodies of troops, whether in castles or\r\nelsewhere. At a later date the word lost its warlike associations, and\r\nwas used in connection with the duties of watch and ward. A constable\r\nwas a person specially entrusted with enforcing order in his own\r\nlocality. Thus each hundred had its high constable and each village its\r\npetty constable in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.[654] These\r\nvarious officials were thus, at different dates, all designated by a\r\nname usually, at the present day, confined to ordinary members of the\r\npolice force.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 654:\r\n\r\n  See H. B. Simpson in _English Historical Review_, X. 625, and\r\n  authorities there cited.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe word as used in Magna Carta had not yet lost its military character,\r\nbut denoted the castellan who commanded the troops which garrisoned a\r\nroyal castle.[655] Such an office was one of great trust; and\r\ncorrespondingly wide powers were conferred upon its holder. The warden\r\nof a castle held an important military command, and acted as gaoler of\r\nthe prisoners confided to the safe-keeping of his dungeons. He had\r\nauthority, under certain ill-defined restrictions, to take whatever he\r\nthought necessary for provisioning the garrison—a privilege, the\r\nexercise of which frequently led to abuses, guarded against by chapters\r\n28 and 29 of Magna Carta, where they are discussed under the head of\r\npurveyance. He had also, to a limited extent, judicial authority. Not\r\nonly did he try pleas for small debts to which Jews were parties, but he\r\nenjoyed a jurisdiction over all petty offences committed within the\r\nprecincts of the castle, analogous to that of the sheriff within the\r\nrest of the county. This power of trying and punishing misdemeanours was\r\nnot taken away by the Great Charter, and was confirmed by implication in\r\n1300 by a statute which directed that the constable of Dover Castle\r\nshould not hold within the castle gate “foreign” pleas of the county\r\nwhich did not affect “the guard of the castle.”[656] It is not known at\r\nwhat date the judicial powers of constables fell into disuse; but they\r\nstill acted as gaolers at a much later period. In the reign of Henry IV.\r\ncomplaint was made that constables of castles were appointed justices of\r\nthe peace, and imprisoned in one capacity the victims whom they had\r\nunjustly condemned in another. This practice was put down by statute in\r\n1403.[657]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 655:\r\n\r\n  The evidence collected by Coke, _Second Institute_, 31, conclusively\r\n  proves the identity of these two offices. See also Round, _Ancient\r\n  Charters_ No. 55, where Richard I. in 1159 speaks of “_constabularia\r\n  castelli Lincolniae_.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 656:\r\n\r\n  See _Articuli super cartas_, 28 Edward I. c. 7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 657:\r\n\r\n  See 5 Henry IV. c. 10. Coke, _Second Institute_, 30, relates, as an\r\n  indication of the authority and pretensions of these constables, that\r\n  they had seals of their own “with their portraiture on horseback.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt would seem that at an earlier period the constable sometimes acted as\r\na deputy-sheriff. Chapter 12 of the Assize of Northampton provided that\r\nwhen the sheriff was absent the nearest _castellanus_ might take his\r\nplace in dealing with a thief who had been arrested. His interference\r\noutside his own precincts must, however, have been regarded with great\r\njealousy, and the coroners, after their appointment in 1194, would\r\nnaturally act as substitutes during the sheriff’s absence.\r\n\r\n(3) _The coroners._ The coroners of each county, after their institution\r\nin 1194, seem to have shared with the sheriff most of the powers of\r\nwhich the latter had previously enjoyed a monopoly. The nature of their\r\nduties is explained by the oath of office sworn in the same words for\r\nmany centuries, “_ad custodienda ea quae pertinent ad coronam_.” Their\r\nduty was to guard royal interests generally; and their “keeping” of\r\nroyal pleas was merely one aspect of this wider function. Besides\r\n“attaching” those suspected of crimes—that is, receiving formal\r\naccusations and taking such sureties as might be necessary, it was their\r\nduty to make all such preliminary investigations as might throw light on\r\nthe case when the formal trial was afterwards held; they had, for\r\nexample, to examine the size and nature of the victim’s wounds in a\r\ncharge of mayhem.[658] They were required, in particular, to keep a\r\nwatchful eye on all royal property, being responsible for the\r\nsafe-keeping of deodands, wrecks, and treasure trove. They had also to\r\nappraise the value of all chattels of criminals forfeited to the king.\r\nWhen felons took refuge in sanctuary, it was the coroner who arranged\r\nfor their leaving the country on forfeiting all that they had. They also\r\nkept a record of those who had been outlawed, and received “appeals” or\r\nprivate accusations of criminal charges.[659]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 658:\r\n\r\n  See Bracton, f. 122 b.\r\n\r\nFootnote 659:\r\n\r\n  In 1197, Richard’s Assize of Measures appointed six _custodientes_ in\r\n  each county and town. These were _coroners_ over a limited class of\r\n  offences, viz., the use of false weights and measures. Cf. _infra_,\r\n  under c. 35.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMagna Carta forbade the coroner to determine the pleas of the Crown;\r\nbut, even after 1215, he sometimes did justice upon felons caught\r\nred-handed, whose guilt was self-evident without trial. An act of Edward\r\nI.[660] accurately defined his duties, empowering him to attach pleas of\r\nthe Crown and to present criminals to the justices for trial, but\r\nforbidding him to proceed further alone.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 660:\r\n\r\n  Statute of Westminster, I. c. 10.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe coroner’s functions, originally so wide and varied, have been\r\ngradually narrowed down, until now there is practically only one duty\r\ncommonly associated with his office, namely, the holding of an inquest\r\non a dead body where there are suspicious circumstances.[661] In\r\naddition to this, however, he is still responsible for treasure-trove or\r\nvaluables found buried in the ground, and he is also competent to act\r\ngenerally as the substitute of the sheriff in case of the latter’s\r\nillness or absence during his year of office.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 661:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Coke, _Second Institute_, 31, “In case when any man come to\r\n  violent or untimely death, _super visum corporis_.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(4) _The bailiffs._ The mention by name of three classes of local\r\nofficers is supplemented by the addition of an indefinite word\r\nsufficiently wide to cover all grades of Crown officials. The term\r\n“bailiff” may be correctly applied to every individual to whom authority\r\nof any sort has been delegated by another. It would, in the present\r\ninstance, include the assistants of sheriffs and constables, the men who\r\nactually served writs, or distrained the goods of debtors; and also\r\ngenerally all local officials of every description holding authority\r\ndirectly or indirectly from the Crown. The district over which his\r\noffice extended was called his “bailiwick,” a term often applied to the\r\ncounty considered as the sphere of the sheriff’s labours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE.\r\n\r\nOmnes comitatus, hundrede, wapentakii, et trethingic, sint ad antiquas\r\nfirmas absque ullo incremento, exceptis dominicis maneriis nostris.\r\n\r\n  All counties, hundreds, wapentakes, and trithings (except our demesne\r\n  manors) shall remain at the old rents, and without any additional\r\n  payment.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis provision also was directed against the sheriffs, and shows a\r\npraiseworthy determination to get to the root of the disease, instead of\r\nmerely attacking the symptoms. The rents at which the counties (or parts\r\nof them) were farmed out to the sheriffs must no longer be arbitrarily\r\nraised, but were to remain at the old figures which had become\r\nstereotyped from long usage. To understand how such increases would\r\ninjuriously affect the inhabitants of the county, some explanation is\r\nnecessary. Centuries before the Norman Conquest, the long process had\r\nbeen already completed by which England had been gradually mapped out\r\ninto shires on lines substantially the same as those which still exist.\r\nEach county had been further subdivided into smaller districts known as\r\n“hundreds” in the south, and as “wapentakes” in the Danish districts of\r\nthe north; while intermediate divisions existed, exceptionally, in some\r\nof the specially large counties such as York and Lincoln, each of which\r\nhad three “trithings” or ridings.\r\n\r\nIn commenting upon chapter 24, it has been already explained how the\r\nAnglo-Saxon kings entrusted their interests in each shire to an officer\r\ncalled a sheriff, and how a similar officer under the Norman kings\r\nbecame practically the chief magistrate and local judge in the county.\r\nHis financial duties, however, long remained the most important: William\r\nI. and his successors had greater pecuniary interests in the English\r\ncounties than their Anglo-Saxon forerunners ever had, and the sheriffs\r\nwere their agents in collecting all rents and other dues. Even before\r\nthe Conquest, however, the sheriff of an ordinary county had ceased to\r\nbe a mere intermediary, who lifted the king’s rents and paid over, pound\r\nby pound, the yearly varying sums he might receive. He had become a\r\n_firmarius_: he bought for a yearly rent the right to collect and\r\nappropriate to his own uses the various revenues of the county. The\r\nCrown got only the exact sum stipulated for, known as the _firma\r\ncomitatus_; while the balance, if any, remained with the sheriff. That\r\nofficer was liable, on the other hand, for the sum agreed on, even when\r\nthe annual yield fell short of his anticipations. In plain words, the\r\nsheriff speculated in the returns, and it was his business, by fair\r\nmeans or foul, to make sure of a handsome surplus.\r\n\r\nAuthorities differ as to the exact list of items purchased by the slump\r\nsum known as _firma comitatus_; but undoubtedly the two chief sources of\r\nrevenue embraced were the profits of justice dispensed in the local\r\ncourts, and the rents and returns from the various royal manors in the\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nWilliam I. sharply raised the amounts of all these farms for his own\r\nbenefit, and his successors endeavoured, whenever possible, to increase\r\nthem still further. Now it might seem at first sight that these\r\nadditional burdens concerned exclusively the Crown and the sheriff, but\r\nsuch was by no means the case. The sheriff took care to pass on the\r\nburden primarily falling upon him to the shoulders of those who were\r\nsubject to his authority. When the king exacted more from the sheriff,\r\nthe latter in turn increased the pressure on the inhabitants of his\r\ncounty or group of counties. His rule tended always to be oppressive,\r\nbut his unjust fines and exactions would be doubled at times when the\r\namount of the _firma_ had recently been raised.\r\n\r\nUnder the vigilant rule of Henry II. some measure of relief was obtained\r\nby the shires from the misdeeds of their local tyrants, since that\r\nfar-seeing king knew that his own best interests called for a\r\ncurtailment of the pretensions of the sheriffs. He punished their\r\nexcesses, and frequently deprived them of office. Under John the\r\nsheriffs had a comparatively free hand to oppress their victims, for he\r\nentered into a tacit alliance with them, in order that the two tyrants\r\n(the heads of the central and the local government respectively) might\r\ntogether fleece the men of the county more effectually. In addition to\r\nthe fixed annual rents in name of _firma_ which had again become\r\nstereotyped, John extorted an additional lump payment called either an\r\n_incrementum_ or by various other names, and allowed the sheriffs to\r\ninflict new severities in order to recoup themselves for their\r\nadditional outlay.[662]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 662:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Miss Norgate (_John Lackland_, p. 214) who explains that the Crown\r\n  claimed a share of the sheriffs’ ever-increasing surplus, and \"this\r\n  was done, not by putting the ferm at a higher figure, but by charging\r\n  the sheriff with an additional lump sum under the title of\r\n  _crementum_, or, in John’s time, _proficuum_.“ But this practice was\r\n  by no means an innovation invented by John. Henry II. often exacted\r\n  such extra payments under the name of ”_gersuma_.\" Thus in _Pipe Roll_\r\n  Henry II. (p. 11) the Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk paid 200 marks\r\n  under that name. The method adopted was practically to set up the\r\n  office of sheriff to auction. The highest suitable bidder obtained the\r\n  post, and the amount of the successful bid was entered at the\r\n  exchequer as a _gersuma_.\r\n\r\nMagna Carta made no attempt to abolish the practice of farming out the\r\nshires, but forbade alike the increase of the farm and the exaction of\r\nan _incrementum_.\r\n\r\nIf this reform benefited the men of the counties in their dealings with\r\nthe sheriffs, it also gave the sheriffs an unfair advantage over the\r\nexchequer. The total value of the various assets included in the _firma\r\ncomitatus_ had greatly increased in the past, and would probably\r\ncontinue to increase in the future. Therefore, it was absurd to bind the\r\nCrown by a hard-and-fast rule which would practically make a present of\r\nthis future “unearned increment” to the sheriff. It belonged of right to\r\nthe Crown; and the exchequer had increasing need of supplies to meet the\r\nincreasing duties of the central government. To stereotype the _firma_\r\nto be paid in return for a constantly increasing revenue was unfair to\r\nthe Crown.[663] It is thus easy to understand why this chapter was\r\nentirely omitted in 1216 and in subsequent reissues. The _Articuli super\r\ncartas_, on the other hand, while conceding to the counties the right of\r\nelecting their own sheriffs, reaffirmed the principle of John’s Charter,\r\ndeclaring that neither the bailiwicks and hundreds of the king, nor\r\nthose of great lords ought to be put to farm at too high rates. The\r\nevil, however, continued under a new form; sheriffs, while only paying a\r\nmoderate farm themselves, sublet parts of their province at much higher\r\nrates, thus appropriating the increment denied to the exchequer, while\r\nthe bailiffs who had paid the increase could not “levy the said ferm\r\nwithout doing extortion and duress to the people.”[664] Three successive\r\nacts prohibited this practice, declaring that hundreds and wapentakes\r\nmust either be kept in the sheriff’s own hands, or sublet, if at all, at\r\nthe old fixed farms only.[665]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 663:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Sir James Ramsay, _Angevin Empire_, 476, who describes this\r\n  provision as “an impossible requirement.” Dr. Stubbs’ paraphrase is\r\n  not entirely happy: “the ferms of the counties and other jurisdictions\r\n  are not to be increased.” See _Const. Hist._ I. 575.\r\n\r\nFootnote 664:\r\n\r\n  These are the words of the Statute of 1330, cited below.\r\n\r\nFootnote 665:\r\n\r\n  See 4 Edward III. c. 15; 14 Edward III. c. 9; and 4 Henry IV. c. 5.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOne exception to the scope of its own provisions was deliberately made\r\nby Magna Carta—an exception of an important and notable nature; the\r\ndemesne manors of the Crown were deliberately left exposed to arbitrary\r\nincreases of their annual rents. The towns in this respect were\r\npractically in the same position as the demesne manors. It is true that\r\nmany of them had received separate charters fixing the amounts annually\r\npayable under the name of farm (_firma burgi_ in their case), and that\r\nall such charters received a general confirmation in chapter 13 of the\r\nGreat Charter, but the Crown could probably evade these promises by\r\napplying the name of “increment” to any additional payments desired, or,\r\nif that were objected to, might still resort to an arbitrary “tallage,”\r\nthe right to extort which had not been taken away by Magna Carta. The\r\nmoney was as good to the Crown under one name as under another.[666]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 666:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, pp. 278-80.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX.\r\n\r\nSi aliquis tenens de nobis laicum feodum moriatur, et vicecomes vel\r\nballivus noster ostendat litteras nostras patentes de summonicione\r\nnostra de debito quod defunctus nobis debuit, liceat vicecomiti vel\r\nballivo nostro attachiare et inbreviare catalla defuncti, inventa in\r\nlaico feodo, ad valenciam illius debiti, per visum legalium hominum, ita\r\ntamen quod nichil inde amoveatur, donec persolvatur nobis debitum quod\r\nclarum fuerit; et residuum relinquatur executoribus ad faciendum\r\ntestamentum defuncti; et, si nichil nobis debeatur ab ipso, omnia\r\ncatalla cedant defuncto, salvis uxori ipsius et pueris racionabilibus\r\npartibus suis.\r\n\r\n  If any one holding of us a lay fief shall die, and our sheriff or\r\n  bailiff shall exhibit our letters patent of summons for a debt which\r\n  the deceased owed to us, it shall be lawful for our sheriff or bailiff\r\n  to attach and catalogue chattels of the deceased, found upon the lay\r\n  fief, to the value of that debt, at the sight of lawful men, provided\r\n  always that nothing whatever be thence removed until the debt which is\r\n  evident[667] shall be fully paid to us; and the residue shall be left\r\n  to the executors to fulfil the will of the deceased; and if there be\r\n  nothing due from him to us, all the chattels shall go to the deceased,\r\n  saving to his wife and children their reasonable shares.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 667:\r\n\r\n  Cf. the use of the phrase “a liquid debt” in Scots law.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe primary object of this chapter was to regulate the procedure to be\r\nfollowed in attaching the personal estates of Crown tenants who were\r\nalso Crown debtors. Incidentally, however, it throws light on the\r\ngeneral question of the right of bequeathing property.\r\n\r\nI. _The Nature of the Grievance._ When a Crown tenant died it was almost\r\ncertain that arrears of one or other of the numerous scutages,\r\nincidents, or other payments due to the Crown remained unpaid. The\r\nsheriff and the bailiffs of the district where the deceased’s estates\r\nlay were in the habit of seizing everything they could find on his manor\r\nunder the excuse of securing the interests of their royal master. They\r\nattached and sold chattels out of all proportion to the sum actually\r\ndue; and after satisfying the Crown debt, a large surplus would often\r\nremain in the sheriff’s hands which it would be exceedingly difficult\r\nfor the relatives of the deceased freeholder to force him to disgorge.\r\n\r\nMagna Carta here sought to make such irregularities impossible for the\r\nfuture by carefully defining the exact procedure to be followed in such\r\ncircumstances. The sheriff and his bailiffs were forbidden to touch a\r\nsingle chattel of a deceased Crown tenant, unless they came armed with a\r\nlegal warrant in the form of royal letters patent vouching the existence\r\nand the amount of the Crown debt. Even after exhibiting a warrant in\r\nproper form, the officers were only allowed to attach as many chattels\r\nas could reasonably be considered necessary to satisfy the full value of\r\nthe debt due to the exchequer; and everything so taken must be carefully\r\ninventoried. All this was to be done “at the sight of lawful men,”\r\nrespectable, if humble, neighbours specially summoned for that purpose,\r\nwhose function it was to form a check on the actions of the sheriff’s\r\nofficers generally, to prevent them from appropriating anything not\r\nincluded in the inventory, to assist in valuing each article and to see\r\nthat no more chattels were distrained than necessary. A saving clause\r\nprotected the interests of the Crown by forbidding the removal from the\r\ntenant’s fief of any of the chattels, even those not so attached, until\r\nthe full ascertained amount had actually been paid to the exchequer. The\r\nCrown’s preferential claims remained over everything on the manor until\r\nthe debt was extinguished. Only after that had been done, could a\r\ndivision of the estate take place among the deceased man’s relatives or\r\nthose in whose favour he had executed a Will.\r\n\r\nThese provisions should be read in connection with the terms of chapter\r\n9,[668] which provided that diligence for Crown debts must proceed\r\nagainst personal estate before the debtor’s freehold was distrained, and\r\nlaid down other equitable rules applicable alike to the case of a\r\ndeceased Crown debtor and to that of a living one.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 668:\r\n\r\n  Cf. what is there said of the sheriff’s oppressions and the attempts\r\n  made to put an end to them.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nII. _The Right to Bequeath._ The main interest of this chapter lies,\r\nhowever, for the historian of law and institutions, in quite a different\r\ndirection; to him it is valuable for the light incidentally thrown on\r\nthe limits within which the right of making Wills was recognized in\r\n1215. The early law of England seems to have had great difficulty in\r\ndeciding how far it ought to acknowledge the claims made by owners of\r\nproperty, both real and personal, to direct its destination after death.\r\nVarious influences were at work, prior to the Norman Conquest, to make\r\nthe development of this branch of law illogical and capricious.[669] Of\r\nthe law of bequests in the twelfth century, however, it is possible to\r\nspeak with greater certainty; definite principles had by that time\r\nreceived general recognition. All testamentary rights over land or other\r\nreal estate (so far as these had ever actually existed) were now\r\nabolished, not, as has sometimes been maintained, in the interest of the\r\nfeudal lord, but rather in the interests of the expectant heir.[670]\r\nThus the right to devise land had been absolutely prohibited before the\r\nend of the twelfth century. Many reasons contributed to this result. For\r\none thing, it had become necessary to prevent churchmen from using their\r\ninfluence to wring bequests of land from dying men, to the\r\nimpoverishment of the rightful heir, and to the destruction of the due\r\nbalance between Church and State, already menaced by the rapidly\r\naccumulating wealth of the various religious orders.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 669:\r\n\r\n  The subject is exhaustively discussed by Pollock and Maitland, II.\r\n  312-353.\r\n\r\nFootnote 670:\r\n\r\n  See Pollock and Maitland, II. 324.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nChurchmen, in compensation as it were for the obstacles thus opposed to\r\ntheir thirst for the land of the dying, made good their claim to\r\nregulate all Wills dealing with personal estate; that is money, goods,\r\nand chattels. They claimed and obtained for their own courts the right\r\nto exclusive jurisdiction over all testamentary provisions, now, of\r\ncourse, competent in respect of personal estate only. The Courts\r\nChristian “proved” Wills, (that is, usurped the right to determine\r\nwhether they were really valid acts of the departed or not) and also\r\nsuperintended their administration. In particular, they had control over\r\nthe “executors” who were originally the friends to whom the deceased had\r\nmade known his wishes as to the distribution of his money and chattels\r\non his death. The Church Courts ensured that the executors loyally\r\ncarried out these intentions, and prevented them from appropriating to\r\ntheir own uses what had been entrusted to them for the good of the\r\ndeceased’s soul. In John’s reign, however, the Crown and its officers\r\ninterfered alike with the rights of testators to make Wills and the\r\nrights of the bishop of the diocese to supervise the distribution. Not\r\nonly did the sheriffs find pretexts to help themselves; but John seems\r\nto have maintained that Wills were not valid without his consent, which\r\nhad, as usual, to be paid for. Such, at least, is the inference to be\r\ndrawn from the existence of writs granting licences to make a Will, or\r\nconfirming one that had been made.[671] The king’s interference in this\r\nprovince seems, however, to have been regarded as an entirely illegal\r\nencroachment.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 671:\r\n\r\n  On 30th August, 1199 (_New Rymer_, I. 78) John confirmed the testament\r\n  of Archbishop Hubert Walter; and on 22nd July, 1202, (_Ibid._, I. 86)\r\n  he granted permission to his mother, the dowager Queen Eleanor, to\r\n  make a Will.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn strict law, rights of testation, though prohibited _quoad_ land, were\r\nrecognized _quoad_ personal estate. It must not, however, be supposed\r\nthat the testator was at liberty to divide or “devise” all his money and\r\nchattels. The reasonable claims of wife and children must first be\r\nrespected, and only the free balance, after satisfying these, could be\r\ndistributed. It was long before any exact rule was established for\r\ndetermining the amount of these “reasonable” claims. Much could be said\r\nfor an elastic rule which allowed the proportion of personal estate\r\nfalling to wife and children to vary with the circumstances of each\r\ncase; but this vagueness had one grave objection; it inevitably led to\r\nfriction and family quarrels. Magna Carta in this respect simply\r\nconfirmed existing practice, and made no attempt at definition. During\r\nthe thirteenth century, however, the lawful shares of wife and children\r\nwere definitely fixed by the English common law, and that, too, at\r\nexactly the same proportions of the entire personal estate as are\r\nrecognized to the present day by the law of Scotland. Where a Scots\r\ntestator dies leaving wife and children, his moveable or personal estate\r\nis regarded as falling naturally into three equal parts, known as the\r\nwidow’s part, the bairn’s part, and the dead’s part, respectively. It is\r\nonly with the last mentioned third of his own moveables that he can do\r\nas he likes. If he disposes of the rest, wife and children may claim\r\ntheir legal rights and “break the Will.” Where a wife survives but no\r\nchildren, or _vice versa_, the division is into two equal portions.\r\nMagna Carta recognises a similar threefold or twofold decision, and\r\ncontains a clear acknowledgment of what Scots law to the present day\r\nquaintly describes as \"the dead’s part.\" It was only the residue of the\r\ndeceased’s chattels after claims of wife and children had been\r\nsatisfied, which was “to fall to the deceased,” and which is also spoken\r\nof as the portion of personal estate left to the executors “to fulfil\r\nthe testament of the deceased.” This portion was appropriated “to the\r\nuse of the dead”: that is, his executors, under the guidance of the\r\nChurch Courts, would use it for the salvation of his soul. The deceased\r\nmight either have given specific directions, or have left full powers to\r\nhis executors (frequently churchmen) to make the division for charitable\r\nand religious purposes according to their own discretion. Part might go\r\nto needy relations, or to the poor of the district; part to endow\r\nreligious houses; and part in masses for his eternal welfare.\r\n\r\nLong subsequent to the thirteenth century, the laws of England and\r\nScotland as to the rights of succession of wife and children seem to\r\nhave remained identical: but, while Scots law is the same to the present\r\nday, recognizing still the widow’s _jus relictae_ and the children’s\r\n_legitim_, the English law has, by slow steps, the details of which are\r\nobscure, entirely changed. The rule which acknowledged the children’s\r\nright to one third of the personal estate was gradually relaxed, while\r\nthe testator became sole judge what provision he ought to make for his\r\nsons, until at last a purely nominal sum of money was all that was\r\nrequired. Finally the power to bequeath personal estate has (in sympathy\r\nwith exaggerated modern conceptions of the sacredness of rights of\r\n“property”) expanded to such an extent that a father may leave his\r\nchildren entirely penniless; and the law will not interfere. The law of\r\nEngland, at the present day, does not compel him to leave his son or\r\ndaughter even the proverbial shilling. The phrase “to cut off a son with\r\na shilling,” which still lives in popular usage, may possibly perpetuate\r\na now forgotten tradition of an intermediate stage of English law, where\r\nsome provision, however inadequate, had to be made, if the Will was to\r\nbe allowed to stand.[672]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 672:\r\n\r\n  The reissue of 1216 makes no alteration here, but that of 1217 omits\r\n  “_et pueris_,” thus protecting the wife’s “reasonable portion” but not\r\n  that of the sons. The words omitted were restored in 1225. It was\r\n  probably a mere clerical error.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN.\r\n\r\nSi aliquis liber homo intestatus decesserit, catalla sua per manus\r\npropinquorum parentum et amicorum suorum, per visum ecclesie\r\ndistribuantur, salvis unicuique debitis que defunctus ei debebat.\r\n\r\n  If any freeman shall die intestate, his chattels shall be distributed\r\n  by the hands of his nearest kinsfolk and friends, under the\r\n  supervision of the church, saving to every one the debts which the\r\n  deceased owed to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere the Great Charter proceeds to remedy an evil connected with\r\n_intestate_ succession, a natural sequel to the subject of _testate_\r\nsuccession. John was made to promise that he would not seize, as forfeit\r\nto his exchequer, the chattels of men who had neglected to make a will.\r\nIn the Middle Ages all classes of men, good and bad alike, exhibited an\r\nextreme horror of dying intestate.[673] Several causes contributed\r\ntowards this frame of mind. Churchmen, from motives not unmixed,\r\ndiligently inculcated the belief that a dying man’s duty was to leave\r\npart at least of his personal estate (the only property over which the\r\nlaw allowed him powers of disposal) for religious and charitable\r\nobjects. The bishop or priest, who had power to give or withhold extreme\r\nunction to the sinner who had confessed his sins, was in a peculiarly\r\nstrong position to enforce his advice upon men who believed the Church\r\nto hold the keys of heaven. Thus, every man on his death-bed had\r\npowerful motives for making his will in such form as the Church\r\napproved. Motives of a more worldly kind urged him in the same\r\ndirection. If he died intestate, a scramble for his personal effects\r\nwould undoubtedly result. Many powerful claimants were ready to compete.\r\nIn Glanvill’s day, for example,[674] every feudal lord claimed the goods\r\nof his intestate vassals. Such demands were difficult to defeat,\r\nalthough Bracton, at a later date[675] declared them to be illegal, at\r\nleast in cases of sudden death. Then, the kinsmen—rich and poor\r\nrelations—had certain rights never very clearly defined. The Church,\r\ntoo, stood ready, with claims judiciously vague, which might be expanded\r\nas occasion required. It arrogated, at the very lowest, the right to\r\ndistribute the dead man’s chattels for the good of his soul, and there\r\nare instances when a strong-minded bishop or abbot insisted on such a\r\ndistribution, although the deceased had died unrepentant, leaving no\r\nwill.[676]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 673:\r\n\r\n  Pollock and Maitland, II. 354.\r\n\r\nFootnote 674:\r\n\r\n  VII c. 16.\r\n\r\nFootnote 675:\r\n\r\n  F. 60 b.\r\n\r\nFootnote 676:\r\n\r\n  This course was taken in 1197 by Abbot Samson, whose deeds are\r\n  portrayed for us by Jocelyn of Brakelond to the delight of Thomas\r\n  Carlyle. See _Past and Present_, _passim_. Cf. also Pollock and\r\n  Maitland, II. 355.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nPrelates allowed themselves liberal discretion in regard to \"the dead’s\r\npart\" over which they thus assumed control. Something might go to the\r\npoor, but much would naturally be spent on masses for the departed soul,\r\nwhile a portion might openly be retained as a recompense for trouble\r\nexpended in this pious cause. The king was another competitor for the\r\ngoods of those who left no will; and attempts were made at various times\r\nto treat intestacy, more especially in the case of clerks, as a cause of\r\nforfeiture.[677] For our present purpose it is unnecessary to discuss\r\nwhether this claim was founded on the royal prerogative or on the rights\r\nof the king in his capacity either as overlord or as patron of vacant\r\nsees.[678]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 677:\r\n\r\n  See Pollock and Maitland, II. 354. Examples are readily found: “When\r\n  Archbishop Roger of York died in 1182, Henry II. enjoyed a windfall of\r\n  £11,000, to say nothing of the spoons and saltcellars.” Pollock and\r\n  Maitland, I. 504.\r\n\r\nFootnote 678:\r\n\r\n  Royal prerogatives in the twelfth century were still elastic and\r\n  undefined. Henry II. used them freely, but on the whole fairly. His\r\n  sons stretched every doubtful claim to its utmost limits. The Crown\r\n  was the legal heir of all Jews (cf. c. 10) and apparently of all\r\n  Christian usurers as well, at least of such as died unrepentant. (See\r\n  Pollock and Maitland, II. 486, and authorities there cited.) It is\r\n  interesting in this connection to note that the making of a will was\r\n  looked on as a necessary condition of a usurer’s repentance. (See\r\n  _Dialogus de Scaccario_, 224–5, nn.) The king, further, took the goods\r\n  of all who died a felon’s death (cf. c. 32) and of men who committed\r\n  suicide (itself a felony). John, so we may infer from Magna Carta,\r\n  went further, and appropriated the chattels of all intestates. Were\r\n  there any precedents from his father’s reign for this wider claim?\r\n  Madox (I. 346) cites an entry from the _Pipe Polls_ of 1172, recording\r\n  60 marks due the exchequer as the value of the chattels of an\r\n  intestate; and, two years later, mention is made _de pecunia\r\n  Gilleberti qui obiit intestatus_. There is nothing to show whether\r\n  such men were, or were not, usurers. The Pope was another competitor\r\n  for the personal estates of intestate clerks. In 1246, he issued an\r\n  edict making this demand. Even Henry III. (dependent and ally of Rome\r\n  as he was) protested, and the edict was withdrawn. (See Pollock and\r\n  Maitland, II. 357.)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis chapter of Magna Carta was directed against all such pretensions of\r\nthe Crown or its officials. Whoever else might get these windfalls, King\r\nJohn must not compete. So much is clear; some sort of compromise was,\r\nfurther, made between the two most likely claimants. Magna Carta\r\nprovided for a friendly co-operation between the deceased’s kinsmen and\r\nthe Church in distributing the residue of the intestate’s personal\r\nestate, after satisfying all preferential claims of creditors, wives,\r\nand children. This chapter, although afterwards struck out of all\r\nreissues of the Charter, seems to have been observed in practice.[679]\r\nApparently, however, the right of the kinsfolk to share the control with\r\nthe Church gradually receded into the background, while the Courts\r\nChristian assumed complete authority in all cases of intestacy; so much\r\nso, that churchmen had frequently to be reminded that they were only the\r\ndead man’s administrators, and not entitled to appropriate the goods to\r\ntheir own uses.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 679:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Pollock and Maitland, II. 355. “This clause, though it was\r\n  deliberately withdrawn, seems to have settled the law.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand the motives which, in 1216, led those\r\nresponsible for the government of the young Henry III. to withdraw this\r\nprovision of Magna Carta. The Crown had then need of all the money it\r\ncould get, and so long as the uncertainty of the law allowed a scramble\r\nto take place for the goods of intestates, the king could not be asked\r\nto stand aside with his hands tied by a clause of Magna Carta. He would\r\ntake his chance with the other claimants. It was the Church, however,\r\nand not the Crown, which finally secured the prize.[680]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 680:\r\n\r\n  This chapter should be compared with a corresponding provision in the\r\n  Charter of Liberties granted by Henry I. William Rufus, like John, had\r\n  evidently helped himself freely to the chattels of intestates. Henry\r\n  I. (c. 7) made what seems to be merely a partial renunciation of this\r\n  right: where the deceased had been prevented “by arms or infirmity”\r\n  from making his will, his relations and vassals might distribute his\r\n  goods for him. Are we to infer that Henry reserved the right to seize\r\n  them in all other events? Stephen, in his second or Oxford Charter\r\n  (cf. _supra_, p. 121 and appendix), clearly and unambiguously resigned\r\n  all such rights, as far as the property of churchmen was concerned.\r\n  _Si vero morte preoccupatus fuerit, pro salute anime ejus ecclesie\r\n  consilio eadem fiat distributio._ He also confirmed full rights of\r\n  making wills to churchmen. We have already seen that his successors\r\n  did not observe these provisions. (See _supra_, pp. 383-4, and also\r\n  Pollock and Maitland, 1. 503.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT.\r\n\r\nNullus constabularius, vel alius ballivus noster, capiat blada vel alia\r\ncatalla alicujus, nisi statim inde reddat denarios, aut respectum inde\r\nhabere possit de voluntate venditoris.\r\n\r\n  No constable or other bailiff of ours shall take corn or other\r\n  provisions from any one without immediately tendering money therefor,\r\n  unless he can have postponement thereof by permission of the seller.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis chapter is the first of several which redressed abuses springing\r\nfrom one root, namely, the exercise of the royal right of purveyance by\r\nthe various agents of the local government.\r\n\r\nI. _Purveyance in General._ The Norman and Angevin kings of England were\r\ncompelled by their administrative duties and induced by the pleasures of\r\nthe chase to move their courts constantly from district to district.\r\nDuring these royal progresses the difficulties must have been great of\r\nfinding sufficient food for the enormous retinues surrounding the king\r\nin times of peace, and for his armed levies in time of war. It was to\r\nthe interests of the community as a whole that the work of government\r\nand of national defence should not be brought to a stand-still for want\r\nof supplies. No opposition was made when the king arrogated to himself\r\nthe privilege of appropriating, under fair conditions, such necessaries\r\nas his household might require. Such a right, not unlike that enjoyed in\r\nmodern times by the commander of an army encamped in an enemy’s country,\r\nwas allowed to the kings of England in their own land in times of peace,\r\nand was known as the prerogative of purveyance.[681] Unfortunately, the\r\nconditions under which supplies might be requisitioned were left vague:\r\nthe privilege was therefore subject to constant abuse. In theory it was\r\nalways spoken of as merely a right of pre-emption; the provisions seized\r\nwere to be paid for at the market rate: but practice tended to differ\r\nlamentably from theory. In the absence of a neutral arbitrator to fix\r\nthe value of the goods, the unfortunate seller was often thankful to\r\naccept any pittance offered by royal officials, who might subsequently\r\nindeed charge a higher rate against the Crown. Payment was often\r\nindefinitely delayed or made not in coin but in exchequer tallies, “a\r\nvexatious anticipation of taxation,” since these could only be used in\r\npayment of Crown dues. What was worse, in the hurry of the moment, the\r\nking’s purveyors often omitted the formality of paying altogether.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 681:\r\n\r\n  See Blackstone, _Commentaries_, I. 287, for an often-quoted definition\r\n  of purveyance.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMagna Carta did not abolish purveyance, and placed no restrictions\r\nwhatever upon its use for the legitimate and original purpose of\r\nsupplying the king’s household. Some slight attempt to control its\r\nexercise was made sixty years later in the Statute of Westminster I.;\r\nbut without producing much effect.[682] The grievances connected with\r\npurveyance continued throughout four centuries as a fertile source of\r\nvexation to the people and of friction between parliament and the king.\r\nAn attempt, made by the House of Commons to induce James I. to surrender\r\nthis prerogative for a suitable money grant, ended in failure, with the\r\nabandonment of the abortive treaty known as “the Great Contract.” In the\r\ngeneral re-settlement of the revenue, however, at the Restoration,\r\npurveyance and pre-emption, which had fallen into disuse during the\r\nCommonwealth, were abolished.[683] Yet in the following year a new\r\nstatute[684] virtually revived one branch of the right under essential\r\nmodifications: when royal progresses were necessary in the future,\r\nwarrants might be issued from the Board of Green Cloth, authorizing the\r\nking to use such carts and carriages as he might require, at a fair rate\r\nof hire specified in the Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 682:\r\n\r\n  3 Edward I. c. 32.\r\n\r\nFootnote 683:\r\n\r\n  12 Charles II. c. 24, ss. 11-12.\r\n\r\nFootnote 684:\r\n\r\n  13 Charles II. c. 8.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nII. _Branches of Purveyance restricted by Magna Carta._ A practice\r\ntolerated in spite of its burdensome nature because of its absolute\r\nnecessity, when confined to its original purpose of providing for the\r\nneeds of the king’s household, became intolerable when claimed by every\r\ncastle-warden, sheriff, and local bailiff for his own personal or\r\nofficial needs. The annoyance and hardships inseparable from such\r\narbitrary interference with the rights of private property were thus\r\nincreased tenfold, while ample discretionary authority was vested in a\r\nclass of officials least qualified to use it, unscrupulous foreign\r\nadventurers hired by John to intimidate the native population,\r\nresponsible to no one save the king, and careful never to issue from\r\ntheir strongholds except at the head of their reckless soldiery. The\r\nGreat Charter contained a few moderate provisions for checking the\r\nabuses of purveyance as an instrument of local administration.\r\n\r\n(1) _The provisioning of castles._ Commanders of fortresses were left\r\nperfectly free by Magna Carta to help themselves to such corn and other\r\nsupplies as they deemed necessary for their garrisons. Immediate\r\npayment, however, must be made in current coin (not in exchequer\r\ntallies) for everything they requisitioned, unless the owner, on whom a\r\ncompulsory sale was forced, consented to postpone the date of payment.\r\nThe Charter of 1216 made a slight modification in favour of castellans.\r\nPayment for goods taken from inhabitants of the town where the castle\r\nwas situated might be legally delayed for three weeks, a term extended\r\nin 1217 to forty days. Such relaxation was perhaps necessary to meet the\r\ncase of a warden with an empty purse called on to provide against an\r\nunexpected siege or other emergency; but the peaceful townsmen, over\r\nwhose dwellings the dark walls of a feudal stronghold loomed, would not\r\nprove creditors who pressed unduly for payment. Under Henry’s Charters,\r\nas under that of John, immediate payment had to be tendered to owners of\r\ngoods who lived elsewhere than in this neighbouring town.[685]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 685:\r\n\r\n  The Statute of Westminster I. (3 Edward I. c. 7) enacted “that no\r\n  constable or castellan from henceforth take any prise or like thing of\r\n  any other than of such as be of their town or castle, and that it be\r\n  paid or else agreement made within forty days, if it be not ancient\r\n  prise due to the king, or the castle, or the lord of the castle,” and\r\n  further provided (c. 32) that purveyors taking goods for the king’s\r\n  use, or for a garrison, and appropriating the price received therefor\r\n  from the exchequer, should be liable in double payment and to\r\n  imprisonment during the king’s pleasure.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(2) _The requisitioning of horses and carts._ The provisions of chapter\r\n30, modified in subsequent re-issues, sought to prohibit sheriffs from\r\nexacting compulsory cartage from the property of freemen.\r\n\r\n(3) _The appropriation of timber._ The succeeding chapter confined the\r\nking and his officers to the use of such wood as they could obtain from\r\nthe royal demesnes.[686]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 686:\r\n\r\n  For details, see under cc. 30 and 31.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIII. _Branches of Purveyance not mentioned in Magna Carta._ A wide field\r\nwas left alike for the use and the abuse of this prerogative, after due\r\neffect had been given to these moderate provisions. In addition to the\r\nconstant friction kept up through many centuries by its employment as a\r\nmeans of supplying the wants of the king’s household, two minor aspects\r\nof purveyance came into special prominence in later history.\r\n\r\n(1) _The requisition of forced labour._ Hallam points out that the\r\nking’s rights of pre-emption over such goods as he required were\r\nextended, by analogy, to his subjects’ labour. \"Thus Edward III.\r\nannounces to all sheriffs that William of Walsingham had a commission to\r\ncollect as many painters as might suffice for ‘our works in St.\r\nStephen’s chapel, Westminster, to be at our wages as long as shall be\r\nnecessary’; and to arrest and keep in prison all who should refuse or be\r\nrefractory; and enjoins them to lend their assistance. Windsor Castle\r\nowes its massive magnificence to labourers impressed from every part of\r\nthe kingdom. There is even a commission from Edward IV. to take as many\r\nworkmen in gold as were wanted, and employ them at the king’s cost upon\r\nthe trappings of himself and his household.\"[687] Perhaps, however, such\r\ndemands did not form a branch of purveyance at all, but were merely\r\ninstances of illegal royal encroachments.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 687:\r\n\r\n  Hallam, _Middle Ages_, III. 221.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(2) _Billeting of soldiers in private houses._ This practice, which may\r\nbe considered a branch of purveyance, has always been peculiarly\r\nabhorrent to public opinion in England. It is as old as the reign of\r\nJohn; for when that king visited York in 1201 he complained bitterly\r\nthat the citizens neither came out to meet him nor provided for the\r\nwants of his crossbow-men. His threats and demands for hostages were\r\nwith difficulty turned aside by a money payment of £100.[688] Charles I.\r\nmade an oppressive use of this branch of what seems to have been once a\r\nperfectly legal prerogative, punishing householders who opposed his\r\nunpopular measures by quartering his dissolute soldiery upon them, a\r\npractice branded as illegal by the Petition of Right in 1628.[689]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 688:\r\n\r\n  See _Rotuli de oblatis et finibus_, 119.\r\n\r\nFootnote 689:\r\n\r\n  See 3 Charles I. c. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE.\r\n\r\nNullus constabularius distringat aliquem militem ad dandum denarios pro\r\ncustodia castri, si facere voluerit custodiam illam in propria persona\r\nsua, vel per alium probum hominem, si ipse eam facere non possit propter\r\nracionabilem causam; et si nos duxerimus vel miserimus eum in exercitum,\r\nerit quietus de custodia, secundum quantitatem temporis quo per nos\r\nfuerit in exercitu.\r\n\r\n  No constable shall compel any knight to give money in lieu of\r\n  castle-guard, when he is willing to perform it in his own person, or\r\n  (if he himself cannot do it from any reasonable cause) then by another\r\n  responsible man. Further, if we have led or sent him upon military\r\n  service, he shall be relieved from guard in proportion to the time\r\n  during which he has been on service because of us.\r\n\r\n\r\nCastle-guard, or the liability to serve in the garrison of a royal\r\nfortress, formed part of the feudal obligations of the owners of certain\r\nfreehold estates. This service was sometimes due in lieu of attendance\r\nin the army; more usually the tenant who owed garrison duty owed\r\nknight’s service as well.[690] It was probably this duplication of\r\nduties that prevented castle-guard from hardening into a separate\r\ntenure.[691] The right to enforce these obligations was naturally\r\nentrusted to the constables of the various castles whose duty it was to\r\nkeep their garrisons at their full strength. John, however, preferred to\r\ncommute personal service of castle-guard for money payments (analogous\r\nto the scutage paid in lieu of knight’s service), and to man his feudal\r\ntowers with soldiers of fortune rather than with rebellious Englishmen.\r\nCastellans were, therefore, in the habit of demanding money even from\r\nthose who offered personal service. What was worse, when the freeholder\r\nhad followed John on distant service, he was mulcted in a money payment\r\nbecause he had not stayed at home to perform garrison duty during the\r\nsame period. Both forms of this abuse were absolutely forbidden in 1215.\r\nIn certain circumstances, however, this prohibition would have deprived\r\nthe king of what was equitably due to him. Suppose he had granted two\r\nfiefs to the same tenant—one by simple knight’s service, the other by\r\ncastle-ward. A double holding implied double service; the tenant could\r\nnot in fairness plead that the service of one knight rendered abroad\r\noperated as the full discharge of the services of two knights due from\r\nhis two separate fiefs. Castle-guard must in such a case be performed by\r\nan efficient deputy, or else the usual compensation be paid. The reissue\r\nof 1217 amended John’s Charter to this effect. Service with the army\r\nabroad operated as a discharge of castle-guard at home, but not where\r\nthe tenant owed two services for two distinct fiefs.[692]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 690:\r\n\r\n  See the examples collected in Pollock and Maitland, I. 257. See also\r\n  in _Rotuli de oblatis et finibus_, 107, how in 1200 Ralph de Bradel\r\n  offered John 40 marks and a palfrey to be relieved of “the custody of\r\n  the work of the castle of Grimsby.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 691:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, p. 70.\r\n\r\nFootnote 692:\r\n\r\n  _De feodo pro quo fecit servicium in exercitu._ This variation in the\r\n  charter of 1217 seems to have escaped Dr. Stubbs’ attention. See\r\n  _Select Charters_, 346.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER THIRTY.\r\n\r\nNullus vicecomes, vel ballivus noster, vel aliquis alius, capiat equos\r\nvel carectas alicujus liberi hominis pro cariagio faciendo, nisi de\r\nvoluntate ipsius liberi hominis.\r\n\r\n  No sheriff or bailiff of ours, or any other person, shall take the\r\n  horses or carts of any freeman for transport duty, against the will of\r\n  the said freeman.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Charter here returned to the subject of purveyance, one branch of\r\nwhich it practically abolished, except as affecting villeins. No carts\r\nor horses belonging to a freeman were to be requisitioned by any sheriff\r\nor bailiff for the use of the Crown without the owner’s consent; that is\r\nto say, they could not be requisitioned at all. The clause, however, was\r\ncarefully limited to freemen; the inference is plain, that the horses\r\nand implements of villeins were left at the disposal of the Crown\r\nwithout leave asked or price paid for their use. The relative chapter of\r\nthe reissue of 1216 practically restored this branch of purveyance;\r\nconsent of the owner, even when a freeman, need not be obtained,\r\nprovided hire was paid at the rates sanctioned by ancient custom. Those\r\nrates, however, were definitely stated, namely, 10d. _per diem_ for a\r\ncart with two horses, and 1s. 2d. for one with three.[693] Thus the\r\nprerogative, though restored, was not to be abused.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 693:\r\n\r\n  The rate fixed by 13 Charles II. c. 8, for the hire of carts or\r\n  carriages requisitioned by the king, was 6d. per mile. This hire\r\n  included six oxen, or alternatively two horses and four oxen, to each\r\n  vehicle.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn 1217 it was again slightly restricted in favour of the upper classes.\r\nNo demesne cart of any “parson” (_ecclesiastica persona_), or knight, or\r\nlady, could be requisitioned by the bailiffs. The “demesne” carts were,\r\nof course, those that belonged to the owner of the manor as opposed to\r\nthe carts of the villeins. Here again we have evidence of care to make\r\nit clear, if not that villeins were to have no part or parcel in the\r\nbenefits of the great Charter, at least that their rights, if they had\r\nany, could not stand against the more important rights of the Crown.\r\nYeomen and small freeholders were also left exposed to this annoying\r\nform of interference. Abuses continued. Purveyors would occasionally lay\r\nhands on all available horses and carts in the countryside—far more than\r\nthey required—choosing perhaps the season of harvest or some equally\r\nbusy time. The owners, who urgently required them for their own\r\npurposes, would pay ransom money to regain possession. Edward I. enacted\r\nthat perpetrators of such deeds should be “grievously punished by the\r\nmarshals,” if they were members of his household, and therefore amenable\r\nto the summary jurisdiction of his domestic tribunal, or, if not\r\nmembers, then they should pay treble damages and suffer imprisonment for\r\nforty days.[694]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 694:\r\n\r\n  See 3 Edward I. c. 32.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE.\r\n\r\nNec nos nec ballivi nostri capiemus alienum boscum ad castra, vel alia\r\nagenda nostra, nisi per voluntatem ipsius cujus boscus ille fuerit.\r\n\r\n  Neither we nor our bailiffs shall take, for our castles or for any\r\n  other work of ours, wood which is not ours, against the will of the\r\n  owner of that wood.\r\n\r\n\r\nPurveyance of timber growing elsewhere than on royal estates is here\r\nprohibited in absolute terms. In marked contrast with the limited\r\nrestrictions placed upon other branches of purveyance, this branch is\r\ntaken away, not merely from local officials, but from the king\r\nhimself.[695] There was an obvious reason for greater stringency in this\r\ncase: the king’s own extensive demesne woods furnished timber in\r\nabundance, whether for building purposes or for firewood, leaving him no\r\nexcuse for taking, especially if for nothing, the trees of other people.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 695:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Sir James Ramsay, _Angevin Empire_, p. 476, who considers that\r\n  chapters 28 and 30, in the branches of prerogative with which they\r\n  respectively deal, \"leave the king’s personal right open.\"\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe purveyors of James I., shortly after his accession, transgressed\r\nthis provision of Magna Carta by requisitioning timber for repairing the\r\nfortifications of Calais. A decision against the Crown was given by the\r\nBarons of Exchequer in the second year of James’s reign, and a\r\nproclamation was issued, bearing date 23rd April, 1607, disclaiming any\r\nright to such a prerogative. The guilty purveyors were brought before\r\nthe Star Chamber.[696]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 696:\r\n\r\n  See Coke, _Second Institute_, 36.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO.\r\n\r\nNos non tenebimus terras illorum qui convicti fuerint de felonia, nisi\r\nper unum annum et unum diem, et tunc reddantur terre dominis feodorum.\r\n\r\n  We will not retain beyond one year and one day, the lands of those who\r\n  have been convicted of felony, and the lands shall thereafter be\r\n  handed over to the lords of the fiefs.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _The Crown’s Claim to the Property of Felons._ The Crown had\r\ngradually established certain rights, not too clearly defined, in the\r\nproperty of all criminals formally indicted and sentenced for felony.\r\nJohn, here as elsewhere, took full advantage of the vagueness of the law\r\nto stretch prerogative to its utmost limit. Magna Carta, therefore,\r\nattempted to define the exact boundaries of his rights. The old\r\ncustomary law seems invariably to have given the chattels of a condemned\r\nman to the owner of the court which tried him, and the desire for such\r\nperquisites must have created an unfortunate bias against the accused.\r\nIt was not possible, however, to adopt so simple a rule with regard to\r\nthe real estate of felons, for this was claimed as escheat by the feudal\r\nlord from whom the lands were held. Custom gave the land of a felon to\r\nhis feudal lord, and his chattels to the lord who tried him. The Crown\r\ngradually encroached on the rights of both, claiming the real estate of\r\nfelons, as against mesne lords, and their personal estate, as against\r\nthe lords who had jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n(1) _The felon’s lands._ No difficulty arose when Crown tenants were\r\nconvicted, since there the king was lord of the fief as well as lord\r\nparamount, and claimed the whole lands as escheat. When the condemned\r\nman was the tenant of a mesne lord, however, a conflict of interests\r\noccurred, and here a distinction, which gradually became hard and fast,\r\nwas drawn between treason and felony.[697] Treason was an offence\r\nagainst the person of the sovereign, and it was probably on this ground\r\nthat the king made good his claim to seize as forfeit the entire estate,\r\nreal and personal, of every one condemned to a traitor’s death. With\r\nregard to ordinary felons, what looks like a compromise was arrived at.\r\nThe king secured the right to lay waste the lands in question and to\r\nappropriate everything he could find there during the space of a year\r\nand a day; after which period he was bound to hand over the freehold\r\nthus devastated to the lord who claimed the escheat. Such was the custom\r\nduring the reign of Henry II. as described by Glanvill, who makes it\r\nperfectly clear that before the lands were given up at the expiration of\r\nthe year, the houses were thrown down and the trees rooted up, thus\r\npurging away the taint of crime and enriching the exchequer with the\r\nprice of the timber and building materials.[698] The exercise of this\r\nright of waste inflicted upon the lord of the escheat an amount of\r\ndamage out of all proportion to the benefit it brought to the king. The\r\nlord, when at last he entered into possession of the escheated lands,\r\nfound a desert, not a prosperous manor.[699]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 697:\r\n\r\n  Pollock and Maitland, II. 500, consider that the present chapter had a\r\n  distinct influence in accentuating this twofold classification of\r\n  crimes.\r\n\r\nFootnote 698:\r\n\r\n  Glanvill, VII. c. 17. Cf. Bracton, _folio_ 129, for a graphic\r\n  description of “waste,” which included the destruction of gardens, the\r\n  ploughing up of meadow land, and the uprooting of woods.\r\n\r\nFootnote 699:\r\n\r\n  Is it possible that the origin of “year and waste” can be traced to\r\n  the difficulty of agreeing on a definition of “real” and “personal”\r\n  estate respectively? The Crown would claim everything it could as\r\n  \"chattels\"—a year’s crops and everything above the ground.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCoke has attempted to give a more restricted explanation of the Crown’s\r\nrights in this respect, maintaining that the “year and day” was not an\r\naddition to, but a substitute for, the earlier right of “waste,” that\r\nthe king renounced his barbarous claims in return for the undisputed\r\nenjoyment of the ordinary produce for one year only, and agreed, in\r\nreturn for this, to hand over the land with all buildings and\r\nappurtenances intact.[700] The authorities he cites, however, are\r\ninconclusive, and the weight of evidence on the other side leaves little\r\nroom for doubt. Not only does the phrase “year day _and_ waste” commonly\r\nused, create a strong presumption; but Glanvill’s words in speaking of\r\nthe earlier practice are quite free from ambiguity, while the document\r\nknown as the _Praerogativa Regis_ is equally explicit for a period long\r\nafter Magna Carta.[701] Waste, indeed, was a question of degree, and the\r\nCrown was not likely to be scrupulous in regard to felons’ lands, when\r\nit allowed wanton destruction even of Crown fiefs held in honourable\r\nwardship.[702] A year was by no means too long for a thorough exercise\r\nof the right of waste.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 700:\r\n\r\n  _Second Institute_, p. 36.\r\n\r\nFootnote 701:\r\n\r\n  See Pollock and Maitland, I. 316. “The apocryphal statute\r\n  _praerogativa regis_ which may represent the practice of the earlier\r\n  years of Edward I.” Bracton (_folio_ 129) while stating that the Crown\r\n  claimed both, seems to doubt the legality of the claim.\r\n\r\nFootnote 702:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, pp. 244-6.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWide as were the legal rights of the Crown, John extended them\r\nillegally. When his officers had once obtained a footing in the felon’s\r\nland, they refused to surrender it to the rightful lord after the year\r\nand day had expired. In 1205, Thomas de Aula paid 40 marks and a palfrey\r\nto get what he ought to have had for nothing, namely the lands escheated\r\nto him through his tenant’s felony.[703] Magna Carta prohibited such\r\nabuses for the future; prompt evacuation must henceforth take place when\r\nthe year was over; and this settled the law for centuries.[704] The\r\nCrown long exercised its rights, thus limited, and Henry III. sometimes\r\nsold his “year day and waste,” for considerable sums. Thus, in 1229\r\nGeoffrey of Pomeroy was debited with 20 marks for the Crown’s rights in\r\nthe lands of William de Streete and for his corn and chattels. This sum\r\nwas afterwards discharged, however, on the ground that the king, induced\r\nto change his mind, doubtless by a higher bid, had bestowed these rights\r\non another.[705]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 703:\r\n\r\n  Such at least is the most probable explanation of an entry on the Pipe\r\n  Roll of 6 John (cited Madox, I. 488); although it is possible that\r\n  Thomas only bought in “the year day and waste.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 704:\r\n\r\n  Magna Carta is peculiar in speaking of year and day, without any\r\n  reference to waste. If it meant to abolish “waste” it ought to have\r\n  been more explicit. Later records speak of “_annum et vastum_,” _e.g._\r\n  the _Memoranda_ Roll, 42 Henry III. (cited Madox, I. 315), relates how\r\n  60 marks were due as the price of the “year and waste” of a mill, the\r\n  owner of which had been hanged.\r\n\r\nFootnote 705:\r\n\r\n  _Pipe Roll_, 13 Henry III., cited Madox, I. 347. In Kent, lands held\r\n  in gavelkind were exempt alike from the lord’s escheat and the king’s\r\n  waste, according to the maxim “The father to the bough, the son to the\r\n  plough.” See, _e.g._ _praerogativa regis_, c. 16.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(2) _The felon’s chattels._ From an early date the king enjoyed, like\r\nother owners of courts, the right to the goods of the offenders he\r\ncondemned. When Henry II. reorganized the entire system of criminal\r\njustice, and formulated, in the Assizes of Clarendon and Northampton, a\r\nscheme whereby all grave offenders should be formally indicted, and\r\nthereafter reserved for the coming of his own justices, he established\r\nwhat was practically a royal monopoly of jurisdiction over felons; and\r\nthis logically implied a monopoly over their chattels as well—an\r\ninference confirmed by the express terms of article five of the earlier\r\nAssize. As the list of “pleas of the Crown,” which is in this connection\r\nidentical with the list of “felonies,” grew longer, so this branch of\r\nroyal revenue increased proportionately at the expense of the private\r\nowners of “courts leet.” Even in the ten years between the criminal\r\ncodes of 1166 and 1176, two new offences were added to the list, forgery\r\nand arson. The goods of all outlaws and fugitives from justice likewise\r\nfell to the exchequer—the sheriff who seized them being responsible for\r\ntheir appraised value.[706]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 706:\r\n\r\n  Madox. I. 344-8, cites from the _Pipe Rolls_ many examples.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe magnates in 1215 made no attempt to interfere with this branch of\r\nadministration, tacitly acquiescing in Henry II.’s encroachments on\r\ntheir ancestors’ criminal jurisdictions and perquisites. Under Henry\r\nIII. and Edward I. the forfeited goods of felons continued to form a\r\nvaluable source of revenue. In 1290 the widow of a man who had committed\r\nsuicide, and therefore incurred forfeit as a _felo de se_, bought in his\r\ngoods and chattels for £300, a high price, in addition to which the\r\nCrown specially reserved its “year day and waste.”[707]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 707:\r\n\r\n  This case is cited by Madox, I. 347, from 18 Edward I.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nII. _Indictment, Conviction, and Attainder._ The Crown could not\r\nappropriate the property of men merely suspected of crime, however\r\nstrong might be the presumption of guilt. Mere accusation was not\r\nenough; a formal judgment was required. The Charter refers to the lands\r\nof a “convicted” offender, and conviction must be distinguished from\r\nindictment on the one hand, and from attainder on the other; since these\r\nformed three stages in the procedure for determining guilt.\r\n\r\n(1) _Indictment._ It has already been shown[708] how Henry of Anjou\r\ntried to substitute, wherever possible, indictment by a jury for private\r\nappeal in criminal suits. The Assize of Clarendon authorized such\r\nindictments to be taken before sheriffs, and we learn from Bracton that\r\nimmediately the formal accusation had been made the sheriff became\r\nresponsible for the safety of the accused man’s property, both real and\r\npersonal. With the help of the coroners and of lawful men of the\r\nneighbourhood he must have the chattels appraised and inventoried, and\r\nhold them in suspense until the “trial,” providing therefrom in the\r\ninterval “estovers,” that is, sufficient sustenance for the accused and\r\nhis family.[709]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 708:\r\n\r\n  _Supra_, p. 108.\r\n\r\nFootnote 709:\r\n\r\n  See Bracton, II. _folio_ 123, and _folio_ 137.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIf the prisoner was acquitted or died before conviction, then the lands\r\nand chattels were restored to him or to his relatives, the Crown taking\r\nnothing. Reginald of Cornhill, sheriff of Kent, was discharged in 1201\r\nfrom liability for the appraised value of the goods of a man who, after\r\nindictment for the burning of a house, had died in gaol _non convictus_.\r\nAs the _Pipe Roll_ clearly states, his chattels did not pertain to the\r\nking.[710]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 710:\r\n\r\n  _Pipe Roll_, 2 John, cited Madox, I. 348.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(2) _Conviction._ If the sheriff presided over all preliminary procedure\r\nconnected with indictment, only the justices could “try” the plea, that\r\nis, give sentence according to success or failure in the test appointed\r\nfor the accused man to perform.[711] Prior to 1215 the usual test, in\r\naccordance with the Assize of Clarendon, was the ordeal of water in the\r\nordinary case, or of the red-hot iron in the case of men of high rank,\r\nor of women. If the suspected man failed, sentence was a mere formality;\r\nhe had “convicted” himself of the felony. As a consequence of the\r\ncondemnation of ordeal by the Lateran Council of 1215, the verdict of\r\nguilty pronounced by what was virtually a petty jury, became the normal\r\n“test” which branded an offender as _convictus_. This was long looked on\r\nas an innovation, and accordingly the law refused to compel the accused,\r\nagainst his will, to trust his fate to this new form of trial. He might\r\nrefuse to “put himself upon his country,” and by thus “standing mute,”\r\nas the phrase was, make his own “conviction” impossible, saving himself\r\nfrom punishment and depriving the king of his chattels and “year and\r\nday.” For centuries those responsible shrank from the obvious course of\r\ntreating silence as equivalent to a plea of guilty; but while liberty to\r\nrefuse to submit to a jury’s verdict was theoretically recognized,\r\nbarbarous measures were in reality adopted to compel consent. The\r\nStatute of Westminster in 1275[712] directed that all who refused should\r\nbe imprisoned _en le prison forte et dure_. The object seems to have\r\nbeen to ensure that obstinate offenders should not escape altogether\r\nunpunished, although they saved their property by avoiding a technical\r\nconviction. This statutory authority for strict confinement, however,\r\nwas very liberally interpreted by the agents of the Crown, who treated\r\nit as a legal warrant for revolting cruelties, aimed at compelling the\r\nstubborn to put themselves upon a jury. Food and drink were virtually\r\ndenied to them, a little mouldy bread and a mouthful of impure water\r\nonly being allowed them upon alternate days; and at a later date the\r\nprisoner was slowly crushed to death under great weights “as heavy, yea\r\nheavier than he can bear.” Brave men, guilty, or mayhap innocent, but\r\nsuspicious of a corrupt jury, preferred thus to die in torments, that\r\nthey might save to their wives and children the property which would\r\nupon conviction have fallen to the Crown. The fiction was carefully\r\nmaintained that the victim of such barbarous treatment was not subjected\r\nto “torture,” always illegal at common law, but merely to _peine forte\r\net dure_, a perfectly legal method of persuasion under the Statute of\r\n1275. This procedure was not abolished until 1772; then only was an\r\naccused man for the first time deprived of his right to \"have his\r\nlaw\"—his claim to ordeal as the old method of proving his innocence.\r\nUntil that date then, a jury’s verdict was treated as though it were\r\nstill a new-fangled and unwarranted form of “test” usurping the place of\r\nthe ordeal, although the latter had been virtually abolished early in\r\nthe thirteenth century.[713]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 711:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, c. 24.\r\n\r\nFootnote 712:\r\n\r\n  3 Edward I. c. 12.\r\n\r\nFootnote 713:\r\n\r\n  The Act 12 George III. c. 20, made standing mute equivalent to a plea\r\n  of _guilty_. A later act, 7 and 8 George IV. c. 28, made it equivalent\r\n  to a plea of _not guilty_. See Stephen, _Hist. Crim. Law_, I. 298.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(3) _Attainder._ Coke in commenting on this passage draws a further\r\ndistinction between “conviction” which resulted immediately either from\r\na confession or from a verdict of guilty, and “attainder” which required\r\nin addition a formal sentence by the judge. In his age, apparently, it\r\nwas the sentence of attaint which implied the forfeiture; looking as\r\nusual at Magna Carta through seventeenth-century glasses, he seems\r\nsurprised to find “convicted” used where he would have written\r\n“attainted.” Yet this distinction, if recognized at all in 1215, must\r\nhave been quite immaterial then. It was under the Tudor sovereigns that\r\nthe doctrine of the penal effects of attainder was fully elaborated.\r\nWhen sentence was passed on a felon, a blight as it were fell\r\nimmediately upon him: his blood was henceforth in the eye of the law\r\nimpure, and his kindred could inherit nothing that was his or that came\r\nthrough him. No one could be treated as a blood relation of one whose\r\nentire blood was tainted; and the Crown naturally reaped the\r\nprofit.[714]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 714:\r\n\r\n  This fiction of corrupt blood was apparently based in part on a false\r\n  derivation of the word “attainder.” See _Oxford English Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nA series of statutes of the nineteenth century modified the harshness\r\nwith which this rule bore on the felon’s innocent relations;[715] and\r\nfinally the Forfeiture Act of 1870[716] abolished “corruption of blood”\r\nand deprived the Crown completely of all interest in the estates of\r\nfelons, alike in escheats and in chattels. Thus the word “attainted” has\r\nbecome practically obsolete, and the distinction insisted on by Coke has\r\nceased to have any importance in modern law. A criminal who is\r\nfulfilling the term of his sentence is known, not as a man attainted,\r\nbut simply as a “convict,” the same word as was used in Magna Carta.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 715:\r\n\r\n  _E.g._ 54 George III. c. 145, and 3 and 4 William IV. c. 106, s. 10.\r\n\r\nFootnote 716:\r\n\r\n  33 and 34 Victoria, c. 23.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE.\r\n\r\nOmnes kydelli de cetero deponantur penitus de Tamisia, et de Medewaye,\r\net per totam Angliam, nisi per costeram maris.\r\n\r\n  All kydells for the future shall be removed altogether from Thames and\r\n  Medway, and throughout all England, except upon the sea coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of this provision is open to no reasonable grounds of doubt;\r\nit was intended to remove from rivers all obstacles likely to interfere\r\nwith navigation. The full importance of such a measure can only be\r\nunderstood when the deplorable condition of the few roads which existed\r\nin the Middle Ages is kept in view. The water-ways were the great\r\navenues of commerce; when these were blocked, the townsmen and traders\r\nsuffered loss, while those who depended on them for their necessaries,\r\ncomforts, and luxuries, shared in the general inconvenience. Magna Carta\r\nintervened in the interests of all classes, and demanded the immediate\r\nremoval of obstructions which interrupted inland traffic. Only one class\r\nof impediments indeed was mentioned, “kydells” (or fish-weirs), not\r\nbecause of the purposes to which these were put, but because they were\r\nthe form of obstruction which called for repressive measures at the\r\nmoment. This word, whatever narrower technical meaning it may have borne\r\nin later days, seems to have been used by the framers of Magna Carta in\r\na wide general sense, as applying to all fixed and bulky contrivances or\r\n“engines” intended to catch fish, and likely to interfere with the free\r\npassage of boats.[717]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 717:\r\n\r\n  The _Oxford English Dictionary_ defines it as “a dam, weir, or barrier\r\n  in a river, having an opening in it fitted with nets or other\r\n  appliances for catching fish,” and also as “an arrangement of\r\n  stake-nets on the sea-beach for the same purpose.”\r\n\r\nIt has been gratuitously assumed that the motive for prohibiting these\r\n“kydells” must have been of a similar kind to the motive for\r\nconstructing them; and that therefore the object of the present chapter\r\nwas to prevent the Crown or others from acquiring a monopoly of rights\r\nof fishing to the exclusion of the public. Law courts and writers on\r\njurisprudence for many centuries uniformly endorsed this mistaken view,\r\nand treated Magna Carta as an absolute prohibition of the creation of\r\n“several” (or exclusive) fisheries in tidal waters.[718] Although this\r\nlegal doctrine has been frequently and authoritatively enunciated, it\r\nrests undoubtedly on a historical misconception. The Great Charter\r\nsought to protect freedom of navigation, not freedom of fishing; and\r\nthis is obvious from the last words of the chapter: kydells are to be\r\nremoved from Thames and Medway and throughout all England “_except upon\r\nthe sea-coast_.” It would have been a manifest absurdity to allow the\r\ncreation of monopolies of taking fish in the open seas, while insisting\r\non perfect freedom of fishing in rivers, the banks of which were private\r\nproperty. The sense is quite clear: no objection was taken to “kydells,”\r\nwhatever they might be, so long as they did not interfere with\r\nnavigation.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 718:\r\n\r\n  Blackstone, _Commentaries_, IV. 424, declared that this chapter\r\n  “prohibited for the future the grants of exclusive fisheries.” Cf.\r\n  _e.g._ Thomson, _Magna Charta_, 214, and Norgate, _John Lackland_,\r\n  217. See also Malcolmson _v._ O’Dea (1862), 10 _H. of L. Cas._, 593,\r\n  and Neill _v._ Duke of Devonshire (1882), 8 App. Ca. at p. 179,—cases\r\n  cited in Moore, _History and Law of Fisheries_, p. 13, where the\r\n  fallacy is exposed.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe erroneous view, however, had much to excuse it, and acquired\r\nplausibility from the circumstance that the destruction of obstacles to\r\nthe free passage of boats incidentally secured also free passage for\r\nsalmon and other migratory fish; and that _later_ statutes, when\r\nlegislative motives had become more complicated, were sometimes passed\r\nwith both of these objects in view. The change is well illustrated by a\r\ncomparison of the words of two statutes of 1350 and of 1472\r\nrespectively. The first of these repeats the substance of this chapter\r\nof Magna Carta, and thus explains its object:—“Whereas the common\r\npassage of boats and ships in the great rivers of England be oftentimes\r\nannoyed by the inhancing of gorces, mills, weirs, stanks, stakes, and\r\nkydells.”[719] Here there is no allusion to fish or rights of fishing.\r\nThe later act, while confirming, under penalties, previous statutes for\r\nthe suppression of weirs, not only states its own intention as twofold,\r\nnamely, to protect navigation of rivers, and “also in safeguard of all\r\nthe fry of fish spawned within the same,” but retrospectively and\r\nunwarrantably attributes a like double motive to Magna Carta.[720]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 719:\r\n\r\n  25 Edward III., stat. 3, c. 4.\r\n\r\nFootnote 720:\r\n\r\n  12 Edward IV. c. 7. Apparently the earliest statute which refers to\r\n  weirs as causing injury to fish was one passed in 1402, namely, 4\r\n  Henry IV. c. 11, see Moore, _Fisheries_, p. 175.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSo far as the Thames and Medway were concerned, this provision contained\r\nnothing new. To the Londoners, indeed, the keeping open of their river\r\nfor trade was a matter of vital importance. The right to destroy all\r\n_kydelli_ in the Thames and Medway had been purchased from Richard I.\r\nfor 1500 marks, and a further sum had been paid to John to have this\r\nconfirmed. The charter of Richard I. is dated 14th July, 1197; and that\r\nof John, 17th June, 1199. Each king declared, in words practically\r\nidentical, that Hubert Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury, and others had\r\npointed out “that great detriment and discommodity hath grown to our\r\nsaid city of London, and also to the said realm by occasion of the said\r\nkydells.” Accordingly each charter declared that the king has “granted\r\nand steadfastly commanded that all kydells that are in the Thames be\r\nremoved wheresoever they shall be within the Thames; also we have\r\nquit-claimed all that which the Warden of our Tower of London was wont\r\nyearly to receive from the said kydells. Wherefore we will and\r\nsteadfastly command that no warden of the said Tower, at any time\r\nhereafter, shall exact anything of any one, neither molest nor burden\r\nnor make any demand of any person by reason of the said kydells.” John’s\r\ncharter of 1199 went further than that of Richard, making it clear that\r\nthe prohibition referred to the Medway as well as to the Thames, and\r\ngranting the right to inflict a penalty of £10 upon anyone infringing\r\nits provisions.[721]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 721:\r\n\r\n  It seems to have been generally assumed that these charters conferred\r\n  positive as well as negative privileges on the citizens of London;\r\n  that not merely were obstructions to navigation thereby prohibited in\r\n  their interests, but that wide rights of administration and\r\n  jurisdiction over the waters of the Thames were conferred on the city\r\n  authorities (rights which previous to 1197 had been exercised, it is\r\n  assumed, by the Constable of the Tower of London). See Noorthouck,\r\n  _New History of London_ (1773) p. 36, and Luffman, _Charters of\r\n  London_ (1793) p. 13. The latter says of Richard’s grant in 1197: “By\r\n  this charter the citizens became conservators of the river Thames.”\r\n  The _Patent Rolls_ of 33 Edward I.; 5 Edward III.; 8 Edward III.,\r\n  _etc._; contain Commissions of Conservancy. See Moore, _ibid._, p.\r\n  176. In 1393 the statute of 17 Richard II. c. 9 granted authority to\r\n  the Mayor of London to regulate weirs likely to destroy fish, and\r\n  generally to “conserve” the Thames from Staines downwards, along with\r\n  the Medway.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMagna Carta merely confirmed, and extended to all rivers, a prohibition\r\nalready secured by the Londoners specially for their own river. The\r\nprovision was repeated in the reissues of Henry III. The citizens,\r\nhowever, did not rest content with a clause in a general enactment, but\r\npurchased for 5000 marks three new charters exclusively in their own\r\nfavour. One of these, dealing with kydells in Thames and Medway, was\r\nissued by Henry on 18th February, 1227, in terms almost identical with\r\nthose of Richard and John.[722]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 722:\r\n\r\n  See _Rotuli Cartarum_, under the year 11 Henry III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR.\r\n\r\nBreve quod vocatur _Precipe_ de cetero non fiat alicui de aliquo\r\ntenemento unde liber homo amittere possit curiam suam.\r\n\r\n  The writ which is called _praecipe_ shall not for the future be issued\r\n  to anyone, concerning any tenement whereby a freeman may lose his\r\n  court.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn extorting from John a solemn promise to restrict the use of the\r\nparticular writ here referred to, the barons gained something of\r\ninfinitely greater value than a petty reform of court procedure; they\r\ncommitted their enemy to a complete reversal of a line of policy\r\nvigorously and consistently pursued for at least half a century. The\r\nprocess by which the jurisdiction of the king’s courts was steadily\r\nundermining that of the feudal courts was now to be suddenly arrested.\r\nMagna Carta by this apparently inoffensive clause was grappling in\r\nreality with an urgent political problem of the day, fraught with\r\ntremendous practical issues alike for king and barons. This can only be\r\nunderstood in connection with the technical details on which it hinges.\r\n\r\nI. _Royal Writs and the Feudal Jurisdictions._ The class of writs,\r\ncalled from their initial word “Writs _praecipe_,” was a large one, and\r\nfreely used by the Crown for issuing peremptory orders of various kinds\r\nto its officers and others. This provision of Magna Carta had special\r\nreference to one type of these writs only, the so-called _praecipe quod\r\nreddat_.[723] These were intended to inaugurate, before the king’s\r\njustices, pleas for determining the ownership of property either by\r\nbattle or by grand assize—preferably the latter. They were called “Writs\r\nof Right,” because they treated of questions of title, not merely\r\nquestions of possession.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 723:\r\n\r\n  The numerous varieties of writs _praecipe_ are arranged by Coke\r\n  (_Second Institute_, p. 40) in three groups, according to the nature\r\n  of the orders they were intended to convey, viz.:—(a) _praecipe quod\r\n  reddat_; (b) _quod permittat_; and (c) _quod faciat_. Those specially\r\n  referred to in this chapter are of the first type.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe form of a _praecipe quod reddat_, as actually issued from the\r\nChancery of Henry II. (who invented it), is given by Glanvill, and its\r\nterms illustrate the insidious methods by which the Crown encroached on\r\nfeudal jurisdictions.[724] The writ was directed to the sheriff, and\r\nbegan bluntly:—“Command” (_praecipe_) A. “to give back” (_quod reddat_)\r\nto B. a piece of ground there specified, or alternatively, “to explain\r\nwhy he had not done so” (_ostensurus quare non fecerit_). The real\r\nobject does not, however, appear upon the surface. It was by no means\r\nintended that the man to whom the command was issued, should abandon his\r\nclaim without discussion. He would naturally take the alternative\r\nallowed him, namely, appear before the king’s justices and there “show\r\ncause” why he had not obeyed the order, by proving (if he could) a\r\nbetter title to the property in dispute than that alleged by the rival\r\nclaimant. The writ, which on the surface reads merely as a summary and\r\nfinal command to hand over the estate to another, is really an “original\r\nwrit” commencing a litigation in the king’s court. One important effect\r\nof its issue was that all proceedings instituted in inferior tribunals\r\nmust immediately stop.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 724:\r\n\r\n  The writ ran as follows:—_Rex vicecomiti salutem, Praecipe A. quod\r\n  sine dilatione reddat B. unam hidam terrae in villa illa, unde idem B.\r\n  queritur quod praedictus A. ei deforceat: et nisi fecerit, summone eum\r\n  per bonos summonitores quod sit ibi coram me vel Justiciariis meis in\r\n  crastino post octabas clausi Paschae apud locum illum, ostensurus\r\n  quare non fecerit. Et habeas ibi summonitores et hoc breve. Teste\r\n  Ranulpho de Glanvilla apud Clarendon._ See Glanvill, I. c. 6.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe feudal lord, in whose court baron the plea would naturally have been\r\ndecided, was thus robbed by the king of his jurisdiction. With it, he\r\nlost also authority over his tenants, and numerous fees and perquisites.\r\nThe writ _praecipe_ was thus mainly an ingenious device for “evoking” a\r\nparticular cause from the manorial court to the king’s court.[725]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 725:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, I. 576.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHenry II., in inventing or systematizing the legal procedure known as\r\n“the writ process,” because its leading feature was that it forbade any\r\naction to be begun without a royal writ, had two objects in view. While\r\nreforming by its instrumentality the entire administration of justice in\r\nEngland, the king hoped by the same means, to destroy gradually the\r\nfeudal privileges of his magnates. He intended, step by step, to draw\r\ninto his own courts all pleas relating to land. Questions of property\r\nwere to be tried before his justices, by combat or, at the defendant’s\r\noption, by the grand assize; questions of possession (without any\r\noption) by the appropriate petty assize. The barons showed no desire to\r\ndispute the Crown’s assumption of a monopoly over the petty assizes;\r\nindeed they cordially acquiesced in this by the terms of chapter 18 of\r\nthe Charter. The grand assize was another matter; they refused to be\r\nrobbed of their right to determine, in their own courts baron,\r\nproprietary actions between their own tenants. Indeed, for such\r\nwholesale extension of the king’s jurisdiction over pleas of land, Henry\r\nII. had absolutely no precedent. He had made the Crown strong and then\r\nused its power for his own aggrandizement. The king’s courts had\r\nincreased their authority, as a distinguished American historian has\r\nexpressed it, “by direct usurpation, in derogation of the rights of the\r\npopular courts and manorial franchises, upon the sole authority of the\r\nking.”[726]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 726:\r\n\r\n  See Bigelow, _Hist. of Procedure_, 78. Glanvill, read between the\r\n  lines, contains admissions which support this view. Friend of\r\n  prerogative as he was, he shows consciousness of a distinction between\r\n  the proper and improper use of the royal jurisdiction. Thus in I. c.\r\n  3, he speaks of the king’s courts as normally dealing with “pleas of\r\n  baronies” (_i.e._ litigations concerning Crown fiefs); in I. c. 5, he\r\n  speaks of what he evidently considers an abnormal expansion of this\r\n  jurisdiction to any plea anent a free tenement or fief, if the Crown\r\n  so desired,—that is, the Crown claimed an option, in circumstances\r\n  admitted to be abnormal, of deciding pleas as to fiefs held under\r\n  mesne lords. This distinction is identical with that on which the\r\n  present chapter of Magna Carta is based.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNow, the chief instrument devised by Henry for effecting such\r\nusurpations was precisely this particular form of the writ _praecipe_\r\n(or Writ of Right).[727] Tenants whose titles were challenged gladly\r\npurchased such writs, as the only way to escape trial by combat; and\r\nJohn frequently issued them to the prejudice of feudal lords, whose\r\njurisdiction was thus curtailed. The barons in 1215 considered this a\r\ngrievance; and Magna Carta in demanding its redress deliberately\r\nattempted to arrest the process of royal usurpation. The tide must be\r\nturned back; the system of feudal justice, now fast becoming obsolete,\r\nmust in its entirety be revived. Each freeman or baron must be left\r\nwithout competition as the sole source of justice to his own tenants in\r\nall pleas of land, unmolested by these new-fangled writs of right. It\r\nwas not intended, of course, to abolish completely the extensive and\r\nuseful class of writs _praecipe_; but merely to prevent the Crown using\r\nthem as an engine of encroachment upon manorial jurisdictions.[728] The\r\nking might keep his own court and issue writs to his own tenants; but\r\nlet him respect the courts of others. For the future, such writs must\r\nnot be issued “concerning any tenement whereby a freeman may lose his\r\ncourt.” Writs _praecipe_ might be freely used for any other purpose, but\r\nnot for this. This one purpose, however, was exactly what had specially\r\nrecommended it to the great king who had invented it.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 727:\r\n\r\n  The normal procedure seems to have included the following steps: (_a_)\r\n  a claimant in the court of the lord of the fief offers to prove by\r\n  battle a better title than the tenant in possession; (_b_) the tenant\r\n  applies to the king to have the issue decided by grand assize; (_c_) a\r\n  writ _praecipe quod reddat_ is then issued in the form given by\r\n  Glanvill, I. c. 6, (already cited) virtually forbidding the claimant\r\n  to proceed elsewhere than before the king; (_d_) a second writ follows\r\n  in the form given by Glanvill, II. c. 8, forbidding the lord “to hold\r\n  in his court the plea between the litigants M. and R. because M. the\r\n  tenant has put himself upon my assize.” Cf. _supra_, c. 18.\r\n\r\nFootnote 728:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Bracton, folio 281. See also Bracton’s _Note Book_, case 1215,\r\n  where a certain writ _praecipe_ was held not to be struck at by Magna\r\n  Carta, since it did not take any man’s court away.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe present chapter must, therefore, be regarded as containing one of\r\nthe most reactionary provisions of the entire Charter. The barons had,\r\nat last, succeeded in compelling John to promise a complete reversal of\r\na central part of the deliberate policy of his father.\r\n\r\nHere, then, under the guise of a small change in legal procedure, was\r\nconcealed a notable triumph of feudalism over the centralizing policy of\r\nthe monarchy—a backward step, which, if given full effect to, might have\r\nushered in a second era of feudal turbulence such as had disgraced the\r\nreign of Stephen. We are told on high authority that John’s\r\nacknowledgment of \"the claims of the feudal lord to hold a court which\r\nshall enjoy an exclusive competence in proprietary actions\"—was one\r\nwhich “Henry II. would hardly have been forced into.”[729] That may well\r\nbe; but John had already more than once rejected this proposal with\r\nviolence. In 1215, he could no longer strive against the inevitable, and\r\nagreed under compulsion to provisions which he had no intention to keep.\r\nThe concession, although insincere, was nevertheless an important one.\r\nThe substance of chapter 34 was repeated with some trivial verbal\r\nalterations in all future issues of Magna Carta.[730]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 729:\r\n\r\n  Pollock and Maitland, I 151.\r\n\r\nFootnote 730:\r\n\r\n  The version of 1216 speaks of a “free tenement,” where that of 1215\r\n  spoke merely of a “tenement.” The addition makes no change, since in\r\n  no case could the king’s courts try pleas affecting the villeins of\r\n  mesne lords. Perhaps the object of the addition is to make it clear\r\n  that there was no interference with the king’s rights over the\r\n  holdings of his own villeins on royal demesne.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nII. _Influence of this Provision on later Legal Development._ One\r\nimportant question still remains: Was this provision observed in\r\npractice? The answer is partly Yes, but chiefly No. Its letter was\r\nstringently enforced; but its spirit was evaded. (1) The Chancery, in\r\nobedience to Magna Carta, ceased to issue this particular form of writ\r\nin such a manner as to cause a freeman “to lose his court.” It was still\r\nissued to Crown tenants; but strictly denied to all under-tenants, who\r\nwere thus left to find redress at the feudal court of the magnate from\r\nwhom they held their land.[731] The measure thus forced on the Crown in\r\nthe selfish interests of the baronage inflicted hardship on tenants of\r\nmesne lords, in whose faces the doors of the king’s tribunals, opened to\r\nthem by Henry II., were once more closed in all pleas touching their\r\nfreeholds. In such cases the court baron of their lord was now their\r\nonly source of justice, and in that court they could not get the benefit\r\nof the improved methods of royal procedure. In particular, the grand\r\nassize was a royal monopoly. The magnates, indeed, desired to adopt it,\r\nbut this was rendered difficult by an obstacle which the Crown made the\r\nmost of.[732] They had difficulty in getting together twelve knights\r\nwilling to act as jurors; and they could not force them to give a sworn\r\nverdict against their will. The king might compel; but a mesne lord\r\ncould only persuade. Men of the required status objected to the waste of\r\ntime, and dreaded the danger of being punished for false verdicts,\r\ninseparable from the duty of serving on a grand assize. Whatever hopes\r\nthe barons may have entertained of overcoming such difficulties were\r\ndisappointed. In 1259 the Provisions of Westminster declared that\r\nfreeholders should not be compelled to swear against their will \"since\r\nno one can make them do this without the King’s warrant.\"[733] It was\r\nthe deliberate policy of Edward I. to exaggerate all such difficulties,\r\nputting every obstacle in the way of private courts, until he reduced\r\ntheir jurisdictions to sinecures.[734]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 731:\r\n\r\n  The writs, thus restricted so that only tenants _in capite_ could\r\n  obtain them, were thereafter known as writs _praecipe in capite_.\r\n  Under that name the writ appears in Coke’s version of the charter of\r\n  Henry III. (_Second Institute_, p. 38), and in the translation given\r\n  in the _Statutes at Large_ of the reissue of 1225. There is no\r\n  authority in any text of Magna Carta for the addition of the words _in\r\n  capite_, and the explanation of their presence in these versions must\r\n  be sought in the tendency of lawyers in an age long subsequent to 1215\r\n  to re-edit Magna Carta in the technical language of their own day.\r\n  Coke emphasised the restriction of this remedy to Crown tenants. “No\r\n  man ought to have this writ out of the Chancery upon a suggestion, but\r\n  oath must be made, before the granting thereof, that the land is\r\n  holden of the king _in capite_,” (p. 38), and he illustrates what he\r\n  says by reference to two cases drawn from the reign of Edward I.\r\n\r\nFootnote 732:\r\n\r\n  Such an attempt seems to have been made in 1207 by Walter de Lacy,\r\n  Earl of Ulster, who set up in his Irish fief what is described as\r\n  _nova assisa_, against which John protested. See _Rot. Pat._, I. 72,\r\n  for writ dated 23rd May, 1207. In one case at least, exceptional it is\r\n  true, John acquiesced in grand assizes being held in feudal courts. On\r\n  4th May, 1201, he granted licence to Hubert Walter (and his\r\n  successors) to hold them for his tenants in gavelkind, a tenure\r\n  peculiar to Kent. See _New Rymer_, I. 83.\r\n\r\nFootnote 733:\r\n\r\n  See article 18 (_Select Charters_, p. 404). Other articles show a\r\n  similar strong bias against seignorial justice. Cf. chapter 29 of the\r\n  Petition of the Barons (_Select Charters_, 386), and the comment of\r\n  Pollock and Maitland, I. 182: “The voice of the nation, or what made\r\n  itself heard as such, no longer, as in 1215, demanded protection for\r\n  the seignorial courts.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 734:\r\n\r\n  There was, however, a partially successful attempt made to revive\r\n  feudal jurisdictions as late as the reign of Edward III. See Stubbs,\r\n  _Const. Hist._, II. 638-9.\r\n\r\n(2) While the letter of Magna Carta was strictly kept, its spirit was\r\nevaded. It was impossible to give loyal effect to an enactment which\r\nwent directly counter to the whole stream of progress. Manorial justice\r\nwas falling fast into disrepute and abeyance, while royal justice was\r\nbecoming more efficient and more popular, and was soon to rid itself of\r\nall competitors and obtain a monopoly. Under-tenants, deprived of access\r\nto the king’s court by the direct road of the writ _praecipe_, sought\r\nother and more tortuous modes of entrance. Legal fictions were devised.\r\nThe great problem was how to evade Magna Carta without openly infringing\r\nit. The king’s justices and would-be litigants in the king’s courts\r\nformed a tacit alliance for this end, but had to proceed by slow and\r\nwary steps, in the teeth of bitter opposition from the powerful owners\r\nof seignorial courts. The process adopted consisted of a series of\r\nformal changes in the technical procedure of the king’s courts. Its key\r\nlies in the ingenious original (or originating) writs invented by Crown\r\nlawyers, which really effected one thing while professing to effect\r\nsomething quite different. These new writs were known as writs of entry\r\nand came half-way between writs of right (or writs _praecipe_) and the\r\npetty assizes; half-way between writs commencing actions dealing with\r\ntitle (and therefore attacked by chapter 34 of Magna Carta) and writs\r\ndealing with possession (and therefore welcomed by chapter 18). Writs of\r\nentry were thus, from the point of view of the magnate with his private\r\ncourt, wolves in sheep’s clothing. They professed to determine a\r\nquestion of _possession_, but really decided a question of _ownership_.\r\nAt first the pleas to which they could be applied were few and special.\r\nSteadily new forms of action were devised to cover almost every\r\nconceivable case. The process of evolution was a long one, commencing\r\nsoon after 1215, and virtually concluding with chapter 29 of the Statute\r\nof Marlborough, or rather with the liberal construction which Crown\r\nlawyers placed upon that statute in the following reign.\r\n\r\nEdward I., at the height of his power, and eager to set his house in\r\norder, shrank from an open breach of the Great Charter, gladly adopting\r\nsubtle expedients to cheat mesne lords out of the rights secured to them\r\nby the present chapter. In Edward’s reign, then, the legal machinery\r\ninvented for this purpose was brought to perfection, so that thereafter\r\nno action relating to freehold was ever again tried in the courts baron\r\nof the magnates. All such pleas were, in direct violation of the spirit\r\nof Magna Carta, decided in the courts of the king.[735]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 735:\r\n\r\n  Technical details are admirably given by Pollock and Maitland, II.\r\n  63-7. The whole family of writs were known as “writs of entry _sur\r\n  disseisin_”; and these were applied to still wider uses after 1267 on\r\n  the authority of the Statute of Marlborough, as “writs of entry _sur\r\n  disseisin_ on the _post_.” See also Maitland, Preface to _Sel. Pleas\r\n  in Manorial Courts_, p. lv.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe claimant, then, had no need to infringe the prohibition against the\r\nwrit _praecipe_ when he could obtain another writ, equally effective,\r\nunder a different name. A writ of entry was, indeed, to a peaceable\r\nplaintiff, infinitely preferable to a writ _praecipe_, which could only\r\nbe issued to one prepared to _offer_ battle, the option of accepting\r\nlying with his adversary. Crown tenants, even, who could obtain the writ\r\n_praecipe_, came to prefer the more modern substitute; and clause 34 of\r\nMagna Carta was thereafter virtually obsolete.\r\n\r\nOne of the indirect effects of the clause was of a most unfortunate\r\nnature. The necessity it created for effecting reforms by a tortuous\r\npath did great and lasting harm to the form of English law. Legal\r\nfictions have indeed their uses, by evading technical rules of law in\r\nthe interests of substantial justice. The price paid for this relief,\r\nhowever, is usually a heavy one. Complicated procedures and underhand\r\nexpedients have to be invented, and these lead in turn to new legal\r\ntechnicalities of a more irrational nature than the old ones. It would\r\nhave been better in the interests of scientific jurisprudence if so\r\ndesirable a result could have been effected in a more straightforward\r\nmanner. The authors of Magna Carta must bear the blame.[736]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 736:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Pollock and Maitland, I. 151, and _Sel.

It showed, on the one hand, a\r\npraiseworthy desire to set up definite standards of weights and\r\nmeasures, uniform throughout all parts of England. It strove thus to\r\novercome the serious inconvenience experienced by traders, who met with\r\nvarying standards as they moved with their wares from place to place.\r\nWhat was of more importance, the assize sought to obviate also the\r\nfrauds frequently perpetrated upon buyers by unscrupulous merchants\r\nunder the shelter of ambiguous weights and measures. The London quarter\r\nmust, therefore be used everywhere for corn; and one measure for wine or\r\nbeer. So far good. On the other hand, the ordinance of Richard went much\r\nfurther than modern ideas of _laissez faire_ would tolerate. In\r\nparticular, legitimate freedom of trade was interfered with by the cloth\r\nregulations reported by Roger of Hoveden.[737] No cloth, he tells us,\r\nwas to be woven except of a uniform width, namely, “two ells within the\r\nlists.”[738]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 737:\r\n\r\n  R. Hoveden, IV. 33-4.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 738:\r\n\r\n  At a later date cloth of an alternative standard width was also\r\n  legalized, viz., of one yard between the “lists.” Hence arose the\r\n  distinction between “broadcloth” (that is, cloth of two yards) and\r\n  “streits” (that is, narrow cloth of one yard). (See Statute I Richard\r\n  III. c. 8.) The word “broadcloth” has, long since, changed its\r\n  meaning, and now denotes material of superior quality, quite\r\n  irrespective of width. See _Oxford English Dictionary_, under\r\n  “Broadcloth.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nDyed cloths, it was provided, should be of equal quality through and\r\nthrough, as well in the middle as at the outside. Merchants were\r\nprohibited from darkening their windows by hanging up, to quote the\r\nquaint language of the ordinance, “cloth whether red or black, or\r\nshields (_scuta_) so as to deceive the sight of buyers seeking to choose\r\ngood cloth.” Coloured cloth was only to be sold in cities or important\r\nboroughs. Here we have, apparently, a sumptuary law meant to ensure that\r\nthe lower classes went in modest grey attire. Six lawful men were to be\r\nassigned to keep the Assize in each county and each important borough.\r\nThese custodians of measures must see that no goods were bought or sold\r\nexcept according to the standards; imprison those found guilty of using\r\nother measures, whether by their own admission or by failure in the\r\nordeal (_confessus vel convictus_); and seize the chattels of defaulters\r\nfor the king’s behoof. If the _custodes_ performed their duties\r\nnegligently they were to suffer amercement of their chattels.[739]\r\nRichard’s Assize of Measures was supplemented in 1199 by John’s Assize\r\nof Wine, which tried to regulate the price of wines of various\r\nqualities,[740] an attempt not repeated in Magna Carta.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 739:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, c. 20, for “amercements,” and _supra_, c. 24, for\r\n  “custodes” of pleas (or coroners).\r\n\r\nFootnote 740:\r\n\r\n  See R. Hoveden, IV. 100.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe same author who gives us the text of the ordinance of 1197 tells us\r\nalso that its terms were found to be too stringent, and had to be\r\nfrequently relaxed in practice.[741] This was done in 1201. The king’s\r\njustices, we are told, wished to seize the cloth of certain merchants on\r\nthe ground that it was less than the legal width. They compromised,\r\nhowever, by accepting a great sum of money “to the use of the king and\r\nto the damage of many.” Thus Hoveden denounces what he regards as an\r\nunlawful bargain between the justices and the traders for injuring\r\nbuyers by evading the strict letter of the ordinance.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 741:\r\n\r\n  See Hoveden, IV. 172, and Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, I. 616.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMany examples of evasion may be found in the _Pipe Rolls_ both before\r\nand after Magna Carta. The justices, indeed, were usually more bent on\r\ncollecting fines for its breach than on enforcing the Assize. In 1203\r\ntwo merchants of Worksop were amerced each in half a mark for selling\r\nwine contrary to the Assize, while the custodians of measures of the\r\nborough were also mulcted in one mark for performing their duty\r\nnegligently—an exact illustration of the words of the ordinance.[742] In\r\nthe same year a fine of one mark was imposed on certain merchants “for\r\nstretching cloth,” in order, presumably, to bring it to the legal\r\nwidth.[743] Merchants frequently paid heavy fines to escape the\r\nordinance altogether.[744]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 742:\r\n\r\n  See _Pipe Roll_, 4 John, cited Madox, I. 566.\r\n\r\nFootnote 743:\r\n\r\n  See _Ibid._\r\n\r\nFootnote 744:\r\n\r\n  In 1203 the men of Worcester paid 100s. “_ut possint emere et vendere\r\n  pannos tinctos sicut solebant tempore Regis Henrici_”; and the men of\r\n  Bedford, Beverley, Norwich and other towns made similar payments. See\r\n  _Pipe Roll_, 4 John, cited Madox, I. 468-9.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhen the barons in 1215 insisted upon John enforcing his brother’s\r\nordinance in all its rigour, they took a step in their own interests as\r\nbuyers, and against the interests of the trade guilds as sellers.\r\nAlthough this provision was repeated in all subsequent charters, it\r\nseems never to have produced much effect. The difficulty of enforcing\r\nsuch provisions in their strictness was great, and evasion continued.\r\nOne example may suffice. In the second year of Henry III.[745] the\r\ncitizens of London paid 40 marks that they might not be questioned for\r\nselling cloth less than two yards in width. Here is an illustration of\r\nthe practice of the judges to which Hoveden had objected, and which\r\nMagna Carta had apparently failed to put down. Sometimes, however, the\r\nprovisions of Richard’s Assize of Measures and of John’s Assize of Wine\r\nwere still enforced. In 1219 a Lincolnshire parson, with a liberal\r\nconception of the scope of his parochial duties, had to pay 40s. for\r\nwine sold _extra Assisam_.[746] Parsons, apparently, might engage in\r\ntrade, but only if they conformed to the usual regulations.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 745:\r\n\r\n  See _Pipe Roll_, cited Madox, I. 509.\r\n\r\nFootnote 746:\r\n\r\n  _Pipe Roll_, 3 Henry III., cited Madox, I. 567.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX.\r\n\r\nNichil detur vel capiatur de cetero pro brevi inquisicionis de vita vel\r\nmembris, sed gratis concedatur et non negetur.\r\n\r\n  Nothing in future shall be given or taken for a writ of inquisition of\r\n  life or limbs, but freely it shall be granted, and never denied.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis chapter has an important bearing upon trial by combat, and none at\r\nall upon _habeas corpus_, to which it is often supposed to be closely\r\nrelated. The particular writ upon which such emphasis is here laid had\r\nbeen invented by Henry II. to obviate the judicial duel in certain\r\ncases, by allowing the accused man virtually to refer the question of\r\nhis guilt or innocence to the sworn verdict of his neighbours.\r\n\r\nI. _Trial by Combat prior to the Reign of John._ The crucial moment in\r\njudicial proceedings during the Middle Ages arrived, as has already been\r\nexplained,[747] when the “test” or “trial” (_lex_) appointed by the\r\ncourt was attempted by one or both of the litigants. The particular form\r\nof proof to which the warlike Norman barons were attached was the\r\n_duellum_, and it was only natural that such of the old Anglo-Saxon\r\naristocracy as associated with them on terms of equality should adopt\r\ntheir prejudices. Hence “combat” became the normal mode of deciding all\r\nserious disputes among the upper classes. Even from the first, however,\r\nit seems not to have been competent for property of less than 10s. in\r\nvalue,[748] and it soon came to be specially reserved for two classes of\r\ndisputes—civil pleas instituted by writ of right, and criminal pleas\r\nfollowing on “appeal.” The present chapter is concerned with the latter\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 747:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, pp. 103-6.\r\n\r\nFootnote 748:\r\n\r\n  See _Leges Henrici primi_, c. 69, §§ 15-16.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAn “appeal” in this connection was entirely different from the modern\r\nappeal from a lower to a higher court. It was a formal accusation of\r\ntreason or felony made by a private individual on his own initiative,\r\nand was usually followed by judicial combat between the appellant and\r\nappellee, each of whom fought in person. Such a right was necessary in\r\nan age when the government had not yet assumed a general responsibility\r\nfor bringing ordinary criminals to justice, or was at least so lax and\r\nspasmodic in performing that function as to leave many wrongdoers\r\nunpunished. Appeal followed by battle was probably in its origin a form\r\nof legal procedure substituted for the older blood-feud.[749] Those who\r\nhad suffered wrong would be more readily dissuaded from their vendetta\r\nif they were allowed instead the right of judicial duel under fair\r\nconditions laid down by the court. The Norman trial by combat was thus a\r\nsurvival from an earlier stage of society when the wronged person, not\r\nthe magistrate, had been the avenger of crime; and this explains several\r\npeculiarities—why, for example, when the accused had uttered “that\r\nhateful word craven,”[750] thus confessing himself vanquished and\r\ndeserving a perjurer’s fate, the victorious accuser was entitled to his\r\nvengeance, even in the face of a royal pardon. When Henry of Essex,\r\nconstable and standard-bearer of Henry II., accused by his enemy, Robert\r\nde Montfort, in 1163, had been worsted in the combat, the royal favour\r\ncould not shield him, though apparently the king’s connivance enabled\r\nhim, by renouncing his possessions and becoming a monk, and therefore\r\ndead in law, to escape actual death by hanging.[751] It would seem that\r\nat an early date the whole procedure had resembled even more closely a\r\nlegalized private revenge, since the appellant who had vanquished his\r\nfoe was allowed personally to put him to death. \"The ancient usage was,\r\nso late as Henry IV.’s time, that all the relations of the slain should\r\ndrag the appellee to the place of execution.\"[752]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 749:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, c. 20.\r\n\r\nFootnote 750:\r\n\r\n  “_Illud verbum odiosum quod recreantus sit._” Bracton, _folio_ 153.\r\n\r\nFootnote 751:\r\n\r\n  See Jocelyn of Brakelond, pp. 50-2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 752:\r\n\r\n  Blackstone, _Commentaries_, IV. 316.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe evils of trial by combat are obvious. From the first it was dreaded\r\nand avoided by the traders of the boroughs, who paid heavily for\r\ncharters of exemption. Their aversion spread to the higher classes, and\r\nwas shared by Henry II. To that great statesman, endowed with the ardent\r\ninstincts of a reformer, despising utterly all obsolete and irrational\r\nmodes of procedure, and quite devoid of reverence for tradition, trial\r\nby combat was entirely abhorrent. He would gladly have abolished it out\r\nand out if he had dared; but he prudently followed the more subtle\r\npolicy of slowly undermining its vitality. For this purpose he used four\r\nexpedients, which are of great interest in respect that they throw light\r\non the process by which trial by jury superseded trial by battle.[753]\r\n(1) Every facility was afforded the parties to a civil suit who were\r\nwilling to forego the _duellum_ voluntarily. Henry placed at their\r\ndisposal, as a substitute, a procedure which had by his ancestors been\r\nspecially reserved for the service of the Crown. Litigants might refer\r\ntheir rival claims to the oath of a picked body of local neighbours: the\r\nold recognitors thus developed into the _jurata_. This course was\r\npossible, however, only where both parties consented, and it had many\r\nfeatures in common with a modern arbitration. (2) In pleas relating to\r\nthe title and possession of land Henry went further, granting to the\r\ndefendant the option of a peaceful settlement even when the claimant\r\npreferred battle. The men to whose oaths such cases were referred were\r\nknown as an _assisa_, not a _jurata_, since both litigants had not\r\nconsented. The three various groups of assizes welcomed by the barons in\r\nchapter 18 have already been discussed. The _assisa_, like the _jurata_,\r\ncould be applied only to civil pleas. (3) Attempts were made to\r\ndiscourage trial by combat in criminal pleas also by discouraging the\r\nexercise of the right of private “appeal,” its natural prelude. The\r\ncorporate voice of the accusing jury was made as far as possible to\r\nsupersede the individual complaint of the injured party offering battle.\r\nOnly the near blood relation, or the liege lord, of a murdered man was\r\nallowed to prove the offender’s guilt by combat; while a woman’s right\r\nof appeal was kept within narrow limits.[754] (4) A wide field was still\r\nleft for private appeal and battle; but Henry endeavoured to narrow it\r\nby a subtle device. In appeals of homicide, where the accusation was not\r\nmade _bona fide_, but maliciously or without probable cause, the\r\nappellee was afforded a means of escaping the _duellum_. He might apply\r\nfor the writ which forms the subject of this chapter.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 753:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, 107–9, and also 158-163.\r\n\r\nFootnote 754:\r\n\r\n  Some particulars are given under c. 54.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nII. _The Writ of Life and Limb._ The writ here referred to, better known\r\nto medieval England as the writ _de odio et atia_,[755] was intended to\r\nprotect from duel men unjustly appealed of homicide. Rash or malicious\r\naccusations might be raised by turbulent knights, who made fighting\r\ntheir pastime, in order to gratify a grudge against traders or other men\r\nof peace, and many an appealed man was glad to purchase from the king\r\npermission to escape by assuming the habit and tonsure of a monk;[756]\r\nbut Henry desired to save innocent men from the risk of failure in the\r\n_duellum_ without this subterfuge. If the accused asserted that his\r\nappellant acted “out of spite and hate” (_de odio et atia_), he might\r\npurchase from the royal chancery a writ known by that name, which\r\nreferred the preliminary plea thus raised to the verdict of a sworn body\r\nof twelve recognitors drawn from his own locality. If his neighbours\r\nupheld the plea all further proceedings on the appeal were quashed: the\r\n_duellum_ was avoided.[757] A similar privilege was afterwards extended\r\nto all those guilty of homicide in self-defence, or of homicide by\r\nmisadventure, not of deliberate murder.[758] Soon every man appealed of\r\nmurder, whether guilty or not, alleged as a matter of course that he had\r\nbeen accused groundlessly and maliciously, mere “words of common form.”\r\nThis expansion of the writ’s sphere of usefulness was accompanied by\r\nanother change. The main issue of guilt or innocence, not merely the\r\npreliminary pleas, came to be determined by the neighbours’\r\nverdict,[759] which, whether for or against the accused, was treated as\r\nfinal. No further proceedings were necessary: none were allowed. The\r\n_duellum_ had at last been successfully elbowed aside, although it was\r\nnot abolished until 1819.[760]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 755:\r\n\r\n  In identifying the writ spoken of by Magna Carta as that “of life and\r\n  limbs” with the well-known writ _de odio et atia_, most authorities\r\n  rely on a passage in Bracton (viz.: _folio_ 123). There is still\r\n  better evidence. The Statute of Westminster, II. c. 29, ordains: “Lest\r\n  the parties appealed or indicted be kept long in prison, they shall\r\n  have a writ _de odio et atia_ like as it is declared in Magna Carta\r\n  and other statutes.” Further, in 1231 twelve jurors who had given a\r\n  verdict as to whether an appeal was false, were asked _quo waranto\r\n  fecerunt sacramentum illud de vita et membris_, without the king’s\r\n  licence. See Bracton’s _Note Book_, case 592.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 756:\r\n\r\n  Madox, I. 505, has collected instances.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIII. _Subsidiary Uses of the Writ._ This inquest of life and limb,\r\ndevised as a means of substituting a sworn verdict for the _duellum_ in\r\ncases of homicide, has often been claimed as the direct antecedent of,\r\nif not as identical with, the procedure which in the seventeenth century\r\nbecame so valuable a bulwark of the subject’s liberty, under the name of\r\n_habeas corpus_. This is a mistake; the modern writ of _habeas corpus_\r\nwas developed out of an entirely different writ, which had for its\r\noriginal object the safe-keeping of the prisoner’s body in gaol, not his\r\nliberation from unjust confinement.[761]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 757:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Pollock and Maitland, II. 585-7, and Thayer, _Evidence_, 68.\r\n\r\nFootnote 758:\r\n\r\n  It was extended in another direction also: some of the feudal courts\r\n  adopted a similar procedure in false appeals (although the king\r\n  objected to their doing so without royal licence). Inquests were held\r\n  shortly after the abolition of ordeal (1215) in the court of the Abbot\r\n  of St. Edmund. See Bracton’s _Note Book_, case 592.\r\n\r\nFootnote 759:\r\n\r\n  See Pollock and Maitland, II. 586.\r\n\r\nFootnote 760:\r\n\r\n  59 George III. c. 46.\r\n\r\nFootnote 761:\r\n\r\n  The early history of _habeas corpus_ is traced by Prof. Jenks in a\r\n  learned and interesting article in the _Law Quarterly Review_, VIII.\r\n  164. The writ _de odio_ was obsolete at a date prior to the invention\r\n  of the _habeas corpus_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe opinion generally though erroneously held, is not without excuse;\r\nfor the writ mentioned by Magna Carta, besides effecting its main\r\npurpose, was put to another and subsidiary use, which bears a\r\nsuperficial resemblance to that served by the _habeas corpus_ of later\r\ncenturies. Considerable delay might occur between the appellee’s\r\npetition for the writ of inquisition and the verdict upon it. In the\r\ninterval, the man accused of murder had, in the normal case, no right to\r\nbe released on bail, a privilege allowed to those suspected of less\r\ngrave crimes. This was hard in cases where the accused was the victim of\r\nmalice, or guilty only of justifiable homicide. Prisoners, placed in\r\nsuch a plight, might purchase from the Crown, always ready to accept\r\nfees in a worthy cause, royal writs which would save them from\r\nlanguishing for months or years in gaol. The writ best suited for this\r\npurpose was that _de odio et atia_, since it was already applicable to\r\npresumably innocent appellees for another purpose.[762]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 762:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Brunner, _Entstehung der Schwurgerichte_, p. 471.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAs trial by combat became rapidly obsolete, the original purpose of the\r\nwrit was forgotten, and its once subsidiary object became more\r\nprominent. Before Bracton’s day (possibly even before the date of Magna\r\nCarta) this change had taken place: the writ had come to be viewed\r\nprimarily as an expedient for releasing upon bail homicides _per\r\ninfortunium_ or _se defendendo_. Bracton, in giving the form of the\r\nwrit,[763] declares it to be iniquitous that innocent men accused of\r\nhomicide should be long detained in prison; therefore, he tells us, an\r\ninquisition is wont to be made at the request of sorrowful\r\nfriends—whether the accusation is _bona fide_ or has been brought _de\r\nodio et atia_. This pleasing picture of a king moved to pity by the\r\ntearful friends of accused men scarcely applies to John, who listened\r\nonly to suitors with long purses which they were ready to empty into his\r\nexchequer. The writs which liberated homicides had become a valuable\r\nsource of revenue. Sheriffs were frequently reprimanded for releasing\r\nprisoners on bail without the king’s warrant, but, in spite of heavy\r\namercements, they continued their irregularities, either through favour\r\nto individuals or in return for bribes. Thus, in 1207, Peter of\r\nScudimore paid to the exchequer a fine of 10 marks for setting homicides\r\nfree upon pledges, without warrant from the king or his justices.[764]\r\nIn that year, John repeated his orders, strictly forbidding manslayers\r\nto be set free upon bail, unless by royal command, until they had\r\nreceived judgment in presence of the king’s justices.[765]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 763:\r\n\r\n  See _folio_, 123.\r\n\r\nFootnote 764:\r\n\r\n  See _Pipe Roll_, 8 John, cited Madox, I. 566.\r\n\r\nFootnote 765:\r\n\r\n  See _Rot. Pat._, I. 76, cited Madox, I. 494. The date is 8 November,\r\n  1207.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTo John, then, the excessive and arbitrary fees to be received for this\r\nwrit, constituted its greatest merit; whereas the barons claimed, as\r\nmere matter of justice, that it should be issued free of charge to all\r\nwho needed it. John’s acceptance of their demands, contained in the\r\npresent chapter, was repeated in all reissues, and apparently observed\r\nin practice. The procedure during the reign of Henry III. is described\r\nby Bracton in a passage already cited. After the writ _de odio_ had been\r\nreceived, an inquest, he tells us, must be held speedily, and if the\r\njury decided that the accusation had been made maliciously, or that the\r\nslaying had been committed in self-defence or by accident, the Crown was\r\nto be informed of this. Thereafter, from the chancery would be issued a\r\nsecond writ, the form of which is also given by Bracton (known in later\r\ndays as the writ _tradias in ballium_) directing the sheriff, on the\r\naccused finding twelve good sureties of the county, to “deliver him in\r\nbail to those twelve” till the arrival of the justices. Such writs,\r\nhowever, if in one sense “freely” issued, had always to be paid for. A\r\ncertain Reginald, son of Adam, when accused in 1222, offered one mark to\r\nthe king for a verdict of the three neighbouring counties (it was a\r\nLincolnshire plea), as to whether the accusation was made because of\r\n“the ill-will and hate” (_per odium et atiam_) which William de Ros,\r\nappellant’s lord, bore to Reginald’s father “_vel per verum\r\nappellum_.”[766]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 766:\r\n\r\n  See Bracton’s _Note Book_, case 134, and cf. case 1548.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nA long series of later statutes enforced or modified this procedure.\r\nThese have been interpreted to imply frequent changes of policy,\r\nsometimes abolishing and sometimes reintroducing the writ and the\r\nprocedure which followed it.[767] This is a mistake; the various\r\nstatutes wrought no radical change, but merely modified points of\r\ndetail; sometimes seeking to prevent the release of the guilty on bail,\r\nand sometimes removing difficulties from the path of the innocent. The\r\nStatute of Westminster, I., for example, after a preamble which\r\nanimadverted on the manner in which sheriffs impannelled juries\r\nfavourable to the accused, provided that inquests “shall be taken by\r\nlawful men chosen out by oath (of whom two at the least shall be\r\nknights) which by no affinity with the prisoners nor otherwise are to be\r\nsuspected.”[768] The Statute of Gloucester, on the other hand, ordered\r\nthe strict confinement, pending trial, of offenders whose guilt was\r\napparent.[769] The Statute of Westminster, II. once more favoured\r\nprisoners, providing by chapter 12 for the punishment of false\r\nappellants or accusers, and by chapter 29 that “lest the parties\r\nappealed or indicted be kept long in prison, they shall have a writ of\r\n_odio et atia_, like as it is declared in Magna Carta and other\r\nStatutes.”[770]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 767:\r\n\r\n  Stephen, _Hist. Crim. Law_, I. 242 (following Foster, _Crim. Cases_,\r\n  284–5), considers that it was abolished by 6 Edward I., stat. 1, c. 9.\r\n  Coke, _Second Institute_, 42, thought it was abolished by 28 Edward\r\n  III. c. 9 (which, however, seems not to refer to this at all), and\r\n  restored by 42 Edward III. c. 1 (abolishing all statutes contrary to\r\n  Magna Carta). Coke, _Ibid._, and Hale, _Pleas of the Crown_, II. 148,\r\n  considered that the writ was not obsolete in their day. Cf. Pollock\r\n  and Maitland, II. 587, n.\r\n\r\nFootnote 768:\r\n\r\n  3 Edward I. c. 11.\r\n\r\nFootnote 769:\r\n\r\n  6 Edward I., stat. 1, c. 9.\r\n\r\nFootnote 770:\r\n\r\n  13 Edward I. cc. 12 and 29.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe writ in question was in use in the year 1314,[771] and seems never\r\nto have been expressly abolished, but to have sunk gradually into\r\nneglect, as appeals became obsolete and commissions of gaol delivery\r\nwere more frequently held.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 771:\r\n\r\n  See _Rot. Parl._, I. 323.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIV. _Later History of Appeal and Battle._ The right of private\r\naccusation was restricted only, not abolished, by Henry II. and his\r\nsuccessors. It could not be denied to any injured man, who was not\r\nsuspected of abusing his right. Prosecutions in the king’s name by way\r\nof indictment and jury trial supplemented, without superseding, private\r\nprosecutions by way of appeal and battle. The danger of a second\r\nprosecution might hang over the head of an accused man after he had\r\n“stood his trial” and been honourably acquitted. It was unfair that he\r\nshould be kept in such suspense for ever; and, accordingly, the Statute\r\nof Gloucester provided that the right of appeal should lapse unless\r\nexercised within year and day of the commission of the offence.[772] To\r\nensure that the accused should escape all risk of a double prosecution\r\nfor the same crime, it was necessary that the Crown should supplement\r\nthe provisions of this act by delaying to prosecute until the year and\r\nday had expired. This rule was followed in 1482. Such immunity from\r\narraignment at the king’s suit for the space of twelve months (combined\r\nwith the provisions of the Statute of Gloucester) would undoubtedly have\r\nobviated the possibility of two trials for one offence; but it produced\r\na worse evil of a different kind, by facilitating the escape of\r\ncriminals from justice. After experience of its pernicious effects, this\r\nrule was condemned by the act of parliament which instituted the Star\r\nChamber.[773]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 772:\r\n\r\n  6 Edward I. c. 9. Appeals were extremely frequent towards the close of\r\n  the Plantagenet period, especially in the days of “the Lords\r\n  Appellant.” The proceedings which followed on appeal sometimes took\r\n  place before the Court of the Constable and Marshal and sometimes\r\n  before Parliament. In neither case were they popular. One of the\r\n  charges brought against Richard II. by the Parliament which deposed\r\n  him, was that “in violation of Magna Carta” (that is, probably, of\r\n  chapter 39) persons maliciously accused of treasonable words were\r\n  tried before the constable and marshal, and although they might be\r\n  “old and weak, maimed or infirm,” yet compelled to fight against\r\n  appellants “young, strong, and hearty.” See _Rot. Parl._, III. 420,\r\n  cited Neilson, _Trial by Combat_, 193. On the other hand, the Statute\r\n  1 Henry IV. c. 14 provided that no appeals should in future be held\r\n  before Parliament, but only before the Court of the Constable and\r\n  Marshal.\r\n\r\nFootnote 773:\r\n\r\n  See 3 Henry VII. c. 1, s. 11. This statute emphasized how the injured\r\n  party, with the right of appeal, was “oftentimes slow and also agreed\r\n  with, and by the end of the year all is forgotten, which is another\r\n  occasion of murder.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis remedied the more recent evil, but revived the old injustice; the\r\nsame statute enacted that acquittal should not bar the right of appeal\r\nof the wife or nearest heir of a murdered man. Thus, once again, a man\r\ndeclared innocent by a jury might find himself still exposed to a second\r\nprosecution. This unjust anomaly remained without formal redress until\r\nthe nineteenth century; and in 1817 the British public was startled to\r\nfind that a long-forgotten legal procedure of the dark ages still formed\r\npart of the law of England. The body of a Warwickshire girl, Mary\r\nAshford, was discovered in a pit of water under circumstances which\r\nsuggested foul play. Suspicion fell on Abraham Thornton, who had been in\r\nher company on the night when she disappeared. After indictment and\r\ntrial at Warwick Assizes on a charge of rape and murder, he was\r\nacquitted. The girl’s eldest brother, William Ashford, was not satisfied\r\nby what was apparently a perfectly honest verdict. He tried to secure a\r\nsecond trial, and with this object claimed the ancient right of appeal\r\nof felony, which the judges did not see their way to refuse. Ashford’s\r\nattempt to revive this obsolete procedure was met by Thornton’s revival\r\nof its equally obsolete counterpart. Summoned before the judges of\r\nKing’s Bench, he offered to defend himself by combat, throwing down as\r\n“wager of battle” a glove of approved antique pattern. The judges had to\r\nadmit his legal right to defend himself against the appeal “by his\r\nbody,” and Thornton thus successfully foiled the attempt to force him to\r\na second trial, as the court never contemplated the possibility of a\r\nmedieval judicial combat being actually fought in the nineteenth\r\ncentury. The appeal was withdrawn and the proceedings terminated.[774]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 774:\r\n\r\n  See _Ashford v. Thornton_, 1 B. and Ald. 405-461.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe unexpected revival of these legal curiosities of an earlier age led\r\nto their final suppression. In 1819 a Statute was passed abolishing\r\nproof by battle alike in criminal and in civil pleas; and the right of\r\nappeal fell with it.[775]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 775:\r\n\r\n  See 59 George III. c. 46.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN.\r\n\r\nSi aliquis teneat de nobis per feodifirmam, vel per sokagium, vel per\r\nburgagium, et de alio terram teneat per servicium militare, nos non\r\nhabebimus custodiam heredis nec terre sue que est de feodo alterius,\r\noccasione illius feodifirme, vel sokagii, vel burgagii; nec habebimus\r\ncustodiam illius feodifirme, vel sokagii, vel burgagii, nisi ipsa\r\nfeodifirma debeat servicium militare. Nos non habebimus custodiam\r\nheredis vel terre alicujus, quam tenet de alio per servicium militare,\r\noccasione alicujus parve serjanterie quam tenet de nobis per servicium\r\nreddendi nobis cultellos, vel sagittas, vel hujusmodi.\r\n\r\n  If anyone holds of us by fee-farm, by socage, or by burgage, and holds\r\n  also land of another lord by knight’s service, we will not (by reason\r\n  of that fee-farm, socage, or burgage,) have the wardship of the heir,\r\n  or of such land of his as is of the fief of that other; nor shall we\r\n  have wardship of that fee-farm, socage, or burgage, unless such\r\n  fee-farm owes knight’s service. We will not by reason of any petty\r\n  serjeanty which anyone may hold of us by the service of rendering to\r\n  us knives, arrows, or the like, have wardship of his heir or of the\r\n  land which he holds of another lord by knight’s service.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy these provisions the Charter reverts once more to the subject of\r\nwardship, laying down three rules which will be better understood when\r\ntheir sequence is somewhat altered, the second being taken first.\r\n\r\n(1) _Ordinary wardship._ The reason for claiming wardship from lands\r\nheld in chivalry, namely, that a boy tenant could not perform military\r\nservice, did not apply to fee-farm, to socage, or to burgage. There was\r\nmuch looseness of usage, however; and of this John took full advantage.\r\nThe Charter stated the law explicitly; wardship was not due from any\r\nsuch holdings, except in the somewhat anomalous cases where lands in\r\nfee-farm expressly owed military service.[776] As petty serjeanties\r\n(although mentioned in the present chapter in a different connection)\r\nare not expressly said to share this exemption, it may be inferred that\r\nthe barons admitted John’s wardship over them, just as in the case of\r\ngreat serjeanties. In Littleton’s time, the law had been changed. Petty\r\nserjeanties were then exempt.[777]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 776:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, pp. 66-70, and 75-7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 777:\r\n\r\n  II. viii. s. 158.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(2) _Prerogative wardship._ When a tenant-in-chivalry died leaving two\r\nseparate military fiefs held of different mesne lords, each of these\r\nlords enjoyed, during the minority, wardship over his own fief. This was\r\nperfectly fair to all parties; but if the ward held one estate of the\r\nCrown, and another of a mesne lord, the king claimed wardship over both;\r\nand that, too, even when the Crown fief was of small value.[778] Such\r\nrights were known as “prerogative wardship,” and thus limited, were in\r\n1215 perfectly legal, however inequitable they may now seem.\r\n\r\nFootnote 778:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Glanvill, VII. c. 10. “When any one holds of the king _in capite_\r\n  the wardship over him belongs exclusively to the king, whether the\r\n  heir has any other lords or not; because the king can have no equal,\r\n  much less a superior.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Fee-farm, socage, and burgage._ John, however, pushed this right\r\nfurther, and exercised prerogative wardship over fiefs of mesne lords,\r\nnot merely by occasion of Crown fiefs held in chivalry, but also by\r\noccasion of Crown fiefs held by any other free tenure. It was outrageous\r\nthus to claim prerogative wardship in respect of fee-farm, socage, or\r\nburgage lands, which were themselves exempt from ordinary wardship. John\r\naccordingly was made to promise amendment.[779]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 779:\r\n\r\n  Glanvill, VII. c. 10, had laid it down that burgage tenure could not\r\n  give rise to prerogative wardship.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Petty Serjeanties_[780] were in a slightly different position.\r\nAlthough Magna Carta did not abolish the Crown’s rights of ordinary\r\nwardship over these, it forbade that that should form an occasion of\r\nprerogative wardship. The king might enjoy the custody of his own fief\r\nif he pleased, but not of the wider fiefs of others on that\r\npretext.[781]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 780:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, p. 68.\r\n\r\nFootnote 781:\r\n\r\n  See Bracton, _folio_ 87 b. The _Note Book_, case 743, contains a good\r\n  illustration. The motive for these restrictions was clearly to prevent\r\n  injustice to mesne lords. It was probably, however, an indirect\r\n  consequence of Magna Carta that a similar rule came to be applied\r\n  where no mesne lord was injuriously affected. In 1231 a certain Ralf\r\n  of Bradeley died who had held two separate freeholds of the Crown, (i)\r\n  a small fee by petty serjeanty for which he rendered twenty arrows a\r\n  year, and (ii) land of considerable value held in socage. The Crown\r\n  took possession of both estates, on the assumption that the admitted\r\n  right of wardship over the petty serjeanty brought with it a right of\r\n  wardship over the socage lands also (although these would have been\r\n  exempt if they had stood alone). The king sold his rights for 300\r\n  marks. Ralf’s widow claimed the wardship of the socage lands, on the\r\n  ground that these were of much greater value than those held by\r\n  serjeanty. Her argument was upheld, and the 300 marks were refunded by\r\n  the exchequer to the disappointed purchaser. See _Pipe Roll_, 5 Henry\r\n  III., cited Madox, I. 325-6.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nPrerogative wardship (even in the limited form admitted by Magna Carta)\r\nmight involve a double hardship on the mesne lord deprived by it of the\r\ncustody of his fief. Suppose that the common tenant held lands from a\r\nmesne lord on condition of, say, five knights’ service, in addition to\r\nhis Crown fief. The king seized both fiefs on his death, nominally as a\r\ncompensation for the loss of military service, which the minor heir\r\ncould not render. Yet when a scutage ran the king demanded from the\r\nmesne lord payments in proportion to his full _quota_ without allowing\r\nfor the fees of five knights taken from him by prerogative wardship.\r\nThis is no imaginary case. The barons in 1258 complained of the practice\r\nand demanded redress.[782]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 782:\r\n\r\n  See Petition of the Barons, article 2 (_Select Charters_, 383). C. 53\r\n  of Magna Carta reverts to prerogative wardship, granting redress,\r\n  although not summary redress, where John, or his father or brother,\r\n  had illegally extended it by occasion of socage, etc. See also\r\n  _supra_, p. 241.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT.\r\n\r\nNullus ballivus ponat de cetero aliquem ad legem simplici loquela sua,\r\nsine testibus fidelibus ad hoc inductis.\r\n\r\n  No bailiff for the future shall put any man to his “law” upon his own\r\n  mere word of mouth, without credible witnesses brought for this\r\n  purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evident intention of this provision was to prevent irregularities at\r\nthe critical stage of a trial, when the _lex_ appointed by the court was\r\nattempted. This word _lex_, in its technical sense, may be correctly\r\napplied to any form of judicial test, such as compurgation, ordeal, or\r\ncombat, the precise meaning required in each particular case being\r\ndetermined by the context.[783] In this passage of Magna Carta, it may\r\nbe used in its widest connotation, but reasons will be immediately\r\nadduced for the belief that _ordeal_ was specially present to the minds\r\nof those who framed it. Bailiffs, (the word is a wide one, including\r\ncertainly the sheriffs and their underlings, and possibly also the\r\nstewards who presided in manorial courts)[784] had evidently been guilty\r\nof irregularities which public opinion of the day condemned. So much is\r\nclear: but authorities differ widely as to the exact nature of the abuse\r\nwhich is here prohibited.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 783:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Stubbs (_Const. Hist._, I. 576) translates “_lex_” in this passage\r\n  by “compurgation or ordeal.” Pollock and Maitland (II. 604, n.)\r\n  explain that the word “does not necessarily point to unilateral\r\n  ordeal; it may well stand for trial by battle.” Thayer (_Evidence_,\r\n  199–200) extends it even further, so as to embrace judicially\r\n  appointed tests of every kind—battle, ordeal of fire or water, simple\r\n  oath, oath with compurgators, charter, transaction witnesses, or sworn\r\n  verdict. Bigelow (_Placita Anglo-Normannica_, 44) cites from Domesday\r\n  Book cases where litigants offered proof _omni lege_ or _omnibus\r\n  legibus_, that is, in any way the court decided. Sometimes _lex_ had a\r\n  more restricted meaning; in the Customs of Newcastle-on-Tyne _(Select\r\n  Charters_, 112) it seems to mean compurgation as opposed to combat.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 784:\r\n\r\n  Cf _supra_, c. 24. Coke, _Second Institute_, p. 44, following the\r\n  doubtful authority of the _Mirror of Justices_, extends it to all\r\n  king’s justices and ministers. The unqualified “_ballivus_” of this\r\n  passage should, perhaps, be contrasted with the “_noster ballivus_” of\r\n  cc. 28 and 30.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI. _Probable Object of the Chapter._ The key is supplied by the words of\r\narticle 4 of the Assize of Clarendon, the provisions of which still\r\nregulated the Crown’s practice in criminal cases in the reign of John.\r\nThat ordinance explains the procedure to be followed when robbers,\r\nmurderers, or thieves, apprehended by the sheriffs upon indictment, were\r\nbrought before the justices for trial: “and the sheriffs shall bring\r\nthem before the justices; and with them they shall bring two lawful men\r\nof the hundred and of the village where they were apprehended, to bear\r\nthe record of the county and of the hundred, as to why they had been\r\napprehended; and, there, before the justices they shall make their law.”\r\nThis “law” is elsewhere in the ordinance clearly identified with\r\nordeal;[785] and the purport of the whole was that accused men could not\r\nbe put to ordeal except in presence of two lawful men who had been\r\npresent at the indictment and had come before the justices specially to\r\nbear witness thereof. In other words, the sheriff’s verbal report of the\r\nindictment “_sine testibus fidelibus ad hoc inductis_” was not\r\nsufficient. The “county” and the “hundred” which had accused the\r\nprisoner must send representatives to bear record of the facts.[786]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 785:\r\n\r\n  See article 12 where “_eat ad aquam_” is contrasted with “_non habeat\r\n  legem_” of article 13 (_Select Charters_, 144).\r\n\r\nFootnote 786:\r\n\r\n  The “_ad portandum recordationem comitatus et hundredi_” of the\r\n  ordinance is exactly opposed to the “_simplex loquela sua_” of the\r\n  Charter.\r\n\r\nThe ordeal indeed was a solemn affair for which careful rules had been\r\nlaid down. Every precaution was taken against the sheriff abusing his\r\nauthority. His account of the indictment was checked by the presence of\r\nsubordinate officials as well as of these members of the accusing jury.\r\nMoreover, lords of feudal courts, claiming this franchise, could only\r\nexercise it under royal warrant. Henry, the inventor of the system,\r\nsternly repressed all irregularities whether those of his own bailiffs\r\nor of the stewards of private lords.[787]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 787:\r\n\r\n  Thus in 1166 (the year of the Assize of Clarendon) the “_Soca_” of\r\n  Alverton was amerced because of a man placed “_ad aquam sine\r\n  serviente_” (_Pipe Roll_, 12 Henry II., p. 49 of edition of Pipe Roll\r\n  Society). In 1185 the “_villata_” of Preston paid 5 marks for putting\r\n  a man “_ad aquam sine waranto_” (_Pipe Roll_, 31 Henry II., cited\r\n  Madox, I. 547). In the same year a certain Roger owed half a mark for\r\n  being present at an ordeal “_sine visu servientum regis_”: and heavy\r\n  fines were exacted from those who had put a man “_injuste ad aquam_”\r\n  (_Ibid._). Apparently the bailiffs were sometimes described as the\r\n  king’s serjeants and sometimes as the sheriff’s serjeants: the same\r\n  Roll records fines for a man buried “_sine visu servientum\r\n  vicecomitis_” and for a robber hanged “_sine visu servientis regis_”\r\n  (_Pipe Roll_, 31 Henry II.).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe same rules of procedure prevailed under John, who was less careful,\r\nhowever, than his father had been, to suppress irregularities. In Magna\r\nCarta he promised amendment. The presence of witnesses required by the\r\nAssize of Clarendon was once more insisted on as a check upon the\r\ncapricious or unfair use of the ordeal. The Charter of 1216 repeated\r\nthis provision without alteration. In 1217, however, a change occurred,\r\nwhich was undoubtedly a consequence of the virtual abolition of the\r\nordeal by the Lateran Council in 1215. The framers of Henry’s second\r\nreissue, no longer so engrossed in pressing matters of state as they had\r\nbeen in the previous year, found leisure to adjust points of\r\nadministrative detail. The simple reference to ordeal was inappropriate\r\nnow that new forms of trial were taking its place. The justices, indeed,\r\nscarcely knew what test they should appoint, when ordeal had been\r\nforbidden. They seem sometimes to have resorted to compurgation and\r\nsometimes to battle; but the sworn verdict of neighbours was fast\r\noccupying the ground left vacant. The new Charter then made it clear\r\nthat the provisions applied in 1215 to ordeal were to be extended to the\r\nother tests which were now being substituted for it. The “_ad legem_” of\r\nJohn’s Charter became in the new version “_ad legem manifestam nec ad\r\njuramentum_,” which might very well include battle and the decisions of\r\njurors, as well as ordeal.[788]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 788:\r\n\r\n  See Thayer, _Evidence_, 37, n. for a case of 1291, where “_ad legem\r\n  manifestam_” can only mean trial by combat. The Statute of Westminster\r\n  I. (3 Edward I. c. 12) described men refusing to put themselves on a\r\n  jury’s verdict, “_come ceaus qui refusent la commune ley de la\r\n  terre_.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nII. _Medieval Interpretations of the Passage._ Ignorance of the exact\r\nnature of the abuse prohibited may well be excused at the present day,\r\nsince it had become obscure within a century of the granting of the\r\nCharter. Some legal notes of the early fourteenth century, containing\r\nthree alternative suggestions, have come down to us.[789]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 789:\r\n\r\n  These appear as an appendix to the Year Book of 32-3 Edward I. (p.\r\n  516); but the handwriting is supposed to be of the reign of Edward II.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(1) The first interpretation discussed, and apparently dismissed, in\r\nthese notes, was that Magna Carta by this prohibition wished to ensure\r\nthat no one should serve on a jury (_in juratam_) unless he had been\r\nwarned by a timely summons. This far-fetched suggestion is clearly\r\nerroneous.\r\n\r\n(2) The next hypothesis raised is that the clause prevented the\r\ndefendant on a writ of debt (or any similar writ) from winning his case\r\nby his unsupported oath, where compurgators ought to have sworn along\r\nwith him. Exception was, in this view, taken to the bailiff treating\r\nfavoured _defendants_ in civil pleas with unfair leniency.\r\n\r\n(3) A third opinion is stated and eulogized as a better one, namely that\r\nthe Charter prohibited bailiffs from showing undue favour to\r\n_plaintiffs_ in civil pleas. The defendant on a writ of debt (or the\r\nlike) should not, in this interpretation of Magna Carta, be compelled to\r\ngo to proof at all (that is, to make his “law”) unless the plaintiff had\r\nbrought “suit” against him (that is, had raised a presumption that the\r\nclaim was good, by production of preliminary witnesses or by some\r\nrecognized equivalent).[790] This last of the three interpretations thus\r\nsuggested in the reign of Edward II. has its modern adherents, as will\r\nimmediately be shown; but the discussion inaugurated in Plantagenet days\r\nhas not yet received an authoritative settlement. It was discussed in\r\nthe Court of Common Pleas so recently as 1700,[791] and historians at\r\nthe present day differ as widely as do the lawyers.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 790:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, pp. 101-2. The necessity for such “suit” was not legally\r\n  abolished until 1852 (by Statute 15 and 16 Victoria, c. 76, s. 55). In\r\n  1343 it had been decided that the “suit” must be in existence, but\r\n  need not be produced in court; and that if they did appear they could\r\n  not be examined. See Thayer, _Evidence_, 13–15.\r\n\r\nFootnote 791:\r\n\r\n  See City of London _v._ Wood, cited _infra_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIII. _Modern Interpretations of the Passage._ No two of the recent\r\nauthorities hold precisely similar opinions. Four views, at least, may\r\nbe distinguished. (1) The provision is sometimes regarded as an attempt\r\nto prevent plaintiffs in civil suits from being treated with undue\r\nfavour to the prejudice of defendants. A “suit” of witnesses\r\n(_sectatores_) had to be produced in court by the plaintiff before any\r\n“trial” (_lex_) could take place at all. Bailiffs were forbidden to\r\nallow, through slackness, favour, or bribery, this rule to be relaxed.\r\nThis interpretation, which was adopted by the author of the _Mirror of\r\nJustices_, and by the writer of the notes appended to the Year Book\r\nalready cited, found favour with Chief Justice Holt in 1700.[792]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 792:\r\n\r\n  See City of London _v._ Wood (12 Modern Reports, 669). Holt held the\r\n  clause of Magna Carta to mean that the plaintiff, unless he had his\r\n  witnesses, could not put a defendant to his oath. Pollock and\r\n  Maitland, II. 604, seem to concur, to the extent at least of counting\r\n  this as one of the abuses condemned by c. 38: “The rule which required\r\n  a suit of witnesses had been regarded as a valuable rule; in 1215 the\r\n  barons demanded that no exception to it should be allowed in favour of\r\n  royal officers.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(2) A second theory treats the clause as forbidding bailiffs (whether\r\nroyal officers or manorial stewards) to use their authority to forward\r\nsuits to which they happened to be parties. In certain circumstances, it\r\nwould seem, the steward who presided as his master’s representative over\r\nthe manorial court claimed the right to put a defendant to his proof,\r\nwithout first producing “suit” or its equivalent, a privilege, however,\r\nwhich he could exercise only once in every year. Royal bailiffs claimed\r\nthis privilege, and that without any similar restrictions. One object of\r\nMagna Carta, in this view, was to reduce bailiffs to an equality with\r\nother litigants. No longer should their bare assertion enable them to\r\ndispense with the formalities which the court required from ordinary\r\nplaintiffs before putting their adversaries to the risk of “a law” or\r\nproof.[793]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 793:\r\n\r\n  This reading is emphasized by Brunner, _Entstehung der\r\n  Schwurgerichte_, 199-200.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(3) In marked contrast to these two theories, which read Magna Carta as\r\npreventing undue favour to plaintiffs, comes a third which regards it as\r\nforbidding undue favour to defendants. The Crown, it is pointed out,\r\nfavoured Jews against Christians with whom they went to law. The Hebrew\r\ndefendant in a civil suit “might purge himself by his bare oath on the\r\nPentateuch, whereas in a similar case a Christian, as the law then\r\nstood, might be required to wage his law twelve-handed—_i.e._ with\r\neleven compurgators.”[794] Magna Carta, it has been suggested, struck at\r\nthis preferential treatment of Jewish litigants, trebly hated as aliens,\r\ncapitalists, and rejectors of Christ. If so, the attempt failed; for in\r\n1275 a certain Hebrew, named Abraham, was allowed “to make his law\r\nsingle-handed on his Book of the Jewish Law” in face of the plaintiff’s\r\nprotest that this was contrary to the custom of the realm.[795]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 794:\r\n\r\n  See J. M. Rigg’s admirable preface to Sel. _Pleas from Rolls of Jewish\r\n  Exchequer_, p. xii., and cf. _supra_, c. 10.\r\n\r\nFootnote 795:\r\n\r\n  See _Ibid._, p. 89, where the case is cited.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(4) A fourth theory reads the chapter as a prohibition of undue severity\r\nin criminal prosecutions. A formal indictment by the accusing jury must\r\nalways precede the “trial.” No bailiff ought to put anyone to the water\r\nor the red-hot iron upon suspicion, or private information.[796] Much\r\nmay be said for this interpretation so far as it goes; but the Assize of\r\nClarendon and Magna Carta agree in demanding something more. It was not\r\nenough that indictment should precede ordeal; they required that some\r\nmembers of the presenting jury who had made the accusation at the first\r\ndiet should accompany the sheriff before the justices at the final diet,\r\nthere to bear testimony both as to the nature of the crime and as to the\r\nfact of the indictment. Before anyone could be put “to his law,” the\r\nsheriff’s verbal report must be corroborated by the testimony of\r\nrepresentative jurors.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 796:\r\n\r\n  This reading is supported by Pollock and Maitland, I. 130, n. There is\r\n  no necessary inconsistency between the view here cited, and that\r\n  already cited from _Ibid._ II. 604. The same clause of Magna Carta may\r\n  have been aimed at irregularities of two kinds, in civil and criminal\r\n  pleas respectively.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE.\r\n\r\nNullus liber homo capiatur, vel imprisonetur, aut disseisiatur, aut\r\nutlagetur, aut exuletur, aut aliquo modo destruatur, nec super eum\r\nibimus, nec super eum mittemus, nisi per legale judicium parium suorum\r\nvel per legem terre.\r\n\r\n  No freeman shall be arrested, or detained in prison, or deprived of\r\n  his freehold, or outlawed, or banished, or in any way molested; and we\r\n  will not set forth against him, nor send against him,[797] unless by\r\n  the lawful judgment of his peers and by the law of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 797:\r\n\r\n  The corresponding provision of the Articles of the Barons (29) adds\r\n  the word “_vi_” (“_nec rex eat vel mittat super eum vi_”). The idea of\r\n  open violence, thus clearly indicated, is expressed in contemporary\r\n  documents by the fuller phrase, _per vim et arma_. The accepted\r\n  translation, as contained in the _Statutes at Large_, “nor will we\r\n  pass upon him nor condemn him,” is thus inadequate. The editors of the\r\n  _Statutes of the Realm_, I. 117, suggest “deal with him” as an\r\n  alternative translation. Coke, it will be seen _infra_, is the\r\n  original source of the error which connects this “going” and “sending”\r\n  with legal process.\r\n\r\nThis chapter occupies a prominent place in law-books, and is of\r\nconsiderable importance, although there are reasons for holding that its\r\nvalue has been grossly exaggerated.\r\n\r\nI. _Its Main Object._ It has been usual to read it as containing a\r\nguarantee of trial by jury to all Englishmen; as absolutely prohibiting\r\narbitrary commitment; and as undertaking solemnly to dispense to all and\r\nsundry an equal justice, full, free, and speedy.[798] The traditional\r\ninterpretation has thus made it, in the widest terms, a promise of law\r\nand liberty, and good government to every one.[799] A careful analysis\r\nof the words of the clause, read in connection with its historical\r\ngenesis, suggests the need for modifications of this view. It was in\r\naccord with the practical genius of this great document that it should\r\ndirect its energies, not to the enunciation of vague platitudes and\r\nwell-sounding generalities, but to the reform of a specific and clearly\r\ndefined group of abuses. Its main object was to prohibit John from\r\nresorting to what is sometimes whimsically known in Scotland as “Jeddart\r\njustice.”[800] It forbade him for the future to place execution before\r\njudgment. Three aspects of this prohibition may be emphasized.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 798:\r\n\r\n  See, _e.g._, Coke, _Second Institute_, 55.\r\n\r\nFootnote 799:\r\n\r\n  Thus Blackstone, _Commentaries_, IV. 424: “It protected every\r\n  individual of the nation in the free enjoyment of his life, his\r\n  liberty, and his property, unless declared to be forfeited by the\r\n  judgment of his peers or the law of the land.” Hallam, _Middle Ages_,\r\n  II. 448, speaking of cc. 39 and 40 together, says they “protect the\r\n  personal liberty and property of all freemen by giving security from\r\n  arbitrary imprisonment and arbitrary spoliation.” Creasy, _English\r\n  Constitution_, p. 151, n.: “The ultimate effect of this chapter was to\r\n  give and to guarantee full protection for person and property to every\r\n  human being that breathes English air.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 800:\r\n\r\n  The same grim tradition applied to Lidford as to Jedburgh:\r\n\r\n                   “I oft have heard of Lydford law,\r\n                   How in the morn they hang and draw,\r\n                       And sit in judgment after.”\r\n\r\n  See Neilson, _Trial by Combat_, 131, and authorities there cited.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(1) _Judgment must precede execution._ In some isolated cases, happily\r\nnot numerous, John proceeded, or threatened to proceed, by force of arms\r\nagainst recalcitrants as though assured of their guilt, without waiting\r\nfor legal procedure.[801] Complaint was made of arrests and\r\nimprisonments suffered “without judgment” (_absque judicio_); and these\r\nare the very words used in the \"unknown charter\"—“_Concedit Rex Johannes\r\nquod non capiet homines absque judicio_.”[802] Both the Articles of the\r\nBarons and Magna Carta expand this phrase. _Absque judicio becomes nisi\r\nper legale judicium parium suorum vel per legem terre_, thus guarding,\r\nnot merely against the more obvious evil—execution without judgment—but\r\nalso against John’s subtler device for attacking his enemies by a\r\ntravesty of judicial process. The Charter asks not only for a\r\n“judgment,” but for a “judgment of peers” and “according to the law of\r\nthe land.” Two species of irregularities were condemned by these words;\r\nand these will be explained in the two following subsections.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 801:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Bigelow considers that such cases were numerous. See _Procedure_,\r\n  155: “The practice of granting writs of execution without trial in the\r\n  courts appears to have been common.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 802:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(2) _Per judicium parium_: every judgment must be delivered by the\r\naccused man’s “equals.” The need for “a judgment of peers” was\r\nrecognized at an early date in England.[803] It was not originally a\r\nclass privilege of the aristocracy, but a right shared by all grades of\r\nfreeholders; whatever their rank they could not be tried by their\r\ninferiors.[804] In this respect English custom did not differ from the\r\nprocedure prescribed by feudal usage on the Continent of Europe.[805]\r\nTwo applications of this general principle had, however, special\r\ninterest for the framers of Magna Carta: the “peers” of a Crown tenant\r\nwere his fellow Crown tenants, who would normally deliver judgment in\r\nthe _Curia Regis_; while the “peers” of the tenant of a mesne lord were\r\nthe other freeholding tenants assembled in the Court Baron of the manor.\r\nIn either case judgments were given _per pares curiae_, who decided what\r\n“test” should be appointed, who thereafter sat as umpires while their\r\naccused “peer” carried this through to success or failure, and who\r\nfinally pronounced a sentence in accordance with the result. Crown\r\ntenants and under-tenants alike complained that they were deprived by\r\nJohn of the only safeguard they could trust, the judgment of a full\r\ncourt of Englishmen of their own rank, who presumably, therefore, had no\r\nundue bias towards conviction. John, not here an innovator, but merely\r\nresorting wholesale to practices used sparingly and with prudence in\r\nearlier reigns, had set these rights openly at defiance. His political\r\nand personal enemies were frequently exiled, or deprived of their\r\nestates, by the judgment of a tribunal composed entirely of Crown\r\nnominees ready to give any sentence which John might dictate. Magna\r\nCarta promised a return to the recognized ancient practice. No freeman\r\nshould henceforth suffer in person or in property as the result of a\r\njudgment by the professional judges forming the bench of Common Pleas,\r\nor the other bench known as _coram rege_. This was to abolish not merely\r\nthe abuses of John, but the system of Henry II., which he abused.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 803:\r\n\r\n  The earliest known reference occurs in the so-called _Leges Henrici\r\n  primi_ (c. 31). _Unusquisque per pares suos judicandus est et ejusdem\r\n  provinciae_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 804:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Pollock and Maitland, I. 152, and authority cited. As there was no\r\n  “peerage” in England in the modern sense (cf. _supra_, p. 237) until\r\n  long after John’s reign, it is obvious that the _judicium parium_ of\r\n  Magna Carta must be interpreted in a broader sense than any mere\r\n  “privilege of a peer” at the present day. Every man’s equals were his\r\n  “peers.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 805:\r\n\r\n  See Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, I. 578, n., for foreign examples of\r\n  _judicium parium_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe varied meanings conveyed by the word “peers” to a medieval mind,\r\ntogether with the nature of _judicium parium_, may be further\r\nillustrated by the special rules applicable to four exceptional classes\r\nof individuals:—(_a_) all Jews of England and Normandy enjoyed under\r\nJohn’s charter of 10th April, 1201, the right to have complaints against\r\nthem judged by men of their own race. For them a _judicium parium_ was a\r\njudgment of Jews.[806] (_b_) A foreign merchant, by later statutes,\r\nobtained the right to a special form of _judicium parium_—to a jury of\r\nthe “half tongue” (_de medietate linguae_), composed partly of aliens of\r\nhis own country.[807] (_c_) The peers of a Welshman seem, in some\r\ndisputes with the Crown, to have been men drawn from the marches, and\r\ntherefore unlikely to side entirely either with the English or with the\r\nWelsh point of view. Such at least is the most plausible interpretation\r\nof the phrase “_in marchia per judicium parium suorum_,” occurring in\r\nlater chapters of Magna Carta, and granting to the Welsh redress of\r\nwrongful disseisins.[808] (_d_) A Lord Marcher occupied a peculiar\r\nposition, enjoying rights denied to barons whose estates lay in more\r\nsettled parts of England. In 1281 the Earl of Gloucester, accused by\r\nEdward I. of a breach of allegiance, claimed to be judged, not by the\r\nwhole body of Crown tenants, but by such as were, like himself, lords\r\nmarchers.[809] These illustrations show that a “trial by peers” had a\r\nwider and less stereotyped meaning in the Middle Ages than it has at the\r\npresent day.[810]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 806:\r\n\r\n  “If a Christian bring a complaint against a Jew, let it be adjudged by\r\n  his peers of the Jews.” See _Rot. Chartarum_, p. 93, and _supra_ p.\r\n  269.\r\n\r\nFootnote 807:\r\n\r\n  See _Carta Mercatoria_, c. 8; 27 Edward III. stat. 2, c. 8; and 28\r\n  Edward III. c. 13; also Thayer, _Evidence_, p. 94.\r\n\r\nFootnote 808:\r\n\r\n  See _infra_, cc. 56, 57, and 58. Under c. 59 the barons of England\r\n  were called peers of the King of Scots.\r\n\r\nFootnote 809:\r\n\r\n  See _Placitorum Abbreviatio_, p. 201, cited Pollock and Maitland, I.\r\n  393 n.\r\n\r\nFootnote 810:\r\n\r\n  See also a passage in the Scots Acts of Parliament (I. 318) attributed\r\n  to David: “No man shall be judged by his inferior who is not his peer;\r\n  the earl shall be judged by the earl, the baron by the baron, the\r\n  vavassor by the vavassor, the burgess by the burgess; but an inferior\r\n  may be judged by a superior.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(3) _Per legem terrae._ No freeman could be punished except in\r\naccordance with the law of England. These often-quoted words were used\r\nin Magna Carta with special though not perhaps exclusive reference to\r\nthe narrow technical meaning of “_lex_” which was so prominent in 1215\r\nand which has been already explained.[811] The Great Charter promised\r\nthat no plea, civil or criminal, should henceforth be decided against\r\nany freeman until he had failed in the customary \"proof\"—whether battle,\r\nor ordeal, or otherwise.[812]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 811:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, p. 103, and cc. 18, 36, and 38.\r\n\r\nFootnote 812:\r\n\r\n  See Thayer, _Evidence_, 200–1, for a discussion of the phrase “_lex\r\n  terrae_.” See also Bigelow, _History of Procedure_, 155, n.: “The\r\n  expression ‘_per legem terrae_’ simply required judicial proceedings,\r\n  according to the nature of the case; the duel, ordeal, or\r\n  compurgation, in criminal cases, the duel, witnesses, charters, or\r\n  recognition in property cases.” The words occur at least twice in\r\n  Glanvill, each time apparently with the technical meaning. In II. c.\r\n  19, the penalty for a false verdict includes forfeiture by jurors of\r\n  their law (“_legem terrae amittentes_”); while in V. c. 5, a man born\r\n  a villein, though freed by his lord, cannot, to the prejudice of any\r\n  stranger, wage his law (“_ad aliquam legem terrae faciendam_”). The\r\n  stress placed on the accused’s right to the time-honoured forms of\r\n  _lex_ is well illustrated by the difficulty of substituting jury trial\r\n  for ordeal. It has already been shown that the right of “standing\r\n  mute,” that is, virtually, of demanding ordeal, was only abolished in\r\n  1772. See _supra_, p. 400. Five and a half centuries were thus allowed\r\n  to pass before the criminal law was bold enough, in defiance of a\r\n  fundamental principle of Magna Carta, to deprive accused men of their\r\n  “law.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis older, more technical signification was gradually forgotten, and\r\n“the law of the land” became the vague and somewhat meaningless phrase\r\nof the popular speech of to-day. It was only natural that this change of\r\nmeaning should be reflected in subsequent statutes reaffirming,\r\nexpanding, or explaining Magna Carta. An important series of these,\r\npassed in the reigns of Edward III. and Richard II., shows how the _per\r\nlegem terrae_ of 1215 was read in the fourteenth century as equivalent\r\nto the wider expression “by due process of law,” and how the Great\r\nCharter was interpreted as prohibiting the trial of men for their lives\r\nand limbs before the King’s Council on mere informal and irresponsible\r\nsuggestions, sometimes made loosely or from malicious and interested\r\nmotives.[813]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 813:\r\n\r\n  It would seem, however, from the words of these statutes that for this\r\n  purpose the provisions of chapters 36 and 38 were used to supplement\r\n  those of the present chapter, if they were not confused with them. See\r\n  5 Edward III. c. 9; 25 Edward III. stat. 5, c. 4; 37 Edward III. c.\r\n  18; 38 Edward III. c. 3; 42 Edward III. c. 3; 17 Richard II. c. 6. See\r\n  also Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, II. 637-9, for the series of petitions\r\n  beginning with 1351.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1352, for example, after reciting the provision of Magna\r\nCarta at present under discussion, insisted on the necessity of\r\n“indictment or presentment of good and lawful people of the same\r\nneighbourhood where such deeds be done.” Coke,[814] founding apparently\r\non the terms of these fourteenth-century statutes, makes “_per legem\r\nterrae_” of the Charter equivalent to “by due process of law” and that\r\nagain to “by indictment or presentment of good and lawful men,” thus\r\nfinding the grand jury enshrined in Magna Carta. The framers of the\r\nPetition of Right[815] read the same words as a prohibition, not only of\r\nimprisonment “without any cause showed” but also of proceedings under\r\nmartial law, thus interpreting the aims of King John’s opponents in the\r\nlight of the misdeeds of King Charles, and applying to the rude system\r\nestablished by Henry of Anjou reforms more appropriate to the highly\r\ndeveloped administration of the Tudors.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 814:\r\n\r\n  _Second Institute_, p. 46.\r\n\r\nFootnote 815:\r\n\r\n  3 Charles I. c. 1.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThese glosses must be discarded; the words of John’s Charter promised a\r\nthreefold security to all the freemen of England. Their persons and\r\nproperty were protected from the king’s arbitrary will by the rule that\r\nexecution should be preceded by a judgment—by a judgment of peers—by a\r\njudgment according to the appropriate time-honoured “test,” battle,\r\ncompurgation, or ordeal.\r\n\r\n(4) _The meaning of “vel.”_ The peculiar use of the word “_vel_”\r\nintroduced an unfortunate element of ambiguity. No proceedings were to\r\ntake place \"without lawful judgment of peers or by the law of the\r\nland\"—“or” thus occurring where “and” might naturally be expected.\r\nAuthorities on medieval Latin are agreed, however, that “_vel_” is\r\nsometimes equivalent to _et_.[816] Comparison with the terms of chapter\r\n52 and with those of the corresponding Article of the Barons places the\r\nmatter almost beyond doubt. The 25th of the Articles of the Barons had\r\nprovided that all men disseised by Henry or Richard should “have right\r\nwithout delay by judgment of their peers in the king’s court,” giving no\r\nhint of any possible alternative to _judicium parium_. Chapter 52 of the\r\nCharter, in supplementing the present chapter, describes the evils\r\ncomplained of in both as acts of disseisin or outlawry by the king\r\n“_sine legale judicio parium suorum_,” leaving no room for ambiguity.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 816:\r\n\r\n  Pollock and Maitland, I. 152, n., read the word as having _both_\r\n  meanings in this passage. Cf. Gneist, _Engl. Const._, chapter xviii.\r\n  Mr. Pike, _House of Lords_, 170, takes an opposite view: “King John\r\n  bound himself in such a manner as to show that judgment of peers was\r\n  one thing, the law of the land another. The judgment of peers was ...\r\n  a very simple matter and well understood at the time. The law of the\r\n  land included all legal proceedings, civil or criminal, other than the\r\n  judgment of peers.” The present writer rejects this antithesis,\r\n  because the two things may be, and indeed must be, combined. The\r\n  “trial” by a law and the “judgment” by equals were complementary of\r\n  each other. The peers appointed the test and decided whether it had\r\n  been properly fulfilled.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nII. _The Scope of the Protection afforded._ The object of the barons was\r\nto protect themselves and their friends against the king, not to set\r\nforth a scientific system of jurisprudence: the _judicium parium_ was\r\ninterposed as a barrier against prosecutions instituted by the king, not\r\nagainst appeals of private individuals. Pleas following upon accusations\r\nby the injured party were held in 1471 not to fall within the words of\r\nMagna Carta.[817] This was a serious limitation; but as against the\r\nCrown the scope of the protection afforded by the Great Charter was very\r\nwide indeed. Care was taken that the three-fold safeguard should cover\r\nevery form of abuse likely to be practised by John.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 817:\r\n\r\n  See, _e.g._, Pike, _House of Lords_, 217, citing Littleton in _Year\r\n  Book_, Easter, 10 Edward IV., No. 17, fo. 6.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(1) _Capiatur vel imprisonetur._ If these two words were literally\r\ninterpreted, and the provision they embody strictly enforced, all\r\norderly government would be at an end. When a crime has been committed,\r\nthe offender must be arrested and provisionally detained, without\r\nwaiting for any judgment, whether of peers or otherwise. A man accused\r\nof crime may, indeed, justly demand three things: a trial before\r\ncondemnation, that the trial be not too long delayed, and that under\r\nsome circumstances he should be meanwhile released on bail. Magna Carta\r\ngoes further, promising complete exemption from arrest until judgment\r\nhad been passed upon him. Here the barons extorted a wider concession\r\nthan could possibly be enforced. Their excess of caution had led them to\r\nuse a loose and dangerously wide phrase, which ought not to be too\r\nliterally interpreted.[818]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 818:\r\n\r\n  If “_vel_” might be translated by “and” and “_imprisonetur_” by\r\n  “detained in gaol,” the phrase would then mean that no freeman should\r\n  be kept too long in prison pending his trial, or permanently\r\n  imprisoned without trial.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(2) _Aut disseisiatur._ Avarice was one of the most frequent motives of\r\nJohn’s oppressions: the whole machinery of justice was valued primarily\r\nas an engine for transferring land and money to his treasury. Crown\r\ntenants frequently found their estates appropriated by the Crown as\r\nescheats. That this was one of their grievances to which the barons\r\nattached supreme importance is shown in many ways: by the care taken in\r\nthe 25th of the Articles of the Barons and in chapter 52 of the Charter\r\nto provide procedure for restoring to their rightful owners estates of\r\nwhich they had been improperly “disseised,”[819] and by the terms of\r\ncertain writs issued by John after the treaty at Runnymede, for example\r\nthe letter of 19th June to his half-brother, the Earl of Salisbury,\r\nexplaining that peace had been made on condition of the immediate\r\nrestoration of all “lands, castles, and franchises from which we have\r\ncaused any one to be disseised _injuste et sine judicio_.”[820]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 819:\r\n\r\n  For this word cf. _supra_, c. 18. The treaty entered into by John in\r\n  1191 (discussed _infra_) speaks of the “disseisin of chattels,”\r\n  showing that the word had not yet been absolutely restricted to real\r\n  estate.\r\n\r\nFootnote 820:\r\n\r\n  See _Rot. Claus._, I. 215. Mr. Pike (_House of Lords_, p. 170)\r\n  maintains, indeed, that the prevention of disseisins “_sine judicio_”\r\n  was the chief, if not the sole, object of the chapter under\r\n  discussion:—“The judgment of peers had reference chiefly to the right\r\n  of landholders to their lands, or to some matters connected with\r\n  feudal tenure and its incidents.” This goes too far: the barons by no\r\n  means confined the safeguard afforded by the _judicium parium_ to\r\n  questions of land and land-tenure. Pollock and Maitland, I. 393,\r\n  countenance a broader interpretation. One point is beyond doubt:\r\n  _judicium parium_ extended to the assessing of amercements. In c. 21\r\n  earls and barons are confirmed in the right to be amerced only _per\r\n  pares suos_.\r\n\r\nLater versions of Magna Carta (beginning with that of 1217) are careful\r\nto define the objects to be protected from disseisin: “free tenements,\r\nfranchises, and free customs.”[821] (_a_) _Liberum tenementum._ “Free”\r\ntenements were freeholds as opposed to the holdings of villeins. None of\r\ntheir belongings thus protected were more highly valued by the barons\r\nthan their feudal strongholds.[822] Castles claimed by great lords as\r\ntheir own property are mentioned in many writs of the period—for\r\nexample, in that to the Earl of Salisbury already cited—while chapter 52\r\nof Magna Carta gives them a prominent place among the “disseisins” to be\r\nrestored. (_b_) “_Libertates_” covered feudal rights and incidents of\r\ntoo intangible nature to be appropriately described as “holdings.” In a\r\nsense, all the rights secured by Magna Carta were “liberties”; but the\r\nword is probably used here as equivalent to “franchises,” embracing\r\nfeudal jurisdictions, immunities, and privileges of various sorts, all\r\ntreated by medieval law as falling within the category of “property.”\r\n(_c_) _Consuetudines_ had two meanings, a broad general one and a\r\nnarrower financial one.[823] As the Charter of 1217 uses a proprietary\r\npronoun (no freeman shall be disseised of _his_ free customs), it\r\nprobably refers to such rights as those of levying tolls and tallages.\r\nThese vested interests were of the nature of monopolies throughout the\r\nterritory of the lord who enjoyed them; and it follows that Coke, in\r\ntreating this passage as a text on which to preach the doctrine that\r\nmonopolies have always been illegal in England, aims unusually wide of\r\nhis mark. Commenting on the words “_de libertatibus_,” he declares that\r\n“generally all monopolies are against this great charter, because they\r\nare against the liberty and freedom of the subject and against the law\r\nof the land.”[824] In this error he has been assiduously followed.[825]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 821:\r\n\r\n  _De libero tenemento suo vel libertatibus vel liberis consuetudinibus\r\n  suis._\r\n\r\nFootnote 822:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, p. 176.\r\n\r\nFootnote 823:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, p. 290.\r\n\r\nFootnote 824:\r\n\r\n  _Second Institute_, p. 47.\r\n\r\nFootnote 825:\r\n\r\n  See, _e.g._, Creasy, _Hist. of Const._, p. 151, n.: “Monopolies in\r\n  general are against the enactments of the Great Charter.” See also\r\n  Taswell-Langmead, _Eng. Const. Hist._, 108.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(3) _Aut utlagetur, aut exuletur, aut aliquo modo destruatur._ The\r\npractice of placing outside the protection of the law such evildoers as\r\ncould not be brought to justice had its origin in those early days when\r\nthe existing machinery of law was inadequate to the work required of it.\r\nWith the progress of order and organization, the criminal’s chances of\r\nevading justice became fewer; and the declaration of outlawry, which\r\ncould only be made in the county court, tended to become a mere\r\nformality, preliminary to the forfeiture of the outlaw’s lands and\r\ngoods. The expedient was one which recommended itself peculiarly to\r\nJohn’s genius; it was his deliberate policy to terrify those with whom\r\nhe had quarrelled, until they fled the country; then to summon them\r\nthree times before the county court to answer the charges against them,\r\nknowing well that they dared not face his corrupt and servile officers;\r\nand finally to have them formally outlawed and their property seized.\r\nSuch had been the fate suffered by two of the baronial leaders, Robert\r\nFitz Walter and Eustace de Vesci, in the autumn of 1212.[826] Outlawry\r\nwas not always, however, a mere formality in John’s reign. The man who\r\nhad been outlawed was outside the pale of society; anyone might slay him\r\nat pleasure; in the grim phrase of the day, he bore \"a wolf’s head\"\r\n(_caput lupinum_), and might be hunted like a noxious beast. A reward of\r\ntwo marks was offered for each outlaw’s head brought to Westminster.\r\nThis sum was paid in 1196 for the head of William of Elleford.[827] The\r\nword “exiled” explains itself; and commentators have very properly noted\r\nthe care taken to widen the scope of the clause by the use of the words\r\n“or in any other way molested.”[828]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 826:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, p. 30.\r\n\r\nFootnote 827:\r\n\r\n  See _Pipe Rolls_, 7 Richard I., cited by Madox, I. 201.\r\n\r\nFootnote 828:\r\n\r\n  _E.g._, Coke, _Second Institute_, p. 48.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(4) “_Nec super eum ibimus, nec super eum mittemus._” These words have\r\nbeen frequently misinterpreted. They must be viewed in the light of the\r\nhistorical incidents of the immediately preceding years; and, so read,\r\nthey present no difficulties, and leave no room for ambiguity. Their\r\nobject was to prevent John from substituting violence for legal process;\r\nfrom taking the law into his own hands and “going against them” with an\r\narmy at his back, or “sending against them” in similar wise. He must\r\nnever again attack _per vim et arma_ men unjudged and uncondemned.\r\n\r\nThe meaning is plain. Yet Coke, following his vicious method of assuming\r\nthe existence, in some part of Magna Carta, of a warrant for every legal\r\nprinciple established in his own day, has utterly misled several\r\ngenerations of commentators. He maintained that what John promised was\r\nto refrain from raising in his own courts actions in which he was\r\npersonally interested. In elaborating this error, he drew a fine\r\ndistinction between the court of King’s Bench, otherwise known as _coram\r\nrege_, because the king was always in theory present there, and other\r\ncourts in which were present only those to whom he had delegated\r\nauthority by a writ “sent” to it. _Ibimus_, he seems to think, applied\r\nin the former case; _mittemus_ in the latter. To quote his own words,\r\n\"No man shall be condemned at the king’s suit, either before the king in\r\nhis bench, where the pleas are _coram rege_ (and so are the words, _nec\r\nsuper eum ibimus_, to be understood) nor before any other commissioner,\r\nor judge whatsoever (and so are the words, _nec super eum mittemus_, to\r\nbe understood), but by the judgment of his peers, that is, equals, or\r\naccording to the law of the land.\"[829] Coke is completely in error; it\r\nwas the use of brute force, not merely a limited form of legal process,\r\nwhich John in these words renounced.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 829:\r\n\r\n  See _Second Institute_, page 46. John Reeves, _History of English\r\n  Law_, I. 249 (third ed.), while condemning Coke, gives an even more\r\n  strained interpretation of his own, founded on the chance\r\n  juxtaposition of the two verbs in one passage of the Digest. On quite\r\n  inconclusive grounds he draws the inference that both words refer\r\n  exclusively to diligence against \"goods and chattels\"—diligence\r\n  against the person, and diligence against landed estate having\r\n  previously been treated in words specially appropriate to each of them\r\n  respectively. Dr. Lingard, _History of England_, III. c. 1, deserves\r\n  praise as the first commentator who took the correct view.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIII. _What Classes of Men enjoyed the Protection of Judicium Parium?_ No\r\n“freeman” was to be molested in any of the ways specified; but how far\r\nin the social scale did this description descend? Coke claims the\r\nvilleins as free for the purposes of this chapter and of chapter I.,\r\nwhile rejecting them for the purposes of chapter 20.[830] His right to\r\nthe status of a freeman has already been disallowed,[831] and any\r\npossible ambiguity as to his share in the benefits of the present\r\nchapter is removed by the deliberate words of the revised version of\r\n1217. Chapter 35 of that reissue, with the object of making its meaning\r\nclearer, inserts after “_disseisiatur_” the words (already discussed)\r\n“_de libero tenemento suo vel libertatibus vel liberis consuetudinibus\r\nsuis_.” Mr. Prothero suggests that this addition implies an advance on\r\nthe privileges secured in 1215:—\"It is worth while to notice that the\r\nwords in which these liberties are stated in §35 of the charter of 1217\r\nare considerably fuller and clearer than the corresponding declaration\r\nin the charter of 1215.\"[832] It is safer to infer that no change was\r\nhere intended, but merely the removal of ambiguity. If there is a change\r\nit is rather a contraction than an extension, making it clear that only\r\n“free” tenements are protected, and excluding carefully the property of\r\nvilleins and even holdings of _villenagium_ (or unfree land) belonging\r\nto freemen.[833] Care was thus taken to make it plain beyond any\r\nreasonable doubt that no villein should have part or lot in rights\r\nhailed by generations of commentators as the national heritage of all\r\nEnglishmen.[834]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 830:\r\n\r\n  _Second Institute_, pp. 4, 27, and 45.\r\n\r\nFootnote 831:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, c. 20.\r\n\r\nFootnote 832:\r\n\r\n  _Simon de Montfort_, 17, n. Cf. Blackstone, _Great Charter_, xxxvii.,\r\n  “the more ample provision against unlawful disseisins.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 833:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Pollock and Maitland, I. 340, n.\r\n\r\nFootnote 834:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, p. 142. Other verbal changes in the charter of 1217 show\r\n  the same care to exclude the villeins. _E.g._ c. 16 leaves the king’s\r\n  demesne villeins strictly “in his mercy,” that is, liable to\r\n  amercement without any reservation.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIV. _Reactionary Side of these Provisions._ To insist rigorously that in\r\nall cases a judgment of feudal peers, either in King’s Court or in Court\r\nBaron, should take the place of a judgment by the officials of the\r\nCommon Bench and the King’s Bench, was to reverse one of the outstanding\r\nfeatures of the policy of Henry II. In this respect, the present chapter\r\nmay be read in connection with chapter 34. The barons, indeed, were not\r\nstrict logicians, and probably thought it prudent to claim more than\r\nthey intended to enforce.[835] Yet a real danger lurked in these\r\nprovisions; the clause was, after all allowance has been made, a\r\nreactionary one, tending to the restoration of feudal privileges and\r\nfeudal jurisdictions, inimical alike to the Crown and to the growth of\r\nreally popular liberties. John promised that feudal justice (as before\r\nthe reforms of his father) should be dispensed in feudal courts; and, if\r\nthis promise had been kept, the result would have been to check the\r\ndevelopment of the small committees destined to become at no distant\r\ndate the Courts of King’s Bench and Common Pleas, and to revive the\r\nfast-waning jurisdictions of the manorial courts on the one hand and of\r\nthe _commune concilium_ on the other.[836]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 835:\r\n\r\n  Mr. G. H. Blakesley in an able article in the _Law Quarterly Review_,\r\n  V. 125, goes so far as to reduce the entire chapter to an attempt to\r\n  protect feudal justice in its struggle with royal justice. \"It may\r\n  reasonably be suspected that cap. 39 also was directed merely to\r\n  maintain the lord’s court against Crown encroachments.\"\r\n\r\nFootnote 836:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Pike, _House of Lords_, 170–4, shares this view of the reactionary\r\n  nature of the clause, although he considers that the claim to\r\n  _judicium parium_ by a Crown tenant might be satisfied by the presence\r\n  of one or more fellow barons among the judges of the “Benches,” and\r\n  did not necessarily involve a full meeting of the _commune concilium_\r\n  summoned in the accustomed way. _Ibid._, p. 204. If the “judgment” of\r\n  the full court was requisite (and, in spite of the high authority of\r\n  Mr. Pike, there is much to be said for that contention), then the\r\n  reactionary feudal tendency is even more prominent. This feudal\r\n  tendency is emphasized by the consideration that private franchises\r\n  and private castles bulked prominently among the rights of property\r\n  protected from arbitrary seizure by the king.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nV. _The Genesis of the Chapter._ The interpretation here given of this\r\nfamous chapter is emphasized by a comparison of its words with certain\r\nearlier documents and events. The reigns of Richard and John furnish\r\nabundant examples of the abuses complained of. In 1191 Prince John, as\r\nleader of the opposition against his brother’s Chancellor, William\r\nLongchamp, concluded a treaty protecting himself and his allies from the\r\nvery evils which John subsequently committed against his own barons. The\r\nwords of this treaty of 1191 admirably bring out what Richard’s barons\r\nsought to secure, and what they sought to escape. Longchamp conceded in\r\nRichard’s name that the bishops and abbots, earls and barons,\r\n“vavassors” and free-tenants, should not be disseised of their lands and\r\nchattels at the will of the justices or ministers of the king, but that\r\nthey should be dealt with by judgment of the king’s court according to\r\nthe lawful customs and assizes, or by the king’s command.[837] The\r\nmagnates were not to be judged by officials whom they despised as their\r\nsocial inferiors and mistrusted as the paid instruments of royal\r\ntyranny; their claim to be tried by their equals in the king’s court was\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 837:\r\n\r\n  See R. Hoveden, III. 136. This truce, which was dated 28th July, 1191,\r\n  had been brought about by the mediation of the archbishop of Rouen and\r\n  of certain of the English prelates.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNow, the main subject of the arbitration, ending in the treaty from\r\nwhich this excerpt has been taken, was the custody of certain castles\r\nand estates. After the right to occupy each separate castle in dispute\r\nhad been carefully determined, provision was then made, in the general\r\nwords cited above, against this arrangement being disturbed without a\r\njudgment of the _curia regis_. Disseisin, and particularly disseisin of\r\ncastles, was thus in 1191, as in 1215, a topic of special prominence.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1213 the king attempted to take vengeance upon his opponents in\r\na manner which they are not likely to have forgotten two years later at\r\nRunnymede, and which probably influenced the wording of the present\r\nchapter. John, resenting bitterly the attitude of the northern barons\r\nwho had refused alike to accompany him to Poitou and to pay scutage,\r\ndetermined to take the law into his own hands. Without summoning his\r\nopponents before a _commune concilium_ of his feudal tenants, without\r\neven a trial and sentence by one of his Benches, without making any\r\neffort to investigate the justice or injustice of their pleas for\r\nrefusing, he set out with an army to punish them. He had gone as far\r\nnorth as Northampton on his mission of vengeance when he was overtaken\r\nby the archbishop of Canterbury, a strong advocate of conciliation. On\r\n28th August, 1213, Stephen Langton persuaded the king to defer forcible\r\nproceedings _until he had obtained a legal sentence_ in a formal\r\n_Curia_.[838] That John once again threatened recourse to violent\r\nmethods may be safely inferred from the words of a letter patent issued\r\nin May, 1215, when both sides were armed for war. He proposed\r\narbitration, and promised a truce until the arbitrators had given their\r\naward. The words of this promise are notable; since, not only do they\r\nillustrate the procedure of August, 1213, but they agree closely with\r\nthe clause of Magna Carta under discussion. The words are:—“Know that we\r\nhave conceded to our _barons_ who are against us, that we shall not take\r\nor disseise them or their men, nor shall we go against them _per vim vel\r\nper arma_, unless by the law of our kingdom, or by the judgment of their\r\npeers _in curia nostra_.”[839] Magna Carta repeats this concession in\r\nmore general terms, substituting “freemen” for the “barons” of the\r\nwrit—an alteration which necessitated the omission from the charter of\r\nthe concluding words of the writ, “_in curia nostra_”; because the peers\r\nof freemen, other than barons, would be found, not among the barons in\r\nthe king’s court, but among the freeholders in the court baron.[840]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 838:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, p. 35.\r\n\r\nFootnote 839:\r\n\r\n  The writ is dated 10th May, 1215, and appears in _New Rymer_, I. 128.\r\n\r\nFootnote 840:\r\n\r\n  Magna Carta also omits as unnecessary “_per vim et arma_,” though the\r\n  Articles of the Barons had contained the word “_vi_.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe words of Magna Carta, taken in connection with the treaty of 1191\r\nand the writ of 1213, are thus seen to have a narrower meaning than that\r\nextracted from them by subsequent commentators.\r\n\r\nVI. _Later History of “Judgment of Peers.”_ The claim made by the barons\r\nat Runnymede was re-asserted in somewhat varying forms by the same\r\nbarons or by their descendants on many subsequent occasions. The\r\n“_judicium parium_” was destined to enjoy a long and brilliant career,\r\nand the interpretations put upon it by the Crown and by the opposition\r\nrespectively, while interesting in themselves, afford strong\r\nconfirmation of the somewhat restricted estimate of the scope of the\r\npresent chapter, which has been above enunciated.\r\n\r\n(1) _The baronial contention._ The earls and barons, throughout the\r\nreign of John’s unhappy son, attempted to place a broad interpretation\r\non the privilege secured to them by this chapter—claiming that all\r\npleas, civil and criminal (such at least as were raised against them at\r\nthe instance of the Crown) should be tried by their fellow earls and\r\nbarons, and not by professional judges of lower rank.\r\n\r\n(2) _The royal contention._ The Crown, on the other hand, while not\r\nopenly infringing the charter, tried to narrow its scope. The judges\r\nappointed by the king to determine pleas _coram rege_, no matter what\r\ntheir original status might be, became (so the Crown argued) by such\r\nappointment, the peers of any baron or earl. This doctrine was\r\nenunciated in 1233 when Henry III. and his justiciar, Peter des Roches,\r\ndenounced Richard, Earl Marshal, as a traitor, in a meeting\r\n(_colloquium_) of Crown tenants held at Gloucester on 14th August of\r\nthat year. Thereafter, “_absque judicio curiae suae et parium suorum_,”\r\nas Matthew Paris carefully relates,[841] Henry treated earl Richard and\r\nhis friends as outlaws, and bestowed their lands on his own Poitevin\r\nfavourites. An attempt was made, at a subsequent meeting held on 9th\r\nOctober, to have these proceedings reversed on the ground, already\r\nstated, that they had taken place _absque judicio parium suorum_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 841:\r\n\r\n  _Chron. Maj._, III. 247-8.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe sequel makes clear a point left vague in Matthew’s narrative: there\r\nhad been a judgment previous to the seizure, but only a judgment of\r\nCrown officials _coram rege_, not of earls and barons in the _commune\r\nconcilium_. The justiciar defended the action of the government by a\r\nstriking argument: “there were no peers in England, such as were in the\r\nkingdom of France,” and, therefore, John might employ his justices to\r\ncondemn all ranks of traitors.[842] Bishop Peter was here seeking to\r\nevade the provisions of Magna Carta without openly defying them, and his\r\nline of argument was that the king’s professional judges, however lowly\r\nborn, were the peers of an English earl or baron.[843] Neither the royal\r\nview nor the baronial view entirely prevailed. A distinction, however,\r\nmust be drawn between criminal and civil pleas.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 842:\r\n\r\n  M. Paris, _Ibid._, III. 251-2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 843:\r\n\r\n  Pollock and Maitland, I. 393, hesitate to condemn this argument. \"The\r\n  very title of the ‘barons’ of the Exchequer forbids us to treat this\r\n  as mere insolence.\" Dr. Stubbs has no such scruples: “The Bishop\r\n  replied contemptuously, and with a perverse misrepresentation of the\r\n  English law” (_Const. Hist._, II. 49). Elsewhere he makes him, not so\r\n  much contemptuous, as ill-informed of the law—“ignorant blunder as it\r\n  was” (II. 191). Yet Bishop Peter had presumably a more intimate\r\n  knowledge of the law he administered as justiciar in 1233 than any\r\n  modern writer can have. In the matter of amercements, at least, the\r\n  barons of the exchequer acted as the peers of earls and barons.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(3) _Criminal pleas._ Offenders of the rank of barons partially made\r\ngood their claim to a trial by equals; while all other classes failed. A\r\nfurther distinction is thus necessary. (_a_) _Crown tenants._ The\r\nconflicting views held by king and baronage here resulted in a\r\ncompromise. In criminal pleas, the Crown was obliged to recede from the\r\nhigh ground taken by Peter des Roches in 1233. Unwillingly, and with an\r\nattempt to disguise the fact of surrender by confusing the issue,\r\nBracton in theory and Henry III. in practice admitted part of the\r\nbarons’ demand, namely, “that in cases of alleged treason and felony,\r\nwhen forfeiture or escheat was involved, they should be judged only by\r\nearls and barons.”[844] This concession was by no means based on the\r\nbroad ground taken by the Charter. Bracton does not admit that the\r\nking’s justices were not “peers” of barons; but deduces their disability\r\nfrom the narrower consideration that the king, through his officials,\r\nought not to be judge in his own behalf, since his interests in escheats\r\nmight bias his judgment. This is the reason why, from Bracton’s day to\r\nour own, “the privilege of peers,” which gradually assumed its modern\r\nform, has never extended to misdemeanours, since such convictions never\r\ninvolved forfeiture or escheat to the Crown.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 844:\r\n\r\n  Pike, _House of Lords_, 173. See also Bracton, f. 119; Pollock and\r\n  Maitland, I. 393.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe manner of giving effect to this concession is noteworthy. The\r\n_judicium parium_ was secured to earls and barons in later reigns, not\r\nmerely by giving seats on the judicial bench to a few holders of\r\n“baronies,” but by bringing the case before the entire body of earls and\r\nbarons in _commune concilium_. What the barons got at first was\r\n“judgment” by peers. The actual “trial” was the “battle,” the\r\nfellow-peers acting as umpires and enforcing fair play.[845] Although\r\nnew modes of procedure came to prevail, the Court of Peers continued its\r\ncontrol, and the _judgment_ of peers gradually passed into the modern\r\n_trial_ by peers.[846] The subject has been further complicated by the\r\ngradual growth of the modern conception of a “peerage,” embracing\r\nvarious grades of “nobles.” In essentials, however, the rights of a\r\nbaron (or of any magnate of higher grade) accused of crime have remained\r\nunchanged from the days of Henry III. to our own. The privilege of\r\n“trial by peers,” whatever the reason underlying it, still extends to\r\ntreason and felony, and is still excluded from misdemeanours. When\r\ncompetent it still takes place before a \"Court of Peers\"—namely, the\r\nHouse of Lords if Parliament is in session, and the Court of the Lord\r\nHigh Steward if not. Petty offences committed by peers, like those\r\ncommitted by commoners, come before the ordinary courts of law. Under\r\nthese limitations, then, the privilege of a peer to be tried only in the\r\nHouse of Lords (or in the Court of the Lord High Steward) has been for\r\ncenturies a reality in England for earls and barons, and also for\r\nmembers of those other ranks of the modern “peerage” unknown in\r\n1215—dukes, marquesses, and viscounts.[847]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 845:\r\n\r\n  “The trial, therefore—the ascertaining of the fact—was, though under\r\n  the direction and control of the Court of Peers, by battle; but the\r\n  judgment on the trial by battle was to be given by the peers.” Pike,\r\n  _House of Lords_, 174.\r\n\r\nFootnote 846:\r\n\r\n  Pike, _Ibid._, 174–9.\r\n\r\nFootnote 847:\r\n\r\n  The privilege was extended to peeresses by the statute 20 Henry VI. c.\r\n  9.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(_b_) _For tenants of a mesne lord_, however, no similar privilege has\r\nbeen established, even in a restricted form. In charges of felony, as in\r\nthose of misdemeanour, all freemen outside the peerage are tried, and\r\nhave been tried for many centuries past, in the ordinary courts of law.\r\nThere is no privileged treatment for the knight or the landed gentleman.\r\nAll are judged in the same tribunals and by the same procedure. Private\r\nfeudal courts never recovered from the wounds inflicted by Henry II. The\r\nclauses of Magna Carta which sought to revive them were rendered\r\nnugatory by legal fictions or simply by neglect.\r\n\r\n(4) _Civil pleas._ Various attempts were made by the barons as a class,\r\nor by its influential members, to make good a claim to _judicium parium_\r\nin civil cases.[848] The chief anxiety, perhaps, of the men of 1215 was\r\nto save their estates and castles from disseisin consequent on such\r\npleas. Yet the barons’ efforts in this direction were entirely\r\nunsuccessful. The House of Lords (except in cases involving the dignity\r\nor status of a peer) has never claimed to act as a court of first\r\ninstance in civil cases to which a peer was a party. Noble and commoner\r\nare here perfectly on a level. No “peer of the realm” has for many\r\ncenturies asked to plead before a special court of his peers in any\r\nordinary non-criminal litigation, whether affecting his real or his\r\npersonal estate.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 848:\r\n\r\n  The Earl of Chester claimed it in 1236-7, and the Earl of Gloucester\r\n  (in a special form as a lord marcher) in 1281. See Pollock and\r\n  Maitland, I. 393, n.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nVII. _Erroneous Interpretations._ The general tendency to vagueness and\r\nexaggeration has already been incidentally discussed. Two mistakes of\r\nunusual persistence require more detailed notice.\r\n\r\n(1) _The identification of_ judicium parium _with trial by jury_. The\r\nwords of the present chapter form the main, if not the sole, ground on\r\nwhich this traditional error has been based.[849] The mistake probably\r\nowes its origin to a not unnatural tendency of later generations of\r\nlawyers to explain what was unfamiliar in the Great Charter by what was\r\nfamiliar in their own experience. They found nothing in their own day to\r\ncorrespond with the _judicium parium_ of 1215, so far at least as\r\naffected those who were not Crown tenants; they found nothing in Magna\r\nCarta (unless it were this clause) to correspond with their own trial by\r\njury: therefore they identified the two, interpreting the present\r\nchapter as a general guarantee of the right to trial by jury.[850] Mr.\r\nReeves, Dr. Gneist, and other writers long ago exposed this error, but\r\nthe most conclusive refutations are those recently given by Prof.\r\nMaitland and Mr. Pike. The arguments by which these writers prove that\r\n“judgment by peers” is one thing and the “verdict of a jury” quite a\r\ndifferent thing are of a somewhat technical nature;[851] but as their\r\nimportance is far-reaching they must be explained, however briefly. They\r\nseem to be mainly three in number:\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 849:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, pp. 158-163.\r\n\r\nFootnote 850:\r\n\r\n  The erroneous identification of judgment of peers with trial by jury\r\n  can be found far back in legal history. Pollock and Maitland, II.\r\n  622-3, n., trace it to within a century of Magna Carta. \"This mistake\r\n  is being made already in Edward I.’s day; Y. B. 30-1 Edward I., p.\r\n  531.“ In spite of modern research the error dies hard. It appears,\r\n  _e.g._, in Thomson, _Magna Charta_, 223, and in Taswell-Langmead,\r\n  _Const. Hist._, 110. It was repeated only the other day by so high an\r\n  authority as Dr. Goldwin Smith in his recently published work, ”_The\r\n  United Kingdom_,\" I. 127, where he maintains that chapter 39 of Magna\r\n  Carta “affirms the right of trial by jury.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 851:\r\n\r\n  Pollock and Maitland, I. 152, n., and Pike, House of Lords, 169.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(_a_) The criminal petty jury cannot here be intended, since it had not\r\nbeen invented in 1215:[852] to introduce trial by jury into John’s great\r\nCharter is an unpardonable anachronism. (_b_) The barons would have\r\nrepudiated trial by jury if they had known it. They desired (here as in\r\nchapter 21) that all questions affecting them should be “judged” before\r\nfellow barons, and in the normal case, by the _duellum_. They would have\r\nscorned to submit to the verdict of “twelve good men” of their own\r\nlocality. Their inferiors must have no voice in determining their guilt\r\nor innocence. This sentiment was shared by the tenants of mesne lords.\r\n(_c_) _Judgment_ and _verdict_ were essentially different. The function\r\nof a petty jury (after it _had_ been invented) was to answer the\r\nspecific question put to it. The insurgent barons demanded more than\r\nthis: they asked a decision on the whole case.[853] The “peers” who\r\njudged presided over the proceedings from beginning to end, appointing\r\nthe proof they deemed appropriate, sitting as umpires while its\r\nfulfilment was essayed, and giving a final decision as to success or\r\nfailure therein.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 852:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, p. 161.\r\n\r\nFootnote 853:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Pike, _Ibid._, 169. “From the time when trial by jury first\r\n  commenced, either in civil or in criminal cases, to this present end\r\n  of the nineteenth century, no jury ever did or could give judgment on\r\n  any matter whatsoever.” The difference between the ancient and modern\r\n  conceptions of judgment, however, must not be lost sight of.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(2) _Magna Carta and arbitrary commitment._ A second erroneous theory\r\nhas still to be discussed. The Petition of Right, as already stated,\r\ntreats Magna Carta as prohibiting the Crown from making arrests without\r\na warrant showing the cause of detention; and the earlier commentators\r\nfurther interpreted it as making all acts of arbitrary imprisonment by\r\nthe Crown absolutely illegal, although strong reasons of state might\r\nurge the detention of dangerous individuals. Hallam, for example,\r\ndeclares that from the era \"of King John’s Charter, it must have been a\r\nclear principle of our institutions that no man can be detained in\r\nprison without trial.\" Yet every king of England from the days of John\r\nLackland to those of Charles Stewart, claimed and exercised the\r\nprerogative of summarily committing to gaol any man suspected of evil\r\ndesigns against the Crown or Commonwealth. Strong kings used this power\r\nfreely to remove those whom they wished to silence. Frequently no cause\r\nof arrest was mentioned, no explanation given, except the words \"by the\r\nking’s command.\" During all these centuries the legality of such\r\nprocedure was never challenged as contrary to Magna Carta, or on any\r\nother ground. Even the famous protest of the judges of Queen Elizabeth,\r\nasserting the existence of legal limits to the royal prerogative of\r\ncommitment, proves the lawfulness of the general practice to which it\r\nmakes comparatively insignificant exceptions. Such rights inherent in\r\nthe Crown, dangerous undoubtedly to liberty but yet perfectly legal,\r\nwere never seriously challenged until the struggle between Charles I.\r\nand his parliaments had fairly begun. Then it was that old precedents\r\nwere eagerly sought out and put to new uses. Then only was it suggested,\r\nfor the first time, that Magna Carta was intended to prohibit arbitrary\r\ncommitments at the command of the Crown. Such was the argument\r\ndeliberately put forth in 1627 during the famous proceedings known\r\nsometimes as Darnell’s case and sometimes as the case of the Five\r\nKnights. Heath, the Attorney-General, easily repelled this contention:\r\n“the law hath ever allowed this latitude to the king, or his privy\r\ncouncil, which are his representative body, in extraordinary cases to\r\nrestrain the persons of such freemen as for reasons of state they find\r\nnecessary for a time, without for this present expressing the causes\r\nthereof.”[854] The parliamentary leaders, however, too grimly in earnest\r\nto be deterred by logic, were far from abandoning their error because\r\nHeath had unanswerably exposed it. They embodied it, on the contrary, in\r\nthe Petition of Right, which condemned the Crown’s practice of\r\nimprisoning political offenders “without any cause showed” (or only _per\r\nspeciale mandatum regis_) as contrary to the tenor of Magna Carta—an\r\neffective contention as a political expedient, but essentially unsound\r\nin law.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 854:\r\n\r\n  See _State Trials_, III., p. 1, and S.

Gardiner, _History_, VI.\r\n  214.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER FORTY.\r\n\r\nNulli vendemus, nulli negabimus, aut differemus, rectum aut justiciam.\r\n\r\n  To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay, right or\r\n  justice.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis chapter, like the preceding one with which it is so closely\r\nconnected, has had much read into it by commentators which would have\r\nastonished its original framers. The application of modern standards to\r\nancient practice has resulted in a complete misapprehension. The sums\r\ncustomarily received by John, as by his predecessors, at every stage of\r\nlegal procedure, were not necessarily the wages of deliberate injustice.\r\nThis is evident from several considerations. Thus litigants paid fines\r\nfor redress against the Crown itself; in disputes between two private\r\nparties, the sum offered by the highest bidder was by no means always\r\naccepted; sometimes justice was rendered to one litigant gratis in spite\r\nof a heavy offer by the other. Many payments, then, were not bribes to\r\nan unjust judge, but merely expedients for hastening the law’s delays,\r\nor to ensure a fair hearing for a good plea, or to obtain some unusual\r\nbut not unfair expedient, such as a peculiarly potent writ or the\r\nhearing of a case in the exchequer, which would ordinarily have been\r\ntried elsewhere. If the royal courts charged higher rates for justice\r\nthan the feudal courts, they supplied a better article. When Henry of\r\nAnjou threw open the doors of his court to all freemen who chose to pay\r\nfor writs, he found a ready market. These writs differed widely in\r\nprice. Some from an early date were issued whenever applied for (writs\r\n_de cursu_) and at a fixed sum: others were granted only as marks of\r\nfavour or after a bargain had been struck. Specially quick or cogent\r\nprocedure had to be specially paid for. It would thus appear that the\r\nsystem of John was not open to the unqualified and violent condemnation\r\nwhich it usually receives. Hallam’s language is too sweeping when he\r\nsays: “A law which enacts that justice shall neither be sold, denied,\r\nnor delayed, stamps with infamy that government under which it had\r\nbecome necessary.”[855] It was John’s abuse of the system, not the\r\nsystem itself, which called for condemnation; and the worst that could\r\nbe said against it, according to medieval standards, was that it lent\r\nitself too readily to abuse.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 855:\r\n\r\n  _Middle Ages_, II. 451.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIf the barons really desired that John should continue to dispense royal\r\njustice in the new fields occupied by his father, but should do so\r\nwithout pecuniary return, their demands were unfair and even absurd; but\r\nprobably they only wished a strict adherence to the customary rules and\r\ncharges which they had come to expect as normal in connection with royal\r\ntribunals. The system, indeed, has many objectionable features to modern\r\ncritics; but in the twentieth century, as in the thirteenth, justice\r\ncannot be had for nothing; and the would-be litigant with a good claim\r\nbut a slender purse will be well advised to acquiesce in a small loss\r\nrather than incur the certainty of losing as much again in\r\nextra-judicial outlays, and the risk of losing many times more in the\r\njudicial expenses of a protracted litigation. The lack of free justice\r\nis a reproach which the men of to-day cannot with good grace fling at\r\nthe administration of John.\r\n\r\nAs the evils complained of are often exaggerated, so also are the\r\nreforms promised by this chapter of Magna Carta. John is usually held to\r\nhave agreed to the abolition of payments of every sort for judicial\r\nwrits and other fees of court. Justice, unlike other valuable\r\ncommodities, was, it would appear, to be obtained for nothing—an ideal\r\nnever yet attained in any civilized community. A body of highly trained\r\nclerks could not be kept by the king to issue writs gratuitously to all\r\nwho asked them, and a staff of judges, “who knew the law and meant to\r\nkeep it,” to determine pleas which would bring in no return to the\r\nCrown.\r\n\r\nThe intention of those who framed this chapter was probably to secure a\r\nmore moderate and reasonable measure of reform. Abuses of the system\r\nwere to be redressed.[856] Unfortunately it was not easy to define\r\nabuses—to determine where legitimate payments stopped and illegitimate\r\nones began. Prohibitive prices ought not to be charged for writs _de\r\ncursu_; but was the Crown to have no right to issue writs of grace on\r\nits own terms? Plaintiffs who had any special reason for haste\r\nfrequently paid to have their suits heard quickly: was that an\r\nabuse?[857]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 856:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Madox, I. 455, \"By _nulli vendemus_ were excluded the excessively\r\n  high fines: by _nulli negabimus_, the stopping of suits or\r\n  proceedings, and the denial of writs: by _nulli differemus_ such\r\n  delays as were before wont to be occasioned by the counterfines of\r\n  defendants (who sometimes would outbid the plaintiffs) or by the\r\n  prince’s will.\"\r\n\r\nFootnote 857:\r\n\r\n  Fines for this purpose were frequent under Henry II. and his sons.\r\n  Madox, I. 447, cites many examples. Thus in 1166 Ralph Fitz Simon paid\r\n  two marks “for speeding his right” (_pro recto suo festinando_). The\r\n  practice continued under Henry III. in spite of Magna Carta. Bracton’s\r\n  _Note Book_ cites a hard case (No. 743): Henry III. was claiming\r\n  prerogative wardship where it was illegal under c. 37 of Magna Carta\r\n  (_q. v._). The court might have delayed hearing the mesne lord’s plea\r\n  until the wardship was ended; but he paid five marks _pro festinando\r\n  judicio suo_. The fine was said to be given “willingly” (_sponte_).\r\n  Did the use of this word make possible an evasion of c. 40 of the\r\n  Charter?\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhatever the intention may have been, the practical effect of the clause\r\nwas _not_ to secure the abolition of the sale of writs and justice. The\r\npractice under Henry III. has been described by our highest authority.\r\n\"Apparently there were some writs which could be had for nothing; for\r\nothers a mark or a half-mark would be charged, while, at least during\r\nHenry’s early years, there were others which were only to be had at high\r\nprices. We may find creditors promising the king a quarter or a third of\r\nthe debts that they hope to recover. Some distinction seems to have been\r\ntaken between necessaries and luxuries. A royal writ was a necessary for\r\none who was claiming freehold; it was a luxury for the creditor exacting\r\na debt, for the local courts were open to him and he could proceed there\r\nwithout writ. Elaborate glosses overlaid the king’s promise that he\r\nwould sell justice to none, for a line between the price of justice and\r\nthose mere court fees, which are demanded even in our own day, is not\r\neasily drawn. That the poor should have their writs for nothing, was an\r\naccepted maxim.\"[858]\r\n\r\nProbably the practice before and after 1215 showed few material\r\ndifferences. Some of the more glaring abuses of the system were checked:\r\nthat was all.[859] Parliament in subsequent reigns had frequently to\r\npetition against the sale of justice in breach of Magna Carta.[860] The\r\nking usually returned a politic answer, but was careful never to\r\nsurrender his right to exact large sums for writs of grace. Richard II.,\r\nfor example, replied: “Our lord the king does not intend to divest\r\nhimself of so great an advantage, which has been continually in use in\r\nChancery as well before as after the making of the said charter, in the\r\ntime of all his noble progenitors who have been kings of England.”[861]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 858:\r\n\r\n  Pollock and Maitland, I. 174. Cf. _Ibid._, II. 204, and authorities\r\n  cited.\r\n\r\nFootnote 859:\r\n\r\n  Madox, I. 455, says: “And this clause in the great Charters seems to\r\n  have had its effect. For ... the fines which were paid for writs and\r\n  process of law were more moderate after the making of those great\r\n  Charters than they used to be before.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 860:\r\n\r\n  Instances are collected by Sir T. D. Hardy in _Rot. de oblatis_, p.\r\n  xxi. See also Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, II. 636-7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 861:\r\n\r\n  _Rot. Parl._, III. 116, cited Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, II. 637.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt is thus evident that Magna Carta did not put down the practice of\r\ncharging heavy fees for writs. Yet this chapter, although so frequently\r\nmisunderstood and exaggerated, is still of considerable importance. It\r\nmarks, for one thing, a stage in the process by which the king’s courts\r\ngradually outdistanced all rivals. In certain provinces, at least, royal\r\njustice was left in undisputed possession. In these the grievance was\r\nnot that there was too much royal justice, but that it was sometimes\r\ndelayed or denied. Here, then, even in the moment of John’s most bitter\r\nhumiliation we find evidence of the triumph of the policy of the Crown\r\ninaugurated half a century earlier by his far-seeing father.\r\n\r\nIt is not to such considerations as these, however, that this chapter\r\nowes the prominence usually given to it in legal treatises; but rather\r\nto the fact that it has been broadly interpreted as a universal\r\nguarantee of impartial justice to high and low; and because when so\r\ninterpreted it has become in the hands of patriots in many ages a\r\npowerful weapon in the cause of constitutional freedom. Viewing it in\r\nthis light, Coke throws aside his crabbed learning and concludes with\r\nwhat is rather a rhapsody than a lawyer’s commentary: “as the gold-finer\r\nwill not out of the dust, threads, or shreds of gold, let pass the least\r\ncrumb, in respect of the excellency of the metal; so ought not the\r\nlearned reader to pass any syllable of this law, in respect of the\r\nexcellency of the matter.”[862]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 862:\r\n\r\n  _Second Institute_, 56.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER FORTY-ONE.\r\n\r\nOmnes mercatores habeant salvum et securum exire de Anglia, et venire in\r\nAngliam, et morari et ire per Angliam, tam per terram quam per aquam, ad\r\nemendum et vendendum, sine omnibus malis toltis, per antiquas et rectas\r\nconsuetudines, preterquam in tempore gwerre, et si sint de terra contra\r\nnos gwerrina; et si tales inveniantur in terra nostra in principio\r\ngwerre, attachientur sine dampno corporum et rerum, donec sciatur a\r\nnobis vel capitali justiciario nostro quomodo mercatores terre nostre\r\ntractentur, qui tunc invenientur in terra contra nos gwerrina; et si\r\nnostri salvi sint ibi, alii salvi sint in terra nostra.\r\n\r\n  All merchants shall have safe and secure exit from England, and entry\r\n  to England, with the right to tarry there and to move about as well by\r\n  land as by water, for buying and selling by the ancient and right\r\n  customs, quit from all evil tolls, except (in time of war) such\r\n  merchants as are of the land at war with us. And if such are found in\r\n  our land at the beginning of the war, they shall be detained, without\r\n  injury to their bodies or goods, until information be received by us,\r\n  or by our chief justiciar, how the merchants of our land found in the\r\n  land at war with us are treated; and if our men are safe there, the\r\n  others shall be safe in our land.\r\n\r\n\r\nMerchants and merchandise, like all other classes and interests, had\r\nsuffered severely from John’s greed, unrestrained by regard for the\r\nrights of others. The control of commerce was specially reserved for the\r\nking’s personal supervision. No law or traditional usage trammelled him\r\nin his dealings with foreign merchants, who were dependent on royal\r\nfavour, not on the law of the land, for the privilege of trading and\r\neven for personal safety. No alien merchant could enter England or leave\r\nit, nor take up his abode in any town, nor move from place to place, nor\r\nbuy and sell, without paying heavy tolls to the king. This royal\r\nprerogative proved a profitable one.[863]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 863:\r\n\r\n  So far all authorities are agreed, though a difference of opinion\r\n  exists as to the source of these prerogatives. Thus (_a_) Stephen\r\n  Dowell, _History of Taxation and Taxes in England_, I. 75, considers\r\n  that the duties on imports and exports were in their origin of the\r\n  nature of voluntary dues paid by foreign merchants in return for\r\n  freedom of trade and royal protection; (_b_) Hubert Hall, _Customs\r\n  Revenue of England_, I. 58-62, considers the prerogative as merely one\r\n  aspect of purveyance, that is of the right of the king to requisition\r\n  what he required for his own needs and those of his household. Many\r\n  such “theories” are anachronisms. The prerogative was founded on\r\n  fact—on the brute force at the Crown’s disposal. Kings took what they\r\n  could, and left future ages to invent theories to justify or explain\r\n  their actions.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nJohn increased the number and amount of such exactions, to the detriment\r\nalike of foreign traders and of their customers. Magna Carta, therefore,\r\nsought to restrain this branch of prerogative, forbidding him to exact\r\nexcessive tolls for removing obstacles of his own creating. This\r\nbenefited the merchants by securing to them certain rights, which may\r\nperhaps be analysed into three: safe-conduct, that is protection of\r\ntheir persons and goods from violence; liberty to buy and sell in time\r\nof peace; and a confirmation of the ancient and just rates of “customs,”\r\nwith the abolition of John’s “evil tolls” or additional exactions.\r\n\r\nSo far, the general purport of the enactment is undoubted; but\r\ndiscussions have arisen on several important points, such as the\r\nnationality of the traders in whose favour it was conceived; the exact\r\nnature of the “evil tolls” abolished; the motives for the rules\r\nenforced; and the relations between denizens and foreign traders.\r\n\r\nI. _Magna Carta favours alien Merchants._ The better opinion would seem\r\nto be that this chapter applied primarily to foreign traders from\r\nfriendly states. Attempts have been made, indeed, to argue otherwise,\r\nnamely, that denizens were to benefit equally with strangers, Magna\r\nCarta holding the balance even between them. Such was the purport of a\r\nlearned discourse delivered in the House of Commons by William Hakewill,\r\nBarrister of Lincoln’s Inn, in 1610, during the debate on John Bate’s\r\ncase.[864] His main argument was that certain statutes of the reign of\r\nEdward III.,[865] in seeking to confirm and expand the provisions of\r\nMagna Carta, did clearly embrace denizens as well as aliens. Yet the\r\nframers of an Act in the fourteenth century may well have misunderstood\r\nthe tenor of John’s Charter, or may have deliberately altered it.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 864:\r\n\r\n  See _State Trials_, II. 407-475, and especially 455-6.\r\n\r\nFootnote 865:\r\n\r\n  _E.g._ 2 Edward III. c. 9 and 14 Edward III., stat. 1, c. 21.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIntrinsic and extrinsic evidences combine to create a strong presumption\r\nthat Magna Carta referred chiefly, perhaps exclusively, to merchants of\r\nforeign lands.[866] Denizens trading in England did not require those\r\n“safe conducts” which form the chief concession in this chapter; and\r\ntheir rights of buying and selling were already protected in another\r\nway; for independent traders were unknown, all merchants being banded\r\ninto guilds in the various towns whose privileges (“_omnes libertates et\r\nliberas consuetudines_”) were guaranteed to them in a previous part of\r\nthe great Charter.[867] It was the alien merchants who required special\r\nprotection, since they had, strictly speaking, no status in the eye of\r\nthe law, and held their privileges from the king, who, moving along the\r\nline of least resistance, frequently preferred to overtax them rather\r\nthan his own subjects.[868] The Crown might vouchsafe the protection\r\nthey needed either willingly or grudgingly, and under conditions to be\r\naltered at discretion, but never unless well paid for. The policy of\r\nHenry II. and his sons was to favour merchant strangers, but to exact in\r\nreturn the highest dues possible, restrained only by an enlightened\r\nself-interest which stopped short at the point where trade would\r\nlanguish by becoming unprofitable. The Exchequer Rolls and the Patent\r\nRolls afford many illustrations of how individual traders or families\r\nmade private bargains with the Crown for trading privileges. In 1181\r\nHenry obtained two falcons for granting leave to export corn to Norway.\r\nIn 1197, a certain Hugo Oisel owed 400 marks for licence to trade in\r\nEngland and in Richard’s other lands in time of war as well as of\r\npeace.[869]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 866:\r\n\r\n  Two-thirds of the chapter is occupied in explaining that merchant\r\n  strangers of unfriendly States are not to benefit from it. Mr.\r\n  Hakewill was aware of this, but sought to evade the natural inference\r\n  by subtleties which are not convincing.\r\n\r\nFootnote 867:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, under c. 13.\r\n\r\nFootnote 868:\r\n\r\n  For the legal position of aliens, see Pollock and Maitland, I.\r\n  441-450.\r\n\r\nFootnote 869:\r\n\r\n  See _Pipe Rolls_, 27 Henry II. and 8 Richard I., cited Madox, I.\r\n  467-8.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of John’s reign, traders resident in England seem\r\ncollectively to have obtained confirmation of their privileges. That\r\nking issued Letters Patent to the Mayor of London, to the magistrates of\r\nmany smaller towns, and to the sheriffs of the southern counties of\r\nEngland, directing them, in terms closely resembling those of Magna\r\nCarta, to allow to all merchants of whatsoever land safe coming and\r\ngoing, with their wares.[870]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 870:\r\n\r\n  See _Rot. Chart._, 60 (5th April, 1200).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThese arrangements were merely temporary. John did not intend that any\r\nsuch general grant should prevent him from exacting further payments\r\nfrom individuals as occasion offered. For example, Nicolas the Dane\r\npromised a hawk each time he entered England, that he might come and go\r\nand trade “free of all customs which pertain to the king.”[871] Such\r\ncustomary dues, at the usual rates, were not abolished by the Charter,\r\nbut only the arbitrary additional payments for which there was no\r\nwarrant.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 871:\r\n\r\n  See _Pipe Roll_, 6 John, cited Madox, I. 469, where other\r\n  illustrations will be found. Cf. also _Rot. Pat._, 170. 170_b_, 171,\r\n  172_b_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOn this point, then, Magna Carta contained no innovations, and the same\r\nis true of its provision for reprisals against traders from lands where\r\nEnglish merchants were ill-treated. On the outbreak of war the Charter\r\ndirects that merchants of the enemy’s nation should be detained until\r\nthe king ascertained how his own subjects were treated in the enemy’s\r\nterritory. This is merely declaratory of the previous practice, of which\r\nan illustration may be found in the terms of a writ of August, 1214,\r\nwhich directed the bailiffs of Southampton to detain all Flemings and\r\ntheir goods pending further instructions.[872] There were thus\r\nprecedents for those rules for foreign traders, which have aroused the\r\nadmiration of Montesquieu.[873]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 872:\r\n\r\n  In the same writ John bade them allow to depart freely all vessels of\r\n  the land of the Emperor or of the King of Scotland after taking\r\n  security that they would sail straight to their own countries and take\r\n  with them none but their own crews. See _Rot. Claus._, I. 211, and cf.\r\n  series of writs in I. 210.\r\n\r\nFootnote 873:\r\n\r\n  See _De l’Esprit des Lois II._ 12 (ed. of 1750, Edinburgh), “_La\r\n  grande chartre des Anglois défend de saisir et de confisquer en cas de\r\n  guerre les merchandises des négociants étrangers, à moins que ce ne\r\n  soit par représailles. Il est beau que la nation Angloise ait fait de\r\n  cela un des articles de sa liberté!_”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nII. _Customs and Tolls._ “_Consuetudines_” is in this passage used in\r\nits narrower financial sense, relating to those duties on imports and\r\nexports which are still specially called “customs” at the present day,\r\nand to various local dues as well. “Tolls” when not stigmatized as “evil\r\ntolls” would seem to be practically synonymous with these customs. The\r\nCrown had at first taken from the defencelessness of merchants,\r\nwhatever, on each occasion, it thought fit. Practice soon established\r\nrules as to the normal rates considered fair in various circumstances.\r\nWhen a ship-load of foreign wine arrived, the normal toll was “one cask\r\nfrom a cargo of ten up to twenty casks, and two casks from a cargo of\r\ntwenty or more.”[874] From other merchandise a share was claimed of a\r\nfifteenth or sometimes a tenth of the whole. Such tolls, if originally a\r\nspecies of blackmail, had in John’s day come to be regarded as a\r\nlegitimate branch of royal revenue. Any arbitrary increase, however, was\r\ncondemned by public opinion, and ultimately by Magna Carta, as a “_mala\r\ntolta_.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 874:\r\n\r\n  S. Dowell, _Hist. of Taxation_, I. 83, citing Madox, I. 525-9 [2nd ed.\r\n  I. 765-770], and _Liber Albus_, I. 247-8.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, however, that the king was not the only one who\r\nexacted tolls. Every town in England, and many feudal magnates, by\r\nprescriptive usage or by royal grant, levied payments on all goods\r\nbought or sold at various fairs and markets, or that entered the city\r\ngates, or were unloaded at river wharves, or traversed certain roads.\r\nThe ambition of every borough was to increase its own franchises at the\r\nexpense of its neighbours. The free customs of Bristol, for example,\r\nmeant not only that the men of that city should have freedom from tolls\r\ninflicted by others, but that they should have the right to inflict\r\ntolls upon those others. A whole network of such customs and\r\nrestrictions impeded the free exchange of commodities in every part of\r\nEngland. Magna Carta had no intention of sweeping these away, so far as\r\nthey were “just and ancient”; and it is probable that the prohibition\r\nagainst arbitrary increase of tolls was directed only against the Crown.\r\n\r\nIII. _The Motives prompting these Provisions._ It has been not unusual\r\nto credit the framers of Magna Carta with a liberal policy of quite a\r\nmodern flavour; they are made free-traders and credited with a knowledge\r\nof economic principles far in advance of their contemporaries. This is\r\nan entire misconception: Englishmen in the beginning of the thirteenth\r\ncentury had formulated no far-reaching theories of the rights of the\r\nconsumer, or the advantages of the policy of the open door. The home\r\ntraders were not consenting parties to this chapter, and would have\r\nbitterly resented any attempt to place foreigners on an equal footing\r\nwith the protected guilds of the English boroughs. The barons, in\r\ninserting this stipulation among the promises wrung from John, acted on\r\ntheir own initiative and from purely selfish motives. The rich nobles,\r\nboth lay and ecclesiastic, desired that nothing should prevent the\r\nforeign rivals of the insular burghers from importing the wines and rich\r\napparel which England could not produce. John, indeed, as a consumer of\r\ncontinental luxuries, partially shared their views, but his\r\nshort-sighted policy threatened to strangle foreign trade by gradually\r\nincreasing the burdens attached to it, until it ceased to be\r\nremunerative. The barons, therefore, in their own interests, not in\r\nthose of the foreign merchants, still less in those of native traders,\r\ndemanded that the custom duties should remain at their old fixed rates.\r\nIn adopting this attitude, they showed their selfish indifference to the\r\nequally selfish claims of English traders, who, jealous of foreigners\r\nalike in their home markets and in the carrying trade, desired a\r\nmonopoly for themselves. Every favour shown to foreign merchants was an\r\ninjury done to the guilds of the chartered boroughs. This chapter thus\r\nshows a lack of gratitude on the barons’ part for the great service\r\nrendered to their cause by their allies, the citizens of London. John,\r\non the other hand, would have little reluctance in punishing the men of\r\nhis capital who, with the ink scarce dry on their new municipal charter,\r\nhad not scrupled to desert his cause.[875] It must have been with grim\r\npleasure that, on 21st July, 1215, in strict conformity with the tenor\r\nof Magna Carta, he addressed a writ to King Philip inviting reprisals\r\nupon London merchants in France in certain contingencies.[876]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 875:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, 41–2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 876:\r\n\r\n  See _New Rymer_, I. 135: “Know that we have ordered the mayor and\r\n  sheriffs of London to allow merchants of your land to remove their\r\n  goods and chattels from London, without hindrance to doing thence\r\n  their will; and that if they do not, you may, if it please you, grieve\r\n  and molest the men of that town (_illius villae_) in your power,\r\n  without our reckoning it a breach of truce on your part.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn the reissue of 1216 the privileges conferred on merchant strangers\r\nwere confined to such as had not been “publicly prohibited beforehand.”\r\nThis was a material alteration, the effect of which was to restore to\r\nthe king full discretionary authority over foreign trade, since he had\r\nonly to issue a general proclamation, and then to accept fines for\r\ngranting exemption from its operation.\r\n\r\nIV. _English Boroughs and Merchant Strangers._ The quarrel between home\r\nand alien traders underwent many vicissitudes during several succeeding\r\ncenturies, the Crown taking now one side, and now the other, as its\r\npecuniary interests happened to dictate for the moment. No glimmerings\r\nof the doctrine of free trade can be traced: the merchants of each town,\r\nbanded in their guilds, directed their endeavours towards securing\r\nrights of exclusive trading for themselves. It is true that the men of\r\nLondon were scarcely more jealous of the privileges of the citizens of\r\nRouen or of Paris than of those of York or of Lincoln; their ambition\r\nwas to inflict restrictions upon all rivals alike. The _Liber\r\nCustumarum_, a compilation of the early thirteenth century, lays down\r\nminute rules for the regulation of foreign traders in London. The\r\nmerchant stranger had to take up his abode in the house of some citizen.\r\nHe was strictly prohibited from engaging in retail trade and from\r\npurchasing articles in process of manufacture. He could buy only from\r\nthose who had the freedom of the city, and could not re-sell the goods\r\nwithin the borough walls. He was allowed to sell only to burgesses of\r\nLondon, except on three specified days of the week. Such were a few of\r\nthe rules which the Londoners enforced on all traders within their\r\ngates. The king, however, intermittently encouraged foreigners. Under\r\nthe fostering protection of Henry III., Lombards and Provençals settled\r\nin considerable numbers in the capital; and with the connivance of the\r\nking, infringed these rules. When the Londoners complained, Henry\r\nrefused relief. Their loyalty thus shaken, they sided with the king’s\r\nopponents in the Barons’ War, and when the royalist cause triumphed at\r\nEvesham, the capital shared in the punishment meted out to the Crown’s\r\nopponents. Prince Edward in 1266 was nominated protector of foreign\r\nmerchants in England, whose cause was temporarily triumphant. At the\r\naccession of that Prince, London bought itself back into royal favour\r\nfor the time being. At the same period an attempt was made to define\r\nwhat tolls or customs might be taken by the Crown. In 1275, in Edward’s\r\nfirst parliament, a tariff was fixed by “the prelates, magnates, and\r\ncommunities at the request of the merchants” on most of what then formed\r\nthe staple exports of England: half a mark on every sack of wool, half a\r\nmark on every three hundred wool-fells (that is, untanned skins with the\r\nfleeces on), and one mark on every load of leather.\r\n\r\nThese were subsequently called _magna et antiqua custuma_, to\r\ndistinguish them from an additional fifty per cent., levied from foreign\r\nmerchants at a later date and known as _parva et nova custuma_. The\r\nsettlement of 1275 was by no means final. New disputes arose; and in\r\n1285 Edward I. confiscated the liberties of London, suppressed what he\r\ncharacterized as abuses, and favoured the aliens. In 1298 the franchises\r\nof the capital were restored, and very soon the abuses complained of\r\nbegan anew. Edward retorted in 1303 by a special ordinance known as the\r\n_carta mercatoria_ in favour of their foreign rivals, by the terms of\r\nwhich the provisions of the present chapter of Magna Carta became at\r\nlast a reality. This new charter, which was the result of a bargain\r\nstruck between the Crown and the alien traders, conferred various\r\nprivileges and exemptions in return for the increased rates of duty now\r\nimposed and known henceforth as _parva et nova custuma_. Edward I. made\r\nseveral attempts to exact the higher rates from denizens as well as from\r\nstrangers; but in this he failed. In 1309 a Petition of Parliament was\r\npresented against the exaction of the “new customs,” declaring them to\r\nbe in contravention of Magna Carta.\r\n\r\nIn 1311 a temporary community of economic and political interests\r\nresulted in an alliance between the English merchants and the English\r\nbaronage, whose combined efforts forced the “Ordinances” upon Edward\r\nII., compelling him for a time to reverse his father’s policy of\r\nfavouring foreigners at the expense of native merchants. It is\r\nunnecessary to follow the checkered fortunes of these Ordinances,\r\nfrequently enforced and as frequently abolished, according as the\r\nfortunes of the barons or of Edward II. were for the moment in the\r\nascendant. During the reign of Edward III. the deep-rooted quarrel\r\nbetween home and alien merchants continued; and many changes of policy\r\nwere adopted by the Crown. The statute of 1328 which abolished the\r\n“staples beyond the sea and on this side” provided “that all merchant\r\nstrangers and privy may go and come with their merchandises into\r\nEngland, after the tenor of the Great Charter.”[877] Seven years later\r\nthis was confirmed by an act which in considerable detail placed\r\nstrangers and denizens on an exact equality in all branches of trade,\r\nboth wholesale and retail, under the express declaration that no\r\nprivileged rights of chartered boroughs should be allowed to interfere\r\nwith its enforcement.[878] While this statute merely repeated and\r\napplied the general doctrine of the present chapter of Magna Carta, it\r\ndirectly infringed the provisions of chapter 13.[879] Such sweeping\r\nregulations were in advance of their age and could not be carried out\r\nwithout revolutionising the entire medieval scheme of trade and\r\ncommerce, which depended on merchant guilds, town charters and local\r\nmonopolies. The influence of the English boroughs and their political\r\nallies was strong enough to make the strict enforcement of such\r\nlegislation impossible; and later statutes, bowing to the inevitable,\r\nrestored the privileges of the boroughs, while continuing to enunciate\r\nan empty general doctrine of free trade to foreigners.[880] The English\r\nboroughs, to which Parliament in the reign of Richard II. thus restored\r\ntheir franchises and monopolies, were able effectually to exclude\r\nforeign competition, in certain trades at least, from within their\r\nwalls, for four centuries, until the Statute of 1835 ushered in the\r\nmodern era of free trade.[881]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 877:\r\n\r\n  2 Edward III. c. 9.\r\n\r\nFootnote 878:\r\n\r\n  See 9 Edward III. c. 1 and cf. 25 Edward III., stat. 4, c. 7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 879:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, pp. 290-1, where the inconsistency between the two parts\r\n  of the Great Charter is pointed out.\r\n\r\nFootnote 880:\r\n\r\n  See 2 Richard II., stat. 1, c. 1 and 11 Richard II. c. 7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 881:\r\n\r\n  See 5 and 6 William IV. c. 76, s. 14.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER FORTY-TWO.\r\n\r\nLiceat unicuique de cetero exire de regno nostro, et redire, salvo et\r\nsecure, per terram et per aquam, salva fide nostra, nisi tempore gwerre\r\nper aliquod breve tempus, propter communem utilitatem regni, exceptis\r\nimprisonatis et utlagatis secundum legem regni, et gente de terra contra\r\nnos gwerrina, et mercatoribus de quibus fiat sicut predictum est.\r\n\r\n  It shall be lawful in future for any one (excepting always those\r\n  imprisoned or outlawed in accordance with the law of the kingdom, and\r\n  natives of any country at war with us, and merchants, who shall be\r\n  treated as is above provided) to leave our kingdom and to return, safe\r\n  and secure by land and water, except for a short period in time of\r\n  war, on grounds of public policy—reserving always the allegiance due\r\n  to us.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe terms of this permission for free intercourse between England and\r\nforeign lands are peculiarly wide, the exceptions being reasonable and\r\nnecessary. Prisoners obviously could not leave our shores, nor outlaws\r\nreturn to them: the case of merchants from hostile states had already\r\nbeen provided for in a liberal spirit; while the temporary restriction\r\nof intercourse with the enemy on the outbreak of hostilities was\r\neminently reasonable.\r\n\r\nAlthough the provision is thus quite general in its scope, embracing all\r\nclasses and ranks of men, it was peculiarly welcome to the clergy, as\r\nenabling them without a royal permit to proceed to Rome, there to\r\nprosecute their appeals or press their claims for preferment. Thus\r\nconsidered, it contains a virtual repeal of article 4 of the\r\nConstitutions of Clarendon of 1166, which forbade archbishops, bishops,\r\nand parsons (_personæ_) of the kingdom to leave that kingdom without the\r\nking’s licence. The grant of freedom of intercourse in 1215 thus opened\r\na door for the Church to encroach on the royal prerogative; and for that\r\nreason it was omitted from the reissue of 1216, never to be replaced. A\r\nboon was thus withdrawn from all classes from fear that it might be\r\nabused by the ecclesiastics. Henry III. took advantage of the omission\r\nin order to restrain the movements of clergy and laity alike. Those who\r\nleft the country without the royal licence had frequently to pay\r\nfines.[882]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 882:\r\n\r\n  _E.g._ Coke (_Third Institute_, p. 179) cites from _Rot. finium_ of 6\r\n  Henry III. and _Rot. claus._ of 7 Henry III. the following case:\r\n  “_Willielmus Marmion clericus profectus est ad regem Franciae sine\r\n  licentia domini regis, et propterea finem fecit_.” The practice had\r\n  apparently been much the same prior to Magna Carta. _E.g._ Madox (I.\r\n  3) cites from _Pipe Roll_ of 29 Henry II. how “_Randulfus filius\r\n  Walteri reddit compotum de XX marcis, quia exivit de terra Domini\r\n  Regis_.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe stringency with which this prerogative was at first enforced tended,\r\nhowever gradually, to become more lax. The king still preserved the\r\nright, but only exercised it by means of proclamations over particular\r\nclasses or on special occasions, the inference being that all not\r\nactually prohibited were free to come and go as they pleased. Thus in\r\n1352 Edward III. had it proclaimed throughout every county of England\r\nthat no earl, baron, knight, man of religion, archer, or labourer,\r\nshould depart the realm under pain of arrest and imprisonment.[883] The\r\nfact that Edward found it necessary to issue such an ordinance,\r\nautocratic and abhorrent to modern ideals as its terms now appear,\r\npoints to a decrease of royal power, as compared with that exercised by\r\nHenry II., John, or Henry III. A further curtailment of prerogative may\r\nbe inferred from the terms of a Statute of Richard II., which, in\r\nconfirming the king’s power to prohibit free egress from England, does\r\nso, subject to very wide exceptions. Under its provisions the Crown had\r\nthe right to prohibit the embarkation of all manner of people, as well\r\nclerks as others, from every port and other place upon the sea-coast\r\nunder pain of forfeiture of all their goods, \"except only the lords and\r\nother great men of the realm, and true and notable merchants, and the\r\nking’s soldiers,\" who were apparently in 1381 free to leave without the\r\nking’s licence, although earls and barons had been prohibited in\r\n1352.[884] Even if this statute confers on magnates, merchants, and\r\nsoldiers freedom to go abroad without royal licence (which is doubtful)\r\nthe powers of veto reserved to the Crown were still, to modern ideas,\r\nexcessive. It remained in force, however, until 1606, when it was\r\nrepealed under somewhat peculiar circumstances. After the union of the\r\ncrowns, King James, anxious to draw the bond closer, persuaded his first\r\nEnglish parliament to abrogate a number of old laws inimical to Scottish\r\ninterests. It was in this connection that the Act of Richard II. was\r\ndeclared (in words, however, not limited to Scotland) to be “from\r\nhenceforth utterly repealed.”[885] Coke stoutly maintains that this\r\nrepeal left intact the Crown’s ancient prerogative, not founded upon\r\nstatute but on the common law, of which power the already-cited\r\nProclamation of Edward III. had been merely an emanation. He almost\r\nseems, therefore, to argue that the Crown in the seventeenth century\r\nretained authority which extended precisely over those classes mentioned\r\nin the ordinance of 1352.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 883:\r\n\r\n  See Coke, _Ibid._, citing the Close Roll of 25 Edward III.\r\n\r\nFootnote 884:\r\n\r\n  5 Richard II., stat. 1, c. 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 885:\r\n\r\n  4 James I. c. 1, s. 22.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn any view, the prerogative of interfering with the subject’s freedom\r\nto depart from England has never been completely taken from the Crown.\r\nYet, in the course of centuries a great change has been gradually\r\neffected: the _onus_ has been shifted from the individual who wished to\r\nleave the kingdom, on to the king who wished to detain him. While, under\r\nJohn or Henry III., the subject required before embarking to obtain a\r\nlicence from the Crown, under later kings he was free to leave until\r\nactually prohibited by a special royal writ. Coke[886] speaks of the\r\nform originally used for this purpose, a form so ancient in his day as\r\nto be already obsolete, known as _Breve de securitate invenienda quod se\r\nnon divertet ad partes externas sine licentia regis_. This was\r\nsuperseded by the simpler writ _Ne exeat regno_ which is still in\r\nuse.[887] The sphere of this writ was restricted and altered: it ceased\r\nto be an engine of royal tyranny and was never issued except as part of\r\nthe process of a litigation pending in the Court of Chancery. Regarded\r\nalways with suspicion by the courts of common law as a creature of\r\nprerogative, it was for centuries the special instrument which prevented\r\nparties to a suit in equity from withdrawing to foreign lands. Some\r\nuncertainty exists as to the proper province of these writs at the\r\npresent day, since the Judicature Acts have merged the Court of Chancery\r\nin the High Court of Justice.[888]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 886:\r\n\r\n  _Third Institute_, p. 178.\r\n\r\nFootnote 887:\r\n\r\n  Its origin is obscure. See Beames, _Brief view of the writ of Ne\r\n  Exeat_, _passim_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 888:\r\n\r\n  See _Encyclopaedia of Laws of England_, IX. 79.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe use of such writs in this restricted sphere could not be reckoned an\r\noppressive interference with the liberty of the subject. The perfect\r\nfreedom to leave the shores of England and return at pleasure, accorded\r\nby John’s Magna Carta, but immediately withdrawn as impracticable for\r\nthat age, has in the course of centuries been fully realized.[889]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 889:\r\n\r\n  On the whole subject of these writs, see Stephen, _Commentaries_, II.\r\n  439-40 (ed. of 1899), and authorities there cited.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTwo phrases, occurring in this chapter, call for comment, although for\r\ndifferent reasons:—one as embodying an ancient legal doctrine, now\r\nobsolete, the other as anticipating a characteristically modern point of\r\nview. (1) _Salva fide nostra._ This short-lived clause of Magna Carta,\r\nin granting freedom to leave the country, very properly provided that\r\nmere absence from England should absolve no one from allegiance to his\r\nking. The old doctrine of nationality was indeed a very stringent one.\r\nThe rule which prevailed was _Nemo potest exuere patriam_. Everyone born\r\nin the land owed allegiance to its king—and this tie continued unbroken\r\nuntil severed by the death of subject or sovereign; it could be broken\r\nin no other way. According to this maxim, a man born a subject of the\r\nking of England must remain his subject wherever he wandered. A breach\r\nof the duties of allegiance, which were consequent thus on the mere\r\naccident of birth, might expose the offender to the inhuman horrors\r\ninflicted upon traitors.\r\n\r\nA series of statutes, culminating in the Naturalisation Act of 1870,\r\nhave entirely abrogated this ancient doctrine, and substituted one of\r\nperfect liberty. Any native of Great Britain is now free to become the\r\nsubject of any foreign state; and the mere fact of his doing so\r\ndeliberately and with all necessary legal formalities, denudes him of\r\nhis British nationality, severs the tie of allegiance, and frees him\r\nfrom the operation of the law of treason. The words “_salva fide\r\nnostra_” no longer apply.\r\n\r\n(2) _Propter communem utilitatem regni._ The charter, in placing a\r\nrestriction on the right of free egress, during the actual continuance\r\nof hostilities, declared that such restriction was to be imposed for the\r\ncommon good of the kingdom, thereby enunciating what is generally\r\nregarded as a very modern doctrine: John was to take action, not for his\r\nown selfish ends but only _pro bono publico_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER FORTY-THREE.\r\n\r\nSi quis tenuerit de aliqua eskaeta, sicut de honore Wallingfordie,\r\nNotingeham, Bolonie, Lancastrie vel de aliis eskaetis, que sunt in manu\r\nnostra, et sunt baronie, et obierit, heres ejus non det aliud relevium,\r\nnec faciat nobis aliud servicium quam faceret baroni si baronia illa\r\nesset in manu baronis; et nos eodem modo eam tenebimus quo baro eam\r\ntenuit.\r\n\r\n  If one who holds of some escheat (such as the honour of Wallingford,\r\n  of Nottingham, of Boulogne, of Lancaster, or of other escheats which\r\n  are in our hands and are baronies) shall die, his heir shall give no\r\n  other relief, and perform no other service to us than he would have\r\n  done to the baron, if that barony had been in the baron’s hand; and we\r\n  shall hold it in the same manner in which the baron held it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis chapter reaffirms a distinction which had been recognized by Henry\r\nII. but ignored by John. Crown tenants were divided into two classes,\r\naccording as their holdings had been originally granted by the Crown, or\r\nby some mesne lord whose barony had subsequently escheated. The latter\r\nclass received preferential treatment from Henry II. for reasons to be\r\nimmediately explained. The older law of escheats was too vague to prove\r\nan effective restraint on royal prerogative; the king, when a fief had\r\nescheated to the Crown, might reckon grants made by its former owner as\r\nvoid, refusing to acknowledge as binding upon him the titles of the\r\nsub-tenants, treating all sub-tenancies as wiped out by the mere fact\r\nthat their lord’s fief had escheated to the Crown. A mesne lord, on the\r\ncontrary, had no similar rights over the sub-tenants of his tenant who\r\nhad suffered escheat.\r\n\r\nThe king usually mitigated in practice the full severity of this theory,\r\nconfirming as of grace, or from motives of policy, or in return for\r\nmoney, claims which he refused to admit as matter of right. The tenants\r\nof escheated baronies were accepted as tenants _in capite_ of the\r\nCrown.[890] Not only so; but Henry II. did not allow them to be\r\nprejudicially affected by the change. The king would only take from them\r\nthose services and feudal dues which they had been wont to render to the\r\nlord of the barony previous to its escheat. This just and lenient policy\r\nexplains the origin of the division of royal tenants into two classes;\r\ntenants who held of Henry _ut de corona_, and tenants who held of him\r\n_ut de escaeta_, _ut de honore_, or _ut de baronia_ (phrases used\r\nsynonymously).[891] In respect of such obligations as were heavier for\r\nordinary Crown tenants than for tenants of mesne lords, holders of Crown\r\nfiefs _ut de escaeta_ were placed on the more favoured footing. Two\r\nillustrations may be given. While tenants _ut de corona_ under Henry II.\r\nhad to pay large and arbitrary reliefs, those _ut de escaeta_ paid no\r\nmore than 100s. per knight’s fee.[892] Nor was their obligation of\r\n“suit” (or attendance at the feudal court of the lord of the fief) to be\r\nincreased. “The tenants of any honour or manor which had come by escheat\r\nto the Crown, were not suitors of the Curia Regis, but of the court of\r\nthe honour or manor which had so escheated.”[893]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 890:\r\n\r\n  Royal clemency in this respect could not be relied on by the\r\n  sub-tenants of _small_ escheated fiefs (not reckoned as honours or\r\n  baronies). This seems to be the opinion of Madox, _Baronia Anglica_,\r\n  199: “If a fee holden of the Crown _in capite_ escheated to the king\r\n  and was not an Honour or Barony, then such fee did not (that is to\r\n  say, I think it did not) vest in the Crown in the same plight in which\r\n  it was vested in the said tenant _in capite_.” Cf. also _Ibid._, 203.\r\n\r\nFootnote 891:\r\n\r\n  See Madox, _Baronia Anglica_, 169–171; also Pollock and Maitland, I.\r\n  261, and authorities there cited.\r\n\r\nFootnote 892:\r\n\r\n  See _Dialogus_, II. x. F, and _Ibid._, II. xxiv. The same rule applied\r\n  to sub-tenants of baronies in wardship (which was analogous to\r\n  temporary escheat). For example, when the see of Lincoln was vacant,\r\n  and therefore in ward to the Crown in 1168, the heirs of sub-tenants\r\n  paid to Henry only what they would have paid to the bishop; one giving\r\n  £30 for six fees, and another 30 marks for four. See _Pipe Roll_, 14\r\n  Henry II., and cf. _supra_, c. 2. In the matter of scutage, also, a\r\n  distinction was recognized: while tenants _ut de corona_ might be\r\n  compelled to serve in person without an option, crown tenants _ut de\r\n  honore_ (and a _fortiore_ sub-tenants also) might claim exemption on\r\n  tendering scutage. See case of Thomas of Inglethorpe in 12 Edward II.,\r\n  cited by Madox, _Baronia Anglica_, 169–171.\r\n\r\nFootnote 893:\r\n\r\n  _Report on the Dignity of a Peer_, I. 60.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nJohn ignored this distinction, extending to tenants _ut de escaeta_ the\r\nmore stringent rules applicable to tenants _ut de corona_. Magna Carta\r\nreaffirmed the distinction; and, not content with enunciating a general\r\nprinciple, made two particular applications of it: neither reliefs nor\r\nservices of former tenants of baronies were to be augmented by reason of\r\nthe fact that such baronies had escheated to the Crown.[894] Henry\r\nIII.’s Charter of 1217 emphasized a third application of the general\r\nrule, declaring that he would not, by reason of an escheated barony,\r\nclaim escheat or custody over the sub-tenants of that barony.[895] To\r\nunderstand this concession, it must be remembered that under Henry III.,\r\nas under Henry II., sub-tenants of baronies were still liable to have\r\ntheir titles reduced through the reduction by escheat of the title of\r\ntheir lord; while sub-tenants of those who were themselves sub-tenants\r\nwere not exposed to a similar mischance by the escheat of their\r\nimmediate lord. Here also the position of Crown fiefs _ut de escaeta_\r\nwas to be assimilated to that of fiefs of mesne lords, and\r\ndifferentiated from that of Crown fiefs _ut de corona_. Sub-tenancies of\r\nescheated baronies were not to be wiped out, but to subsist, and the\r\nCrown (or its grantee) would take the escheat subject to all liabilities\r\nto, and rights of, sub-tenants.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 894:\r\n\r\n  The need for this special reference to relief is not, at first sight,\r\n  obvious, since c. 2 of Magna Carta, by forbidding John to exact from\r\n  Crown tenants of either class the arbitrary sums taken by his father,\r\n  would seem to have already secured them from abuse. Probably, however,\r\n  c. 43 sought to prevent John from treating each of the former tenants\r\n  of the escheated barony as holder of a new barony of his own, and\r\n  therefore liable to a baron’s relief of £100 instead of the £25 he\r\n  ought to pay for his five fees, or £50 for his ten fees, or as the\r\n  case might be. The case of William Pantol (see _Pipe Roll_, 9 Henry\r\n  III., cited Madox, I. 318) seems to illustrate this. He was debited\r\n  with £100 of relief for his father’s land, but protested that he held\r\n  nothing of the Crown save five knights’ fees of the land which was of\r\n  Robert of Belesme. This plea was upheld, and £75 of the amount debited\r\n  was written off.\r\n\r\nFootnote 895:\r\n\r\n  See c. 38 of 1217, and cf. the gloss given by Bracton (II. folio 87,\r\n  b.) which makes the meaning somewhat less obscure. The Charter of 1217\r\n  contained a saving Clause: “unless the holder of the escheated barony\r\n  held directly of us elsewhere.” Bracton added a second proviso,\r\n  namely, unless the said sub-tenants (now Crown tenants _ut de\r\n  escaeta_) had been enfeoffed by the king himself.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Crown seems not to have strictly observed this rule in practice.\r\nArticle 12 of the Petition of the Barons in 1258[896] complained that\r\nHenry had granted charters conferring rights which were not his to give\r\n(_aliena jura_), but which he had claimed as escheats. An act of the\r\nfirst year of Edward III. narrated how the Crown had confiscated from\r\npurchasers tenements held of the Crown “as of honours,” thus treating\r\nthem “as though they had been holden in chief of the king, as of the\r\nCrown.” Redress was promised by the statute:[897] but irregularities\r\ncontinued throughout the earlier Tudor reigns; and the first Parliament\r\nof Edward VI. passed an act to protect purchasers of lands appertaining\r\nto honours escheated to the Crown.[898]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 896:\r\n\r\n  See _Sel.

Here the wild boar and deer\r\nof various species found shelter, in which they were protected by the\r\nsevere regulations of the “Forest Law.” It was the prevalence of this\r\ncode which absolutely marked off the districts known as royal forests\r\nfrom all that lay _extra forestam_; and this made an accurate definition\r\npossible. A “forest” was a district where this oppressive law prevailed\r\nto the absolute exclusion of the common law which ruled outside. The\r\nforests with their inhabitants had been deliberately omitted from the\r\nunifying process, by which the rest of England had been assimilated\r\nunder a uniform _lex terrae_. They remained in great measure at the\r\ndiscretion of the Crown. This exclusion of the common law from the\r\nconfines of the forests was the root from which many evils grew. In no\r\nother sphere was the prerogative so unfettered as within the charmed\r\ncircles which marked off these royal preserves from more fortunate parts\r\nof the kingdom.\r\n\r\nFrom this definition of a forest as a _legal_, not a _physical_, entity,\r\nit follows that the word is far from synonymous with terms such as\r\n“wood” or “covert,” implying merely natural characteristics. A forest\r\nwas not necessarily covered with trees throughout the whole or even the\r\ngreater part of its extent. Miles of moorland and heath and undulating\r\ndowns might be included, and even fertile valleys, with ploughed fields\r\nand villages nestling among them. The same forest, indeed, might contain\r\nmany woods, some of them on royal demesne and some the property of\r\nprivate owners. In certain places the king’s proprietary rights might be\r\nco-extensive with his forestal rights; but, more frequently, large\r\ntracts of the _solum_ (whether wooded or bare) were owned by\r\nfreeholders, whose rights of property tended to become merely nominal,\r\nwhen overridden by the king’s rights of the chase. Men might live, and\r\ndid live, within the boundaries, but they could enjoy no rights of\r\npersonal freedom or of property inconsistent with the rules laid down by\r\nthe Crown to protect its own interests. Within the imaginary line the\r\nking’s power was supreme, and he used it frankly for the preservation of\r\nbeasts of the chase, not for the good government of the men who happened\r\nto dwell there. These unhappy beings were absolutely subject to the\r\nharsh forest code, a law, in the expressive words of Dr. Stubbs, “cruel\r\nto man and beast.” If accused of forest offences, they had no protection\r\nfrom the common law of England any more than from the law of a foreign\r\nland. It was something, however, that even in these high places of royal\r\nprerogative, customary rules grew up, obtained authoritative\r\nrecognition, and gradually hardened into laws which set some limits,\r\nhowever inadequate, to royal caprice. Before John’s time the forest\r\ncode, as set forth in the Assize of Woodstock, and exemplified by the\r\npractice of forest officials, had taken its place as a definite system\r\nof law distinct from common law and canon law alike.[899]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 899:\r\n\r\n  A convenient short account of the forests, with their special laws,\r\n  special officials, and special courts, will be found in W. S.\r\n  Houldsworth’s _History of English Law_, pp. 340-352. For fuller\r\n  information see _Dialogus de Scaccario_, I. xii.; John Manwood, _Book\r\n  of the Forests_ (1598); Coke, _Fourth Institute_, 289–317; G. J.\r\n  Turner, Preface to _Select Pleas of the Forest_ (1901); and an article\r\n  in the _Edinburgh Review_ for April, 1902.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nII. _Origin of the Forests._ Before the Norman Conquest the kings of\r\nEngland do not seem to have laid claim to any exclusive prerogative in\r\nthis respect. The only ordinance of Cnut on the subject admitted to be\r\nauthentic enacted merely that every man should have his own hunting,\r\nwhile the king should have his.[900] The rights of the Crown, however,\r\nwere strengthened and consolidated by the events of 1066, and by the\r\nhardening of feudal theory which followed. All unoccupied waste lands\r\nbecame royal property; and these were the natural resorts of the larger\r\nsorts of game. The king established a claim to a preferential, and, at\r\nlast, to an exclusive, right to hunt the more important species of\r\nanimals _ferae naturae_, known as \"beasts of the forest\"—embracing the\r\nred deer (harts and hinds), the fallow deer (bucks and does), the roe\r\ndeer of both sexes, and the wild boar, with, exceptionally in one\r\nforest, the ordinary hare.[901] The Conqueror and his sons set great\r\nstore on their hunting, and warned all intruders off the wide tracts of\r\nland claimed as royal preserves. Henry I. formulated the doctrine of the\r\nforest law, and it was probably due to him that “forest” acquired its\r\nhighly technical meaning. With the special meaning came the express\r\nclaim to a monopoly of hunting, together with supreme and exclusive\r\njurisdiction. The disorders of Stephen’s reign lowered the Crown’s\r\nauthority in this respect as in so much else, and Henry II. found the\r\nforests much curtailed. He had no intention to acquiesce in this, but it\r\nwas not till 1184 that he attempted, by the Assize of Woodstock, to\r\nformulate the rules of the forest law. In this sphere, as in so many\r\nothers, the process of organization was completed by Henry II. building\r\non the foundations laid by his grandfather; and the whole structure was\r\nbequeathed in a state of high efficiency to his sons. John’s attitude to\r\nthe forest laws was not entirely consistent. The monk of Barnwall, whose\r\nwork is incorporated by Walter of Coventry in his own, relates to John’s\r\ncredit how, in the year 1212, he attempted, among other reforms meant to\r\npropitiate the people, some relaxations in the severity of the forest\r\ncode.[902] Such clemency was exceptional. More characteristic of his\r\nnormal attitude was the order issued on 28th June, 1209, that hedges\r\nshould be burned and ditches levelled, so that while men starved, the\r\nbeasts might fatten upon the crops and fruits.[903]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 900:\r\n\r\n  _Select Charters_, 156.\r\n\r\nFootnote 901:\r\n\r\n  _Select Pleas of the Forest_, xiii.\r\n\r\nFootnote 902:\r\n\r\n  See W. Coventry, II. 207, and Stubbs’ Preface, lxxxvii. By a writ of\r\n  18 May, 1204 (_New Rymer_, I. 89), he disafforested all Devonshire\r\n  except Dartmouth and Exmoor.\r\n\r\nFootnote 903:\r\n\r\n  R. Wendover, III. 227. This, however, is clearly a biased account of\r\n  the king’s resumption of forest tracts illegally put under cultivation\r\n  by way of purpresture.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIII. _Forest Officials._ The local magistrates who administered the rest\r\nof England were excluded from the confines of the forests by a separate\r\nset of officials. At the head of this special organization was placed,\r\nin early times, the Forest Justiciar (called the chief forester in\r\nchapter 16 of the _Carta de Foresta_), whose duties were divided in the\r\nyear 1238, after which there were two provinces separated by the river\r\nTrent.[904] His appointment was permanent, and his duties, which\r\ncontinued between the eyres, were administrative rather than judicial.\r\nHe had discretionary authority to release trespassers imprisoned for\r\noffences against the forest laws.[905] Under his general supervision\r\neach forest, or group of forests, was governed by a separate _warden_,\r\naided by a number of petty officials known as _foresters_, whose duties\r\nwere analogous to those of a modern gamekeeper, but with magisterial\r\npowers in addition. Wardens were of two classes—\"the one appointed by\r\nletters patent under the great seal, holding office during the king’s\r\npleasure; the other hereditary wardens.\"[906] For the king’s use there\r\nwas situated in or near each forest of any extent a royal residence\r\nwhich, in the Middle Ages, naturally took the form of a stronghold. It\r\nwas convenient that the office of warden should be combined with that of\r\nconstable of this neighbouring castle.[907] “The wardens were the\r\nexecutive officers of the king in his forests. Writs relating to the\r\nadministration of forest business, as well as to the delivery of\r\npresents of venison and wood, were in general addressed to them.”[908]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 904:\r\n\r\n  See _Select Pleas of the Forest_, xiv. The permanent routine work\r\n  performed by this functionary must not be confused with the\r\n  intermittent duties of the Justices of Forest Eyres: although he was\r\n  almost invariably a member of the commission who went on circuit:\r\n  _e.g._ chapter 16 of the Forest Charter speaks of the Chief Forester\r\n  holding pleas of the forest.\r\n\r\nFootnote 905:\r\n\r\n  _Select Pleas_, xv.\r\n\r\nFootnote 906:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Turner, in _Select Pleas_, xvii.\r\n\r\nFootnote 907:\r\n\r\n  Engelard de Cygony, for example, whose name appears in chapter 50,\r\n  occupied this double position. Chapter 16 of _Carta de Foresta_\r\n  forbids _castellans_ to determine pleas of the forests, thus\r\n  strengthening the presumption that wardens were usually constables.\r\n\r\nFootnote 908:\r\n\r\n  _Select Pleas_, xix.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe office was one of authority and of profit, usually paid in kind\r\nrather than by a salary. The warden often held a fief by a tenure\r\nconnected with the service, and enjoyed rights and perquisites always of\r\na valuable nature, though varying with each forest. These were\r\nsufficient to provide him with an income adequate to his position, and\r\nto allow him to find the wages of his under-keepers, who ought thus to\r\nhave been paid officials. Such was the theory; as matter of fact, the\r\nforesters, instead of receiving wages, gladly paid large sums to the\r\nwarden, and recouped themselves, with an ample profit, by extortions\r\nfrom the humble dwellers in their bailiwicks.[909] These unpaid\r\nforesters were expressively said “to live upon the country.” They formed\r\na powerful official class, whose excessive numbers were a source of\r\nconstant complaint. They may be classified in various ways, as, into\r\nriding and walking foresters (of whom there were one and four\r\nrespectively in the normal case), or into foresters nominated by the\r\nwardens, and foresters in fee. These last had vested interests which the\r\nForest Charter was careful to respect; as, where chapter 14 reserved to\r\nthem the right to take “chiminage,” or way-leave, denied to other types\r\nof foresters; they might still enjoy, but not abuse, the “vested rights”\r\nreserved to them.[910]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 909:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, xxi.\r\n\r\nFootnote 910:\r\n\r\n  The same chapter, however, fixed the rates of “chiminage.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWith these professional gamekeepers there co-operated, in later times at\r\nleast, several groups of unpaid magistrates appointed from the knights\r\nand freeholders of the district. Of these honorary officials, whose\r\noriginal function was to supply supplementary machinery for protecting\r\nthe rights of the Crown, but whose position as county gentlemen with a\r\nstake in the district led them also to act to some extent as arbitrators\r\nbetween the king and outside parties, there were three recognized kinds.\r\n(_a_) Towards the close of the twelfth century officers known as\r\n_verderers_ (usually four for each forest) become prominent. They appear\r\nin the _Carta de Foresta_ of 1217, but had not been mentioned in the\r\nAssize of Woodstock of 1184. It is probable that the office was devised\r\nin the interval as a check on the warden’s power, as the office of\r\ncoroner had been instituted in the reign of Richard I. as a drag on the\r\nsheriff. In other important respects the duties of the verderers within\r\nthe forests resembled those of coroners within the rest of the county.\r\nThey were not royal employees, whose whole time was absorbed by the\r\nduties of office and remunerated by fixed salaries or by perquisites,\r\nbut rather local landowners whose magisterial services were unpaid, and\r\nwere presumably required only on special occasions. They were\r\nresponsible directly to the king, and not to the warden; and were\r\nappointed in the county court, their “election” taking place in\r\naccordance with the terms of the writ “_de viredario eligendo_.” They\r\nattended the forest courts and swanimotes, and it appears from chapter\r\n16 of Henry’s forest charter that it was their duty to bring before the\r\nJustices in Eyre lists of all offenders indicted in the lower courts.\r\nThese “rolls of attachment” were certified by their seals.[911] (_b_)\r\nThe _Regarders_ were twelve knights appointed in each forest county to\r\nmake tours of inspection every third year, finding answers to a series\r\nof questions known as the “Chapters of the Regard.” In this way they\r\nreviewed the Crown’s interests alike in “the venison and the vert” (the\r\ntechnical names for game and growing timber respectively), and reported\r\nupon all encroachments: upon hawks and falcons, bows and arrows,\r\ngreyhounds and mastiffs (with special reference to “expeditation” or\r\ncutting of their claws),[912] and generally upon everything owned by\r\nprivate individuals likely to harm the beasts of the forest.[913] (_c_)\r\nThe _Agistors_ are mentioned in the same clause of the Assize of\r\nWoodstock which mentions the Regarders. Four knights were appointed,\r\napparently by the warden of each forest, whose duty it was to protect\r\nthe king’s interests in all matters connected with the pasturing of\r\nswine or cattle within the royal woods. For thirty days at Michaelmas\r\npigs were turned loose with liberty to feed on the acorns and beech mast\r\non payment by their owners of a small fixed sum per head. The four\r\nknights were required to take note of sums thus due, known as “pannage,”\r\nand to collect them at Martinmas.[914]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 911:\r\n\r\n  For the earliest notice of verderers see _Select Pleas of the Forest_,\r\n  xix., n. Their appointment in the county court may indicate that they\r\n  acted in some measure as a check on the professional foresters in the\r\n  interests of the people generally, as well as a check on the warden in\r\n  the interests of the king. Within the forest the warden, with the\r\n  verderers and foresters, offered an exact parallel to the sheriff with\r\n  the coroners and bailiffs (or serjeants) in other parts of a county.\r\n\r\nFootnote 912:\r\n\r\n  See _Carta de Foresta_, c. 6.\r\n\r\nFootnote 913:\r\n\r\n  After 1217, if not before, it was one of their duties to fix the\r\n  number of foresters required, so that the inhabitants need not groan\r\n  under a heavier burden than necessary.\r\n\r\nFootnote 914:\r\n\r\n  In one document they were styled _agistatores precii_ (_Select Pleas_,\r\n  p. 1.), which suggests that fixing the rate was their chief duty.\r\n  “Agist” was a general term; it was apparently correct to speak of\r\n  \"agisting a wood”, of “agisting cattle,” and of “agisting the money\r\n  due.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMention ought, perhaps, to be made of the private foresters also, whom\r\nowners of woods within the forests were obliged to appoint. These “wood\r\nwards,” as they were sometimes called, while paid for by the owner of\r\nthe wood, were expected to protect the king’s interests. In particular,\r\nthey must prevent trees under their care from being destroyed or wasted:\r\nthe king was an interested party in these, since they formed shelter for\r\nhis game.\r\n\r\nIV. _Forest Courts._ The judicial side of the forest system was\r\ndeveloped in a manner equally elaborate. Three sets of tribunals must be\r\ndistinguished: (1) _The Court of Attachments_ (or “view of attachments”)\r\nwas a petty tribunal, the chief duty of which was confined to taking\r\nevidence to be laid in due course before a higher court. Exceptionally,\r\nhowever, it had power to inflict fines for small trespasses against the\r\n\"vert\"—namely, for acts of waste not exceeding the value of fourpence.\r\nIt met once in every forty days,[915] which seems in practice to have\r\nbeen interpreted as once every six weeks, the meetings being always held\r\non the same day of the week.[916] (2) _Courts of Inquisitions._ When a\r\nserious trespass against the forest laws was discovered, a special court\r\nwas, in early days, summoned immediately to make investigations. The\r\nforesters and verderers conducted the inquiry, but it was their right\r\nand their duty to assemble the men of the neighbouring townships to help\r\nthem. In strictness, apparently, all the inhabitants might be compelled\r\nto attend. In practice, it was sufficient if four men and the reeve\r\nrepresented each of the four adjoining villages. Whenever a “beast” was\r\nfound dead in the forest twenty men had thus to assemble, to the neglect\r\nof their own affairs; and they would be made to suffer if they failed to\r\ndiscover the culprit. In one district at least (Somerton) the definition\r\nof beasts of the chase extended to the ordinary hare; and we read[917]\r\nhow four townships sat in solemn judgment, and found “that the said hare\r\ndied of murrain, and that they know of nothing else except\r\nmisadventure,” and how, this verdict not giving satisfaction, the\r\ntownships were fined on the pretext that they were not fully\r\nrepresented. The real offence was their failure to disclose the culprit,\r\nwhich was held to imply a desire to shield him. Some alleviation of the\r\nburden of attendance was effected when, at some date posterior to 1215,\r\n_special inquisitions_ were superseded by one _general inquisition_,\r\nheld at regular intervals (usually every six weeks), to cover all\r\ntrespasses committed during the interval. These courts of inquiry\r\n(whether special or general) only “kept” pleas without “trying”\r\nthem—that is to say, they received and recorded accusations, while the\r\njudgments were reserved for the justices. (3) _The courts of the forest\r\njustices in eyre._ As the smaller courts, in the normal case, received\r\nverdicts and reports, without punishing the offences reported, it is\r\nevident that the whole system ultimately depended on the justices. Their\r\neyres, however, were held at wide intervals—apparently once every seven\r\nyears during the reign of Henry III. A very full attendance of forest\r\nofficials and of the public was summoned to meet them. The evidence\r\nstored up as a result of the work of the smaller courts, supplemented by\r\nthe Rolls of the Regard, was laid before the justices, who summarily\r\njudged “pleas of the vert,” inflicting small amercements, and “pleas of\r\nthe venison,” punishing by imprisonment those previously found guilty,\r\nuntil they ransomed themselves by heavy fines. These eyres came to be\r\nknown as “Courts of Justice Seat,” but not until long after the reign of\r\nJohn. No juries were present, nor were they required; the justices\r\npunished offenders who had already been convicted by juries at a lower\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 915:\r\n\r\n  _Carta de Foresta_, c. 8.\r\n\r\nFootnote 916:\r\n\r\n  _Select Pleas of the Forest_, xxx.\r\n\r\nFootnote 917:\r\n\r\n  _Select Pleas of the Forest_, p. 42.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThese three classes of tribunals exercised functions analogous to those\r\nof a modern court of law. In addition, there should be mentioned two\r\nother kinds of assemblies which performed duties administrative rather\r\nthan judicial, as these terms are now understood. (4) The _regard_, held\r\nonce every three years—not by Crown officials, but by what was\r\npractically a jury of local knights—has already been referred to. These\r\ntours of inspection, sometime known as _visitationes nemorum_,[918] and\r\nsometimes even as “views of expeditation,” were of great practical\r\nimportance. The resulting report was placed before the justices of eyre\r\nas evidence of forest trespasses. (5) Three times every year, meetings,\r\nknown from an early date as “_Swanimotes_,” were held to regulate the\r\npasturing of swine and cattle within the royal woods. A fortnight before\r\nMichaelmas the agistors met the foresters and verderers to provide for\r\nthe agisting of the king’s woods, a process which lasted for thirty\r\ndays—fifteen before and fifteen after Michaelmas. At Martinmas the\r\nagistors collected the pannage in presence of the same officials. A\r\nthird meeting of officials was held in June to make arrangements for\r\nexcluding cattle of all kinds from the king’s woods during the period\r\nwhen the deer were fawning, but at this the presence of the agistors was\r\nnot required.[919]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 918:\r\n\r\n  _Dialogus_, I. xi. E.\r\n\r\nFootnote 919:\r\n\r\n  It is expressly stated in the _Carta de Foresta_ (1217) that only the\r\n  verderers and foresters need be present at the June moot, and the same\r\n  officers, with the agistors, at the two others. The public were\r\n  specially exempted.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe _Carta de Foresta_ applies to these assemblies, and to none other,\r\nthe name \"Swanimotes\"—a word whose correct use has been the subject of\r\nmuch discussion, and whose ambiguity was in later centuries the source\r\nof many errors. Its authoritative appearance in 1217 affords strong\r\nevidence of the original sense which it bore. In later days, however, it\r\nwas more loosely used, being applied to inquisitions, and also to courts\r\nof attachment. This has led to much confusion, while its derivation has\r\nalso been the subject of discussion. Bishop Stubbs derived it from the\r\nword “swain,” on the supposition that courts so-called were normally\r\nresorted to by the general body of swains or country people. As matter\r\nof fact (whatever doctrine may be correct philologically), these\r\nassemblies were connected, not with “swains,” but with “swine.” The\r\npeasantry were specially exempted; whereas all three meetings sought to\r\nregulate the entry or exclusion of pigs from the woods.\r\n\r\nV. _Chases, Parks, and Warrens._ Forests were necessarily royal\r\nmonopolies, and must on this and other grounds be distinguished from\r\nthree things with which they are apt to be confused. (1) A “chase” was a\r\ndistrict which had once been a royal forest, but which had, without any\r\nformal act of disafforestation, been granted by the king to a private\r\nindividual. The result was to transfer the monopoly of hunting therein\r\nfrom the Crown to the grantee, while somewhat modifying the nature of\r\nthe rights transferred. The full force of the forest laws was abated,\r\nalthough the extent and direction of this diminution was nowhere\r\nstrictly defined, varying from chase to chase. Such provisions of the\r\nforest law as continued to be binding were no longer enforced by royal\r\nofficials and royal courts, but by those of the magnate, who thus\r\nobtained a franchise over the chase and the royal beasts it\r\ncontained.[920] (2) A “park” was any piece of ground enclosed with a\r\npaling, or hedge, whether with the object of protecting wild beasts or\r\notherwise, and the right to effect this was quite independent of royal\r\ngrant. If the owner of a manor in the near neighbourhood of a royal\r\nforest wished to keep deer of his own, which he might kill at pleasure,\r\nwhether for sport or for food, without infringing the forest laws, he\r\nhad to stock an enclosure with beasts legally his own, and to keep them\r\nunder conditions which made confusion with the king’s deer\r\nimpossible.[921] In 1234 the barons asserted their right to keep private\r\ngaols for poachers taken in their parks (_in parcis et vivariis suis_),\r\nbut the king refused to allow this.[922] (3) A “warren,” which might\r\nbelong either to the king or to any private owner, carried with it\r\nexclusive rights of hunting within its bounds all wild animals, except\r\nthose technically defined as “beasts of the forest.”[923] In practice it\r\nchiefly embraced hares and foxes.[924] Neither parks nor warrens were\r\nprotected by the forest law, but by that part of the common law which\r\nrelated to theft and trespass. This was, however, vigorously\r\nadministered for the preservation of game, so as to bear with increasing\r\nhardship on the common people, securing a monopoly of hunting to the\r\nland-owning aristocracy, and passing gradually into the modern Game\r\nLaws.[925] Dr. Stubbs held, apparently, too narrow a conception of\r\nwarren when he read it in its modern sense of “a rabbit warren.”[926] It\r\nwas a tract of land wherein exclusive rights of hunting lesser game\r\n(together with rabbits and other vermin) were preserved to its owner.\r\nThe king might, and did, have his warrens and warreners, just as any\r\nsubject might; and these royal warreners, like all Crown officials,\r\ngreat and small, might inflict cruel injustice on the common\r\npeople;[927] but their power of doing harm was less than that of\r\nforesters, as they were dependent on the common law. The forest code did\r\nnot apply even to royal warrens.[928]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 920:\r\n\r\n  _Select Pleas of the Forest_, cix. _et seq._\r\n\r\nFootnote 921:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, cxvii.\r\n\r\nFootnote 922:\r\n\r\n  Statute of Merton, c. 11.\r\n\r\nFootnote 923:\r\n\r\n  _Select Pleas of the Forest_, cxxiii.\r\n\r\nFootnote 924:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, cxxviii-cxxix.

See Round, _Ancient Charters_, No. 18.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nVI. _Forest Rights and Forest Grievances._ It is not difficult to\r\nunderstand the store which the kings of England set upon their forests.\r\nThey prized them not merely as a pleasure ground, but also as a source\r\nof revenue. Fines and amercements, individually small, but amounting to\r\na large sum in the aggregate, flowed into the Exchequer. Great as were\r\nthe pleasure and the profit to the king, the burden and loss inflicted\r\nupon the people, freeholders and peasantry alike, were greater out of\r\nall proportion. Not only were the best interests of the forest-dwellers\r\ndeliberately sacrificed to the royal hunting, not only were the legal\r\nfines swelling the exchequer rendered trebly burdensome by the galling\r\nand wasteful manner of their collection; but the men who paid them were\r\nthe victims of illegal exactions in addition. These grievances may be\r\nconsidered under seven heads:—(1) _The extent of the forests._ The Crown\r\nconstantly strove to extend the boundaries; the people to contract them.\r\nThe Conqueror and Rufus each “afforested” wide tracts of land, of which\r\nthe New Forest is only one example. In the charter of 1100, Henry\r\nbluntly declared:—“I retain in my hand, by the common consent of my\r\nbarons, my forests as my father had them.” This consent of the magnates,\r\nif more than a form and willingly given, would suggest that the barons\r\nwere allowed some share in these royal rights of hunting which led them\r\nhere to make common cause with the Crown. Henry, as a matter of fact,\r\nretained not only the forests of his father but those of Rufus as well,\r\nand created new ones of his own.[929] Stephen, while retaining the\r\nforests of the two Williams, renounced those added by Henry I. Under\r\nHenry II., afforestation began anew.[930] The words of the Great Charter\r\nleave no room to doubt that Henry of Anjou had extended the boundaries\r\nof Stephen’s forests; and that both Richard and John carried the process\r\nfurther, bringing within the circle of the cruel law, not only waste and\r\nmoor, but also many “woods” belonging to private owners. These royal\r\nencroachments were the more oppressive, occurring as they did in an age\r\nwhen population was rapidly increasing and seeking an outlet in the\r\nreclamation of waste places on the debateable land which surrounded the\r\nforests. The vagueness of the frontier aggravated this grievance, as it\r\nwas often difficult for the honest reclaimer of barren land to know\r\nwhether he was committing a trespass for which he might be punished by a\r\ncrushing fine.[931]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 929:\r\n\r\n  This is implied in the terms of Stephen’s Oxford Charter. An example\r\n  of an act of afforestation by Henry is given in _Select Pleas_, 45,\r\n  which shows how “a district could be afforested in a moment by the\r\n  mere word of the monarch; it took centuries to free it from the royal\r\n  dominion.” See _Edinburgh Review_, vol. cxcv. (1902), p. 459. Even the\r\n  Forest Charter (cc. 1 and 3) admitted the Crown’s right to afforest\r\n  woods on its own demesne—reserving, indeed, common of pasture to those\r\n  with legal rights thereto.\r\n\r\nFootnote 930:\r\n\r\n  The policy of Henry I., Stephen, and Henry II. respectively is well\r\n  illustrated by the case of Waltham forest in Essex. See Round,\r\n  _Geoffrey de Mandeville_, 377–8.\r\n\r\nFootnote 931:\r\n\r\n  This group of grievances was partly remedied by chapters 47 and 53 of\r\n  Magna Carta. The former provided for the summary disafforestation of\r\n  all districts made forests by Richard and John, while the latter\r\n  showed a more judicial spirit in the undoing of the similar work\r\n  effected by their father. The _Carta de Foresta_ of 1217 contained\r\n  clauses which took the place of these somewhat crude provisions.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(2) _The monopoly of hunting._ The Crown not only extended the bounds,\r\nbut also made the law more stringent. Such privileges of hunting as the\r\nbarons had were restricted as big game became scarce. The Crown’s\r\ninsistence on a strict monopoly of the more exciting forms of the chase\r\nmay not seem an important grievance, but it was one likely to exasperate\r\nthe sport-loving nobles. John, in 1207, admitted that his barons still\r\nretained some vestiges of their right to share in the hunting of royal\r\nbeasts.[932] These rights were formally recognized and defined in 1217.\r\nChapter 11 of the _Carta de foresta_ allowed each magnate when passing\r\nthrough a forest to take one or two beasts at sight of the foresters,\r\nor, if these officials could not be found, then after blowing a horn to\r\nshow that nothing underhand was being done.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 932:\r\n\r\n  See _Rot. Claus._, I. 85 (dated 11 June, 1207).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(3) _Interference with rights of property._ Freeholders whose lands lay\r\nin districts which the king was successful in afforesting, retained\r\ntheir freeholds, but their proprietary rights lost half their value.\r\nThey could not root out trees, to clear their own lands for cultivation;\r\nfor that was to commit an _assart_. They could not plough up waste land\r\nor pasture (even outside the covert) and turn it into arable, nor build\r\na mill, nor take marl or lime from pits, nor make fishponds, nor enclose\r\nany space with hedge or paling; for these acts of ownership were\r\n_purprestures_. They could not destroy a tree or lop off branches\r\n(except under stringent conditions), without being guilty of\r\n_waste_.[933] They could not agist their woods until a fortnight after\r\nMichaelmas, when the agisting of the king’s demesnes was over (thus\r\nreserving for him the best market and “pannage dues”).[934] Heavy tolls\r\nwere, under the name of “chiminage,” taken from carts and sumpter-horses\r\npassing through the woods. In all these and many other ways, rights of\r\nprivate property in forests were so restricted as to become valueless.\r\nThe Great Charter endeavoured to strike at the abuse of these Crown\r\nrights by providing machinery for the abolition of “evil customs.” The\r\n_Carta de foresta_ entered more into detail. Not only were past\r\ntrespasses of all three kinds,—wastes, purprestures, and assarts to be\r\ncondoned, but the law was altered for the future. The long list of\r\npurprestures was materially curtailed: it was made lawful for a man to\r\nconstruct on his own freehold in the forest, mills, ponds, lime pits,\r\nditches, and arable lands, provided these were not placed within the\r\ncovert (that is in wooded places fit to shelter game) and did not\r\ninfringe on any neighbour’s rights.[935] They might also keep eyries for\r\nbreeding falcons and other birds of prey, and take honey found on their\r\nown ground—rights previously denied to them.[936]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 933:\r\n\r\n  For detailed information as to wastes, purprestures, and assarts with\r\n  their ascending scale of penalties, see _Select Pleas_, lxxxii.\r\n\r\nFootnote 934:\r\n\r\n  See Assize of Woodstock, article 7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 935:\r\n\r\n  See _Carta de foresta_, c. 12.\r\n\r\nFootnote 936:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, c. 13, another clause (c. 14) forbade ordinary foresters to\r\n  exact chiminage, and fixed the rates payable to those with vested\r\n  rights at two pennies for each cart per half-year, and one half-penny\r\n  for each sumpter horse.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(4) _Interference with the pursuits of the poor._ If the rich suffered\r\ninjury in their property, the poor suffered in a more pungent way: stern\r\nlaws prevented them from supplying three of their primary needs, food,\r\nfirewood, and building materials. On no account could they kill deer;\r\nwhile difficulties surrounded the taking of timber from the woods.[937]\r\nIt is true that even the Assize of Woodstock allowed them the privilege\r\nof “estovers,” that is of cutting firewood, but only under stringent\r\nrules. All waste was strictly prohibited; and “waste” was a wide word\r\ncovering, not merely wanton destruction, but all sales or gifts of logs;\r\nwhile nothing could be taken except at sight of the forester, whose\r\nconsent would not be procured for nothing. This may be illustrated from\r\na period sixty years later than John’s reign: Hugh of Stratford, who\r\npaid two and a half marks of yearly rent to the Warden for his post,\r\nrecouped himself by taking “from the township of Denshanger for every\r\nvirgate of land one quarter of wheat in return for their having paling\r\nfor their corn and for collecting dead wood for their fuel in the\r\ndemesne wood of the lord king; and from the same town he took from every\r\nhouse a goose and a hen in every year.”[938] A small sum might be taken\r\nfor every load of sticks; the men of Somerset complained that “from the\r\npoor they take, from every man who carries wood upon his back,\r\nsixpence.”[939] Dwellers within or near the forests were also prohibited\r\nfrom keeping dogs, unless their value for other pursuits, as well as for\r\nhunting, was destroyed by the removal of three claws of the\r\nforefoot.[940] Nor could they keep bows or arrows, so necessary for\r\ntheir protection amid the dangers which beset the inhabitants of lonely\r\ndistricts throughout the Middle Ages.[941] No tanner or bleacher of\r\nhides could reside in the forest districts, unless within the walls of a\r\nborough.[942]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 937:\r\n\r\n  See Assize of Woodstock, article 3.\r\n\r\nFootnote 938:\r\n\r\n  See _Select Pleas_, 123 (6 Edward I.).\r\n\r\nFootnote 939:\r\n\r\n  _Select Pleas_, 127 (1278-9). This was a heavy rate, the more\r\n  remarkable in face of the provisions against “chiminage” in _Carta de\r\n  foresta_, c. 14.\r\n\r\nFootnote 940:\r\n\r\n  Assize of Woodstock, article 14. Cf. _Carta de foresta_, c. 6.\r\n\r\nFootnote 941:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, article 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 942:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, article 15.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(5) _Attendance at forest courts._ Unlike the grievances already\r\nmentioned which pressed chiefly on those within the forests, the burden\r\nof performing “suit” at the forest courts was specially resented by\r\nthose who lived without. At every inquisition representatives from\r\nneighbouring townships must be present, while the entire population were\r\ncompelled to meet the justices on their forest eyres. Henry II.,\r\nwhatever may have been the earlier practice, enforced this duty of\r\nattendance upon those outside the boundaries as well as on those within.\r\nThe Assize of Woodstock admits no exemption for earl or baron, for\r\nknight or freeholder, nor even (according to one version) for archbishop\r\nor bishop. All and sundry must be present at the eyres. The double duty\r\nof doing suit at county courts and at forest courts meant a double loss\r\nof time, and double risk of amercement. This 11th Article of the Assize\r\nwas repealed by chapter 44 of Magna Carta, which restricted the\r\nobligation to denizens of the forests, a concession confirmed in\r\n1217.[943]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 943:\r\n\r\n  See _Carta de foresta_, c. 2.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(6) _Fines and punishments._ Frequent exactions ground down the dwellers\r\nin the royal forests to abject poverty. If they failed to attend one of\r\nthe numerous inquisitions, they paid a fine. If they failed to disclose\r\nthe guilty poacher, they paid a fine. If they gave false information,\r\nthey paid a fine. If they sold or gave away timber, they paid a fine. If\r\nthey kept grey hounds or mastiffs, which had not been “lawed,” that is\r\ndeprived of the requisite number of claws, they paid a fine.[944] If a\r\nbow or arrow were found in their keeping, they paid a fine. If they\r\ncommitted any one of the numerous forms of waste or trespass, they paid\r\na fine. Truly, the wretched peasant must walk warily if he would\r\npreserve sufficient of his miserable pittance to keep himself, his wife\r\nand children, in life and health.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 944:\r\n\r\n  At one time it had evidently been the practice to exact an ox in\r\n  reparation of such transgression, thus leaving the peasant without the\r\n  means of tilling his land. The Forest Charter (c. 6) limited the fine\r\n  to 3s.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Northamptonshire Eyre Roll of 1209 illustrates how a whole township\r\nmight suffer severely for no fault of their own. \"The head of a hart\r\nrecently dead was found in the wood of Henry Dawney at Maidford by the\r\nking’s foresters. And the forester of the aforesaid Henry is dead. And\r\nbecause nothing can be ascertained of that hart, it is ordered that the\r\nwhole of the aforesaid town of Maidford be seized into the king’s hand,\r\non the ground that the said Henry can certify nothing of that\r\nhart.\"[945] There was clearly a strong inducement, in such cases, to\r\nfind someone guilty.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 945:\r\n\r\n  See _Select Forest Pleas_, p. 4.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn certain cases Henry II. would not accept a fine, but inflicted loss\r\nof limbs upon violators of the king’s monopoly. It was often better to\r\nkill a fellow-man than a boar or stag. Article 1 of the Assize of\r\nWoodstock announced that the full rigour of the laws would be enforced,\r\nas under Henry I., while article 12 laid down more definitely that\r\nsureties would only be accepted for two offences. For the third offence\r\nnothing would suffice save the body of the offender. John’s Magna Carta\r\nmade no specific regulation on this head, although the general provision\r\nfor abolishing “evil customs” afforded some relief. Chapter 10 of the\r\n_Carta de foresta_ in 1217 conceded that no one should henceforth lose\r\nlife or limb for such offences. The culprit should lie in prison for\r\nyear and day, and thereafter find sureties for his future good\r\nbehaviour, or failing such sureties be banished from the realm.\r\n\r\n(7) _Arbitrary government and illegal exactions._ If the laws of Henry’s\r\ncode were stringent and the legal payments onerous, it was a worse evil\r\nthat the law, such as it was, could be safely defied by the Crown\r\nofficials, and that payments of a perfectly illegal nature might be\r\nfreely exacted. Within the forest bounds the peasantry lived in daily\r\nfear of the discretionary authority of officials, whose most\r\nunreasonable wishes they dared not oppose. Sometimes a local tyrant\r\nestablished a veritable reign of terror. This happened in the forest of\r\nRiddlington under Peter de Neville, as the records of the Rutland Eyre\r\nheld in 1269 disclose. One item, taken almost at random from the long\r\nlist of his evil deeds, will suffice: “The same Peter imprisoned Peter,\r\nthe son of Constantine of Liddington, for two days and two nights at\r\nAllexton, and bound him with iron chains on suspicion of having taken a\r\ncertain rabbit in Eastwood; and the same Peter the son of Constantine,\r\ngave two pence to the men of the aforesaid Peter of Neville, who had\r\ncharge of him, to permit him to sit upon a certain bench in the gaol of\r\nthe same Peter, which is full of water at the bottom.”[946] In this evil\r\npit, miscalled a gaol, men illegally arrested on mere suspicion were\r\nallowed to rot or starve to death if they failed to pay heavy ransoms.\r\nOther examples are only too abundant. In 1225 Norman Samson, a petty\r\nofficial of the forest of Huntingdon, put men to the torture without\r\ncause, and only released them from their torments in return for heavy\r\nbribes. These petty despots were practically irresponsible, since the\r\neyres were held at wide intervals of seven years. Even then the\r\nsufferers might hesitate to complain, fearing a worse fate when the\r\nbacks of the justices were turned. If such things could happen after the\r\ngrant of the charters of 1215 and 1217, it is not likely that the\r\nforesters were more merciful before. John was always too indifferent or\r\ntoo busy to redress such wrongs. The only guarantee against their\r\nrecurrence in the future was that honest officials should be selected.\r\nMagna Carta sought to secure this by the provisions of chapter 45, which\r\n(occurring amongst the forest clauses) directed that no justiciar,\r\nsheriff, constable or bailiff should be appointed, except such as knew\r\nthe law of the land and meant to observe it. The word constable included\r\nthe wardens, while bailiff was wide enough to embrace the foresters. It\r\nis doubtful whether this clause would have effected any improvement; it\r\nwas withdrawn in 1216.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 946:\r\n\r\n  _Select Pleas_, 50.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSome good must have resulted from chapter 16 of the Forest Charter,\r\nwhich forbade wardens to hold pleas of the forest, and reserved them for\r\nthe justices in eyre. This prevented wardens from being judges in their\r\nown cause; but their arbitrary acts continued to be plentiful under\r\nHenry III., as has been already shown. Blackmail, under thin disguises,\r\nwas levied upon all who would escape the unwelcome attentions of those\r\nin power. Sixty years after Magna Carta the men of Somerset complained\r\nthat “foresters come with horses at harvest time and collect every kind\r\nof corn in sheaves within the bounds of the forest and outside near the\r\nforest, and then they make their ale from that collection, and those who\r\ndo not come there to drink and do not give money at their will are\r\nsorely punished at their pleas for dead wood, although the king has no\r\ndemesne; nor does anyone dare to brew when the foresters brew, nor to\r\nsell ale so long as the foresters have any kind of ale to sell; and this\r\nevery forester does year by year to the great grievance of the\r\ncountry.”[947]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 947:\r\n\r\n  _Select Pleas_, 126.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nEach one of these abuses had been specifically forbidden by chapter 7 of\r\nthe _Carta de foresta_, which had prohibited the making of “scotale” and\r\nthe collection of corn, lambs, and pigs. Such rules were easier to\r\nenunciate than to enforce.\r\n\r\nVII. _Later History of Forests and Forest Laws._ The Forest Charter\r\nsignally failed to secure a pure administration of the law; but two\r\nprocesses were at work which tended to lighten the burdens inflicted.\r\nThe long struggle to define accurately the boundaries ended in the reign\r\nof Edward II. in the defeat of the king, who consented to the frontier\r\nbeing drawn to suit the barons.[948] Within these restricted limits,\r\ntime and the progress of civilization gradually softened the severity of\r\nthe forest code, many customs becoming obsolete.[949] Charles I. made an\r\nill-judged attempt to revive some of the Crown’s long-forgotten rights.\r\nJustice-seats were held by the Earl of Holland, accompanied by\r\namercements and attempts to extend the forest bounds.[950] The result\r\nwas a drastic act of the Long Parliament limiting them to their old\r\nextents.[951] This statute, however, abolished neither the forests, the\r\nforest laws, nor the forest courts. After the Restoration a Justice-seat\r\nactually took place _pro forma_ before the Earl of Oxford. Blackstone\r\ndeclares this to be the last ever held,[952] although the offices of\r\njustice and warden of the forests were not abolished till 1817.[953] The\r\nforests, much curtailed in extent, are still the property of the Crown,\r\nthough now administered in the interests of the public by the\r\nCommissioners of Woods and Forests.[954] The operation of the common law\r\nis, of course, no longer excluded from their confines, the old\r\nantithesis between the forest law and the law of England being now a\r\nthing of the past.[955]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 948:\r\n\r\n  See _infra_, under c. 47.\r\n\r\nFootnote 949:\r\n\r\n  The “_assisa et consuetudines forestae_,” issued by Edward I. in 1278,\r\n  although merely declaratory, may have done something towards\r\n  curtailing the limits of discretionary authority.

The list of\r\nofficers given is a comprehensive one—justices, sheriffs, constables and\r\nbailiffs—embracing all royal ministers and agents, both of the central\r\nand of the local government, from the chief justiciar down to the\r\nhumblest serjeant.[956] The clause was directed in particular against\r\nJohn’s foreign favourites such as the Poitevin Bishop of Winchester,\r\nPeter des Roches,[957] who had wielded and abused the authority of chief\r\njusticiar in 1214 when the king was abroad, or such as Engelard de\r\nCygony and the other tools of John’s extortions, stigmatized by name in\r\na later part of Magna Carta,[958] who had filled various posts as\r\nsheriffs, wardens, and officials of the exchequer. Such men had no\r\ninterests at stake in England, and little love for its customs and free\r\ntraditions. In future John must choose a different type of servants,\r\navoiding all such unscrupulous men, whether Englishmen or foreigners, as\r\nwere ready to break the law in their master’s interests or their own.\r\nThere is thus no difficulty in understanding what class of men were here\r\nexcluded from office; but what class were to fill their places? Bishop\r\nStubbs, commenting on this passage, credits the draftsmen of the Charter\r\nwith an intention to secure the appointment of men well versed in legal\r\nscience: “on this principle the steward of a court-leet must be a\r\nlearned steward.”[959] The clause of Magna Carta, however, refers\r\nexclusively to royal nominees, not to the officers appointed by mesne\r\nlords to preside over their feudal courts. The barons appointed their\r\nown stewards and bailiffs, and had no wish to hamper their own freedom\r\nof choice; but only that of the king. Further, it was not great lawyers\r\nwhom the barons desired John to employ, but plain Englishmen with a\r\nrough-and-ready knowledge of insular usage, who would avoid arbitrary\r\nacts condemned by the law of the land. The barons at Runnymede in 1215\r\ndesired exactly what the council of St. Albans had desired on 4th\r\nAugust, 1213, when it issued formal writs commanding all sheriffs and\r\nforesters to observe the laws of Henry I. and to abstain from unjust\r\nexactions;[960] and it must be remembered that these laws of Henry were\r\nbut the older laws of Edward Confessor slightly amended.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 956:\r\n\r\n  Constable and bailiff are discussed _supra_, c. 24, and shown to\r\n  include forest magistrates, _supra_, c. 44.\r\n\r\nFootnote 957:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, 36–7, and cf.

Hist._, I. 578, n.\r\n\r\nFootnote 960:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, p. 34.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe attitude of John’s barons was the same as that of Henry’s barons,\r\nwhen the latter declared in 1234 in such emphatic terms that they did\r\nnot wish the laws of England to be changed.[961] They were far from\r\ndesiring to be governed by ministers deeply versed in the science and\r\nliterature of jurisprudence, since these would necessarily have been\r\nchurchmen and civilians. The laws which the Crown’s officers must know\r\nand observe were the old customary laws of England, as opposed alike to\r\nthe canon law and the civil law of Rome. Honest Englishmen were wanted,\r\nwith a reputation for straightforward dealing and in sympathy with\r\nnative prejudice. Crown ministers might do well enough without any\r\nacademic training in an age when only one short treatise on the law of\r\nEngland had been written (that of Glanvill); while the stewards of court\r\nleets, referred to by Bishop Stubbs, might even be ignorant of the\r\ncommon law, provided they were versed in “the custom of the manor.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 961:\r\n\r\n  “_Nolunt leges Anglie mutare que usitate sunt et approbate._” See\r\n  Statute of Merton, c. 9.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis provision of Magna Carta, directed primarily against alien\r\nsheriffs, castellans, and other ministers, disappeared in 1216 (without\r\nany comment in the so-called “respiting clause”), along with several\r\nprovisions of a temporary nature, also directed against foreigners. Even\r\nif this well-meaning chapter of John’s Great Charter had remained in\r\nforce, it would not have effected much, in the absence of adequate\r\nmachinery to ensure its enforcement. In promising the selection of such\r\nministers as knew the law and meant to keep it, John remained sole judge\r\nof the men appointed and their intentions. The clause indicated no\r\nstandard of fitness to which appeal could be made, no neutral arbitrator\r\nto decide between the fit and the unfit, and no sanction to enforce\r\ncompliance on an unwilling king. Half a century later, the Provisions of\r\nOxford gave proof of some advance in political theory. They contained an\r\nexpedient, crude enough it is true, for constraining royal officials to\r\nkeep the law. Forms of the oaths of office to be taken by castellans and\r\nministers of all grades were carefully provided.[962] Even this was only\r\na first step towards settling a problem which was not completely solved\r\nuntil, after the struggles of many centuries, the modern doctrine of\r\nministerial responsibility was firmly established.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 962:\r\n\r\n  See _Select Charters_, 388–391, and Madox, II. 149, with authorities\r\n  there cited.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER FORTY-SIX.\r\n\r\nOmnes barones qui fundaverunt abbatias, unde habent cartas regum Anglie,\r\nvel antiquam tenuram, habeant earum custodiam cum vacaverint, sicut\r\nhabere debent.\r\n\r\n  All barons who have founded abbeys, concerning which they hold\r\n  charters from the kings of England, or of which they have\r\n  long-continued possession, shall have the wardship of them, when\r\n  vacant, as they ought to have.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe religious houses of the various orders, (abbeys, priories, and\r\nconvents), which had increased so rapidly in number since the reign of\r\nHenry I., fell naturally into two classes according as they had been\r\nfounded by the king or by private individuals. The king or the great\r\nbaron, in bestowing lands on a religious foundation, reserved, either\r\nexpressly or by implication, certain valuable rights of property, of\r\nwhich the control over the election of the abbot or prior, together with\r\nthe wardship of the fief during vacancies, were the most important. King\r\nJohn, while by his separate charter to the clergy he had renounced in\r\nfavour of all churches and monasteries, cathedral and conventual, all\r\ncontrol over election of prelates, had carefully reserved his rights of\r\nwardship; and the barons insisted that the proprietary rights of mesne\r\nlords who had founded religious houses, should also be respected. John\r\nhowever, wherever he had any plausible pretext, usurped the wardship\r\nover private foundations, in addition to his own. It would appear from\r\nthe terms of a later chapter,[963] that in 1215 the Crown actually held\r\nin ward certain abbeys founded by mesne lords, for provision is there\r\nmade for their restoration. The present chapter looks to the future,\r\nforbidding new usurpations of this nature.\r\n\r\nIn the reissues of the Charter certain verbal changes occur, but it is\r\nnot clear that they imply any changes of substance. In 1216 the words\r\n“and as it has been above declared” were added, implying that the rights\r\nof mesne lords were to be restricted by the rules previously laid down\r\nin chapter 5, as to wardship—rules especially applied to the lands of\r\nbishoprics and religious houses in 1216 by a clause which had no\r\nparallel in John’s charter.[964] In 1217 three other small changes tend\r\nto widen the scope of the clause. The “barons who have founded abbeys”\r\nof John’s grant become “the patrons of abbeys”; royal “charters” become\r\nmore explicitly “charters of advowson”; “ancient tenure” is expanded\r\ninto “ancient tenure or possession.”[965]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 963:\r\n\r\n  See _infra_, c. 53.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIs it possible that the influence of the Church was powerful enough at\r\nRunnymede to prohibit all mention of lay “patrons” and lay presentations\r\nor “advowsons”; whereas it was powerless to prevent the barons pressing\r\ntheir rights of patronage two years later? John’s promise of free\r\ncanonical election[966] had interfered with royal patronage, and Stephen\r\nLangton would be unwilling to admit a subject’s claim to rights which he\r\nhad forced the Crown to renounce. The question of lay patronage, indeed,\r\nwas not directly raised in any version of Magna Carta; but prior to 1215\r\nJohn seems to have interfered between abbeys and their founders. On 16th\r\nAugust, 1200 he granted to William Marshall, Earl of Pembroke, the\r\nprivilege of bestowing the pastoral staff of Nuthlegh Abbey, which lay\r\nwithin that nobleman’s fief; this shows that John forbade appointments\r\nwithout royal licence.[967] The present chapter of Magna Carta made\r\nlittle difference in practice. Henry III. claimed wardship over abbeys\r\nand priories formed by earls and barons on their own fiefs, and kept\r\nthem vacant, by preventing their patrons making appointments without his\r\nlicence.[968]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 964:\r\n\r\n  Compare _supra_, p. 250.\r\n\r\nFootnote 965:\r\n\r\n  This chapter in its final form (1217 and 1225) runs thus: _Omnes\r\n  patroni abbatiarum qui habent cartas regum Anglie de advocatione vel\r\n  antiquam tenuram vel possessionem habeant earum custodiam cum\r\n  vacaverint, sicut habere debent et sicut supra declaratum est_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 966:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, p. 39.\r\n\r\nFootnote 967:\r\n\r\n  See _New Rymer_, I. 81. John had also interfered “in the time of the\r\n  interdict” with what Robert fitz Walter considered his rights of\r\n  patronage over Binham Priory (a cell of St. Alban’s). See J. H. Round,\r\n  _Eng. Hist. Rev._, XIX. 710-1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 968:\r\n\r\n  See Petition of Barons (c. 11), _Sel. Charters_, 384.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN.\r\n\r\nOmnes foreste que afforestate sunt tempore nostro, statim\r\ndeafforestentur; et ita fiat de ripariis que per nos tempore nostro\r\nposite sunt in defenso.\r\n\r\n  All forests that have been made such in our time shall forthwith be\r\n  disafforested; and a similar course shall be followed with regard to\r\n  river-banks that have been placed “in defence” by us in our time.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn analogy may be traced between the royal prerogatives of hunting and\r\nof falconry here brought together. William the Conqueror claimed wide\r\nand ill-defined rights to “afforest” whole districts at his discretion,\r\nand in one well-known instance at least, the creation of the New Forest,\r\nhe made good his claim, at the cost of much suffering to his humbler\r\nsubjects. Large tracts of land were thus consecrated to the wild boar\r\nand the stag. The king claimed somewhat similar powers for protecting\r\nhis preferential rights of fowling. If woods could be “afforested” for\r\nhunting, rivers might be placed “in defence” for hawking. The parallel\r\nmust not be pushed too far. River-banks were preserved only for such\r\nlimited period as was covered by the king’s express command; and\r\nalthough wardens were appointed to guard them,[969] the Crown never\r\nestablished such absolute control over the banks of rivers as it did\r\nwithin districts declared “afforested.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 969:\r\n\r\n  Mention of these officers is made in c. 48. The phrase “in defence” is\r\n  explained _supra_, pp. 357-8.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe provision of the present chapter, defining what river-banks might be\r\n“defended,” disappeared, together with the relative clause of chapter 48\r\n(“_ripariis et earum custodibus_”), from the reissue of 1216; but, in\r\nthe respiting clause there was promised further deliberation, which\r\nresulted in its replacement in chapter 20 of the final version of Magna\r\nCarta.[970]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 970:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, p. 356.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMore attention is usually paid to the bearing of the present chapter\r\nupon the limits of the forests. John, if he had created no new forests,\r\nhad at least extended the boundaries of the old ones. All such\r\nencroachments are to be immediately given up. This summary redress,\r\nwhich implies that John’s aggressions were so notorious as to admit of\r\nno dispute, should be contrasted with the more judicial procedure\r\nappointed by chapter 53 for determining encroachments made by Henry II.\r\nand Richard I. A somewhat similar distinction is also to be found in the\r\ncorresponding provisions of the Forest Charter of 1217 (chapters 1 and\r\n3); but the line is there differently drawn. Chapter 1 of the _Carta de\r\nforesta_ extends the summary methods of redress to the disafforesting of\r\nall forests created by Richard as well as those created by John. The\r\nterms of the later document are also more detailed, making more explicit\r\nthe meaning of the earlier grant. Both seem to be directed against\r\nencroachments on the rights of landowners, affording no protection to\r\nthe poor. While they deny the Crown’s right to afforest private woods\r\n“to the damage of any one” (that is, of barons or freeholders owning\r\nthem), they admit the legality of past acts, whether of Henry, of\r\nRichard, or of John, in afforesting Crown lands, subject always to a\r\nsaving clause in favour of freeholders in right of common of\r\npasturage.[971]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 971:\r\n\r\n  Mr. P. J. Turner, _Select Pleas of Forest_, xciii., points out that\r\n  although forests included open country as well as woods, yet _Carta de\r\n  foresta_ spoke only of “woods” in this connection.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nEven if Henry III. had cordially co-operated with his barons to\r\ndisafforest all tracts of ground afforested by Henry II. and his sons,\r\ndifficulties of definition would still have made the task tedious. As it\r\nwas, struggles to settle the boundaries embittered the relations between\r\nCrown and Parliament, until the very close of Edward Plantagenet’s\r\nreign. Only the leading steps in the slow process by which the\r\nopposition triumphed need here be mentioned.\r\n\r\nAfter the issue of the _Carta de foresta_ on 6th November, 1217,[972]\r\nmachinery was set in motion, in obedience to its terms, to ascertain the\r\nold boundaries and to disafforest all recent additions. The work of\r\nredress continued for some years, suffering no interruption from the\r\nissue of the new royal seal at Michaelmas, 1218.[973] In face of many\r\ndifficulties only slow progress was possible. More strenuous efforts\r\nfollowed the reissue of the Charters on 11th February, 1225;[974] for,\r\nfive days later, justices were appointed to make new perambulations,\r\nwhich resulted in the disafforestation of wide tracts. Henry considered\r\nhimself, and with some reason, as unjustly treated by these justices, or\r\nby the local juries on whose verdicts they had relied. After he had\r\nproclaimed himself of age in January, 1227, he challenged their\r\nfindings; and this has been misinterpreted as an attempt to annul the\r\nForest Charter.[975]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 972:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, p. 171.\r\n\r\nFootnote 973:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, 180, and see _Select Pleas_, xcv.\r\n\r\nFootnote 974:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, p. 181.\r\n\r\nFootnote 975:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _Select Pleas_, xcix.; and see also _supra_, p. 184.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSome of the knights who had perambulated the forests were persuaded or\r\ncoerced into acknowledging that they had made mistakes; and, after\r\nfurther inquiry, Henry restored the wider bounds. His reactionary\r\nmeasures went on for two years; but thereafter the frontiers were fixed,\r\nin spite of many complaints, until strong pressure compelled Edward I.,\r\ntowards the close of his reign, to reopen the whole question.\r\nPerambulations in 1277 and 1279 produced apparently no results. Renewed\r\ncomplaints were followed by new perambulations in 1299-1300, the reports\r\nof which were laid before a Parliament which met at Lincoln on 25th\r\nJanuary, 1301. The king, as the result of hostile forces converging from\r\nseveral sides, had to surrender; and on 14th February he confirmed the\r\nForest Charter, and formally agreed to the reduced boundaries as defined\r\nby the most recent inquests. Edward had acted under constraint: on this\r\nplea he subsequently obtained from Pope Clement V. a bull, dated 29th\r\nDecember, 1305, revoking all the concessions made at Lincoln.[976] The\r\nCrown seemed thus to triumph once more; but the barons refused to accept\r\ndefeat, forcing upon Edward II. the acceptance of the narrower bounds as\r\nthey had been defined at his father’s Parliament in 1301. This\r\nsettlement was confirmed by statute in the first year of the reign of\r\nEdward III.,[977] and that king failed in all attempts to escape from\r\nits provisions. Thus the authoritative pronouncement made in 1301 by the\r\nParliament of Lincoln furnished the basis on which the protracted\r\ncontroversy was finally determined.[978]\r\n\r\nFootnote 976:\r\n\r\n  See _Select Pleas_, cv. Mr. Turner’s account of Edward’s conduct may\r\n  be compared with the estimate of M. Bémont, _Chartes_, xlviii.\r\n\r\nFootnote 977:\r\n\r\n  1 Edward III., stat. 2, c. 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 978:\r\n\r\n  See _Select Pleas_, cvi. There was one exception. On 26th December,\r\n  1327, Edward III. had to submit to further disafforestations in\r\n  Surrey.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe further history of the forest boundaries may be told in a few\r\nsentences. No changes were made until the sixteenth century. When Henry\r\nVIII. afforested the districts surrounding Hampton Court in 1540, he did\r\nso by consent of Parliament, and on condition of compensating all those\r\nwho suffered damage. The same course was followed by Charles I. in\r\ncreating the Forest of Richmond in 1634. Finally, as a result of the\r\nattempts of the Stewarts to revive obsolete forest rights, a statute of\r\nthe Long Parliament, reciting the Act of 1327, “ordained that the old\r\nperambulation of the forest in the time of King Edward the First should\r\nbe thenceforth holden in like form as it was then ridden and\r\nbounded.”[979]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 979:\r\n\r\n  16 Charles I. c. 16.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT.\r\n\r\nOmnes male consuetudines de forestis et warennis, et de forestariis et\r\nwarennariis, vicecomitibus et eorum ministris, ripariis et earum\r\ncustodibus, statim inquirantur in quolibet comitatu per duodecim milites\r\njuratos de eodem comitatu, qui debent eligi per probos homines ejusdem\r\ncomitatus, et infra quadraginta dies post inquisicionem factam, penitus,\r\nita quod numquam revocentur, deleantur per eosdem, ita quod nos hoc\r\nsciamus prius, vel justiciarius noster, si in Anglia non fuerimus.[980]\r\n\r\n  All evil customs connected with forests and warrens, foresters and\r\n  warreners, sheriffs and their officers, river-banks and their wardens,\r\n  shall immediately be inquired into in each county by twelve sworn\r\n  knights of the same county chosen by the honest men of the same\r\n  county, and shall, within forty days of the said inquest, be utterly\r\n  abolished, so as never to be restored, provided always that we\r\n  previously have intimation thereof, or our justiciar, if we should not\r\n  be in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 980:\r\n\r\n  The last sixteen words, inclusive of “_per eosdem_,” appear at the\r\n  foot of both of the Cottonian versions of Magna Carta. Cf. _supra_,\r\n  194–7.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis chapter is mainly, though not exclusively, a forest one. It\r\nprovides in a sweeping and drastic manner for the abolition of “evil\r\ncustoms,” three groups of which are specially emphasized: (_a_) those\r\nconnected with forests and warrens (presumably royal warrens only), with\r\ntheir officials; (_b_) those connected with sheriffs and their\r\nsubordinates; and (_c_) those connected with river-banks and their\r\nguardians. The word “customs” is obviously here used in its wider sense,\r\nembracing all usages and procedure, whether specially connected with\r\npecuniary exactions or not.[981] The word “evil” is not defined, but\r\nhere (in favourable contrast to elsewhere) machinery is provided for\r\narriving at a definition. This takes the form of a new application of\r\nthe useful _inquisitio_. In each county a local jury of twelve knights\r\nwas to be immediately chosen by “the good people” of that county, and\r\nthese twelve received a mandate to hold a comprehensive inquest into\r\n“evil customs” generally. All practices condemned by them (after hearing\r\non oath smaller local juries, doubtless) were to be abolished within\r\nforty days of the inquiry, “so that they shall never be restored.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 981:\r\n\r\n  Contrast the more restricted meaning of the same word in c. 41.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAt the end of the chapter appears a proviso that, before actual\r\nabolition, notice must be sent to the king, or, in his absence, to his\r\njusticiar. Although such intimation was absolutely necessary, both on\r\ngrounds of policy and of ordinary courtesy, it would appear that this\r\nclause was inserted only at the instance of the king’s friends; at\r\nleast, it is written (as an afterthought) at the foot of two of the\r\ncopies of the Great Charter.\r\n\r\nWhether acting under pressure or from grounds of policy, John lost no\r\ntime in instituting the machinery necessary for effecting this part of\r\nthe reforms. On the very day on which the terms of peace were finally\r\nconcluded between king and barons at Runnymede, namely, on 19th June,\r\n1215, he began the issue of writs to sheriffs, warreners, and river\r\nbailiffs. Within a few days every one of these had been certified of the\r\nsettlement arrived at, and had received commands to have twelve knights\r\nchosen by the county in the first county court, who should make sworn\r\ninquest into evil customs.[982]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 982:\r\n\r\n  See _Rot. Pat._, I. 180, cited also _Select Charters_, 306–7. Cf.\r\n  _supra_, p. 47.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThese orders were obeyed: knights were appointed in the various\r\ncounties, who seem to have taken a liberal view of their own functions.\r\nFar from confining themselves to declaring customs to be evil, or even\r\nto seeing them abolished, they claimed to share with the sheriffs the\r\nexercise of the entire executive authority of the county. Some warrant\r\nfor these pretensions may be found in the terms of a second series of\r\nwrits issued in the king’s name on 27th June and following days. These\r\nwere addressed to the sheriff and the twelve knights jointly, commanding\r\nthem to make instant seizure of all who refused to take, as required in\r\nthe previous writs, the oath of obedience to the twenty-five executors\r\nof the Charter.[983] The revolutionary committee of the central\r\ngovernment had thus in each county local agents in the twelve knights\r\nwhose original duties had been to see evil customs abolished.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 983:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _infra_, c. 61.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe hatred which all classes bore to the forest laws is well illustrated\r\nby the iconoclastic spirit in which these knights concurred with the\r\njurors of each small district, and with all others concerned, for the\r\ndrastic treatment of abuses. Moderate-minded men began to fear that\r\nthese sweeping changes would virtually abolish the royal forests\r\naltogether (in their technical legal sense). Accordingly, the leading\r\nprelates, who were in large measure responsible for inducing the king to\r\nmake truce at Runnymede, and were thus under a moral obligation to do\r\nwhat they could to prevent the barons breaking faith, issued a written\r\nprotest. They declared that the chapter in question must be understood\r\nby both parties “as limited,” and “that all those customs shall remain,\r\nwithout which the forests cannot be preserved.”[984] Clearly, the whole\r\ncode of the forest laws was in danger of being swept out of existence,\r\nas forming one huge “evil custom.” What effect, if any, this protest\r\nhad, is not known. The country was soon plunged in civil war, during the\r\ncontinuance of which neither side had leisure for the reform of abuses,\r\nhowever urgently required. In 1216 the subject was one of those\r\n“respited” for future consideration, and in 1217 an attempt was made to\r\nspecify in detail those evil customs which were to be abolished. The\r\ndangerous experiment of leaving such definition to local juries in each\r\ndistrict was not repeated.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 984:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, p. 52. The text is given _Rot. Claus._, 17 John, m. 27,\r\n  d. and _New Rymer_, I. 134. It runs in name of the archbishops of\r\n  Canterbury and Dublin, and of the bishops of London, Winchester, Bath,\r\n  Lincoln, Worcester, and Coventry, forming (with one exception, the\r\n  bishop of Rochester) precisely those mentioned in the preamble to\r\n  Magna Carta.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER FORTY-NINE.\r\n\r\nOmnes obsides et cartas statim reddemus que liberate fuerunt nobis ab\r\nAnglicis in securitatem pacis vel fidelis servicii.\r\n\r\n  We will immediately restore all hostages and charters delivered to us\r\n  by Englishmen, as sureties of the peace or of faithful service.\r\n\r\n\r\nA feature of John’s system of government was the constant demand for\r\nhostages as guarantees of his subjects’ loyalty. Such an expedient was,\r\nindeed, naturally resorted to in the Middle Ages upon special occasions,\r\nas, for example, to secure the observance of a recent treaty, or where\r\nthe leaders of a rebellion, newly suppressed, had been spared on\r\ncondition of future good behaviour. Thus the Conqueror, in 1067, during\r\na forced absence from England immediately after its acquisition, took\r\nwith him Edgar Atheling and the Earls Morkere and Eadwin; and many other\r\ninstances readily occur. Such cases were, however, exceptional, until\r\nJohn established an unfortunate claim to distinction as the only king of\r\nEngland who ever resorted to such a policy, not merely in face of\r\ndanger, but as a constant and normal practice in times of peace. It may\r\nbe that his continual suspicions were well grounded; but this scarcely\r\nexcuses them, since it was his own bad government which goaded his\r\nsubjects into a condition of perpetual unrest.\r\n\r\nJohn lived in his native England like a foreign conqueror in the midst\r\nof a hostile race, keeping sons and daughters in his clutches to answer\r\nfor their parents’ attempts at revolt. This ingenious but unfair\r\npractice accords well with what we know of John’s character and general\r\npolicy. It was a measure of almost devilish cunning for obtaining his\r\nimmediate aim, but likely to recoil on himself whenever a critical state\r\nof his fortunes arrived. Its efficacy lay in this, that it forced the\r\nhand of discontented magnates, compelling them to decide upon the\r\ninstant between the desperate expedient of open rebellion and the\r\ndelivery of their children to an unscrupulous enemy, thus renouncing,\r\nperhaps for ever, the possibility of resistance or revenge, thereafter\r\nto be purchased at too dear a price—the life of the hostage. By thus\r\nparalyzing his enemies one by one, John hoped to render disaffection\r\ninnocuous. Those nobles whom the tyrant did not thus control through\r\ntheir tenderest affections were too few for effective resistance. At the\r\nslightest show of temper, they, too, were suddenly pounced upon for\r\nhostages, thus joining the ranks of those who dared not rebel.[985]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 985:\r\n\r\n  The only magnates not exposed to this dilemma were the prelates, whose\r\n  celibacy cut them adrift from family ties. They had no hostages to\r\n  give, and were, further, in the normal case, exempt from fear of\r\n  personal violence.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe entire history of the reign shows of what excessive practical\r\nimportance this question of hostages had become. It abounds with\r\nexamples of the varied pretexts upon which John demanded them, and of\r\nhis drastic methods of visiting upon their heads the sins of those who\r\nhad pledged them. Thus, in 1201, John seized the castles of certain of\r\nhis barons; and one of them, William of Albini, only saved his\r\nstronghold of Belvoir by handing over his son as a hostage.[986] In the\r\nsame year, the men of York offended the king by omitting to meet him in\r\nprocession when he visited their city, and by their failure to provide\r\nquarters for the billeting of his archers. The king, as usual, demanded\r\nhostages, but ultimately allowed the citizens to escape on payment of\r\n£100 to buy back the king’s goodwill.[987]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 986:\r\n\r\n  See R. Hoveden, IV. 161.\r\n\r\nFootnote 987:\r\n\r\n  See _Rotuli de Finibus_, p. 119.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHardly a year passed without similar instances; but, apparently, it was\r\nnot until 1208 that the practice was enforced wholesale. In that year\r\nthe king’s abject fear of the effects of the Pope’s absolution of his\r\nbarons from their allegiance led to his demand that every leading man in\r\nEngland should hand over his sons, nephews, or other blood relations to\r\nthe king’s messengers.[988]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 988:\r\n\r\n  See R. Wendover, III. 224-5, and M. Paris, II. 523.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe danger of failure to comply with such demands is illustrated by the\r\nfate of Maud of Saint-Valery, wife of William de Braose, who refused\r\npoint-blank to hand over her grandchildren to a king who, she was unwise\r\nenough to say, “had murdered his captive nephew.”[989] Two years later\r\nJohn, after failing to extort enormous sums in name of fines, caused\r\nher, with her eldest son, to be starved to death, a fate to which her\r\nown imprudence had doubtless contributed.[990] John’s drastic methods of\r\ntreating his hostages may also be illustrated from the chronicles of his\r\nreign, for example, from the fate of the youths he brought from Wales in\r\nJune, 1211. When he heard of the Welsh rebellion of the following year,\r\nhe ordered his levies to meet him at Nottingham. On his arrival, at the\r\nmuster, early in September, John found awaiting him a great concourse,\r\nwho were treated to an object lesson which long might haunt their\r\ndreams. His passion at white heat, John incontinently hanged\r\neight-and-twenty defenceless boys of the noblest blood of Wales.[991]\r\nThis ghastly spectacle could not have been forgotten by any one then\r\npresent, when later in the same month the king, in the throes of sudden\r\npanic, fled to London; and, secure in the fastnesses of the tower,\r\ndemanded hostages wholesale from all the nobles whose fidelity he\r\ndoubted. The inveterate Eustace de Vesci and Robert fitz Walter\r\npreferred to seek safety in flight, the only alternative open to\r\nthem.[992] The others, with the Nottingham horror fresh in their\r\nmemories, were constrained to hand over, with feelings that may be\r\nconceived, their sons and daughters to the tender mercies of John,\r\ncunning and cruel by nature, and rendered doubly treacherous by\r\nsuspicion intensified by fear.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 989:\r\n\r\n  R. Wendover and Matthew Paris, _Ibid._\r\n\r\nFootnote 990:\r\n\r\n  See authorities cited by Miss Norgate, _John Lackland_, p. 288.\r\n\r\nFootnote 991:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, p. 30.\r\n\r\nFootnote 992:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, p. 30.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe defects of this policy, in the long run, may be read in the events\r\nwhich preceded Magna Carta. When John’s hold on the hostages was\r\nrelaxed, because of his preparations for the campaign of 1214, ending as\r\nit did in utter discomfiture, the disaffected were afforded their\r\nlong-desired opportunity, and were stimulated to rapid action by the\r\nthought that such a chance might never occur again. John, on his return,\r\nheld comparatively few hostages, and the northern barons saw that they\r\nmust act, if at all, before their children were once more in the\r\ntyrant’s clutches.\r\n\r\nEven in June, 1215, John had control over a few hostages, and the\r\nchapter now under discussion demands the immediate restoration of those\r\nof English birth (the Welsh receiving separate treatment) together with\r\nthe charters which John held as additional security, very much as a\r\ncreditor might hold the titles of a mortgaged property. This provision\r\nof Magna Carta was immediately carried out. Letters were dispatched to\r\nthe custodians of royal hostages, ordering an immediate release.[993]\r\nThe practice of taking hostages, however, by no means ended with the\r\ngranting of the Great Charter. Before a year had run, some of the\r\ninsurgent nobles, repenting of their boldness, succeeded in making terms\r\nwith John by the payment of large sums of money and the delivery of\r\ntheir sons and daughters in security for their future loyalty. Simon\r\nfitz Walter, for example, thus gave up his daughter Matilda.[994]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 993:\r\n\r\n  See for example a letter of 23rd June to Stephen Harengod, referred to\r\n  _supra_, p. 49.\r\n\r\nFootnote 994:\r\n\r\n  See _Rotuli de Finibus_, 571. The custody of hostages might,\r\n  apparently, be a desirable office, since in 1199, Alan, the earl’s\r\n  son, offered three greyhounds for the custody of a certain hostage of\r\n  Brittany; so it appears from _Rotuli de Finibus_, p. 29.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER FIFTY.\r\n\r\nNos amovebimus penitus de balliis parentes Gerardi de Athyes, quod de\r\ncetero nullam habeant balliam in Anglia; Engelardum de Cygony, Petrum et\r\nGionem et Andream, de Cancellis, Gionem de Cygony, Galfridum de Martinny\r\net fratres ejus, Philippum Marci et fratres ejus, et Galfridum nepotem\r\nejus, et totam sequelam eorundem.\r\n\r\n  We will entirely remove from their bailiwicks, the relations of Gerard\r\n  de Athyes (so that in future they shall have no bailiwick in England),\r\n  namely Engelard de Cygony, Peter, Gyon, and Andrew of the Chancery,\r\n  Gyon de Cygony, Geoffrey de Martyn with his brothers, Philip Mark with\r\n  his brothers and his nephew Geoffrey, and the whole brood of the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 45 sought to secure the appointment of suitable men to posts of\r\ntrust under the Crown; the present chapter definitely excludes from\r\nbailiwicks (a comprehensive term embracing all grades of local\r\nmagistracies) one particular group of royal favourites. Their names\r\nprove them of foreign extraction. They had come from Brabant, Flanders,\r\nand Poitou,[995] and several of them stayed on in England and held\r\nlucrative posts under Henry III. in spite of the ban here laid upon\r\nthem. The clause of John’s Charter which excluded them from office was\r\nindeed omitted from future reissues, along with chapter 45.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 995:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Bémont, _Chartes_, 22, n, and 116.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe reasons which had rendered them obnoxious to the barons are not\r\nexplained, but may be readily imagined. They had filled the unpopular\r\nposts of collectors of customs, wardens of forests, and commanders of\r\nroyal garrisons, and had distinguished themselves by their unscrupulous\r\nzeal in pushing the king’s prerogatives connected with trade, castles,\r\nforests, and purveyance.\r\n\r\nThe career of Engelard de Cygony may be taken as typical of the rest. He\r\nwas a nephew of Gerard de Athyes,[996] and was deep in the confidence of\r\nhis master, as is proved by the number of responsible offices with which\r\nhe was entrusted. We know that in 1211 he acted as Sheriff of\r\nGloucester, since he accounted to the Exchequer for the _firma\r\ncomitatus_. He further accounted for the _firma burgi_ of Bristol,[997]\r\nwhich seems to imply interference with the chartered liberties of that\r\ncity. It was probably because John required his services elsewhere, that\r\nsome of his sheriff’s duties were performed by deputy, a burgess named\r\nRichard rendering accounts on his behalf. Engelard also held pleas of\r\nthe Crown for Gloucestershire, in violation alike of the ordinance of\r\n1194 forbidding any sheriff to act as justiciar in his own county, and\r\nof the customary rule (confirmed only, not originated, by chapter 24 of\r\nMagna Carta) which prevented sheriffs from holding pleas of the\r\nCrown.[998] Several entries tell of barrels of wine which he took as\r\n“prise” from ships entering the port of Bristol. For example, the\r\nexchequer officials allowed him to deduct from the amount which he owed\r\nas _firma_, the sum of 60s., in respect of four tuns of red wine, as\r\ncertified by the king’s writ,[999] an entry which suggests that he had\r\npurchased from the Crown the profits yielded by the prerogative of\r\ntaking prise; and had then resold to the king the hogsheads actually\r\nrequired for the royal use at 15s. each. Engelard also guarded a rich\r\ntreasure for the king at Bristol, probably as constable of the castle\r\nthere, sums being paid to him _ad ponendum in thesauro regis_.[1000] On\r\none occasion he was entrusted with the custody of more than 10,000 marks\r\nof the king’s money.[1001] Hostages, as well as bullion, were placed\r\nunder his care; a writ dated 18th December, 1214, directed him to\r\nliberate three noble Welshmen whom it mentioned by name.[1002]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 996:\r\n\r\n  See R.

He\r\nsuccessfully defended Windsor from the French faction, making vigorous\r\nsorties until relieved by the king.[1003] He requisitioned supplies to\r\nmeet the royal needs; and a plea was brought against him so long\r\nafterwards as 1232, in connection with twelve hogsheads of wine thus\r\ntaken.[1004] He acted as sheriff of Surrey under William Marshal, the\r\nRegent, but was suspended from this office in 1218 in consequence of a\r\ndispute with Earl Warenne.[1005] He remained warden of the castle and\r\nforests for twenty years after the accession of Henry III.,[1006] and\r\nhis long services were rewarded with grants of land: in the county of\r\nOxford he held the manor of Benzinton, with four hundreds and a half,\r\nduring the king’s good pleasure;[1007] while his son Oliver received the\r\nlucrative post of guardian over the lands and heirs of Henry de\r\nBerkley.[1008]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1003:\r\n\r\n  See M. Paris, II. 665, who calls him “_Ingelardus de Athie_” and\r\n  describes him as _vir in opere martis probatissimus_. Cf. _Rot.

Pat._, 9 Henry III. m. 6.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn 1221, however, acting in consort with Falkes de Bréauté, Philip Mark,\r\nand other castellans, Engelard supported earl William of Aumâle in his\r\nresistance to the demands of Henry’s ministers, that all royal castles\r\nshould be restored to the king. Notwithstanding the secrecy with which\r\nhe sent men to the earl at Biham castle,[1009] he fell under suspicion\r\nof treason, and escaped imprisonment only on finding hostages that he\r\nwould hold the castle of Windsor for the king, and surrender it at his\r\nwill.[1010] In 1236, he was relieved of some of his offices, but not of\r\nall, for in 1254 he was two years in arrears with the _firma_ of the\r\nmanor of Odiham.[1011] In that year, apparently, he died; for the patent\r\nroll contains a writ granting him permission to make his will, and an\r\nentry in 1255 relates how “for good service done to the king by Engelard\r\nde Cygony in his lifetime, the king granted to his executors that they\r\nshould be quit of all accounts to be rendered by them at the exchequer,\r\nand of all averages of accounts, and of all debts and imposts.”[1012]\r\nEngelard thus died, as he had lived, the trusted servant and favourite\r\nof kings. His career illustrates how the very same men who had incurred\r\nodium as the partizans of John became, when the civil war was over, the\r\ninstruments of his son’s misgovernment.[1013]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1009:\r\n\r\n  R.

Claus._, I.\r\n  412), while Guy de Chancel in 1214 accounted for the scutage of the\r\n  honour of Gloucester (Madox, I. 639), and for the rent of the barony\r\n  of William of Beauchamp (_Ibid._, I. 717).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE.\r\n\r\nEt statim post pacis reformacionem amovebimus de regno omnes alienigenas\r\nmilites, balistarios, servientes, stipendiarios, qui venerint cum equis\r\net armis ad nocumentum regni.\r\n\r\n  As soon as peace is restored, we will banish from the kingdom all\r\n  foreign-born knights, cross-bowmen, serjeants, and mercenary soldiers,\r\n  who have come with horses and arms to the kingdom’s hurt.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn here binds himself to disband his foreign troops, who had acted as\r\nthe agents of his tyrannies, keeping the native English in subjection,\r\nand ever ready to take the field in the event of rebellion. These men,\r\nwho had garrisoned the royal castles which formed such formidable\r\nengines of oppression in the Middle Ages, are now to be banished “as\r\nsoon as peace is restored,” an indication that, even at the date of\r\nMagna Carta, a state of virtual war was recognized. This promise was\r\npartially fulfilled. On 23rd June writs were issued for the disbandment\r\nof the mercenaries.[1014] The renewal of the civil war, however, was\r\nfollowed by the enrolment of new bands of foreigners on both sides, and\r\nthese men long continued to exercise an evil influence in England. Their\r\npresence was one of the main causes of the rebellion of 1224, after the\r\nsuppression of which most of them were again banished with their\r\nring-leader, Falkes de Bréauté, at their head.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1014:\r\n\r\n  See _Rot. Pat._, 17 John, m. 23 (_New Rymer_, I. 134).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe words used to describe these soldiers are comprehensive.\r\n_Stipendiarii_ embraced mercenaries of every kind: _balistarii_ were\r\ncross-bowmen. This weapon, imported into England as a result of the\r\ncrusades, quickly superseded the earlier short bow, but had, in turn, to\r\nsuccumb to the long bow, which was apparently derived from Wales, and\r\nwas developed as the regular weapon of one branch of the English army by\r\nEdward I., who gained by means of it many battles against the Scotch and\r\nWelsh, and made possible the later triumphs of the Black Prince and of\r\nHenry V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO.\r\n\r\nSi quis fuerit disseisitus vel elongatus per nos sine legali judicio\r\nparium suorum, de terris, castellis, libertatibus, vel jure suo, statim\r\nea ei restituemus; et si contencio super hoc orta fuerit, tunc inde fiat\r\nper judicium viginti quinque baronum, de quibus fit mencio inferius in\r\nsecuritate pacis: de omnibus autem illis de quibus aliquis disseisitus\r\nfuerit vel elongatus sine legali judicio parium suorum, per Henricum\r\nregem patrem nostrum vel per Ricardum regem fratrem nostrum, que in manu\r\nnostra habemus, vel que alii tenent que nos oporteat warantizare,\r\nrespectum habebimus usque ad communem terminum crucesignatorum; exceptis\r\nillis de quibus placitum motum fuit vel inquisicio facta per preceptum\r\nnostrum, ante suscepcionem crucis nostre: cum autem redierimus de\r\nperegrinacione nostra, vel si forte remanserimus a peregrinacione\r\nnostra, statim inde plenam justiciam exhibebimus.\r\n\r\n  If any one has been dispossessed or removed[1015] by us, without the\r\n  legal judgment of his peers, from his lands, castles, franchises, or\r\n  from his right, we will immediately restore them to him; and if a\r\n  dispute arise over this, then let it be decided by the five-and-twenty\r\n  barons of whom mention is made below in the clause for securing the\r\n  peace.[1016] Moreover, for all those possessions, from which any one\r\n  has, without the lawful judgment of his peers, been disseised or\r\n  removed, by our father, King Henry, or by our brother, King Richard,\r\n  and which we retain in our hand (or which are possessed by others, to\r\n  whom we are bound to warrant them) we shall have respite until the\r\n  usual term of crusaders; excepting those things about which a plea has\r\n  been raised, or an inquest made by our order, before our taking of the\r\n  cross; but as soon as we return from our expedition (or if perchance\r\n  we desist from the expedition) we will immediately grant full justice\r\n  therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1015:\r\n\r\n  The _elongatus_ of the Charter replaces the _prolongatus_ of the\r\n  Articles of the Barons.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1016:\r\n\r\n  That is, in the so-called “executive clause” the “_forma securitatis\r\n  ad observandum pacem_” of the Articles, which became chapter 61 of the\r\n  Charter (_q.v._).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Charter here reverts to a topic of vital interest to the barons, the\r\nsubject of illegal disseisins already raised in chapter 39, which is\r\nhere supplemented. Legal remedy is provided for everyone dispossessed by\r\nthe Crown “_sine legali judicio parium suorum_.” A distinction is drawn,\r\nhowever, between two classes of wrongs, according as they have been\r\ninflicted by John himself, where summary methods are to rule, or by his\r\npredecessors, where less precipitate procedure must take its course.\r\n\r\nThe Articles of the Barons had recognized the same distinction, while\r\nproviding somewhat different treatment. Those disseised by Henry or\r\nRichard were to get redress \"according to the judgment of their peers in\r\nthe king’s court\"; those disseised by John, “according to the judgment\r\nof the twenty-five barons,” that is, of the executors, to be afterwards\r\nmore fully discussed. Both cases, however, were in the Articles\r\nqualified by a stipulation which calls for comment. John had taken the\r\ncrusader’s vow a few months previous, and now claimed the usual three\r\nyears’ “respite” allowed to those preparing for the holy war, from all\r\nlegal proceedings against them. The barons, viewing John’s vow as a\r\ndeliberate and notorious perjury, rejected his claim. The point was\r\nreferred by the Articles of the Barons to arbitration. The prelates,\r\nwhose _judicium_ on this point was declared to be final (“_appellatione\r\nremota_”), and who were bound to give an early decision (“_ad certum\r\ndiem_”), might not unreasonably have been suspected of partiality, since\r\n“taking the cross” was not a step to be belittled by churchmen. Yet they\r\nseem to have acted in a spirit of not unfair compromise, if the clause\r\nas it finally appeared in John’s Magna Carta may be taken as giving the\r\nsubstance of their award.\r\n\r\nThe crusader’s privilege was not allowed by Langton and his\r\nfellow-arbitrators in cases where John himself had been the disseisor;\r\nthe twenty-five executors might there decide forthwith. Respite was\r\nallowed, however, in respect of the disseisins of Henry and of Richard\r\n(except where legal proceedings were already pending).[1017] The Charter\r\nsays nothing of the procedure to be adopted at the close of the three\r\nyears; but there was probably no intention to depart from the terms of\r\nthe Articles in this respect, namely, \"judgment of peers in the king’s\r\ncourt.\"\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1017:\r\n\r\n  This “benefit of a crusader” was extended to John in three other sets\r\n  of complaints, specified in c. 53 (_q.v._).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nJohn had good reason to consider as unfair the mode here appointed for\r\ndeciding disputes as to disseisins effected by him. Many delicate points\r\nwould thus be referred to the summary decision of a baronial committee,\r\nsure to be composed of his most bitter enemies—the very men, perhaps,\r\nwhom he had dispossessed. If the “judgment of the twenty-five” meant for\r\nthe barons “the judgment of peers,” it meant for the king the judgment\r\nof inferiors and enemies.[1018]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1018:\r\n\r\n  This chapter embraced not merely estates still retained in John’s\r\n  possession, but also those granted out anew, the titles of which had\r\n  been guaranteed by the Crown. If the former owner recovered these, the\r\n  Crown was legally bound by feudal law to make good the loss inflicted\r\n  on the present holder by his eviction. The case of Welshmen is\r\n  specially treated in c. 56 (_q.v._).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE.\r\n\r\nEundem autem respectum habebimus, et eodem modo, de justicia exhibenda\r\nde forestis deafforestandis vel remansuris forestis, quas Henricus pater\r\nnoster vel Ricardus frater noster afforestaverunt, et de custodiis\r\nterrarum que sunt de alieno feodo, cujusmodi custodias hucusque habuimus\r\noccasione feodi quod aliquis de nobis tenuit per servicium militare, et\r\nde abbaciis que fundate fuerint in feodo alterius quam nostro, in quibus\r\ndominus feodi dixerit se jus habere; et cum redierimus, vel si\r\nremanserimus a peregrinacione nostra, super hiis conquerentibus plenam\r\njusticiam statim exhibebimus.[1019]\r\n\r\n  We shall have, moreover, the same respite and in the same manner in\r\n  rendering justice concerning the disafforestation or retention of\r\n  those forests which Henry our father and Richard our brother\r\n  afforested, and concerning the wardship of lands which are of the fief\r\n  of another (namely, such wardships as we have hitherto had by reason\r\n  of a fief which anyone held of us by knight’s service), and concerning\r\n  abbeys founded on other fiefs than our own, in which the lord of the\r\n  fee claims to have right; and when we have returned, or if we desist\r\n  from our expedition, we will immediately grant full justice to all who\r\n  complain of such things.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1019:\r\n\r\n  The words, “_et eodem modo, de justicia exhibenda_,” and “_vel\r\n  remansuris forestis_” are written at the foot of both the Cottonian\r\n  versions. Cf. _supra_, 195, n. They make clear, rather than add to,\r\n  the meaning of the rest.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis chapter makes an advance upon the Articles of the Barons, extending\r\nto three kinds of abuses, not specially mentioned there, the respite\r\nprovided in chapter 52 for redressing acts of illegal disseisin. The\r\n“close time” secured to John in virtue of his crusader’s vow is to cover\r\n(_a_) inquiries into the proper boundaries of forests said to have been\r\nextended by his father or by his brother; (_b_) wardships over the lands\r\nof under-tenants usurped by him by reason of his illegal extension of\r\nprerogative wardship, and (_c_) abbeys founded by mesne lords and seized\r\nby John during vacancies in violation of the rights of wardship of such\r\nfounders.[1020]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1020:\r\n\r\n  It thus supplements three previous chapters (_a_) c. 47; (_b_) c. 37;\r\n  and (_c_) c. 46 respectively.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR.\r\n\r\nNullus capiatur nec imprisonetur propter appellum femine de morte\r\nalterius quam viri sui.\r\n\r\n  No one shall be arrested or imprisoned upon the appeal of a woman, for\r\n  the death of any other than her husband.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of this chapter was to find a remedy for what the barons\r\nevidently considered an unfair advantage enjoyed by women appellants,\r\nwho were allowed to appoint some champion to act for them in the\r\n_duellum_, while the accused man had to fight for himself. The\r\nconnection between appeal and battle, and the distinction between battle\r\nfollowing on appeal and battle on a writ of right, have already been\r\nexplained.[1021] In civil pleas wherein combat was legally competent,\r\nneither party could fight in person: champions were insisted on,\r\nalthough _hired_ champions were condemned. In theory, these men were\r\nwitnesses, each swearing that he had actually seen the seisin—that is,\r\nhad been present at the infeftment of the claimant whose title he\r\nsupported, or at that of his ancestor from whom he inherited the\r\nland.[1022] In criminal pleas, on the other hand, the parties must fight\r\nin their own persons. This distinction is not so illogical as it seems\r\nat first sight, for the appellant was supposed to be an eye-witness of\r\nthe crime[1023]; and the apparent anomaly disappears when both rules of\r\nprocedure are treated as deductions from the principle that the\r\ncombatants in all cases were witnesses whose conflicting testimonies\r\nmust be weighed in the balance of battle, with an overruling Providence\r\nholding the scales.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1021:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, c. 36.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1022:\r\n\r\n  Bracton, _folio_ 151 _b._, cites the case of a champion sentenced to\r\n  mutilation of a foot because he confessed that he was paid to appear,\r\n  and was not really a witness. The Statute of Westminster, I. (3 Edward\r\n  I. c. 41), enacted that champions need not swear to the personal\r\n  knowledge of what they maintained. See also Neilson, _Trial by\r\n  Combat_, 48–51.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1023:\r\n\r\n  The appellant “in all cases except murder, that is, secret homicide,\r\n  made oath as a witness that he had seen and heard the deed.” Neilson,\r\n  _Trial by Combat_, 48.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn a case of murder, no private accuser would be heard unless he alleged\r\nthat he had seen the accused actually do the deed. The stringency of\r\nthis rule was, however, modified by legal fictions. The near relation,\r\nor the feudal lord, of the slain man was treated as constructively\r\npresent at his slaying, because of the closeness of the bond of blood or\r\nof homage between the two. This, at least, is the most plausible\r\ninterpretation of Glanvill’s words: “No one is admissible to prove the\r\naccusation unless he be allied in blood to the deceased or be connected\r\nwith him by the tie of homage or lordship, _so that_ he can speak of the\r\ndeath upon testimony of his own sight.”[1024]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1024:\r\n\r\n  Glanvill, XIV. c. 3.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe rule also which required an appellant to offer proof by his own body\r\nwas relaxed in certain cases; women, men over sixty years of age, and\r\nthose with broken bones or who had lost a limb, an ear, a nose, or an\r\neye, were unable to fight effectively, and might therefore appear by\r\nproxy.[1025] The privilege thus accorded to women was looked on with\r\nmuch disfavour as conferring an unfair advantage as against appellees\r\nwho were not allowed to produce a substitute. Accordingly an option was\r\ngiven the man accused by a woman; he might, in Glanvill’s words, elect\r\neither \"to abide by the woman’s proof or to purge himself by the\r\nordeal.\"[1026] This option was freely used; an appellee in 1201 was\r\nallowed to go to the ordeal of water,[1027] while two years later when\r\nthe widow of a murdered man offered to prove her accusation “as the\r\ncourt shall consider,” the accused was allowed to go to the ordeal, “for\r\nhe has elected to bear the iron.”[1028] After the virtual abolition of\r\nordeal in 1215, appeals by women were usually determined _per patriam_\r\n(that is by the sworn verdict of a jury of neighbours). Such is the\r\ndoctrine of Bracton,[1029] whose authority is amply borne out by\r\nrecorded cases. Thus in 1221, a man accused by a woman of her husband’s\r\nmurder offered fifteen marks for a verdict of the jurors.[1030]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1025:\r\n\r\n  See Bracton, II. ff. 142 _b_, 145 _b_; also Neilson, _Trial by Combat_\r\n  47, and authorities there cited.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1026:\r\n\r\n  Glanvill, XIV. c. 3.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1027:\r\n\r\n  _Sel.

Magna Carta mentions only one of these two grounds of\r\nappeal; but silence on the subject of assault need not be interpreted as\r\nindicating any intention to deprive women of their rights in such\r\ncases.[1031]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1031:\r\n\r\n  The Act 6 Richard II. c. 6, to prevent the wife’s connivance, extended\r\n  the right of appeal in such cases to a woman’s husband, father, or\r\n  other near relative; but denied the appellee’s right to the option of\r\n  defending himself by battle—thus proving no exception to the policy of\r\n  discouraging the _duellum_ wherever possible.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe present chapter of the Great Charter confines itself to appeals of\r\nmurder, declaring that no woman has the right to institute proceedings\r\nin this way for the death of father, son, or friend, but only for that\r\nof her husband. Hard as this rule may seem, the barons here made no\r\nchange on existing law. Glanvill does not seem to recognize the\r\npossibility of a woman’s appeal of homicide save for the death of her\r\nhusband.[1032] He seems to deduce the reason for allowing it in that\r\ncase from the principle already explained: \"A woman is heard in this\r\nsuit accusing anyone of her husband’s death, if she speak as being an\r\neye-witness to the fact, because husband and wife are one flesh\"—another\r\nexample of constructive presence.[1033]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1032:\r\n\r\n  Glanvill, XIV. c. 3.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1033:\r\n\r\n  Glanvill, XIV. c. 33, Fleta I. c. 3, seems by different words to\r\n  indicate only the same doctrine of constructive presence, when he\r\n  speaks in this connection “_de morte viri sui inter brachia sua\r\n  interfecti_,” although laboured explanations of this passage are\r\n  sometimes attempted, _e.g._ Coke, _Second Institute_, 93. Pollock and\r\n  Maitland (I. 468, n.) dismiss the phrase _inter brachia sua_ as \"only\r\n  a picturesque ‘common form.’\"\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no authority whatever for Coke’s hasty inference from\r\nthe provisions of this chapter, that previous to 1215 a woman had an\r\nappeal for the death of any one of her “ancestors.”[1034] The chapter,\r\nin spite of its declaratory nature, seems an ungallant one, indicating\r\nthat the barons were more careful to guard themselves against\r\nunnecessary risk than to champion the cause of defenceless women.[1035]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1034:\r\n\r\n  See Coke, _Second Institute_, p. 68, and contrast Pollock and\r\n  Maitland, I. 468. John’s justices rejected in 1202 a woman’s claim to\r\n  appeal for her father’s death, and some ten years later two other\r\n  claims for the death of sons. See _Select Pleas of the Crown_, Nos.\r\n  32, 117, and 118.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1035:\r\n\r\n  A peculiarity in the wording of this clause should, perhaps, be\r\n  noticed. It restricts explicitly not appeals by women, but merely\r\n  “arrest and imprisonment” following on such.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE.\r\n\r\nOmnes fines qui injuste et contra legem terre facti sunt nobiscum, et\r\nomnia amerciamenta facta injuste et contra legem terre, omnino\r\ncondonentur, vel fiat inde per judicium viginti quinque baronum de\r\nquibus fit mencio inferius in securitate pacis, vel per judicium majoris\r\npartis eorundem, una cum predicto Stephano Cantuariensi archiepiscopo,\r\nsi interesse poterit, et aliis quos secum ad hoc vocare voluerit: et si\r\ninteresse non poterit, nichilominus procedat negocium sine eo, ita quod,\r\nsi aliquis vel aliqui de predictis viginti quinque baronibus fuerint in\r\nsimili querela, amoveantur quantum ad hoc judicium, et alii loco eorum\r\nper residuos de eisdem viginti quinque, tantum ad hoc faciendum electi\r\net jurati substituantur.\r\n\r\n  All fines made with us unjustly and against the law of the land, and\r\n  all amercements imposed unjustly and against the law of the land,\r\n  shall be entirely remitted, or else it shall be done concerning them\r\n  according to the decision of the five-and-twenty barons of whom\r\n  mention is made below in the clause for securing the peace, or\r\n  according to the judgment of the majority of the same, along with the\r\n  aforesaid Stephen, archbishop of Canterbury, if he can be present, and\r\n  such others as he may wish to bring with him for this purpose, and if\r\n  he cannot be present the business shall nevertheless proceed without\r\n  him, provided always that if any one or more of the aforesaid\r\n  five-and-twenty barons are in a similar suit, they shall be removed as\r\n  far as concerns this particular judgment, others being substituted in\r\n  their places after having been selected by the rest of the same\r\n  five-and-twenty for this purpose only, and after having been sworn.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thirty-seventh of the Articles of the Barons, forming the draft of\r\nthis chapter, refers specially to one particular class of illegal fines,\r\nnamely those exacted by John from defenceless widows in return for being\r\nallowed the peaceful enjoyment of their legal rights of property in\r\ntheir own and their husband’s estates (“_pro dotibus, maritagiis, et\r\nhereditatibus_”). It forms thus a natural supplement to chapter 7. The\r\nearlier chapter had confirmed widows in their rights for the future;\r\nthis one remits fines unjustly taken in the past. It is probable that\r\neven the clause of the Articles of the Barons did not intend to limit\r\nits own operation to this one group of unjust fines; and it mentions\r\namercements, without any qualification. In any view, the terms of Magna\r\nCarta were broadened out to embrace illegal fines and amercements of\r\nevery sort.[1036]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1036:\r\n\r\n  In its expanded form the clause becomes a supplement, not merely to c.\r\n  7, but also to cc. 20, 21 and 22 (which defined procedure at\r\n  amercements), and to cc. 36 and 40 (which condemned John’s practice of\r\n  refusing writs and justice until heavy fines were offered for them).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe distinction between fines and amercements, absolute in theory but\r\ntending to become obliterated in practice, has been explained in a\r\nformer chapter.[1037] The system of arbitrary fines, always so galling a\r\nfeature in the Crown’s policy throughout the Middle Ages, culminated in\r\nthe reign of John, whose talents were well suited to the development of\r\nits ingenious and mean details. Dr. Stubbs describes the product of his\r\nlabours as “the system of fines which was elaborated into that minute\r\nand grotesque instrument of torture which all the historians of the\r\nreign have dwelt on in great detail.”[1038] Hallam commented on this in\r\na passage which has become classical. \"The bishop of Winchester paid a\r\nton of good wine for not reminding the king (John) to give a girdle to\r\nthe countess of Albemarle; and Robert de Vaux five best palfreys, that\r\nthe same king might hold his peace about Henry Pinel’s wife. Another\r\npaid four marks for leave to eat (_pro licentia comedendi_).\"[1039]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1037:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, c. 20.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1038:\r\n\r\n  See _Preface_ to W. Coventry, II. lxix.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1039:\r\n\r\n  _Middle Ages_, II. 438. Hallam’s examples are all drawn from Madox, I.\r\n  507-9. Other illustrations of fines and amercements may be found under\r\n  several of the foregoing chapters. Every man who began a plea and lost\r\n  it, or abandoned it, was amerced.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nUnique procedure was provided by the present chapter for deciding\r\ndisputes as to the legality of fines and amercements. Authority to\r\ndecide was vested in a board of arbitrators to consist of thirteen or\r\nmore of the twenty-five executors, together with Stephen Langton and\r\nsuch others as he chose to summon. No mention is made of the maximum\r\nnumber whom the primate might thus nominate, and there is no attempt to\r\ndefine their powers relative to those of the other members of the board,\r\na somewhat unbusinesslike omission, but one which testifies to the great\r\nconfidence placed in Langton by those who approved its terms. Care is\r\ntaken to prevent such members of the twenty-five as were likely to be\r\nbiased from sitting in judgments on suits like their own—a stipulation\r\nwhich might with advantage have been extended to several other chapters.\r\n\r\nThis chapter, like others addressed to the special circumstances of\r\nJohn’s reign, found no echo in future charters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER FIFTY-SIX.\r\n\r\nSi nos disseisivimus vel elongavimus Walenses de terris vel libertatibus\r\nvel rebus aliis, sine legali judicio parium suorum, in Anglia vel in\r\nWallia,[1040] eis statim reddantur; et si contencio super hoc orta\r\nfuerit, tunc inde fiat in marchia per judicium parium suorum, de\r\ntenementis Anglie secundum legem Anglie, de tenementis Wallie secundum\r\nlegem Wallie, de tenementis marchie secundum legem marchie. Idem facient\r\nWalenses nobis et nostris.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1040:\r\n\r\n  The words “_in Anglia vel in Wallia_” are written at the foot of one\r\n  of the Cottonian versions, (cf. _supra_, 195, n.); but their omission\r\n  from their proper place is clearly a clerical error, since they appear\r\n  _in situ_ in the Articles of the Barons.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n  If we have disseised or removed Welshmen from lands or liberties, or\r\n  other things, without the legal judgment of their peers in England or\r\n  in Wales, they shall be immediately restored to them; and if a dispute\r\n  arise over this, then let it be decided in the marches by the judgment\r\n  of their peers; for tenements in England according to the law of\r\n  England, for tenements in Wales according to the law of Wales, and for\r\n  tenements in the marches according to the law of the marches. Welshmen\r\n  shall do the same to us and ours.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the first of three chapters directed towards redressing wrongs\r\nsuffered by Welshmen: and the three taken together testify to the\r\nimportance attached by the barons to the value of the Welsh alliance.\r\nRestoration is to be made (_a_) of illegal disseisins effected by John\r\n(chapter 56); (_b_) of those effected by Henry II. and Richard I.\r\n(chapter 57); and (_c_) of hostages and charters delivered to John as\r\npledges of peace (chapter 58).\r\n\r\nThe present chapter does for Welshmen what the first part of chapter 52\r\nhad already done for Englishmen. The reasons for treating Welshmen\r\nseparately were probably twofold, partly for the sake of emphasis, and\r\npartly because some slight differences of detail were required.\r\n“Judgment of peers,” indeed, was applied to both cases, but for the\r\ndispossessed Welshmen, “_in marchia per judicium parium suorum_” takes\r\nthe place of the “_per judicium viginti quinque baronum_” provided for\r\nEnglishmen in like case. The “venue” was thus apparently fixed in the\r\nmarchland for all Welshmen’s cases, although three different kinds of\r\nlaw were to be applied according to the situation of the property in\r\ndispute. This clear indication of the existence of three distinct bodies\r\nof law, one for England, another for Wales, and a third for the marches,\r\nshows that the unifying task of the common law had not yet been\r\ncompleted. Interesting questions of a nature analogous to those treated\r\nby the branch of modern jurisprudence known as International Private Law\r\nmust constantly have arisen. The “peers” of a Welshman were not defined;\r\nbut a court composed of Welsh barons or freeholders was probably meant.\r\n\r\nThe final words of the chapter, declaring that Welshmen were to afford\r\nreciprocal redress to John and his subjects, are interesting, since they\r\nimply that Welshmen had, in some cases, successfully seized lands\r\nclaimed by Englishmen. Here, as usual, the barons were mainly interested\r\nin securing their own rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN.\r\n\r\nDe omnibus autem illis de quibus aliquis Walensium disseisitus fuerit\r\nvel elongatus sine legali judicio parium suorum per Henricum regem\r\npatrem nostrum vel Ricardum regem fratrem nostrum, que nos in manu\r\nnostra habemus, vel que alii tenent que nos oporteat warantizare,\r\nrespectum habebimus usque ad communem terminum crucesignatorum, illis\r\nexceptis de quibus placitum motum fuit vel inquisicio facta per\r\npreceptum nostrum ante suscepcionem crucis nostre: cum autem redierimus,\r\nvel si forte remanserimus a peregrinacione nostra, statim eis inde\r\nplenam justiciam exhibebimus, secundum leges Walensium et partes\r\npredictas.\r\n\r\n  Further, for all those possessions from which any Welshman has,\r\n  without the lawful judgment of his peers, been disseised or removed by\r\n  King Henry our father, or King Richard our brother, and which we\r\n  retain in our hand (or which are possessed by others, to whom we are\r\n  bound to warrant them) we shall have respite until the usual term of\r\n  crusaders; excepting those things about which a plea has been raised\r\n  or an inquest made by our order before we took the cross; but as soon\r\n  as we return, (or if perchance we desist from our expedition), we will\r\n  immediately grant full justice in accordance with the laws of the\r\n  Welsh and in relation to the foresaid regions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe provisions here made for restoring to Welshmen estates of which they\r\nhad been unjustly dispossessed by Henry or Richard are expressed in\r\nterms identical with the similar provisions made in the latter part of\r\nchapter 52 for Englishmen in like case, except for the last words, “in\r\naccordance with the laws of the Welsh in relation to the aforesaid\r\ndistricts,” indicating the three systems of law referred to in the\r\nprevious chapter. No machinery is here specified for declaring or\r\napplying that law; the need for this indeed had been rendered remote by\r\nJohn’s success before the arbitrators who determined that a crusader’s\r\nprivilege should be accorded him.[1041]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1041:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, c. 52.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Articles of the Barons had, however, mentioned the procedure to be\r\nadopted; and a comparison of the terms of articles 25 and 44 with those\r\nof chapter 57 of the Charter suggests the antithesis between “_per\r\njudicium parium suorum in curia regis_” for Englishmen in such cases,\r\nand “_in marchia per judicium parium suorum_” for Welshmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER FIFTY-EIGHT.\r\n\r\nNos reddemus filium Lewelini statim, et omnes obsides de Wallia, et\r\ncartas que nobis liberate fuerunt in securitatem pacis.\r\n\r\n  We will immediately give up the son of Llywelyn and all the hostages\r\n  of Wales, and the charters delivered to us as security for the peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe treatment of hostages in general and Welsh hostages in particular\r\nhas already been fully illustrated.[1042] The patent and close rolls of\r\nthe reign show a constant coming and going of these living pledges of\r\nthe peace. A writ of 18th December, 1214, for example, bade Engelard de\r\nCygony restore three Welsh nobles to Llywelyn.[1043] Since then, new\r\nhostages, including Llywelyn’s own son, had been handed over; and\r\ncharters also had apparently been pledged. John now promised\r\nunconditionally to restore all of these; and the Welsh Prince must have\r\nbreathed more freely when this was fulfilled, allowing him, his son by\r\nhis side, with a light heart to prepare for the hostilities against the\r\nEnglish Crown, long seen to be inevitable and now to be resumed in\r\nalliance with the disaffected English barons.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1042:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, p. 517.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1043:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, p. 520.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Articles of the Barons had to some extent treated this question of\r\nthe Welsh hostages and charters as an open one, referring its final\r\ndetermination to the arbitration of Stephen Langton and such others as\r\nhe might nominate to act with him. The point had apparently been decided\r\nin favour of the Welsh before the Charter was engrossed in its final\r\nform.[1044]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1044:\r\n\r\n  No. 45 of the Articles of the Barons is connected by a rude bracket\r\n  with No. 46 (relating to the king of Scotland); and a saving clause,\r\n  thus made applicable to both, is added with some appearance of haste:\r\n  “_nisi aliter esse debeat per cartas quas rex habet, per judicium\r\n  archiepiscopi et aliorum quos secum vocare voluerit_.” Cf. _supra_,\r\n  202. So far as related to Scotch affairs, the king’s _caveat_ found\r\n  its way, although in an altered form, into Magna Carta. See c.59.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER FIFTY-NINE.\r\n\r\nNos faciemus Alexandro regi Scottorum de sororibus suis, et obsidibus\r\nreddendis, et libertatibus suis, et jure suo, secundum formam in qua\r\nfaciemus aliis baronibus nostris Anglie, nisi aliter esse debeat per\r\ncartas quas habemus de Willelmo patre ipsius, quondam rege Scottorum; et\r\nhoc erit per judicium parium suorum in curia nostra.\r\n\r\n  We will do toward Alexander, King of Scots, concerning the return of\r\n  his sisters and his hostages, and concerning his franchises, and his\r\n  right, in the same manner as we shall do towards our other barons of\r\n  England, unless it ought to be otherwise according to the charters\r\n  which we hold from William his father, formerly King of Scots; and\r\n  this shall be according to the judgment of his peers in our court.\r\n\r\n\r\nA heterogeneous body of forces was drawn into temporary union by common\r\nhatred of John. The barons welcomed allies whether from Wales or from\r\nScotland; if the three preceding chapters were a bid for Llywelyn’s\r\nsupport, this one was dictated by a desire to conciliate Alexander. John\r\nwas forced to promise to restore to the king of Scots his sisters and\r\nother hostages, together with his franchises and his “right.” This last\r\nword covered Alexander’s claim to independence and also whatever title\r\nhe might prove good to various English fiefs which he claimed to hold\r\nunder the English Crown.\r\n\r\nOpinions have been, and still are, sharply divided as to whether, or in\r\nwhat degree, Scotland was subject to feudal overlordship. Of one fact\r\nthere can be no doubt; David I. and his successors, kings of Scotland,\r\nhad been wont to do fealty and homage to the kings of England; but this\r\nfact has received widely different interpretations. Such homage, it is\r\nargued, was performed in respect of certain English baronies which\r\nhappened to belong by hereditary right to the kings of Scotland, namely,\r\nthe earldom of Huntingdon, the isolated position of which enabled the\r\nEnglish Crown without danger to admit the claim, and the counties of\r\nNorthumberland, Cumberland, and Westmoreland, the proximity of which to\r\nthe border rendered their possession by a Scottish prince a source of\r\nweakness to England.[1045] The terms in which the oath of homage was\r\ntaken did not indicate for what fiefs it was sworn—whether for the\r\nEnglish earldoms alone, or for the whole country north of Tweed as well.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1045:\r\n\r\n  See Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, I. 596.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe position of the kings of Scots remained ambiguous in this respect,\r\nuntil William the Lion was placed at a terrible disadvantage by his\r\ncapture at Alnwick in 1174, after supporting the rebellion against Henry\r\nII. To gain his release he ratified the Treaty of Falaise on 8th\r\nDecember, of that year, by which he agreed in future to hold all his\r\nterritories as fiefs of the English Crown. All his tenants in Scotland\r\nwere to take a direct oath to Henry; while hostages were surrendered\r\nalong with the castles of Berwick, Roxburgh, Jedburgh, Edinburgh, and\r\nStirling.[1046]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1046:\r\n\r\n  See Ramsay, _Angevin Empire_, 183–4. In the spring of 1185, Henry\r\n  confirmed William’s claim to the Earldom of Huntingdon, and the Scots\r\n  king, prior to Christmas, 1186, transferred it to his brother David.\r\n  _Ibid._, 226, n.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis notable achievement of Henry’s diplomacy was, like other portions\r\nof his life’s work, undone by his successor. Richard, preparing for his\r\ncrusade of 1190, sold recklessly every right that would fetch a price:\r\nWilliam bought back the independence of his ancient kingdom; but this\r\nrestoration of the relations that had prevailed previous to 1174,\r\ninvolved a restoration of all the old ambiguities. When Richard died,\r\nWilliam despatched ambassadors to England, pressing his claims upon the\r\nnorthern counties, promising to support John’s title in return for their\r\nadmission, and adding threats.[1047]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1047:\r\n\r\n  See Miss Norgate, _John Lackland_, 66.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nJohn avoided committing himself to a definite answer until his position\r\nin England was assured; thereafter he commanded William to do homage\r\nunconditionally. The Scots king disregarded the first summons, but\r\nyielded to a second, taking the oath in public on the summit of the hill\r\nof Lincoln, on 21st November, 1200, “reserving always his own\r\nright.”[1048] The saving clause left everything vague as before.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1048:\r\n\r\n  See Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, I. 596, n., and Norgate, _John Lackland_,\r\n  73, 78. Cf. the words “_salvo jure suo_” with the “_et jure suo_” of\r\n  Magna Carta.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn April, 1209, the king of Scots incurred John’s displeasure by\r\nsheltering bishops who had supported the policy of Rome in the matter of\r\nthe interdict. William’s only son, Alexander, was demanded as a hostage,\r\nor alternatively three border castles must be delivered up. After a\r\nrefusal, the old king gave in on 7th August, 1209.[1049] Alexander did\r\nhomage on behalf of his father “for the aforesaid castles and other\r\nlands which he held,” and found sureties for the payment of 15,000\r\nmarks. William’s daughters, Margaret and Isabel (the two ladies referred\r\nto in Magna Carta) became the wards of John, who had the right to bestow\r\nthem in marriage—stipulations which come suspiciously near an admission\r\nof feudal vassalage.[1050] There seems, however, to have been some\r\nunderstanding that one of them should wed John’s eldest son.[1051]\r\nMargaret and Isabel, though kept virtually as prisoners in Corfe Castle,\r\nDorset, were yet honourably and kindly treated there. The Close Rolls of\r\nthe reign contain several entries (which read strangely enough among the\r\nsterner memorials of John’s diplomacy) containing orders for supplying\r\nthem with articles of comfort and luxury. Thus on 6th July, 1213, John,\r\nbusy as he must have been with affairs of state, instructed the Mayor of\r\nWinchester to despatch in haste for the use of his niece Eleanor and of\r\nthe two Scots princesses robes of dark green (tunics and super-tunics)\r\nwith capes of cambric and fur of miniver, together with twenty-three\r\nyards of good linen cloth, with light shoes for summer wear, “and the\r\nMayor is to come himself with all the above articles to Corfe, there to\r\nreceive the money for the cost of the same.”[1052] Margaret and Isabel\r\nhad no reason to complain of such treatment, whatever thoughts the Mayor\r\nof Winchester may have had of so liberal an interpretation of his civic\r\nduties.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1049:\r\n\r\n  _New Rymer_, I. 103, where “Northampton” is apparently a mistake for\r\n  “Norham.” See Ramsay, _Angevin Empire_, 421, n.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1050:\r\n\r\n  Ramsay, _Ibid._, and authorities there cited.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1051:\r\n\r\n  Ramsay, _Angevin Empire_, 421, and authorities.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1052:\r\n\r\n  _Rot. Claus._, I. 144, and I. 157. This Eleanor was the sister of\r\n  Prince Arthur. The fortunes of war had in 1202 placed both of them in\r\n  John’s hands. Arthur disappeared—murdered it was supposed; Eleanor\r\n  remained a prisoner for life; the Scots princesses were virtually her\r\n  fellow-prisoners for a time in Corfe Castle.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, events in Scotland had favoured English pretensions. In the\r\nyear 1212, William, now in advanced age, although his son was still a\r\nstripling, was compelled by internal troubles to appeal for aid to John.\r\nCuthred, a claimant for the Scottish throne as a descendant of Donald\r\nBane MacWilliam, having acquired a considerable following in Scotland,\r\nendeavoured to dethrone King William; and his attempt seemed likely to\r\nsucceed, when English succour was asked and paid for by a Treaty signed\r\nat Norham on 7th February, 1212. By this, William granted to John the\r\nright to marry the young Alexander, then fourteen years of age, “_sicut\r\nhominem suum ligium_,” to whomsoever he would, at any time within the\r\nnext six years, but always \"without disparagement\"—a phrase already\r\nexplained.[1053] William further pledged himself and his son to keep\r\nfaith and allegiance to John’s son, Henry, “as their liege lord” against\r\nall mortals.[1054] The young Scottish prince thereafter journeyed\r\nsouthwards in the train of John, by whom he was knighted on the 4th of\r\nMarch at London. In June an English army entered Scotland; the pretender\r\nwas defeated and killed. William had saved his Crown, but his\r\nindependence was impaired. Scotland was gradually sinking into the\r\nposition of a vassal state. This was recognized at Rome. On 28th\r\nOctober, 1213, Innocent III., among other healing measures consequent on\r\nJohn’s surrender of his kingdom, ordered the king of Scotland and his\r\nson to show fealty and devotion to John, in terms similar to those\r\naddressed to the English barons.[1055]\r\n\r\nWilliam the Lion died at Stirling on 4th December, 1214, and Alexander\r\nwas crowned at Scone two days later,[1056] his peaceful succession being\r\nfacilitated by the knowledge that he had the support of John. On 28th\r\nApril, 1215, the English king, already deep in his quarrel with the\r\nbarons, acknowledged receipt of Thomas Colville and other Scotsmen as\r\nhostages.[1057] Such was the position of affairs when John was brought\r\nto bay at Runnymede. The barons were willing to bid for the alliance of\r\nAlexander; yet it was unnecessary to bid high, since his unsatisfied\r\nclaims on the northern counties predisposed him against the English\r\nking. The barons, therefore, did nothing calculated to endanger such\r\nhold as England had over the Scottish Crown. John promised to restore\r\nAlexander’s sisters and other hostages unconditionally, but used words\r\nwhich committed him on none of the disputed points.[1058] Franchises and\r\n“right” were to be restored only in so far as accorded with the terms of\r\nKing William’s “charters” as interpreted by the judgment of the English\r\nbarons in the court of the English king.[1059]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1053:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, c. 6.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1054:\r\n\r\n  _New Rymer_, I. 104.

Both found permanent homes in England—Margaret\r\n  as wife of Hubert de Burgh, Earl of Kent (mentioned in preamble of\r\n  Magna Carta); Isabel as wife of Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk (one of\r\n  the Charter’s executors). See Ramsay, _Angevin Empire_, 421, and\r\n  authorities there cited.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1059:\r\n\r\n  This reference to charters was probably intended to cover (_a_) the\r\n  Treaty of Falaise, (_b_) the agreement of 7th August, 1209, and (_c_)\r\n  the writ of 7th February, 1212, with the other charters to which it\r\n  refers. It called itself a charter, and suggested others by the words\r\n  _hinc et inde_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe allusion to the Scottish king as one among “our other barons of\r\nEngland” need not be pressed against Alexander any more than similar\r\nexpressions should be pressed against John, whose position as Duke of\r\nNormandy and Aquitaine in no way made England a fief of the French\r\nCrown. In questions affecting his feudal position in France, John’s\r\npeers were the dukes and counts of that country; and similarly those who\r\nhad a right to sit in judgment as Alexander’s peers over his claims to\r\nEnglish fiefs were the English earls and barons. Such a tribunal was not\r\nlikely to give decisions favourable to Scots pretensions at the expense\r\nof England.[1060]\r\n\r\nAlexander, though no party to the treaty at Runnymede, was willing to\r\nextract such benefit from it as he could. Accordingly, on 7th July,\r\n1215, he despatched the Archbishop of St. Andrews and five laymen to\r\nJohn “concerning our business which we have against you to be transacted\r\nin your court.”[1061] Nothing came of this; and when the civil war began\r\nAlexander invaded England in order to push his claims. John swore his\r\nusual oath, \"by God’s teeth,\" that he would “chase the little red-haired\r\nfox-cub from his hiding holes.”[1062] Neither Alexander’s participation\r\nin the war nor the subsequent efforts of diplomacy achieved settlement\r\nof the questions in dispute. None of the latent ambiguities had been\r\nfinally removed when the relations between the two countries entered on\r\na new phase as a consequence of the attempts at annexation made by\r\nEdward I., “the hammer of the Scots.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1060:\r\n\r\n  No. 46 of the Articles of the Barons (as qualified by the clause in\r\n  the bracket) referred the question of Alexander’s “right” in reference\r\n  to his father’s charters to the judgment of Langton and his nominees,\r\n  for which Magna Carta substituted “judgment of his peers in our\r\n  court.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 1061:\r\n\r\n  _New Rymer_, I. 135.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1062:\r\n\r\n  Matthew Paris, _Chron. Maj._, II. 642: “_Sic fugabimus rubeam\r\n  vulpeculam de latibulis suis_.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER SIXTY.\r\n\r\nOmnes autem istas consuetudines predictas et libertates quas nos\r\nconcessimus in regno nostro tenendas quantum ad nos pertinet erga\r\nnostros, omnes de regno nostro, tam clerici quam laici, observent\r\nquantum ad se pertinet erga suos.\r\n\r\n  Moreover, all the aforesaid customs and liberties, the observance of\r\n  which we have granted in our kingdom as far as pertains to us towards\r\n  our men, shall be observed by all of our kingdom, as well clergy as\r\n  laymen, as far as pertains to them towards their men.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would have been as impolitic as it was obviously unfair for the\r\nbarons, in their capacity of mesne lords, to inflict upon their own\r\ntenants—the men without whose support they would have been powerless at\r\nRunnymede—those very exactions which they compelled the king to abjure\r\nas against themselves. Accordingly, the benefit of the same “customs and\r\nliberties” conceded by John to his feudal tenants was—in a somewhat\r\nperfunctory manner it is true—extended also to the feudal tenants of all\r\nother magnates, whether cleric or lay. Although the reference to\r\n“customs and liberties” was quite general in its terms, it seems natural\r\nto infer that feudal grievances were chiefly, if not exclusively,\r\nintended, since the view of society indicated is feudal rather than\r\nnational, and this is quite in keeping with many other clauses of the\r\nCharter.\r\n\r\nThese considerations suggest that too wide and liberal a view has\r\nsometimes been taken of the scope of this chapter. Coke treated it as\r\naffecting not merely freeholders, but the whole mass of the people, and\r\nas enunciating a doctrine of mutual responsibility between the king and\r\nhis subjects. “This is the chief felicity of a kingdom, when good laws\r\nare reciprocally of prince and people (as is here undertaken) duly\r\nobserved.”[1063] In this view he has had many followers, and the present\r\nchapter has received undue emphasis as supporting a democratic\r\ninterpretation of Magna Carta.[1064] It has sometimes been referred to\r\nas “the only clause which affects the whole body of the people.”[1065]\r\nThe better view is that its provisions were confined to freeholders.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1063:\r\n\r\n  _Second Institute_, 77.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1064:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, 133–4.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1065:\r\n\r\n  Thomson, _Magna Charta_, 269, and authorities there cited.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nEven authors who interpret the chapter in this restricted application\r\nare still prone to exaggerate its importance. Two opposite lines of\r\ncomment, in favour respectively with historians of two different\r\nschools, seem equally in need of supplement. (1) This clause is\r\nsometimes regarded as springing directly from the barons’ own\r\nuncontrolled initiative. Dr. Stubbs takes this view, contrasting its\r\nsubstance with similar restraints imposed by Henry I. on the barons by\r\nhis Charter of Liberties, and emphasizing as specially notable the fact\r\nthat the present clause was “adopted by the lords themselves.”[1066]\r\nSuch praise is unmerited; the barons had no option, since the omission\r\nof provisions to this effect would have been a glaring absurdity and a\r\nmost imprudent act. (2) On the other hand, credit for the clause,\r\nequally unwarranted, has been sometimes bestowed on John. Dr. Robert\r\nHenry says that “this article, which was highly reasonable, was probably\r\ninserted at the desire of the king.”[1067]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1066:\r\n\r\n  _Const. Hist._, I. 570. Cf. _supra_, 139–140.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1067:\r\n\r\n  _History of Great Britain_, VI. 74. (6th edition, 1823). See also S.\r\n  Henshall, _History of South Britain_, cited by Thomson, _Magna\r\n  Charta_, 268-9.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe substance of this chapter appears in the reissues of 1217 and 1225;\r\nbut its force is there greatly impaired by the addition of a new clause\r\ninconsistent with its spirit, reserving to archbishops, bishops, abbots,\r\npriors, templars, hospitallers, earls, barons, and all other persons as\r\nwell ecclesiastical as secular, all the franchises and free customs they\r\npreviously had.[1068] The chief object of this was presumably to make it\r\nclear that Magna Carta, while conferring benefits, took nothing away;\r\nbut it would naturally be interpreted as a saving clause in favour of\r\naristocrats in their relations with their dependants (“_erga suos_”) as\r\nwell as with the Crown, thus modifying the clause which immediately\r\npreceded it.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1068:\r\n\r\n  See c. 46 of 1217.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1069:\r\n\r\n  The words “_in perpetuum_” are written at the foot of one of the\r\n  Cottonian versions.

And if we shall not have\r\n  corrected the transgression (or, in the event of our being out of the\r\n  realm, if our justiciar shall not have corrected it) within forty\r\n  days, reckoning from the time it has been intimated to us (or to our\r\n  justiciar, if we should be out of the realm), the four barons\r\n  aforesaid shall refer that matter to the rest of the five-and-twenty\r\n  barons, and those five-and-twenty barons shall, together with the\r\n  community of the whole land, distrain and distress us in all possible\r\n  ways, namely, by seizing our castles, lands, possessions, and in any\r\n  other way they can, until redress has been obtained as they deem fit,\r\n  saving harmless our own person, and the persons of our queen and\r\n  children; and when redress has been obtained, they shall resume their\r\n  old relations towards us. And let whoever in the country desires it,\r\n  swear to obey the orders of the said five-and twenty barons for the\r\n  execution of all the aforesaid matters, and along with them, to molest\r\n  us to the utmost of his power; and we publicly and freely grant leave\r\n  to every one who wishes to swear, and we shall never forbid anyone to\r\n  swear. All those, moreover, in the land who of themselves and of their\r\n  own accord are unwilling to swear to the twenty-five to help them in\r\n  constraining and molesting us, we shall by our command compel the same\r\n  to swear to the effect foresaid. And if any one of the five-and-twenty\r\n  barons shall have died or departed from the land, or be incapacitated\r\n  in any other manner which would prevent the foresaid provisions being\r\n  carried out, those of the said twenty-five barons who are left shall\r\n  choose another in his place according to their own judgment, and he\r\n  shall be sworn in the same way as the others. Further, in all matters\r\n  the execution of which is entrusted to these twenty-five barons, if\r\n  perchance these twenty-five are present and disagree about anything,\r\n  or if some of them, after being summoned, are unwilling or unable to\r\n  be present, that which the majority of those present ordain or command\r\n  shall be held as fixed and established, exactly as if the whole\r\n  twenty-five had concurred in this; and the said twenty-five shall\r\n  swear that they will faithfully observe all that is aforesaid, and\r\n  cause it to be observed with all their might. And we shall procure\r\n  nothing from anyone, directly or indirectly, whereby any part of these\r\n  concessions and liberties might be revoked or diminished; and if any\r\n  such thing has been procured, let it be void and null, and we shall\r\n  never use it personally or by another.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis important chapter stands by itself, providing machinery for\r\nenforcing all that precedes it. It thus forms what modern jurisprudence\r\nwould describe as the “sanction” of the whole, but what was known in the\r\ncurrent phrase of its own day as “the form of security” (_forma\r\nsecuritatis ad observandum pacem et libertates_).[1070] It contains the\r\nonly executive clause of the Charter, the sole constitutional machinery\r\nprovided for enforcing the rights now defined on parchment, the sole\r\nprotection against future attempts of the king to render them of no\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1070:\r\n\r\n  This phrase occurs in the 49th (and last) of the Articles of the\r\n  Barons as the title of a clause which is separated from the others by\r\n  a blank on the parchment of the width of several lines of writing:\r\n  “_Haec est forma securitatis_,” etc. The words are not used as a\r\n  heading in the present chapter itself, but c. 52 refers to c. 61 as\r\n  the clause “_in securitate pacis_,” and c. 62 refers to the same as\r\n  “_super securitate ista_.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI. _The Nature of the “Security” or legal Sanction._ The procedure\r\ndevised for enforcing the Charter was exceedingly crude: John conferred\r\nupon twenty-five of his most bitter enemies a legal right to organize\r\nrebellion, whenever in their opinion he had broken one of the provisions\r\nof Magna Carta. Violence might be legally used against him, until he\r\nredressed their alleged grievances “to their own satisfaction”\r\n(_secundum arbitrium eorum_). If it had been possible to put so violent\r\nan expedient in practice, the “sovereignty,” or supreme power in\r\nEngland, would have been split into two for practical purposes. While\r\nthe old monarchy remained theoretically intact, John would have held the\r\nsceptre, still nominally his, only until his opponents declared that he\r\nhad broken some part of the Charter, when, by his own previously-granted\r\nmandate, it would pass, along with wide powers of coercion, to the\r\ntwenty-five barons forming what is sometimes described as a Committee of\r\nExecutors, but which was rather a Committee of Rebellion.[1071] Instead\r\nof using, as was afterwards done with steadily increasing success, the\r\nking’s own administrative machinery and his own servants to restrain his\r\nown misdeeds, the barons preferred to set up a rival executive of their\r\nown, with wide but ill-defined powers, and connected with the older\r\nexecutive by no constitutional bonds. So long as a single alleged\r\ngrievance remained unredressed, a new administration composed of John’s\r\npolitical antagonists existed in an attitude of, at best, armed\r\nneutrality, side by side with King John as the representative of the\r\nolder system of monarchic administration.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1071:\r\n\r\n  Cf. S. R. Gardiner, _Short History of England_, 183: “a permanent\r\n  organization for making war against the king.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe procedure for redressing grievances was described in some detail;\r\nthe wronged party must make known his case to four barons of the\r\ntwenty-five, and these would then personally make it known to the king,\r\nand ask redress. John was allowed time to effect this, but if he refused\r\nor delayed, then compulsion might be used. The Articles of the Barons\r\nhad left the maximum term of delay unspecified, merely saying “within a\r\nreasonable time to be determined in the Charter.” The Charter did\r\ndetermine this, naming forty days. Compulsion might take any form (for\r\nexample seizure of castles, lands, and personal estate), except violence\r\nagainst the person of the king, or against his wife or children. The\r\npresent chapter, then, contained the only legal sanction mentioned in\r\nthe Charter, and this may be briefly summarized as the delegation by\r\nJohn to a revolutionary committee of the baronial opposition, of wide\r\npowers of coercion to be used against him.\r\n\r\nII. _Minor Details of the Scheme._ Although the whole expedient seems\r\nutterly chimerical to the modern mind, the opposition leaders in 1215\r\nevidently thought they had devised a practicable scheme of government.\r\nThis is shown by the care with which they elaborated the procedure to be\r\nadopted at different stages and in various contingencies.\r\n\r\n(1) _Appointment of the twenty-five executors._ The members of the\r\ncommittee were to be, in the first instance, “elected” (a loose word\r\nalready discussed) by the “barons.” The _majores barones_ of chapter 14\r\nwould undoubtedly have the controlling voice; but the _minores barones_\r\nmight possibly have taken some share in the appointment. Vacancies which\r\noccurred through death, absence from England, or any other cause, were\r\nto be filled by the method now known as “co-optation.” The committee,\r\nonce appointed, would form a close corporation; no one uncongenial to\r\nthe majority could gain admission—an arrangement with a thoroughly\r\noligarchic flavour. The provision for supplying vacancies caused by\r\ndeath proves that the scheme was not to be temporary, but to last during\r\nJohn’s lifetime or longer. Twenty-five magnates seem to have been\r\nactually selected. The writs issued to the Sheriffs on 19th June command\r\nthe enforcement of the oath to the twenty-five barons, but do not\r\nmention them by name. Matthew Paris supplies the omission, and though he\r\ndoes not disclose the source of his information, it is unlikely that so\r\ncomprehensive a list could be entirely a work of the imagination.[1072]\r\nThey occur in the following order, the earls of Hertford, Aumâle,\r\nGloucester, Winchester, Hereford, Norfolk, and Oxford, William Marshall\r\nthe younger, Robert fitz Walter the elder, Gilbert de Clare, Eustace de\r\nVesci, Hugh Bigod, William of Mowbray, William Hardell (Mayor of\r\nLondon), William de Lanvalei, Robert de Ros, John de Lacy (Constable of\r\nChester), Richard de Perci, John fitz Robert, William Mallet, Geoffrey\r\nde Say, Roger de Mumbezon, William of Huntingfield, Richard de\r\nMuntfitchet, and William of Albini.[1073] There are here no churchmen\r\nand no members of the moderate party whose names appear in the preamble.\r\nAll except two, or at the most three, of the twenty-five were drawn from\r\nthose factions of the baronage who were the declared enemies of\r\nJohn.[1074] It was an oligarchy of disaffected Crown tenants, whose\r\nbaronial homogeneity was only broken by the presence of one\r\nrepresentative of other classes, the Mayor of London. Such a committee\r\nwas not likely to use the excessive powers delegated to it by John to\r\nfurther any other interests than its own. Even Stephen Langton and his\r\nfellow-prelates were soon to discover this, as the two protests issued\r\nby them clearly prove.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1072:\r\n\r\n  R. Wendover, from whom Paris borrows so freely, gives no list.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1073:\r\n\r\n  The list is taken from Matthew Paris, _Chron. Maj._, II. 604-5, as\r\n  corrected by Blackstone, _Great Charter_, p. xx., after collation with\r\n  a marginal note on the Harleian MS. of the charter (cf. _supra_, 198,\r\n  n). Paris gives “Boys” in place of “Ros,” and “Roger de Munbrai” in\r\n  place of “Roger of Mumbezon.” This list should be contrasted with\r\n  (_a_) that of the moderate party named in the preamble to Magna Carta,\r\n  and (_b_) that of John’s foreign favourites named in c. 50. For\r\n  biographical information, see Thomson, _Magna Charta_, 270–312.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1074:\r\n\r\n  These three were Earl Aumâle (a title apparently sometimes exchanged\r\n  for that of Earl of York, see Round, _Geoffrey de Mandeville_, 157,\r\n  n.), William of Albini, and, possibly, Geoffrey de Say (see Stubbs,\r\n  _Const. Hist._, I. 583).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(2) _A majority of those present to form a quorum._ Driven by the\r\nnecessities of the case, the barons devised, or stumbled upon, a\r\npeculiarly modern expedient. The presence of every member of the\r\ncommittee of twenty-five could not reasonably be expected upon every\r\noccasion, while absolute unanimity on questions of delicacy would be\r\ndifficult to obtain. It was provided, accordingly, that the will of the\r\nmajority of those present should prevail. It would be inaccurate to say,\r\nin modern phraseology, that thirteen formed a quorum, since the quorum\r\nvaried with the number of those present. It is notable that no provision\r\nwas made for summoning or constituting meetings of the committee endowed\r\nwith these tremendous powers. Room was thus left for packed meetings of\r\none faction being hurriedly convened and usurping the rights of the\r\nwhole body. The precedent thus tentatively introduced for the right of a\r\nmajority to act for the whole was followed only timidly and at long\r\nintervals. Still, its appearance in John’s Charter marks a stage in the\r\nadvance of the valuable principle of modern politics which substitutes\r\nthe “counting of heads for the breaking of them.”\r\n\r\n(3) _The sub-committee of four._ Four of the twenty-five Executors were\r\nto act as a medium of intercourse between aggrieved individuals and the\r\nking, being charged with the duty of hearing complaints and laying them\r\nbefore John. Such a position would involve wide discretionary powers;\r\nfor if the four barons refused to endorse the justice of the complaint,\r\nJohn also would be in safety to refuse.[1075]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1075:\r\n\r\n  An alternative explanation is also possible, namely, that the function\r\n  of intermediary might be exercised by any four members of the\r\n  twenty-five. In that view, an aggrieved individual might have pressure\r\n  placed upon the king if he persuaded any four to act together in\r\n  support of his claim. This would imply a second quorum, this time of\r\n  four, for a special purpose, in addition to the quorum of varying\r\n  numbers already discussed. In either view, the road to redress would\r\n  be easier for the great man than for his obscure neighbour.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(4) _Local agents of the twenty-five executors._ In each county the\r\ntwelve knights, whose original function was to preside at inquiries into\r\n“evil customs,” came to act as the local representatives of the\r\nrevolutionary committee, being associated with the sheriff in the\r\ndischarge of all his duties and armed with power to constrain him to\r\ncarry out the provisions of Magna Carta, very much as the twenty-five\r\nwere authorized to constrain the king. In particular, these knights were\r\ncharged with the enforcement of the oath of obedience to the\r\nrevolutionary committee, and with the confiscation of the property of\r\nall who refused.[1076]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1076:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, c. 48.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(5) _The part to be played by the public._ The king authorized his\r\nsubjects to side with the executors and against him if he should violate\r\nthe Charter, and to assist them in such acts of violence as the forcible\r\nseizure of his castles, lands, and personal estate; for his general\r\nmandate was granted to the twenty-five “_cum communa totius terre_,”\r\nwhile licence was “freely and publicly” bestowed on everyone so disposed\r\nto swear obedience to the Executors in all such acts, and to bring their\r\nweight to bear on the king to the best of their ability. Two aspects of\r\nthis provision require special attention: (_a_) _Its relation to\r\nallegiance and treason._ It was intended to operate as a provisional\r\nrelease of John’s subjects from their oaths of fealty and homage, and\r\nconsequently from the pains and penalties of the treason laws. John\r\nsolemnly authorized his subjects, in certain circumstances, to transfer\r\ntheir allegiance from himself to the committee of his foes. If they\r\nrefused, he promised to compel them; and on 27th June, 1215, writs were\r\nactually issued instructing the seizure of the lands and goods of all\r\nwho would not swear to obey the twenty-five.[1077] (_b_) _Communa totius\r\nterre._ The “community of the whole land” was thus to afford active help\r\nin subjecting the king to the reign of law; and the phrase has been\r\npressed into the service of democracy by enthusiasts who seek to magnify\r\nmodern conceptions by finding their roots in the past. Few words of\r\nmedieval Latin offer a more tempting field to enquirers than this\r\n_communa_, which, with its English and French equivalents, holds the key\r\nto many problems of constitutional origins. A group of interesting\r\nquestions clusters round the three words “borough, guild, and commune,”\r\nand the appearance in Magna Carta of a body described as a “commune”\r\n(_communa totius terre_) in conjunction with an oath of obedience to a\r\nrevolutionary committee suggests an interesting comparison with the form\r\nof civic constitution known in that age as “the sworn commune.”[1078] A\r\nsecond field of enquiry, equally alluring, is suggested by the fact that\r\nthe lower chamber of the Mother of Parliaments, the English “House of\r\nCommons,” was originally composed of the representatives of the various\r\ncommunes or communities known as counties and boroughs respectively.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1077:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1078:\r\n\r\n  It was only fourteen years since London (in 1191), probably following\r\n  the lead of Rouen, had extorted its “sworn commune” from Prince John\r\n  as the price of its support (cf. _supra_, c. 13). It might be\r\n  dangerous, however, to push so tempting an analogy too far.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThese wider questions are here referred to merely as illustrations of\r\nthe difficulties that lurk in the word “commune,” and in the equally\r\nperplexing phrase “commune of the whole land.”[1079] The mere use of\r\nsuch a phrase cannot be accepted as a proof that the Charter rests on a\r\nbroad popular basis.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1079:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, pp. 137-8.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIII. _Criticism of the Scheme._ The faults of the scheme, whether viewed\r\nfrom the side of theory or of practice, are obvious. It was a violent\r\nand unnatural measure, full of immediate dangers, and calculated to\r\nexercise a baneful influence on constitutional development in the\r\nfuture. The fact that Magna Carta provided no better sanction for its\r\nown enforcement than the right of legalized rebellion has already been\r\ndiscussed as its cardinal defect.[1080] Instead of preventing the king\r\nfrom inflicting wrongs, it merely provided forcible measures for the\r\nredress of those already committed, thus adding the crowning evil of\r\ncivil war to those minor evils it sought to reform. That the whole\r\nscheme was foredoomed to failure constitutes perhaps its least\r\nconspicuous fault in the eyes of later history. It is instructive to\r\nnote a few of its other defects in detail.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1080:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, p. 150.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(1) The scheme challenged hostility by its want of moderation. It aimed\r\nat reducing the Crown at one blow from the plenitude of irresponsible\r\ntyranny to a position of degrading impotence. On every vexed political\r\nquestion of the day, John’s authority would have been superseded by that\r\nof twenty-five of the most hostile faction of the baronage. If the king\r\nthought himself aggrieved in anything, he would require to plead his\r\ncause humbly before a tribunal in which his opponents sat as judges. The\r\nscheme was thus repugnant to the mass of loyal Englishmen, who cherished\r\na respect for the time-honoured principle of monarchy. No king with a\r\ngrain of self-respect would long submit tamely to a position so\r\nillogical and degrading—to remain a sovereign whose “sovereignty”\r\nexisted merely on the sufferance of his enemies, a puppet-king whose\r\nsubjects had the legal right to coerce him. The powers thus conferred on\r\na baronial committee in 1215 were more sweeping than those conferred on\r\na similar committee in 1258, and yet the Parliament which appointed the\r\nlatter has been branded for all time as “the Mad Parliament,” because of\r\nthe violence of its measures against the king.\r\n\r\n(2) Rebellion, even where morally justified, is essentially and\r\nnecessarily illegal; to attempt to map out for it a legitimate sphere of\r\naction is to attempt the logically impossible. The barons, in their\r\ndearth of political experience, and in the extremity of their need, had\r\ndemanded and obtained something more dangerous than the amplest measure\r\nof constitutional authority. They had failed to rise to the true\r\nconception of a limited monarchy. Their scheme recognized a king still\r\nabsolute in some matters, but in others powerless and abject. They set\r\nup side by side two rival Executives, each in different circumstances\r\nsupreme. The relations of the two were far from accurately defined, even\r\nin theory, while collisions were certain to occur frequently in\r\npractice. The powers of the twenty-five, a body which received no proper\r\norganization, were those of aggression rather than of administration.\r\nViewed in this light, the claims of the barons to constructive\r\nstatesmanship rank extremely low.\r\n\r\n(3) The powers of the Revolutionary Committee, excessive though\r\nill-defined, backed by the sworn obedience of all classes of the nation,\r\nwould tend completely to paralyze the king. The nominal sovereign,\r\nalways nervous under this sword of Damocles, would lose all power of\r\ninitiative, while the committee, so powerful to reduce him to impotence,\r\nwould be powerless alike to goad him into action or to act in his stead.\r\nThe Revolutionary Committee had been planned as a drag on a bad\r\nexecutive, not as a good executive to take its place.\r\n\r\n(4) Even as a drag, however, the efficiency of the committee would have\r\nbeen completely neutralized in either of two contingencies: if the\r\nbarons composing it disagreed among themselves, or, if the king refused\r\nto surrender, preferring the appeal to arms. The monarch had always the\r\nalternative of civil war, and the material and moral advantage of acting\r\non the defensive lay with him; while the committee had to face the risks\r\nto which an attacking party is invariably exposed. Not a single step to\r\nrestrain the king could legally be taken until he had precipitated\r\nmatters by committing a clear act of aggression, and had thereafter\r\nreceived formal intimation followed by an interval of forty days, during\r\nwhich he might complete his preparation for war without fear of\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\n(5) If the scheme of the barons seems ill-suited to meet the needs of\r\nthe hour of its conception, it was fraught with even greater dangers to\r\nthe future development of the English constitution. The problem it\r\nsought to solve was one of no transient or unimportant nature, since it\r\nwas nothing less than the devising of legal machinery to prevent the\r\nking from abusing the powers entrusted to him. The barons sought the\r\nbest method of turning royal promises of reform into laws which\r\nsucceeding kings must obey. In attempting this, Magna Carta moved along\r\nlines which were radically wrong; which, if not departed from in time,\r\nwould have rendered any enduring progress impossible. The statesmanship\r\nwhich, while leaving one king on the throne, subjected him to the\r\ndictation of “five-and-twenty over-kings” in regard to all vital\r\nquestions of the day, was crude and ill-advised. It is true that the\r\nparty of reform throughout the long reign of Henry III. clung to the\r\nsame erroneous solution, although under various modifications on points\r\nof detail; but they met with no success. After half a century of unrest\r\na settlement seemed as far distant as before. If the same policy had\r\nbeen persisted in during Edward’s reign the English constitution, as it\r\nbecame known to after ages, would never have been evolved. The dangers\r\nand defects of schemes like those of 1215 and of 1258 are most clearly\r\nseen in contrast with the more tactful efforts of Edward I. towards a\r\ntrue solution, along lines leading in due time to complete success.\r\n\r\nThe true policy for the barons was to use the king’s own administrative\r\nmachinery and the king’s own servants to control the king himself. The\r\nprinciple was slowly established that the sovereign could perform no\r\nsingle act of prerogative except through the agency of the proper\r\nminister or group of ministers. Each function of government became\r\nassociated with a specific office or organ of the royal household. The\r\nrights of the official head of each department became stereotyped, and\r\nhis position obtained full legal acknowledgment, while very gradually\r\nthe doctrine of ministerial responsibility grew up, compelling each\r\nofficer of the Crown to obey not only the law of the land, but also the\r\n_Commune Concilium_, fast changing into the modern Parliament. The\r\nexpedients of an earlier age disappeared as no longer required, when the\r\nking’s good faith was secured by means of the friendly control of his\r\nown ministers, not by the violent compulsion of his opponents. The\r\ncredit of starting the constitution on its right line of development is\r\nin great measure due to Edward I.[1081]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1081:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, pp. 189-193 for a sketch of Edward’s policy.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIV. _Dr. Gneist’s Criticism._ Dangerous and even absurd as this scheme\r\nappears, it has found its apologist. Dr. Gneist accuses English\r\nhistorians of making “very inappropriate comparisons” between this\r\nbaronial committee and the continental expedients of the same period.\r\nWhile in most countries of Europe, each baron arrogated the right of\r\nprivate war against his sovereign in circumstances to be determined by\r\nhis own individual judgment, Magna Carta conferred rights of rebellion\r\nonly on the barons “in their collective capacity,” and “as represented\r\nby definite organs.”[1082] The substitution of collective repressive\r\nmeasures for the right of private feud undoubtedly marks an advance; but\r\nrebellion, even when organized, cannot be considered a satisfactory\r\nconstitutional expedient. Dr. Gneist is scarcely more convincing when he\r\nargues that English historians and jurists have condemned too\r\nunreservedly a scheme which is “so far in harmony with the spirit of the\r\nfeudal state of the Middle Ages as it was based upon a mutual relation\r\nof feudal protection and fealty, that is, upon compact.” “The concession\r\nby agreement,” he continues, “of the rights of distress was altogether\r\nso entirely consonant with the legal conceptions of the Middle Ages that\r\nin this way the committee of resistance loses a portion of its\r\napparently revolutionary character.”[1083] That the Middle Ages approved\r\nof revolution does not, however, change it into constitutional action;\r\nwhile the fact that it was founded upon the feudal conception of mutual\r\ncontract may explain it, but does not render it more worthy of\r\nadmiration. The whole scheme was, of course, thoroughly in accord with\r\nthe public opinion of the age, but that merely shows how wide is the\r\ngulf which separates medieval conceptions from modern ones, and how\r\nabsurd it is to regard the Great Charter, as is sometimes done, as\r\nanticipating the fundamental principles of the English constitution of\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1082:\r\n\r\n  Gneist, _English Const._, 251.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1083:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn spite of all apologies, the crudeness of the only sanction provided\r\nby Magna Carta for its own enforcement prevents it from ranking as a\r\ngreat monument of constructive statesmanship.\r\n\r\nV. _Failure of the Scheme._ Almost before John’s Magna Carta, in its\r\ncompleted form, had been engrossed and sealed, the futility of its\r\nsanction was recognized. Each side grew suspicious and demanded new\r\n“sanctions,” new guarantees not contained in the Charter.\r\n\r\n(1) _Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?_ Magna Carta, assuming apparently\r\nthat perfect trust could be placed in the rectitude and wisdom of the\r\nRevolutionary Committee, provided no machinery for controlling them, no\r\nguarantee that they would observe the Charter without misinterpreting\r\nits provisions to suit their own selfish interests. The futility of this\r\ncomplacency was soon manifest. One tyrant had brought distress on the\r\nwhole nation; and now he was to be superseded by five-and-twenty. Who\r\nwas to restrain the new tyrants? A second committee was nominated partly\r\nto assist and partly to control the twenty-five. Matthew Paris[1084]\r\ndescribes it as composed of thirty-eight “_Obsecutores et\r\nObservatores_,” including the Earl Marshal, Hubert de Burgh, the earls\r\nof Arundel and Warenne, and other prominent members of the moderate\r\nparty, not unfriendly to the king. Dr. Stubbs dismisses their relations\r\nto the executors with the remark that they “swore to obey the orders of\r\nthe twenty-five.”[1085] Miss Norgate takes what seems to be a better\r\nview, in emphasizing as the chief reason for their appointment the duty\r\nof compelling “both the king and the twenty-five to deal justly with one\r\nanother.”[1086] The thirty-eight were required to constrain the\r\ntwenty-five, as the twenty-five constrained the king.[1087]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1084:\r\n\r\n  _Chron. Maj._, II. 605-6.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1085:\r\n\r\n  _Const. Hist._, I. 583, n.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1086:\r\n\r\n  _John Lackland_, 236.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1087:\r\n\r\n  One version of the narrative of Matthew Paris is much fuller than the\r\n  other. The first MS. merely says, “_Isti omnes juraverunt quod\r\n  obsequerentur mandato viginti quinque baronum._” The second gives the\r\n  important addition, “_Omnes isti juraverunt cogere si opus esset\r\n  ipsos_ xxv. _barones ut rectificarent regem_. _Et etiam cogere ipsum\r\n  si mutato animo forte recalcitraret_,” II. 606, n.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(2) _Suspicions of the barons’ good faith._ Whether the appointment of\r\nthe committee of thirty-eight was due partly to John’s influence or was\r\nentirely the result of mutual jealousies in the ranks of those opposed\r\nto him, there is absolute evidence that the king was distrustful of the\r\nbarons’ good faith, and desired on his part some “sanction” that they\r\nwould not again renounce that allegiance, the renewal of which was the\r\n_quid pro quo_ for which he had granted the Charter. Apparently the\r\nleading barons did renew their oath of fealty and homage on 19th June at\r\nRunnymede; but refused to grant a formal Charter to that effect,\r\nalthough they had promised to give any security John might require,\r\nexcept hostages or castles. The prelates when appealed to sided with the\r\nking; they executed a formal declaration or protest, recording the\r\nbarons’ promise and subsequent refusal to give effect to it. There is no\r\nreason to doubt the testimony of the prelates; they had been present at\r\nall the negotiations, and it was by their mediation that the terms of\r\npeace embodied in Magna Carta had been settled. This was not the only\r\nmatter on which the bishops found it necessary to intervene on the\r\nking’s behalf. The new baronial executive and the twelve knights who\r\nacted as their agents in each county, pushed to unfair lengths the\r\nauthority to reform abuses conferred on them in terms of Magna Carta. In\r\nparticular, they proceeded virtually to abolish the royal forests\r\naltogether by abrogating as evil customs the procedure on which this\r\nbranch of the Crown’s prerogative rested. The prelates placed on record\r\na formal protest on this head also.[1088]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1088:\r\n\r\n  The texts of both Protests are given in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(3) _Suspicions of John’s good faith._ If neither the king nor the\r\nnation at large considered that the Great Charter contained sufficient\r\nsafeguards of their interests against the Committee of Executors, the\r\nbarons themselves soon came to the conclusion that the Committee, in\r\nspite of all its powers, formed an inadequate sanction against John.\r\nAccordingly they demanded further “security.” The city of London was\r\nplaced in their hands, and the Tower of London in the neutral custody of\r\nthe primate, as pledges of John’s good faith, until 15th August or\r\nlonger if need were. Those terms were reduced to writing in a document\r\nentitled “_Conventio facta inter Regem Anglie et barones ejusdem\r\nregni_,” which thus supplied a new sanction, or “form of security,”\r\nsupplementing, if not superseding, that contained in chapter 61 of Magna\r\nCarta.[1089]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1089:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, 51–2. The text is given in Appendix. Thirteen of the\r\n  twenty-five executors are mentioned by name as agreeing to this new\r\n  treaty on behalf of themselves and other earls, barons and freeholders\r\n  unnamed. Cf. R. Wendover, III. 319 (“_et turrem Londonarum_”). A third\r\n  sanction, or form of security, appears in the garbled versions of the\r\n  Charter given by R. Wendover (III. 317) and M. Paris (II. 603): the\r\n  constables of the four royal castles of Northampton, Kenilworth,\r\n  Nottingham and Scarborough, were to swear to hold these strongholds\r\n  under orders of the twenty-five executors. See M. Paris (_Ibid._).\r\n  This clause has not been found in any known copy of any issue of Magna\r\n  Carta. Cf. Mr. H. R. Luard’s _preface_ to the second volume of Matthew\r\n  Paris, pp. xxxiii. to xxxvi., where he discusses the peculiarities of\r\n  the versions given by Wendover and Paris.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(4) _Precautions against papal intervention._ The Articles of the barons\r\nafford undoubted evidence of its framers’ suspicions that John would\r\napply to Rome for absolution from his bargain. They showed considerable\r\nshrewdness in demanding that the English prelates and the papal legate\r\nshould become the king’s sureties that he would not procure from the\r\nPope anything to invalidate the Charter or diminish its efficacy. If\r\nPandulf, as the Pope’s accredited agent, had actually put his seal to\r\nsuch a document, he would have seriously embarrassed his august master\r\nin supporting John in a course of repudiation.\r\n\r\nTwo important alterations in the completed Charter were effected,\r\nhowever, whether at John’s instance, or at that of Pandulf, or of the\r\nEnglish prelates, is matter of conjecture. No mention was made of\r\nInnocent by name, the clause being made quite general in its terms. John\r\nmerely promised to procure a dispensation “from no one,” while the\r\nquestion of sureties was quietly ignored. The reason for the omission\r\nreadily suggests itself; Pandulf would naturally object to commit his\r\nprincipal or himself to any pledge of the kind. The Pope preserved\r\nperfect freedom, and the use which he made of this is matter of common\r\nknowledge.[1090]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1090:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, p. 55.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER SIXTY-TWO.\r\n\r\nEt omnes malas voluntates, indignaciones, et rancores ortos inter nos et\r\nhomines nostros, clericos et laicos, a tempore discordie, plene omnibus\r\nremisimus et condonavimus.

Et insuper fecimus eis\r\nfieri litteras testimoniales patentes domini Stephani Cantuariensis\r\narchiepiscopi, domini Henrici Dublinensis archiepiscopi, et episcoporum\r\npredictorum, et magistri Pandulfi, super securitate ista et\r\nconcessionibus prefatis.\r\n\r\n  And all the ill-will, hatreds, and bitterness that have arisen between\r\n  us and our men, clergy and lay, from the date of the quarrel, we have\r\n  completely remitted and pardoned to everyone. Moreover, all trespasses\r\n  occasioned by the said quarrel, from Easter in the sixteenth year of\r\n  our reign till the restoration of peace, we have fully remitted to\r\n  all, both clergy and laymen, and completely forgiven, as far as\r\n  pertains to us. And, on this head, we have caused to be made out to\r\n  them letters patent of Stephen, archbishop of Canterbury, Henry,\r\n  archbishop of Dublin, the bishops aforesaid, and master Pandulf, as\r\n  evidences of this clause of security and of the foresaid concessions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe clauses which follow the _forma securitatis_ are entirely of a\r\nformal nature, adding nothing to the substance of Magna Carta. The\r\npresent chapter, after making a well-meant declaration that bygones\r\nshould be bygones, and that perfect peace and goodwill should everywhere\r\nprevail—a pious aspiration doomed to speedy disillusion—proceeds to\r\nauthorize the prelates to issue under their seals certified copies of\r\nthe terms of the Great Charter. Such letters were actually issued, and\r\ntheir terms are preserved in the Red Book of the Exchequer.[1091]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1091:\r\n\r\n  See _folio_ 234. The text which is reproduced by Bémont, _Chartres_,\r\n  p. 35, runs as follows: \"Omnibus Christi fidelibus ad quos presens\r\n  scriptum pervenerit, Stephanus Dei gratia Cantuariensis\r\n  archiepiscopus, tocius Anglie primas et sancte romane ecclesie\r\n  cardinalis, Henricus, eadem gratia Dublinensis archiepiscopus,\r\n  Willelmus Londoniensis, Petrus Wintoniensis, Joscelinus, Bathoniensis\r\n  et Glastoniensis, Hugo Lincolniensis, Walterus Wigorniensis, Willelmus\r\n  Coventriensis et Benedictus Roffensis, divina miseracione episcopi, et\r\n  magister Pandulfus domini pape subdiaconus et familiaris, salutem in\r\n  Domino. Sciatis nos inspexisse cartam quam dominus noster Johannes\r\n  illustris rex Anglie fecit comitibus, baronibus et liberis hominibus\r\n  suis Anglie de libertate sancte ecclesie et libertatibus et liberis\r\n  consuetudinibus suis eisdem ab eo concessis sub hac forma....\r\n\r\n       . . . . [Here follows the text of John’s Magna Carta]. . . .\r\n\r\n  Et ne huic forme predicte aliquid possit addi vel ab eadem aliquid\r\n  possit subtrahi vel minui, huic scripto sigilla nostra apposuimus.\"\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER SIXTY-THREE.\r\n\r\nQuare volumus et firmiter precipimus quod Anglicana ecclesia libera sit\r\net quod homines in regno nostro habeant et teneant omnes prefatas\r\nlibertates, jura, et concessiones, bene et in pace, libere et quiete,\r\nplene et integre sibi et heredibus suis, de nobis et heredibus nostris,\r\nin omnibus rebus et locis, in perpetuum, sicut predictum est. Juratum\r\nest autem tam ex parte nostra quam ex parte baronum, quod hec omnia\r\nsupradicta bona fide et sine malo ingenio observabuntur. Testibus\r\nsupradictis et multis aliis. Data per manum nostram in prato quod\r\nvocatur Ronimede, inter Windlesoram et Stanes, quinto decimo die Junii,\r\nanno regni nostri decimo septimo.\r\n\r\n  Wherefore it is our will, and we firmly enjoin, that the English\r\n  Church be free, and that the men in our kingdom have and hold all the\r\n  aforesaid liberties, rights, and concessions, well and peaceably,\r\n  freely and quietly, fully and wholly, for themselves and their heirs,\r\n  of us and our heirs, in all respects and in all places for ever, as is\r\n  aforesaid. An oath, moreover, has been taken, as well on our part as\r\n  on the part of the barons, that all these conditions aforesaid shall\r\n  be kept in good faith and without evil intent. Given under our\r\n  hand—the above-named and many others being witnesses—in the meadow\r\n  which is called Runnymede, between Windsor and Staines, on the\r\n  fifteenth day of June, in the seventeenth year of our reign.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis last of the sixty-three chapters into which Magna Carta has been\r\ndivided for purposes of convenience, not by its framers, but by modern\r\ncommentators, contains little that calls for special comment. Beginning\r\nwith a repetition of the declarations already made in chapter one that\r\nthe English church should be free (omitting, however, any second\r\nreference to canonical election) and that _homines in regno nostro_\r\nshould have and hold all of the aforesaid liberties, rights and\r\nconcessions, it went on to record the fact that both parties had taken\r\noath to observe its contents in good faith.[1092] The magnates named in\r\nthe preamble were thereafter, along with many others who were not named,\r\nreferred to collectively as witnesses. The Charter concludes with the\r\ndeclaration that it has been “given by our hand,” the place and date\r\nbeing specified, so as to conform to the formalities required in legal\r\ndocuments. The actual giving by John’s hand was effected by the impress\r\nof his great seal.[1093]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1092:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _supra_, 125.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1093:\r\n\r\n  There are no signatures to the document. The frequent references to\r\n  “the signing of the Great Charter” (_e.g._ Medley, _Const. Hist._,\r\n  127) are thus inaccurate, if “signing” is taken in its modern sense of\r\n  “subscribing,” but may perhaps be justified by a reference to _signum_\r\n  in its original meaning of “a seal.” To imprint a seal was, in a\r\n  sense, “to sign.” That Magna Carta, in spite of its mention of its own\r\n  date as 15th June, was actually sealed on the 19th has already been\r\n  asserted, _supra_, 48–49. To the proofs there adduced should be added\r\n  the testimony of the _Annals of Dunstable_, III. 43, which report that\r\n  peace was made between king and barons at Runnymede “_die Gervasii et\r\n  Protasii_.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX.\r\n                 DOCUMENTS RELATIVE TO, OR ILLUSTRATIVE\r\n                         OF JOHN’S MAGNA CARTA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             I.

Henricus, filius Willelmi regis, post\r\nobitum fratris sui Willelmi Dei gratia rex Anglorum, omnibus fidelibus\r\nsalutem.\r\n\r\n1. Sciatis me Dei misericordia et communi consilio baronum totius regni\r\nAnglie, ejusdem regem coronatum esse. Et, quia regnum oppressum erat\r\ninjustis exactionibus, ego, Dei respectu et amore quem erga vos habeo,\r\nsanctam Dei ecclesiam inprimis liberam facio, ita quod nec vendam, nec\r\nad firmam ponam, nec mortuo archiepiscopo, sive episcopo, sive abbate,\r\naliquid accipiam de dominico ecclesie vel de hominibus ejus, donec\r\nsuccessor in eam ingrediatur. Et omnes malas consuetudines, quibus\r\nregnum Anglie injuste opprimebatur, inde aufero; quas malas\r\nconsuetudines ex parte hic pono:\r\n\r\n2. Si quis baronum, comitum meorum, sive aliorum qui de me tenent,\r\nmortuus fuerit, heres suus non redimet terram suam sicut faciebat\r\ntempore fratris mei, sed justa et legitima relevatione relevabit eam.\r\nSimiliter et homines baronum meorum justa et legitima relevatione\r\nrelevabunt terras suas de dominis suis.\r\n\r\n3. Et si quis baronum vel aliorum hominum meorum filiam suam nuptum\r\ntradere voluerit, sive sororem, sive neptim, sive cognatam, mecum inde\r\nloquatur; sed neque ego aliquid de suo pro hac licentia accipiam, neque\r\ndefendam ei quin eam det, excepto si eam vellet jungere inimico meo. Et\r\nsi, mortuo barone sive alio homine meo, filia heres remanserit, illam\r\ndabo consilio baronum meorum cum terra sua. Et si, mortuo viro, uxor\r\nejus remanserit et sine liberis fuerit, dotem suam et maritationem\r\nhabebit; et eam non dabo marito, nisi secundum velle suum.\r\n\r\n4. Si vero uxor cum liberis remanserit, dotem quidem et maritationem\r\nhabebit dum corpus suum legitime servaverit, et eam non dabo, nisi\r\nsecundum velle suum; et terre et liberorum custos erit sive uxor, sive\r\nalius propinquarius qui justius esse debeat. Et precipio quod barones\r\nmei similiter se contineant erga filios vel filias et uxores hominum\r\nsuorum.\r\n\r\n5. Monetagium commune, quod capiebatur per civitates et comitatus, quod\r\nnon fuit tempore regis Edwardi, hoc ne amodo sit omnino defendo. Si quis\r\ncaptus fuerit, sive monetarius, sive alius, cum falsa moneta, justicia\r\nrecta inde fiat.\r\n\r\n6. Omnia placita et omnia debita que fratri meo debebantur condono,\r\nexceptis rectis firmis meis, et exceptis illis que pacta erant pro\r\naliorum hereditatibus, vel pro eis rebus que justius aliis contingebant.\r\nEt si quis pro hereditate sua aliquid pepigerat, illud condono, et omnes\r\nrelevationes que pro rectis hereditatibus pacte fuerant.\r\n\r\n7. Et si quis baronum vel hominum meorum infirmabitur, sicut ipse dabit\r\nvel dare disponet pecuniam suam, ita datam esse concedo; quod si ipse,\r\npreventus armis vel infirmitate, pecuniam suam non dederit val dare\r\ndisposuerit, uxor sua, sive liberi, aut parentes, et legitimi homines\r\nejus, eam pro anima ejus dividant, sicut eis melius visum fuerit.\r\n\r\n8. Si quis baronum vel hominum meorum forisfecerit, non dabit vadium in\r\nmisericordia pecunie, sicut faciebat tempore patris mei vel fratris mei;\r\nsed, secundum modum forisfacti, ita emendabit sicut emendasset retro a\r\ntempore patris mei, in tempore aliorum antecessorum meorum. Quod si\r\nperfidie vel sceleris convictus fuerit, sicut justum fuerit sic emendet.\r\n\r\n9. Murdra etiam, retro ab illa die qua in regem coronatus fui, omnia\r\ncondono; et ea que amodo facta fuerint, juste emendentur secundum lagam\r\nregis Edwardi.\r\n\r\n10. Forestas, omni consensu baronum meorum, in manu mea retinui sicut\r\npater meus eas habuit.\r\n\r\n11. Militibus qui per loricas terras suas defendunt, terras dominicarum\r\ncarrucarum suarum quietas ab omnibus gildis et omni opere proprio dono\r\nmeo concedo, ut, sicut tam magno allevamine alleviati sunt, ita se equis\r\net armis bene instruant ad servitium meum et ad defensionem regni mei.\r\n\r\n12. Pacem firmam in toto regno meo pono et teneri amodo precipio.\r\n\r\n13. Lagam Edwardi regis vobis reddo cum illis emendationibus quibus\r\npater meus eam emendavit consilio baronum suorum.\r\n\r\n14. Si quis aliquid de rebus meis vel de rebus alicujus post obitum\r\nWillelmi regis fratris mei cepit, totum cito sine emendatione reddatur;\r\net si quis inde aliquid retinuerit, ille super quem inventum fuerit\r\nmichi graviter emendabit.\r\n\r\nTestibus Mauricio Lundonie episcopo, et Gundulfo episcopo, et Willelmo\r\nelecto episcopo, et Henrico comite, et Simone comite, et Waltero\r\nGiffardo, et Rodberto de Monfort, et Rogero Bigoto, et Henrico de Portu,\r\napud Londoniam, quando fui coronatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           II.

Two of these variants have been here adopted (a)\r\n  “_regem Anglie_” for “_regem Anglorum_” and (b) “_postmodum_” added\r\n  after “_pontifice_.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nEgo Stephanus Dei gratia, assensu cleri et populi in regem Anglie\r\nelectus, et a Willelmo Cantuariensi archiepiscopo et sancte Romane\r\necclesie legato consecratus, et ab Innocentio sancte romane sedis\r\npontifice postmodum confirmatus, respectu et amore Dei sanctam ecclesiam\r\nliberam esse concedo, et debitam reverentiam illi confirmo.

Si vero morte preoccupatus fuerit, pro salute anime\r\nejus, ecclesie consilio, eadem fiat distributio. Dum vero sedes propriis\r\npastoribus vacue fuerint, ipsas et earum possessiones omnes in manu et\r\ncustodia clericorum vel proborum hominum ejusdem ecclesie committam,\r\ndonec pastor canonice substituatur.\r\n\r\nOmnes exactiones et injusticias et mescheningas sive per vicecomites vel\r\nper alios quoslibet male inductas funditus exstirpo.

The text is founded upon that\r\n  published by Mr. J. H. Round in the _English Historical Review_, VIII.\r\n  288, but effect has been given to most of the emendations suggested by\r\n  Mr. Hubert Hall and Mr. G. W. Prothero. Cf. _Ibid._, IX. 117 and 326.\r\n  The copy in the French Archives follows, on the same parchment, a copy\r\n  of the Charter of Liberties of Henry I. from which it is separated by\r\n  the following words (indicating the nature of both documents, the one\r\n  that had gone before and the other that was to follow): “Hec est Carta\r\n  Regis Henrici per quam barones querunt libertates et hec consequentia\r\n  concedit Rex Johannes.” Then follow twelve clauses which are here\r\n  numbered for convenience of reference, although no numbers appear in\r\n  the copy.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n              (WHICH MAY, PERHAPS, BE IDENTIFIED WITH THE\r\n                     SCHEDULE OF 27TH APRIL, 1215).\r\n\r\n1. Concedit Rex Johannes quod non capiet hominem absque judicio, nec\r\naliquid accipiet pro justitia, nec injustitiam faciet.\r\n\r\n2. Et si contingat quod meus baro vel homo meus moriatur et haeres suus\r\nsit in aetate, terram suam debeo ei reddere per rectum releveium absque\r\nmagis capiendi.\r\n\r\n3. Et si ita sit quod haeres sit infra aetatem, debeo iiij^{or}\r\nmilitibus de legalioribus feodi terram bajulare in custodia, et illi cum\r\nmeo famulo debent mihi reddere exitus terrae sine venditione nemorum et\r\nsine redemptione hominum et sine destructione parci et vivarii; et tunc\r\nquando ille haeres erit in aetate terram ei reddam quietam.\r\n\r\n4. Si foemina sit haeres terrae, debeo eam maritare, consilio generis\r\nsui, ita non sit disparagiata. Et si una vice eam dedero, amplius eam\r\ndare non possum, sed se maritabit ad libitum suum, sed non inimicis\r\nmeis.\r\n\r\n5. Si contingat quod baro aut homo meus moriatur, concedo ut pecunia sua\r\ndividatur sicut ipse diviserit; et si praeoccupatus fuerit aut armis aut\r\ninfirmitate improvisa, uxor ejus, aut liberi, aut parentes et amici\r\npropinquiores pro ejus anima dividant.\r\n\r\n6. Et uxor ejus non abibit de hospitio infra XL. dies et donec dotem\r\nsuam decenter habuerit, et maritagium habebit.\r\n\r\n7. Adhuc hominibus meis concedo ne eant in exercitu extra Angliam nisi\r\nin Normanniam et in Britanniam et hoc decenter; quod si aliquis debet\r\ninde servitium decem militum, consilio baronum meorum alleviabitur.\r\n\r\n8. Et si scutagium evenerit in terra, una marca argenti capietur de\r\nfeodi militis; et si gravamen exercitus contigerit, amplius caperetur\r\nconsilio baronum regni.\r\n\r\n9. Adhuc concedo ut omnes forestas quas pater meus et frater meus et ego\r\nafforestaverimus, deafforesto.\r\n\r\n10. Adhuc concedo ut milites qui in antiquis forestis meis suum nemus\r\nhabent, habeant nemus amodo ad herbergagia sua et ad ardendum; et\r\nhabeant foresterium suum; et ego tantum modo unum qui servet pecudes\r\nmeas.\r\n\r\n11. Et si aliquis hominum meorum moriatur qui Judaeis debeat, debitum\r\nnon usurabit quamdiu haeres ejus sit infra aetatem.\r\n\r\n12.

Rex vel ballivus non saisiet terram aliquam pro debito dum catalla\r\ndebitoris sufficiunt; nec plegii debitoris distringantur, dum capitalis\r\ndebitor sufficit ad solutionem; si vero capitalis debitor defecerit in\r\nsolutione, si plegii voluerint, habeant terras debitoris, donec debitum\r\nillud persolvatur plene, nisi capitalis debitor monstrare poterit se\r\nesse inde quietum erga plegios.\r\n\r\n6. Rex non concedet alicui baroni quod capiat auxilium de liberis\r\nhominibus suis, nisi ad corpus suum redimendum, et ad faciendum\r\nprimogenitum filium suum militem, et ad primogenitam filiam suam semel\r\nmaritandam, et hoc faciet per rationabile auxilium.\r\n\r\n7. Ne aliquis majus servitium faciat de feodo militis quam inde debetur.\r\n\r\n8. Ut communia placita non sequantur curiam domini regis, sed\r\nassignentur in aliquo certo loco; et ut recognitiones capiantur in\r\neisdem comitatibus, in hunc modum: ut rex mittat duos justiciaros per\r\n.iiii^{or}. vices in anno, qui cum .iiii^{or}. militibus ejusdem\r\ncomitatus electis per comitatum, capiant assisas de nova dissaisina,\r\nmorte antecessoris, et ultima presentatione, nec aliquis ob hoc sit\r\nsummonitus nisi juratores et due partes.\r\n\r\n9. Ut liber homo amercietur pro parvo delicto secundum modum delicti,\r\net, pro magno delicto, secundum magnitudinem, delicti, salvo\r\ncontinemento suo; villanus etiam eodem modo amercietur, salvo waynagio\r\nsuo; et mercator eodem modo, salva marcandisa, per sacramentum proborum\r\nhominum de visneto.\r\n\r\n10. Ut clericus amercietur de laico feodo suo secundum modum aliorum\r\npredictorum, et non secundum beneficium ecclesiasticum.\r\n\r\n11. Ne aliqua villa amercietur pro pontibus faciendis ad riparias, nisi\r\nubi de jure antiquitus esse solebant.\r\n\r\n12. Ut mensura vini, bladi, et latitudines pannorum et rerum aliarum,\r\nemendetur; et ita de ponderibus.\r\n\r\n13. Ut assise de nova dissaisina et de morte antecessoris abbrevientur;\r\net similiter de aliis assisis.\r\n\r\n14. Ut nullus vicecomes intromittat se de placitis ad coronam\r\npertinentibus sine coronatoribus; et ut comitatus et hundredi sint ad\r\nantiquas firmas absque nullo incremento, exceptis dominicis maneriis\r\nregis.\r\n\r\n15. Si aliquis tenens de rege moriatur, licebit vicecomiti vel alii\r\nballivo regis seisire et imbreviare catallum ipsius per visum legalium\r\nhominum, ita tamen quod nichil inde amoveatur, donec plenius sciatur si\r\ndebeat aliquod liquidum debitum domino regi, et tunc debitum regis\r\npersolvatur; residuum vero relinquatur executoribus ad faciendum\r\ntestamentum defuncti; et si nichil regi debetur, omnia catalla cedant\r\ndefuncto.\r\n\r\n16. Si aliquis liber homo intestatus decesserit, bona sua per manum\r\nproximorum parentum suorum et amicorum et per visum ecclesie\r\ndistribuantur.\r\n\r\n17. Ne vidue distringantur ad se maritandum, dum voluerint sine marito\r\nvivere, ita tamen quod securitatem facient quod non maritabunt se sine\r\nassensu regis, si de rege teneant, vel dominorum suorum de quibus\r\ntenent.\r\n\r\n18. Ne constabularius vel alius ballivus capiat blada vel alia catalla,\r\nnisi statim denarios inde reddat, nisi respectum habere possit de\r\nvoluntate venditoris.\r\n\r\n19. Ne constabularius possit distringere aliquem militem ad dandum\r\ndenarios pro custodia castri, si voluerit facere custodiam illam in\r\npropria persona vel per alium probum hominem, si ipse eam facere non\r\npossit per rationabilem causam; et si rex eum duxerit in exercitum, sit\r\nquietus de custodia secundum quantitatem temporis.\r\n\r\n20. Ne vicecomes, vel ballivus regis, vel aliquis alius, capiat equos\r\nvel carettas alicujus liberi hominis pro cariagio faciendo, nisi ex\r\nvoluntate ipsius.\r\n\r\n21. Ne rex vel ballivus suus capiat alienum boscum ad castra vel ad alia\r\nagenda sua, nisi per voluntatem ipsius cujus boscus ille fuerit.\r\n\r\n22. Ne rex teneat terram eorum qui fuerint convicti de felonia, nisi per\r\nunum annum et unum diem, sed tunc reddatur domino feodi.\r\n\r\n23. Ut omnes kidelli de cetero penitus deponantur de Tamisia et Medeweye\r\net per totam Angliam.\r\n\r\n24. Ne breve quod vocatur “Precipe” de cetero fiat alicui de aliquo\r\ntenemento unde liber homo amittat curiam suam.\r\n\r\n25. Si quis fuerit disseisitus vel prolongatus per regem sine juditio de\r\nterris, libertatibus, et jure suo, statim ei restituatur; et si\r\ncontentio super hoc orta fuerit, tunc inde disponatur per juditium .xxv.\r\nbaronum, et ut illi qui fuerint dissaisiti per patrem vel fratrem regis,\r\nrectum habeant sine dilatione per juditium parium suorum in curia regis;\r\net si rex debeat habere terminum aliorum cruce signatorum, tunc\r\narchiepiscopus et episcopi faciant inde juditium ad certum diem,\r\nappellatione remota.\r\n\r\n26. Ne aliquid detur pro brevi inquisitionis de vita vel membris, sed\r\nlibere concedatur sine pretio et non negetur.\r\n\r\n27. Si aliquis tenet de rege per feodi firmam, per sokagium, vel per\r\nburgagium, et de alio per servitium militis, dominus rex non habebit\r\ncustodiam militum de feodo alterius, occasione burgagii vel sokagii, nec\r\ndebet habere custodiam burgagii, sokagii, vel feodi firme; et quod liber\r\nhomo non amittat militiam suam occasione parvarum sergantisarum, sicuti\r\nde illis qui tenent aliquod tenementum reddendo inde cuttellos vel\r\nsagittas vel hujusmodi.\r\n\r\n28. Ne aliquis ballivus possit ponere aliquem ad legem simplici loquela\r\nsua sine testibus fidelibus.\r\n\r\n29. Ne corpus liberi hominis capiatur, nec imprisonetur, nec\r\ndissaisietur, nec utlagetur, nec exuletur, nec aliquo modo destruatur,\r\nnec rex eat vel mittat super eum vi, nisi per juditium parium suorum vel\r\nper legem terre.\r\n\r\n30. Ne jus vendatur vel differratur vel vetitum sit.\r\n\r\n31. Quod mercatores habeant salvum ire et venire ad emendum vel\r\nvendendum, sine omnibus malis toltis, per antiquas et rectas\r\nconsuetudines.\r\n\r\n32. Ne scutagium vel auxilium ponatur in regno, nisi per commune\r\nconsilium regni, nisi ad corpus regis redimendum, et primogenitum filium\r\nsuum militem faciendum, et filiam suam primogenitam semel maritandam; et\r\nad hoc fiat rationabile auxilium. Simili modo fiat de taillagiis et\r\nauxiliis de civitate Londonie, et de aliis civitatibus que inde habent\r\nlibertates, et ut civitas Londonie plene habeat antiquas libertates et\r\nliberas consuetudines suas, tam per aquas, quam per terras.\r\n\r\n33. Ut liceat unicuique exire de regno et redire, salva fide domini\r\nregis, nisi tempore werre per aliquod breve tempus propter communem\r\nutilitatem regni.\r\n\r\n34. Si quis mutuo aliquid acceperit a Judeis plus vel minus, et moriatur\r\nantequam debitum illud solvatur, debitum non usurabit quamdiu heres\r\nfuerit infra etatem, de quocumque teneat; et si debitum illud inciderit\r\nin manum regis, rex non capiet nisi catallum quod continetur in carta.\r\n\r\n35. Si quis moriatur et debitum debeat Judeis, uxor ejus habeat dotem\r\nsuam; et si liberi remanserint, provideantur eis necessaria secundum\r\ntenementum; et de residuo solvatur debitum salvo servitio dominorum;\r\nsimili modo fiat de aliis debitis; et ut custos terre reddat heredi, cum\r\nad plenam etatem pervenerit, terram suam instauratam secundum quod\r\nrationabiliter poterit sustinere de exitibus terre ejusdem de carucis et\r\nwainnagiis.\r\n\r\n36. Si quis tenuerit de aliqua eskaeta, sicut de honore Walingeford,\r\nNotingeham, Bononie, et Lankastrie, et de aliis eskaetis que sunt in\r\nmanu regis et sunt baronie, et obierit, heres ejus non dabit aliud\r\nrelevium, vel faciet regi aliud servitium quam faceret baroni; et ut rex\r\neodem modo eam teneat quo baro eam tenuit.\r\n\r\n37. Ut fines qui facti sunt pro dotibus, maritagiis, hereditatibus, et\r\namerciamentis, injuste et contra legem terre, omnino condonentur; vel\r\nfiat inde per juditium, .xxv. baronum, vel per juditium majoris partis\r\neorumdem, una cum archiepiscopo et aliis quos secum vocare voluerit ita\r\nquod, si aliquis vel aliqui de .xxv. fuerint in simili querela,\r\namoveantur et alii loco illorum per residuos de .xxv. substituantur.\r\n\r\n38. Quod obsides et carte reddantur, quae liberate fuerunt regi in\r\nsecuritatem.\r\n\r\n39. Ut illi qui fuerint extra forestam non veniant coram justiciariis de\r\nforesta per communes summonitiones, nisi sint in placito vel plegii\r\nfuerint; et ut prave consuetudines de forestis et de forestariis, et\r\nwarenniis, et vicecomitibus, et rivariis, emendentur per .xii. milites\r\nde quolibet comitatu, qui debent eligi per probos homines ejusdem\r\ncomitatus.\r\n\r\n40. Ut rex amoveat penitus de balliva parentes et totam sequelam Gerardi\r\nde Atyes, quod de cetero balliam non habeant, scilicet Engelardum,\r\nAndream, Petrum, et Gyonem de Cancellis, Gyonem de Cygony, Matheum de\r\nMartiny, et fratres ejus; et Galfridum nepotem ejus et Philippum Mark.\r\n\r\n41. Et ut rex amoveat alienigenas, milites, stipendiarios, balistarios,\r\net ruttarios, et servientes qui veniunt cum equis et armis ad nocumentum\r\nregni.\r\n\r\n42. Ut rex faciat justiciarios, constabularios, vicecomites, et\r\nballivos, de talibus qui sciant legem terre et eam bene velint\r\nobservare.\r\n\r\n43. Ut barones qui fundaverunt abbatias, unde habent cartas regum vel\r\nantiquam tenuram, habeant custodiam earum cum vacaverint.\r\n\r\n44. Si rex Walenses dissaisierit vel elongaverit de terris vel\r\nlibertatibus, vel de rebus aliis in Anglia vel in Wallia, eis statim\r\nsine placito reddantur; et si fuerint dissaisiti vel elongati de\r\ntenementis suis Anglie per patrem vel fratrem regis sine juditio parium\r\nsuorum, rex eis sine dilatione justiciam exhibebit, eo modo quo exhibet\r\nAnglicis justiciam de tenementis suis Anglie secundum legem Anglie, et\r\nde tenementis Wallie secundum legem Wallie, et de tenementis Marchie\r\nsecundum legem Marchie; idem facient Walenses regi et suis.\r\n\r\n 45. Ut rex reddat filium Lewelini et       } nisi aliter esse\r\n preterea omnes obsides de Wallia, et       } debeat per cartas\r\n cartas que ei liberate fuerunt in          } quas rex habet\r\n securitatem pacis . . .                    } per juditium\r\n 46. Ut rex faciat regi Scottorum de        } archiepiscopi et\r\n obsidibus reddendis, et de libertatibus    } aliorum quos\r\n suis, et jure suo, secundum formam         } secum vocare\r\n quam facit baronibus Anglie  .  .  .  .    } voluerit.\r\n\r\n47. Et omnes foreste que sunt aforestate per regem tempore suo\r\ndeafforestentur, et ita fiat de ripariis que per ipsum regem sunt in\r\ndefenso.\r\n\r\n48. Omnes autem istas consuetudines et libertates quas rex concessit\r\nregno tenendas quantum ad se pertinet erga suos, omnes de regno tam\r\nclerici quam laici observabunt quantum ad se pertinet erga suos.\r\n\r\n          [Here, there occurs a blank space in the original.]\r\n\r\n49. Hec est forma securitatis ad observandum pacem et libertates inter\r\nregem et regnum. Barones eligent .xxv. barones de regno quos voluerint,\r\nqui debent pro totis viribus suis observare, tenere et facere observari,\r\npacem et libertates quas dominus rex eis concessit et carta sua\r\nconfirmavit; ita videlicet quod si rex, vel justiciarius, vel ballivi\r\nregis, vel aliquis de ministris suis, in aliquo erga aliquem deliquerit,\r\nvel aliquem articulorum pacis aut securitatis transgressus fuerit, et\r\ndelictum ostensum fuerit .iiii^{or}. baronibus de praedictis .xxv.\r\nbaronibus, illi .iiii^{or}. barones accedent ad dominum regem, vel ad\r\njusticiarium suum, si rex fuerit extra regnum; proponentes ei excessum,\r\npetent ut excessum illum sine dilatione faciat emendari; et si rex vel\r\njusticiarius ejus illud non emendaverit, si rex fuerit extra regnum,\r\ninfra rationabile tempus determinandum in carta, predicti .iiii^{or}.\r\nreferent causam illam ad residuos de illis .xxv. baronibus, et illi\r\n.xxv. cum communa totius terre distringent et gravabunt regem modis\r\nomnibus quibus poterunt, scilicet per captionem castrorum, terrarum,\r\npossessionum, et aliis modis quibus poterunt, donec fuerit emendatum\r\nsecundum arbitrium eorum, salva persona domini regis et regine et\r\nliberorum suorum; et cum fuerit emendatum, intendant domino regi sicut\r\nprius. Et quicumque voluerit de terra jurabit se ad predicta exequenda\r\npariturum mandatis predictorum .xxv. baronum, et gravaturum regem pro\r\nposse suo cum ipsis; et rex pubblice et libere dabit licentiam jurandi\r\ncuilibet qui jurare voluerit, et nulli umquam jurare prohibebit. Omnes\r\nautem illos de terra qui sponte sua et per se noluerint jurare .xxv.\r\nbaronibus de distringendo et gravando regem cum eis, rex faciet jurare\r\neosdem de mandato suo sicut predictum est. Item si aliquis de predictis\r\n.xxv. baronibus decesserit, vel a terra recesserit, vel aliquo modo alio\r\nimpeditus fuerit quominus ista predicta possint exequi, qui residui\r\nfuerint de .xxv. eligent alium loco ipsius pro arbitrio suo, qui simili\r\nmodo erit juratus quo et ceteri. In omnibus autem que istis .xxv.\r\nbaronibus committuntur exequenda, si forte ipsi .xxv. presentes fuerint\r\net inter se super re aliqua discordaverint, vel aliqui ex eis vocati\r\nnolint vel nequeant interesse, ratum habebitur et firmum quod major pars\r\nex eis providerit vel preceperit, ac si omnes .xxv. in hoc\r\nconsensissent; et predicti .xxv. jurabunt quod omnia antedicta fideliter\r\nobservabunt et pro toto posse suo facient observari. Preterea rex faciet\r\neos securos per cartas archiepiscopi et episcoporum et magistri\r\nPandulfi, quod nichil impetrabit a domino papa per quod aliqua istarum\r\nconventionum revocetur vel minuatur, et, si aliquid tale impetraverit,\r\nreputetur irritum et inane et numquam eo utatur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            VI.

THE GREAT CHARTER OF HENRY III.[1106]\r\n                 (SECOND REISSUE, 6TH NOVEMBER, 1217.)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1106:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, pp. 171-9. The text is taken from that of the _Statutes\r\n  of the Realm_, I. 17-19.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHenricus Dei gratia rex Anglie, dominus Hibernie, dux Normannie,\r\nAquitanie, et comes Andegavie, archiepiscopis, episcopis, abbatibus,\r\nprioribus, comitibus, baronibus, vicecomitibus, prepositis, ministris et\r\nomnibus ballivis et fidelibus suis presentem cartam inspecturis,\r\nsalutem. Sciatis quod intuitu Dei et pro salute anime nostre et animarum\r\nantecessorum et successorum nostrorum, ad exaltationem sancte ecclesie\r\net emendationem regni nostri, concessimus et hac presenti carta\r\nconfirmavimus pro nobis et heredibus nostris in perpetuum, de consilio\r\nvenerabilis patris nostri domini Gualonis tituli Sancti Martini\r\npresbiteri cardinalis et apostolice sedis legati, domini Walteri\r\nEboracensis archiepiscopi, Willelmi Londoniensis episcopi, et aliorum\r\nepiscoporum Anglie et Willelmi Mariscalli comitis Pembrocie, rectoris\r\nnostri et regni nostri, et aliorum fidelium comitum et baronum nostrorum\r\nAnglie, has libertates tenendas in regno nostro Anglie in perpetuum.\r\n\r\n1. In primis concessimus Deo et hac presenti carta nostra confirmavimus\r\npro nobis et heredibus nostris in perpetuum quod anglicana ecclesia\r\nlibera sit, et habeat jura sua integra et libertates suas illesas.\r\nConcessimus etiam omnibus liberis hominibus regni nostri pro nobis et\r\nheredibus nostris in perpetuum omnes libertates subscriptas, habendas et\r\ntenendas eis et heredibus suis de nobis et heredibus nostris.\r\n\r\n2. Si quis comitum vel baronum nostrorum sive aliorum tenencium de nobis\r\nin capite per servicium militare mortuus fuerit, et, cum decesserit,\r\nheres ejus plene etatis fuerit et relevium debeat, habeat hereditatem\r\nsuam per antiquum relevium, scilicet heres vel heredes comitis de\r\nbaronia comitis integra per centum libras, heres vel heredes baronis de\r\nbaronia integra per centum libras, heres vel heredes militis de feodo\r\nmilitis integro per centum solidos ad plus; et qui minus debuerit minus\r\ndet secundum antiquam consuetudinem feodorum.\r\n\r\n3. Si autem heres alicujus talium fuerit infra etatem, dominus ejus non\r\nhabeat custodiam ejus nec terre sue antequam homagium ejus ceperit; et,\r\npostquam talis heres fuerit in custodia, cum ad etatem pervenerit,\r\nscilicet viginti et unius anni, habeat hereditatem suam sine relevio et\r\nsine fine, ita tamen quod, si ipse, dum infra etatem fuerit, fiat miles,\r\nnichilominus terra remaneat in custodia dominorum suorum usque ad\r\nterminum predictum.\r\n\r\n4. Custos terre hujusmodi heredis qui infra etatem fuerit non capiat de\r\nterra heredis nisi rationabiles exitus et rationabiles consuetudines et\r\nrationabilia servicia, et hoc sine destructione et vasto hominum vel\r\nrerum; et si nos commiserimus custodiam alicujus talis terre vicecomiti\r\nvel alicui alii qui de exitibus terre illius nobis debeat respondere, et\r\nille destructionem de custodia fecerit vel vastum, nos ab illo capiemus\r\nemendam, et terra committatur duobus legalibus et discretis hominibus de\r\nfeodo illo qui de exitibus nobis respondeant vel ei cui eos\r\nassignaverimus; et si dederimus vel vendiderimus alicui custodiam\r\nalicujus talis terre, et ille destructionem inde fecerit vel vastum,\r\namittat ipsam custodiam et tradatur duobus legalibus et discretis\r\nhominibus de feodo illo qui similiter nobis respondeant, sicut predictum\r\nest.\r\n\r\n5. Custos autem, quamdiu custodiam terre habuerit, sustentet domos,\r\nparcos, vivaria, stagna, molendina et cetera ad terram illam pertinencia\r\nde exitibus terre ejusdem, et reddat heredi, cum ad plenam etatem\r\npervenerit, terram suam totam instauratam de carucis et omnibus aliis\r\nrebus, ad minus secundum quod illam recepit. Hec omnia observentur de\r\ncustodiis archiepiscopatuum, episcopatuum, abbatiarum, prioratuum,\r\necclesiarum et dignitatum vacancium que ad nos pertinent, excepto quod\r\nhujusmodi custodie vendi non debent.\r\n\r\n6. Heredes maritentur absque disparagatione.\r\n\r\n7. Vidua post mortem mariti sui statim et sine difficultate aliqua\r\nhabeat maritagium suum et hereditatem suam, nec aliquid det pro dote sua\r\nvel pro maritagio suo vel pro hereditate sua, quam hereditatem maritus\r\nsuus et ipsa tenuerint die obitus ipsius mariti, et maneat in capitali\r\nmesuagio mariti sui per quadraginta dies post obitum ipsius mariti sui,\r\ninfra quos assignetur ei dos sua, nisi prius ei fuerit assignata, vel\r\nnisi domus ilia sit castrum; et si de castro recesserit, statim\r\nprovideatur ei domus competens in qua possit honeste morari, quousque\r\ndos sua ei assignetur secundum quod predictum est, et habeat rationabile\r\nestoverium suum interim de communi. Assignetur autem ei pro dote sua\r\ntercia pars tocius terre mariti sui que sua fuit in vita sua, nisi de\r\nminori dotata fuerit ad hostium ecclesie.\r\n\r\n8. Nulla vidua distringatur ad se maritandam, dum vivere voluerit sine\r\nmarito, ita tamen quod securitatem faciet quod se non maritabit sine\r\nassensu nostro, si de nobis tenuerit, vel sine assensu domini sui, si de\r\nalio tenuerit.\r\n\r\n9. Nos vero vel ballivi nostri non seisiemus terram aliquam nee redditum\r\npro debito aliquo quamdiu catalla debitoris presencia sufficiunt ad\r\ndebitum reddendum et ipse debitor paratus sit inde satisfacere; nee\r\nplegii ipsius debitoris distringantur quamdiu ipse capitalis debitor\r\nsufficiat ad solutionem debiti; et, si capitalis debitor defecerit in\r\nsolutione debiti, non habens unde reddat aut reddere nolit cum possit,\r\nplegii respondeant pro debito; et, si voluerint, habeant terras et\r\nredditus debitoris quousque sit eis satisfactum de debito quod ante pro\r\neo solverint, nisi capitalis debitor monstraverit se inde esse quietum\r\nversus eosdem plegios.\r\n\r\n10. Civitas Londonie habeat omnes antiquas libertates et liberas\r\nconsuetudines suas. Preterea volumus et concedimus quod omnes alie\r\ncivitates, et burgi, et ville, et barones de quinque portubus, et omnes\r\nportus, habeant omnes libertates et liberas consuetudines suas.\r\n\r\n11. Nullus distringatur ad faciendum majus servicium de feodo militis\r\nnec de alio libero tenemento quam inde debetur.\r\n\r\n12. Communia placita non sequantur curiam nostram, set teneantur in\r\naliquo loco certo.\r\n\r\n13. Recognitiones de nova disseisina et de morte antecessoris non\r\ncapiantur nisi in suis comitatibus, et hoc modo: nos, vel si extra\r\nregnum fuerimus, capitalis justiciarius noster, mittemus justiciarios\r\nper unumquemque comitatum semel in anno, qui cum militibus comitatuum\r\ncapiant in comitatibus assisas predictas.\r\n\r\n14. Et ea que in illo adventu suo in comitatu per justiciarios predictos\r\nad dictas assisas capiendas missos terminari non possunt, per eosdem\r\nterminentur alibi in itinere suo; et ea que per eosdem propter\r\ndifficultatem aliquorum articulorum terminari non possunt, referantur ad\r\njusticiarios nostros de banco, et ibi terminentur.\r\n\r\n15. Assise de ultima presentatione semper capiantur coram justiciariis\r\nnostris de banco et ibi terminentur.\r\n\r\n16. Liber homo non amercietur pro parvo delicto nisi secundum modum\r\nipsius delicti, et pro magno delicto, secundum magnitudinem delicti,\r\nsalvo contenemento suo; et mercator eodem modo salva mercandisa sua; et\r\nvillanus alterius quam noster eodem modo amercietur salvo wainagio suo,\r\nsi incident in misericordiam nostram: et nulla predictarum\r\nmisericordiarum ponatur nisi per sacramenta proborum et legalium hominum\r\nde visneto.\r\n\r\n17. Comites et barones non amercientur nisi per pares suos, et non nisi\r\nsecundum modum delicti.\r\n\r\n18. Nulla ecclesiastica persona amercietur secundum quantitatem\r\nbeneficii sui ecclesiastici, sed secundum laicum tenementum suum, et\r\nsecundum quantitatem delicti.\r\n\r\n19. Nec villa, nec homo, distringatur facere pontes ad riparias nisi qui\r\nex antiquo et de jure facere debet.\r\n\r\n20. Nulla riparia decetero defendatur, nisi ille que fuerunt in defenso\r\ntempore regis Henrici avi nostri, per eadem loca et eosdem terminos\r\nsicut esse consueverunt tempore suo.\r\n\r\n21. Nullus vicecomes, constabularius, coronatores vel alii ballivi\r\nnostri teneant placita corone nostre.\r\n\r\n22. Si aliquis tenens de nobis laicum feodum moriatur, et vicecomes vel\r\nballivus noster ostendat litteras nostras patentes de summonitione\r\nnostra de debito quod defunctus nobis debuit, liceat vicecomiti vel\r\nballivo nostro attachiare et inbreviare catalla defuncti inventa in\r\nlaico feodo ad valenciam illius debiti per visum legalium hominum, ita\r\ntamen quod nichil inde amoveatur donec persolvatur nobis debitum quod\r\nclarum fuerit, et residuum relinquatur executoribus ad faciendum\r\ntestamentum defuncti; et si nichil nobis debeatur ab ipso, omnia catalla\r\ncedant defuncto, salvis uxori ipsius rationabilibus partibus suis.\r\n\r\n23. Nullus constabularius vel ejus ballivus capiat blada vel alia\r\ncatalla alicujus qui non sit de villa ubi castrum situm est, nisi statim\r\ninde reddat denarios aut respectum inde habere possit de voluntate\r\nvenditoris; si autem de villa ipsa fuerit, infra quadraginta dies\r\nprecium reddat.\r\n\r\n24. Nullus constabularius distringat aliquem militem ad dandum denarios\r\npro custodia castri, si ipse eam facere voluerit in propria persona sua,\r\nvel per alium probum hominem, si ipse eam facere non possit propter\r\nrationabilem causam, et, si nos duxerimus eum vel miserimus in\r\nexercitum, erit quietus de custodia secundum quantitatem temporis quo\r\nper nos fuerit in exercitu de feodo pro quo fecit servicium in exercitu.\r\n\r\n25. Nullus vicecomes, vel ballivus noster, vel alius capiat equos vel\r\ncarettas alicujus pro cariagio faciendo, nisi reddat liberationem\r\nantiquitus statutam, scilicet pro caretta ad duos equos decem denarios\r\nper diem, et pro caretta ad tres equos quatuordecim denarios per diem.\r\n\r\n26. Nulla caretta dominica alicujus ecclesiastice persone vel militis\r\nvel alicujus domine capiatur per ballivos predictos.\r\n\r\n27. Nec nos nec ballivi nostri nec alii capiemus alienum boscum ad\r\ncastra vel alia agenda nostra, nisi per voluntatem illius cujus boscus\r\nille fuerit.\r\n\r\n28. Nos non tenebimus terras eorum qui convicti fuerint de felonia, nisi\r\nper unum annum et unum diem; et tunc reddantur terre dominis feodorum.\r\n\r\n29. Omnes kidelli decetero deponantur penitus per Tamisiam et Medeweiam\r\net per totam Angliam, nisi per costeram maris.\r\n\r\n30. Breve quod vocatur Precipe decetero non fiat alicui de aliquo\r\ntenemento, unde liber homo perdat curiam suam.\r\n\r\n31. Una mensura vini sit per totum regnum nostrum, et una mensura\r\ncervisie, et una mensura bladi, scilicet quarterium Londonie, et una\r\nlatitudo pannorum tinctorum et russettorum et haubergettorum, scilicet\r\ndue ulne infra listas; de ponderibus vero sit ut de mensuris.\r\n\r\n32. Nichil detur de cetero pro brevi inquisitionis ab eo qui\r\ninquisitionem petit de vita vel membris, set gratis concedatur et non\r\nnegetur.\r\n\r\n33. Si aliquis teneat de nobis per feodifirmam vel soccagium, vel per\r\nburgagium, et de alio terram teneat per servicium militare, nos non\r\nhabebimus custodiam heredis nee terre sue que est de feodo alterius,\r\noccasione illius feodifirme, vel soccagii, vel burgagii, nec habebimus\r\ncustodiam illius feodifirme vel soccagii vel burgagii, nisi ipsa\r\nfeodifirma debeat servicium militare. N os non habebimus custodiam\r\nheredis vel terre alicujus quam tenet de alio per servicium militare,\r\noccasione alicujus parve serjanterie quam tenet de nobis per servicium\r\nreddendi nobis cultellos, vel sagittas, vel hujusmodi.\r\n\r\n34. Nullus ballivus ponat decetero aliquem ad legem manifestam vel ad\r\njuramentum simplici loquela sua, sine testibus fidelibus ad hoc\r\ninductis.\r\n\r\n35. Nullus liber homo decetero capiatur vel inprisonetur aut\r\ndisseisiatur de aliquo libero tenemento suo vel libertatibus vel liberis\r\nconsuetudinibus suis, aut utlagetur, aut exulet, aut aliquo alio modo\r\ndestruatur, nec super eum ibimus, nec super eum mittemus, nisi per\r\nlegale judicium parium suorum, vel per legem terre.\r\n\r\n36. Nulli vendemus, nulli negabimus aut differemus rectum vel justiciam.\r\n\r\n37. Omnes mercatores, nisi publice antea prohibiti fuerint, habeant\r\nsalvum et securum exire de Anglia, et venire in Angliam, et morari, et\r\nire per Angliam tarn per terram quam per aquam ad emendum vel vendendum\r\nsine omnibus toltis malis per antiquas et rectas consuetudines,\r\npreterquam in tempore gwerre, et si sint de terra contra nos gwerrina;\r\net si tales inveniantur in terra nostra in principio gwerre,\r\nattachientur sine dampno corporum vel rerum, donee sciatur a nobis vel a\r\ncapitali justiciario nostro quomodo mercatores terre nostre tractentur,\r\nqui tunc invenientur in terra contra nos gwerrina; et, si nostri salvi\r\nsint ibi, alii salvi sint in terra nostra.\r\n\r\n38. Si quis tenuerit de aliqua escaeta, sicut de honore Wallingefordie,\r\nBolonie, Notingeham, Lancastrie, vel de aliis que sunt in manu nostra,\r\net sint baronie, et obierit, heres ejus non det aliud relevium nec\r\nfaciat nobis aliud servicium quam faceret baroni, si ilia esset in manu\r\nbaronis; et nos eodem modo eam tenebimus quo baro eam tenuit; nec nos,\r\noccasione tabs baronie vel escaete, habebimus aliquam escaetam vel\r\ncustodiam aliquorum hominum nostrorum, nisi alibi tenuerit de nobis in\r\ncapite ille qui tenuit baroniam vel escaetam.\r\n\r\n39. Nullus liber homo decetero det amplius alicui vel vendat de terra\r\nsua quam ut de residuo terre sue possit sufficienter fieri domino feodi\r\nservicium ei debitum quod pertinet ad feodum illud.\r\n\r\n40. Omnes patroni abbatiarum qui habent cartas regum Anglie de\r\nadvocatione, vel antiquam tenuram vel possessionem, habeant earum\r\ncustodiam cum vacaverint, sicut habere debent, et sicut supra declaratum\r\nest.\r\n\r\n41. Nullus capiatur vel imprisonetur propter appellum femine de morte\r\nalterius quam viri sui.\r\n\r\n42. Nullus comitatus decetero teneatur, nisi de mense in mensem; et, ubi\r\nmajor terminus esse solebat, major sit. Nec aliquis vicecomes vel\r\nballivus faciat turnum suum per hundredum nisi bis in anno et non nisi\r\nin loco debito et consueto, videlicet semel post Pascha et iterum post\r\nfestum sancti Michaelis. Et visus de franco plegio tunc fiat ad ilium\r\nterminum sancti Michaelis sine occasione, ita scilicet quod quilibet\r\nhabeat libertates suas quas habuit et habere consuevit tempore regis\r\nHenrici avi nostri, vel quas postea perquisivit. Fiat autem visus de\r\nfranco plegio sic, videlicet quod pax nostra teneatur, et quod tethinga\r\nintegra sit sicut esse consuevit, et quod vicecomes non querat\r\noccasiones, et quod contentus sit eo quod vicecomes habere consuevit de\r\nvisu suo faciendo tempore regis Henrici avi nostri.\r\n\r\n43. Non liceat alicui decetero dare terram suam alicui domui religiose,\r\nita quod eam resumat tenendam de eadem domo, nec liceat alicui domui\r\nreligiose terram alicujus sic accipere quod tradat eam illi a quo ipsam\r\nreceperit tenendam. Si quis autem de cetero terram suam alicui domui\r\nreligiose sic dederit, et super hoc convincatur, donum suum penitus\r\ncassetur, et terra illa domino suo illius feodi incurratur.\r\n\r\n44. Scutagium decetero capiatur sicut capi consuevit tempore regis\r\nHenrici avi nostri.\r\n\r\n45. Omnes autem istas consuetudines predictas et libertates quas\r\nconcessimus in regno nostro tenendas quantum ad nos pertinet erga\r\nnostros, omnes de regno nostro tam clerici quam laici observent quantum\r\nad se pertinet erga suos.\r\n\r\n46. Salvis archiepiscopis, episcopis, abbatibus, prioribus, templariis,\r\nhospitalariis, comitibus, baronibus et omnibus aliis tam ecclesiasticis\r\npersonis quam secularibus, libertatibus et liberis consuetudinibus quas\r\nprius habuerunt.\r\n\r\n47. Statuimus etiam, de communi consilio tocius regni nostri, quod omnia\r\ncastra adulterina, videlicet ea que a principio guerre mote inter\r\ndominum Johannem patrem nostrum et barones suos Anglie constructa\r\nfuerint vel reedificata, statim diruantur. Quia vero nondum habuimus\r\nsigillum hanc [cartam] sigillis domini legati predicti et comitis\r\nWillelmi Mariscalli rectoris [nostri] et regni nostri fecimus sigillari.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     VIII. CARTA DE FORESTA.[1107]\r\n                          (6 NOVEMBER, 1217.)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1107:\r\n\r\n  See _supra_, pp. 171-2. The text is taken from that of the _Statutes\r\n  of the Realm_, I. 20-21.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHenricus Dei gratia rex Anglie, dominus Hibernie, dux Normannie,\r\nAquitanie et comes Andegavie, archiepiscopis, episcopis, abbatibus,\r\nprioribus, comitibus, baronibus, justiciariis, forestariis,\r\nvicecomitibus, prepositis, ministris, et omnibus ballivis et fidelibus\r\nsuis, salutem. Sciatis quod, intuitu Dei et pro salute anime nostre et\r\nanimarum antecessorum et successorum nostrorum, ad exaltacionem Sancte\r\nEcclesie et emendacionem regni nostri, concessimus et hac presenti carta\r\nconfirmavimus pro nobis et heredibus nostris in perpetuum, de consilio\r\nvenerabilis patris nostri domini Gualonis tituli sancti Martini\r\npresbiteri cardinalis et apostolice sedis legati, domini Walteri\r\nEboracensis archiepiscopi, Willelmi Londoniensis episcopi, et aliorum\r\nepiscoporum Anglie, et Willelmi Marescalli comitis Penbrocie, rectoris\r\nnostri et regni nostri, et aliorum fidelium comitum et baronum nostrorum\r\nAnglie, has libertates subscriptas tenendas in regno nostro Anglie, in\r\nperpetuum:\r\n\r\n1. In primis omnes foreste quas Henricus rex avus noster afforestavit\r\nvideantur per bonos et legales homines et, si boscum aliquem alium quam\r\nsuum dominicum afforestaverit ad dampnum illius cujus boscus fuerit,\r\ndeafforestentur. Et si boscum suum proprium afforestaverit, remaneat\r\nforesta, salva communa de herbagio et aliis in eadem foresta, illis qui\r\neam prius habere consueverunt.\r\n\r\n2. Homines qui manent extra forestam non veniant decetero coram\r\njusticiariis nostris de foresta per communes summoniciones, nisi sint in\r\nplacito, vel plegii alicujus vel aliquorum qui attachiati sunt propter\r\nforestam.\r\n\r\n3. Omnes autem bosci qui fuerunt afforestati per regem Ricardum\r\navunculum nostrum, vel per regem Johannem patrem nostrum usque ad primam\r\ncoronacionem nostram, statim deafforestentur, nisi fuerit dominicus\r\nboscus noster.\r\n\r\n4. Archiepiscopi, episcopi, abbates, priores, comites et barones et\r\nmilites et libere tenentes, qui boscos suos habent in forestis, habeant\r\nboscos suos sicut eos habuerunt tempore prime coronacionis predicti\r\nregis Henrici avi nostri, ita quod quieti sint in perpetuum de omnibus\r\npurpresturis, vastis et assartis factis in illis boscis, post illud\r\ntempus usque ad principium secundi anni coronacionis nostre. Et qui de\r\ncetero vastum, purpresturam, vel assartum sine licencia nostra in illis\r\nfecerint, de vastis et assartis respondeant.\r\n\r\n5. Reguardores nostri eant per forestas ad faciendum reguardum sicut\r\nfieri consuevit tempore prime coronacionis predicti regis Henrici avi\r\nnostri, et non aliter.\r\n\r\n6. Inquisicio, vel visus de expeditacione canum existencium in foresta,\r\ndecetero fiat quando debet fieri reguardum, scilicet de tercio anno in\r\ntercium annum; et tunc fiat per visum et testimonium legalium hominum et\r\nnon aliter. Et ille, cujus canis inventus fuerit tunc non expeditatus,\r\ndet pro misericordia tres solidos; et de cetero nullus bos capiatur pro\r\nexpeditacione. Talis autem sit expeditacio per assisam communiter quod\r\ntres ortilli abscidantur sine pelota de pede anteriori; nec expeditentur\r\ncanes de cetero, nisi in locis ubi consueverunt expeditari tempore prime\r\ncoronacionis regis Henrici avi nostri.\r\n\r\n7. Nullus forestarius vel bedellus decetero faciat scotale, vel colligat\r\ngarbas, vel avenam, vel bladum aliud, vel agnos, vel porcellos, nec\r\naliquam collectam faciant; et per visum et sacramentum duodecim\r\nreguardorum quando facient reguardum, tot forestarii ponantur ad\r\nforestas custodiendas, quot ad illas custodiendas rationabiliter\r\nviderint sufficere.\r\n\r\n8. Nullum suanimotum de cetero teneatur in regno nostro nisi ter in\r\nanno; videlicet in principio quindecim dierum ante festum Sancti\r\nMichaelis, quando agistatores conveniunt ad agistandum dominicos boscos\r\nnostros; et circa festum Sancti Martini quando agistatores nostri debent\r\nrecipere pannagium nostrum; et ad ista duo suanimota conveniant\r\nforestarii, viridarii, et agistatores, et nullus alius per\r\ndistrictionem; et tercium suanimotum teneatur in inicio quindecim dierum\r\nante festum Sancti Johannis Baptiste, pro feonacione bestiarum\r\nnostrarum; et ad istud suanimotum tenendum convenient forestarii et\r\nviridarii et nulli alii per districtionem. Et preterea singulis\r\nquadraginta diebus per totum annum conveniant viridarii et forestarii ad\r\nvidendum attachiamenta de foresta, tam de viridi, quam de venacione, per\r\npresentacionem ipsorum forestariorum, et coram ipsis attachiatis.\r\nPredicta autem suanimota non teneantur nisi in comitatibus in quibus\r\nteneri consueverunt.\r\n\r\n9. Unusquisque liber homo agistet boscum suum in foresta pro voluntate\r\nsua et habeat pannagium suum. Concedimus eciam quod unusquisque liber\r\nhomo possit ducere porcos suos per dominicum boscum nostrum, libere et\r\nsine inpedimento, ad agistandum eos in boscis suis propriis, vel alibi\r\nubi voluerit. Et si porci alicujus liberi hominis una nocte\r\npernoctaverint in foresta nostra, non inde occasionetur ita quod aliquid\r\nde suo perdat.\r\n\r\n10. Nullus de cetero amittat vitam vel menbra pro venacione nostra; set,\r\nsi aliquis captus fuerit et convictus de capcione venacionis, graviter\r\nredimatur, si habeat unde redimi possit; et si non habeat unde redimi\r\npossit, jaceat in prisona nostra per unum annum et unum diem; et, si\r\npost unum annum et unum diem plegios invenire possit, exeat a prisona;\r\nsin autem, adjuret regnum Anglie.\r\n\r\n11. Quicunque archiepiscopus, episcopus, comes vel baro transient per\r\nforestam nostram, liceat ei capere unam vel duas bestias per visum\r\nforestarii, si presens fuerit; sin autem, faciat cornari, ne videatur\r\nfurtive hoc facere.\r\n\r\n12. Unusquisque liber homo decetero sine occasione faciat in bosco suo,\r\nvel in terra sua quam habeat in foresta, molendinum, vivarium, stagnum,\r\nmarleram, fossatum, vel terram arabilem extra cooperatum in terra\r\narabili, ita quod non sit ad nocumentum alicujus vicini.\r\n\r\n13. Unusquisque liber homo habeat in boscis suis aereas, ancipitrum et\r\nspervariorum et falconum, aquilarum, et de heyrinis et habeat similiter\r\nmel quod inventum fuerit in boscis suis.\r\n\r\n14. Nullus forestarius de cetero, qui non sit forestarius de feudo\r\nreddens nobis firmam pro balliva sua, capiat chiminagium aliquod in\r\nballiva sua; forestarius autem de feudo firmam nobis reddens pro balliva\r\nsua capiat chiminagium, videlicet pro careta per dimidium annum duos\r\ndenarios, et per alium dimidium annum duos denarios, et pro equo qui\r\nportat sumagium per dimidium annum unum obolum, et per alium dimidium\r\nannum obolum, et non nisi de illis qui de extra ballivam suam, tanquam\r\nmercatores, veniunt per licenciam suam in ballivam suam ad buscam,\r\nmeremium, corticem vel carbonem emendum, et alias ducendum ad vendendum\r\nubi voluerint: et de nulla alia careta vel sumagio aliquod chiminagium\r\ncapiatur: et non capiatur chiminagium nisi in locis illis ubi antiquitus\r\ncapi solebat et debuit. Illi autem qui portant super dorsum suum buscam,\r\ncorticem, vel carbonem, ad vendendum, quamvis inde vivant, nullum de\r\ncetero dent chiminagium. De boscis autem aliorum nullum detur\r\nchiminagium forestariis nostris, preterquam de dominicis boscis nostris.\r\n\r\n15. Omnes utlagati pro foresta tantum a tempore regis Henrici avi nostri\r\nusque ad primam coronacionem nostram, veniant ad pacem nostram sine\r\ninpedimento, et salvos plegios inveniant quod de cetero non forisfaciant\r\nnobis de foresta nostra.\r\n\r\n16. Nullus castellanus vel alius ten eat placita de foresta sive de\r\nviridi sive de venacione, sed quilibet forestarius de feudo attachiet\r\nplacita de foresta tam de viridi quam de venacione, et ea presentet\r\nviridariis provinciarum et cum irrotulata fuerint et sub sigillis\r\nviridariorum inclusa, presententur capitali forestario cum in partes\r\nillas venerit ad tenendum placita foreste, et coram eo terminentur.\r\n\r\n17. Has autem libertates de forestis concessimus omnibus, salvis\r\narchiepiscopis, episcopis, abbatibus, prioribus, comitibus, baronibus,\r\nmilitibus et aliis tam personis ecclesiasticis quam secularibus,\r\nTemplariis et Hospitalariis, libertatibus et liberis consuetudinibus in\r\nforestis et extra, in warennis et aliis, quas prius habuerunt. Omnes\r\nautem istas consuetudines predictas et libertates, quas concessimus in\r\nregno nostro tenendas quantum ad nos pertinet erga nostros, omnes de\r\nregno nostro tam clerici quam laici observent quantum ad se pertinet\r\nerga suos. Quia vero sigillum nondum habuimus, presentem cartam sigillis\r\nvenerabilis patris nostri domini Gualonis tituli Sancti Martini\r\npresbiteri cardinalis, apostolice sedis legati, et Willelmi Marescalli\r\ncomitis Penbrok, rectoris nostri et regni nostri, fecimus sigillari.\r\nTestibus prenominatis et aliis multis. Datum per manus predictorum\r\ndomini legati et Willelmi Marescalli apud Sanctum Paulum Londonie, sexto\r\ndie Novembris, anno regni nostri secundo.\r\n\r\n        SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY AND LIST OF AUTHORITIES REFERRED TO.\r\n\r\n             I.

One summary of that Statute says that it “abolished appeals of\r\ntreason in parliament, and sent the accuser to established courts of\r\nlaw.” (Lolme, _The Constitution of England_, 1839, p. 137.)\r\n\r\nCoincidentally, a reference in the index entry for ‘Constables’ refers\r\nto ‘456 n.’ No note on that page mentions that topic. However, the\r\n‘Court of the Constable and Marshal’ _is_ mentioned in the same ‘425\r\nn.’, which is not indexed to that topic. We suggest that the reference\r\nto 425 n. was intended.\r\n\r\nLapses in the punctuation of index and footnote entries have been\r\nregularized with no further mention.\r\n\r\nOther errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected,\r\nand are noted here. The references are to the page and line in the\r\noriginal. Those with a third number refer to the line within a footnote\r\nbeginning on that page.\r\n\r\n 65.37      copyhold and leasehold[.]                      Restored.\r\n 83.118.4   go with the King an[d] serve him               Restored.\r\n 149.23     whether conscious or uncon[s]cious             Inserted.\r\n 219.328.1  a prisoner in Corfe Castle[.[                  Added.\r\n 307.31     to those of Charles II[.]                      Added.\r\n 323.37     twelve local gentlem[e/a]n                     Replaced.\r\n 367.20     for each county by p[r]icking at random        Removed.\r\n 386.3      he can have postpon[e]ment                     Inserted.\r\n 422.762.1  _En[t]stehung der S[ch]wurgerichte_            Inserted.\r\n 425.14     I[n/t] was unfair that he should be            Replaced.\r\n 435.793.1  _En[t]stehung der Schwurgerichte_              Inserted.\r\n 440.809.1  See _Placitorum Abbrev[i]atio_                 Inserted.\r\n 483.33     these high[ ]places of royal prerogative       Inserted.\r\n 488.914.3  to speak of \"agisting a wood,[”]               Added.\r\n 490.35     exercised functions anal[a/o]gous to those     Replaced.\r\n 537.11     to be otherwise acc[c]ording                   Removed.\r\n 540.1052.4 virtually her fellow-[p]risoners               Restored.\r\n 547.41     the said five-and[-]twenty barons              Restored.\r\n 577.37     manu nostra saisita[ saisita] fuerint          Removed.\r\n 588.33     sumagio aliquod chim[u/i]nagium capiatur       Replaced.\r\n 588.38     detur chiminagium for[i/e]stariis nostris      Replaced.\r\n 601.18     influence o[n/f] church on Charter             Replaced.",
