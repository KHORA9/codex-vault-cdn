Subsequently a decree was\r\nissued, announcing the emperor's resolve to establish amicable relations\r\nwith foreign countries, and \"declaring that any Japanese subject\r\nthereafter guilty of violent behaviour towards a foreigner would not\r\nonly act in opposition to the Imperial command, but would also be guilty\r\nof impairing the dignity and good faith of the nation in the eyes of the\r\npowers with which his majesty had pledged himself to maintain\r\nfriendship.\" From that time the relations between Japan and foreign\r\nstates grew yearly more amicable; the nation adopted the products of\r\nWestern civilization with notable thoroughness, and the provisions of\r\nthe treaties were carefully observed. Those treaties, however, presented\r\none feature which very soon became exceedingly irksome to Japan. They\r\nexempted foreigners residing within her borders from the operation of\r\nher criminal laws, and secured to them the privilege of being arraigned\r\nsolely before tribunals of their own nationality. That system had always\r\nbeen considered necessary where the subjects of Christian states visited\r\nor sojourned in non-Christian countries, and, for the purpose of giving\r\neffect to it, consular courts were established. This necessitated the\r\nconfinement of foreign residents to settlements in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe consular courts, since it would have been imprudent to allow\r\nforeigners to have free access to districts remote from the only\r\ntribunals competent to control them. The Japanese raised no objection to\r\nthe embodiment of this system in the treaties. They recognized its\r\nnecessity and even its expediency, for if, on the one hand, it infringed\r\ntheir country's sovereign rights, on the other, it prevented\r\ncomplications which must have ensued had they been entrusted with\r\njurisdiction which they were not prepared to discharge satisfactorily.\r\nBut the consular courts were not free from defects. A few of the powers\r\norganized competent tribunals presided over by judicial experts, but a\r\nmajority of the treaty states, not having sufficiently large interests\r\nat stake, were content to delegate consular duties to merchants, not\r\nonly deficient in legal training, but also themselves engaged in the\r\nvery commercial transactions upon which they might at any moment be\r\nrequired to adjudicate in a magisterial capacity. In any circumstances\r\nthe dual functions of consul and judge could not be discharged without\r\nanomaly by the same official, for he was obliged to act as advocate in\r\nthe preliminary stages of complications about which, in his position as\r\njudge, he might ultimately have to deliver an impartial verdict. In\r\npractice, however, the system worked with tolerable smoothness, and\r\nmight have remained long in force had not the patriotism of the Japanese\r\nrebelled bitterly against the implication that their country was unfit\r\nto exercise one of the fundamental attributes of every sovereign state,\r\njudicial autonomy. From the very outset they spared no effort to qualify\r\nfor the recovery of this attribute. Revision of the country's laws and\r\nreorganization of its law courts would necessarily have been an\r\nessential feature of the general reforms suggested by contact with the\r\nOccident, but the question of consular jurisdiction certainly\r\nconstituted a special incentive. Expert assistance was obtained from\r\nFrance and Germany; the best features of European jurisprudence were\r\nadapted to the conditions and usages of Japan; the law courts were\r\nremodelled, and steps were taken to educate a competent judiciary. In\r\ncriminal law the example of France was chiefly followed; in commercial\r\nlaw that of Germany; and in civil law that of the Occident generally,\r\nwith due regard to the customs of the country. The jury system was not\r\nadopted, collegiate courts being regarded as more conducive to justice,\r\nand the order of procedure went from tribunals of first instance to\r\nappeal courts and finally to the court of cassation. Schools of law were\r\nquickly opened, and a well-equipped bar soon came into existence. Twelve\r\nyears after the inception of these great works, Japan made formal\r\napplication for revision of the treaties on the basis of abolishing\r\nconsular jurisdiction. She had asked for revision in 1871, sending to\r\nEurope and America an important embassy to raise the question. But at\r\nthat time the conditions originally calling for consular jurisdiction\r\nhad not undergone any change such as would have justified its abolition,\r\nand the Japanese government, though very anxious to recover tariff\r\nautonomy as well as judicial, shrank from separating the two questions,\r\nlest by prematurely solving one the solution of the other might be\r\nunduly deferred. Thus the embassy failed, and though the problem\r\nattracted great academical interest from the first, it did not re-enter\r\nthe field of practical politics until 1883. The negotiations were long\r\nprotracted. Never previously had an Oriental state received at the hands\r\nof the Occident recognition such as that now demanded by Japan, and the\r\nWest naturally felt deep reluctance to try a wholly novel experiment.\r\nThe United States had set a generous example by concluding a new treaty\r\n(1878) on the lines desired by Japan. But its operation was conditional\r\non a similar act of compliance by the other treaty powers. Ill-informed\r\nEuropean publicists ridiculed the Washington statesmen's attitude on\r\nthis occasion, claiming that what had been given with one hand was taken\r\nback with the other. The truth is that the conditional provision was\r\ninserted at the request of Japan herself, who appreciated her own\r\nunpreparedness for the concession. From 1883, however, she was ready to\r\naccept full responsibility, and she therefore asked that all foreigners\r\nwithin her borders should thenceforth be subject to her laws and\r\njudiciable by her law-courts, supplementing her application by\r\npromising that its favourable reception should be followed by the\r\ncomplete opening of the country and the removal of all restrictions\r\nhitherto imposed on foreign trade, travel and residence in her realm.\r\n\"From the first it had been the habit of Occidental peoples to upbraid\r\nJapan on account of the barriers opposed by her to full and free foreign\r\nintercourse, and she was now able to claim that these barriers were no\r\nlonger maintained by her desire, but that they existed because of a\r\nsystem which theoretically proclaimed her unfitness for free association\r\nwith Western nations, and practically made it impossible for her to\r\nthrow open her territories completely for the ingress of foreigners.\"\r\nShe had a strong case, but on the side of the European powers extreme\r\nreluctance was manifested to try the unprecedented experiment of placing\r\ntheir people under the jurisdiction of an Oriental country. Still\r\ngreater was the reluctance of those upon whom the experiment would be\r\ntried. Foreigners residing in Japan naturally clung to consular\r\njurisdiction as a privilege of inestimable value. They saw, indeed, that\r\nsuch a system could not be permanently imposed on a country where the\r\nconditions justifying it had nominally disappeared. But they saw, also,\r\nthat the legal and judicial reforms effected by Japan had been crowded\r\ninto an extraordinarily brief period, and that, as tyros experimenting\r\nwith alien systems, the Japanese might be betrayed into many errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Recognition by the Powers.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations lasted for eleven years. They were begun in 1883 and a\r\nsolution was not reached until 1894. Finally European governments\r\nconceded the justice of Japan's case, and it was agreed that from July\r\n1899 Japanese tribunals should assume jurisdiction over every person, of\r\nwhatever nationality, within the confines of Japan, and the whole\r\ncountry should be thrown open to foreigners, all limitations upon trade,\r\ntravel and residence being removed. Great Britain took the lead in thus\r\nreleasing Japan from the fetters of the old system. The initiative came\r\nfrom her with special grace, for the system and all its irksome\r\nconsequences had been originally imposed on Japan by a combination of\r\npowers with Great Britain in the van. As a matter of historical sequence\r\nthe United States dictated the terms of the first treaty providing for\r\nconsular jurisdiction. But from a very early period the Washington\r\ngovernment showed its willingness to remove all limitations of Japan's\r\nsovereignty, whereas Europe, headed by Great Britain, whose\r\npreponderating interests entitled her to lead, resolutely refused to\r\nmake any substantial concession. In Japanese eyes, therefore, British\r\nconservatism seemed to be the one serious obstacle, and since the\r\nBritish residents in the settlements far outnumbered all other\r\nnationalities, and since they alone had newspaper organs to ventilate\r\ntheir grievances--it was certainly fortunate for the popularity of her\r\npeople in the Far East that Great Britain saw her way finally to set a\r\nliberal example. Nearly five years were required to bring the other\r\nOccidental powers into line with Great Britain and America. It should be\r\nstated, however, that neither reluctance to make the necessary\r\nconcessions nor want of sympathy with Japan caused the delay. The\r\nexplanation is, first, that each set of negotiators sought to improve\r\neither the terms or the terminology of the treaties already concluded,\r\nand, secondly, that the tariff arrangements for the different countries\r\nrequired elaborate discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Reception given to the Revised Treaties.\r\n\r\nUntil the last of the revised treaties was ratified, voices of protest\r\nagainst revision continued to be vehemently raised by a large section of\r\nthe foreign community in the settlements. Some were honestly\r\napprehensive as to the issue of the experiment. Others were swayed by\r\nracial prejudice. A few had fallen into an insuperable habit of\r\ngrumbling, or found their account in advocating conservatism under\r\npretence of championing foreign interests; and all were naturally\r\nreluctant to forfeit the immunity from taxation hitherto enjoyed. It\r\nseemed as though the inauguration of the new system would find the\r\nforeign community in a mood which must greatly diminish the chances of a\r\nhappy result, for where a captious and aggrieved disposition exists,\r\nopportunities to discover causes of complaint cannot be wanting. But at\r\nthe eleventh hour this unfavourable demeanour underwent a marked change.\r\nSo soon as it became evident that the old system was hopelessly doomed,\r\nthe sound common sense of the European and American business man\r\nasserted itself. The foreign residents let it be seen that they intended\r\nto bow cheerfully to the inevitable, and that no obstacles would be\r\nwillingly placed by them in the path of Japanese jurisdiction. The\r\nJapanese, on their side, took some promising steps. An Imperial rescript\r\ndeclared in unequivocal terms that it was the sovereign's policy and\r\ndesire to abolish all distinctions between natives and foreigners, and\r\nthat by fully carrying out the friendly purpose of the treaties his\r\npeople would best consult his wishes, maintain the character of the\r\nnation, and promote its prestige. The premier and other ministers of\r\nstate issued instructions to the effect that the responsibility now\r\ndevolved on the government, and the duty on the people, of enabling\r\nforeigners to reside confidently and contentedly in every part of the\r\ncountry. Even the chief Buddhist prelates addressed to the priests and\r\nparishioners in their dioceses injunctions pointing out that, freedom of\r\nconscience being now guaranteed by the constitution, men professing\r\nalien creeds must be treated as courteously as the followers of\r\nBuddhism, and must enjoy the same rights and privileges.\r\n\r\nThus the great change was effected in circumstances of happy augury. Its\r\nresults were successful on the whole. Foreigners residing in Japan now\r\nenjoy immunity of domicile, personal and religious liberty, freedom from\r\nofficial interference, and security of life and property as fully as\r\nthough they were living in their own countries, and they have gradually\r\nlearned to look with greatly increased respect upon Japanese law and its\r\nadministrators.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Anglo-Japanese Alliance.\r\n\r\nNext to the revision of the treaties and to the result of the great wars\r\nwaged by Japan since the resumption of foreign intercourse, the most\r\nmemorable incident in her modern career was the conclusion, first, of an\r\n_entente_, and, secondly, of an offensive and defensive alliance with\r\nGreat Britain in January 1902 and September 1905, respectively. The\r\n_entente_ set out by disavowing on the part of each of the contracting\r\nparties any aggressive tendency in either China or Korea, the\r\nindependence of which two countries was explicitly recognized; and went\r\non to declare that Great Britain in China and Japan in China and Korea\r\nmight take indispensable means to safeguard their interests; while, if\r\nsuch measures involved one of the signatories in war with a third power,\r\nthe other signatory would not only remain neutral but would also\r\nendeavour to prevent other powers from joining in hostilities against\r\nits ally, and would come to the assistance of the latter in the event of\r\nits being faced by two or more powers. The _entente_ further recognized\r\nthat Japan possessed, in a peculiar degree, political, commercial and\r\nindustrial interests in Korea. This agreement, equally novel for each of\r\nthe contracting parties, evidently tended to the benefit of Japan more\r\nthan to that of Great Britain, inasmuch as the interests in question\r\nwere vital from the former power's point of view but merely local from\r\nthe latter's. The inequality was corrected by an offensive and defensive\r\nalliance in 1905. For the scope of the agreement was then extended to\r\nIndia and eastern Asia generally, and while the signatories pledged\r\nthemselves, on the one hand, to preserve the common interests of all\r\npowers in China by insuring her integrity and independence as well as\r\nthe principle of equal opportunities for the commerce and industry of\r\nall nations within her borders, they agreed, on the other, to maintain\r\ntheir own territorial rights in eastern Asia and India, and to come to\r\neach other's armed assistance in the event of those rights being\r\nassailed by any other power or powers. These agreements have, of course,\r\na close relation to the events which accompanied or immediately preceded\r\nthem, but they also present a vivid and radical contrast between a\r\ncountry which, less than half a century previously, had struggled\r\nvehemently to remain secluded from the world, and a country which now\r\nallied itself with one of the most liberal and progressive nations for\r\nthe purposes of a policy extending over the whole of eastern Asia and\r\nIndia. This contrast was accentuated two years later (1907) when France\r\nand Russia concluded _ententes_ with Japan, recognizing the independence\r\nand integrity of the Chinese Empire, as well as the principle of equal\r\nopportunity for all nations in that country, and engaging to support\r\neach other for assuring peace and security there. Japan thus became a\r\nworld power in the most unequivocal sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n  War with Korea.\r\n\r\n_Japan's Foreign Wars and Complications._--The earliest foreign war\r\nconducted by Japan is said to have taken place at the beginning of the\r\n3rd century, when the empress Jingo led an army to the conquest of\r\nKorea. But as the event is supposed to have happened more than 500 years\r\nbefore the first Japanese record was written, its traditional details\r\ncannot be seriously discussed. There is, however, no room to doubt that\r\nfrom time to time in early ages Japanese troops were seen in Korea,\r\nthough they made no permanent impression on the country. It was reserved\r\nfor Hideyoshi, the taiko, to make the Korean peninsula the scene of a\r\ngreat over-sea campaign. Hideyoshi, the Napoleon of Japan, having\r\nbrought the whole empire under his sway as the sequel of many years of\r\nincomparable generalship and statecraft, conceived the project of\r\nsubjugating China. By some historians his motive has been described as a\r\ndesire to find employment for the immense mob of armed men whom four\r\ncenturies of almost continuous fighting had called into existence in\r\nJapan: he felt that domestic peace could not be permanently restored\r\nunless these restless spirits were occupied abroad. But although that\r\nobject may have reinforced his purpose, his ambition aimed at nothing\r\nless than the conquest of China, and he regarded Korea merely as a\r\nstepping-stone to that aim. Had Korea consented to be put to such a use,\r\nshe need not have fought or suffered. The Koreans, however, counted\r\nChina invincible. They considered that Japan would be shattered by the\r\nfirst contact with the great empire, and therefore although, in the 13th\r\ncentury, they had given the use of their harbours to the Mongol invaders\r\nof Japan, they flatly refused in the 16th to allow their territory to be\r\nused for a Japanese invasion of China. On the 24th of May 1592 the wave\r\nof invasion rolled against Korea's southern coast. Hideyoshi had chosen\r\nNagoya in the province of Hizen as the home-base of his operations.\r\nThere the sea separating Japan from the Korean peninsula narrows to a\r\nstrait divided into two channels of almost equal width by the island of\r\nTsushima. To reach this island from the Japanese side was an easy and\r\nsafe task, but in the 56-mile channel that separated Tsushima from the\r\npeninsula an invading flotilla had to run the risk of attack by Korean\r\nwar-ships. At Nagoya Hideyoshi assembled an army of over 300,000 men, of\r\nwhom some 70,000 constituted the first fighting line, 87,000 the second,\r\nand the remainder formed a reserve to be subsequently drawn on as\r\noccasion demanded. The question of transport presented some difficulty,\r\nbut it was solved by the simple expedient of ordering every feudatory to\r\nfurnish two ships for each 100,000 _koku_ of his fief's revenue. These\r\nwere not fighting vessels but mere transports. As for the plan of\r\ncampaign, it was precisely in accord with modern principles of strategy,\r\nand bore witness to the daring genius of Hideyoshi. The van, consisting\r\nof three army corps and mustering in all 51,000 men, was to cross\r\nrapidly to Fusan, on the south coast of the peninsula, and immediately\r\ncommence a movement northward towards the capital, Seoul, one corps\r\nmoving by the eastern coast-road, one by the central route, and one by\r\nthe western coast-line. Thereafter the other four corps, which formed\r\nthe first fighting line, together with the corps under the direct orders\r\nof the commander-in-chief, Ukida Hideiye, were to cross, for the purpose\r\nof effectually subduing the regions through which the van had passed;\r\nand, finally, the two remaining corps of the second line were to be\r\ntransported by sea up the west coast of the peninsula, to form a\r\njunction with the van which, by that time, should be preparing to pass\r\ninto China over the northern boundary of Korea, namely, the Yalu River.\r\nFor the landing place of these reinforcements the town of Phyong-yang\r\nwas adopted, being easily accessible by the Taidong River from the\r\ncoast. In later ages Japanese armies were destined to move twice over\r\nthese same regions, once to the invasion of China, once to the attack of\r\nRussia, and they adopted almost the same strategical plan as that mapped\r\nout by Hideyoshi in the year 1592. The forecast was that the Koreans\r\nwould offer their chief resistance, first, at the capital, Seoul; next\r\nat Phyong-yang, and finally at the Yalu, as the approaches to all these\r\nplaces offered positions capable of being utilized to great advantage\r\nfor defensive purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Landing In Korea and Advance of the Invaders.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of May 1592 the first army corps, under the command of\r\nKonishi Yukinaga, crossed unmolested to the peninsula; next day the\r\ncastle of Fusan was carried by storm, which same fate befell, on the\r\n27th, another and stronger fortress lying 3 miles inland and garrisoned\r\nby 20,000 picked soldiers. The invaders were irresistible. From the\r\nlanding-place at Fusan to the gates of Seoul the distance is 267 miles.\r\nKonishi's corps covered that interval in 19 days, storming two forts,\r\ncarrying two positions and fighting one pitched battle _en route_. On\r\nthe 12th of June the Korean capital was in Japanese hands, and by the\r\n16th four army corps had assembled there, while four others had effected\r\na landing at Fusan. After a rest of 15 days the northward advance was\r\nresumed, and July 15th saw Phyong-yang in Japanese possession. The\r\ndistance of 130 miles from Seoul to the Taidong had been traversed in 18\r\ndays, 10 having been occupied in forcing the passage of a river which,\r\nif held with moderate resolution and skill, should have stopped the\r\nJapanese altogether. At this point, however, the invasion suffered a\r\ncheck owing to a cause which in modern times has received much\r\nattention, though in Hideyoshi's days it had been little considered; the\r\nJapanese lost the command of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Fighting at Sea.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese idea of sea-fighting in those times was to use open boats\r\npropelled chiefly by oars. They closed as quickly as possible with the\r\nenemy, and then fell on with the trenchant swords which they used so\r\nskilfully. Now during the 15th century and part of the 16th the Chinese\r\nhad been so harassed by Japanese piratical raids that their inventive\r\ngenius, quickened by suffering, suggested a device for coping with these\r\nformidable adversaries. Once allow the Japanese swordsman to come to\r\nclose quarters and he carried all before him. To keep him at a distance,\r\nthen, was the great desideratum, and the Chinese compassed this in\r\nmaritime warfare by completely covering their boats with roofs of solid\r\ntimber, so that those within were protected against missiles, while\r\nloop-holes and ports enabled them to pour bullets and arrows on a foe.\r\nThe Koreans learned this device from the Chinese and were the first to\r\nemploy it in actual warfare. Their own history alleges that they\r\nimproved upon the Chinese model by nailing sheet iron over the roofs and\r\nsides of the \"turtle-shell\" craft and studding the whole surface with\r\n_chevaux de frise_, but Japanese annals indicate that in the great\r\nmajority of cases solid timber alone was used. It seems strange that the\r\nJapanese should have been without any clear perception of the immense\r\nfighting superiority possessed by such protected war-vessels over small\r\nopen boats. But certainly they were either ignorant or indifferent. The\r\nfleet which they provided to hold the command of Korean waters did not\r\ninclude one vessel of any magnitude; it consisted simply of some\r\nhundreds of row-boats manned by 7000 men. Hideyoshi himself was perhaps\r\nnot without misgivings. Six years previously he had endeavoured to\r\nobtain two war-galleons from the Portuguese, and had he succeeded, the\r\nhistory of the Far East might have been radically different. Evidently,\r\nhowever, he committed a blunder which his countrymen in modern times\r\nhave conspicuously avoided; he drew the sword without having fully\r\ninvestigated his adversary's resources. Just about the time when the van\r\nof the Japanese army was entering Seoul, the Korean admiral, Yi Sun-sin,\r\nat the head of a fleet of 80 vessels, attacked the Japanese squadron\r\nwhich lay at anchor near the entrance to Fusan harbour, set 26 of the\r\nvessels on fire and dispersed the rest. Four other engagements ensued in\r\nrapid succession. The last and most important took place shortly after\r\nthe Japanese troops had seized Phyong-yang. It resulted in the sinking\r\nof over 70 Japanese vessels, transports and fighting ships combined,\r\nwhich formed the main part of a flotilla carrying reinforcements by sea\r\nto the van of the invading army. This despatch of troops and supplies by\r\nwater had been a leading feature of Hideyoshi's plan of campaign, and\r\nthe destruction of the flotilla to which the duty was entrusted may be\r\nsaid to have sealed the fate of the war by isolating the army in Korea\r\nfrom its home base. It is true that Konishi Yukinaga, who commanded the\r\nfirst division, would have continued his northward march from\r\nPhyong-yang without delay. He argued that China was wholly unprepared,\r\nand that the best hope of ultimate victory lay in not giving her time to\r\ncollect her forces. But the commander-in-chief, Ukida Hideiye, refused\r\nto endorse this plan. He took the view that since the Korean provinces\r\nwere still offering desperate resistance, supplies could not be drawn\r\nfrom them, neither could the troops engaged in subjugating them be freed\r\nfor service at the front. Therefore it was essential to await the\r\nconsummation of the second phase of Hideyoshi's plan, namely, the\r\ndespatch of reinforcements and munitions by water to Phyong-yang. The\r\nreader has seen how that second phase fared. The Japanese commander at\r\nPhyong-yang never received any accession of strength. His force suffered\r\nconstant diminution from casualties, and the question of commissariat\r\nbecame daily more difficult. It is further plain to any reader of\r\nhistory--and Japanese historians themselves admit the fact--that no wise\r\neffort was made to conciliate the Korean people. They were treated so\r\nharshly that even the humble peasant took up arms, and thus the\r\npeninsula, instead of serving as a basis of supplies, had to be\r\ngarrisoned perpetually by a strong army.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chinese Intervention.\r\n\r\nThe Koreans, having suffered for their loyalty to China, naturally\r\nlooked to her for succour. Again and again appeals were made to Peking,\r\nand at length a force of 5000 men, which had been mobilized in the\r\nLiaotung peninsula, crossed the Yalu and moved south to Phyong-yang,\r\nwhere the Japanese van had been lying idle for over two months. This was\r\nearly in October 1592. Memorable as the first encounter between Japanese\r\nand Chinese, the incident also illustrated China's supreme confidence in\r\nher own ineffable superiority. The whole of the Korean forces had been\r\ndriven northward throughout the entire length of the peninsula by the\r\nJapanese armies, yet Peking considered that 5000 Chinese \"braves\" would\r\nsuffice to roll back this tide of invasion. Three thousand of the\r\nChinese were killed and the remainder fled pell-mell across the Yalu.\r\nChina now began to be seriously alarmed. She collected an army variously\r\nestimated at from 51,000 to 200,000 men, and marching it across\r\nManchuria in the dead of winter, hurled it against Phyong-yang during\r\nthe first week of February 1593. The Japanese garrison did not exceed\r\n20,000, nearly one-half of its original number having been detached to\r\nhold a line of forts which guarded the communications with Seoul.\r\nMoreover, the Chinese, though their swords were much inferior to the\r\nJapanese weapon, possessed great superiority in artillery and cavalry,\r\nas well as in the fact that their troopers wore iron mail which defied\r\nthe keenest blade. Thus, after a severe fight, the Japanese had to\r\nevacuate Phyong-yang and fall back upon Seoul. But this one victory\r\nalone stands to China's credit. In all subsequent encounters of any\r\nmagnitude her army suffered heavy defeats, losing on one occasion some\r\n10,000 men, on another 4000, and on a third 39,000. But the presence of\r\nher forces and the determined resistance offered by the Koreans\r\neffectually saved China from invasion. Indeed, after the evacuation of\r\nSeoul, on the 9th of May 1593, Hideyoshi abandoned all idea of carrying\r\nthe war into Chinese territory, and devoted his attention to obtaining\r\nhonourable terms of peace, the Japanese troops meanwhile holding a line\r\nof forts along the southern coast of Korea. He died before that end had\r\nbeen accomplished. Had he lived a few days longer, he would have learned\r\nof a crushing defeat inflicted on the Chinese forces (at Sö-chhön,\r\nOctober 30, 1598), when the Satsuma men under Shimazu Yoshihiro took\r\n38,700 Chinese heads and sent the noses and ears to Japan, where they\r\nnow lie buried under a tumulus (_mimizuka_, ear-mound) near the temple\r\nof Daibutsu in Kioto. Thereafter the statesmen to whom the regent on his\r\ndeath-bed had entrusted the duty of terminating the struggle and\r\nrecalling the troops, intimated to the enemy that the evacuation of the\r\npeninsula might be obtained if a Korean prince repaired to Japan as\r\nenvoy, and if some tiger-skins and _ginseng_ were sent to Kioto in token\r\nof amity. So ended one of the greatest over-sea campaigns recorded in\r\nhistory. It had lasted 6½ years, had seen 200,000 Japanese troops at one\r\ntime on Korean soil, and had cost something like a quarter of a million\r\nlives.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Contrast between Foreign Relations in Medieval and Modern Times.\r\n\r\nFrom the recall of the Korea expedition in 1598 to the resumption of\r\nintercourse with the Occident in modern times, Japan enjoyed\r\nuninterrupted peace with foreign nations. Thereafter she had to engage\r\nin four wars. It is a striking contrast. During the first eleven\r\ncenturies of her historical existence she was involved in only one\r\ncontest abroad; during the next half century she fought four times\r\nbeyond the sea and was confronted by many complications. Whatever\r\nmaterial or moral advantages her association with the West conferred on\r\nher, it did not bring peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The \"Maria Luz\" Complication.\r\n\r\nThe first menacing foreign complication with which the Japanese\r\ngovernment of the Meiji era had to deal was connected with the traffic\r\nin Chinese labour, an abuse not yet wholly eradicated. In 1872, a\r\nPeruvian ship, the \"Maria Luz,\" put into port at Yokohama, carrying 200\r\ncontract labourers. One of the unfortunate men succeeded in reaching the\r\nshore and made a piteous appeal to the Japanese authorities, who at once\r\nseized the vessel and released her freight of slaves, for they were\r\nlittle better. The Japanese had not always been so particular. In the\r\ndays of early foreign intercourse, before England's attitude towards\r\nslavery had established a new code of ethics, Portuguese ships had been\r\npermitted to carry away from Hirado, as they did from Macao, cargoes of\r\nmen and women, doomed to a life of enforced toil if they survived the\r\nhorrors of the voyage. But modern Japan followed the tenets of modern\r\nmorality in such matters. Of course the Peruvian government protested,\r\nand for a time relations were strained almost to the point of rupture;\r\nbut it was finally agreed that the question should be submitted to the\r\narbitration of the tsar, who decided in Japan's favour. Japan's attitude\r\nin this affair elicited applause, not merely from the point of view of\r\nhumanity, but also because of the confidence she showed in Occidental\r\njustice.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Sakhalin Complication.\r\n\r\nAnother complication which occupied the attention of the Tokyo\r\ngovernment from the beginning of the Meiji era was in truth a legacy\r\nfrom the days of feudalism. In those days the island of Yezo, as well as\r\nSakhalin on its north-west and the Kurile group on its north, could\r\nscarcely be said to be in effective Japanese occupation. It is true that\r\nthe feudal chief of Matsumae (now Fuku-yama), the remains of whose\r\ncastle may still be seen on the coast at the southern extremity of the\r\nisland of Yezo, exercised nominal jurisdiction; but his functions did\r\nnot greatly exceed the levying of taxes on the aboriginal inhabitants of\r\nYezo, the Kuriles and southern Sakhalin. Thus from the beginning of the\r\n18th century Russian fishermen began to settle in the Kuriles and\r\nRussian ships menaced Sakhalin. There can be no doubt that the first\r\nexplorers of Sakhalin were Japanese. As early as 1620, some vassals of\r\nthe feudal chief of Matsumae visited the place and passed a winter\r\nthere. It was then supposed to be a peninsula forming part of the\r\nAsiatic mainland, but in 1806 a daring Japanese traveller, by name\r\nMamiya Rinzo, made his way to Manchuria, voyaged up and down the Amur,\r\nand, crossing to Sakhalin, discovered that a narrow strait separated it\r\nfrom the mainland. There still prevails in the minds of many Occidentals\r\na belief that the discovery of Sakhalin's insular character was reserved\r\nfor Captain Nevelskoy, a Russian, who visited the place in 1849, but in\r\nJapan the fact had then been known for 43 years. Muravief, the great\r\nRussian empire-builder in East Asia, under whose orders Nevelskoy acted,\r\nquickly appreciated the necessity of acquiring Sakhalin, which commands\r\nthe estuary of the Amur. After the conclusion of the treaty of Aigun\r\n(1857) he visited Japan with a squadron, and required that the strait of\r\nLa Pérouse, which separates Sakhalin from Yezo, should be regarded as\r\nthe frontier between Russia and Japan. This would have given the whole\r\nof Sakhalin to Russia. Japan refused, and Muravief immediately resorted\r\nto the policy he had already pursued with signal success in the Usuri\r\nregion: he sent emigrants to settle in Sakhalin. Twice the shogunate\r\nattempted to frustrate this process of gradual absorption by proposing a\r\ndivision of the island along the 50th parallel of north latitude, and\r\nfinally, in 1872, the Meiji government offered to purchase the Russian\r\nportion for 2,000,000 dollars (then equivalent to about £400,000). St\r\nPetersburg, having by that time discovered the comparative worthlessness\r\nof the island as a wealth-earning possession, showed some signs of\r\nacquiescence, and possibly an agreement might have been reached had not\r\na leading Japanese statesman--afterwards Count Kuroda--opposed the\r\nbargain as disadvantageous to Japan. Finally St Petersburg's\r\nperseverance won the day. In 1875 Japan agreed to recognize Russia's\r\ntitle to the whole island on condition that Russia similarly recognized\r\nJapan's title to the Kuriles. It was a singular compact. Russia\r\npurchased a Japanese property and paid for it with a part of Japan's\r\nbelongings. These details form a curious preface to the fact that\r\nSakhalin was destined, 30 years later, to be the scene of a Japanese\r\ninvasion, in the sequel of which it was divided along the 50th parallel\r\nas the shogun's administration had originally proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Military Expedition to Formosa.\r\n\r\nThe first of Japan's four conflicts was an expedition to Formosa in\r\n1874. Insignificant from a military point of view, this affair derives\r\nvicarious interest from its effect upon the relations between China and\r\nJapan, and upon the question of the ownership of the Riukiu islands.\r\nThese islands, which lie at a little distance south of Japan, had for\r\ncenturies been regarded as an apanage of the Satsuma fief. The language\r\nand customs of their inhabitants showed unmistakable traces of\r\nrelationship to the Japanese, and the possibility of the islands being\r\nincluded among the dominions of China had probably never occurred to any\r\nJapanese statesman. When therefore, in 1873, the crew of a wrecked\r\nRiukiuan junk were barbarously treated by the inhabitants of northern\r\nFormosa, the Japanese government unhesitatingly assumed the\r\nresponsibility of seeking redress for their outrage. Formosa being a\r\npart of the Chinese Empire, complaint was duly preferred in Peking. But\r\nthe Chinese authorities showed such resolute indifference to Japan's\r\nrepresentations that the latter finally took the law into her own hands,\r\nand sent a small force to punish the Formosan murderers, who, of course,\r\nwere found quite unable to offer any serious resistance. The Chinese\r\ngovernment, now recognizing the fact that its territories had been\r\ninvaded, lodged a protest which, but for the intervention of the British\r\nminister in Peking, might have involved the two empires in war. The\r\nfinal terms of arrangement were that, in consideration of Japan\r\nwithdrawing her troops from Formosa, China should indemnify her to the\r\nextent of the expenses of the expedition. In sending this expedition to\r\nFormosa the government sought to placate the Satsuma samurai, who were\r\nbeginning to show much opposition to certain features of the\r\nadministrative reforms just inaugurated, and who claimed special\r\ninterest in the affairs of the Riukiu islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Riukiu Complication.\r\n\r\nHad Japan needed any confirmation of her belief that the Riukiu islands\r\nbelonged to her, the incidents and settlement of the Formosan\r\ncomplication would have constituted conclusive evidence. Thus in 1876\r\nshe did not hesitate to extend her newly organized system of prefectural\r\ngovernment to Riukiu, which thenceforth became the Okinawa prefecture,\r\nthe former ruler of the islands being pensioned, according to the system\r\nfollowed in the case of the feudal chiefs in Japan proper. China at once\r\nentered an objection. She claimed that Riukiu had always been a\r\ntributary of her empire, and she was doubtless perfectly sincere in the\r\ncontention. But China's interpretation of tribute did not seem\r\nreducible to a working theory. So long as her own advantage could be\r\npromoted, she regarded as a token of vassalage the presents periodically\r\ncarried to her court from neighbouring states. So soon, however, as\r\nthere arose any question of discharging a suzerain's duties, she classed\r\nthese offerings as insignificant interchanges of neighbourly courtesy.\r\nIt was true that Riukiu had followed the custom of despatching\r\ngift-bearing envoys to China from time to time, just as Japan herself\r\nhad done, though with less regularity. But it was also true that Riukiu\r\nhad been subdued by Satsuma without China stretching out a hand to help\r\nher; that for two centuries the islands had been included in the Satsuma\r\nfief, and that China, in the sequel to the Formosan affair, had made a\r\npractical acknowledgment of Japan's superior title to protect the\r\nislanders. Each empire positively asserted its claims; but whereas Japan\r\nput hers into practice, China confined herself to remonstrances. Things\r\nremained in that state until 1880, when General Grant, visiting the\r\nEast, suggested the advisability of a compromise. A conference met in\r\nPeking, and the plenipotentiaries agreed that the islands should be\r\ndivided, Japan taking the northern group, China the southern. But on the\r\neve of signature the Chinese plenipotentiary drew back, pleading that he\r\nhad no authority to conclude an agreement without previously referring\r\nit to certain other dignitaries. Japan, sensible that she had been\r\nflouted, retired from the discussion and retained the islands, China's\r\nshare in them being reduced to a grievance.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Korean Complication.\r\n\r\nFrom the 16th century, when the Korean peninsula was overrun by Japanese\r\ntroops, its rulers made a habit of sending a present-bearing embassy to\r\nJapan to felicitate the accession of each shogun. But after the fall of\r\nthe Tokugawa shogunate, the Korean court desisted from this custom,\r\ndeclared a determination to have no further relations with a country\r\nembracing Western civilization, and refused even to receive a Japanese\r\nembassy. This conduct caused deep umbrage in Japan. Several prominent\r\npoliticians cast their votes for war, and undoubtedly the sword would\r\nhave been drawn had not the leading statesmen felt that a struggle with\r\nKorea, involving probably a rupture with China, must fatally check the\r\nprogress of the administrative reforms then (1873) in their infancy. Two\r\nyears later, however, the Koreans crowned their defiance by firing on\r\nthe boats of a Japanese war-vessel engaged in the operation of\r\ncoast-surveying. No choice now remained except to despatch an armed\r\nexpedition against the truculent kingdom. But Japan did not want to\r\nfight. In this matter she showed herself an apt pupil of Occidental\r\nmethods such as had been practised against herself in former years. She\r\nassembled an imposing force of war-ships and transports, but instead of\r\nproceeding to extremities, she employed the squadron--which was by no\r\nmeans so strong as it seemed--to intimidate Korea into signing a treaty\r\nof amity and commerce, and opening three ports to foreign trade (1876).\r\nThat was the beginning of Korea's friendly relations with the outer\r\nworld, and Japan naturally took credit for the fact that, thus early in\r\nher new career, she had become an instrument for extending the principle\r\nof universal intercourse opposed so strenuously by herself in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n  War with China.\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial China's policy towards the petty states on her\r\nfrontiers had been to utilize them as buffers for softening the shock of\r\nforeign contact, while contriving, at the same time, that her relations\r\nwith them should involve no inconvenient responsibilities for herself.\r\nThe aggressive impulses of the outside world were to be checked by an\r\nunproclaimed understanding that the territories of these states partook\r\nof the inviolability of China, while the states, on their side, must\r\nnever expect their suzerain to bear the consequences of their acts. This\r\narrangement, depending largely on sentiment and prestige, retained its\r\nvalidity in the atmosphere of Oriental seclusion, but quickly failed to\r\nendure the test of modern Occidental practicality. Tongking, Annam, Siam\r\nand Burma were withdrawn, one by one, from the fiction of dependence on\r\nChina and independence towards all other countries. But with regard to\r\nKorea, China proved more tenacious. The possession of the peninsula by\r\na foreign power would have threatened the maritime route to the Chinese\r\ncapital and given easy access to Manchuria, the cradle of the dynasty\r\nwhich ruled China. Therefore Peking statesmen endeavoured to preserve\r\nthe old-time relations with the little kingdom. But they could never\r\npersuade themselves to modify the indirect methods sanctioned by\r\ntradition. Instead of boldly declaring Korea a dependency of China, they\r\nsought to keep up the romance of ultimate dependency and intermediate\r\nsovereignty. Thus in 1876 Korea was suffered to conclude with Japan a\r\ntreaty of which the first article declared her \"an independent state\r\nenjoying the same rights as Japan,\" and subsequently to make with the\r\nUnited States (1882), Great Britain (1883) and other powers, treaties in\r\nwhich her independence was constructively admitted. China, however, did\r\nnot intend that Korea should exercise the independence thus\r\nconventionally recognized. A Chinese resident was placed in Seoul, and a\r\nsystem of steady though covert interference in Korea's affairs was\r\ninaugurated. The chief sufferer from these anomalous conditions was\r\nJapan. In all her dealings with Korea, in all complications that arose\r\nout of her comparatively large trade with the peninsula, in all\r\nquestions connected with her numerous settlers there, she found herself\r\nnegotiating with a dependency of China, and with officials who took\r\ntheir orders from the Chinese representative. China had long entertained\r\na rooted apprehension of Japanese aggression in Korea--an apprehension\r\nnot unwarranted by history--and that distrust tinged all the influence\r\nexerted by her agents there. On many occasions Japan was made sensible\r\nof the discrimination thus exercised against her. Little by little the\r\nconsciousness roused her indignation, and although no single instance\r\nconstituted a ground for strong international protest, the Japanese\r\npeople gradually acquired a sense of being perpetually baffled, thwarted\r\nand humiliated by China's interference in Korean affairs. For thirty\r\nyears China had treated Japan as a contemptible deserter from the\r\nOriental standard, and had regarded her progressive efforts with openly\r\ndisdainful aversion; while Japan, on her side, had chafed more and more\r\nto furnish some striking evidence of the wisdom of her preference for\r\nWestern civilization. Even more serious were the consequences of Chinese\r\ninterference from the point of view of Korean administration. The rulers\r\nof the country lost all sense of national responsibility, and gave\r\nunrestrained sway to selfish ambition. The functions of the judiciary\r\nand of the executive alike came to be discharged by bribery only. Family\r\ninterests predominated over those of the state. Taxes were imposed in\r\nproportion to the greed of local officials. No thought whatever was\r\ntaken for the welfare of the people or for the development of the\r\ncountry's resources. Personal responsibility was unknown among\r\nofficials. To be a member of the Min family, to which the queen\r\nbelonged, was to possess a passport to office and an indemnity against\r\nthe consequences of abuse of power. From time to time the advocates of\r\nprogress or the victims of oppression rose in arms. They effected\r\nnothing except to recall to the world's recollection the miserable\r\ncondition into which Korea had fallen. Chinese military aid was always\r\nfurnished readily for the suppression of these risings, and thus the Min\r\nfamily learned to base its tenure of power on ability to conciliate\r\nChina and on readiness to obey Chinese dictation, while the people at\r\nlarge fell into the apathetic condition of men who possess neither\r\nsecurity of property nor national ambition.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of state policy the Korean problem caused much anxiety to\r\nJapan. Her own security being deeply concerned in preserving Korea from\r\nthe grasp of a Western power, she could not suffer the little kingdom to\r\ndrift into a condition of such administrative incompetence and national\r\ndebility that a strong aggressor might find at any moment a pretext for\r\ninterference. On two occasions (1882 and 1884) when China's armed\r\nintervention was employed in the interests of the Min to suppress\r\nmovements of reform, the partisans of the victors, regarding Japan as\r\nthe fountain of progressive tendencies, destroyed her legation in Seoul\r\nand compelled its inmates to fly from the city. Japan behaved with\r\nforbearance at these crises, but in the consequent negotiations she\r\nacquired conventional titles that touched the core of China's alleged\r\nsuzerainty. In 1882 her right to maintain troops in Seoul for the\r\nprotection of her legation was admitted; in 1885 she concluded with\r\nChina a convention by which each power pledged itself not to send troops\r\nto Korea without notifying the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Rupture with China.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1894 a serious insurrection broke out in Korea, and the\r\nMin family appealed for China's aid. On the 6th of July 2500 Chinese\r\ntroops embarked at Tientsin and were transported to the peninsula, where\r\nthey went into camp at Ya-shan (Asan), on the south-west coast, notice\r\nof the measure being given by the Chinese government to the Japanese\r\nrepresentative at Peking, according to treaty. During the interval\r\nimmediately preceding these events, Japan had been rendered acutely\r\nsensible of China's arbitrary and unfriendly interference in Korea.\r\nTwice the efforts of the Japanese government to obtain redress for\r\nunlawful and ruinous commercial prohibitions had been thwarted by the\r\nChinese representative in Seoul; and an ultimatum addressed from Tokyo\r\nto the Korean government had elicited from the viceroy Li in Tientsin a\r\nthinly veiled threat of Chinese armed opposition. Still more provocative\r\nof national indignation was China's procedure with regard to the murder\r\nof Kim Ok-kyun, the leader of progress in Korea, who had been for some\r\nyears a refugee in Japan. Inveigled from Japan to China by a\r\nfellow-countryman sent from Seoul to assassinate him, Kim was shot in a\r\nJapanese hotel in Shanghai; and China, instead of punishing the\r\nmurderer, conveyed him in a war-ship of her own to Korea to be publicly\r\nhonoured. When, therefore, the Korean insurrection of 1894 induced the\r\nMin family again to solicit China's armed intervention, the Tokyo\r\ngovernment concluded that, in the interests of Japan's security and of\r\ncivilization in the Orient, steps must be taken to put an end to the\r\nmisrule which offered incessant invitations to foreign aggression, and\r\nchecked Korea's capacity to maintain its own independence. Japan did not\r\nclaim for herself any rights or interests in the peninsula superior to\r\nthose possessed there by China. But there was not the remotest\r\nprobability that China, whose face had been contemptuously set against\r\nall the progressive measures adopted by Japan during the preceding\r\ntwenty-five years, would join in forcing upon a neighbouring kingdom the\r\nvery reforms she herself despised, were her co-operation invited through\r\nordinary diplomatic channels only. It was necessary to contrive a\r\nsituation which would not only furnish clear proof of Japan's\r\nresolution, but also enable her to pursue her programme independently of\r\nChinese endorsement, should the latter be finally unobtainable. She\r\ntherefore met China's notice of a despatch of troops with a\r\ncorresponding notice of her own, and the month of July 1894 found a\r\nChinese force assembled at Asan and a Japanese force occupying positions\r\nin the neighbourhood of Seoul. China's motive for sending troops was\r\nnominally to quell the Tonghak insurrection, but really to re-affirm her\r\nown domination in the peninsula. Japan's motive was to secure such a\r\nposition as would enable her to insist upon the radically curative\r\ntreatment of Korea's malady. Up to this point the two empires were\r\nstrictly within their conventional rights. Each was entitled by treaty\r\nto send troops to Korea, provided that notice was given to the other.\r\nBut China, in giving notice, described Korea as her \"tributary state,\"\r\nthus thrusting into the forefront of the discussion a contention which\r\nJapan, from conciliatory motives, would have kept out of sight. Once\r\nformally advanced, however, the claim had to be challenged. In the\r\ntreaty of amity and commerce concluded in 1876 between Japan and Korea,\r\nthe two high contracting parties were explicitly declared to possess the\r\nsame national status. Japan could not agree that a power which for\r\nnearly two decades she had acknowledged and treated as her equal should\r\nbe openly classed as a tributary of China. She protested, but the\r\nChinese statesmen took no notice of her protest. They continued to apply\r\nthe disputed appellation to Korea, and they further asserted their\r\nassumption of sovereignty in the peninsula by seeking to set limits to\r\nthe number of troops sent by Japan, as well as to the sphere of their\r\nemployment. Japan then proposed that the two empires should unite their\r\nefforts for the suppression of disturbances in Korea, and for the\r\nsubsequent improvement of that kingdom's administration, the latter\r\npurpose to be pursued by the despatch of a joint commission of\r\ninvestigation. But China refused everything. Ready at all times to\r\ninterfere by force of arms between the Korean people and the dominant\r\npolitical faction, she declined to interfere in any way for the\r\npromotion of reform. She even expressed supercilious surprise that\r\nJapan, while asserting Korea's independence, should suggest the idea of\r\nperemptorily reforming its administration. In short, for Chinese\r\npurposes the Peking statesmen openly declared Korea a tributary state;\r\nbut for Japanese purposes they insisted that it must be held\r\nindependent. They believed that their island neighbour aimed at the\r\nabsorption of Korea into the Japanese empire. Viewed in the light of\r\nthat suspicion, China's attitude became comprehensible, but her\r\nprocedure was inconsistent, illogical and unpractical. The Tokyo cabinet\r\nnow declared its resolve not to withdraw the Japanese troops without\r\n\"some understanding that would guarantee the future peace, order, and\r\ngood government of Korea,\" and since China still declined to come to\r\nsuch an understanding, Japan undertook the work of reform single-handed.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Outbreak of Hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese representative in Seoul threw his whole weight into the\r\nscale against the success of these reforms. But the determining cause of\r\nrupture was in itself a belligerent operation. China's troops had been\r\nsent originally for the purpose of quelling the Tonghak rebellion. But\r\nthe rebellion having died of inanition before the landing of the troops,\r\ntheir services were not required. Nevertheless China kept them in Korea,\r\nher declared reason for doing so being the presence of a Japanese\r\nmilitary force. Throughout the subsequent negotiations the Chinese\r\nforces lay in an entrenched camp at Asan, while the Japanese occupied\r\nSeoul. An attempt on China's part to send reinforcements could be\r\nconstrued only as an unequivocal declaration of resolve to oppose\r\nJapan's proceedings by force of arms. Nevertheless China not only\r\ndespatched troops by sea to strengthen the camp at Asan, but also sent\r\nan army overland across Korea's northern frontier. At this stage an act\r\nof war occurred. Three Chinese men-of-war, convoying a transport with\r\n1200 men encountered and fired on three Japanese cruisers. One of the\r\nChinese ships was taken; another was so shattered that she had to be\r\nbeached and abandoned; the third escaped in a dilapidated condition; and\r\nthe transport, refusing to surrender, was sunk. This happened on the\r\n25th of July 1894, and an open declaration of war was made by each\r\nempire six days later.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Remote Origin of the Conflict.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment when Japan applied herself to break away from Oriental\r\ntraditions, and to remove from her limbs the fetters of Eastern\r\nconservatism, it was inevitable that a widening gulf should gradually\r\ngrow between herself and China. The war of 1894 was really a contest\r\nbetween Japanese progress and Chinese stagnation. To secure Korean\r\nimmunity from foreign--especially Russian--aggression was of capital\r\nimportance to both empires. Japan believed that such security could be\r\nattained by introducing into Korea the civilization which had\r\ncontributed so signally to the development of her own strength and\r\nresources. China thought that she could guarantee it without any\r\ndeparture from old-fashioned methods, and by the same process of\r\ncapricious protection which had failed so signally in the cases of\r\nAnnam, Tongking, Burma and Siam. The issue really at stake was whether\r\nJapan should be suffered to act as the Eastern propagandist of Western\r\nprogress, or whether her efforts in that cause should be held in check\r\nby Chinese conservatism.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Events of the War.\r\n\r\nThe war itself was a succession of triumphs for Japan. Four days after\r\nthe first naval encounter she sent from Seoul a column of troops who\r\nrouted the Chinese entrenched at Asan. Many of the fugitives effected\r\ntheir escape to Phyong-yang, a town on the Taidong River, offering\r\nexcellent facilities for defence, and historically interesting as the\r\nplace where a Japanese army of invasion had its first encounter with\r\nChinese troops in 1592. There the Chinese assembled a force of 17,000\r\nmen, and made leisurely preparations for a decisive contest. Forty days\r\nelapsed before the Japanese columns converged upon Phyong-yang, and that\r\ninterval was utilized by the Chinese to throw up parapets, mount Krupp\r\nguns and otherwise strengthen their position. Moreover, they were armed\r\nwith repeating rifles, whereas the Japanese had only single-loaders, and\r\nthe ground offered little cover for an attacking force. In such\r\ncircumstances, the advantages possessed by the defence ought to have\r\nbeen well-nigh insuperable; yet a day's fighting sufficed to carry all\r\nthe positions, the assailants' casualties amounting to less than 700 and\r\nthe defenders losing 6000 in killed and wounded. This brilliant victory\r\nwas the prelude to an equally conspicuous success at sea. For on the\r\n17th of September, the very day after the battle at Phyong-yang, a great\r\nnaval fight took place near the mouth of the Yalu River, which forms the\r\nnorthern boundary of Korea. Fourteen Chinese war-ships and six\r\ntorpedo-boats were returning to home ports after convoying a fleet of\r\ntransports to the Yalu, when they encountered eleven Japanese men-of-war\r\ncruising in the Yellow Sea. Hitherto the Chinese had sedulously avoided\r\na contest at sea. Their fleet included two armoured battleships of over\r\n7000 tons displacement, whereas the biggest vessels on the Japanese side\r\nwere belted cruisers of only 4000 tons. In the hands of an admiral\r\nappreciating the value of sea power, China's naval force would certainly\r\nhave been led against Japan's maritime communications, for a successful\r\nblow struck there must have put an end to the Korean campaign. The\r\nChinese, however, failed to read history. They employed their\r\nwar-vessels as convoys only, and, when not using them for that purpose,\r\nhid them in port. Everything goes to show that they would have avoided\r\nthe battle off the Yalu had choice been possible, though when forced to\r\nfight they fought bravely. Four of their ships were sunk, and the\r\nremainder escaped to Wei-hai-wei, the vigour of the Japanese pursuit\r\nbeing greatly impaired by the presence of torpedo-boats in the\r\nretreating squadron.\r\n\r\nThe Yalu victory opened the over-sea route to China. Japan could now\r\nstrike at Talien, Port Arthur, and Wei-hai-wei, naval stations on the\r\nLiaotung and Shantung peninsulas, where powerful permanent\r\nfortifications, built after plans prepared by European experts and armed\r\nwith the best modern weapons, were regarded as almost impregnable; They\r\nfell before the assaults of the Japanese troops as easily as the\r\ncomparatively rude fortifications at Phyong-yang had fallen. The only\r\nresistance of a stubborn character was made by the Chinese fleet at\r\nWei-hai-wei; but after the whole squadron of torpedo-craft had been\r\ndestroyed or captured as they attempted to escape, and after three of\r\nthe largest vessels had been sunk at their moorings by Japanese\r\ntorpedoes, and one by gun-fire, the remaining ships surrendered, and\r\ntheir brave commander, Admiral Ting, committed suicide. This ended the\r\nwar. It had lasted seven and a half months, during which time Japan put\r\ninto the field five columns, aggregating about 120,000 of all arms. One\r\nof these columns marched northward from Seoul, won the battle of\r\nPhyong-yang, advanced to the Yalu, forced its way into Manchuria, and\r\nmoved towards Mukden by Feng-hwang, fighting several minor engagements,\r\nand conducting the greater part of its operations amid deep snow in\r\nmidwinter. The second column diverged westwards from the Yalu, and,\r\nmarching through southern Manchuria, reached Hai-cheng, whence it\r\nadvanced to the capture of Niuchwang and Ying-tse-kow. The third landed\r\non the Liaotung peninsula, and, turning southwards, carried Talien and\r\nPort Arthur by assault. The fourth moved up the Liaotung peninsula, and,\r\nhaving seized Kaiping, advanced against Ying-tse-kow, where it joined\r\nhands with the second column. The fifth crossed from Port Arthur to\r\nWei-hai-wei, and captured the latter. In all these operations the total\r\nJapanese casualties were 1005 killed and 4922 wounded--figures which\r\nsufficiently indicate the inefficiency of the Chinese fighting. The\r\ndeaths from disease totalled 16,866, and the total monetary expenditure\r\nwas £20,000,000 sterling.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Conclusion of Peace.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese government sent Li Hung-chang, viceroy of Pechili and senior\r\ngrand secretary of state, and Li Ching-fong, to discuss terms of peace\r\nwith Japan, the latter being represented by Marquis (afterwards Prince)\r\nIto and Count Mutsu, prime minister and minister for foreign affairs,\r\nrespectively. A treaty was signed at Shimonoseki on the 17th of April\r\n1895, and subsequently ratified by the sovereigns of the two empires. It\r\ndeclared the absolute independence of Korea; ceded to Japan the part of\r\nManchuria lying south of a line drawn from the mouth of the river Anping\r\nto the mouth of the Liao, through Feng-hwang, Hai-cheng and\r\nYing-tse-kow, as well as the islands of Formosa and the Pescadores;\r\npledged China to pay an indemnity of 200,000,000 taels; provided for the\r\noccupation of Wei-hai-wei by Japan pending payment of the indemnity;\r\nsecured some additional commercial privileges, such as the opening of\r\nfour new places to foreign trade and the right of foreigners to engage\r\nin manufacturing enterprises in China, and provided for the conclusion\r\nof a treaty of commerce and amity between the two empires, based on the\r\nlines of China's treaties with Occidental powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Foreign Interference.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was this agreement ratified than Russia, Germany and France\r\npresented a joint note to the Tokyo government, recommending that the\r\nterritories ceded to Japan on the mainland of China should not be\r\npermanently occupied, as such a proceeding would be detrimental to\r\npeace. The recommendation was couched in the usual terms of diplomatic\r\ncourtesy, but everything indicated that its signatories were prepared to\r\nenforce their advice by an appeal to arms. Japan found herself compelled\r\nto comply. Exhausted by the Chinese campaign, which had drained her\r\ntreasury, consumed her supplies of warlike material, and kept her\r\nsquadrons constantly at sea for eight months, she had no residue of\r\nstrength to oppose such a coalition. Her resolve was quickly taken. The\r\nday that saw the publication of the ratified treaty saw also the issue\r\nof an Imperial rescript in which the mikado, avowing his unalterable\r\ndevotion to the cause of peace, and recognizing that the counsel offered\r\nby the European states was prompted by the same sentiment, \"yielded to\r\nthe dictates of magnanimity, and accepted the advice of the three\r\nPowers.\" The Japanese people were shocked by this incident. They could\r\nunderstand the motives influencing Russia and France, for it was\r\nevidently natural that the former should desire to exclude warlike and\r\nprogressive people like the Japanese from territories contiguous to her\r\nborders, and it was also natural that France should remain true to her\r\nalliance with Russia. But Germany, wholly uninterested in the ownership\r\nof Manchuria, and by profession a warm friend of Japan, seemed to have\r\njoined in robbing the latter of the fruits of her victory simply for the\r\nsake of establishing some shadowy title to Russia's goodwill. It was not\r\nknown until a later period that the German emperor entertained profound\r\napprehensions about the \"yellow peril,\" an irruption of Oriental hordes\r\ninto the Occident, and held it a sacred duty to prevent Japan from\r\ngaining a position which might enable her to construct an immense\r\nmilitary machine out of the countless millions of China.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chinese Crisis of 1900.\r\n\r\nJapan's third expedition over-sea in the Meiji era had its origin in\r\ncauses which belong to the history of China (q.v.). In the second half\r\nof 1900 an anti-foreign and anti-dynastic rebellion, breaking out in\r\nShantung, spread to the metropolitan province of Pechili, and resulted\r\nin a situation of extreme peril for the foreign communities of Tientsin\r\nand Peking. It was impossible for any European power, or for the United\r\nStates, to organize sufficiently prompt measures of relief. Thus the\r\neyes of the world turned to Japan, whose proximity to the scene of\r\ndisturbance rendered intervention comparatively easy for her. But Japan\r\nhesitated. Knowing now with what suspicion and distrust the development\r\nof her resources and the growth of her military strength were regarded\r\nby some European peoples, and aware that she had been admitted to the\r\ncomity of Western nations on sufferance, she shrank, on the one hand,\r\nfrom seeming to grasp at an opportunity for armed display, and, on the\r\nother, from the solecism of obtrusiveness in the society of strangers.\r\nNot until Europe and America made it quite plain that they needed and\r\ndesired her aid did she send a division (21,000) men to Pechili. Her\r\ntroops played a fine part in the subsequent expedition for the relief of\r\nPeking, which had to be approached in midsummer under very trying\r\nconditions. Fighting side by side with European and American soldiers,\r\nand under the eyes of competent military critics, the Japanese acquitted\r\nthemselves in such a manner as to establish a high military reputation.\r\nFurther, after the relief of Peking they withdrew a moiety of their\r\nforces, and that step, as well as their unequivocal co-operation with\r\nWestern powers in the subsequent negotiations, helped to show the\r\ninjustice of the suspicions with which they had been regarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n  War with Russia.\r\n\r\nFrom the time (1895) when Russia, with the co-operation of Germany and\r\nFrance, dictated to Japan a cardinal alteration of the Shimonoseki\r\ntreaty, Japanese statesmen seem to have concluded that their country\r\nmust one day cross swords with the great northern power. Not a few\r\nEuropean and American publicists shared that view. But the vast\r\nmajority, arguing that the little Eastern empire would never invite\r\nannihilation by such an encounter, believed that sufficient forbearance\r\nto avert serious trouble would always be forthcoming on Japan's side.\r\nYet when the geographical and historical situation was carefully\r\nconsidered, little hope of an ultimately peaceful settlement presented\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nJapan along its western shore, Korea along its southern and eastern, and\r\nRussia along the eastern coast of its maritime province, are washed by\r\nthe Sea of Japan. The communications between the sea and the Pacific\r\nOcean are practically two only. One is on the north-east, namely,\r\nTsugaru Strait; the other is on the south, namely, the channel between\r\nthe extremity of the Korean peninsula and the Japanese island of the\r\nnine provinces. Tsugaru Strait is entirely under Japan's control. It is\r\nbetween her main island and her island of Yezo, and in case of need she\r\ncan close it with mines. The channel between the southern extremity of\r\nKorea and Japan has a width of 102 m. and would therefore be a fine open\r\nsea-way were it free from islands. But almost mid-way in this channel\r\nlie the twin islands of Tsushima, and the space of 56 m. that separates\r\nthem from Japan is narrowed by another island, Iki. Tsushima and Iki\r\nbelong to the Japanese empire. The former has some exceptionally good\r\nharbours, constituting a naval base from which the channel on either\r\nside could easily be sealed. Thus the avenues from the Pacific Ocean to\r\nthe Sea of Japan are controlled by the Japanese empire. In other words,\r\naccess to the Pacific from Korea's eastern and southern coasts and\r\naccess to the Pacific from Russia's maritime province depend upon\r\nJapan's goodwill. So far as Korea was concerned this question mattered\r\nlittle, it being her fate to depend upon the goodwill of Japan in\r\naffairs of much greater importance. But with Russia the case was\r\ndifferent. Vladivostok, which until recent times was her principal port\r\nin the Far East, lies at the southern extremity of the maritime\r\nprovince; that is to say, on the north-western shore of the Japan Sea.\r\nIt was therefore necessary for Russia that freedom of passage by the\r\nTsushima channel should be secured, and to secure it one of two things\r\nwas essential, namely, either that she herself should possess a\r\nfortified port on the Korean side, or that Japan should be bound neither\r\nto acquire such a port nor to impose any restriction upon the navigation\r\nof the strait. To put the matter briefly, Russia must either acquire a\r\nstrong foothold for herself in southern Korea, or contrive that Japan\r\nshould not acquire one. There was here a strong inducement for Russian\r\naggression in Korea.\r\n\r\nRussia's eastward movement through Asia has been strikingly illustrative\r\nof her strong craving for free access to southern seas and of the\r\nimpediments she had experienced in gratifying that wish. An irresistible\r\nimpulse had driven her oceanward. Checked again and again in her attempts\r\nto reach the Mediterranean, she set out on a five-thousand-miles march of\r\nconquest right across the vast Asiatic continent towards the Pacific.\r\nEastward of Lake Baikal she found her line of least resistance along the\r\nAmur, and when, owing to the restless perseverance of Muravief, she\r\nreached the mouth of that great river, the acquisition of Nikolayevsk for\r\na naval basis was her immediate reward. But Nikolayevsk could not\r\npossibly satisfy her. Situated in an inhospitable region far away from\r\nall the main routes of the world's commerce, it offered itself only as a\r\nstepping-stone to further acquisitions. To push southward from this new\r\nport became an immediate object to Russia. There lay an obstacle in the\r\nway, however; the long strip of sea-coast from the mouth of the Amur to\r\nthe Korean frontier--an area then called the Usuri region because the\r\nUsuri forms its western boundary--belonged to China, and she, having\r\nconceded much to Russia in the matter of the Amur, showed no disposition\r\nto make further concessions in the matter of the Usuri. In the presence\r\nof menaces, however, she agreed that the region should be regarded as\r\ncommon property pending a convenient opportunity for clear delimitation.\r\nThat opportunity came very soon. Seizing the moment (1860) when China had\r\nbeen beaten to her knees by England and France, Russia secured final\r\ncession of the Usuri region, which now became the maritime province of\r\nSiberia. Then Russia shifted her naval base on the Pacific from\r\nNikolayevsk to Vladivostok. She gained ten degrees in a southerly\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nFrom the mouth of the Amur, where Nikolayevsk is situated, to the\r\nsouthern shore of Korea there rests on the coast of eastern Asia an arch\r\nof islands having at its northern point Sakhalin and at its southern\r\nTsushima, the keystone of the arch being the main island of Japan. This\r\narch embraces the Sea of Japan and is washed on its convex side by the\r\nPacific Ocean. Immediately after the transfer of Russia's naval base\r\nfrom Nikolayevsk to Vladivostok, an attempt was made to obtain\r\npossession of the southern point of the arch, namely, Tsushima. A\r\nRussian man-of-war proceeded thither and quietly began to establish a\r\nsettlement, which would soon have constituted a title of ownership had\r\nnot Great Britain interfered. The Russians saw that Vladivostok,\r\nacquired at the cost of so much toil, would be comparatively useless\r\nunless from the sea on whose shore it was situated an avenue to the\r\nPacific could be opened, and they therefore tried to obtain command of\r\nthe Tsushima channel. Immediately after reaching the mouth of the Amur\r\nthe same instinct had led them to begin the colonization of Sakhalin.\r\nThe axis of this long narrow island is inclined at a very acute angle to\r\nthe Usuri region, which its northern extremity almost touches, while its\r\nsouthern is separated from Yezo by the strait of La Pérouse. But in\r\nSakhalin the Russians found Japanese subjects. In fact the island was a\r\npart of the Japanese empire. Resorting, however, to the Usuri fiction of\r\njoint occupation, they succeeded by 1875 in transferring the whole of\r\nSakhalin to Russia's dominion. Further encroachments upon Japanese\r\nterritory could not be lightly essayed, and the Russians held their\r\nhands. They had been trebly checked: checked in trying to push southward\r\nalong the coast of the mainland; checked in trying to secure an avenue\r\nfrom Vladivostok to the Pacific; and checked in their search for an\r\nice-free port, which definition Vladivostok did not fulfil. Enterprise\r\nin the direction of Korea seemed to be the only hope of saving the\r\nmaritime results of the great Trans-Asian march.\r\n\r\nWas Korea within safe range of such enterprises? Everything seemed to\r\nanswer in the affirmative. Korea had all the qualifications desired by\r\nan aggressor. Her people were unprogressive, her resources undeveloped,\r\nher self-defensive capacities insignificant, her government corrupt. But\r\nshe was a tributary of China, and China had begun to show some tenacity\r\nin protecting the integrity of her buffer states. Besides, Japan was\r\nunderstood to have pretensions with regard to Korea. On the whole,\r\ntherefore, the problem of carrying to full fruition the work of Muravief\r\nand his lieutenants demanded strength greater than Russia could exercise\r\nwithout some line of communications supplementing the Amur waterway and\r\nthe long ocean route. Therefore she set about the construction of a\r\nrailway across Asia.\r\n\r\nThe Amur being the boundary of Russia's east Asian territory, this\r\nrailway had to be carried along its northern bank where many\r\nengineering and economic obstacles presented themselves. Besides, the\r\nriver, from an early stage in its course, makes a huge semicircular\r\nsweep northward, and a railway following its bank to Vladivostok must\r\nmake the same détour. If, on the contrary, the road could be carried\r\nover the diameter of the semicircle, it would be a straight and\r\ntherefore shorter line, technically easier and economically better. The\r\ndiameter, however, passed through Chinese territory, and an excuse for\r\nextorting China's permission was not in sight. Russia therefore\r\nproceeded to build each end of the road, deferring the construction of\r\nthe Amur section for the moment. She had not waited long when, in 1894,\r\nwar broke out between China and Japan, and the latter, completely\r\nvictorious, demanded as the price of peace the southern littoral of\r\nManchuria from the Korean boundary to the Liaotung peninsula at the\r\nentrance to the Gulf of Pechili. This was a crisis in Russia's career.\r\nShe saw that her maritime extension could never get nearer to the\r\nPacific than Vladivostok were this claim of Japan's established. For the\r\nproposed arrangement would place the littoral of Manchuria in Japan's\r\ndirect occupation and the littoral of Korea in her constructive control,\r\nsince not only had she fought to rescue Korea from Chinese suzerainty,\r\nbut also her object in demanding a slice of the Manchurian coast-line\r\nwas to protect Korea against aggression from the north; that is to say,\r\nagainst aggression from Russia. Muravief's enterprise had carried his\r\ncountry first to the mouth of the Amur and thence southward along the\r\ncoast to Vladivostok and to Possiet Bay at the north-eastern extremity\r\nof Korea. But it had not given to Russia free access to the Pacific, and\r\nnow she was menaced with a perpetual barrier to that access, since the\r\nwhole remaining coast of east Asia as far as the Gulf of Pechili was\r\nabout to pass into Japan's possession or under her domination.\r\n\r\nThen Russia took an extraordinary step. She persuaded Germany and France\r\nto force Japan out of Manchuria. It is not to be supposed that she\r\nfrankly exposed her own aggressive designs and asked for assistance to\r\nprosecute them. Neither is it to be supposed that France and Germany\r\nwere so curiously deficient in perspicacity as to overlook those\r\ndesigns. At all events these three great powers served on Japan a notice\r\nto quit, and Japan, exhausted by her struggle with China, had no choice\r\nbut to obey.\r\n\r\nThe notice was accompanied by an _exposé_ of reasons. Its signatories\r\nsaid that Japan's tenure of the Manchurian littoral would menace the\r\nsecurity of the Chinese capital, would render the independence of Korea\r\nillusory, and would constitute an obstacle to the peace of the Orient.\r\n\r\nBy way of saving the situation in some slight degree Japan sought from\r\nChina a guarantee that no portion of Manchuria should thereafter be\r\nleased or ceded to a foreign state. But France warned Japan that to\r\npress such a demand would offend Russia, and Russia declared that, for\r\nher part, she had no intention of trespassing in Manchuria. Japan, had\r\nshe been in a position to insist on the guarantee, would also have been\r\nin a position to disobey the mandate of the three powers. Unable to do\r\neither the one or the other, she quietly stepped out of Manchuria, and\r\nproceeded to double her army and treble her navy.\r\n\r\nAs a reward for the assistance nominally rendered to China in this\r\nmatter, Russia obtained permission in Peking to divert her Trans-Asian\r\nrailway from the huge bend of the Amur to the straight line through\r\nManchuria. Neither Germany nor France received any immediate recompense.\r\nThree years later, by way of indemnity for the murder of two\r\nmissionaries by a mob, Germany seized a portion of the province of\r\nShantung. Immediately, on the principle that two wrongs make a right,\r\nRussia obtained a lease of the Liaotung peninsula, from which she had\r\ndriven Japan in 1895. This act she followed by extorting from China\r\npermission to construct a branch of the Trans-Asian railway through\r\nManchuria from north to south.\r\n\r\nRussia's maritime aspirations had now assumed a radically altered phase.\r\nInstead of pushing southward from Vladivostok and Possiet Bay along the\r\ncoast of Korea, she had suddenly leaped the Korean peninsula and found\r\naccess to the Pacific in Liaotung. Nothing was wanting to establish her\r\nas practical mistress of Manchuria except a plausible excuse for\r\ngarrisoning the place. Such an excuse was furnished by the Boxer rising\r\nin 1900. Its conclusion saw her in military occupation of the whole\r\nregion, and she might easily have made her occupation permanent by\r\nprolonging it until peace and order should have been fully restored. But\r\nhere she fell into an error of judgment. Imagining that the Chinese\r\ncould be persuaded or intimidated to any concession, she proposed a\r\nconvention virtually recognizing her title to Manchuria.\r\n\r\nJapan watched all these things with profound anxiety. If there were any\r\nreality in the dangers which Russia, Germany and France had declared to\r\nbe incidental to Japanese occupation of a part of Manchuria, the same\r\ndangers must be doubly incidental to Russian occupation of the whole of\r\nManchuria--the security of the Chinese capital would be threatened, and\r\nan obstacle would be created to the permanent peace of the East. The\r\nindependence of Korea was an object of supreme solicitude to Japan.\r\nHistorically she held towards the little state a relation closely\r\nresembling that of suzerain, and though of her ancient conquests nothing\r\nremained except a settlement at Fusan on the southern coast, her\r\nnational sentiment would have been deeply wounded by any foreign\r\naggression in the peninsula. It was to establish Korean independence\r\nthat she waged war with China in 1894; and her annexation of the\r\nManchurian littoral adjacent to the Korean frontier, after the war, was\r\ndesigned to secure that independence, not to menace it as the triple\r\nalliance professed to think. But if Russia came into possession of all\r\nManchuria, her subsequent absorption of Korea would be almost\r\ninevitable. For the consideration set forth above as to Vladivostok's\r\nmaritime avenues would then acquire absolute cogency. Manchuria is\r\nlarger than France and the United Kingdom lumped together. The addition\r\nof such an immense area to Russia's east Asiatic dominions, together\r\nwith its littoral on the Gulf of Pechili and the Yellow Sea, would\r\nnecessitate a corresponding expansion of her naval forces in the Far\r\nEast. With the one exception of Port Arthur, however, the Manchurian\r\ncoast does not offer any convenient naval base. It is only in the\r\nsplendid harbours of southern Korea that such bases can be found.\r\nMoreover, there would be an even stronger motive impelling Russia\r\ntowards Korea. Neither the Usuri region nor the Manchurian littoral\r\npossesses so much as one port qualified to satisfy her perennial longing\r\nfor free access to the ocean in a temperate zone. Without Korea, then,\r\nRussia's east Asian expansion, though it added huge blocks of territory\r\nto her dominions, would have been commercially incomplete and\r\nstrategically defective.\r\n\r\nIf it be asked why, apart from history and national sentiment, Japan\r\nshould object to a Russian Korea, the answer is, first, because there\r\nwould thus be planted almost within cannon-shot of her shores a power of\r\nenormous strength and insatiable ambition; secondly, because, whatever\r\nvoice in Manchuria's destiny Russia derived from her railway, the same\r\nvoice in Korea's destiny was possessed by Japan as the sole owner of\r\nrailways in the peninsula; thirdly, that whereas Russia had an\r\naltogether insignificant share in the foreign commerce of Korea and\r\nscarcely ten bona-fide settlers, Japan did the greater part of the\r\nover-sea trade and had tens of thousands of settlers; fourthly, that if\r\nRussia's dominions stretched uninterruptedly from the Sea of Okhotsk to\r\nthe Gulf of Pechili, her ultimate absorption of north China would be as\r\ncertain as sunrise; and fifthly, that such domination and such\r\nabsorption would involve the practical closure of all that immense\r\nregion to Japanese commerce and industry as well as to the commerce and\r\nindustry of every Western nation except Russia. This last proposition\r\ndid not rest solely on the fact that to oppose artificial barriers to\r\nfree competition is Russia's sole hope of utilizing to her own benefit\r\nany commercial opportunities brought within her reach. It rested also on\r\nthe fact that Russia had objected to foreign settlements at the marts\r\nrecently opened by treaty with China to American and Japanese subjects.\r\nWithout settlements, trade at those marts would be impossible, and thus\r\nRussia had constructively announced that there should be no trade but\r\nRussian, if she could prevent it.\r\n\r\nAgainst such dangers Japan would have been justified in adopting any\r\nmeasure of self-protection. She had foreseen them for six years, and had\r\nbeen strengthening herself to avert them. But she wanted peace. She\r\nwanted to develop her material resources and to accumulate some measure\r\nof wealth, without which she must remain insignificant among the\r\nnations. Two pacific devices offered, and she adopted them both. Russia,\r\ninstead of trusting time to consolidate her tenure of Manchuria, had\r\nmade the mistake of pragmatically importuning China for a conventional\r\ntitle. If then Peking could be strengthened to resist this demand, some\r\narrangement of a distinctly terminable nature might be made. The United\r\nStates, Great Britain and Japan, joining hands for that purpose, did\r\nsucceed in so far stiffening China's backbone that her show of\r\nresolution finally induced Russia to sign a treaty pledging herself to\r\nwithdraw her troops from Manchuria in three instalments, each step of\r\nevacuation to be accomplished by a fixed date. That was one of the\r\npacific devices. The other suggested itself in connexion with the new\r\ncommercial treaties which China had promised to negotiate in the sequel\r\nof the Boxer troubles. In these documents clauses provided for the\r\nopening of three places in Manchuria to foreign trade. It seemed a\r\nreasonable hope that, having secured commercial access to Manchuria by\r\ncovenant with its sovereign, China, the powers would not allow Russia\r\narbitrarily to restrict their privileges. It seemed also a reasonable\r\nhope that Russia, having solemnly promised to evacuate Manchuria at\r\nfixed dates, would fulfil her engagement.\r\n\r\nThe latter hope was signally disappointed. When the time came for\r\nevacuation, Russia behaved as though no promise had ever been given. She\r\nproposed wholly new conditions, which would have strengthened her grasp\r\nof Manchuria instead of loosening it. China being powerless to offer any\r\npractical protest, and Japan's interests ranking next in order of\r\nimportance, the Tokyo government approached Russia direct. They did not\r\nask for anything that could hurt her pride or injure her position.\r\nAppreciating fully the economical status she had acquired in Manchuria\r\nby large outlays of capital, they offered to recognize that status,\r\nprovided that Russia would extend similar recognition to Japan's status\r\nin Korea, would promise, in common with Japan, to respect the\r\nsovereignty and the territorial integrity of China and Korea, and would\r\nbe a party to a mutual engagement that all nations should have equal\r\nindustrial and commercial opportunities in Manchuria and the Korean\r\npeninsula. In a word, they invited Russia to subscribe the policy\r\nenunciated by the United States and Great Britain, the policy of the\r\nopen door and of the integrity of the Chinese and Korean empires.\r\n\r\nThus commenced a negotiation which lasted five and a half months. Japan\r\ngradually reduced her demands to a minimum. Russia never made the\r\nsmallest appreciable concession. She refused to listen to Japan for one\r\nmoment about Manchuria. Eight years previously Japan had been in\r\nmilitary possession of Manchuria, and Russia with the assistance of\r\nGermany and France had expelled her for reasons which concerned Japan\r\nincomparably more than they concerned any of the three powers--the\r\nsecurity of the Chinese capital, the independence of Korea, the peace of\r\nthe East. Now, Russia had the splendid assurance to declare by\r\nimplication that none of these things concerned Japan at all. The utmost\r\nshe would admit was Japan's partial right to be heard about Korea. And\r\nat the same time she herself commenced in northern Korea a series of\r\naggressions, partly perhaps to show her potentialities, partly by way of\r\ncounter-irritant. That was not all. Whilst she studiously deferred her\r\nanswers to Japan's proposals and protracted the negotiations to an\r\nextent which was actually contumelious, she hastened to send eastward a\r\nbig fleet of war-ships and a new army of soldiers. It was impossible for\r\nthe dullest politician to mistake her purpose. She intended to yield\r\nnothing, but to prepare such a parade of force that her obduracy would\r\ncommand submission. The only alternatives for Japan were war or total\r\nand permanent effacement in Asia. She chose war, and in fighting it she\r\nfought the battle of free and equal opportunities for all without undue\r\nencroachment upon the sovereign rights or territorial integrity of China\r\nor Korea, against a military dictatorship, a programme of ruthless\r\nterritorial aggrandizement and a policy of selfish restrictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Results of the War.\r\n\r\nThe details of the great struggle that ensued are given elsewhere (see\r\nRUSSO-JAPANESE WAR). After the battle of Mukden the belligerents found\r\nthemselves in a position which must either prelude another stupendous\r\neffort on both sides or be utilized for the purpose of peace\r\nnegotiations. At this point the president of the United States of\r\nAmerica intervened in the interests of humanity, and on the 9th of June\r\n1905 instructed the United States' representative in Tokyo to urge that\r\nthe Japanese government should open direct negotiations with Russia, an\r\nexactly corresponding note being simultaneously sent to the Russian\r\ngovernment through the United States' representative in St Petersburg.\r\nJapan's reply was made on the 10th of June. It intimated frank\r\nacquiescence, and Russia lost no time in taking a similar step.\r\nNevertheless two months elapsed before the plenipotentiaries of the\r\nbelligerents met, on the 10th of August, at Portsmouth, New Hampshire,\r\nU.S.A. Russia sent M. (afterwards Count) de Witte and Baron Rosen;\r\nJapan, Baron (afterwards Count) Komura, who had held the portfolio of\r\nforeign affairs throughout the war, and Mr. (afterwards Baron) Takahira.\r\nIn entering this conference, Japanese statesmen, as was subsequently\r\nknown, saw clearly that a great part of the credit accruing to them for\r\ntheir successful conduct of the war would be forfeited in the sequel of\r\nthe negotiations. For the people of Japan had accustomed themselves to\r\nexpect that Russia would assuredly recoup the expenses incurred by their\r\ncountry in the contest, whereas the cabinet in Tokyo understood well\r\nthat to look for payment of indemnity by a great state whose territory\r\nhad not been invaded effectively nor its existence menaced must be\r\nfutile. Nevertheless, diplomacy required that this conviction should be\r\nconcealed, and thus Russia carried to the conference a belief that the\r\nfinancial phase of the discussion would be crucial, while, at the same\r\ntime, the Japanese nation reckoned fully on an indemnity of 150 millions\r\nsterling. Baron Komura's mandate was, however, that the only radically\r\nessential terms were those formulated by Japan prior to the war. She\r\nmust insist on securing the ends for which she had fought, since she\r\nbelieved them to be indispensable to the peace of the Far East, but she\r\nwould not demand anything more. The Japanese plenipotentiary, therefore,\r\njudged it wise to marshal his terms in the order of their importance,\r\nleaving his Russian colleague to imagine, as he probably would, that the\r\nconverse method had been adopted, and that everything preliminary to the\r\nquestions of finance and territory was of minor consequence. The\r\nnegotiations, commencing on the 10th of August, were not concluded until\r\nthe 5th of September, when a treaty of peace was signed. There had been\r\na moment when the onlooking world believed that unless Russia agreed to\r\nransom the island of Sakhalin by paying to Japan a sum of 120 millions\r\nsterling, the conference would be broken off; nor did such an exchange\r\nseem unreasonable, for were Russia expelled from the northern part of\r\nSakhalin, which commands the estuary of the Amur River, her position in\r\nSiberia would have been compromised. But the statesmen who directed\r\nJapan's affairs were not disposed to make any display of earth-hunger.\r\nThe southern half of Sakhalin had originally belonged to Japan and had\r\npassed into Russia's possession by an arrangement which the Japanese\r\nnation strongly resented. To recover that portion of the island seemed,\r\ntherefore, a legitimate ambition. Japan did not contemplate any larger\r\ndemand, nor did she seriously insist on an indemnity. Therefore the\r\nnegotiations were never in real danger of failure. The treaty of\r\nPortsmouth recognized Japan's \"paramount political, military and\r\neconomic interests\" in Korea; provided for the simultaneous evacuation\r\nof Manchuria by the contracting parties; transferred to Japan the lease\r\nof the Liaotung peninsula held by Russia from China together with the\r\nRussian railways south of Kwang-Cheng-tsze and all collateral mining or\r\nother privileges; ceded to Japan the southern half of Sakhalin, the 50th\r\nparallel of latitude to be the boundary between the two parts; secured\r\nfishing rights for Japanese subjects along the coasts of the seas of\r\nJapan, Okhotsk and Bering; laid down that the expenses incurred by the\r\nJapanese for the maintenance of the Russian prisoners during the war\r\nshould be reimbursed by Russia, less the outlays made by the latter on\r\naccount of Japanese prisoners--by which arrangement Japan obtained a\r\npayment of some 4 millions sterling--and provided that the contracting\r\nparties, while withdrawing their military forces from Manchuria, might\r\nmaintain guards to protect their respective railways, the number of such\r\nguards not to exceed 15 per kilometre of line. There were other\r\nimportant restrictions: first, the contracting parties were to abstain\r\nfrom taking, on the Russo-Korean frontier, any military measures which\r\nmight menace the security of Russian or Korean territory; secondly, the\r\ntwo powers pledged themselves not to exploit the Manchurian railways for\r\nstrategic purposes; and thirdly, they promised not to build on Sakhalin\r\nor its adjacent islands any fortifications or other similar military\r\nworks, or to take any military measures which might impede the free\r\nnavigation of the straits of La Pérouse and the Gulf of Tartary. The\r\nabove provisions concerned the two contracting parties only. But China's\r\ninterests also were considered. Thus it was agreed to \"restore entirely\r\nand completely to her exclusive administration\" all portions of\r\nManchuria then in the occupation, or under the control, of Japanese or\r\nRussian troops, except the leased territory; that her consent must be\r\nobtained for the transfer to Japan of the leases and concessions held by\r\nthe Russians in Manchuria; that the Russian government would disavow the\r\npossession of \"any territorial advantages or preferential or exclusive\r\nconcessions in impairment of Chinese sovereignty or inconsistent with\r\nthe principle of equal opportunity in Manchuria\"; and that Japan and\r\nRussia \"engaged reciprocally not to obstruct any general measures common\r\nto all countries which China might take for the development of the\r\ncommerce and industry of Manchuria.\" This distinction between the\r\nspecial interests of the contracting parties and the interests of China\r\nherself as well as of foreign nations generally is essential to clear\r\nunderstanding of a situation which subsequently attracted much\r\nattention. From the time of the opium war (1857) to the Boxer rising\r\n(1900) each of the great Western powers struggled for its own hand in\r\nChina, and each sought to gain for itself exclusive concessions and\r\nprivileges with comparatively little regard for the interests of others,\r\nand with no regard whatever for China's sovereign rights. The fruits of\r\nthis period were: permanently ceded territories (Hong-Kong and Macao);\r\nleases temporarily establishing foreign sovereignty in various districts\r\n(Kiaochow, Wei-hai-wei and Kwang-chow); railway and mining concessions;\r\nand the establishment of settlements at open ports where foreign\r\njurisdiction was supreme. But when, in 1900, the Boxer rising forced all\r\nthe powers into a common camp, they awoke to full appreciation of a\r\nprinciple which had been growing current for the past two or three\r\nyears, namely, that concerted action on the lines of maintaining China's\r\nintegrity and securing to all alike equality of opportunity and a\r\nsimilarly open door, was the only feasible method of preventing the\r\npartition of the Chinese Empire and averting a clash of rival interests\r\nwhich might have disastrous results. This, of course, did not mean that\r\nthere was to be any abandonment of special privileges already acquired\r\nor any surrender of existing concessions. The arrangement was not to be\r\nretrospective in any sense. Vested interests were to be strictly guarded\r\nuntil the lapse of the periods for which they had been granted, or until\r\nthe maturity of China's competence to be really autonomous. A curious\r\nsituation was thus created. International professions of respect for\r\nChina's sovereignty, for the integrity of her empire and for the\r\nenforcement of the open door and equal opportunity, coexisted with\r\nlegacies from an entirely different past. Russia endorsed this new\r\npolicy, but not unnaturally declined to abate any of the advantages\r\npreviously enjoyed by her in Manchuria. Those advantages were very\r\nsubstantial. They included a twenty-five years' lease--with provision\r\nfor renewal--of the Liaotung peninsula, within which area of 1220 sq. m.\r\nChinese troops might not penetrate, whereas Russia would not only\r\nexercise full administrative authority, but also take military and naval\r\naction of any kind; they included the creation of a neutral territory in\r\nthe immediate north of the former and still more extensive, which should\r\nremain under Chinese administration, but where neither Chinese nor\r\nRussian troops might enter, nor might China, without Russia's consent,\r\ncede land, open trading marts or grant concessions to any third\r\nnationality; and they included the right to build some 1600 m. of\r\nrailway (which China would have the opportunity of purchasing at cost\r\nprice in the year 1938 and would be entitled to receive gratis in 1982),\r\nas well as the right to hold extensive zones on either side of the\r\nrailway, to administer these zones in the fullest sense, and to work all\r\nmines lying along the lines. Under the Portsmouth treaty these\r\nadvantages were transferred to Japan by Russia, the railway, however,\r\nbeing divided so that only the portion (521½ m.) to the south of\r\nKwang-Cheng-tsze fell to Japan's share, while the portion (1077 m.) to\r\nthe north of that place remained in Russia's hands. China's consent to\r\nthe above transfers and assignments was obtained in a treaty signed at\r\nPeking on the 22nd of December 1905. Thus Japan came to hold in\r\nManchuria a position somewhat contradictory. On the one hand, she\r\nfigured as the champion of the Chinese Empire's integrity and as an\r\nexponent of the new principle of equal opportunity and the open door. On\r\nthe other, she appeared as the legatee of many privileges more or less\r\ninconsistent with that principle. But, at the same time, nearly all the\r\ngreat powers of Europe were similarly circumstanced. In their cases also\r\nthe same incongruity was observable between the newly professed policy\r\nand the aftermath of the old practice. It was scarcely to be expected\r\nthat Japan alone should make a large sacrifice on the altar of a theory\r\nto which no other state thought of yielding any retrospective obedience\r\nwhatever. She did, indeed, furnish a clear proof of deference to the\r\nopen-door doctrine, for instead of reserving the railway zones to her\r\nown exclusive use, as she was fully entitled to do, she sought and\r\nobtained from China a pledge to open to foreign trade 16 places within\r\nthose zones. For the rest, however, the inconsistency between the past\r\nand the present, though existing throughout the whole of China, was\r\nnowhere so conspicuous as in the three eastern provinces (Manchuria);\r\nnot because there was any real difference of degree, but because\r\nManchuria had been the scene of the greatest war of modern times;\r\nbecause that war had been fought by Japan in the cause of the new\r\npolicy, and because the principles of the equally open door and of\r\nChina's integrity had been the main bases of the Portsmouth treaty, of\r\nthe Anglo-Japanese alliance, and of the subsequently concluded\r\n_ententes_ with France and Russia. In short, the world's eyes were fixed\r\non Manchuria and diverted from China proper, so that every act of Japan\r\nwas subjected to an exceptionally rigorous scrutiny, and the nations\r\nbehaved as though they expected her to live up to a standard of almost\r\nideal altitude. China's mood, too, greatly complicated the situation.\r\nShe had the choice between two moderate and natural courses: either to\r\nwait quietly until the various concessions granted by her to foreign\r\npowers in the evil past should lapse by maturity, or to qualify herself\r\nby earnest reforms and industrious development for their earlier\r\nrecovery. Nominally she adopted the latter course, but in reality she\r\nfell into a mood of much impatience. Under the name of a\r\n\"rights-recovery campaign\" her people began to protest vehemently\r\nagainst the continuance of any conditions which impaired her\r\nsovereignty, and as this temper coloured her attitude towards the\r\nvarious questions which inevitably grew out of the situation in\r\nManchuria, her relations with Japan became somewhat strained in the\r\nearly part of 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Japan in Korea after the War with Russia.\r\n\r\nHaving waged two wars on account of Korea, Japan emerged from the second\r\nconflict with the conviction that the policy of maintaining the\r\nindependence of Korea must be modified, and that since the identity of\r\nKorean and Japanese interests in the Far East and the paramount\r\ncharacter of Japanese interests in Korea would not permit Japan to leave\r\nKorea to the care of any third power, she must assume the charge\r\nherself. Europe and America also recognized that view of the situation,\r\nand consented to withdraw their legations from Seoul, thus leaving the\r\ncontrol of Korean foreign affairs entirely in the hands of Japan, who\r\nfurther undertook to assume military direction in the event of\r\naggression from without or disturbance from within. But in the matter of\r\ninternal administration she continued to limit herself to advisory\r\nsupervision. Thus, though a Japanese resident-general in Seoul, with\r\nsubordinate residents throughout the provinces, assumed the functions\r\nhitherto discharged by foreign representatives and consuls, the Korean\r\ngovernment was merely asked to employ Japanese experts in the position\r\nof counsellors, the right to accept or reject their counsels being left\r\nto their employers. Once again, however, the futility of looking for any\r\nreal reforms under this optional system was demonstrated. Japan sent her\r\nmost renowned statesman, Prince Ito, to discharge the duties of\r\nresident-general; but even he, in spite of profound patience and tact,\r\nfound that some less optional methods must be resorted to. Hence on the\r\n24th of July 1907 a new agreement was signed, by which the\r\nresident-general acquired initiative as well as consultative competence\r\nto enact and enforce laws and ordinances, to appoint and remove Korean\r\nofficials, and to place capable Japanese subjects in the ranks of the\r\nadministration. That this constituted a heavy blow to Korea's\r\nindependence could not be gainsaid. That it was inevitable seemed to be\r\nequally obvious. For there existed in Korea nearly all the worst abuses\r\nof medieval systems. The administration of justice depended solely on\r\nfavour or interest. The police contributed by corruption and\r\nincompetence to the insecurity of life and property. The troops were a\r\nbody of useless mercenaries. Offices being allotted by sale, thousands\r\nof incapables thronged the ranks of the executive. The emperor's court\r\nwas crowded by diviners and plotters of all kinds, male and female. The\r\nfinances of the throne and those of the state were hopelessly confused.\r\nThere was nothing like an organized judiciary. A witness was in many\r\ncases considered _particeps criminis_; torture was commonly employed to\r\nobtain evidence, and defendants in civil cases were placed under arrest.\r\nImprisonment meant death or permanent disablement for a man of small\r\nmeans. Flogging so severe as to cripple, if not to kill, was a common\r\npunishment; every major offence from robbery upward was capital, and\r\nfemale criminals were frequently executed by administering shockingly\r\npainful poisons. The currency was in a state of the utmost confusion.\r\nExtreme corruption and extortion were practised in connexion with\r\ntaxation. Finally, while nothing showed that the average Korean lacked\r\nthe elementary virtue of patriotism, there had been repeated proofs that\r\nthe safety and independence of the empire counted for little in the\r\nestimates of political intriguers. Japan must either step out of Korea\r\naltogether or effect drastic reforms there. She necessarily chose the\r\nlatter alternative, and the things which she accomplished between the\r\nbeginning of 1906 and the close of 1908 may be briefly described as the\r\nelaboration of a proper system of taxation; the organization of a staff\r\nto administer annual budgets; the re-assessment of taxable property; the\r\nfloating of public loans for productive enterprises; the reform of the\r\ncurrency; the establishment of banks of various kinds, including\r\nagricultural and commercial; the creation of associations for putting\r\nbank-notes into circulation; the introduction of a warehousing system to\r\nsupply capital to farmers; the lighting and buoying of the coasts; the\r\nprovision of posts, telegraphs, roads and railways; the erection of\r\npublic buildings; the starting of various industrial enterprises (such\r\nas printing, brick-making, forestry and coal-mining); the laying out of\r\nmodel farms; the beginning of cotton cultivation; the building and\r\nequipping of an industrial training school; the inauguration of sanitary\r\nworks; the opening of hospitals and medical schools; the organization of\r\nan excellent educational system; the construction of waterworks in\r\nseveral towns; the complete remodelling of the central government; the\r\ndifferentiation of the court and the executive, as well as of the\r\nadministration and the judiciary; the formation of an efficient body of\r\npolice; the organization of law courts with a majority of Japanese\r\njurists on the bench; the enactment of a new penal code; drastic reforms\r\nin the taxation system. In the summer of 1907 the resident-general\r\nadvised the Throne to disband the standing army as an unserviceable and\r\nexpensive force. The measure was doubtless desirable, but the docility\r\nof the troops had been over-rated. Some of them resisted vehemently, and\r\nmany became the nucleus of an insurrection which lasted in a desultory\r\nmanner for nearly two years; cost the lives of 21,000 insurgents and\r\n1300 Japanese; and entailed upon Japan an outlay of nearly a million\r\nsterling. Altogether Japan was 15 millions sterling out of pocket on\r\nKorea's account by the end of 1909. She had also lost the veteran\r\nstatesman Prince Ito, who was assassinated at Harbin by a Korean fanatic\r\non the 26th of October 1909. Finally an end was put to an anomalous\r\nsituation by the annexation of Korea to Japan on the 29th of August\r\n1910. (See further KOREA.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.--DOMESTIC HISTORY\r\n\r\n_Cosmography._--Japanese annals represent the first inhabitant of earth\r\nas a direct descendant of the gods. Two books describe the events of the\r\n\"Divine age.\" One, compiled in 712, is called the _Kojiki (Records of\r\nAncient Matters)_; the other, compiled in 720, is called the _Nihongi\r\n(Chronicles of Japan)_. Both describe the processes of creation, but the\r\nauthor of the _Chronicles_ drew largely upon Chinese traditions, whereas\r\nthe compilers of the _Records_ appear to have limited themselves to\r\nmaterials which they believed to be native. The _Records_, therefore,\r\nhave always been regarded as the more trustworthy guide to pure Japanese\r\nconceptions. They deal with the creation of Japan only, other countries\r\nhaving been apparently judged unworthy of attention. At the beginning of\r\nall things a primordial trinity is represented as existing on the \"plain\r\nof high heaven.\" Thereafter, during an indefinite time and by an\r\nindefinite process, other deities come into existence, their titles\r\nindicating a vague connexion with constructive and fertilizing forces.\r\nThey are not immortal: it is explicitly stated that they ultimately pass\r\naway, and the idea of the cosmographers seems to be that each deity\r\nmarks a gradual approach to human methods of procreation. Meanwhile the\r\nearth is \"young and, like floating oil, drifts about after the manner of\r\na jelly-fish.\" At last there are born two deities, the creator and the\r\ncreatress, and these receive the mandate of all the heavenly beings to\r\n\"make, consolidate and give birth to the drifting land.\" For use in that\r\nwork a jewelled spear is given to them, and, standing upon the bridge\r\nthat connects heaven and earth, they thrust downwards with the weapon,\r\nstir the brine below and draw up the spear, when from its point fall\r\ndrops which, accumulating, form the first dry land. Upon this land the\r\ntwo deities descend, and, by ordinary processes, beget the islands of\r\nJapan as well as numerous gods representing the forces of nature. But in\r\ngiving birth to the god of fire the creatress (Izanami) perishes, and\r\nthe creator (Izanagi) makes his way to the under-world in search of\r\nher--an obvious parallel to the tales of Ishtar and Orpheus. With\r\ndifficulty he returns to earth, and, as he washes himself from the\r\npollution of Hades, there are born from the turbid water a number of\r\nevil deities succeeded by a number of good, just as in the Babylonian\r\ncosmogony the primordial ocean, Tiamat, brings forth simultaneously gods\r\nand imps. Finally, as Izanagi washes his left eye the Goddess of the Sun\r\ncomes into existence; as he washes his right, the God of the Moon; and\r\nas he washes his nose, the God of Force. To these three he assigns,\r\nrespectively, the dominion of the sun, the dominion of the moon, and the\r\ndominion of the ocean. But the god of force (Sosanoo), like Lucifer,\r\nrebels against this decree, creates a commotion in heaven, and after\r\nhaving been the cause of the temporary seclusion of the sun goddess and\r\nthe consequent wrapping of the world in darkness, kills the goddess of\r\nfood and is permanently banished from heaven by the host of deities. He\r\ndescends to Izumo on the west of the main island of Japan, and there\r\nsaves a maiden from an eight-headed serpent. Sosanoo himself passes to\r\nthe under-world and becomes the deity of Hades, but he invests one of\r\nhis descendants with the sovereignty of Japan, and the title is\r\nestablished after many curious adventures. To the sun goddess also,\r\nwhose feud with her fierce brother survives the latter's banishment from\r\nheaven, the idea of making her grandson ruler of Japan presents itself.\r\nShe despatches three embassies to impose her will upon the descendants\r\nof Sosanoo, and finally her grandson descends, not, however, in Izumo,\r\nwhere the demi-gods of Sosanoo's race hold sway, but in Hiuga in the\r\nsouthern island of Kiushiu. This grandson of Amaterasu (the goddess of\r\nthe sun) is called Ninigi, whose great-grandson figures in Japanese\r\nhistory as the first human sovereign of the country, known during life\r\nas Kamu-Yamato-Iware-Biko, and given the name of Jimmu tenno (Jimmu, son\r\nof heaven) fourteen centuries after his death. Japanese annalists\r\nattribute the accession of Jimmu to the year 660 B.C. Why that date was\r\nchosen must remain a matter of conjecture. The _Records of Ancient\r\nMatters_ has no chronology, but the more pretentious writers of the\r\n_Chronicles of Japan_, doubtless in imitation of their Chinese models,\r\nconsidered it necessary to assign a year, a month, and even a day for\r\neach event of importance. There is abundant reason, however, to question\r\nthe accuracy of all Japanese chronology prior to the 5th century. The\r\nfirst date corroborated by external evidence is 461, and Aston, who has\r\nmade a special study of the subject, concludes that the year 500 may be\r\ntaken as the time when the chronology of the _Chronicles_ begins to be\r\ntrustworthy. Many Japanese, however, are firm believers in the\r\n_Chronicles_, and when assigning the year of the empire they invariably\r\ntake 660 B.C. for starting-point, so that 1909 of the Gregorian calendar\r\nbecomes for them 2569.\r\n\r\n_Prehistoric Period._--Thus, if the most rigid estimate be accepted, the\r\nspace of 1160 years, from 660 B.C. to A.D. 500, may be called the\r\nprehistoric period. During that long interval the annals include 24\r\nsovereigns, the first 17 of whom lived for over a hundred years on the\r\naverage. It seems reasonable to conclude that the so-called assignment\r\nof the sovereignty of Japan to Sosanoo's descendants and the\r\nestablishment of their kingdom in Izumo represent an invasion of\r\nMongolian immigrants coming from the direction of the Korean\r\npeninsula--indeed one of the _Nihongi's_ versions of the event actually\r\nindicates Korea as the point of departure--and that the subsequent\r\ndescent of Ninigi on Mount Takachiho in Hiuga indicates the advent of a\r\nbody of Malayan settlers from the south sea. Jimmu, according to the\r\n_Chronicles_, set out from Hiuga in 667 B.C. and was not crowned at his\r\nnew palace in Yamato until 660. This campaign of seven years is\r\ndescribed in some detail, but no satisfactory information is given as to\r\nthe nature of the craft in which the invader and his troops voyaged, or\r\nas to the number of men under his command. The weapons said to have been\r\ncarried were bows, spears and swords. A supernatural element is imported\r\ninto the narrative in the form of the three-legged crow of the sun,\r\nwhich Amaterasu sends down to act as guide and messenger for her\r\ndescendants. Jimmu died at his palace of Kashiwa-bara in 585 B.C., his\r\nage being 127 according to the _Chronicles_, and 137 according to the\r\n_Records_. He was buried in a kind of tomb called _misasagi_, which\r\nseems to have been in use in Japan for some centuries before the\r\nChristian era--\"a highly specialized form of tumulus, consisting of two\r\nmounds, one having a circular, the other a triangular base, which merged\r\ninto each other, the whole being surrounded by a moat, or sometimes by\r\ntwo concentric moats with a narrow strip of land between. In some,\r\nperhaps in most, cases the misasagi contains a large vault of great\r\nunhewn stones without mortar. The walls of this vault converge gradually\r\ntowards the top, which is roofed in by enormous slabs of stone weighing\r\nmany tons each. The entrance is by means of a gallery roofed with\r\nsimilar stones.\" Several of these ancient sepulchral mounds have been\r\nexamined during recent years, and their contents have furnished\r\ninformation of much antiquarian interest, though there is a complete\r\nabsence of inscriptions. The reigns of the eight sovereigns who\r\nsucceeded Jimmu were absolutely uneventful. Nothing is set down except\r\nthe genealogy of each ruler, the place of his residence and his burial,\r\nhis age and the date of his death. It was then the custom--and it\r\nremained so until the 8th century of the Christian era--to change the\r\ncapital on the accession of each emperor; a habit which effectually\r\nprevented the growth of any great metropolis. The reign of the 10th\r\nemperor, Sujin, lasted from 98 to 30 B.C. During his era the land was\r\ntroubled by pestilence and the people broke out in rebellion; calamities\r\nwhich were supposed to be caused by the spirit of the ancient ruler of\r\nIzumo to avenge a want of consideration shown to his descendants by\r\ntheir supplanters. Divination--by a Chinese process--and visions\r\nrevealed the source of trouble; rites of worship were performed in\r\nhonour of the ancient ruler, his descendant being entrusted with the\r\nduty, and the pestilence ceased. We now hear for the first time of\r\nvigorous measures to quell the aboriginal savages, doubtless the Ainu.\r\nFour generals are sent out against them in different directions. But the\r\nexpedition is interrupted by an armed attempt on the part of the\r\nemperor's half-brother, who, utilizing the opportunity of the troops'\r\nabsence from Yamato, marches from Yamashiro at the head of a powerful\r\narmy to win the crown for himself. In connexion with these incidents,\r\ncurious evidence is furnished of the place then assigned to woman by the\r\nwriters of the _Chronicles_. It is a girl who warns one of the emperor's\r\ngenerals of the plot; it is the sovereign's aunt who interprets the\r\nwarning; and it is Ata, the wife of the rebellious prince, who leads the\r\nleft wing of his army. Four other noteworthy facts are recorded of this\r\nreign: the taking of a census; the imposition of a tax on animals' skins\r\nand game to be paid by men, and on textile fabrics by women; the\r\nbuilding of boats for coastwise transport, and the digging of dikes and\r\nreservoirs for agricultural purposes. All these things rest solely on\r\nthe testimony of annalists writing eight centuries later than the era\r\nthey discuss and compiling their narrative mostly from tradition.\r\nCareful investigations have been made to ascertain whether the histories\r\nof China and Korea corroborate or contradict those of Japan. Without\r\nentering into detailed evidence, the inference may be at once stated\r\nthat the dates given in Japanese early history are just 120 years too\r\nremote; an error very likely to occur when using the sexagenary cycle,\r\nwhich constituted the first method of reckoning time in Japan. But\r\nalthough this correction suffices to reconcile some contradictory\r\nfeatures of Far-Eastern history, it does not constitute any explanation\r\nof the incredible longevity assigned by the _Chronicles_ to several\r\nJapanese sovereigns, and the conclusion is that when a consecutive\r\nrecord of reigns came to be compiled in the 8th century, many lacunae\r\nwere found which had to be filled up from the imagination of the\r\ncompilers. With this parenthesis we may pass rapidly over the events of\r\nthe next two centuries (29 B.C. to A.D. 200). They are remarkable for\r\nvigorous measures to subdue the aboriginal Ainu, who in the southern\r\nisland of Kiushiu are called Kuma-so (the names of two tribes) and\r\nsometimes earth-spiders (i.e. cave-dwellers), while in the north-eastern\r\nregions of the main island they are designated Yemishi. Expeditions are\r\nled against them in both regions by Prince Yamato-dake, a hero revered\r\nby all succeeding generations of Japanese as the type of valour and\r\nloyalty. Dying from the effects of hardship and exposure, but declaring\r\nwith his last breath that loss of life was as nothing compared with the\r\nsorrow of seeing his father's face no more, his spirit ascends to heaven\r\nas a white bird, and when his son, Chuai, comes to the throne, he causes\r\ncranes to be placed in the moat surrounding his palace in memory of his\r\nillustrious sire.\r\n\r\nThe sovereign had partly ceased to follow the example of Jimmu, who led\r\nhis armies in person. The emperors did not, however, pass a sedentary\r\nlife. They frequently made progresses throughout their dominions, and\r\non these occasions a not uncommon incident was the addition of some\r\nlocal beauty to the Imperial harem. This licence had a far-reaching\r\neffect, since to provide for the sovereign's numerous offspring--the\r\nemperor Keiko (71-130) had 80 children--no better way offered than to\r\nmake grants of land, and thus were laid the foundations of a territorial\r\nnobility destined profoundly to influence the course of Japanese\r\nhistory. Woman continues to figure conspicuously in the story. The image\r\nof the sun goddess, enshrined in Ise (5 B.C.), is entrusted to the\r\nkeeping of a princess, as are the mirror, sword and jewel inherited from\r\nthe sun goddess; a woman (Tachibana) accompanies Prince Yamato-dake in\r\nhis campaign against the Yemishi, and sacrifices her life to quell a\r\ntempest at sea; Saho, consort of Suinin, is the heroine of a most tragic\r\ntale in which the conflict between filial piety and conjugal loyalty\r\nleads to her self-destruction; and a woman is found ruling over a large\r\ndistrict in Kiushu when the Emperor Keiko is engaged in his campaign\r\nagainst the aborigines. The reign of Suinin saw the beginning of an art\r\ndestined to assume extraordinary importance in Japan--the art of\r\nwrestling--and the first champion, Nomi no Sukune, is honoured for\r\nhaving suggested that clay figures should take the place of the human\r\nsacrifices hitherto offered at the sepulture of Imperial personages. The\r\nirrigation works commenced in the time of Sujin were zealously continued\r\nunder his two immediate successors, Suinin and Keiko. More than 800\r\nponds and channels are described as having been constructed under the\r\nformer's rule. We find evidence also that the sway of the throne had\r\nbeen by this time widely extended, for in 125 a governor-general of 15\r\nprovinces is nominated, and two years later, governors (_miyakko_) are\r\nappointed in every province and mayors (_inaki_) in every village. The\r\nnumber or names of these local divisions are not given, but it is\r\nexplained that mountains and rivers were taken as boundaries of\r\nprovinces, the limits of towns and villages being marked by roads\r\nrunning respectively east and west, north and south.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Invasion of Korea.\r\n\r\nAn incident is now reached which the Japanese count a landmark in their\r\nhistory, though foreign critics are disposed to regard it as apocryphal.\r\nIt is the invasion of Korea by a Japanese army under the command of the\r\nempress Jingo, in 200. The emperor Chuai, having proceeded to Kiushiu\r\nfor the purpose of conducting a campaign against the Kuma-so, is there\r\njoined by the empress, who, at the inspiration of a deity, seeks to\r\ndivert the Imperial arms against Korea. But the emperor refuses to\r\nbelieve in the existence of any such country, and heaven punishes his\r\nincredulity with death at the hands of the Kuma-so, according to one\r\naccount; from the effects of disease, according to another. The calamity\r\nis concealed; the Kuma-so are subdued, and the empress, having collected\r\na fleet and raised an army, crosses to the state of Silla (in Korea),\r\nwhere, at the spectacle of her overwhelming strength, the Korean monarch\r\nsubmits without fighting, and swears that until the sun rises in the\r\nwest, until rivers run towards their sources, and until pebbles ascend\r\nto the sky and become stars, he will do homage and send tribute to\r\nJapan. His example is followed by the kings of the two other states\r\nconstituting the Korean peninsula, and the warlike empress returns\r\ntriumphant. Many supernatural elements embellish the tale, but the\r\nfeatures which chiefly discredit it are that it abounds in anachronisms,\r\nand that the event, despite its signal importance, is not mentioned in\r\neither Chinese or Korean history. It is certain that China then\r\npossessed in Korea territory administered by Chinese governors. She must\r\ntherefore have had cognisance of such an invasion, had it occurred.\r\nMoreover, Korean history mentions twenty-five raids made by the Japanese\r\nagainst Silla during the first five centuries of the Christian era, but\r\nnot one of them can be identified with Jingo's alleged expedition. There\r\ncan be no doubt that the early Japanese were an aggressive, enterprising\r\npeople, and that their nearest over-sea neighbour suffered much from\r\ntheir activity. Nor can there be any reasonable doubt that the Jingo\r\ntale contains a large germ of truth, and is at least an echo of the\r\nrelations that existed between Japan and Korea in the 3rd and 4th\r\ncenturies. The records of the 69 years comprising Jingo's reign are in\r\nthe main an account of intercourse, sometimes peaceful, sometimes\r\nstormy, between the neighbouring countries. Only one other episode\r\noccupies a prominent place: it is an attempt on the part of Jingo's\r\nstep-brothers to oppose her return to Yamato and to prevent the\r\naccession of her son to the throne. It should be noted here that all\r\nsuch names as Jimmu, Sujin, Chuai, &c., are posthumous, and were\r\ninvented in the reign of Kwammu (782-806), the fashion being taken from\r\nChina and the names themselves being purely Chinese translations of the\r\nqualities assigned to the respective monarchs. Thus Jimmu signifies\r\n\"divine valour\"; Sujin, \"deity-honouring\"; and Chuai, \"sad middle son.\"\r\nThe names of these rulers during life were wholly different from their\r\nposthumous appellations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Earliest Notices in Chinese History.\r\n\r\nChinese history, which is incomparably older and more precise than\r\nKorean, is by no means silent about Japan. Long notices occur in the\r\nlater Han and Wei records (25 to 265). The Japanese are spoken of as\r\ndwarfs (_Wa_), and their islands, frequently called the queen country,\r\nare said to be mountainous, with soil suitable for growing grain, hemp,\r\nand the silkworm mulberry. The climate is so mild that vegetables can be\r\ngrown in winter and summer; there are neither oxen, horses, tigers, nor\r\nleopards; the people understand the art of weaving; the men tattoo their\r\nfaces and bodies in patterns indicating differences of rank; male attire\r\nconsists of a single piece of cloth; females wear a gown passed over the\r\nhead, and tie their hair in a bow; soldiers are armed with spears and\r\nshields, and also with bows, from which they discharge arrows tipped\r\nwith bone or iron; the sovereign resides in Yamato; there are stockaded\r\nforts and houses; food is taken with the fingers but is served on bamboo\r\ntrays and wooden trenchers; foot-gear is not worn; when men of the lower\r\nclasses meet a man of rank, they leave the road and retire to the grass,\r\nsquatting or kneeling with both hands on the ground when they address\r\nhim; intoxicating liquor is much used; the people are long-lived, many\r\nreaching the age of 100; women are more numerous than men; there is no\r\ntheft, and litigation is infrequent; the women are faithful and not\r\njealous; all men of high rank have four or five wives, others two or\r\nthree; wives and children of law-breakers are confiscated, and for grave\r\ncrimes the offender's family is extirpated; divination is practised by\r\nburning bones; mourning lasts for some ten days and the rites are\r\nperformed by a \"mourning-keeper\"; after a funeral the whole family\r\nperform ablutions; fishing is much practised, and the fishermen are\r\nskilled divers; there are distinctions of rank and some are vassals to\r\nothers; each province has a market where goods are exchanged; the\r\ncountry is divided into more than 100 provinces, and among its products\r\nare white pearls, green jade and cinnabar. These annals go on to say\r\nthat between 147 and 190 civil war prevailed for several years, and\r\norder was finally restored by a female sovereign, who is described as\r\nhaving been old and unmarried; much addicted to magic arts; attended by\r\na thousand females; dwelling in a palace with lofty pavilions surrounded\r\nby a stockade and guarded by soldiers; but leading such a secluded life\r\nthat few saw her face except one man who served her meals and acted as a\r\nmedium of communication. There can be little question that this queen\r\nwas the empress Jingo who, according to Japanese annals, came to the\r\nthrone in the year A.D. 200, and whose every public act had its\r\ninception or promotion in some alleged divine interposition. In one\r\npoint, however, the Chinese historians are certainly incorrect. They\r\nrepresent tattooing as universal in ancient Japan, whereas it was\r\nconfined to criminals, in whose case it played the part that branding\r\ndoes elsewhere. Centuries later, in feudal days, the habit came to be\r\npractised by men of the lower orders whose avocations involved baring\r\nthe body, but it never acquired vogue among educated people. In other\r\nrespects these ancient Chinese annals must be credited with remarkable\r\naccuracy in their description of Japan and the Japanese. Their account\r\nmay be advantageously compared with Professor Chamberlain's analysis of\r\nthe manners and customs of the early Japanese, in the preface to his\r\ntranslation of the _Kojiki_.\r\n\r\n  \"The Japanese of the mythical period, as pictured in the legends\r\n  preserved by the compiler of the _Records of Ancient Matters_, were a\r\n  race who had long emerged from the savage stage and had attained to a\r\n  high level of barbaric skill. The Stone Age was forgotten by them--or\r\n  nearly so--and the evidence points to their never having passed\r\n  through a genuine Bronze Age, though the knowledge of bronze was at a\r\n  later period introduced from the neighbouring continent. They used\r\n  iron for manufacturing spears, swords and knives of various shapes,\r\n  and likewise for the more peaceful purpose of making hooks wherewith\r\n  to angle or to fasten the doors of their huts. Their other warlike and\r\n  hunting implements (besides traps and gins, which appear to have been\r\n  used equally for catching beasts and birds and for destroying human\r\n  enemies) were bows and arrows, spears and elbow-pads--the latter\r\n  seemingly of skin, while special allusion is made to the fact that the\r\n  arrows were feathered. Perhaps clubs should be added to the list. Of\r\n  the bows and arrows, swords and knives, there is perpetual mention,\r\n  but nowhere do we hear of the tools with which they were manufactured,\r\n  and there is the same remarkable silence regarding such widely spread\r\n  domestic implements as the saw and the axe. We hear, however, of the\r\n  pestle and mortar, of the fire-drill, of the wedge, of the sickle, and\r\n  of the shuttle used in weaving. Navigation seems to have been in a\r\n  very elementary state. Indeed the art of sailing was but little\r\n  practised in Japan even so late as the middle of the 10th century of\r\n  our era, subsequent to the general diffusion of Chinese civilization,\r\n  though rowing and punting are often mentioned by the early poets. To\r\n  what we should call towns or villages very little reference is made\r\n  anywhere in the _Records_ or in that part of the _Chronicles_ which\r\n  contain the account of the so-called Divine Age. But from what we\r\n  learn incidentally it would seem that the scanty population was\r\n  chiefly distributed in small hamlets and isolated dwellings along the\r\n  coast and up the course of the larger streams. Of house-building there\r\n  is frequent mention. Fences were in use. Rugs of skins and\r\n  rush-matting were occasionally brought in to sit on, and we even hear\r\n  once or twice of silk rugs being used for the same purpose by the\r\n  noble and wealthy. The habits of personal cleanliness which so\r\n  pleasantly distinguish the modern Japanese from their neighbours, in\r\n  continental Asia, though less fully developed than at present would\r\n  seem to have existed in the germ in early times, as we read more than\r\n  once of bathing in rivers, and are told of bathing women being\r\n  specially attached to the person of a certain Imperial infant.\r\n  Lustrations, too, formed part of the religious practices of the race.\r\n  Latrines are mentioned several times. They would appear to have been\r\n  situated away from the houses and to have been generally placed over a\r\n  running stream, whence doubtless the name for latrine in the archaic\r\n  dialect--_kawaya_ (river-house). A peculiar sort of dwelling-place\r\n  which the two old histories bring prominently under our notice is the\r\n  so-called parturition house--a one-roomed hut without windows, which a\r\n  woman was expected to build and retire into for the purpose Of being\r\n  delivered unseen. Castles are not distinctly spoken of until a time\r\n  which coincides, according to the received chronology, with the first\r\n  century B.C. We then first meet with the curious term rice-castle,\r\n  whose precise signification is a matter of dispute among the native\r\n  commentators, but which, on comparison with Chinese descriptions of\r\n  the early Japanese, should probably be understood to mean a kind of\r\n  palisade serving the purpose of a redoubt, behind which the warriors\r\n  could ensconce themselves. The food of the early Japanese consisted of\r\n  fish and of the flesh of the wild creatures which fell by the hunter's\r\n  arrow or were taken in the trapper's snare. Rice is the only cereal of\r\n  which there is such mention made as to place it beyond a doubt that\r\n  its cultivation dates back to time immemorial. Beans, millet and\r\n  barley are indeed named once, together with silkworms, in the account\r\n  of the Divine Age. But the passage has every aspect of an\r\n  interpolation in the legend, perhaps not dating back long before the\r\n  time of the eighth-century compiler. A few unimportant vegetables and\r\n  fruits, of most of which there is but a single mention, are found. The\r\n  intoxicating liquor called _sake_ was known in Japan during the\r\n  mythical period, and so were chopsticks for eating food with. Cooking\r\n  pots and cups and dishes--the latter both of earthenware and of leaves\r\n  of trees--are also mentioned; but of the use of fire for warming\r\n  purposes we hear nothing. Tables are named several times, but never in\r\n  connexion with food: they would seem to have been used exclusively for\r\n  the purpose of presenting offerings on, and were probably quite small\r\n  and low--in fact, rather trays than tables, according to European\r\n  ideas. In the use of clothing and the specialization of garments the\r\n  early Japanese had reached a high level. We read in the most ancient\r\n  legends of upper garments, skirts, trowsers, girdles, veils and hats,\r\n  while both sexes adorned themselves with necklaces, bracelets and head\r\n  ornaments of stones considered precious--in this respect offering a\r\n  striking contrast to their descendants in modern times, of whose\r\n  attire jewelry forms no part. The material of their clothes was hempen\r\n  cloth and paper--mulberry bark, coloured by being rubbed with madder,\r\n  and probably with woad and other tinctorial plants. All the garments,\r\n  so far as we may judge, were woven, sewing being nowhere mentioned.\r\n  From the great place which the chase occupied in daily life, we are\r\n  led to suppose that skins also were used to make garments of. There is\r\n  in the _Records_ at least one passage which favours this supposition,\r\n  and the _Chronicles_ in one place mention the straw rain-coat and\r\n  broad-brimmed hat, which still form the Japanese peasant's effectual\r\n  protection against the inclemencies of the weather. The tendrils of\r\n  creeping plants served the purposes of strings, and bound the\r\n  warrior's sword round his waist. Combs are mentioned, and it is\r\n  evident that much attention was devoted to the dressing of the hair.\r\n  The men seem to have bound up their hair in two bunches, one on each\r\n  side of the head, while the young boys tied theirs in a top-knot, the\r\n  unmarried girls let their locks hang down over their necks, and the\r\n  married women dressed theirs after a fashion which apparently combined\r\n  the two last-named methods. There is no mention in any of the old\r\n  books of cutting the hair or beard except in token of disgrace;\r\n  neither do we gather that the sexes, but for the matter of the\r\n  head-dress, were distinguished by a diversity of apparel and\r\n  ornamentation. With regard to the precious stones mentioned above as\r\n  having been used as ornaments for the head, neck and arms, we know\r\n  from the specimens which have rewarded the labours of archaeological\r\n  research in Japan that agate, crystal, glass, jade, serpentine and\r\n  steatite were the most used materials, and carved and pierced\r\n  cylindrical shapes the commonest forms. The horse--which was ridden,\r\n  but not driven--the barn-door fowl and the cormorant used for fishing,\r\n  are the only domesticated creatures mentioned in the earlier\r\n  traditions, with the doubtful exception of the silkworm. In the later\r\n  portions of the _Records_ and _Chronicles_ dogs and cattle are alluded\r\n  to, but sheep, swine and even cats were apparently not yet\r\n  introduced.\"\r\n\r\nAs the prehistoric era draws to its end the above analyses of Japanese\r\ncivilization have to be modified. Thus, towards the close of the 3rd\r\ncentury, ship-building made great progress, and instead of the small\r\nboats hitherto in use, a vessel 100 ft. long was constructed. Notable\r\nabove all is the fact that Japan's turbulent relations with Korea were\r\nreplaced by friendly intercourse, so that she began to receive from her\r\nneighbour instruction in the art of writing. The date assigned by the\r\n_Chronicles_ for this important event is A.D. 285, but it has been\r\nproved almost conclusively that Japanese annals relating to this period\r\nare in error to the extent of 120 years. Hence the introduction of\r\ncalligraphy must be placed in 405. Chinese history shows that between 57\r\nand 247 Japan sent four embassies to the courts of the Han and the Wei,\r\nand this intercourse cannot have failed to disclose the ideograph. But\r\nthe knowledge appears to have been confined to a few interpreters, and\r\nnot until the year 405 were steps taken to extend it, with the aid of a\r\nlearned Korean, Wang-in. Korea herself began to study Chinese learning\r\nonly a few years before she undertook to impart it to Japan. We now find\r\na numerous colony of Koreans passing to Japan and settling there; a\r\nlarge number are also carried over as prisoners of war, and the Japanese\r\nobtain seamstresses from both of their continental neighbours. One fact,\r\nrelated with much precision, shows that the refinements of life were in\r\nan advanced condition: an ice-house is described, and we read that from\r\n374 (? 494) it became the fashion to store ice in this manner for use in\r\nthe hot months by placing it in water or _sake_. The emperor, Nintoku,\r\nto whose time this innovation is attributed, is one of the romantic\r\nfigures of Japanese history. He commenced his career by refusing to\r\naccept the sovereignty from his younger brother, who pressed him\r\nearnestly to do so on the ground that the proper order of succession had\r\nbeen disturbed by their father's partiality--though the rights attaching\r\nto primogeniture did not receive imperative recognition in early Japan.\r\nAfter three years of this mutual self-effacement, during which the\r\nthrone remained vacant, the younger brother committed suicide, and\r\nNintoku reluctantly became sovereign. He chose Naniwa (the modern Osaka)\r\nfor his capital, but he would not take the farmers from their work to\r\nfinish the building of a palace, and subsequently, inferring from the\r\nabsence of smoke over the houses of the people that the country was\r\nimpoverished, he remitted all taxes and suspended forced labour for a\r\nterm of three years, during which his palace fell into a state of ruin\r\nand he himself fared in the coarsest manner. Digging canals, damming\r\nrivers, constructing roads and bridges, and establishing granaries\r\noccupied his attention when love did not distract it. But in affairs of\r\nthe heart he was most unhappy. He figures as the sole wearer of the\r\nJapanese crown who was defied by his consort; for when he took a\r\nconcubine in despite of the empress, her jealousy was so bitter that,\r\nrefusing to be placated by any of his majesty's verses or other\r\novertures, she left the palace altogether; and when he sought to\r\nintroduce another beauty into the inner chamber, his own half-brother,\r\nwho carried his proposals, won the girl for himself. One other fact\r\ndeserves to be remembered in connexion with Nintoku's reign:\r\nKi-no-tsuno, representative of a great family which had filled the\r\nhighest administrative and military posts under several sovereigns, is\r\nmentioned as \"the first to commit to writing in detail the productions\r\nof the soil in each locality.\" This was in 353 (probably 473). We shall\r\nerr little if we date the commencement of Japanese written annals from\r\nthis time, though no compilation earlier than the _Kojiki_ has survived.\r\n\r\n_Early Historical Period._--With the emperor Richu, who came to the\r\nthrone A.D. 400, the historical period may be said to commence; for\r\nthough the chronology of the records is still questionable, the facts\r\nare generally accepted as credible. Conspicuous loyalty towards the\r\nsovereign was not an attribute of the Japanese Imperial family in early\r\ntimes. Attempts to usurp the throne were not uncommon, though there are\r\nvery few instances of such essays on the part of a subject. Love or lust\r\nplayed no insignificant part in the drama, and a common method of\r\nplacating an irate sovereign was to present a beautiful damsel for his\r\ndelectation. The veto of consanguinity did not receive very strict\r\nrespect in these matters. Children of the same father might intermarry,\r\nbut not those of the same mother; a canon which becomes explicable on\r\nobserving that as wives usually lived apart from their husbands and had\r\nthe sole custody of their offspring, two or more families often remained\r\nto the end unconscious of the fact that they had a common sire. There\r\nwas a remarkable tendency to organize the nation into groups of persons\r\nfollowing the same pursuit or charged with the same functions. A group\r\nthus composed was called _be_. The heads of the great families had\r\ntitles--as _omi_, _muraji_, _miakko_, _wake_, &c.--and affairs of state\r\nwere administered by the most renowned of these nobles, wholly subject\r\nto the sovereign's ultimate will. The provincial districts were ruled by\r\nscions of the Imperial family, who appear to have been, on the whole,\r\nentirely subservient to the Throne. There were no tribunals of justice:\r\nthe ordeal of boiling water or heated metal was the sole test of guilt\r\nor innocence, apart, of course, from confession, which was often exacted\r\nunder menace of torture. A celebrated instance of the ordeal of boiling\r\nwater is recorded in 415, when this device was employed to correct the\r\ngenealogies of families suspected of falsely claiming descent from\r\nemperors or divine beings. The test proved efficacious, for men\r\nconscious of forgery refused to undergo the ordeal. Deprivation of rank\r\nwas the lightest form of punishment; death the commonest, and\r\noccasionally the whole family of an offender became serfs of the house\r\nagainst which the offence had been committed or which had been\r\ninstrumental in disclosing a crime. There are, however, frequent\r\nexamples of wrong-doing expiated by the voluntary surrender of lands or\r\nother property. We find several instances of that extreme type of\r\nloyalty which became habitual in later ages--suicide in preference to\r\nsurviving a deceased lord. On the whole the successive sovereigns of\r\nthese early times appear to have ruled with clemency and consideration\r\nfor the people's welfare. But there were two notable exceptions--Yuriaku\r\n(457-479) and Muretsu (499-506). The former slew men ruthlessly in fits\r\nof passion or resentment, and the latter was the Nero of Japanese\r\nhistory, a man who loved to witness the agony of his fellows and knew no\r\nsentiment of mercy or remorse. Yet even Yuriaku did not fail to promote\r\nindustrial pursuits. Skilled artisans were obtained from Korea, and it\r\nis related that, in 462, this monarch induced the empress and the ladies\r\nof the palace to plant mulberry trees with their own hands in order to\r\nencourage sericulture. Throughout the 5th and 6th centuries many\r\ninstances are recorded of the acquisition of landed estates by the\r\nThrone, and their occasional bestowal upon princes or Imperial consorts,\r\nsuch gifts being frequently accompanied by the assignment of bodies of\r\nagriculturists who seem to have accepted the position of serfs.\r\nMeanwhile Chinese civilization was gradually becoming known, either by\r\ndirect contact or through Korea. Several immigrations of Chinese or\r\nKorean settlers are on record. No less than 7053 householders of Chinese\r\nsubjects came, through Korea, in 540, and one of their number received\r\nhigh rank together with the post of director of the Imperial treasury.\r\nFrom these facts, and from a national register showing the derivation of\r\nall the principal families in Japan, it is clearly established that a\r\nconsiderable strain of Chinese and Korean blood runs in the veins of\r\nmany Japanese subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Introduction of Buddhism.\r\n\r\nThe most signal and far-reaching event of this epoch was the importation\r\nof the Buddhist creed, which took place in 552. A Korean monarch acted\r\nas propagandist, sending a special envoy with a bronze image of the\r\nBuddha and with several volumes of the Sutras. Unfortunately the coming\r\nof the foreign faith happened to synchronize with an epidemic of plague,\r\nand conservatives at the Imperial court were easily able to attribute\r\nthis visitation to resentment on the part of the ancestral deities\r\nagainst the invasion of Japan by an alien creed. Thus the spread of\r\nBuddhism was checked; but only for a time. Thirty-five years after the\r\ncoming of the Sutras, the first temple was erected to enshrine a wooden\r\nimage of the Buddha 16 ft. high. It has often been alleged that the\r\nquestion between the imported and the indigenous cults had to be decided\r\nby the sword. The statement is misleading. That the final adoption of\r\nBuddhism resulted from a war is true, but its adoption or rejection did\r\nnot constitute the motive of the combat. A contest for the succession to\r\nthe throne at the opening of Sujun's reign (588-592) found the partisans\r\nof the Indian faith ranged on one side, its opponents on the other, and\r\nin a moment of stress the leaders of the former, Soma and Prince\r\nUmayado, vowed to erect Buddhist temples should victory rest on their\r\narms. From that time the future of Buddhism was assured. In 588 Korea\r\nsent Buddhist relics, Buddhist priests, Buddhist ascetics, architects of\r\nBuddhist temples, and casters of Buddhist images. She had already sent\r\nmen learned in divination, in medicine, and in the calendar. The\r\nbuilding of temples began to be fashionable in the closing years of the\r\n6th century, as did also abdication of the world by people of both\r\nsexes; and a census taken in 623, during the reign of the empress Suiko\r\n(583-628), showed that there were then 46 temples, 816 priests and 569\r\nnuns in the empire. This rapid growth of the alien faith was due mainly\r\nto two causes: first, that the empress Suiko, being of the Soga family,\r\nnaturally favoured a creed which had found its earliest Japanese patron\r\nin the great statesman and general, Soga no Umako; secondly, that one of\r\nthe most illustrious scholars and philosophers ever possessed by Japan,\r\nPrince Shotoku, devoted all his energies to fostering Buddhism.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of Buddhism meant to the Japanese much more than the\r\nacquisition of a practical religion with a code of clearly defined\r\nmorality in place of the amorphous and jejune cult of Shinto. It meant\r\nthe introduction of Chinese civilization. Priests and scholars crossed\r\nin numbers from China, and men passed over from Japan to study the\r\nSutras at what was then regarded as the fountain-head of Buddhism. There\r\nwas also a constant stream of immigrants from China and Korea, and the\r\nresult may be gathered from the fact that a census taken of the Japanese\r\nnobility in 814 indicated 382 Korean and Chinese families against only\r\n796 of pure Japanese origin. The records show that in costume and\r\ncustoms a signal advance was made towards refinement. Hair-ornaments of\r\ngold or silver chiselled in the form of flowers; caps of sarcenet in\r\ntwelve special tints, each indicating a different grade; garments of\r\nbrocade and embroidery with figured thin silks of various colours--all\r\nthese were worn on ceremonial occasions; the art of painting was\r\nintroduced; a recorder's office was established; perfumes were largely\r\nemployed; court picnics to gather medicinal herbs were instituted,\r\nprinces and princesses attending in brilliant raiment; Chinese music and\r\ndancing were introduced; cross bows and catapults were added to the\r\nweapons of war; domestic architecture made signal strides in obedience\r\nto the examples of Buddhist sacred edifices, which, from the first,\r\nshowed magnificence of dimension and decoration hitherto unconceived in\r\nJapan; the arts of metal-casting and sculpture underwent great\r\nimprovement; Prince Shotoku compiled a code, commonly spoken of as the\r\nfirst written laws of Japan, but in reality a collection of maxims\r\nevincing a moral spirit of the highest type. In some respects, however,\r\nthere was no improvement. The succession to the throne still tended to\r\nprovoke disputes among the Imperial princes; the sword constituted the\r\nprincipal weapon of punishment, and torture the chief judicial device.\r\nNow, too, for the first time, a noble family is found seeking to usurp\r\nthe Imperial authority. The head of the Soga house, Umako, having\r\ncompassed the murder of the emperor Sujun and placed on the throne his\r\nown niece (Suiko), swept away all opposition to the latter's successor,\r\nJomei, and controlled the administration of state affairs throughout two\r\nreigns. In all this he was strongly seconded by his son, Iruka, who even\r\nsurpassed him in contumelious assumption of power and parade of dignity.\r\nIruka was slain in the presence of the empress Kogyoku by Prince Naka\r\nwith the assistance of the minister of the interior, Kamako, and it is\r\nnot surprising to find the empress (Kogyoku) abdicating immediately\r\nafterwards in favour of Kamako's protégé, Prince Karu, who is known in\r\nhistory as Kotoku. This Kamako, planner and leader of the conspiracy\r\nwhich overthrew the Soga, is remembered by posterity under the name of\r\nKamatari and as the founder of the most illustrious of Japan's noble\r\nhouses, the Fujiwara. At this time (645), a habit which afterwards\r\ncontributed materially to the effacement of the Throne's practical\r\nauthority was inaugurated. Prince Furubito, pressed by his brother,\r\nPrince Karu, to assume the sceptre in accordance with his right of\r\nprimogeniture, made his refusal peremptory by abandoning the world and\r\ntaking the tonsure. This retirement to a monastery was afterwards\r\ndictated to several sovereigns by ministers who found that an active\r\noccupant of the throne impeded their own exercise of administrative\r\nautocracy. Furubito's recourse to the tonsure proved, however, to be\r\nmerely a cloak for ambitious designs. Before a year had passed he\r\nconspired to usurp the throne and was put to death with his children,\r\nhis consorts strangling themselves. Suicide to escape the disgrace of\r\ndefeat had now become a common practice. Another prominent feature of\r\nthis epoch was the prevalence of superstition. The smallest\r\nincidents--the growing of two lotus flowers on one stem; a popular\r\nballad; the reputed song of a sleeping monkey; the condition of the\r\nwater in a pond; rain without clouds--all these and cognate trifles were\r\nregarded as omens; wizards and witches deluded the common people; a\r\nstrange form of caterpillar was worshipped as the god of the everlasting\r\nworld, and the peasants impoverished themselves by making sacrifices to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n  First Legislative Epoch.\r\n\r\nAn interesting epoch is now reached, the first legislative era of early\r\nJapanese history. It commenced with the reign of the emperor Kotoku\r\n(645), of whom the _Chronicles_ say that he \"honoured the religion of\r\nBuddha and despised Shinto\"; that \"he was of gentle disposition; loved\r\nmen of learning; made no distinction of noble and mean, and continually\r\ndispensed beneficent edicts.\" The customs calling most loudly for reform\r\nin his time were abuse of the system of forced labour; corrupt\r\nadministration of justice; spoliation of the peasant class; assumption\r\nof spurious titles to justify oppression; indiscriminate distribution of\r\nthe families of slaves and serfs; diversion of taxes to the pockets of\r\ncollectors; formation of great estates, and a general lack of\r\nadministrative centralization. The first step of reform consisted in\r\nordering the governors of provinces to prepare registers showing the\r\nnumbers of freemen and serfs within their jurisdiction as well as the\r\narea of cultivated land. It was further ordained that the advantages of\r\nirrigation should be shared equally with the common people; that no\r\nlocal governor might try and decide criminal cases while in his\r\nprovince; that any one convicted of accepting bribes should be liable to\r\na fine of double the amount as well as to other punishment; that in the\r\nImperial court a box should be placed for receiving petitions and a bell\r\nhung to be sounded in the event of delay in answering them or unfairness\r\nin dealing with them; that all absorption of land into great estates\r\nshould cease; that barriers, outposts, guards and post-horses should be\r\nprovided; that high officials should be dowered with hereditary estates\r\nby way of emolument, the largest of such grants being 3000 homesteads;\r\nthat men of unblemished character and proved capacity should be\r\nappointed aldermen for adjudicating criminal matters; that there should\r\nbe chosen as clerks for governors and vice-governors of provinces men of\r\nsolid competence \"skilled in writing and arithmetic\"; that the land\r\nshould be parcelled out in fixed proportions to every adult unit of the\r\npopulation with right of tenure for a term of six years; that forced\r\nlabour should be commuted for taxes of silk and cloth; and that for\r\nfiscal and administrative purposes households should be organized in\r\ngroups of five, each group under an elder, and ten groups forming a\r\ntownship, which, again, should be governed by an elder. Incidentally to\r\nthese reforms many of the evil customs of the time are exposed. Thus\r\nprovincial governors when they visited the capital were accustomed to\r\ntravel with great retinues who appear to have constituted a charge on\r\nthe regions through which they passed. The law now limited the number of\r\na chief governor's attendants to nine, and forbade him to use official\r\nhouses or to fare at public cost unless journeying on public business.\r\nAgain, men who had acquired some local distinction, though they did not\r\nbelong to noble families, took advantage of the absence of historical\r\nrecords or official registers, and, representing themselves as\r\ndescendants of magnates to whom the charge of public granaries had been\r\nentrusted, succeeded in usurping valuable privileges. The office of\r\nprovincial governor had in many cases become hereditary, and not only\r\nwere governors largely independent of Imperial control, but also, since\r\nevery free man carried arms, there had grown up about these officials a\r\npopulation relying largely on the law of force. Kotoku's reforms sought\r\nto institute a system of temporary governors, and directed that all arms\r\nand armour should be stored in arsenals built in waste places, except in\r\nthe case of provinces adjoining lands where unsubdued aborigines\r\n(Yemishi) dwelt. Punishments were drastic, and in the case of a man\r\nconvicted of treason, all his children were executed with him, his wives\r\nand consorts committing suicide. From a much earlier age suicide had\r\nbeen freely resorted to as the most honourable exit from pending\r\ndisgrace, but as yet the samurai's method of disembowelment was not\r\nemployed, strangulation or cutting the throat being the regular\r\npractice. Torture was freely employed and men often died under it.\r\nSignal abuses prevailed in regions beyond the immediate range of the\r\ncentral government's observation. It has been shown that from early days\r\nthe numerous scions of the Imperial family had generally been provided\r\nfor by grants of provincial estates. Gradually the descendants of these\r\nmen, and the representatives of great families who held hereditary rank,\r\nextended their domains unscrupulously, employing forced labour to\r\nreclaim lands, which they let to the peasants, not hesitating to\r\nappropriate large slices of public property, and remitting to the\r\ncentral treasury only such fractions of the taxes as they found\r\nconvenient. So prevalent had the exaction of forced labour become that\r\ncountry-folk, repairing to the capital to seek redress of grievances,\r\nwere often compelled to remain there for the purpose of carrying out\r\nsome work in which dignitaries of state were interested. The removal of\r\nthe capital to a new site on each change of sovereign involved a vast\r\nquantity of unproductive toil. It is recorded that in 656, when the\r\nempress Saimei occupied the throne, a canal was dug which required the\r\nwork of 30,000 men and a wall was built which had employed 70,000 men\r\nbefore its completion. The construction of tombs for grandees was\r\nanother heavy drain on the people's labour. Some of these sepulchres\r\nattained enormous dimensions--that of the emperor Ojin (270-310)\r\nmeasures 2312 yds. round the outer moat and is some 60 ft. high; the\r\nemperor Nintoku's (313-399) is still larger, and there is a tumulus in\r\nKawachi on the flank of which a good-sized village has been built.\r\nKotoku's laws provided that the tomb of a prince should not be so large\r\nas to require the work of more than 1000 men for seven days, and that\r\nthe grave of a petty official must be completed by 50 men in one day.\r\nMoreover, it was forbidden to bury with the body gold, silver, copper,\r\niron, jewelled shirts, jade armour or silk brocade. It appears that the\r\ncustom of suicide or sacrifice at the tomb of grandees still survived,\r\nand that people sometimes cut off their hair or stabbed their thighs\r\npreparatory to declaiming a threnody. All these practices were vetoed.\r\nAbuses had grown up even in connexion with the Shinto rite of purgation.\r\nThis rite required not only the reading of rituals but also the offering\r\nof food and fruits. For the sake of these edibles the rite was often\r\nharshly enforced, especially in connexion with pollution from contact\r\nwith corpses; and thus it fell out that when of two brothers, returning\r\nfrom a scene of forced labour, one lay down upon the road and died, the\r\nother, dreading the cost of compulsory purgation, refused to take up the\r\nbody. Many other evil customs came into existence in connexion with this\r\nrite, and all were dealt with in the new laws. Not the least important\r\nof the reforms then introduced was the organization of the ministry\r\nafter the model of the Tang dynasty of China. Eight departments of state\r\nwere created, and several of them received names which are similarly\r\nused to this day. Not only the institutions of China were borrowed but\r\nalso her official costumes. During Kotoku's reign 19 grades of head-gear\r\nwere instituted, and in the time of Tenchi (668-671) the number was\r\nincreased to 26, with corresponding robes. Throughout this era\r\nintercourse was frequent with China, and the spread of Buddhism\r\ncontinued steadily. The empress Saimei (655-661), who succeeded Kotoku,\r\nwas an earnest patron of the faith. By her command several public\r\nexpositions of the Sutras were given, and the building of temples went\r\non in many districts, estates being liberally granted for the\r\nmaintenance of these places of worship.\r\n\r\n_The Fujiwara Era._--In the _Chronicles of Japan_ the year 672 is\r\ntreated as a kind of interregnum. It was in truth a year of something\r\nlike anarchy, a great part of it being occupied by a conflict of\r\nunparalleled magnitude between Prince Otomo (called in history Emperor\r\nKobun) and Prince Oama, who emerged victorious and is historically\r\nentitled Temmu (673-686). The four centuries that followed are\r\nconveniently designated the Fujiwara era, because throughout that long\r\ninterval affairs of state were controlled by the Fujiwara family, whose\r\ndaughters were given as consorts to successive sovereigns and whose sons\r\nfilled all the high administrative posts. It has been related above that\r\nKamako, chief of the Shinto officials, inspired the assassination of the\r\nSoga chief, Iruka, and thus defeated the latter's designs upon the\r\nthrone in the days of the empress Kogyoku. Kamako, better known to\r\nsubsequent generations as Kamatari, was thenceforth regarded with\r\nunlimited favour by successive sovereigns, and just before his death in\r\n670, the family name of Fujiwara was bestowed on him by the emperor\r\nTenchi. Kamatari himself deserved all the honour he received, but his\r\ndescendants abused the high trust reposed in them, reduced the sovereign\r\nto a mere puppet, and exercised Imperial authority without openly\r\nusurping it. Much of this was due to the adoption of Chinese\r\nadministrative systems, a process which may be said to have commenced\r\nduring the reign of Kotoku (645-654) and to have continued almost\r\nuninterruptedly until the 11th century. Under these systems the emperor\r\nceased directly to exercise supreme civil or military power: he became\r\nmerely the source of authority, not its wielder, the civil functions\r\nbeing delegated to a bureaucracy and the military to a soldier class.\r\nPossibly had the custom held of transferring the capital to a new site\r\non each change of sovereign, and had the growth of luxurious habits been\r\nthus checked, the comparatively simple life of early times might have\r\nheld the throne and the people in closer contact. But from the beginning\r\nof the 8th century a strong tendency to avoid these costly migrations\r\ndeveloped itself. In 709 the court took up its residence at Nara,\r\nremaining there until 784; ten years after the latter date Kioto became\r\nthe permanent metropolis. The capital at Nara--established during the\r\nreign of the empress Gemmyo (708-715)--was built on the plan of the\r\nChinese metropolis. It had nine gates and nine avenues, the palace being\r\nsituated in the northern section and approached by a broad, straight\r\navenue, which divided the city into two perfectly equal halves, all the\r\nother streets running parallel to this main avenue or at right angles\r\nto it. Seven sovereigns reigned at Heijo (castle of peace), as Nara is\r\nhistorically called, and, during this period of 75 years, seven of the\r\ngrandest temples ever seen in Japan were erected; a multitude of idols\r\nwere cast, among them a colossal bronze Daibutsu 53½ ft. high; large\r\ntemple-bells were founded, and all the best artists and artisans of the\r\nera devoted their services to these works. This religious mania reached\r\nits acme in the reign of the emperor Shomu (724-748), a man equally\r\nsuperstitious and addicted to display. In Temmu's time the custom had\r\nbeen introduced of compelling large numbers of persons to enter the\r\nBuddhist priesthood with the object of propitiating heaven's aid to heal\r\nthe illness of an illustrious personage. In Shomu's day every natural\r\ncalamity or abnormal phenomenon was regarded as calling for religious\r\nservices on a large scale, and the great expense involved in all these\r\nbuildings and ceremonials, supplemented by lavish outlays on court\r\npageants, was severely felt by the nation. The condition of the\r\nagricultural class, who were the chief tax-payers, was further\r\naggravated by the operation of the emperor Kotoku's land system, which\r\nrendered tenure so uncertain as to deter improvements. Therefore, in the\r\nNara epoch, the principle of private ownership of land began to be\r\nrecognized. Attention was also paid to road-making, bridge-building,\r\nriver control and house construction, a special feature of this last\r\nbeing the use of tiles for roofing purposes in place of the shingles or\r\nthatch hitherto employed. In all these steps of progress Buddhist\r\npriests took an active part. Costumes were now governed by purely\r\nChinese fashions. This change had been gradually introduced from the\r\ntime of Kotoku's legislative measures--generally called the Taikwa\r\nreforms after the name of the era (645-650) of their adoption--and was\r\nrendered more thorough by supplementary enactments in the period 701-703\r\nwhile Mommu occupied the throne. Ladies seem by this time to have\r\nabandoned the strings of beads worn in early eras round the neck, wrists\r\nand ankles. They used ornaments of gold, silver or jade in their hair,\r\nbut in other respects their habiliments closely resembled those of men,\r\nand to make the difference still less conspicuous they straddled their\r\nhorses when riding. Attempts were made to facilitate travel by\r\nestablishing stores of grain along the principal highways, but as yet\r\nthere were no hostelries, and if a wayfarer did not find shelter in the\r\nhouse of a friend, he had to bivouac as best he could. Such a state of\r\naffairs in the provinces offered a marked contrast to the luxurious\r\nindulgence which had now begun to prevail in the capital. There\r\nfestivals of various kinds, dancing, verse-composing, flower picnics,\r\narchery, polo, football--of a very refined nature--hawking, hunting and\r\ngambling absorbed the attention of the aristocracy. Nothing disturbed\r\nthe serenity of the epoch except a revolt of the northern Yemishi, which\r\nwas temporarily subdued by a Fujiwara general, for the Fujiwara had not\r\nyet laid aside the martial habits of their ancestors. In 794 the\r\nImperial capital was transferred from Nara to Kioto by order of the\r\nemperor Kwammu, one of the greatest of Japanese sovereigns. Education,\r\nthe organization of the civil service, riparian works, irrigation\r\nimprovements, the separation of religion from politics, the abolition of\r\nsinecure offices, devices for encouraging and assisting agriculture, all\r\nreceived attention from him. But a twenty-two years' campaign against\r\nthe northern Yemishi; the building of numerous temples; the indulgence\r\nof such a passionate love of the chase that he organized 140 hunting\r\nexcursions during his reign of 25 years; profuse extravagance on the\r\npart of the aristocracy in Kioto and the exactions of provincial nobles,\r\nconspired to sink the working classes into greater depths of hardship\r\nthan ever. Farmers had to borrow money and seed-rice from local\r\nofficials or Buddhist temples, hypothecating their land as security;\r\nthus the temples and the nobles extended their already great estates,\r\nwhilst the agricultural population gradually fell into a position of\r\npractical serfdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rise of the Fujiwara.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Fujiwara family were steadily developing their influence\r\nin Kioto. Their methods were simple but thoroughly effective. \"By\r\nprogressive exercises of arbitrariness they gradually contrived that the\r\nchoice of a consort for the sovereign should be legally limited to a\r\ndaughter of their family, five branches of which were specially\r\ndesignated to that honour through all ages. When a son was born to an\r\nemperor, the Fujiwara took the child into one of their palaces, and on\r\nhis accession to the throne, the particular Fujiwara noble that happened\r\nto be his maternal grandfather became regent of the empire. This office\r\nof regent, created towards the close of the 9th century, was part of the\r\nscheme; for the Fujiwara did not allow the purple to be worn by a\r\nsovereign after he had attained his majority, or, if they suffered him\r\nto wield the sceptre during a few years of manhood, they compelled him\r\nto abdicate so soon as any independent aspirations began to impair his\r\ndocility; and since for the purposes of administration in these\r\nconstantly recurring minorities an office more powerful than that of\r\nprime minister (dajo daijin) was needed, they created that of regent\r\n(kwambaku), making it hereditary in their own family. In fact the\r\nhistory of Japan from the 9th to the 19th century may be described as\r\nthe history of four families, the Fujiwara, the Taira, the Minamoto and\r\nthe Tokugawa. The Fujiwara governed through the emperor; the Taira, the\r\nMinamoto and the Tokugawa governed in spite of the emperor. The Fujiwara\r\nbased their power on matrimonial alliances with the Throne; the Taira,\r\nthe Minamoto and the Tokugawa based theirs on the possession of armed\r\nstrength which the throne had no competence to control. There another\r\nbroad line of cleavage is seen. Throughout the Fujiwara era the centre\r\nof political gravity remained always in the court. Throughout the era of\r\nthe Taira, the Minamoto and the Tokugawa the centre of political gravity\r\nwas transferred to a point outside the court, the headquarters of a\r\nmilitary feudalism.\" The process of transfer was of course gradual. It\r\ncommenced with the granting of large tracts of tax-free lands to\r\nnoblemen who had wrested them from the aborigines (Yemishi) or had\r\nreclaimed them by means of serf-labour. These tracts lay for the most\r\npart in the northern and eastern parts of the main island, at such a\r\ndistance from the Capital that the writ of the central government did\r\nnot run there; and since such lands could be rented at rates\r\nconsiderably less than the tax levied on farms belonging to the state,\r\nthe peasants by degrees abandoned the latter and settled on the former,\r\nwith the result that the revenues of the Throne steadily diminished,\r\nwhile those of the provincial magnates correspondingly increased.\r\nMoreover, in the 7th century, at the time of the adoption of Chinese\r\nmodels of administration and organization, the court began to rely for\r\nmilitary protection on the services of guards temporarily drafted from\r\nthe provincial troops, and, during the protracted struggle against the\r\nYemishi in the north and east in the 8th century, the fact that the\r\npower of the sword lay with the provinces began to be noted.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Taira and the Minamoto.\r\n\r\nKioto remained the source of authority. But with the growth of luxury\r\nand effeminacy in the capital the Fujiwara became more and more averse\r\nfrom the hardships of campaigning, and in the 9th and 10th centuries,\r\nrespectively, the Taira and the Minamoto[1] families came into\r\nprominence as military leaders, the field of the Taira operations being\r\nthe south and west, that of the Minamoto the north and east. Had the\r\ncourt reserved to itself and munificently exercised the privilege of\r\nrewarding these services, it might still have retained power and wealth.\r\nBut by a niggardly and contemptuous policy on the part of Kioto not only\r\nwere the Minamoto leaders estranged but also they assumed the right of\r\nrecompensing their followers with tax-free estates, an example which the\r\nTaira leaders quickly followed. By the early years of the 12th century\r\nthese estates had attracted the great majority of the farming class,\r\nwhereas the public land was left wild and uncultivated. In a word, the\r\ncourt and the Fujiwara found themselves without revenue, while the\r\ncoffers of the Taira and the Minamoto were full: the power of the purse\r\nand the power of the sword had passed effectually to the two military\r\nfamilies. Prominent features of the moral condition of the capital at\r\nthis era (12th century) were superstition, refinement and effeminacy. A\r\nbelief was widely held that calamity could not be averted or success\r\ninsured without recourse to Buddhist priests. Thus, during a reign of\r\nonly 13 years at the close of the 11th century, the emperor Shirakawa\r\ncaused 5420 religious pictures to be painted, ordered the casting of 127\r\nstatues of Buddha, each 11 ft. high, of 3150 life-sized images and of\r\n2930 smaller idols, and constructed 21 large temples as well as 446,630\r\nreligious edifices of various kinds. Side by side with this faith in the\r\nsupernatural, sexual immorality prevailed widely, never accompanied,\r\nhowever, by immodesty. Literary proficiency ranked as the be-all and\r\nend-all of existence. \"A man estimated the conjugal qualities of a young\r\nlady by her skill in finding scholarly similes and by her perception of\r\nthe cadence of words. If a woman was so fortunate as to acquire a\r\nreputation for learning, she possessed a certificate of universal virtue\r\nand amiability.\" All the pastimes of the Nara epoch were pursued with\r\nincreased fervour and elaboration in the Heian (Kioto) era. The building\r\nof fine dwelling-houses and the laying out of landscape gardens took\r\nplace on a considerable scale, though in these respects the ideals of\r\nlater ages were not yet reached. As to costume, the close-fitting,\r\nbusiness-like and comparatively simple dress of the 8th century was\r\nexchanged for a much more elaborate style. During the Nara epoch the\r\nmany-hued hats of China had been abandoned for a sober head-gear of silk\r\ngauze covered with black lacquer, but in the Heian era this was replaced\r\nby an imposing structure glistening with jewels: the sleeves of the\r\ntunic grew so long that they hung to the knees when a man's arms were\r\ncrossed, and the trowsers were made so full and baggy that they\r\nresembled a divided skirt. From this era may be said to have commenced\r\nthe manufacture of the tasteful and gorgeous textile fabrics for which\r\nJapan afterwards became famous. \"A fop's ideal was to wear several\r\nsuits, one above the other, disposing them so that their various colours\r\nshowed in harmoniously contrasting lines at the folds on the bosom and\r\nat the edges of the long sleeves. A successful costume created a\r\nsensation in court circles. Its wearer became the hero of the hour, and\r\nunder the pernicious influence of such ambition men began even to powder\r\ntheir faces and rouge their cheeks like women. As for the fair sex,\r\ntheir costume reached the acme of unpracticality and extravagance in\r\nthis epoch. Long flowing hair was essential, and what with developing\r\nthe volume and multiplying the number of her robes, and wearing above\r\nher trowsers a many-plied train, a grand lady of the time always seemed\r\nto be struggling to emerge from a cataract of habiliments.\" It was\r\nfortunate for Japan that circumstances favoured the growth of a military\r\nclass in this age of her career, for had the conditions existing in\r\nKioto during the Heian epoch spread throughout the whole country, the\r\npenalty never escaped by a demoralized nation must have overtaken her.\r\nBut by the middle of the 12th century the pernicious influence of the\r\nFujiwara had paled before that of the Taira and the Minamoto, and a\r\nquestion of succession to the throne marshalled the latter two families\r\nin opposite camps, thus inaugurating an era of civil war which held the\r\ncountry in the throes of almost continuous battle for 450 years, placed\r\nit under the administration of a military feudalism, and educated a\r\nnation of warriors. At first the Minamoto were vanquished and driven\r\nfrom the capital, Kiyomori, the Taira chief, being left complete master\r\nof the situation. He established his headquarters at Rokuharu, in Kioto,\r\nappropriated the revenues of 30 out of the 66 provinces forming the\r\nempire, and filled all the high offices of state with his own relatives\r\nor connexions. But he made no radical change in the administrative\r\nsystem, preferring to follow the example of the Fujiwara by keeping the\r\nthrone in the hands of minors. And he committed the blunder of sparing\r\nthe lives of two youthful sons of his defeated rival, the Minamoto\r\nchief. They were Yoritomo and Yoshitsune; the latter the greatest\r\nstrategist Japan ever produced, with perhaps one exception; the former,\r\none of her three greatest statesmen, the founder of military feudalism.\r\nBy these two men the Taira were so completely overthrown that they never\r\nraised their heads again, a sea-fight at Dan-no-ura (1155) giving them\r\nthe _coup de grâce_. Their supremacy had lasted 22 years.\r\n\r\n_The Feudal Era._--Yoritomo, acting largely under the advice of an\r\nastute counsellor, Oye no Hiromoto, established his seat of power at\r\nKamakura, 300 m. from Kioto. He saw that, effectively to utilize the\r\nstrength of the military class, propinquity to the military centres in\r\nthe provinces was essential. At Kamakura he organized an administrative\r\nbody similar in mechanism to that of the metropolitan government but\r\nstudiously differentiated in the matter of nomenclature. As to the\r\ncountry at large, he brought it effectually under the sway of Kamakura\r\nby placing the provinces under the direct control of military governors,\r\nchosen and appointed by himself. No attempt was made, however, to\r\ninterfere in any way with the polity in Kioto: it was left intact, and\r\nthe nobles about the Throne--_kuge_ (courtly houses), as they came to be\r\ncalled in contradistinction to the _buke_ (military houses)--were\r\nplacated by renewal of their property titles. The Buddhist priests,\r\nalso, who had been treated most harshly during the Taira tenure of\r\npower, found their fortunes restored under Kamakura's sway. Subsequently\r\nYoritomo obtained for himself the title of _sei-itai-shogun_\r\n(barbarian-subduing generalissimo), and just as the office of regent\r\n(kwambaku) had long been hereditary in the Fujiwara family, so the\r\noffice of shogun became thenceforth hereditary in that of the Minamoto.\r\nThese changes were radical. They signified a complete shifting of the\r\ncentre of power. During eighteen centuries from the time of Jimmu's\r\ninvasion--as Japanese historians reckon--the country had been ruled from\r\nthe south; now the north became supreme, and for a civilian\r\nadministration a purely military was substituted. But there was no\r\ncontumely towards the court in Kioto. Kamakura made a show of seeking\r\nImperial sanction for every one of its acts, and the whole of the\r\nmilitary administration was carried on in the name of the emperor by a\r\nshogun who called himself the Imperial deputy. In this respect things\r\nchanged materially after the death of Yoritomo (1198). Kamakura then\r\nbecame the scene of a drama analogous to that acted in Kioto from the\r\n10th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rule of the Hojo.\r\n\r\nThe Hojo family, to which belonged Masa, Yoritomo's consort, assumed\r\ntowards the Kamakura shogun an attitude similar to that previously\r\nassumed by the Fujiwara family towards the emperor in Kioto. A child,\r\nwho on state occasions was carried to the council chamber in Masa's\r\narms, served as the nominal repository of the shogun's power, the\r\nfunctions of administration being discharged in reality by the Hojo\r\nfamily, whose successive heads took the name of _shikken_ (constable).\r\nAt first care was taken to have the shogun's office filled by a near\r\nrelative of Yoritomo; but after the death of that great statesman's two\r\nsons and his nephew, the puppet shoguns were taken from the ranks of the\r\nFujiwara or of the Imperial princes, and were deposed so soon as they\r\nattempted to assert themselves. What this meant becomes apparent when we\r\nnote that in the interval of 83 years between 1220 and 1308, there were\r\nsix shoguns whose ages at the time of appointment ranged from 3 to 16.\r\nWhether, if events had not forced their hands, the Hojo constables would\r\nhave maintained towards the Throne the reverent demeanour adopted by\r\nYoritomo must remain a matter of conjecture. What actually happened was\r\nthat the ex-emperor, Go-Toba, made an ill-judged attempt (1221) to break\r\nthe power of Kamakura. He issued a call to arms which was responded to\r\nby some thousands of cenobites and as many soldiers of Taira extraction.\r\nIn the brief struggle that ensued the Imperial partisans were wholly\r\nshattered, and the direct consequences were the dethronement and exile\r\nof the reigning emperor, the banishment of his predecessor together with\r\ntwo princes of the blood, and the compulsory adoption of the tonsure by\r\nGo-Toba; while the indirect consequence was that the succession to the\r\nthrone and the tenure of Imperial power fell under the dictation of the\r\nHojo as they had formerly fallen under the direction of the Fujiwara.\r\nYoshitoki, then head of the Hojo family, installed his brother,\r\nTokifusa, as military governor of Kioto, and confiscating about 3000\r\nestates, the property of those who had espoused the Imperial cause,\r\ndistributed these lands among the adherents of his own family, thus\r\ngreatly strengthening the basis of the feudal system. \"It fared with\r\nthe Hojo as it had fared with all the great families that preceded them:\r\ntheir own misrule ultimately wrought their ruin. Their first eight\r\nrepresentatives were talented and upright administrators. They took\r\njustice, simplicity and truth for guiding principles; they despised\r\nluxury and pomp; they never aspired to high official rank; they were\r\ncontent with two provinces for estates, and they sternly repelled the\r\neffeminate, depraved customs of Kioto.\" Thus the greater part of the\r\n13th century was, on the whole, a golden era for Japan, and the lower\r\norders learned to welcome feudalism. Nevertheless no century furnished\r\nmore conspicuous illustrations of the peculiarly Japanese system of\r\nvicarious government. Children occupied the position of shogun in\r\nKamakura under authority emanating from children on the throne in Kioto;\r\nand members of the Hojo family as shikken administered affairs at the\r\nmandate of the child shoguns. Through all three stages in the dignities\r\nof mikado, shogun and shikken, the strictly regulated principle of\r\nheredity was maintained, according to which no Hojo shikken could ever\r\nbecome shogun; no Minamoto or Fujiwara could occupy the throne. At the\r\nbeginning of the 14th century, however, several causes combined to shake\r\nthe supremacy of the Hojo. Under the sway of the ninth shikken\r\n(Takatoki), the austere simplicity of life and earnest discharge of\r\nexecutive duties which had distinguished the early chiefs of the family\r\nwere exchanged for luxury, debauchery and perfunctory government. Thus\r\nthe management of fiscal affairs fell into the hands of Takasuke, a man\r\nof usurious instincts. It had been the wise custom of the Hojo\r\nconstables to store grain in seasons of plenty, and distribute it at low\r\nprices in times of dearth. There occurred at this epoch a succession of\r\nbad harvests, but instead of opening the state granaries with benevolent\r\nliberality, Takasuke sold their contents at the highest obtainable\r\nrates; and, by way of contrast to the prevailing indigence, the people\r\nsaw the constable in Kamakura affecting the pomp and extravagance of a\r\nsovereign waited upon by 37 mistresses, supporting a band of 2000\r\ndancers, and keeping a pack of 5000 fighting dogs. The throne happened\r\nto be then occupied (1310-1338) by an emperor, Go-Daigo, who had reached\r\nfull maturity before his accession, and was correspondingly averse from\r\nacting the puppet part assigned to the sovereigns of his time. Female\r\ninfluence contributed to his impatience. One of his concubines bore a\r\nson for whom he sought to obtain nomination as prince imperial, in\r\ndefiance of an arrangement made by the Hojo that the succession should\r\npass alternately to the senior and junior branches of the Imperial\r\nfamily. Kamakura refused to entertain Go-Daigo's project, and\r\nthenceforth the child's mother importuned her sovereign and lover to\r\noverthrow the Hojo. The _entourage_ of the throne in Kioto at this time\r\nwas a counterpart of former eras. The Fujiwara, indeed, wielded nothing\r\nof their ancient influence. They had been divided by the Hojo into five\r\nbranches, each endowed with an equal right to the office of regent, and\r\ntheir strength was thus dissipated in struggling among themselves for\r\nthe possession of the prize. But what the Fujiwara had done in their\r\ndays of greatness, what the Taira had done during their brief tenure of\r\npower, the Saionji were now doing, namely, aspiring to furnish prime\r\nministers and empresses from their own family solely. They had already\r\ngiven consorts to five emperors in succession, and jealous rivals were\r\nwatching keenly to attack this clan which threatened to usurp the place\r\nlong held by the most illustrious family in the land. A petty incident\r\ndisturbed this state of very tender equilibrium before the plan of the\r\nHojo's enemies had fully matured, and the emperor presently found\r\nhimself an exile on the island of Oki. But there now appeared upon the\r\nscene three men of great prowess: Kusunoki Masashige, Nitta Yoshisada\r\nand Ashikaga Takauji. The first espoused from the outset the cause of\r\nthe Throne and, though commanding only a small force, held the Hojo\r\ntroops in check. The last two were both of Minamoto descent. Their\r\ncommon ancestor was Minamoto Yoshiiye, whose exploits against the\r\nnorthern Yemishi in the second half of the 11th century had so impressed\r\nhis countrymen that they gave him the title of Hachiman Taro\r\n(first-born of the god of war). Both men took the field originally in\r\nthe cause of the Hojo, but at heart they desired to be avenged upon the\r\nlatter for disloyalty to the Minamoto. Nitta Yoshisada marched suddenly\r\nagainst Kamakura, carried it by storm and committed the city to the\r\nflames. Ashikaga Takauji occupied Kioto, and with the suicide of\r\nTakatoki the Hojo fell finally from rule after 115 years of supremacy\r\n(1219-1334). The emperor now returned from exile, and his son, Prince\r\nMoriyoshi, having been appointed to the office of shogun at Kamakura,\r\nthe restoration of the administrative power to the Throne seemed an\r\naccomplished fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Ashikaga Shoguns.\r\n\r\nGo-Daigo, however, was not in any sense a wise sovereign. The\r\nextermination of the Hojo placed wide estates at his disposal, but\r\ninstead of rewarding those who had deserved well of him, he used a great\r\npart of them to enrich his favourites, the companions of his\r\ndissipation. Ashikaga Takauji sought just such an opportunity. The\r\nfollowing year (1335) saw him proclaiming himself shogun at Kamakura,\r\nand after a complicated pageant of incidents, the emperor Go-Daigo was\r\nobliged once more to fly from Kioto. He carried the regalia with him,\r\nrefused to submit to Takauji, and declined to recognize his usurped\r\ntitle of shogun. The Ashikaga chief solved the situation by deposing\r\nGo-Daigo and placing upon the throne another scion of the imperial\r\nfamily who is known in history as Komyo (1336-1348), and who, of course,\r\nconfirmed Takauji in the office of shogun. Thus commenced the Ashikaga\r\nline of shoguns, and thus commenced also a fifty-six-year period of\r\ndivided sovereignty, the emperor Go-Daigo and his descendants reigning\r\nin Yoshino as the southern court (_nancho_), and the emperor Komyo and\r\nhis descendants reigning in Kioto as the northern court (_hokucho_). It\r\nwas by the efforts of the shogun Yoshimitsu, one of the greatest of the\r\nAshikaga potentates, that this quarrel was finally composed, but during\r\nits progress the country had fallen into a deplorable condition. \"The\r\nconstitutional powers had become completely disorganized, especially in\r\nregions at a distance from the chief towns. The peasant was\r\nimpoverished, his spirit broken, his hope of better things completely\r\ngone. He dreamed away his miserable existence and left the fields\r\nuntilled. Bands of robbers followed the armies through the interior of\r\nthe country, and increased the feeling of lawlessness and insecurity.\r\nThe coast population, especially that of the island of Kiushiu, had\r\ngiven itself up in a great measure to piracy. Even on the shores of\r\nKorea and China these enterprising Japanese corsairs made their\r\nappearance.\" The shogun Yoshimitsu checked piracy, and there ensued\r\nbetween Japan and China a renewal of cordial intercourse which, upon the\r\npart of the shogun, developed phases plainly suggesting an admission of\r\nChinese suzerainty.\r\n\r\nFor a brief moment during the sway of Yoshimitsu the country had rest\r\nfrom internecine war, but immediately after his death (1394) the\r\nstruggle began afresh. Many of the great territorial lords had now grown\r\ntoo puissant to concern themselves about either mikado or shogun. Each\r\nfought for his own hand, thinking only of extending his sway and his\r\nterritories. By the middle of the 16th century Kioto was in ruins, and\r\nlittle vitality remained in any trade or industry except those that\r\nministered to the wants of the warrior. Again in the case of the\r\nAshikaga shoguns the political tendency to exercise power vicariously\r\nwas shown, as it had been shown in the case of the mikados in Kioto and\r\nin the case of the Minamoto in Kamakura. What the regents had been to\r\nthe emperors and the constables to the Minamoto shoguns, that the\r\nwardens (_kwanryo_) were to the Ashikaga shoguns. Therefore, for\r\npossession of this office of kwanryo vehement conflicts were waged, and\r\nat one time five rival shoguns were used as figure-heads by contending\r\nfactions. Yoshimitsu had apportioned an ample allowance for the support\r\nof the Imperial court, but in the continuous warfare following his death\r\nthe estates charged with the duty of paying this allowance ceased to\r\nreturn any revenue; the court nobles had to seek shelter and sustenance\r\nwith one or other of the feudal chiefs in the provinces, and the court\r\nitself was reduced to such a state of indigence that when the emperor\r\nGo-Tsuchi died (1500), his corpse lay for forty days awaiting burial,\r\nno funds being available for purposes of sepulture.\r\n\r\nAlone among the vicissitudes of these troublous times the strength and\r\ninfluence of Buddhism grew steadily. The great monasteries were military\r\nstrongholds as well as places of worship. When the emperor Kwammu chose\r\nKioto for his capital, he established on the hill of Hiyei-zan, which\r\nlay north-east of the city, a magnificent temple to ward off the evil\r\ninfluences supposed to emanate from that quarter. Twenty years later,\r\nKobo, the most famous of all Japanese Buddhist saints, founded on\r\nKoyasan in Yamato a monastery not less important than that of Hiyei-zan.\r\nThese and many other temples had large tax-free estates, and for the\r\nprotection of their property they found it expedient to train and arm\r\nthe cenobites as soldiers. From that to taking active part in the\r\npolitical struggles of the time was but a short step, especially as the\r\ngreat temples often became refuges of sovereigns and princes who, though\r\nnominally forsaking the world, retained all their interest, and even\r\ncontinued to take an active part, in its vicissitudes. It is recorded of\r\nthe emperor Shirakawa (1073-1086) that the three things which he\r\ndeclared his total inability to control were the waters of the river\r\nKamo, the fall of the dice, and the monks of Buddha. His successors\r\nmight have confessed equal inability. Kiyomori, the puissant chief of\r\nthe Taira family, had fruitlessly essayed to defy the Buddhists;\r\nYoritomo, in the hour of his most signal triumph, thought it wise to\r\nplacate them. Where these representatives of centralized power found\r\nthemselves impotent, it may well be supposed that the comparatively\r\npetty chieftains who fought each for his own hand in the 15th and 16th\r\ncenturies were incapable of accomplishing anything. In fact, the task of\r\ncentralizing the administrative power, and thus restoring peace and\r\norder to the distracted empire, seemed, at the middle of the 16th\r\ncentury, a task beyond achievement by human capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Nobunaga, Hideyoshi and Iyeyasu.\r\n\r\nBut if ever events create the men to deal with them, such was the case\r\nin the second half of that century. Three of the greatest captains and\r\nstatesmen in Japanese history appeared upon the stage simultaneously,\r\nand moreover worked in union, an event altogether inconsistent with the\r\nnature of the age. They were Oda Nobunaga, Hideyoshi (the _taiko_) and\r\nTokugawa Iyeyasu. Nobunaga belonged to the Taira family and was\r\noriginally ruler of a small fief in the province of Owari. Iyeyasu, a\r\nsub-feudatory of Nobunaga's enemy, the powerful daimyo[2] of Mikawa and\r\ntwo other provinces, was a scion of the Minamoto and therefore eligible\r\nfor the shogunate. Hideyoshi was a peasant's son, equally lacking in\r\npatrons and in personal attractions. No chance seemed more remote than\r\nthat such men, above all Hideyoshi, could possibly rise to supreme\r\npower. On the other hand, one outcome of the commotion with which the\r\ncountry had seethed for more than four centuries was to give special\r\neffect to the principle of natural selection. The fittest alone\r\nsurviving, the qualities that made for fitness came to take precedence\r\nof rank or station, and those qualities were prowess in the battlefield\r\nand wisdom in the statesman's closet. \"Any plebeian that would prove\r\nhimself a first-class fighting man was willingly received into the armed\r\n_comitatus_ which every feudal potentate was eager to attach to himself\r\nand his flag.\" It was thus that Hideyoshi was originally enrolled in the\r\nranks of Nobunaga's retainers.\r\n\r\nNobunaga, succeeding to his small fief in Owari in 1542, added to it six\r\nwhole provinces within 25 years of continuous endeavour. Being finally\r\ninvited by the emperor to undertake the pacification of the country, and\r\nappealed to by Yoshiaki, the last of the Ashikaga chiefs, to secure for\r\nhim the shogunate, he marched into Kioto at the head of a powerful army\r\n(1568), and, having accomplished the latter purpose, was preparing to\r\ncomplete the former when he fell under the sword of a traitor.\r\nThroughout his brilliant career he had the invaluable assistance of\r\nHideyoshi, who would have attained immortal fame on any stage in any\r\nera. Hideyoshi entered Nobunaga's service as a groom and ended by\r\nadministering the whole empire. When he accompanied Nobunaga to Kioto\r\nin obedience to the invitation of the mikado, Okimachi, order and\r\ntranquillity were quickly restored in the capital and its vicinity. But\r\nto extend this blessing to the whole country, four powerful daimyos as\r\nwell as the militant monks had still to be dealt with. The monks had\r\nfrom the outset sheltered and succoured Nobunaga's enemies, and one\r\ngreat prelate, Kenryo, hierarch of the Monto sect, whose headquarters\r\nwere at Osaka, was believed to aspire to the throne itself. In 1571\r\nNobunaga attacked and gave to the flames the celebrated monastery of\r\nHiyei-zan, established nearly eight centuries previously; and in 1580 he\r\nwould have similarly served the splendid temple Hongwan-ji in Osaka, had\r\nnot the mikado sought and obtained grace for it. The task then remained\r\nof subduing four powerful daimyos, three in the south and one in the\r\nnorth-east, who continued to follow the bent of their own warlike\r\nambitions without paying the least attention to either sovereign or\r\nshogun. The task was commenced by sending an army under Hideyoshi\r\nagainst Mori of Choshu, whose fief lay on the northern shore of the\r\nShimonoseki strait. This proved to be the last enterprise planned by\r\nNobunaga. On a morning in June 1582 one of the corps intended to\r\nreinforce Hideyoshi's army marched out of Kameyama under the command of\r\nAkechi Mitsuhide, who either harboured a personal grudge against\r\nNobunaga or was swayed by blind ambition. Mitsuhide suddenly changed the\r\nroute of his troops, led them to Kioto, and attacked the temple Honno-ji\r\nwhere Nobunaga was sojourning all unsuspicious of treachery. Rescue and\r\nresistance being alike hopeless, the great soldier committed suicide.\r\nThirteen days later, Hideyoshi, having concluded peace with Mori of\r\nChoshu, fell upon Mitsuhide's forces and shattered them, Mitsuhide\r\nhimself being killed by a peasant as he fled from the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hideyoshi.\r\n\r\nNobunaga's removal at once made Hideyoshi the most conspicuous figure in\r\nthe empire, the only man with any claim to dispute that title being\r\nTokugawa Iyeyasu. These two had hitherto worked in concert. But the\r\nquestion of the succession to Nobunaga's estates threw the country once\r\nmore into tumult. He left two grown-up sons and a baby grandson, whose\r\nfather, Nobunaga's first-born, had perished in the holocaust at\r\nHonno-ji. Hideyoshi, not unmindful, it may be assumed, of the privileges\r\nof a guardian, espoused the cause of the infant, and wrested from\r\nNobunaga's three other great captains a reluctant endorsement of his\r\nchoice. Nobutaka, third son of Nobunaga, at once drew the sword, which\r\nhe presently had to turn against his own person; two years later (1584),\r\nhis elder brother, Nobuo, took the field under the aegis of Tokugawa\r\nIyeyasu. Hideyoshi and Iyeyasu, now pitted against each other for the\r\nfirst time, were found to be of equal prowess, and being too wise to\r\nprolong a useless war, they reverted to their old alliance, subsequently\r\nconfirming it by a family union, the son of Iyeyasu being adopted by\r\nHideyoshi and the latter's daughter being given in marriage to Iyeyasu.\r\nHideyoshi had now been invested by the mikado with the post of regent,\r\nand his position in the capital was omnipotent. He organized in Kioto a\r\nmagnificent pageant, in which the principal figures were himself,\r\nIyeyasu, Nobuo and twenty-seven daimyos. The emperor was present.\r\nHideyoshi sat on the right of the throne, and all the nobles did\r\nobeisance to the sovereign. Prior to this event Hideyoshi had conducted\r\nagainst the still defiant daimyos of Kiushiu, especially Shimazu of\r\nSatsuma, the greatest army ever massed by any Japanese general, and had\r\nreduced the island of the nine provinces, not by weight of armament\r\nonly, but also by a signal exercise of the wise clemency which\r\ndistinguished him from all the statesmen of his era.\r\n\r\nThe whole of Japan was now under Hideyoshi's sway except the fiefs in\r\nthe extreme north and those in the region known as the Kwanto, namely,\r\nthe eight provinces forming the eastern elbow of the main island. Seven\r\nof these provinces were virtually under the sway of Hojo Ujimasa, fourth\r\nrepresentative of a family established in 1476 by a brilliant adventurer\r\nof Ise, not related in any way to the great but then extinct house of\r\nKamakura Hojos. The daimyos in the north were comparatively powerless to\r\nresist Hideyoshi, but to reach them the Kwanto had to be reduced, and\r\nnot only was its chief, Ujimasa, a formidable foe, but also the\r\ntopographical features of the district represented fortifications of\r\nimmense strength. After various unsuccessful overtures, having for their\r\npurpose to induce Ujimasa to visit the capital and pay homage to the\r\nemperor, Hideyoshi marched from Kioto in the spring of 1590 at the head\r\nof 170,000 men, his colleagues Nobuo and Iyeyasu having under their\r\norders 80,000 more. The campaign ended as did all Hideyoshi's\r\nenterprises, except that he treated his vanquished enemies with unusual\r\nseverity. During the three months spent investing Odawara, the northern\r\ndaimyos surrendered, and thus the autumn of 1590 saw Hideyoshi master of\r\nJapan from end to end, and saw Tokugawa Iyeyasu established at Yedo as\r\nrecognized ruler of the eight provinces of the Kwanto. These two facts\r\nshould be bracketed together, because Japan's emergence from the deep\r\ngloom of long-continued civil strife was due not more to the brilliant\r\nqualities of Hideyoshi and Iyeyasu individually than to the fortunate\r\nsynchronism of their careers, so that the one was able to carry the\r\nother's work to completion and permanence. The last eight years of\r\nHideyoshi's life--he died in 1598--were chiefly remarkable for his\r\nattempt to invade China through Korea, and for his attitude towards\r\nChristianity (see § VIII.: FOREIGN INTERCOURSE).\r\n\r\n_The Tokugawa Era._--When Hideyoshi died he left a son, Hideyori, then\r\nonly six years of age, and the problem of this child's future had\r\nnaturally caused supreme solicitude to the peasant statesman. He finally\r\nentrusted the care of the boy and the management of state affairs to\r\nfive regents, five ministers, and three intermediary councillors. But he\r\nplaced chief reliance upon Iyeyasu, whom he appointed president of the\r\nboard of regents. Among the latter was one, Ishida Mitsunari, who to\r\ninsatiable ambition added an extraordinary faculty for intrigue and\r\ngreat personal magnetism. These qualities he utilized with such success\r\nthat the dissensions among the daimyos, which had been temporarily\r\ncomposed by Hideyoshi, broke out again, and the year 1600 saw Japan\r\ndivided into two camps, one composed of Tokugawa Iyeyasu and his allies,\r\nthe other of Ishida Mitsunari and his partisans.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Iyeyasu.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Iyeyasu was eminently perilous. From his position in\r\nthe east of the country, he found himself menaced by two powerful\r\nenemies on the north and on the south, respectively, the former barely\r\ncontained by a greatly weaker force of his friends, and the latter\r\nmoving up in seemingly overwhelming strength from Kioto. He decided to\r\nhurl himself upon the southern army without awaiting the result of the\r\nconflict in the north. The encounter took place at Sekigahara in the\r\nprovince of Mino on the 21st of October 1600. The army of Iyeyasu had to\r\nmove to the attack in such a manner that its left flank and its left\r\nrear were threatened by divisions of the enemy posted on commanding\r\neminences. But with the leaders of these divisions Iyeyasu had come to\r\nan understanding by which they could be trusted to abide so long as\r\nvictory did not declare against him. Such incidents were naturally\r\ncommon in an era when every man fought for his own hand. The southerners\r\nsuffered a crushing defeat. The survivors fled pell-mell to Osaka, where\r\nin a colossal fortress, built by Hideyoshi, his son, Hideyori, and the\r\nlatter's mother, Yodo, were sheltered behind ramparts held by 80,000\r\nmen. Hideyori's cause had been openly put forward by Ishida Mitsunari\r\nand his partisans, but Iyeyasu made no immediate attempt to visit the\r\nsin upon the head of his deceased benefactor's child. On the contrary,\r\nhe sent word to the lady Yodo and her little boy that he absolved them\r\nof all complicity. The battle of Sekigahara is commonly spoken of as\r\nhaving terminated the civil war which had devastated Japan, with brief\r\nintervals, from the latter half of the 12th century to the beginning of\r\nthe 17th. That is incorrect in view of the fact that Sekigahara was\r\nfollowed by other fighting, especially by the terrible conflict at Osaka\r\nin 1615 when Yodo and her son perished. But Sekigahara's importance\r\ncannot be over-rated. For had Iyeyasu been finally crushed there, the\r\nwave of internecine strife must have rolled again over the empire until\r\nprovidence provided another Hideyoshi and another Iyeyasu to stem it.\r\nSekigahara, therefore, may be truly described as a turning-point in\r\nJapan's career and as one of the decisive battles of the world. As for\r\nthe fact that the Tokugawa leader did not at once proceed to extremities\r\nin the case of the boy Hideyori, though the events of the Sekigahara\r\ncampaign had made it quite plain that such a course would ultimately be\r\ninevitable, we have to remember that only two years had elapsed since\r\nHideyoshi was laid in his grave. His memory was still green and the\r\nglory of his achievements still enveloped his family. Iyeyasu foresaw\r\nthat to carry the tragedy to its bitter end at once must have forced\r\ninto Hideyori's camp many puissant daimyos whose sense of allegiance\r\nwould grow less cogent with the lapse of time. When he did lay siege to\r\nthe Osaka castle in 1615, the power of the Tokugawa was well-nigh\r\nshattered against its ramparts; had not the onset been aided by\r\ntreachery, the stronghold would probably have proved impregnable.\r\n\r\nBut signal as were the triumphs of the Tokugawa chieftain in the field,\r\nwhat distinguishes him from all his predecessors is the ability he\r\ndisplayed in consolidating his conquests. The immense estates that fell\r\ninto his hands he parcelled out in such a manner that all important\r\nstrategical positions were held by daimyos whose fidelity could be\r\nconfidently trusted, and every feudatory of doubtful loyalty found his\r\nfief within touch of a Tokugawa partisan. This arrangement, supplemented\r\nby a system which required all the great daimyos to have mansions in the\r\nshogun's capital. Yedo, to keep their families there always and to\r\nreside there themselves in alternate years, proved so potent a check to\r\ndisaffection that from 1615, when the castle of Osaka fell, until 1864,\r\nwhen the Choshu ronin attacked Kioto, Japan remained entirely free from\r\ncivil war.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to form a clear idea of the ethical and administrative\r\nprinciples by which Iyeyasu and the early Tokugawa chiefs were guided in\r\nelaborating the system which gave to Japan an unprecedented era of peace\r\nand prosperity. Evidence is furnished not only by the system itself but\r\nalso by the contents of a document generally called the _Testament of\r\nIyeyasu_, though probably it was not fully compiled until the time of\r\nhis grandson, Iyemitsu (1623-1650). The great Tokugawa chief, though he\r\nmunificently patronized Buddhism and though he carried constantly in his\r\nbosom a miniature Buddhist image to which he ascribed all his success in\r\nthe field and his safety in battle, took his ethical code from\r\nConfucius. He held that the basis of all legislation and administration\r\nshould be the five relations of sovereign and subject, parent and child,\r\nhusband and wife, brother and sister, friend and friend. The family was,\r\nin his eyes, the essential foundation of society, to be maintained at\r\nall sacrifices. Beyond these broad outlines of moral duty it was not\r\ndeemed necessary to instruct the people. Therefore out of the hundred\r\nchapters forming the _Testament_ only 22 contain what can be called\r\nlegal enactments, while 55 relate to administration and politics; 16 set\r\nforth moral maxims and reflections, and the remainder record\r\nillustrative episodes in the career of the author. No distinct line is\r\ndrawn between law and morals, between the duty of a citizen and the\r\nvirtues of a member of a family. Substantive law is entirely wanting,\r\njust as it was wanting in the so-called constitution of Prince Shotoku.\r\nCustom, as sanctioned by public observance, must be complied with in the\r\ncivil affairs of life. What required minute exposition was criminal law,\r\nthe relations of social classes, etiquette, rank, precedence,\r\nadministration and government.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Social distinctions in the Tokugawa Era.\r\n\r\nSociety under feudalism had been moulded into three sharply defined\r\ngroups, namely, first, the Throne and the court nobles (_kuge_);\r\nsecondly, the military class (_buke_ or _samurai_); and thirdly, the\r\ncommon people (_heimin_). These lines of cleavage were emphasized as\r\nmuch as possible by the Tokugawa rulers. The divine origin of the mikado\r\nwas held to separate him from contact with mundane affairs, and he was\r\ntherefore strictly secluded in the palace at Kioto, his main function\r\nbeing to mediate between his heavenly ancestors and his subjects,\r\nentrusting to the shogun and the samurai the duty of transacting all\r\nworldly business on behalf of the state. In obedience to this principle\r\nthe mikado became a kind of sacrosanct abstraction. No one except his\r\nconsorts and his chief ministers ever saw his face. In the rare cases\r\nwhen he gave audience to a privileged subject, he sat behind a curtain,\r\nand when he went abroad, he rode in a closely shut car drawn by oxen. A\r\nrevenue of ten thousand _koku_ of rice--the equivalent of about as many\r\nguineas--was apportioned for his support, and the right was reserved to\r\nhim of conferring empty titles upon the living and rank upon the dead.\r\nHis majesty had one wife, the empress (_kogo_), necessarily taken from\r\none of the five chosen families (_go-sekke_) of the Fujiwara, but he\r\nmight also have twelve consorts, and if direct issue failed, the\r\nsuccession passed to one of the two princely families of Arisugawa and\r\nFushimi, adoption, however, being possible in the last resort. The\r\n_kuge_ constituted the court nobility, consisting of 155 families all of\r\nwhom traced their lineage to ancient mikados; they ranked far above the\r\nfeudal chiefs, not excepting even the shogun; filled by right of\r\nheredity nearly all the offices at the court, the emoluments attached\r\nbeing, however, a mere pittance; were entirely without the great estates\r\nwhich had belonged to them in ante-feudal times, and lived lives of\r\nproud poverty, occupying themselves with the study of literature and the\r\npractice of music and art. After the kuge and at a long distance below\r\nthem in theoretical rank came the military families, who, as a class,\r\nwere called _buke_ or _samurai_. They had hereditary revenues, and they\r\nfilled the administrative posts, these, too, being often hereditary. The\r\nthird, and by far the most numerous, section of the nation were the\r\ncommoners (_heimin_). They had no social status; were not allowed to\r\ncarry swords, and possessed no income except what they could earn with\r\ntheir hands. About 55 in every 1000 units of the nation were samurai,\r\nthe latter's wives and children being included in this estimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Daimyos.\r\n\r\nUnder the Hojo and the Ashikaga shoguns the holders of the great estates\r\nchanged frequently according to the vicissitudes of those troublesome\r\ntimes, but under the Tokugawa no change took place, and there thus grew\r\nup a landed nobility of the most permanent character. Every one of these\r\nestates was a feudal kingdom, large or small, with its own usages and\r\nits own laws, based on the general principles above indicated and liable\r\nto be judged according to those principles by the shogun's government\r\n(_baku-fu_) in Yedo. A daimyo or feudal chief drew from the peasants on\r\nhis estate the means of subsistence for himself and his retainers. For\r\nthis purpose the produce of his estate was assessed by the shogun's\r\nofficials in _koku_ (one _koku_ = 180.39 litres, worth about £1), and\r\nabout one-half of the assessed amount went to the feudatory, the other\r\nhalf to the tillers of the soil. The richest daimyo was Mayeda of Kaga,\r\nwhose fief was assessed at a little over a million _koku_, his revenue\r\nthus being about half a million sterling. Just as an empress had to be\r\ntaken from one of five families designated to that distinction for all\r\ntime, so a successor to the shogunate, failing direct heir, had to be\r\nselected from three families (_sanke_), namely, those of the daimyos of\r\nOwari, Kii and Mito, whose first representatives were three sons of\r\nIyeyasu. Out of the total body of 255 daimyos existing in the year 1862,\r\n141 were specially distinguished as _fudai_, or hereditary vassals of\r\nthe Tokugawa house, and to 18 of these was strictly limited the\r\nperpetual privilege of filling all the high offices in the Yedo\r\nadministration, while to 4 of them was reserved the special honour of\r\nsupplying a regent (_go-tairo_) during the minority of the shogun.\r\nMoreover, a _fudai_ daimyo was of necessity appointed to the command of\r\nthe fortress of Nijo in Kioto as well as of the great castles of Osaka\r\nand Fushimi, which Iyeyasu designated the keys of the country. No\r\nintermarriage might take place between members of the court nobility and\r\nthe feudal houses without the consent of Yedo; no daimyo might apply\r\ndirect to the emperor for an official title, or might put foot within\r\nthe imperial district of Kioto without the shogun's permit, and at all\r\nentrances to the region known as the Kwanto there were established\r\nguardhouses, where every one, of whatever rank, must submit to be\r\nexamined, in order to prevent the wives and children of the daimyos\r\nfrom secretly leaving Yedo for their own provinces. In their journeys to\r\nand from Yedo every second year the feudal chiefs had to travel by one\r\nof two great highways, the Tokaido or the Nakasendo, and as they moved\r\nwith great retinues, these roads were provided with a number of inns and\r\ntea-houses equipped in a sumptuous manner, and having an abundance of\r\nfemale servants. A puissant daimyo's procession often numbered as many\r\nas 1000 retainers, and nothing illustrates more forcibly the wide\r\ninterval that separated the soldier and the plebeian than the fact that\r\nat the appearance of the heralds who preceded these progresses all\r\ncommoners who happened to be abroad had to kneel on the ground with\r\nbowed and uncovered heads; all wayside houses had to close the shutters\r\nof windows giving on the road, and none might venture to look down from\r\na height on the passing magnate. Any violation of these rules of\r\netiquette exposed the violator to instant death at the hands of the\r\ndaimyo's retinue. Moreover, the samurai and the heimin lived strictly\r\napart. A feudal chief had a castle which generally occupied a commanding\r\nposition. It was surrounded by from one to three broad moats, the\r\ninnermost crowned with a high wall of huge cut stones, its trace\r\narranged so as to give flank defence, which was further provided by\r\npagoda-like towers placed at the salient angles. Inside this wall stood\r\nthe houses of the high officials on the outskirts of a park surrounding\r\nthe residence of the daimyo himself, and from the scarps of the moats or\r\nin the intervals between them rose houses for the military retainers,\r\nbarrack-like structures, provided, whenever possible, with small but\r\nartistically arranged and carefully tended gardens. All this domain of\r\nthe military was called _yashiki_ in distinction to the _machi_\r\n(streets) where the despised commoners had their habitat.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Samurai.\r\n\r\nThe general body of the samurai received stipends and lived frugally.\r\nTheir pay was not reckoned in money: it took the form of so many rations\r\nof rice delivered from their chief's granaries. A few had landed\r\nestates, usually bestowed in recognition of conspicuous merit. They were\r\nprobably the finest type of hereditary soldiers the world ever produced.\r\nMoney and all devices for earning it they profoundly despised. The right\r\nof wearing a sword was to them the highest conceivable privilege. They\r\ncounted themselves the guardians of their fiefs' honour and of their\r\ncountry's welfare. At any moment they were prepared cheerfully to\r\nsacrifice their lives on the altar of loyalty. Their word, once given,\r\nmust never be violated. The slightest insult to their honour might not\r\nbe condoned. Stoicism was a quality which they esteemed next to courage:\r\nall outward display of emotion must be suppressed. The sword might never\r\nbe drawn for a petty cause, but, if once drawn, must never be returned\r\nto its scabbard until it had done its duty. Martial exercises occupied\r\nmuch of their attention, but book learning also they esteemed highly.\r\nThey were profoundly courteous towards each other, profoundly\r\ncontemptuous towards the commoner, whatever his wealth. Filial piety\r\nranked next to loyalty in their code of ethics. Thus the Confucian\r\nmaxim, endorsed explicitly in the _Testament of Iyeyasu_, that a man\r\nmust not live under the same sky with his father's murderer or his\r\nbrother's slayer, received most literal obedience, and many instances\r\noccurred of vendettas pursued in the face of apparently insuperable\r\ndifficulties and consummated after years of effort. By the standard of\r\nmodern morality the Japanese samurai would be counted cruel. Holding\r\nthat death was the natural sequel of defeat and the only certain way of\r\navoiding disgrace, he did not seek quarter himself or think of extending\r\nit to an enemy. Yet in his treatment of the latter he loved to display\r\ncourtesy until the supreme moment when all considerations of mercy were\r\nlaid aside. It cannot be doubted that the practice of employing torture\r\njudicially tended to educate a mood of callousness towards suffering, or\r\nthat the many idle hours of a military man's life in time of peace\r\nencouraged a measure of dissipation. But there does not seem to be any\r\nvalid ground for concluding that either of these defects was conspicuous\r\nin the character of the Japanese samurai. Faithlessness towards women\r\nwas the greatest fault that can be laid to his door. The samurai lady\r\nclaimed no privilege of timidity on account of her sex. She knew how to\r\ndie in the cause of honour just as readily as her husband, her father or\r\nher brother died, and conjugal fidelity did not rank as a virtue in her\r\neyes, being regarded as a simple duty. But her husband held marital\r\nfaith in small esteem and ranked his wife far below his sword. It has to\r\nbe remembered that when we speak of a samurai's suicide, there is no\r\nquestion of poison, the bullet, drowning or any comparatively painless\r\nmanner of exit from the world. The invariable method was to cut open the\r\nabdomen (_hara-kiri_ or _seppuku_) and afterwards, if strength remained,\r\nthe sword was turned against the throat. To such endurance had the\r\nsamurai trained himself that he went through this cruel ordeal without\r\nflinching in the smallest degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Heimin.\r\n\r\nThe heimin or commoners were divided into three classes--husbandmen,\r\nartisans and traders. The farmer, as the nation lived by his labour, was\r\ncounted the most respectable among the bread-winners, and a cultivator\r\nof his own estate might even carry one sword but never two, that\r\nprivilege being strictly reserved to a samurai. The artisan, too,\r\nreceived much consideration, as is easily understood when we remember\r\nthat included in his ranks were artists, sword-smiths, armourers,\r\nsculptors of sacred images or sword-furniture, ceramists and lacquerers.\r\nMany artisans were in the permanent service of feudal chiefs from whom\r\nthey received fixed salaries. Tradesmen, however, were regarded with\r\ndisdain and stood lowest of all in the social organization. Too much\r\ndespised to be even included in that organization were the _eta_\r\n(defiled folks) and the _hinin_ (outcasts). The exact origin of these\r\nlatter pariahs is uncertain, but the ancestors of the eta would seem to\r\nhave been prisoners of war or the enslaved families of criminals. To\r\nsuch people were assigned the defiling duties of tending tombs,\r\ndisposing of the bodies of the dead, slaughtering animals or tanning\r\nhides. The hinin were mendicants. On them devolved the task of removing\r\nand burying the corpses of executed criminals. Living in segregated\r\nhamlets, forbidden to marry with heimin, still less with samurai, not\r\nallowed to eat, drink or associate with persons above their own class,\r\nthe eta remained under the ban of ostracism from generation to\r\ngeneration, though many of them contrived to amass much wealth. They\r\nwere governed by their own headmen, and they had three chiefs, one\r\nresiding in each of the cities of Yedo, Osaka and Kioto. All these\r\nmembers of the submerged classes were relieved from proscription and\r\nadmitted to the ranks of the commoners under the enlightened system of\r\nMeiji. The 12th of October 1871 saw their enfranchisement, and at that\r\ndate the census showed 287,111 eta and 695,689 hinin.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Decline and Fall of the Shogunate.\r\n\r\nNaturally, as the unbroken peace of the Tokugawa régime became habitual,\r\nthe mood of the nation underwent a change. The samurai, no longer\r\nrequired to lead the frugal life of camp or barracks, began to live\r\nbeyond their incomes. \"They found difficulty in meeting the pecuniary\r\nengagements of everyday existence, so that money acquired new importance\r\nin their eyes, and they gradually forfeited the respect which their\r\ntraditional disinterestedness had won for them in the past.\" At the same\r\ntime the abuses of feudalism were thrown into increased salience. A\r\nlarge body of hereditary soldiers become an anomaly when fighting has\r\npassed even out of memory. On the other hand, the agricultural and\r\ncommercial classes acquired new importance. The enormous sums disbursed\r\nevery year in Yedo, for the maintenance of the great establishments\r\nwhich the feudal chiefs vied with each other in keeping there, enriched\r\nthe merchants and traders so greatly that their scale of living\r\nunderwent radical change. Buddhism was a potent influence, but its\r\nethical restraints were weakened by the conduct of its priests, who\r\nthemselves often yielded to the temptation of the time. The aristocracy\r\nadhered to its refined pastimes--performances of the _No_; tea reunions;\r\npoem composing; polo; football; equestrian archery; fencing and\r\ngambling--but the commoner, being excluded from all this realm and, at\r\nthe same time, emerging rapidly from his old position of penury and\r\ndegradation, began to develop luxurious proclivities and to demand\r\ncorresponding amusements. Thus the theatre came into existence; the\r\ndancing girl and the jester found lucrative employment; a popular school\r\nof art was founded and quickly carried to perfection; the _lupanar_\r\nassumed unprecedented dimensions; rich and costly costumes acquired wide\r\nvogue in despite of sumptuary laws enacted from time to time; wrestling\r\nbecame an important institution, and plutocracy asserted itself in the\r\nface of caste distinctions.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the change of social conditions thus taking place,\r\nhistory repeated itself at the shogun's court. The substance of\r\nadministrative power passed into the hands of a minister, its shadow\r\nalone remaining to the shogun. During only two generations were the\r\nsuccessors of Iyeyasu able to resist this traditional tendency. The\r\nrepresentative of the third--Iyetsuna (1661-1680)--succumbed to the\r\nmachinations of an ambitious minister, Sakai Takakiyo, and it may be\r\nsaid that from that time the nominal repository of administrative\r\nauthority in Yedo was generally a species of magnificent recluse,\r\nsecluded from contact with the outer world and seeing and hearing only\r\nthrough the eyes and ears of the ladies of his household. In this\r\nrespect the descendants of the great Tokugawa statesman found themselves\r\nreduced to a position precisely analogous to that of the emperor in\r\nKioto. Sovereign and shogun were alike mere abstractions so far as the\r\npractical work of government was concerned. With the great mass of the\r\nfeudal chiefs things fared similarly. These men who, in the days of\r\nNobunaga, Hideyoshi and Iyeyasu, had directed the policies of their\r\nfiefs and led their armies in the field, were gradually transformed,\r\nduring the long peace of the Tokugawa era, into voluptuous _fainéants_\r\nor, at best, thoughtless dilettanti, willing to abandon the direction of\r\ntheir affairs to seneschals and mayors, who, while on the whole their\r\nadministration was able and loyal, found their account in contriving and\r\nperpetuating the effacement of their chiefs. Thus, in effect, the\r\ngovernment of the country, taken out of the hands of the shogun and the\r\nfeudatories, fell into those of their vassals. There were exceptions, of\r\ncourse, but so rare as to be merely accidental.\r\n\r\nAnother important factor has to be noted. It has been shown above that\r\nIyeyasu bestowed upon his three sons the rich fiefs of Owari, Kii\r\n(Kishu) and Mito, and that these three families exclusively enjoyed the\r\nprivilege of furnishing an heir to the shogun should the latter be\r\nwithout direct issue. Mito ought therefore to have been a most unlikely\r\nplace for the conception and propagation of principles subversive of the\r\nshogun's administrative autocracy. Nevertheless, in the days of the\r\nsecond of the Mito chiefs at the close of the 17th century, there arose\r\nin that province a school of thinkers who, revolting against the\r\nascendancy of Chinese literature and of Buddhism, devoted themselves to\r\ncompiling a history such as should recall the attention of the nation to\r\nits own annals and revive its allegiance to Shinto. It would seem that\r\nin patronizing the compilation of this great work the Mito chief was\r\nswayed by the spirit of pure patriotism and studentship, and that he\r\ndiscerned nothing of the goal to which the new researches must lead the\r\nlitterati of his fief. \"He and they, for the sake of history and without\r\nany thought of politics, undertook a retrospect of their country's\r\nannals, and their frank analysis furnished conclusive proof that the\r\nemperor was the prime source of administrative authority and that its\r\nindependent exercise by a shogun must be regarded as a usurpation. They\r\ndid not attempt to give practical effect to their discoveries; the era\r\nwas essentially academical. But this galaxy of scholars projected into\r\nthe future a light which burned with growing force in each succeeding\r\ngeneration and ultimately burst into a flame which consumed feudalism\r\nand the shogunate,\" fused the nation into one, and restored the\r\ngoverning authority to the emperor. Of course the Mito men were not\r\nalone in this matter: many students subsequently trod in their footsteps\r\nand many others sought to stem the tendency; but the net result was\r\nfatal to faith in the dual system of government. Possibly had nothing\r\noccurred to furnish signal proof of the system's practical defects, it\r\nmight have long survived this theoretical disapproval. But the crisis\r\ncaused by the advent of foreign ships and by the forceful renewal of\r\nforeign intercourse in the 19th century afforded convincing evidence of\r\nthe shogunate's incapacity to protect the state's supposed interests and\r\nto enforce the traditional policy of isolation which the nation had\r\nlearned to consider essential to the empire's integrity.\r\n\r\nAnother important factor made for the fall of the shogunate. That factor\r\nwas the traditional disaffection of the two great southern fiefs,\r\nSatsuma and Choshu. When Iyeyasu parcelled out the empire, he deemed it\r\nthe wisest policy to leave these chieftains in full possession of their\r\nlarge estates. But this measure, construed as an evidence of weakness\r\nrather than a token of liberality, neither won the allegiance of the big\r\nfeudatories nor cooled their ambition. Thus no sooner did the nation\r\ndivide into two camps over the question of renewed foreign intercourse\r\nthan men of the above clans, in concert with representatives of certain\r\nof the old court nobles, placed themselves at the head of a movement\r\nanimated by two loudly proclaimed purposes: restoration of the\r\nadministration to the emperor, and expulsion of aliens. This latter\r\naspiration underwent a radical change when the bombardment of the\r\nSatsuma capital, Kagoshima, and the destruction of the Choshu forts and\r\nships at Shimonoseki proved conclusively to the Satsuma and Choshu clans\r\nthat Japan in her unequipped and backward condition could not hope to\r\nstand for a moment against the Occident in arms. But the unwelcome\r\ndiscovery was accompanied by a conviction that only a thoroughly united\r\nnation might aspire to preserve its independence, and thus the abolition\r\nof the dual form of government became more than ever an article of\r\npublic faith. It is unnecessary to recount the successive incidents\r\nwhich conspired to undermine the shogun's authority, and to destroy the\r\nprestige of the Yedo administration. Both had been reduced to vanishing\r\nquantities by the year 1866 when Keiki succeeded to the shogunate.\r\n\r\nKeiki, known historically as Yoshinobu, the last of the shoguns, was a\r\nman of matured intellect and high capacities. He had been put forward by\r\nthe anti-foreign Conservatives for the succession to the shogunate in\r\n1857 when the complications of foreign intercourse were in their first\r\nstage of acuteness. But, like many other intelligent Japanese, he had\r\nlearned, in the interval between 1857 and 1866, that to keep her doors\r\nclosed was an impossible task for Japan, and very quickly after taking\r\nthe reins of office he recognized that national union could never be\r\nachieved while power was divided between Kioto and Yedo. At this\r\njuncture there was addressed to him by Yodo, chief of the great Tosa\r\nfief, a memorial setting forth the hopelessness of the position in which\r\nthe Yedo court now found itself, and urging that, in the interests of\r\ngood government and in order that the nation's united strength might be\r\navailable to meet the exigencies of its new career, the administration\r\nshould be restored to the emperor. Keiki received this memorial in\r\nKioto. He immediately summoned a council of all the feudatories and high\r\nofficials then in the Imperial city, announced to them his intention to\r\nlay down his office, and, the next day, presented his resignation to the\r\nsovereign. This happened on the 14th of October 1867. It must be ranked\r\namong the signal events of the world's history, for it signified the\r\nvoluntary surrender of kingly authority wielded uninterruptedly for\r\nnearly three centuries. That the shogun's resignation was tendered in\r\ngood faith there can be no doubt, and had it been accepted in the same\r\nspirit, the great danger it involved might have been consummated without\r\nbloodshed or disorder. But the clansmen of Satsuma and Choshu were\r\ndistrustful. One of the shogun's first acts after assuming office had\r\nbeen to obtain from the throne an edict for imposing penalties on\r\nChoshu, and there was a precedent for suspecting that the renunciation\r\nof power by the shogun might merely prelude its resumption on a firmer\r\nbasis. Therefore steps were taken to induce the emperor, then a youth of\r\nfifteen, to issue a secret rescript to Satsuma and Choshu, denouncing\r\nthe shogun as the nation's enemy and enjoining his destruction. At the\r\nsame time all officials connected with the Tokugawa or suspected of\r\nsympathy with them were expelled from office in Kioto, and the shogun's\r\ntroops were deprived of the custody of the palace gates by methods which\r\nverged upon the use of armed force. In the face of such provocation\r\nKeiki's earnest efforts to restrain the indignation of his vassals and\r\nadherents failed. They marched against Kioto and were defeated,\r\nwhereupon Keiki left his castle at Osaka and retired to Yedo, where he\r\nsubsequently made unconditional surrender to the Imperial army. There is\r\nlittle more to be set down on this page of the history. The Yedo court\r\nconsented to lay aside its dignities and be stripped of its\r\nadministrative authority, but all the Tokugawa vassals and adherents did\r\nnot prove equally placable. There was resistance in the northern\r\nprovinces, where the Aizu feudatory refused to abandon the Tokugawa\r\ncause; there was an attempt to set up a rival candidate for the throne\r\nin the person of an Imperial prince who presided over the Uyeno\r\nMonastery in Yedo; and there was a wild essay on the part of the admiral\r\nof the shogun's fleet to establish a republic in the island of Yezo. But\r\nthese were mere ripples on the surface of the broad stream which set\r\ntowards the peaceful overthrow of the dual system of government and\r\nultimately towards the fall of feudalism itself. That this system, the\r\noutcome of five centuries of nearly continuous warfare, was swept away\r\nin almost as many weeks with little loss of life or destruction of\r\nproperty constitutes, perhaps, the most striking incident, certainly the\r\nmost momentous, in the history of the Japanese nation.\r\n\r\n_The Meiji Era._--It must be remembered that when reference is made to\r\nthe Japanese nation in connexion with these radical changes, only the\r\nnobles and the samurai are indicated--in other words, a section of the\r\npopulation representing about one-sixteenth of the whole. The bulk of\r\nthe people--the agricultural, the industrial and the mercantile\r\nclasses--remained outside the sphere of politics, not sharing the\r\nanti-foreign prejudice, or taking any serious interest in the great\r\nquestions of the time. Foreigners often noted with surprise the contrast\r\nbetween the fierce antipathy displayed towards them by certain samurai\r\non the one hand, and the genial, hospitable reception given to them by\r\nthe common people on the other. History teaches that the latter was the\r\nnatural disposition of the Japanese, the former a mood educated by\r\nspecial experiences. Further, even the comparatively narrow statement\r\nthat the restoration of the administrative power to the emperor was the\r\nwork of the nobles and the samurai must be taken with limitations. A\r\nmajority of the nobles entertained no idea of any necessity for change.\r\nThey were either held fast in the vice of Tokugawa authority, or\r\nparalyzed by the sensuous seductions of the lives provided for them by\r\nthe machinations of their retainers, who transferred the administrative\r\nauthority of the fiefs to their own hands, leaving its shadow only to\r\ntheir lords. It was among the retainers that longings for a new order of\r\nthings were generated. Some of these men were sincere disciples of\r\nprogress--a small band of students and deep thinkers who, looking\r\nthrough the narrow Dutch window at Deshima, had caught a glimmering\r\nperception of the realities that lay beyond the horizon of their\r\ncountry's prejudices. But the influence of such Liberals was\r\ncomparatively insignificant. Though they showed remarkable moral courage\r\nand tenacity of purpose, the age did not furnish any strong object\r\nlesson to enforce their propaganda of progress. The factors chiefly\r\nmaking for change were, first, the ambition of the southern clans to\r\noust the Tokugawa, and, secondly, the samurai's loyal instinct,\r\nreinforced by the teachings of his country's history, by the revival of\r\nthe Shinto cult, by the promptings of national enterprise, and by the\r\nobject-lessons of foreign intercourse.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Character of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nBut though essentially imperialistic in its prime purposes, the\r\nrevolution which involved the fall of the shogunate, and ultimately of\r\nfeudalism, may be called democratic with regard to the personnel of\r\nthose who planned and directed it. They were, for the most part, men\r\nwithout either official rank or social standing. That is a point\r\nessential to a clear understanding of the issue. Fifty-five individuals\r\nmay be said to have planned and carried out the overthrow of the Yedo\r\nadministration, and only five of them were territorial nobles. Eight,\r\nbelonging to the court nobility, laboured under the traditional\r\ndisadvantages of their class, poverty and political insignificance; and\r\nthe remaining forty-two, the hearts and hands of the movement, may be\r\ndescribed as ambitious youths, who sought to make a career for\r\nthemselves in the first place, and for their country in the second. The\r\naverage age of the whole did not exceed thirty. There was another\r\nelement for which any student of Japanese history might have been\r\nprepared: the Satsuma samurai aimed originally not merely at\r\noverthrowing the Tokugawa but also at obtaining the shogunate for their\r\nown chief. Possibly it would be unjust to say that all the leaders of\r\nthe great southern clan harboured that idea. But some of them certainly\r\ndid, and not until they had consented to abandon the project did their\r\nunion with Choshu, the other great southern clan, become possible--a\r\nunion without which the revolution could scarcely have been\r\naccomplished. This ambition of the Satsuma clansmen deserves special\r\nmention, because it bore remarkable fruit; it may be said to have laid\r\nthe foundation of constitutional government in Japan. For, in\r\nconsequence of the distrust engendered by such aspirations, the authors\r\nof the Restoration agreed that when the emperor assumed the reins of\r\npower, he should solemnly pledge himself to convene a deliberative\r\nassembly, to appoint to administrative posts men of intellect and\r\nerudition wherever they might be found, and to decide all measures in\r\naccordance with public opinion. This promise, referred to frequently in\r\nlater times as the Imperial oath at the Restoration, came to be\r\naccounted the basis of representative institutions, though in reality it\r\nwas intended solely as a guarantee against the political ascendancy of\r\nany one clan.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Anti-feudal Idea.\r\n\r\nAt the outset the necessity of abolishing feudalism did not present\r\nitself clearly to the leaders of the revolution. Their sole idea was the\r\nunification of the nation. But when they came to consider closely the\r\npractical side of the problem, they understood how far it would lead\r\nthem. Evidently that one homogeneous system of law should replace the\r\nmore or less heterogeneous systems operative in the various fiefs was\r\nessential, and such a substitution meant that the feudatories must be\r\ndeprived of their local autonomy and, incidentally, of their control of\r\nlocal finances. That was a stupendous change. Hitherto each feudal chief\r\nhad collected the revenues of his fief and had employed them at will,\r\nsubject to the sole condition of maintaining a body of troops\r\nproportionate to his income. He had been, and was still, an autocrat\r\nwithin the limits of his territory. On the other hand, the active\r\nauthors of the revolution were a small band of men mainly without\r\nprestige or territorial influence. It was impossible that they should\r\ndictate any measure sensibly impairing the local and fiscal autonomy of\r\nthe feudatories. No power capable of enforcing such a measure existed at\r\nthe time. All the great political changes in Japan had formerly been\r\npreceded by wars culminating in the accession of some strong clan to\r\nsupreme authority, whereas in this case there had been a displacement\r\nwithout a substitution--the Tokugawa had been overthrown and no new\r\nadministrators had been set up in their stead. It was, moreover, certain\r\nthat an attempt on the part of any one clan to constitute itself\r\nexecutor of the sovereign's mandates would have stirred the other clans\r\nto vehement resistance. In short, the leaders of the revolution found\r\nthemselves pledged to a new theory of government without any machinery\r\nfor carrying it into effect, or any means of abolishing the old\r\npractice. An ingenious exit from this curious dilemma was devised by the\r\nyoung reformers. They induced the feudal chiefs of Satsuma, Choshu, Tosa\r\nand Hizen, the four most powerful clans in the south, publicly to\r\nsurrender their fiefs to the emperor, praying his majesty to reorganize\r\nthem and to bring them all under the same system of law. In the case of\r\nShimazu, chief of Satsuma, and Yodo, chief of Tosa, this act must stand\r\nto their credit as a noble sacrifice. To them the exercise of power had\r\nbeen a reality and the effort of surrendering it must have been\r\ncorrespondingly costly. But the chiefs of Choshu and Hizen obeyed the\r\nsuggestions of their principal vassals with little, if any, sense of the\r\nprobable cost of obedience. The same remark applies to all the other\r\nfeudatories, with exceptions so rare as to emphasize the rule. They had\r\nlong been accustomed to abandon the management of their affairs to their\r\nleading clansmen, and they allowed themselves to follow the same\r\nguidance at this crisis. Out of more than 250 feudatories, only 17\r\nhesitated to imitate the example of the four southern fiefs.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Motives of the Reformers.\r\n\r\nAn explanation of this remarkable incident has been sought by supposing\r\nthat the samurai of the various clans, when they advised a course so\r\ninconsistent with fidelity to the interests of their feudal chiefs, were\r\ninfluenced by motives of personal ambition, imagining that they\r\nthemselves might find great opportunities under the new régime. Some\r\nhope of that kind may fairly be assumed, and was certainly realized, in\r\nthe case of the leading samurai of the four southern clans which headed\r\nthe movement. But it is plain that no such expectations can have been\r\ngenerally entertained. The simplest explanation seems to be the true\r\none: a certain course, indicated by the action of the four southern\r\nclans, was conceived to be in accord with the spirit of the Restoration,\r\nand not to adopt it would have been to shrink publicly from a sacrifice\r\ndictated by the principle of loyalty to the Throne--a principle which\r\nhad acquired supreme sanctity in the eyes of the men of that era. There\r\nmight have been some uncertainty about the initial step; but so soon as\r\nthat was taken by the southern clans their example acquired compelling\r\nforce. History shows that in political crises the Japanese samurai is\r\ngenerally ready to pay deference to certain canons of almost romantic\r\nmorality. There was a fever of loyalty and of patriotism in the air of\r\nthe year 1869. Any one hesitating, for obviously selfish reasons, to\r\nadopt a precedent such as that offered by the procedure of the great\r\nsouthern clans, would have seemed to forfeit the right of calling\r\nhimself a samurai. But although the leaders of this remarkable movement\r\nnow understood that they must contrive the total abolition of feudalism\r\nand build up a new administrative edifice on foundations of\r\nconstitutional monarchy, they appreciated the necessity of advancing\r\nslowly towards a goal which still lay beyond the range of their\r\nfollowers' vision. Thus the first steps taken after the surrender of the\r\nfiefs were to appoint the feudatories to the position of governors in\r\nthe districts over which they had previously ruled; to confirm the\r\nsamurai in the possession of their incomes and official positions; to\r\nput an end to the distinction between court nobles and territorial\r\nnobles, and to organize in Kioto a cabinet consisting of the leaders of\r\nthe restoration. Each new governor received one-tenth of the income of\r\nthe fief by way of emoluments; the pay of the officials and the samurai,\r\nas well as the administrative expenses of the district, was defrayed\r\nfrom the same source, and the residue, if any, was to pass into the\r\ntreasury of the central government.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Defects of the First Measures.\r\n\r\nThe defects of this system from a monarchical point of view soon became\r\nevident. It did not give the power of either the purse or the sword to\r\nthe sovereign. The revenues of the administrative districts continued to\r\nbe collected and disbursed by the former feudatories, who also retained\r\nthe control of the troops, the right of appointing and dismissing\r\nofficials, and almost complete local autonomy. A further radical step\r\nhad to be taken, and the leaders of reform, seeing nothing better than\r\nto continue the method of procedure which had thus far proved so\r\nsuccessful, contrived, first, that several of the administrative\r\ndistricts should send in petitions offering to surrender their local\r\nautonomy and be brought under the direct rule of the central government;\r\nsecondly, that a number of samurai should apply for permission to lay\r\naside their swords. While the nation was digesting the principles\r\nembodied in these petitions, the government made preparations for\r\nfurther measures of reform. The ex-chief of Satsuma, who showed some\r\numbrage because the services of his clan in promoting the restoration\r\nhad not been more fully recognized, was induced to take high ministerial\r\noffice, as were also the ex-chiefs of Choshu and Tosa. Each of the four\r\ngreat clans had now three representatives in the ministry. These clans\r\nwere further persuaded to send to Tokyo--whither the emperor had moved\r\nhis court--contingents of troops to form the nucleus of a national army.\r\nImportance attaches to these details because the principle of clan\r\nrepresentation, illustrated in the organization of the cabinet of 1871,\r\ncontinued to be approximately observed for many years in forming\r\nministries, and ultimately became a target for the attacks of party\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Adoption of Radical Measures.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of August 1871 an Imperial decree announced the abolition of\r\nthe system of local autonomy, and the removal of the territorial nobles\r\nfrom the posts of governor. The taxes of the former fiefs were to be\r\npaid thenceforth into the central treasury; all officials were to be\r\nappointed by the Imperial government, and the feudatories, retaining\r\npermanently an income of one-tenth of their original revenues, were to\r\nmake Tokyo their place of residence. As for the samurai, they remained\r\nfor the moment in possession of their hereditary pensions. Radical as\r\nthese changes seem, the disturbance caused by them was not great, since\r\nthey left the incomes of the military class untouched. Some of the\r\nincomes were for life only, but the majority were hereditary, and all\r\nhad been granted in consideration of their holders devoting themselves\r\nto military service. Four hundred thousand men approximately were in\r\nreceipt of such emoluments, and the total amount annually taken from the\r\ntax-payers for this purpose was about £2,000,000. Plainly the nation\r\nwould have to be relieved of this burden sooner or later. The samurai\r\nwere essentially an element of the feudal system, and that they should\r\nsurvive the latter's fall would have been incongruous. On the other\r\nhand, suddenly and wholly to deprive these men and their families--a\r\ntotal of some two million persons--of the means of subsistence on which\r\nthey had hitherto relied with absolute confidence, and in return for\r\nwhich they and their forefathers had rendered faithful service, would\r\nhave been an act of inhumanity. It may easily be conceived that this\r\nproblem caused extreme perplexity to the administrators of the new\r\nJapan. They left it unsolved for the moment, trusting that time and the\r\nloyalty of the samurai themselves would suggest some solution. As for\r\nthe feudal chiefs, who had now been deprived of all official status and\r\nreduced to the position of private gentlemen, without even a patent of\r\nnobility to distinguish them from ordinary individuals, they did not\r\nfind anything specially irksome or regrettable in their altered\r\nposition. No scrutiny had been made into the contents of their\r\ntreasuries. They were allowed to retain unquestioned possession of all\r\nthe accumulated funds of their former fiefs, and they also became public\r\ncreditors for annual allowances equal to one-tenth of their feudal\r\nrevenues. They had never previously been so pleasantly circumstanced. It\r\nis true that they were entirely stripped of all administrative and\r\nmilitary authority; but since their possession of such authority had\r\nbeen in most cases merely nominal, they only felt the change as a relief\r\nfrom responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Treatment of the Samurai.\r\n\r\nBy degrees public opinion began to declare itself with regard to the\r\nsamurai. If they were to be absorbed into the bulk of the people and to\r\nlose their fixed revenues, some capital must be placed at their disposal\r\nto begin the world again. The samurai themselves showed a noble faculty\r\nof resignation. They had been a privileged class, but they had purchased\r\ntheir privileges with their blood and by serving as patterns of all the\r\nqualities most prized among Japanese national characteristics. The\r\nrecord of their acts and the recognition of the people entitled them to\r\nlook for munificent treatment at the hands of the government which they\r\nhad been the means of setting up. Yet none of these considerations\r\nblinded them to the painful fact that the time had passed them by; that\r\nno place existed for them in the new polity. Many of them voluntarily\r\nstepped down into the company of the peasant or the tradesman, and many\r\nothers signified their willingness to join the ranks of common\r\nbread-winners if some aid was given to equip them for such a career.\r\nAfter two years' consideration the government took action. A decree\r\nannounced, in 1873, that the treasury was prepared to commute the\r\npensions of the samurai at the rate of six years' purchase for\r\nhereditary pensions and four years for life pensions--one-half of the\r\ncommutation to be paid in cash, and one-half in bonds bearing interest\r\nat the rate of 8%. It will be seen that a perpetual pension of £10 would\r\nbe exchanged for a payment of £30 in cash, together with securities\r\ngiving an income of £2, 8s.; and that a £10 life pensioner received £20\r\nin cash and securities yielding £1, 12s. annually. It is scarcely\r\ncredible that the samurai should have accepted such an arrangement.\r\nSomething, perhaps, must be ascribed to their want of business\r\nknowledge, but the general explanation is that they made a large\r\nsacrifice in the interests of their country. Nothing in all their career\r\nas soldiers became them better than their manner of abandoning it. They\r\nwere told that they might lay aside their swords, and many of them did\r\nso, though from time immemorial they had cherished the sword as the mark\r\nof a gentleman, the most precious possession of a warrior, and the one\r\noutward evidence that distinguished men of their order from common\r\ntoilers after gain. They saw themselves deprived of their military\r\nemployment, were invited to surrender more than one-half of the income\r\nit brought, and knew that they were unprepared alike by education and by\r\ntradition to earn bread in any calling save that of arms. Yet, at the\r\ninvitation of a government which they had helped to establish, many of\r\nthem bowed their heads quietly to this sharp reverse of fortune. It was\r\ncertainly a striking instance of the fortitude and resignation which the\r\ncreed of the samurai required him to display in the presence of\r\nadversity. As yet, however, the government's measures with regard to the\r\nsamurai were not compulsory. Men laid aside their swords and commuted\r\ntheir pensions at their own option.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Saigo Takamori.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile differences of opinion began to occur among the leaders of\r\nprogress themselves. Coalitions formed for destructive purposes are\r\noften found unable to endure the strain of constructive efforts. Such\r\nlack of cohesion might easily have been foreseen in the case of the\r\nJapanese reformers. Young men without experience of public affairs, or\r\nspecial education to fit them for responsible posts, found the duty\r\nsuddenly imposed on them not only of devising administrative and fiscal\r\nsystems universally applicable to a nation hitherto divided into a\r\ncongeries of semi-independent principalities, but also of shaping the\r\ncountry's demeanour towards novel problems of foreign intercourse and\r\nalien civilization. So long as the heat of their assault upon the\r\nshogunate fused them into a homogeneous party they worked together\r\nsuccessfully. But when they had to build a brand-new edifice on the\r\nruins of a still vivid past, it was inevitable that their opinions\r\nshould vary as to the nature of the materials to be employed. In this\r\ndivergence of views many of the capital incidents of Japan's modern\r\nhistory had their origin. Of the fifty-five men whose united efforts had\r\ncompassed the fall of the shogunate, five stood conspicuous above their\r\ncolleagues. They were Iwakura and Sanjo, court nobles; Saigo and Okubo,\r\nsamurai of Satsuma, and Kido, a samurai of Choshu. In the second rank\r\ncame many men of great gifts, whose youth alone disqualified them for\r\nprominence--Ito, the constructive statesman of the Meiji era, who\r\ninspired nearly all the important measures of the time, though he did\r\nnot openly figure as their originator; Inouye, who never lacked a\r\nresource or swerved from the dictates of loyalty; Okuma, a politician of\r\nsubtle, versatile and vigorous intellect; Itagaki, the Rousseau of his\r\nera; and a score of others created by the extraordinary circumstances\r\nwith which they had to deal. But the five first mentioned were the\r\ncaptains, the rest only lieutenants. Among the five, four were sincere\r\nreformers--not free, of course, from selfish motives, but truthfully\r\nbent upon promoting the interests of their country before all other\r\naims. The fifth, Saigo Takamori, was a man in whom boundless ambition\r\nlay concealed under qualities of the noblest and most enduring type. His\r\nabsolute freedom from every trace of sordidness gave currency to a\r\nbelief that his aims were of the simplest; the story of his career\r\nsatisfied the highest canons of the samurai; his massive physique,\r\ncommanding presence and sunny aspect impressed and attracted even those\r\nwho had no opportunity of admiring his life of self-sacrificing effort\r\nor appreciating the remarkable military talent he possessed. In the\r\nfirst part of his career, the elevation of his clan to supreme power\r\nseems to have been his sole motive, but subsequently personal ambition\r\nappears to have swayed him. To the consummation of either object the\r\npreservation of the military class was essential. By the swords of the\r\nsamurai alone could a new _imperium in imperio_ be carved out. On the\r\nother hand, Saigo's colleagues in the ministry saw clearly not only that\r\nthe samurai were an unwarrantable burden on the nation, but also that\r\ntheir continued existence after the fall of feudalism would be a menace\r\nto public peace as well as an anomaly. Therefore they took the steps\r\nalready described, and followed them by a conscription law, making every\r\nadult male liable for military service without regard to his social\r\nstanding. It is easy to conceive how painfully unwelcome this\r\nconscription law proved to the samurai. Many of them were not unwilling\r\nto commute their pensions, since their creed had always forbidden them\r\nto care for money. Many of them were not unwilling to abandon the habit\r\nof carrying swords, since the adoption of foreign costume rendered such\r\na custom incongruous and inconvenient. But very few of them could\r\nreadily consent to step down from their cherished position as the\r\nmilitary class, and relinquish their traditional title to bear the whole\r\nresponsibility and enjoy the whole honour of fighting their country's\r\nbattles. They had supposed, not unreasonably, that service in the army\r\nand navy would be reserved exclusively for them and their sons, whereas\r\nnow the commonest rustic, mechanic or tradesman would be equally\r\neligible.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Split among the Reformers.\r\n\r\nWhile the pain of this blow was still fresh there occurred a trouble\r\nwith Korea. The little state had behaved with insulting contumely, and\r\nwhen Japan's course came to be debated in Tokyo, a disruption resulted\r\nin the ranks of the reformers. Saigo saw in a foreign war the sole\r\nremaining chance of achieving his ambition by lawful means. The\r\ngovernment's conscription scheme, yet in its infancy, had not produced\r\neven the skeleton of an army. If Korea had to be conquered, the samurai\r\nmust be employed; and their employment would mean, if not their\r\nrehabilitation, at least their organization into a force which, under\r\nSaigo's leadership, might dictate a new policy. Other members of the\r\ncabinet believed that the nation would be disgraced if it tamely endured\r\nKorea's insults. Thus several influential voices swelled the clamour for\r\nwar. But a peace party offered strenuous opposition. Its members saw the\r\ncollateral issues of the problem, and declared that the country must not\r\nthink of taking up arms during a period of radical transition. The final\r\ndiscussion took place in the emperor's presence. The advocates of peace\r\nunderstood the national significance of the issue and perceived that\r\nthey were debating, not merely whether there should be peace or war, but\r\nwhether the country should halt or advance on its newly adopted path of\r\nprogress. They prevailed, and four members of the cabinet, including\r\nSaigo, resigned. This rupture was destined to have far-reaching\r\nconsequences. One of the seceders immediately raised the standard of\r\nrevolt. Among the devices employed by him to win adherents was an\r\nattempt to fan into flame the dying embers of the anti-foreign\r\nsentiment. The government easily crushed the insurrection. Another\r\nseceder was Itagaki Taisuke. The third and most prominent was Saigo, who\r\nseems to have concluded from that moment that he must abandon his aims\r\nor achieve them by force. He retired to his native province of Satsuma,\r\nand applied his whole resources, his great reputation and the devoted\r\nloyalty of a number of able followers to organizing and equipping a\r\nstrong body of samurai. Matters were facilitated for him by the\r\nconservatism of the celebrated Shimazu Saburo, former chief of Satsuma,\r\nwho, though not opposed to foreign intercourse, had been revolted by the\r\nwholesale iconoclasm of the time, and by the indiscriminate rejection of\r\nJapanese customs in favour of foreign. He protested vehemently against\r\nwhat seemed to him a slavish abandonment of the nation's individuality,\r\nand finding his protest fruitless, he set himself to preserve in his own\r\ndistant province, where the writ of the Yedo government had never run,\r\nthe fashions, institutions and customs which his former colleagues in\r\nthe administration were ruthlessly rejecting. Satsuma thus became a\r\ncentre of conservative influences, among which Saigo and his constantly\r\naugmenting band of samurai found a congenial environment. During four\r\nyears this breach between the central government and the southern clan\r\ngrew constantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Final Abolition of Sword-wearing and Pensions.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile (1876) two extreme measures were adopted by the\r\ngovernment: a veto on the wearing of swords, and an edict ordering the\r\ncompulsory commutation of the pensions and allowances received by the\r\nnobles and the samurai. Three years previously the discarding of swords\r\nhad been declared optional, and a scheme of voluntary commutation had\r\nbeen announced. Many had bowed quietly to the spirit of these\r\nenactments. But many still retained their swords and drew their pensions\r\nas of old, obstructing, in the former respect, the government's projects\r\nfor the reorganization of society, and imposing, in the latter, an\r\nintolerable burden on the resources of the treasury. The government\r\nthought that the time had come, and that its own strength sufficed, to\r\nsubstitute compulsion for persuasion. The financial measure--which was\r\ncontrived so as to affect the smallest pension-holders least\r\ninjuriously--evoked no complaint. The samurai remained faithful to the\r\ncreed which forbade them to be concerned about money. But the veto\r\nagainst sword-wearing overtaxed the patience of the extreme\r\nConservatives. It seemed to them that all the most honoured traditions\r\nof their country were being ruthlessly sacrificed on the altar of alien\r\ninnovations. Armed protests ensued. A few score of samurai, equipping\r\nthemselves with the hauberks and weapons of old times, fell upon the\r\ngarrison of a castle, killed or wounded some 300, and then, retiring to\r\nan adjacent mountain, died by their own hands. Their example found\r\nimitators in two other places, and finally the Satsuma samurai rose in\r\narms under Saigo.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Satsuma Insurrection.\r\n\r\nThis was an insurrection very different in dimensions and motives from\r\nthe outbreaks that had preceded it. During four years the preparations\r\nof the Satsuma men had been unremitting. They were equipped with rifles\r\nand cannon; they numbered some 30,000; they were all of the military\r\nclass, and in addition to high training in western tactics and in the\r\nuse of modern arms of precision, they knew how to wield that formidable\r\nweapon, the Japanese sword, of which their opponents were for the most\r\npart ignorant. Ostensibly their object was to restore the samurai to\r\ntheir old supremacy, and to secure for them all the posts in the army,\r\nthe navy and the administration. But although they doubtless entertained\r\nthat intention, it was put forward mainly with the hope of winning the\r\nco-operation of the military class throughout the empire. The real\r\npurpose of the revolt was to secure the governing power for Satsuma. A\r\nbitter struggle ensued. Beginning on the 29th of January 1877, it was\r\nbrought to a close on the 24th of September by the death, voluntary or\r\nin battle, of all the rebel leaders. During that period the number of\r\nmen engaged on the government's side had been 66,000 and the number on\r\nthe side of the rebels 40,000, out of which total the killed and wounded\r\naggregated 35,000, or 33% of the whole. Had the government's troops been\r\nfinally defeated, there can be no doubt that the samurai's exclusive\r\ntitle to man and direct the army and navy would have been\r\nre-established, and Japan would have found herself permanently saddled\r\nwith a military class, heavily burdening her finances, seriously\r\nimpeding her progress towards constitutional government, and\r\nperpetuating all the abuses incidental to a policy in which the power of\r\nthe sword rests entirely in the hands of one section of the people. The\r\nnation scarcely appreciated the great issues that were at stake. It\r\nfound more interest in the struggle as furnishing a conclusive test of\r\nthe efficiency of the new military system compared with the old. The\r\narmy sent to quell the insurrection consisted of recruits drawn\r\nindiscriminately from every class of the people. Viewed in the light of\r\nhistory, it was an army of commoners, deficient in the fighting\r\ninstinct, and traditionally demoralized for all purposes of resistance\r\nto the military class. The Satsuma insurgents, on the contrary,\r\nrepresented the flower of the samurai, long trained for this very\r\nstruggle, and led by men whom the nation regarded as its bravest\r\ncaptains. The result dispelled all doubts about the fighting quality of\r\nthe people at large.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Steps of Progress.\r\n\r\nConcurrently with these events the government diligently endeavoured to\r\nequip the country with all the paraphernalia of Occidental civilization.\r\nIt is easy to understand that the master-minds of the era, who had\r\nplanned and carried out the Restoration, continued to take the lead in\r\nall paths of progress. Their intellectual superiority entitled them to\r\nact as guides; they had enjoyed exceptional opportunities of acquiring\r\nenlightenment by visits to Europe and America, and the Japanese people\r\nhad not yet lost the habit of looking to officialdom for every\r\ninitiative. But the spectacle thus presented to foreign onlookers was\r\nnot altogether without disquieting suggestions. The government's reforms\r\nseemed to outstrip the nation's readiness for them, and the results wore\r\nan air of some artificiality and confusion. Englishmen were employed to\r\nsuperintend the building of railways, the erection of telegraphs, the\r\nconstruction of lighthouses and the organization of a navy. To Frenchmen\r\nwas entrusted the work of recasting the laws and training the army in\r\nstrategy and tactics. Educational affairs, the organization of a postal\r\nservice, the improvement of agriculture and the work of colonization\r\nwere supervised by Americans. The teaching of medical science, the\r\ncompilation of a commercial code, the elaboration of a system of local\r\ngovernment, and ultimately the training of military officers were\r\nassigned to Germans. For instruction in sculpture and painting Italians\r\nwere engaged. Was it possible that so many novelties should be\r\nsuccessfully assimilated, or that the nation should adapt itself to\r\nsystems planned by a motley band of aliens who knew nothing of its\r\ncharacter and customs? These questions did not trouble the Japanese\r\nnearly so much as they troubled strangers. The truth is that\r\nconservatism was not really required to make the great sacrifices\r\nsuggested by appearances. Among all the innovations of the era the only\r\none that a Japanese could not lay aside at will was the new fashion of\r\ndressing the hair. He abandoned the _queue_ irrevocably. But for the\r\nrest he lived a dual life. During hours of duty he wore a fine uniform,\r\nshaped and decorated in foreign style. But so soon as he stepped out of\r\noffice or off parade, he reverted to his own comfortable and picturesque\r\ncostume. Handsome houses were built and furnished according to Western\r\nmodels. But each had an annex where alcoves, verandas, matted floors and\r\npaper sliding doors continued to do traditional duty. Beefsteaks, beer,\r\n\"grape-wine,\" knives and forks came into use on occasion. But rice-bowls\r\nand chopsticks held their everyday place as of old. In a word, though\r\nthe Japanese adopted every convenient and serviceable attribute of\r\nforeign civilization, such as railways, steamships, telegraphs,\r\npost-offices, banks and machinery of all kinds; though they accepted\r\nOccidental sciences, and, to a large extent, Occidental philosophies;\r\nthough they recognized the superiority of European jurisprudence and set\r\nthemselves to bring their laws into accord with it, they nevertheless\r\npreserved the essentials of their own mode of life and never lost their\r\nindividuality. A remarkable spirit of liberalism and a fine eclectic\r\ninstinct were needed for the part they acted, but they did no radical\r\nviolence to their own traditions, creeds and conventions. There was\r\nindeed a certain element of incongruity and even grotesqueness in the\r\nnation's doings. Old people cannot fit their feet to new roads without\r\nsome clumsiness. The Japanese had grown very old in their special paths,\r\nand their novel departure was occasionally disfigured by solecisms. The\r\nrefined taste that guided them unerringly in all the affairs of life as\r\nthey had been accustomed to live it, seemed to fail them signally when\r\nthey emerged into an alien atmosphere. They have given their proofs,\r\nhowever. It is now seen that the apparently excessive rapidity of their\r\nprogress did not overtax their capacities; that they have emerged safely\r\nfrom their destructive era and carried their constructive career within\r\nreach of certain success, and that while they have still to develop some\r\nof the traits of their new civilization, there is no prospect whatever\r\nof its proving ultimately unsuited to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Development of Representative Government.\r\n\r\nAfter the Satsuma rebellion, nothing disturbed the even tenor of Japan's\r\ndomestic politics except an attempt on the part of some of her people to\r\nforce the growth of parliamentary government. It is evident that the\r\nunited effort made by the fiefs to overthrow the system of dual\r\ngovernment and wrest the administrative power from the shogun could have\r\nonly one logical outcome: the combined exercise of the recovered power\r\nby those who had been instrumental in recovering it. That was the\r\nmeaning of the oath taken by the emperor at the Restoration, when the\r\nyouthful sovereign was made to say that wise counsels should be widely\r\nsought, and all things determined by public discussion. But the framers\r\nof the oath had the samurai alone in view. Into their consideration the\r\ncommon people--farmers, mechanics, tradesmen--did not enter at all, nor\r\nhad the common people themselves any idea of advancing a claim to be\r\nconsidered. A voice in the administration would have been to them an\r\nembarrassing rather than a pleasing privilege. Thus the first\r\ndeliberative assembly was composed of nobles and samurai only. A mere\r\ndebating club without any legislative authority, it was permanently\r\ndissolved after two sessions. Possibly the problem of a parliament might\r\nhave been long postponed after that fiasco, had it not found an ardent\r\nadvocate in Itagaki Taisuke (afterwards Count Itagaki). A Tosa samurai\r\nconspicuous as a leader of the restoration movement, Itagaki was among\r\nthe advocates of recourse to strong measures against Korea in 1873, and\r\nhis failure to carry his point, supplemented by a belief that a large\r\nsection of public opinion would have supported him had there been any\r\nmachinery for appealing to it, gave fresh impetus to his faith in\r\nconstitutional government. Resigning office on account of the Korean\r\nquestion, he became the nucleus of agitation in favour of a\r\nparliamentary system, and under his banner were enrolled not only\r\ndiscontented samurai but also many of the young men who, returning from\r\ndirect observation of the working of constitutional systems in Europe or\r\nAmerica, and failing to obtain official posts in Japan, attributed their\r\nfailure to the oligarchical form of their country's polity. Thus in the\r\ninterval between 1873 and 1877 there were two centres of disturbance in\r\nJapan: one in Satsuma, where Saigo figured as leader; the other in Tosa,\r\nunder Itagaki's guidance. When the Satsuma men appealed to arms in 1877,\r\na widespread apprehension prevailed lest the Tosa politicians should\r\nthrow in their lot with the insurgents. Such a fear had its origin in\r\nfailure to understand the object of the one side or to appreciate the\r\nsincerity of the other. Saigo and his adherents fought to substitute a\r\nSatsuma clique for the oligarchy already in power. Itagaki and his\r\nfollowers struggled for constitutional institutions. The two could not\r\nhave anything in common. There was consequently no coalition. But the\r\nTosa agitators did not neglect to make capital out of the embarrassment\r\ncaused by the Satsuma rebellion. While the struggle was at its height,\r\nthey addressed to the government a memorial, charging the administration\r\nwith oppressive measures to restrain the voice of public opinion, with\r\nusurpation of power to the exclusion of the nation at large, and with\r\nlevelling downwards instead of upwards, since the samurai had been\r\nreduced to the rank of commoners, whereas the commoners should have been\r\neducated up to the standard of the samurai. This memorial asked for a\r\nrepresentative assembly and talked of popular rights. But since the\r\ndocument admitted that the people were uneducated, it is plain that\r\nthere cannot have been any serious idea of giving them a share in the\r\nadministration. In fact, the Tosa Liberals were not really contending\r\nfor popular representation in the full sense of the term. What they\r\nwanted was the creation of some machinery for securing to the samurai at\r\nlarge a voice in the management of state affairs. They chafed against\r\nthe fact that, whereas the efforts and sacrifices demanded by the\r\nRestoration had fallen equally on the whole military class, the\r\nofficial prizes under the new system were monopolized by a small coterie\r\nof men belonging to the four principal clans. It is on record that\r\nItagaki would have been content originally with an assembly consisting\r\nhalf of officials, half of non-official samurai, and not including any\r\npopular element whatever.\r\n\r\nBut the government did not believe that the time had come even for a\r\nmeasure such as the Tosa Liberals advocated. The statesmen in power\r\nconceived that the nation must be educated up to constitutional\r\nstandards, and that the first step should be to provide an official\r\nmodel. Accordingly, in 1874, arrangements were made for periodically\r\nconvening an assembly of prefectural governors, in order that they might\r\nact as channels of communication between the central authorities and the\r\nprovincial population, and mutually exchange ideas as to the safest and\r\nmost effective methods of encouraging progress within the limits of\r\ntheir jurisdictions. This was intended to be the embryo of\r\nrepresentative institutions. But the governors, being officials\r\nappointed by the cabinet, did not bear in any sense the character of\r\npopular nominees, nor could it even be said that they reflected the\r\npublic feeling of the districts they administered, for their habitual\r\nand natural tendency was to try, by means of heroic object lessons, to\r\nwin the people's allegiance to the government's progressive policy,\r\nrather than to convince the government of the danger of overstepping the\r\npeople's capacities.\r\n\r\nThese conventions of local officials had no legislative power whatever.\r\nThe foundations of a body for discharging that function were laid in\r\n1875, when a senate (_genro-in_) was organized. It consisted of official\r\nnominees, and its duty was to discuss and revise all laws and ordinances\r\nprior to their promulgation. It is to be noted, however, that expediency\r\nnot less than a spirit of progress presided at the creation of the\r\nsenate. Into its ranks were drafted a number of men for whom no places\r\ncould be found in the executive, and who, without some official\r\nemployment, would have been drawn into the current of disaffection. From\r\nthat point of view the senate soon came to be regarded as a kind of\r\nhospital for administrative invalids, but undoubtedly its discharge of\r\nquasi-legislative functions proved suggestive, useful and instructive.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Assassination of Okubo.\r\n\r\nThe second meeting of the provincial governors had just been prorogued\r\nwhen, in the spring of 1878, the great minister, Okubo Toshimitsu, was\r\nassassinated. Okubo, uniformly ready to bear the heaviest burden of\r\nresponsibility in every political complication, had stood prominently\r\nbefore the nation as Saigo's opponent. He fell under the swords of\r\nSaigo's sympathizers. They immediately surrendered themselves to\r\njustice, having taken previous care to circulate a statement of motives,\r\nwhich showed that they ranked the government's failure to establish\r\nrepresentative institutions as a sin scarcely less heinous than its\r\nalleged abuses of power. Well-informed followers of Saigo could never\r\nhave been sincere believers in representative institutions. These men\r\nbelonged to a province far removed from the scene of Saigo's desperate\r\nstruggle. But the broad fact that they had sealed with their life-blood\r\nan appeal for a political change indicated the existence of a strong\r\npublic conviction which would derive further strength from their act.\r\nThe Japanese are essentially a brave people. Throughout the troublous\r\nevents that preceded and followed the Restoration, it is not possible to\r\npoint to one man whose obedience to duty or conviction was visibly\r\nweakened by prospects of personal peril. Okubo's assassination did not\r\nalarm any of his colleagues; but they understood its suggestiveness, and\r\nhastened to give effect to a previously formed resolve.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Local Government.\r\n\r\nTwo months after Okubo's death, an edict announced that elective\r\nassemblies should forthwith be established in various prefectures and\r\ncities. These assemblies were to consist of members having a high\r\nproperty qualification, elected by voters having one-half of that\r\nqualification; the voting to be by signed ballot, and the session to\r\nlast for one month in the spring of each year. As to their functions,\r\nthey were to determine the method of levying and spending local taxes,\r\nsubject to approval by the minister of state for home affairs; to\r\nscrutinize the accounts for the previous year, and, if necessary, to\r\npresent petitions to the central government. Thus the foundations of\r\ngenuine representative institutions were laid. It is true that\r\nlegislative power was not vested in the local assemblies, but in all\r\nother important respects they discharged parliamentary duties. Their\r\nhistory need not be related at any length. Sometimes they came into\r\nviolent collision with the governor of the prefecture, and unsightly\r\nstruggles resulted. The governors were disposed to advocate public works\r\nwhich the people considered extravagant; and further, as years went by,\r\nand as political organizations grew stronger, there was found in each\r\nassembly a group of men ready to oppose the governor simply because of\r\nhis official status. But on the whole the system worked well. The local\r\nassemblies served as training schools for the future parliament, and\r\ntheir members showed devotion to public duty as well as considerable\r\naptitude for debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Liberal Party.\r\n\r\nThis was not what Itagaki and his followers wanted. Their purpose was to\r\noverthrow the clique of clansmen who, holding the reins of\r\nadministrative power, monopolized the prizes of officialdom. Towards the\r\nconsummation of such an aim the local assemblies helped little. Itagaki\r\nredoubled his agitation. He organized his fellow-thinkers into an\r\nassociation called _jiyuto_ (Liberals), the first political party in\r\nJapan, to whose ranks there very soon gravitated several men who had\r\nbeen in office and resented the loss of it; many that had never been in\r\noffice and desired to be; and a still greater number who sincerely\r\nbelieved in the principles of political liberty, but had not yet\r\nconsidered the possibility of immediately adapting such principles to\r\nJapan's case. It was in the nature of things that an association of this\r\nkind, professing such doctrines, should present a picturesque aspect to\r\nthe public, and that its collisions with the authorities should invite\r\npopular sympathy. Nor were collisions infrequent. For the government,\r\narguing that if the nation was not ready for representative\r\ninstitutions, neither was it ready for full freedom of speech or of\r\npublic meeting, legislated consistently with that theory, and entrusted\r\nto the police large powers of control over the press and the platform.\r\nThe exercise of these powers often created situations in which the\r\nLiberals were able to pose as victims of official tyranny, so that they\r\ngrew in popularity and the contagion of political agitation spread.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Progressist Party.\r\n\r\nThree years later (1881) another split occurred in the ranks of the\r\nruling oligarchy. Okuma Shigenobu (afterwards Count Okuma) seceded from\r\nthe administration, and was followed by a number of able men who had\r\nowed their appointments to his patronage, or who, during his tenure of\r\noffice as minister of finance, had passed under the influence of his\r\npowerful personality. If Itagaki be called the Rousseau of Japan, Okuma\r\nmay be regarded as the Peel. To remarkable financial ability and a\r\nlucid, vigorous judgment he added the faculty of placing himself on the\r\ncrest of any wave which a genuine _aura popularis_ had begun to swell.\r\nHe, too, inscribed on his banner of revolt against the oligarchy the\r\nmotto \"constitutional government,\" and it might have been expected that\r\nhis followers would join hands with those of Itagaki, since the avowed\r\npolitical purpose of both was identical. They did nothing of the kind.\r\nOkuma organized an independent party, calling themselves Progressists\r\n(_shimpoto_), who not only stood aloof from the Liberals but even\r\nassumed an attitude hostile to them. This fact is eloquent. It shows\r\nthat Japan's first political parties were grouped, not about principles,\r\nbut about persons. Hence an inevitable lack of cohesion among their\r\nelements and a constant tendency to break up into caves and coteries.\r\nThese are the characteristics that render the story of political\r\nevolution in Japan so perplexing to a foreign student. He looks for\r\ndifferences of platform and finds none. Just as a true Liberal must be a\r\nProgressist, and a true Progressist a Liberal, so, though each may cast\r\nhis profession of faith in a mould of different phrases, the ultimate\r\nshape must be the same. The mainsprings of early political agitation in\r\nJapan were personal grievances and a desire to wrest the administrative\r\npower from the hands of the statesmen who had held it so long as to\r\novertax the patience of their rivals. He that searches for profound\r\nmoral or ethical bases will be disappointed. There were no\r\nConservatives. Society was permeated with the spirit of progress. In a\r\ncomparative sense the epithet \"Conservative\" might have been applied to\r\nthe statesmen who proposed to defer parliamentary institutions until the\r\npeople, as distinguished from the former samurai, had been in some\r\nmeasure prepared for such an innovation. But since these very statesmen\r\nwere the guiding spirits of the whole Meiji revolution, it was plain\r\nthat their convictions must be radical, and that, unless they did\r\nviolence to their record, they must finally lead the country to\r\nrepresentative institutions, the logical sequel of their own reforms.\r\n\r\nOkubo's assassination had been followed, in 1878, by an edict announcing\r\nthe establishment of local assemblies. Okuma's secession in 1881 was\r\nfollowed by an edict announcing that a national assembly would be\r\nconvened in 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Anti-Government Agitation.\r\n\r\nThe political parties, having now virtually attained their object, might\r\nhave been expected to desist from further agitation. But they had\r\nanother task to perform--that of disseminating anti-official prejudices\r\namong the future electors. They worked diligently, and they had an\r\nundisputed field, for no one was put forward to champion the\r\ngovernment's cause. The campaign was not always conducted on lawful\r\nlines. There were plots to assassinate ministers; there was an attempt\r\nto employ dynamite, and there was a scheme to foment an insurrection in\r\nKorea. On the other hand, dispersals of political meetings by order of\r\npolice inspectors, and suspension or suppression of newspapers by the\r\nunchallengeable verdict of a minister for home affairs, were common\r\noccurrences. The breach widened steadily. It is true that Okuma rejoined\r\nthe cabinet for a time in 1887, but he retired again in circumstances\r\nthat aggravated his party's hostility to officialdom. In short, during\r\nthe ten years immediately prior to the opening of the first parliament,\r\nan anti-government propaganda was incessantly preached from the platform\r\nand in the press.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the statesmen in power resolutely pursued their path of\r\nprogressive reform. They codified the civil and penal laws, remodelling\r\nthem on Western bases; they brought a vast number of affairs within the\r\nscope of minute regulations; they rescued the finances from confusion\r\nand restored them to a sound condition; they recast the whole framework\r\nof local government; they organized a great national bank, and\r\nestablished a network of subordinate institutions throughout the\r\ncountry; they pushed on the work of railway construction, and\r\nsuccessfully enlisted private enterprise in its cause; they steadily\r\nextended the postal and telegraphic services; they economized public\r\nexpenditures so that the state's income always exceeded its outlays;\r\nthey laid the foundations of a strong mercantile marine; they instituted\r\na system of postal savings-banks; they undertook large schemes of\r\nharbour improvement and road-making; they planned and put into operation\r\nan extensive programme of riparian improvement; they made civil service\r\nappointments depend on competitive examination; they sent numbers of\r\nstudents to Europe and America to complete their studies; and by\r\ntactful, persevering diplomacy they gradually introduced a new tone into\r\nthe empire's relations with foreign powers. Japan's affairs were never\r\nbetter administered.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Constitution of 1890.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 the Constitution was promulgated. Imposing ceremonies marked the\r\nevent. All the nation's notables were summoned to the palace to witness\r\nthe delivery of the important document by the sovereign to the prime\r\nminister; salvos of artillery were fired; the cities were illuminated,\r\nand the people kept holiday. Marquis (afterwards Prince) Ito directed\r\nthe framing of the Constitution. He had visited the Occident for the\r\npurpose of investigating the development of parliamentary institutions\r\nand studying their practical working. His name is connected with nearly\r\nevery great work of constructive statesmanship in the history of new\r\nJapan, and perhaps the crown of his legislative career was the drafting\r\nof the Constitution, to which the Japanese people point proudly as the\r\nonly charter of the kind voluntarily given by a sovereign to his\r\nsubjects. In other countries such concessions were always the outcome of\r\nlong struggles between ruler and ruled. In Japan the emperor freely\r\ndivested himself of a portion of his prerogatives and transferred them\r\nto the people. That view of the case, as may be seen from the story told\r\nabove, is not untinged with romance; but in a general sense it is true.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Working of the System.\r\n\r\nNo incident in Japan's modern career seemed more hazardous than this\r\nsudden plunge into parliamentary institutions. There had been some\r\npreparation. Provincial assemblies had partially familiarized the people\r\nwith the methods of deliberative bodies. But provincial assemblies were\r\nat best petty arenas--places where the making or mending of roads, and\r\nthe policing and sanitation of villages came up for discussion, and\r\nwhere political parties exercised no legislative function nor found any\r\nopportunity to attack the government or to debate problems of national\r\ninterest. Thus the convening of a diet and the sudden transfer of\r\nfinancial and legislative authority from the throne and its entourage of\r\ntried statesmen to the hands of men whose qualifications for public life\r\nrested on the verdict of electors, themselves apparently devoid of all\r\nlight to guide their choice--this sweeping innovation seemed likely to\r\ntax severely, if not to overtax completely, the progressive capacities\r\nof the nation. What enhanced the interest of the situation was that the\r\noligarchs who held the administrative power had taken no pains to win a\r\nfollowing in the political field. Knowing that the opening of the diet\r\nwould be a veritable letting loose of the dogs of war, an unmuzzling of\r\nthe agitators whose mouths had hitherto been partly closed by legal\r\nrestrictions upon free speech, but who would now enjoy complete immunity\r\nwithin the walls of the assembly whatever the nature of their\r\nutterances--foreseeing all this, the statesmen of the day nevertheless\r\nstood severely aloof from alliances of every kind, and discharged their\r\nadministrative functions with apparent indifference to the changes that\r\npopular representation could not fail to induce. This somewhat\r\ninexplicable display of unconcern became partially intelligible when the\r\nconstitution was promulgated, for it then appeared that the cabinet's\r\ntenure of office was to depend solely on the emperor's will; that\r\nministers were to take their mandate from the Throne, not from\r\nparliament. This fact was merely an outcome of the theory underlying\r\nevery part of the Japanese polity. Laws might be redrafted, institutions\r\nremodelled, systems recast, but amid all changes and mutations one\r\nsteady point must be carefully preserved, the Throne. The makers of new\r\nJapan understood that so long as the sanctity and inviolability of the\r\nimperial prerogatives could be preserved, the nation would be held by a\r\nstrong anchor from drifting into dangerous waters. They laboured under\r\nno misapprehension about the inevitable issue of their work in framing\r\nthe constitution. They knew very well that party cabinets are an\r\nessential outcome of representative institutions, and that to some kind\r\nof party cabinet Japan must come. But they regarded the Imperial mandate\r\nas a conservative safeguard, pending the organization and education of\r\nparties competent to form cabinets. Such parties did not yet exist, and\r\nuntil they came into unequivocal existence, the Restoration statesmen,\r\nwho had so successfully managed the affairs of the nation during a\r\nquarter of a century, resolved that the steady point furnished by the\r\nthrone must not be abandoned.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the agitators found here a new platform. They had\r\nobtained a constitution and a diet, but they had not obtained an\r\ninstrument for pulling down the \"clan\" administrators, since these stood\r\nsecure from attack under the aegis of the sovereign's mandate. They\r\ndared not raise their voices against the unfettered exercise of the\r\nmikado's prerogative. The nation, loyal to the core, would not have\r\nsuffered such a protest, nor could the agitators themselves have found\r\nheart to formulate it. But they could read their own interpretation into\r\nthe text of the Constitution, and they could demonstrate practically\r\nthat a cabinet not acknowledging responsibility to the legislature was\r\nvirtually impotent for law-making purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Diet and the Government.\r\n\r\nThese are the broad outlines of the contest that began in the first\r\nsession of the Diet and continued for several years. It is unnecessary\r\nto speak of the special points of controversy. Just as the political\r\nparties had been formed on the lines of persons, not principles, so the\r\nopposition in the Diet was directed against men, not measures. The\r\nstruggle presented varying aspects at different times, but the\r\nfundamental question at issue never changed. Obstruction was the weapon\r\nof the political parties. They sought to render legislation and finance\r\nimpossible for any ministry that refused to take its mandate from the\r\nmajority in the lower house, and they imparted an air of respectability\r\nand even patriotism to their destructive campaign by making\r\n\"anti-clannism\" their war-cry, and industriously fostering the idea that\r\nthe struggle lay between administration guided by public opinion and\r\nadministration controlled by a clique of clansmen who separated the\r\nthrone from the nation. Had not the House of Peers stood stanchly by the\r\ngovernment throughout this contest, it is possible that the nation might\r\nhave suffered severely from the rashness of the political parties.\r\n\r\nThere was something melancholy in the spectacle. The Restoration\r\nstatesmen were the men who had made Modern Japan; the men who had raised\r\nher, in the face of immense obstacles, from the position of an\r\ninsignificant Oriental state to that of a formidable unit in the comity\r\nof nations; the men, finally, who had given to her a constitution and\r\nrepresentative institutions. Yet these same men were now fiercely\r\nattacked by the arms which they had themselves nerved; were held up to\r\npublic obloquy as self-seeking usurpers, and were declared to be\r\nimpeding the people's constitutional route to administrative privileges,\r\nwhen in reality they were only holding the breach until the people\r\nshould be able to march into the citadel with some show of orderly and\r\ncompetent organization. That there was no corruption, no abuse of\r\nposition, is not to be pretended; but on the whole the conservatism of\r\nthe clan statesmen had only one object--to provide that the newly\r\nconstructed representative machine should not be set working until its\r\nparts were duly adjusted and brought into proper gear. On both sides the\r\nleaders understood the situation accurately. The heads of the parties,\r\nwhile publicly clamouring for parliamentary cabinets, privately\r\nconfessed that they were not yet prepared to assume administrative\r\nresponsibilities;[3] and the so-called \"clan statesmen,\" while refusing\r\nbefore the world to accept the Diet's mandates, admitted within official\r\ncircles that the question was one of time only. The situation did not\r\nundergo any marked change until, the country becoming engaged in war\r\nwith China (1894-95), domestic squabbles were forgotten in the presence\r\nof foreign danger. From that time an era of coalition commenced. Both\r\nthe political parties joined hands to vote funds for the prosecution of\r\nthe campaign, and one of them, the Liberals, subsequently gave support\r\nto a cabinet under the presidency of Marquis Ito, the purpose of the\r\nunion being to carry through the diet an extensive scheme of enlarged\r\narmaments and public works planned in the sequel of the war. The\r\nProgressists, however, remained implacable, continuing their opposition\r\nto the thing called bureaucracy quite irrespective of its measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Fusion of the Two Parties.\r\n\r\nThe next phase (1898) was a fusion of the two parties into one large\r\norganization which adopted the name \"Constitutional Party\"\r\n(_kensei-to_). By this union the chief obstacles to parliamentary\r\ncabinets were removed. Not only did the Constitutionalists command a\r\nlarge majority in the lower house, but also they possessed a sufficiency\r\nof men who, although lacking ministerial experience, might still advance\r\na reasonable title to be entrusted with portfolios. Immediately the\r\nemperor, acting on the advice of Marquis Ito, invited Counts Okuma and\r\nItagaki to form a cabinet. It was essentially a trial. The party\r\npoliticians were required to demonstrate in practice the justice of the\r\nclaim they had been so long asserting in theory. They had worked in\r\ncombination for the destructive purpose of pulling down the so-called\r\n\"clan statesmen\"; they had now to show whether they could work in\r\ncombination for the constructive purposes of administration. Their\r\nheads, Counts Okuma and Itagaki, accepted the Imperial mandate, and the\r\nnation watched the result. There was no need to wait long. In less than\r\nsix months these new links snapped under the tension of old enmities,\r\nand the coalition split up once more into its original elements. It had\r\ndemonstrated that the sweets of power, which the \"clan statesmen\" had\r\nbeen so vehemently accused of coveting, possessed even greater\r\nattractions for their accusers. The issue of the experiment was such a\r\npalpable fiasco that it effectually rehabilitated the \"clan statesmen,\"\r\nand finally proved, what had indeed been long evident to every close\r\nobserver, that without the assistance of those statesmen no political\r\nparty could hold office successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Enrolment of the Clan Statesmen in Political Associations.\r\n\r\nThenceforth it became the unique aim of Liberals and Progressists alike\r\nto join hands permanently with the men towards whom they had once\r\ndisplayed such implacable hostility. Prince Ito, the leader of the\r\nso-called \"elder statesmen,\" received special solicitations, for it was\r\nplain that he would bring to any political party an overwhelming access\r\nof strength alike in his own person and in the number of friends and\r\ndisciples certain to follow him. But Prince Ito declined to be absorbed\r\ninto any existing party, or to adopt the principle of parliamentary\r\ncabinets. He would consent to form a new association, but it must\r\nconsist of men sufficiently disciplined to obey him implicitly, and\r\nsufficiently docile to accept their programme from his hand. The\r\nLiberals agreed to these terms. They dissolved their party (August 1900)\r\nand enrolled themselves in the ranks of a new organization, which did\r\nnot even call itself a party, its designation being _rikken seiyu-kai_\r\n(association of friends of the constitution), and which had for the\r\ncardinal plank in its platform a declaration of ministerial\r\nirresponsibility to the Diet. A singular page was thus added to the\r\nstory of Japanese political development; for not merely did the Liberals\r\nenlist under the banner of the statesmen whom for twenty years they had\r\nfought to overthrow, but they also tacitly consented to erase from their\r\nprofession of faith its essential article, parliamentary cabinets, and,\r\nby resigning that article to the Progressists, created for the first\r\ntime an opposition with a solid and intelligible platform. Nevertheless\r\nthe seiyu-kai grew steadily in strength whereas the number of its\r\nopponents declined correspondingly. At the general elections in May 1908\r\nthe former secured 195 seats, the four sections of the opposition\r\nwinning only 184. Thus for the first time in Japanese parliamentary\r\nhistory a majority of the lower chamber found themselves marching under\r\nthe same banner. Moreover, the four sections of the opposition were\r\nindependently organized and differed nearly as much from one another as\r\nthey all differed from the seiyu-kai. Their impotence to make head\r\nagainst the solid phalanx of the latter was thus conspicuous, especially\r\nduring the 1908-1909 session of the Diet. Much talk then began to be\r\nheard about the necessity of coalition, and that this talk will\r\nmaterialize eventually cannot be doubted. Reduction of armaments,\r\nabolition of taxes specially imposed for belligerent purposes, and the\r\nsubstitution of a strictly constitutional system for the existing\r\nbureaucracy--these objects constitute a sufficiently solid platform, and\r\nnothing is wanted except that a body of proved administrators should\r\njoin the opposition in occupying it. There were in 1909 no signs,\r\nhowever, that any such defection from the ranks of officialdom would\r\ntake place. Deference is paid to public opinions inasmuch as even a\r\nseiyu-kai ministry will not remain in office after its popularity has\r\nbegun to show signs of waning. But no deference is paid to the doctrine\r\nof party cabinets. Prince Ito did not continue to lead the seiyu-kai for\r\nmore than three years. In July 1903 he delegated that function to\r\nMarquis Saionji, representative of one of the very oldest families of\r\nthe court nobility and a personal friend of the emperor, as also was\r\nPrince Ito. The Imperial stamp is thus vicariously set upon the\r\nprinciple of political combinations for the better practical conduct of\r\nparliamentary business, but that the seiyu-kai, founded by Prince Ito\r\nand led by Marquis Saionji, should ever hold office in defiance of the\r\nsovereign's mandate is unthinkable. Constitutional institutions in Japan\r\nare therefore developing along lines entirely without precedent. The\r\nstorm and stress of early parliamentary days have given place to\r\ncomparative calm. During the first twelve sessions of the Diet,\r\nextending over 8 years, there were five dissolutions of the lower house.\r\nDuring the next thirteen sessions, extending over 11 years, there were\r\ntwo dissolutions. During the first 8 years of the Diet's existence there\r\nwere six changes of cabinet; during the next 11 years there were five\r\nchanges. Another healthy sign was that men of affairs were beginning to\r\nrealize the importance of parliamentary representation. At first the\r\nconstituencies were contested almost entirely by professional\r\npoliticians, barristers and journalists. In 1909 there was a solid body\r\n(the _boshin_ club) of business men commanding nearly 50 votes in the\r\nlower house; and as the upper chamber included 45 representatives of the\r\nhighest tax-payers, the interests of commerce and industry were\r\nintelligently debated.     (F. By.)\r\n\r\n\r\nX.--THE CLAIM OF JAPAN: BY A JAPANESE STATESMAN[4]\r\n\r\nIt has been said that it is impossible for an Occidental to understand\r\nthe Oriental, and vice versa; but, admitting that the mutual\r\nunderstanding of two different races or peoples is a difficult matter,\r\nwhy should Occidentals and Orientals be thus set in opposition? No\r\ndoubt, different peoples of Europe understand each other better than\r\nthey do the Asiatic; but can Asiatic peoples understand each other\r\nbetter than they can Europeans or than the Europeans can understand any\r\nof them? Do Japanese understand Persians or even Indians better than\r\nEnglish or French? It is true perhaps that Japanese can and do\r\nunderstand the Chinese better than Europeans; but that is due not only\r\nto centuries of mutual intercourse, but to the wonderful and peculiar\r\nfact that they have adopted the old classical Chinese literature as\r\ntheir own, somewhat in the way, but in a much greater degree, in which\r\nthe European nations have adopted the old Greek and Latin literatures.\r\nWhat is here contended for is that the mutual understanding of two\r\npeoples is not so much a matter of race, but of the knowledge of each\r\nother's history, traditions, literature, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese have, they think, suffered much from the misunderstanding\r\nof their motives, feelings and ideas; what they want is to be understood\r\nfully and to be known for what they really are, be it good or bad. They\r\ndesire, above all, not to be lumped as Oriental, but to be known and\r\njudged on their own account. In the latter half of the 19th century, in\r\nfact up to the Chinese War, it irritated Japanese travelling abroad more\r\nthan anything else to be taken for Chinese. Then, after the Chinese War,\r\nthe alarm about Japan leading Eastern Asia to make a general attack upon\r\nEurope--the so-called Yellow Peril--seemed so ridiculous to the Japanese\r\nthat the bad effects of such wild talk were not quite appreciated by\r\nthem. The aim of the Japanese nation, ever since, at the time of the\r\nRestoration (1868), they laid aside definitively all ideas of seclusion\r\nand entered into the comity of nations, has been that they should rise\r\nabove the level of the Eastern peoples to an equality with the Western\r\nand should be in the foremost rank of the brotherhood of nations; it was\r\nnot their ambition at all to be the champion of the East against the\r\nWest, but rather to beat down the barriers between themselves and the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nThe intense pride of the Japanese in their nationality, their patriotism\r\nand loyalty, arise from their history, for what other nation can point\r\nto an Imperial family of one unbroken lineage reigning over the land for\r\ntwenty-five centuries? Is it not a glorious tradition for a nation, that\r\nits emperor should be descended directly from that grandson of \"the\r\ngreat heaven-illuminating goddess,\" to whom she said, \"This land\r\n(Japan) is the region over which my descendants shall be the lords. Do\r\nthou, my august child, proceed thither and govern it. Go! _The\r\nprosperity of thy dynasty shall be coeval with heaven and earth._\" Thus\r\nthey call their country the land of _kami_ (ancient gods of tradition).\r\nWith this spirit, in the old days when China held the hegemony of the\r\nEast, and all neighbouring peoples were regarded as its tributaries,\r\nJapan alone, largely no doubt on account of its insular position, held\r\nitself quite aloof; it set at defiance the power of Kublai and routed\r\nutterly the combined Chinese and Korean fleets with vast forces sent by\r\nhim to conquer Japan, this being the only occasion that Japan was\r\nthreatened with a foreign invasion.\r\n\r\nWith this spirit, as soon as they perceived the superiority of the\r\nWestern civilization, they set to work to introduce it into their\r\ncountry, just as in the 7th and 8th centuries they had adopted and\r\nadapted the Chinese civilization. In 1868, the first year of the era of\r\nMeiji, the emperor swore solemnly the memorable oath of five articles,\r\nsetting forth the policy that was to be and has been followed thereafter\r\nby the government. These five articles were:--\r\n\r\n  1. Deliberative assemblies shall be established and all measures of\r\n  government shall be decided by public opinion.\r\n\r\n  2. All classes, high and low, shall unite in vigorously carrying out\r\n  the plan of government.\r\n\r\n  3. Officials, civil and military, and all common people shall as far\r\n  as possible be allowed to fulfil their just desires so that there may\r\n  not be any discontent among them.\r\n\r\n  4. _Uncivilized customs of former times shall be broken through_, and\r\n  everything shall be based upon just and equitable principles of heaven\r\n  and earth (nature).\r\n\r\n  5. _Knowledge shall be sought for throughout the world_, so that the\r\n  welfare of the empire may be promoted.\r\n\r\n  (Translation due to Prof. N. Hozumi of Tokyo Imp. Univ.)\r\n\r\nIt is interesting, as showing the continuity of the policy of the\r\nempire, to place side by side with these articles the words of the\r\nImperial rescript issued in 1908, which are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  \"We are convinced that with the rapid and unceasing advance of\r\n  civilization, the East and West, mutually dependent and helping each\r\n  other, are bound by common interests. It is our sincere wish to\r\n  continue to enjoy for ever its benefits in common with other powers by\r\n  entering into closer and closer relations and strengthening our\r\n  friendship with them. Now in order to be able to move onward along\r\n  with the constant progress of the world and to share in the blessings\r\n  of civilization, it is obvious that we must develop our internal\r\n  resources; our nation, but recently emerged from an exhausting war,\r\n  must put forth increased activity in every branch of administration.\r\n  It therefore behoves our people to endeavour with one mind, from the\r\n  highest to the lowest, to pursue their callings honestly and\r\n  earnestly, to be industrious and thrifty, to abide in faith and\r\n  righteousness, to be simple and warm-hearted, to put away ostentation\r\n  and vanity and strive after the useful and solid, to avoid idleness\r\n  and indulgence, and to apply themselves incessantly to strenuous and\r\n  arduous tasks....\"\r\n\r\nThe ambition of the Japanese people has been, as already stated, to be\r\nrecognized as an equal by the Great Powers. With this object in view,\r\nthey have spared no efforts to introduce what they considered superior\r\nin the Western civilization, although it may perhaps be doubted whether\r\nin their eagerness they have always been wise. _They have always\r\nresented any discrimination against them as an Asiatic people_, not\r\nmerely protesting against it, knowing that such would not avail much,\r\nbut making every endeavour to remove reasons or excuses for it. Formerly\r\nthere were troops stationed to guard several legations; foreign postal\r\nservice was not entirely in the hands of the Japanese government for a\r\nlong time; these and other indignities against the sovereignty of the\r\nnation were gradually removed by proving that they were not necessary.\r\nThen there was the question of the extra-territorial jurisdiction; an\r\nembassy was sent to Europe and America as early as 1871 with a view to\r\nthe revision of treaties in order to do away with this _imperium in\r\nimperio_, that being the date originally fixed for the revision; the\r\nembassy, however, failed in its object but was not altogether fruitless,\r\nfor it was then clearly seen that it would be necessary to revise\r\nthoroughly the system of laws and entirely to reorganize the law courts\r\nbefore Occidental nations could be induced to forgo this privilege.\r\nThese measures were necessary in any case as a consequence of the\r\nintroduction of the Western methods and ideas, but they were hastened by\r\nthe fact of their being a necessary preliminary to the revision of\r\ntreaties. When the new code of laws was brought before the Diet at its\r\nfirst session, and there was a great opposition against it in the House\r\nof Peers on account of its many defects and especially of its ignoring\r\nmany established usages, the chief argument in its favour, or at least\r\none that had a great influence with many who were unacquainted with\r\ntechnical points, was that it was necessary for the revision of treaties\r\nand that the defects, if any, could be afterwards amended at leisure.\r\nThese preparations on the part of the government, however, took a long\r\ntime, and in the meantime the whole nation, or at least the more\r\nintelligent part of it, was chafing impatiently under what was\r\nconsidered a national indignity. The United States, by being the first\r\nto agree to its abandonment, although this agreement was rendered\r\nnugatory by a conditional clause, added to the stock of goodwill with\r\nwhich the Japanese have always regarded the Americans on account of\r\ntheir attitude towards them. When at last the consummation so long and\r\nardently desired was attained, great was the joy with which it was\r\ngreeted, for now it was felt that Japan was indeed on terms of equality\r\nwith Occidental nations. Great Britain, by being the first to conclude\r\nthe revised treaty--an act due to the remarkable foresight of her\r\nstatesmen in spite of the opposition of their countrymen in Japan--did\r\nmuch to bring about the cordial feeling of the Japanese towards the\r\nBritish, which made them welcome with such enthusiasm the Anglo-Japanese\r\nalliance. The importance of this last as a powerful instrument for the\r\npreservation of peace in the extreme East has been, and always will be,\r\nappreciated at its full value by the more intelligent and thoughtful\r\namong the Japanese; but by the mass of the people it was received with\r\ngreat acclamation, owing partly to the already existing good feeling\r\ntowards the British, but also in a large measure because it was felt\r\nthat the fact that Great Britain should leave its \"splendid isolation\"\r\nto enter into this alliance proclaimed in the clearest possible way that\r\nJapan had entered on terms of full equality among the brotherhood of\r\nnations, and that thenceforth there could be no ground for that\r\ndiscrimination against them as an Asiatic nation which had been so\r\ngalling to the Japanese people.\r\n\r\nThere have been, and there still are being made, many charges against\r\nthe Japanese government and people. While admitting that some of them\r\nmay be founded on facts, it is permissible to point out that traits and\r\nacts of a few individuals have often been generalized to be the national\r\ncharacteristic or the result of a fixed policy, while in many cases such\r\ncharges are due to misunderstandings arising from want of thorough\r\nknowledge of each other's language, customs, usages, ideas, &c. Take the\r\nprinciple of \"the open door,\" for instance; the Japanese government has\r\nbeen charged in several instances with acting contrary to it. It is\r\nnatural that where (as in China) competition is very keen between men of\r\ndifferent nationalities, individuals should sometimes feel aggrieved and\r\nmake complaints of unfairness against the government of their\r\ncompetitors; it is also natural that people at home should listen to and\r\nbelieve in those charges made against the Japanese by their countrymen\r\nin the East, while unfortunately the Japanese, being so far away and\r\noften unaware of them, have not a ready means of vindicating themselves;\r\nbut subsequent investigations have always shown those charges to be\r\neither groundless or due to misunderstandings, and it may be asserted\r\nthat in no case has the charge been substantiated that the Japanese\r\ngovernment has knowingly, deliberately, of _malice prepense_ been guilty\r\nof breach of faith in violating the principle of \"the open door\" to\r\nwhich it has solemnly pledged itself. That it has often been accused by\r\nthe Japanese subjects of weakness _vis-à-vis_ foreign powers to the\r\ndetriment of their interests, is perhaps a good proof of its fairness.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese have often been charged with looseness of commercial\r\nmorality. This charge is harder to answer than the last, for it cannot\r\nbe denied that there have been many instances of dishonesty on the part\r\nof Japanese tradesmen or employees; _tu quoque_ is never a valid\r\nargument, but there are black sheep everywhere, and there were special\r\nreasons why foreigners should have come in contact with many such in\r\ntheir dealings with the Japanese. In days before the Restoration,\r\nmerchants and tradesmen were officially classed as the lowest of four\r\nclasses, the samurai, the farmers, the artisans and the merchants;\r\npractically, however, rich merchants serving as bankers and employers of\r\nothers were held in high esteem, even by the samurai. Yet it cannot be\r\ndenied that the position of the last three was low compared with that of\r\nthe samurai; their education was not so high, and although of course\r\nthere was the same code of morality for them all, there was no such high\r\nstandard of honour as was enjoined upon the samurai by the bushido or\r\n\"the way of samurai.\" Now, when foreign trade was first opened, it was\r\nnaturally not firms with long-established credit and methods that first\r\nventured upon the new field of business--some few that did failed owing\r\nto their want of experience--it was rather enterprising and adventurous\r\nspirits with little capital or credit who eagerly flocked to the newly\r\nopened ports to try their fortune. It was not to be expected that all or\r\nmost of those should be very scrupulous in their dealings with the\r\nforeigners; the majority of those adventurers failed, while a few of the\r\nabler men, generally those who believed in and practised honesty as the\r\nbest policy, succeeded and came to occupy an honourable position as\r\nbusiness men. It is also asserted that foreigners, or at least some of\r\nthem, did not scruple to take unfair advantage of the want of experience\r\non the part of their Japanese customers to impose upon them methods\r\nwhich they would not have followed except in the East; it may be that\r\nsuch methods were necessary or were deemed so in dealing with those\r\nadventurers, but it is a fact that it afterwards took a long time and\r\ngreat effort on the part of Japanese traders to break through some\r\nusages and customs which were established in earlier days and which they\r\ndeemed derogatory to their credit or injurious to their interests.\r\nInfringement of patent rights and fraudulent imitation of trade-marks\r\nhave with some truth also been charged against the Japanese; about this\r\nit is to be remarked that although the principles of morality cannot\r\nchange, their applications may be new; patents and trade-marks are\r\nsomething new to the Japanese, and it takes time to teach that their\r\ninfringement should be regarded with the same moral censure as stealing.\r\nThe government has done everything to prevent such practices by enacting\r\nand enforcing laws against them, and nowadays they are not so common. Be\r\nthat as it may, such a state of affairs as that mentioned above is now\r\npassing away almost entirely; commerce and trade are now regarded as\r\nhighly honourable professions, merchants and business men occupy the\r\nhighest social positions, several of them having been lately raised to\r\nthe peerage, and are as honourable a set of men as can be met anywhere.\r\nIt is however to be regretted that in introducing Western business\r\nmethods, it has not been quite possible to exclude some of their evils,\r\nsuch as promotion of swindling companies, tampering with members of\r\nlegislature, and so forth.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese have also been considered in some quarters to be a\r\nbellicose nation. No sooner was the war with Russia over than they were\r\nsaid to be ready and eager to fight with the United States. This is\r\nanother misrepresentation arising from want of proper knowledge of\r\nJapanese character and feelings. Although it is true that within the\r\nquarter of a century preceding 1909 Japan was engaged in two sanguinary\r\nwars, not to mention the Boxer affair, in which owing to her proximity\r\nto the scene of the disturbances she had to take a prominent part, yet\r\nneither of these was of her own seeking; in both cases she had to fight\r\nor else submit to become a mere cipher in the world, if indeed she could\r\nhave preserved her existence as an independent state. The Japanese, far\r\nfrom being a bellicose people, deliberately cut off all intercourse with\r\nthe outside world in order to avoid international troubles, and remained\r\nabsolutely secluded from the world and at profound peace within their\r\nown territory for two centuries and a half. Besides, the Japanese have\r\nalways regarded the Americans with a special goodwill, due no doubt to\r\nthe steady liberal attitude of the American government and people\r\ntowards Japan and Japanese, and they look upon the idea of war between\r\nJapan and the United States as ridiculous.\r\n\r\nRestrictions upon Japanese emigrants to the United States and to\r\nAustralia are irritating to the Japanese, because it is a discrimination\r\nagainst them as belonging to the \"yellow\" race, whereas it has been\r\ntheir ambition to raise themselves above the level of the Eastern\r\nnations to an equality with the Western nations, although they cannot\r\nchange the colour of their skin. When a Japanese even of the highest\r\nrank and standing has to obtain a permit from an American immigrant\r\nofficer before he can enter American territory, is it not natural that\r\nhe and his countrymen should resent this discrimination as an indignity?\r\nBut they have too much good sense to think or even dream of going to war\r\nupon such a matter; on the contrary, the Japanese government agreed in\r\n1908 to limit the number of emigrants in order to avoid complications.\r\n\r\nIt may be repeated that it has ever been the ambition of the Japanese\r\npeople to take rank with the Great Powers of the world, and to have a\r\nvoice in the council of nations; they demand that they shall not be\r\ndiscriminated against because of the colour of their skin, but that they\r\nshall rather be judged by their deeds. With this aim, they have made\r\ngreat efforts: where charges brought against them have any foundation in\r\nfact, they have endeavoured to make reforms; where they are false or due\r\nto misunderstandings they have tried to live them down, trusting to time\r\nfor their vindication. They are willing to be judged by the intelligent\r\nand impartial world: a fair field and no favour is what they claim, and\r\nthink they have a right to claim, from the world.

B._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAPANNING, the art of coating surfaces of metal, wood, &c., with a\r\nvariety of varnishes, which are dried and hardened on in stoves or hot\r\nchambers. These drying processes constitute the main distinguishing\r\nfeatures of the art. The trade owes its name to the fact that it is an\r\nimitation of the famous lacquering of Japan (see JAPAN: _Art_), which,\r\nhowever, is prepared with entirely different materials and processes,\r\nand is in all respects much more brilliant, durable and beautiful than\r\nany ordinary japan work. Japanning is done in clear transparent\r\nvarnishes, in black and in body colours; but black japan is the most\r\ncharacteristic and common style of work. The varnish for black japan\r\nconsists essentially of pure natural asphaltum with a proportion of gum\r\nanimé dissolved in linseed oil and thinned with turpentine. In thin\r\nlayers such a japan has a rich dark brown colour; it only shows a\r\nbrilliant black in thicker coatings. For fine work, which has to be\r\nsmoothed and polished, several coats of black are applied in succession,\r\neach being separately dried in the stove at a heat which may rise to\r\nabout 300° F. Body colours consist of a basis of transparent varnish\r\nmixed with the special mineral paints of the desired colours or with\r\nbronze powders. The transparent varnish used by japanners is a copal\r\nvarnish which contains less drying oil and more turpentine than is\r\ncontained in ordinary painters' oil varnish. Japanning produces a\r\nbrilliant polished surface which is much more durable and less easily\r\naffected by heat, moisture or other influences than any ordinary painted\r\nand varnished work. It may be regarded as a process intermediate between\r\nordinary painting and enamelling. It is very extensively applied in the\r\nfinishing of ordinary iron-mongery goods and domestic iron-work, deed\r\nboxes, clock dials and papier-mâché articles. The process is also\r\napplied to blocks of slate for making imitation of black and other\r\nmarbles for chimneypieces, &c., and in a modified form is employed for\r\npreparing enamelled, japan or patent leather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAPHETH ([Hebrew: Yefeth]), in the Bible, the youngest son of Noah[1]\r\naccording to the Priestly Code (c. 450 B.C.); but in the earlier\r\ntradition[2] the second son, also the \"father\" of one of the three\r\ngroups into which the nations of the world are divided.[3] In Gen. ix.\r\n27, Noah pronounces the following blessing on Japheth--\r\n\r\n  \"God enlarge (Heb. _yapht_) Japheth (Heb. _yepheth_),\r\n   And let him dwell in the tents of Shem;\r\n   And let Canaan be his servant.\"\r\n\r\nThis is probably an ancient oracle independent alike of the flood story\r\nand the genealogical scheme in Gen. x. Shem is probably Israel; Canaan,\r\nof course, the Canaanites; by analogy, Japheth should be some third\r\nelement of the population of Palestine--the Philistines or the\r\nPhoenicians have been suggested. The sense of the second line is\r\ndoubtful, it may be \"let God dwell\" or \"let Japheth dwell\"; on the\r\nlatter view Japheth appears to be in friendly alliance with Shem. The\r\nwords might mean that Japheth was an intruding invader, but this is not\r\nconsonant with the tone of the oracle. Possibly Japheth is only present\r\nin Gen. ix. 20-27 through corruption of the text, Japheth may be an\r\naccidental repetition of yapht \"may he enlarge,\" misread as a proper\r\nname.\r\n\r\nIn Gen. x. Japheth is the northern and western division of the nations;\r\nbeing perhaps used as a convenient title under which to group the more\r\nremote peoples who were not thought of as standing in ethnic or\r\npolitical connexion with Israel or Egypt. Thus of his descendants,\r\nGomer, Magog,[4] Tubal, Meshech, Ashkenaz, Riphath and Togarmah are\r\npeoples who are located with more or less certainty in N.E. Asia Minor,\r\nArmenia and the lands to the N.E. of the Black Sea; Javan is the\r\nIonians, used loosely for the seafaring peoples of the West, including\r\nTarshish (Tartessus in Spain), Kittim (Cyprus), Rodanim[5] (Rhodes).\r\nThere is no certain identification of Tiras and Elishah.\r\n\r\n  The similarity of the name Japheth to the Titan Iapetos of Greek\r\n  mythology is probably a mere accident. A place Japheth is mentioned in\r\n  Judith ii. 25, but it is quite unknown.\r\n\r\n  In addition to commentaries and dictionary articles, see E.

The word came into English\r\nthrough Fr. _jarre_ or Span, _jarra_, from Arab, _jarrah_, the\r\nearthenware vessel of Eastern countries, used to contain water, oil,\r\nwine, &c. The simple electrical condenser known as a _Leyden Jar_ (q.v.)\r\nwas so called because of the early experiments made in the science of\r\nelectricity at Leiden. In the sense of a harsh vibrating sound, a sudden\r\nshock or vibrating movement, hence dissension, quarrel or petty strife,\r\n\"jar\" is onomatopoeic in origin; it is also seen in the name of the bird\r\nnight-jar (also known as the goat-sucker). In the expression \"on the\r\njar\" or \"ajar,\" of a door or window partly open, the word is another\r\nform of _chare_ or _char_, meaning turn or turning, which survives in\r\ncharwoman, one who works at a turn, a job and _chore_, a job, spell of\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJARGON, in its earliest use a term applied to the chirping and\r\ntwittering of birds, but since the 15th century mainly confined to any\r\nlanguage, spoken or written, which is either unintelligible to the user\r\nor to the hearer. It is particularly applied by uninstructed hearers or\r\nreaders to the language full of technical terminology used by\r\nscientific, philosophic and other writers. The word is O. Fr., and\r\nCotgrave defines it as \"gibridge (gibberish), fustian language.\" It is\r\ncognate with Span. _gerigonza_, and Ital. _gergo_, _gergone_, and\r\nprobably related to the onomatopoeic O. Fr. _jargouiller_, to chatter.\r\nThe root is probably seen in Lat. _garrire_, to chatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJARGOON, or Jargon (occasionally in old writings _jargounce_ and\r\n_jacounce_), a name applied by modern mineralogists to those zircons\r\nwhich are fine enough to be cut as gem-stones, but are not of the red\r\ncolour which characterizes the hyacinth or jacinth. The word is related\r\nto Arab _zargun_ (zircon). Some of the finest jargoons are green, others\r\nbrown and yellow, whilst some are colourless. The colourless jargoon may\r\nbe obtained by heating certain coloured stones. When zircon is heated it\r\nsometimes changes in colour, or altogether loses it, and at the same\r\ntime usually increases in density and brilliancy. The so-called Matura\r\ndiamonds, formerly sent from Matara (or Matura), in Ceylon, were\r\ndecolorized zircons. The zircon has strong refractive power, and its\r\nlustre is almost adamantine, but it lacks the fire of the diamond. The\r\nspecific gravity of zircon is subject to considerable variation in\r\ndifferent varieties; thus Sir A. H. Church found the sp. gr. of a fine\r\nleaf-green jargoon to be as low as 3.982, and that of a pure white\r\njargoon as high as 4.705. Jargoon and tourmaline, when cut as gems, are\r\nsometimes mistaken for each other, but the sp. gr. is distinctive, since\r\nthat of tourmaline is only 3 to 3.2. Moreover, in tourmaline the\r\ndichroism is strongly marked, whereas in jargoon it is remarkably\r\nfeeble. The refractive indices of jargoon are much higher than those of\r\ntourmaline (see ZIRCON).     (F. W. R.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJARIR IBN 'ATIYYA UL-KHATFI (d. 728), Arabian poet, was born in the\r\nreign of the caliph 'Ali, was a member of the tribe Kulaib, a part of\r\nthe Tamim, and lived in Irak. Of his early life little is known, but he\r\nsucceeded in winning the favour of Hajjaj, the governor of Irak (see\r\nCALIPHATE). Already famous for his verse, he became more widely known by\r\nhis feud with Farazdaq and Akhtal. Later he went to Damascus and visited\r\nthe court of Abdalmalik ('Abd ul-Malik) and that of his successor,\r\nWalid. From neither of these did he receive a warm welcome. He was,\r\nhowever, more successful with Omar II., and was the only poet received\r\nby the pious caliph.\r\n\r\n  His verse, which, like that of his contemporaries, is largely satire\r\n  and eulogy, was published in 2 vols. (Cairo, 1896).     (G. W. T.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJARKENT, a town of Russian Central Asia, in the province of\r\nSemiryechensk, 70 m. W.N.W. of Kulja and near to the Ili river. Pop.\r\n(1897), 16,372.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJARNAC, a town of western France in the department of Charente, on the\r\nright bank of the river Charente, and on the railway 23 m. W. of\r\nAngoulême, between that city and Cognac. Pop. (1906), 4493. The town is\r\nwell built; and an avenue, planted with poplar trees, leads to a\r\nhandsome suspension bridge. The church contains an interesting ogival\r\ncrypt. There are communal colleges for both sexes. Brandy, wine and\r\nwine-casks are made in the town. Jarnac was in 1569 the scene of a\r\nbattle in which the Catholics defeated the Protestants. A pyramid marks\r\nthe spot where Louis, Prince de Condé, one of the Protestant generals,\r\nwas slain. Jarnac gave its name to an old French family, of which the\r\nbest known member is Gui Chabot, comte de Jarnac (d. c. 1575), whose\r\nlucky backstroke in his famous duel with Châteigneraie gave rise to the\r\nproverbial phrase _coup de jarnac_, signifying an unexpected blow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJARO, a town of the province of Iloílo, Panay, Philippine Islands, on\r\nthe Jaro river, 2 m. N.W. of the town of Iloílo, the capital. Pop.\r\n(1903), 10,681. It lies on a plain in the midst of a rich agricultural\r\ndistrict, has several fine residences, a cathedral, a curious\r\nthree-tiered tower, a semi-weekly paper and a monthly periodical. Jaro\r\nwas founded by the Spanish in 1584. From 1903 until February 1908 it was\r\npart of the town or municipality of Iloílo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAROSITE, a rare mineral species consisting of hydrous potassium and\r\naluminium sulphate, and belonging to the group of isomorphous\r\nrhombohedral minerals enumerated below:--\r\n\r\n  Alunite          K2   [Al(OH)2]6 (SO4)4\r\n  Jarosite         K2   [Fe(OH)2]6 (SO4)4\r\n  Natrojarosite    Na2  [Fe(OH)2]6 (SO4)4\r\n  Plumbojarosite   Pb   [Fe(OH)2]8 (SO4)4\r\n\r\nJarosite usually occurs as drusy incrustations of minute indistinct\r\ncrystals with a yellowish-brown colour and brilliant lustre. Hardness 3;\r\nsp. gr. 3.15. The best specimens, consisting of crystalline crusts on\r\nlimonite, are from the Jaroso ravine in the Sierra Almagrera, province\r\nof Almeria, Spain, from which locality the mineral receives its name. It\r\nhas been also found, often in association with iron ores, at a few other\r\nlocalities. A variety occurring as concretionary or mulberry-like forms\r\nis known as moronolite (from Gr. [Greek: môron], \"mulberry,\" and [Greek:\r\nlíthos], \"stone\"); it is found at Monroe in Orange county, New York. The\r\nrecently discovered species natrojarosite and plumbojarosite occur as\r\nyellowish-brown glistening powders consisting wholly of minute crystals,\r\nand are from Nevada and New Mexico respectively.     (L. J. S.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJARRAH WOOD (an adaptation of the native name _Jerryhl_), the product of\r\na large tree (_Eucalyptus marginata_) found in south-western Australia,\r\nwhere it is said to cover an area of 14,000 sq. m. The trees grow\r\nstraight in the stem to a great size, and yield squared timber up to 40\r\nft. length and 24 in. diameter. The wood is very hard, heavy (sp. gr.\r\n1.010) and close-grained, with a mahogany-red colour, and sometimes\r\nsufficient \"figure\" to render it suitable for cabinet-makers' use. The\r\ntimber possesses several useful characteristics; and great expectations\r\nwere at first formed as to its value for ship-building and general\r\nconstructive purposes. These expectations have not, however, been\r\nrealized, and the exclusive possession of the tree has not proved that\r\nsource of wealth to western Australia which was at one time expected.\r\nIts greatest merit for ship-building and marine purposes is due to the\r\nfact that it resists, better than any other timber, the attacks of the\r\n_Teredo navalis_ and other marine borers, and on land it is equally\r\nexempt, in tropical countries, from the ravages of white ants. When\r\nfelled with the sap at its lowest point and well seasoned, the wood\r\nstands exposure in the air, earth or sea remarkably well, on which\r\naccount it is in request for railway sleepers, telegraph poles and piles\r\nin the British colonies and India. The wood, however, frequently shows\r\nlongitudinal blisters, or lacunae, filled with resin, the same as may be\r\nobserved in spruce fir timber; and it is deficient in fibre, breaking\r\nwith a short fracture under comparatively moderate pressure. It has been\r\nclassed at Lloyds for ship-building purposes in line three, table A, of\r\nthe registry rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJARROW, a port and municipal borough in the Jarrow parliamentary\r\ndivision of Durham, England, on the right bank of the Tyne, 6½ m. below\r\nNewcastle, and on a branch of the North-Eastern railway. Pop. (1901),\r\n34,295. The parish church of St Paul was founded in 685, and retains\r\nportions of pre-Norman work. The central tower is Norman, and there are\r\ngood Decorated and Perpendicular details in the body of the church.\r\nClose by are the scattered ruins of the monastery begun by the pious\r\nBiscop in 681, and consecrated with the church by Ceolfrid in 685.\r\nWithin the walls of this monastery the Venerable Bede spent his life\r\nfrom childhood; and his body was at first buried within the church,\r\nwhither, until it was removed under Edward the Confessor to Durham, it\r\nattracted many pilgrims. The town is wholly industrial, devoted to\r\nship-building, chemical works, paper mills and the neighbouring\r\ncollieries. It owes its development from a mere pit village very largely\r\nto the enterprise of Sir Charles Mark Palmer (q.v.). Jarrow Slake, a\r\nriver bay, 1 m. long by ½ m. broad, contains the Tyne docks of the\r\nNorth-Eastern railway company. A great quantity of coal is shipped.\r\nJarrow was incorporated in 1875, and the corporation consists of a\r\nmayor, 6 aldermen and 18 councillors. Area, 783 acres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJARRY, NICOLAS, one of the best-known 17th century French calligraphers.\r\nHe was born at Paris about 1620, and was officially employed by Louis\r\nXIV. His most famous work is the _Guirlande de Julie_ (1641). He died\r\nsome time before 1674.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJARVIS, JOHN WESLEY (1780-1840), American artist, nephew of the great\r\nJohn Wesley, was born at South Shields, England, and was taken to the\r\nUnited States at the age of five. He was one of the earliest American\r\npainters to give serious attention to the study of anatomy. He lived at\r\nfirst in Philadelphia, afterwards establishing himself in New York,\r\nwhere he enjoyed great popularity, though his conviviality and eccentric\r\nmode of life affected his work. He visited Baltimore, Charleston and New\r\nOrleans, entertaining much and painting portraits of prominent people,\r\nparticularly in New Orleans, where General Andrew Jackson was one of his\r\nsitters. He had for assistants at different times both Sully and Inman.\r\nHe affected singularity in dress and manners, and his _mots_ were the\r\ntalk of the day. But his work deteriorated, and he died in great poverty\r\nin New York City. Examples of his painting are in the collection of the\r\nNew York Historical Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJASHAR, BOOK OF, in Hebrew _Sepher ha-yashar_, a Hebrew composition\r\nmentioned as though well-known in Josh. x. 13 and 2 Sam. i. 18. From\r\nthese two passages it seems to have been a book of songs relating to\r\nimportant events, but no early collection of the kind is now extant, nor\r\nis anything known of it. Various speculations have been put forward as\r\nto the name: (1) that it means the book of the upright, i.e. Israel or\r\ndistinguished Israelites, the root being the same as in Jeshurun; (2)\r\nthat Jashar ([Hebrew: yashar]) is a transposition of shîr ([Hebrew:\r\nshir], song); (3) that it should be pointed Yashir ([Hebrew: yashir],\r\nsing; cf. Exod. xv. 1) and was so called after its first word. None of\r\nthese is very convincing, though support may be found for them all in\r\nthe versions. The Septuagint favours (1) by its rendering [Greek: epi\r\nbibliou tou euthous] in Samuel (it omits the words in Joshua); the\r\nVulgate has _in libro justorum_ in both places; the Syriac in Samuel has\r\n_Ashir_, which suggests a Hebrew reading _ha-shir_ (the song), and in\r\nJoshua it translates \"book of praises.\" The Targum on both passages has\r\n\"book of the law,\" an explanation which is followed by the chief Jewish\r\ncommentators, making the incidents the fulfilment of passages in the\r\nPentateuch. Since it contained the lament of David (2 Sam. i. 18) it\r\ncannot have been completed till after his time. If Wellhausen's\r\nrestoration of 1 Kings viii. 12 be accepted (from Septuagint 1 Kings\r\nviii. 53, [Greek: en bibliô tês ôdês]) where the reference is to the\r\nbuilding of the Temple, the book must have been growing in the time of\r\nSolomon. The attempt of Donaldson[1] to reconstruct it is largely\r\nsubjective and uncritical.\r\n\r\n  In later times when it became customary to compose midrashic works\r\n  under well-known names, a book of Jashar naturally made its\r\n  appearance. It need hardly be remarked that this has nothing whatever\r\n  to do with the older book. It is an anonymous elaboration in Hebrew of\r\n  the early part of the biblical narrative, probably composed in the\r\n  12th century. The fact that its legendary material is drawn from\r\n  Arabic sources, as well as from Talmud, Midrash and later Jewish\r\n  works, would seem to show that the writer lived in Spain, or,\r\n  according to others, in south Italy. The first edition appeared at\r\n  Venice in 1625, and it has been frequently printed since. It was\r\n  translated into English by (or for) M. M. Noah (New York, 1840). A\r\n  work called _The Book of ... Jasher, translated ... by Alcuin_ (1751;\r\n  2nd ed., Bristol, 1829), has nothing to do with this or with any\r\n  Hebrew original, but is a mere fabrication by the printer, Jacob Hive,\r\n  who put it forward as the book \"mentioned in Holy Scripture.\"\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--M.

The country is divided almost\r\nequally into high and low lands. The Uparghat plateau on the east rises\r\n2200 ft. above sea-level, and the hills above it reach their highest\r\npoint in Ranijula (3527 ft.).

His father, who was a tailor,\r\nhad a certain facility for making doggerel verses, which he sang or\r\nrecited at fairs and such-like popular gatherings; and Jacques, who used\r\ngenerally to accompany him, was thus early familiarized with the part\r\nwhich he afterwards so successfully filled himself. When sixteen years\r\nof age he found employment at a hairdresser's shop, and subsequently\r\nstarted a similar business of his own on the Gravier at Agen. In 1825 he\r\npublished his first volume of _Papillotos_ (\"Curl Papers\"), containing\r\npoems in French (a language he used with a certain sense of restraint),\r\nand in the familiar Agen _patois_--the popular speech of the working\r\nclasses--in which he was to achieve all his literary triumphs. Jasmin\r\nwas the most famous forerunner in Provençal literature (q.v.) of Mistral\r\nand the _Félibrige_. His influence in rehabilitating, for literary\r\npurposes, his native dialect, was particularly exercised in the public\r\nrecitals of his poems to which he devoted himself. His poetic gift, and\r\nhis flexible voice and action, fitted him admirably for this double rôle\r\nof troubadour and jongleur. In 1835 he recited his \"Blind Girl of\r\nCastel-Cuillé\" at Bordeaux, in 1836 at Toulouse; and he met with an\r\nenthusiastic reception in both those important cities. Most of his\r\npublic recitations were given for benevolent purposes, the proceeds\r\nbeing contributed by him to the restoration of the church of Vergt and\r\nother good works. Four successive volumes of _Papillotos_ were published\r\nduring his lifetime, and contained amongst others the following\r\nremarkable poems, quoted in order: \"The Charivari,\" \"My Recollections\"\r\n(supplemented after an interval of many years), \"The Blind Girl,\"\r\n\"Françounetto,\" \"Martha the Simple,\" and \"The Twin Brothers.\" With the\r\nexception of \"The Charivari,\" these are all touching pictures of humble\r\nlife--in most cases real episodes--carefully elaborated by the poet till\r\nthe graphic descriptions, full of light and colour, and the admirably\r\nvaried and melodious verse, seem too spontaneous and easy to have cost\r\nan effort. Jasmin was not a prolific writer, and, in spite of his\r\nimpetuous nature, would work a long time at one poem, striving to\r\nrealize every feeling he wished to describe, and give it its most lucid\r\nand natural expression. A verse from his spirited poem, \"The Third of\r\nMay,\" written in honour of Henry IV., and published in the first volume\r\nof _Papillotos_, is engraved on the base of the statue erected to that\r\nking at Nérac. In 1852 Jasmin's works were crowned by the Académie\r\nFrançaise, and a pension was awarded him. The medal struck on the\r\noccasion bore the inscription: _Au poëte moral et populaire_. His title\r\nof \"Maistre ès Jeux\" is a distinction only conferred by the academy of\r\nToulouse on illustrious writers. Pius IX. sent him the insignia of a\r\nknight of St Gregory the Great, and he was made chevalier of the Legion\r\nof Honour. He spent the latter years of his life on a small estate which\r\nhe had bought near Agen and named \"Papillotos,\" and which he describes\r\nin _Ma Bigno_ (\"My Vine\"). Though invited to represent his native city,\r\nhe refused to do so, preferring the pleasures and leisure of a country\r\nlife, and wisely judging that he was no really eligible candidate for\r\nelectoral honours. He died on the 4th of October 1864. His last poem, an\r\nanswer to Renan, was placed between his folded hands in his coffin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJASMINE, or JESSAMINE, botanically _Jasminum_, a genus of shrubs or\r\nclimbers constituting the principal part of the tribe Jasminoideae of\r\nthe natural order Oleaceae, and comprising about 150 species, of which\r\n40 or more occur in the gardens of Britain. The plants of the genus are\r\nmostly natives of the warmer regions of the Old World; there is one\r\nSouth American species. The leaves are pinnate or ternate, or sometimes\r\napparently simple, consisting of one leaflet, articulated to the\r\npetiole. The flowers, usually white or yellow, are arranged in terminal\r\nor axillary panicles, and have a tubular 5- or 8-cleft calyx, a\r\ncylindrical corolla-tube, with a spreading limb, two included stamens\r\nand a two-celled ovary.\r\n\r\nThe name is derived from the Persian _yásmín_. Linnaeus obtained a\r\nfancied etymology from [Greek: ia], violets, and [Greek: osmê], smell,\r\nbut the odour of its flowers bears no resemblance to that of the violet.\r\nThe common white jasmine, _Jasminum officinale_, one of the best known\r\nand most highly esteemed of British hardy ligneous climbers, is a native\r\nof northern India and Persia, introduced about the middle of the 16th\r\ncentury. In the centre and south of Europe it is thoroughly\r\nacclimatized. Although it grows to the height of 12 and sometimes 20\r\nft., its stem is feeble and requires support; its leaves are opposite,\r\npinnate and dark green, the leaflets are in three pairs, with an odd\r\none, and are pointed, the terminal one larger and with a tapering point.\r\nThe fragrant white flowers bloom from June to October; and, as they are\r\nfound chiefly on the young shoots, the plant should only be pruned in\r\nthe autumn. Varieties with golden and silver-edged leaves and one with\r\ndouble flowers are known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Jasminum grandiflorum_; flower, natural size.]\r\n\r\n  The zambak or Arabian jasmine, _J. Sambac_, is an evergreen\r\n  white-flowered climber, 6 or 8 ft. high, introduced into Britain in\r\n  the latter part of the 17th century. Two varieties introduced somewhat\r\n  later are respectively 3-leaved and double-flowered, and these, as\r\n  well as that with normal flowers, bloom throughout the greater part of\r\n  the year. On account of their exquisite fragrance the flowers are\r\n  highly esteemed in the East, and are frequently referred to by the\r\n  Persian and Arabian poets. An oil obtained by boiling the leaves is\r\n  used to anoint the head for complaints of the eye, and an oil obtained\r\n  from the roots is used medicinally to arrest the secretion of milk.\r\n  The flowers of one of the double varieties are held sacred to Vishnu,\r\n  and used as votive offerings in Hindu religious ceremonies. The\r\n  Spanish, or Catalonian jasmine, _J. grandiflorum_, a native of the\r\n  north-west Himalaya, and cultivated both in the old and new world, is\r\n  very like _J. officinale_, but differs in the size of the leaflets;\r\n  the branches are shorter and stouter, and the flowers very much\r\n  larger, and reddish underneath. By grafting it on two-year-old plants\r\n  of _J. officinale_, an erect bush about 3 ft. high is obtained,\r\n  requiring no supports. In this way it is very extensively cultivated\r\n  at Cannes and Grasse, in the south of France; the plants are set in\r\n  rows, fully exposed to the sun; they come into full bearing the second\r\n  year after grafting; the blossoms, which are very large and intensely\r\n  fragrant, are produced from July till the end of October, but those of\r\n  August and September are the most odoriferous.\r\n\r\n  The aroma is extracted by the process known as _enfleurage_, i.e.\r\n  absorption by a fatty body, such as purified lard or olive oil. Square\r\n  glass trays framed with wood about 3 in. deep are spread over with\r\n  grease about half an inch thick, in which ridges are made to\r\n  facilitate absorption, and sprinkled with freshly gathered flowers,\r\n  which are renewed every morning during the whole time the plant\r\n  remains in blossom; the trays are piled up in stacks to prevent the\r\n  evaporation of the aroma; and finally the pomade is scraped off the\r\n  glass, melted at as low a temperature as possible, and strained. When\r\n  oil is employed as the absorbent, coarse cotton cloths previously\r\n  saturated with the finest olive oil are laid on wire-gauze frames, and\r\n  repeatedly covered in the same manner with fresh flowers; they are\r\n  then squeezed under a press, yielding what is termed _huile antique au\r\n  jasmin_. Three pounds of flowers will perfume 1 lb. of grease--this is\r\n  exhausted by maceration in 1 pt. of rectified spirit to form the\r\n  \"extract.\" An essential oil is distilled from jasmine in Tunis and\r\n  Algeria, but its high price prevents its being used to any extent. The\r\n  East Indian oil of jasmine is a compound largely contaminated with\r\n  sandalwood-oil.\r\n\r\n  The distinguishing characters of _J. odoratissimum_, a native of the\r\n  Canary Islands and Madeira, consist principally in the alternate,\r\n  obtuse, ternate and pinnate leaves, the 3-flowered terminal peduncles\r\n  and the 5-cleft yellow corolla with obtuse segments. The flowers have\r\n  the advantage of retaining when dry their natural perfume, which is\r\n  suggestive of a mixture of jasmine, jonquil and orange-blossom. In\r\n  China _J. paniculatum_ is cultivated as an erect shrub, known as\r\n  _sieu-hing-hwa_; it is valued for its flowers, which are used with\r\n  those of _J. Sambac_, in the proportion of 10 lb. of the former to 30\r\n  lb. of the latter, for scenting tea--40 lb. of the mixture being\r\n  required for 100 lb. of tea. _J. angustifolium_ is a beautiful\r\n  evergreen climber 10 to 12 ft. high, found in the Coromandel forests,\r\n  and introduced into Britain during the present century. Its leaves are\r\n  of a bright shining green; its large terminal flowers are white with a\r\n  faint tinge of red, fragrant and blooming throughout the year.\r\n\r\n  In Cochin China a decoction of the leaves and branches of _J.\r\n  nervosum_ is taken as a blood-purifier; and the bitter leaves of _J.\r\n  floribundum_ (called in Abyssinia _habbez-zelim_) mixed with kousso is\r\n  considered a powerful anthelmintic, especially for tapeworm; the\r\n  leaves and branches are added to some fermented liquors to increase\r\n  their intoxicating quality. In Catalonia and in Turkey the wood of the\r\n  jasmine is made into long, slender pipe-stems, highly prized by the\r\n  Moors and Turks. Syrup of jasmine is made by placing in a jar\r\n  alternate layers of the flowers and sugar, covering the whole with wet\r\n  cloths and standing it in a cool place; the perfume is absorbed by the\r\n  sugar, which is converted into a very palatable syrup. The important\r\n  medicinal plant known in America as the \"Carolina jasmine\" is not a\r\n  true jasmine (see GELSEMIUM).\r\n\r\n  Other hardy species commonly cultivated in gardens are the low or\r\n  Italian yellow-flowered jasmine, _J. humile_, an East Indian species\r\n  introduced and now found wild in the south of Europe, an erect shrub 3\r\n  or 4 ft. high, with angular branches, alternate and mostly ternate\r\n  leaves, blossoming from June to September; the common yellow jasmine,\r\n  _J. fruticans_, a native of southern Europe and the Mediterranean\r\n  region, a hardy evergreen shrub, 10 to 12 ft. high, with weak, slender\r\n  stems requiring support, and bearing yellow, odourless flowers from\r\n  spring to autumn; and _J. nudiflorum_ (China), which bears its bright\r\n  yellow flowers in winter before the leaves appear. It thrives in\r\n  almost any situation and grows rapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJASON ([Greek: Iasôn]), in Greek legend, son of Aeson, king of Iolcus in\r\nThessaly. He was the leader of the Argonautic expedition (see\r\nARGONAUTS). After he returned from it he lived at Corinth with his wife\r\nMedea (q.v.) for many years. At last he put away Medea, in order to\r\nmarry Glauce (or Creusa), daughter of the Corinthian king Creon. To\r\navenge herself, Medea presented the new bride with a robe and\r\nhead-dress, by whose magic properties the wearer was burnt to death, and\r\nslew her children by Jason with her own hand. A later story represents\r\nJason as reconciled to Medea (Justin, xlii. 2). His death was said to\r\nhave been due to suicide through grief, caused by Medea's vengeance\r\n(Diod. Sic. iv. 55); or he was crushed by the fall of the poop of the\r\nship \"Argo,\" under which, on the advice of Medea, he had laid himself\r\ndown to sleep (argument of Euripides' _Medea_). The name (more correctly\r\nIason) means \"healer,\" and Jason is possibly a local hero of Iolcus to\r\nwhom healing powers were attributed. The ancients regarded him as the\r\noldest navigator, and the patron of navigation. By the moderns he has\r\nbeen variously explained as a solar deity; a god of summer; a god of\r\nstorm; a god of rain, who carries off the rain-giving cloud (the golden\r\nfleece) to refresh the earth after a long period of drought. Some regard\r\nthe legend as a chthonian myth, Aea (Colchis) being the under-world in\r\nthe Aeolic religious system from which Jason liberates himself and his\r\nbetrothed; others, in view of certain resemblances between the story of\r\nJason and that of Cadmus (the ploughing of the field, the sowing of the\r\ndragon's teeth, the fight with the Sparti, who are finally set fighting\r\nwith one another by a stone hurled into their midst), associate both\r\nwith Demeter the corn-goddess, and refer certain episodes to practices\r\nin use at country festivals, e.g. the stone throwing, which, like the\r\n[Greek: ballêtys] at the Eleusinia and the [Greek: lithobolia] at\r\nTroezen (Pausanias ii. 30, 4 with Frazer's note) was probably intended\r\nto secure a good harvest by driving away the evil spirits of\r\nunfruitfulness.\r\n\r\n  See articles by C. Seeliger in Roscher's _Lexikon der Mythologie_ and\r\n  by F. Durrbach in Daremberg and Saglio's _Dictionnaire des\r\n  antiquités_; H. D. Müller, _Mythologie der griechischen Stämme_\r\n  (1861), ii. 328, who explains the name Jason as \"wanderer\"; W.\r\n  Mannhardt, _Mythologische Forschungen_ (1884), pp. 75, 130; O.\r\n  Crusius, _Beiträge zur griechischen Mythologie una\r\n  Religionsgeschichte_ (Leipzig, 1886).\r\n\r\n_Later Versions of the Legend._--_Les fais et prouesses du noble et\r\nvaillant chevalier Jason_ was composed in the middle of the 15th century\r\nby Raoul Lefèvre on the basis of Benoît's _Roman de Troie_, and\r\npresented to Philip of Burgundy, founder of the order of the Golden\r\nFleece. The manners and sentiments of the 15th century are made to\r\nharmonize with the classical legends after the fashion of the Italian\r\npre-Raphaelite painters, who equipped Jewish warriors with knightly\r\nlance and armour. The story is well told; the digressions are few; and\r\nthere are many touches of domestic life and natural sympathy. The first\r\nedition is believed to have been printed at Bruges in 1474.\r\n\r\n  Caxton translated the book under the title of _A Boke of the hoole Lyf\r\n  of Jason_, at the command of the duchess of Burgundy. A Flemish\r\n  translation appeared at Haarlem in 1495. The Benedictine Bernard de\r\n  Montfaucon (1655-1741) refers to a MS. by Guido delle Colonne,\r\n  _Historia Medeae et Jasonis_ (unpublished).\r\n\r\n  The _Histoire de la Thoison d'Or_ (Paris, 1516) by Guillaume Fillastre\r\n  (1400-1473), written about 1440-1450, is an historical compilation\r\n  dealing with the exploits of the _très chrétiennes maisons_ of France,\r\n  Burgundy and Flanders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJASON OF CYRENE, a Hellenistic Jew, who lived about 100 B.C. and wrote a\r\nhistory of the times of the Maccabees down to the victory over Nicanor\r\n(175-161 B.C.). This work is said to have been in five books and formed\r\nthe basis of the present 2 Macc. (see ch. ii. 19-32).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJASPER, an opaque compact variety of quartz, variously coloured and\r\noften containing argillaceous matter. The colours are usually red,\r\nbrown, yellow or green, and are due to admixture with compounds of iron,\r\neither oxides or silicates. Although the term jasper is now restricted\r\nto opaque quartz it is certain that the ancient _jaspis_ or [Greek:\r\niaspis] was a stone of considerable translucency. The jasper of\r\nantiquity was in many cases distinctly green, for it is often compared\r\nwith the emerald and other green objects. Jasper is referred to in the\r\n_Niebelungenlied_ as being clear and green. Probably the jasper of the\r\nancients included stones which would now be classed as chalcedony, and\r\nthe emerald-like jasper may have been akin to our chrysoprase. The\r\nHebrew word _yashefeh_ may have designated a green jasper (cf. Assyrian\r\n_yashpu_). Professor Flinders Petrie has suggested that the _odem_, the\r\nfirst stone on the High Priest's breastplate, translated \"sard,\" was a\r\nred jasper, whilst _tarshish_, the tenth stone, may have been a yellow\r\njasper (Hastings's _Dict. Bible_, 1902).\r\n\r\n  Many varieties of jasper are recognized. Riband jasper is a form in\r\n  which the colours are disposed in bands, as in the well-known\r\n  ornamental stone from Siberia, which shows a regular alternation of\r\n  dark red and green stripes. Egyptian jasper is a brown jasper,\r\n  occurring as nodules in the Lybian desert and in the Nile valley, and\r\n  characterized by a zonal arrangement of light and dark shades of\r\n  colour. Agate-jasper is a variety intermediate between true jasper and\r\n  chalcedony. Basanite, lydite, or Lydian stone, is a velvet-black\r\n  flinty jasper, used as a touchstone for testing the purity of precious\r\n  metals by their streak. Porcelain jasper is a clay indurated by\r\n  natural calcination.     (F. W. R.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJASSY (_Iasii_), also written JASII, JASCHI and YASSY, the capital of\r\nthe department of Jassy, Rumania; situated on the left bank of the river\r\nBahlui, an affluent of the Jijia, about 10 m. W. of the Pruth and the\r\nRussian frontier. Pop. (1900), 78,067. Jassy communicates by rail with\r\nGalatz on the Danube, Kishinev in Bessarabia, and Czernowitz in\r\nBukowina. The surrounding country is one of uplands and woods, among\r\nwhich rise the monasteries of Cetatuia, Frumoasa, and Galata with its\r\nmineral springs, the water-cure establishment of Rapide and the great\r\nseminary of Socola. Jassy itself stands pleasantly amid vineyards and\r\ngardens, partly on two hills, partly in the hollow between. Its\r\nprimitive houses of timber and plaster were mostly swept away after\r\n1860, when brick or stone came into general use, and good streets were\r\ncut among the network of narrow, insanitary lanes. Jassy is the seat of\r\nthe metropolitan of Moldavia, and of a Roman Catholic archbishop.\r\nSynagogues and churches abound. The two oldest churches date from the\r\nreign of Stephen the Great (1458-1504); perhaps the finest, however, are\r\nthe 17th-century metropolitan, St Spiridion and Trei Erarchi, the last a\r\ncurious example of Byzantine art, erected in 1639 or 1640 by Basil the\r\nWolf, and adorned with countless gilded carvings on its outer walls and\r\ntwin towers. The St Spiridion Foundation (due to the liberality of\r\nPrince Gregory Ghika in 1727, and available for the sick of all\r\ncountries and creeds) has an annual income of over £80,000, and\r\nmaintains hospitals and churches in several towns of Moldavia, besides\r\nthe baths at Slanic in Walachia. The main hospital in Jassy is a large\r\nbuilding, and possesses a maternity institution, a midwifery school, a\r\nchemical institute, an inoculating establishment, &c. A society of\r\nphysicians and naturalists has existed in Jassy since the early part of\r\nthe 19th century, and a number of periodicals are published. Besides the\r\nuniversity, founded by Prince Cuza in 1864, with faculties of\r\nliterature, philosophy, law, science and medicine, there are a military\r\nacademy and schools of art, music and commerce; a museum, a fine hall\r\nand a theatre; the state library, where the chief records of Rumanian\r\nhistory are preserved; an appeal court, a chamber of commerce and\r\nseveral banks. The city is the headquarters of the 4th army corps. It\r\nhas an active trade in petroleum, salt, metals, timber, cereals, fruit,\r\nwine, spirits, preserved meat, textiles, clothing, leather, cardboard\r\nand cigarette paper.\r\n\r\nThe inscription by which the existence of a _Jassiorum municipium_ in\r\nthe time of the Roman Empire is sought to be proved, lies open to grave\r\nsuspicion; but the city is mentioned as early as the 14th century, and\r\nprobably does derive its name from the Jassians, or Jazygians, who\r\naccompanied the Cumanian invaders. It was often visited by the Moldavian\r\ncourt. About 1564, Prince Alexander Lapusneanu, after whom one of the\r\nchief streets is named, chose Jassy for the Moldavian capital, instead\r\nof Suceava (now Suczawa, in Bukowina). It was already famous as a centre\r\nof culture. Between 1561 and 1563 an excellent school and a Lutheran\r\nchurch were founded by the Greek adventurer, Jacob Basilicus (see\r\nRUMANIA: _History_). In 1643 the first printed book published in\r\nMoldavia was issued from a press established by Basil the Wolf. He also\r\nfounded a school, the first in which the mother-tongue took the place of\r\nGreek. Jassy was burned by the Tatars in 1513, by the Turks in 1538, and\r\nby the Russians in 1686. By the Peace of Jassy the second Russo-Turkish\r\nWar was brought to a close in 1792. A Greek insurrection under Ypsilanti\r\nin 1821 led to the storming of the city by the Turks in 1822. In 1844\r\nthere was a severe conflagration. For the loss caused to the city in\r\n1861 by the removal of the seat of government to Bucharest the\r\nconstituent assembly voted £148,150, to be paid in ten annual\r\ninstalments, but no payment was ever made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJATAKA, the technical name, in Buddhist literature, for a story of one\r\nor other of the previous births of the Buddha. The word is also used for\r\nthe name of a collection of 547 of such stories included, by a most\r\nfortunate conjuncture of circumstances, in the Buddhist canon. This is\r\nthe most ancient and the most complete collection of folk-lore now\r\nextant in any literature in the world. As it was made at latest in the\r\n3rd century B.C., it can be trusted not to give any of that modern or\r\nEuropean colouring which renders suspect much of the folk-lore collected\r\nby modern travellers.\r\n\r\nAlready in the oldest documents, drawn up by the disciples soon after\r\nthe Buddha's death, he is identified with certain ancient sages of\r\nrenown. That a religious teacher should claim to be successor of the\r\nprophets of old is not uncommon in the history of religions. But the\r\ncurrent belief in metempsychosis led, or enabled, the early Buddhists to\r\nmake a much wider claim. It was not very long before they gradually\r\nidentified their master with the hero of each of the popular fables and\r\nstories of which they were so fond. The process must have been complete\r\nby the middle of the 3rd century B.C.; for we find at that date\r\nillustrations of the Jatakas in the bas-reliefs on the railing round the\r\nBharahat tope with the titles of the Jataka stories inscribed above them\r\nin the characters of that period.[1] The hero of each story is made into\r\na Bodhisatta; that is, a being who is destined, after a number of\r\nsubsequent births, to become a Buddha. This rapid development of the\r\nBodhisatta theory is the distinguishing feature in the early history of\r\nBuddhism, and was both cause and effect of the simultaneous growth of\r\nthe Jataka book. In adopting the folk-lore and fables already current in\r\nIndia, the Buddhists did not change them very much. The stories as\r\npreserved to us, are for the most part Indian rather than Buddhist. The\r\nethics they inculcate or suggest are milk for babes; very simple in\r\ncharacter and referring almost exclusively to matters common to all\r\nschools of thought in India, and indeed elsewhere. Kindness, purity,\r\nhonesty, generosity, worldly wisdom, perseverance, are the usual virtues\r\npraised; the higher ethics of the Path are scarcely mentioned. These\r\nstories, popular with all, were especially appreciated by that school of\r\nBuddhists that laid stress on the Bodhisatta theory--a school that\r\nobtained its chief support, and probably had its origin, in the extreme\r\nnorth-west of India and in the highlands of Asia. That school adopted,\r\nfrom the early centuries of our era, the use of Sanskrit, instead of\r\nPali, as the means of literary expression. It is almost impossible,\r\ntherefore, that they would have carried the canonical Pali book,\r\nvoluminous as it is, into Central Asia. Shorter collections of the\r\noriginal stories, written in Sanskrit, were in vogue among them. One\r\nsuch collection, the Jataka-mala, by Arya Sura (6th century), is still\r\nextant. Of the existence of another collection, though the Sanskrit\r\noriginal has not yet been found, we have curious evidence. In the 6th\r\ncentury a book of Sanskrit fables was translated into Pahlavi, that is,\r\nold Persian (see Bidpai). In succeeding centuries this work was\r\nretranslated into Arabic and Hebrew, thence into Latin and Greek and all\r\nthe modern languages of Europe. The book bears a close resemblance to\r\nthe earlier chapters of a late Sanskrit fable book called, from its\r\nhaving five chapters, the _Pancha tantra_, or Pentateuch.\r\n\r\nThe introduction to the old Jataka book gives the life of the historical\r\nBuddha. That introduction must also have reached Persia by the same\r\nroute. For in the 8th century St John of Damascus put the story into\r\nGreek under the title of _Barlaam and Josaphat_. This story became very\r\npopular in the West. It was translated into Latin, into seven European\r\nlanguages, and even into Icelandic and the dialect of the Philippine\r\nIslands. Its hero, that is the Buddha, was canonized as a Christian\r\nsaint; and the 27th of November was officially fixed as the date for his\r\nadoration as such.\r\n\r\n  The book popularly known in Europe as _Aesop's Fables_ was not written\r\n  by Aesop. It was put together in the 14th century at Constantinople by\r\n  a monk named Planudes, and he drew largely for his stories upon those\r\n  in the Jataka book that had reached Europe along various channels. The\r\n  fables of Babrius and Phaedrus, written respectively in the 1st\r\n  century before, and in the 1st century after, the Christian era, also\r\n  contain Jataka stories known in India in the 4th century B.C. A great\r\n  deal has been written on this curious question of the migration of\r\n  fables. But we are still very far from being able to trace the\r\n  complete history of each story in the Jataka book, or in any one of\r\n  the later collections. For India itself the record is most incomplete.\r\n  We have the original Jataka book in text and translation. The history\r\n  of the text of the Pancha tantra, about a thousand years later, has\r\n  been fairly well traced out. But for the intervening centuries\r\n  scarcely anything has been done. There are illustrations, in the\r\n  bas-reliefs of the 3rd century B.C., of Jatakas not contained in the\r\n  Jataka book. Another collection, the _Cariyâ pitaka_, of about the\r\n  same date, has been edited, but not translated. Other collections both\r\n  in Pali and Sanskrit are known to be extant in MS; and a large number\r\n  of Jataka stories, not included in any formal collection, are\r\n  mentioned, or told in full, in other works.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--V.

(1901), 5404.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJÁTIVA (formerly written XATIVA), or SAN FELIPE DE JÁTIVA, a town of\r\neastern Spain, in the province of Valencia, on the right bank of the\r\nriver Albaida, a tributary of the Júcar, and at the junction of the\r\nValencia-Murcia and Valencia-Albacete railways. Pop. (1900), 12,600.\r\nJátiva is built on the margin of a fertile and beautiful plain, and on\r\nthe southern slopes of the Monte Bernisa, a hill with two peaks, each\r\nsurmounted by a castle. With its numerous fountains, and spacious\r\navenues shaded with elms or cypresses, the town has a clean and\r\nattractive appearance. Its collegiate church, dating from 1414, but\r\nrebuilt about a century later in the Renaissance style, was formerly a\r\ncathedral, and is the chief among many churches and convents. The\r\ntown-hall and a church on the castle hill are partly constructed of\r\ninscribed Roman masonry, and several houses date from the Moorish\r\noccupation. There is a brisk local trade in grain, fruit, wine, oil and\r\nrice.\r\n\r\nJátiva was the Roman Saetabis, afterwards Valeria Augusta, of\r\nCarthaginian or Iberian origin. Pliny (23-79) and Martial (c. 40-102)\r\nmention the excellence of its linen cloth. Under the Visigoths (c.\r\n483-711) it became an episcopal see; but early in the 8th century it was\r\ncaptured by the Moors, under whom it attained great prosperity, and\r\nreceived its present name. It was reconquered by James I. of Aragon\r\n(1213-1276). During the 15th and 16th centuries, Játiva was the home of\r\nmany members of the princely house of Borgia or Borja, who migrated\r\nhither from the town of Borja in the province of Saragossa. Alphonso\r\nBorgia, afterwards Pope Calixtus III., and Rodrigo Borgia, afterwards\r\nPope Alexander VI., were natives of Játiva, born respectively in 1378\r\nand 1431. The painter Jusepe Ribera was also born here in 1588. Owing to\r\nits gallant defence against the troops of the Archduke Charles in the\r\nwar of the Spanish succession, Játiva received the additional name of\r\nSan Felipe from Philip V. (1700-1746).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJATS, or JUTS, a people of north-western India, who numbered altogether\r\nmore than 7 millions in 1901. They form a considerable proportion of the\r\npopulation in the Punjab, Rajputana and the adjoining districts of the\r\nUnited Provinces, and are also widely scattered through Sind and\r\nBaluchistan. Some writers have identified the Juts with the ancient\r\nGetae, and there is strong reason to believe them a degraded tribe of\r\nRajputs, whose Scythic origin has also been maintained. Hindu legends\r\npoint to a prehistoric occupation of the Indus valley by this people,\r\nand at the time of the Mahommedan conquest of Sind (712) they, with a\r\ncognate tribe called Meds, constituted the bulk of the population. They\r\nenlisted under the banner of Mahommed bin Kasim, but at a later date\r\noffered a vigorous resistance to the Arab invaders. In 836 they were\r\noverthrown by Amran, who imposed on them a tribute of dogs, and used\r\ntheir arms to vanquish the Meds. In 1025, however, they had gathered\r\naudacity, not only to invade Mansura, and compel the abjuration of the\r\nMussulman amir, but to attack the victorious army of Mahmud, laden with\r\nthe spoil of Somnath. Chastisement duly ensued: a formidable flotilla,\r\ncollected at Multan, shattered in thousands the comparatively\r\ndefenceless Jat boats on the Indus, and annihilated their national\r\npretensions. It is not until the decay of the Mogul Empire that the Jats\r\nagain appear in history. One branch of them, settled south of Agra,\r\nmainly by bold plundering raids founded two dynasties which still exist\r\nat Bharatpur (q.v.) and Dholpur (q.v.). Another branch, settled\r\nnorth-west of Delhi, who adopted the Sikh religion, ultimately made\r\nthemselves dominant throughout the Punjab (q.v.) under Ranjit Singh, and\r\nare now represented in their original home by the Phulkian houses of\r\nPatiala (q.v.), Jind (q.v.) and Nabha (q.v.). It is from this latter\r\nbranch that the Sikh regiments of the Indian army are recruited. The\r\nJats are mainly agriculturists and cattle breeders. In their settlements\r\non the Ganges and Jumna, extending as far east as Bareilly, they are\r\ndivided into two great clans, the Dhe and the Hele; while in the Punjab\r\nthere are said to be one hundred different sections. Their religion\r\nvaries with locality. In the Punjab they have largely embraced Sikh\r\ntenets, while in Sind and Baluchistan they are Mahommedans. In\r\nappearance they are not ill-favoured though extremely dark; they have\r\ngood teeth, and large beards, sometimes stained with indigo. Their\r\ninferiority of social position, however, to some extent betrays itself\r\nin their aspect, and tends to be perpetuated by their intellectual\r\napathy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAUBERT, PIERRE AMÉDÉE ÉMILIEN PROBE (1779-1847), French Orientalist,\r\nwas born at Aix in Provence on the 3rd of June 1779. He was one of the\r\nmost distinguished pupils of Silvestre de Sacy, whose funeral _Discours_\r\nhe pronounced in 1838. Jaubert acted as interpreter to Napoleon in Egypt\r\nin 1798-1799, and on his return to Paris held various posts under\r\ngovernment. In 1802 he accompanied Sebastiani on his Eastern mission;\r\nand in 1804 he was at Constantinople. Next year he was despatched to\r\nPersia to arrange an alliance with the shah; but on the way he was\r\nseized and imprisoned in a dry cistern for four months by the pasha of\r\nBayazid. The pasha's death freed Jaubert, who successfully accomplished\r\nhis mission, and rejoined Napoleon at Warsaw in 1807. On the eve of\r\nNapoleon's downfall he was appointed chargé d'affaires at\r\nConstantinople. The restoration ended his diplomatic career, but in 1818\r\nhe undertook a journey with government aid to Tibet, whence he succeeded\r\nin introducing into France 400 Kashmir goats. The rest of his life\r\nJaubert spent in study, in writing and in teaching. He became professor\r\nof Persian in the collège de France, and director of the école des\r\nlangues orientales, and in 1830 was elected member of the Académie des\r\nInscriptions. In 1841 he was made a peer of France and councillor of\r\nstate. He died in Paris on the 28th of January, 1847.\r\n\r\n  Besides articles in the _Journal asiatique_, he published _Voyage en\r\n  Arménie et en Perse_ (1821; the edition of 1860 has a notice of\r\n  Jaubert, by M. Sédillot) and _Éléments de la grammaire turque_\r\n  (1823-1834). See notices in the _Journal asiatique_, Jan. 1847, and\r\n  the _Journal des débats_, Jan. 30, 1847.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAUCOURT, ARNAIL FRANÇOIS, MARQUIS DE (1757-1852), French politician,\r\nwas born on the 14th of November 1757 at Tournon (Seine-et-Marne) of a\r\nProtestant family, protected by the prince de Condé, whose regiment he\r\nentered. He adopted revolutionary ideas and became colonel of his\r\nregiment. In the Assembly, to which he was returned in 1791 by the\r\ndepartment of Seine-et-Marne, he voted generally with the minority, and\r\nhis views being obviously too moderate for his colleagues he resigned in\r\n1792 and was soon after arrested on suspicion of being a reactionary.\r\nMme de Staël procured his release from P. L. Manuel just before the\r\nSeptember massacres. He accompanied Talleyrand on his mission to\r\nEngland, returning to France after the execution of Louis XVI. He lived\r\nin retirement until the establishment of the Consulate, when he entered\r\nthe tribunate, of which he was for some time president. In 1803 he\r\nentered the senate, and next year became attached to the household of\r\nJoseph Bonaparte. Presently his imperialist views cooled, and at the\r\nRestoration he became minister of state and a peer of France. At the\r\nsecond Restoration he was for a brief period minister of marine, but\r\nheld no further office. He devoted himself to the support of the\r\nProtestant interest in France. A member of the upper house throughout\r\nthe reign of Louis Philippe, he was driven into private life by the\r\nestablishment of the Second Republic, but lived to see the _Coup d'état_\r\nand to rally to the government of Louis Napoleon, dying in Paris on the\r\n5th of February 1852.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAUER, a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of Silesia, 13 m. by\r\nrail S. of Leignitz, on the Wüthende Neisse. Pop. (1900), 13,024. St\r\nMartin's (Roman Catholic) church dates from 1267-1290, and the\r\nEvangelical church from 1655. A new town-hall was erected in 1895-1898.\r\nJauer manufactures leather, carpets, cigars, carriages and gloves, and\r\nis specially famous for its sausages. The town was first mentioned in\r\n1242, and was formerly the capital of a principality embracing about\r\n1200 sq. m., now occupied by the circles of Jauer, Bunzlau, Löweberg,\r\nHirschberg and Schönau. From 1392 to 1741 it belonged to the kings of\r\nBohemia, being taken from Maria Theresa by Frederick the Great. Jauer\r\nwas formerly the prosperous seat of the Silesian linen trade, but the\r\ntroubles of the Thirty Years' War, in the course of which it was burned\r\ndown three times, permanently injured this.\r\n\r\n  See Schönaich, _Die alte Fürstentumshauptstadt Jauer_ (Jauer, 1903).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAUHARI (ABU NASR ISMA^EIL IBN HAMMAD UL-JAUHARI) (d. 1002 or 1010),\r\nArabian lexicographer, was born at Farab on the borders of Turkestan. He\r\nstudied language in Farab and Bagdad, and later among the Arabs of the\r\ndesert. He then settled in Damghan and afterwards at Nishapur, where he\r\ndied by a fall from the roof of a house. His great work is the _Kitab\r\nus-Sahah fil-Lugha_, an Arabic dictionary, in which the words are\r\narranged alphabetically according to the last letter of the root. He\r\nhimself had only partially finished the last recension, but the work was\r\ncompleted by his pupil, Abu Ishaq Ibrahim ibn Salih ul-Warraq.\r\n\r\n  An edition was begun by E. Scheidius with a Latin translation, but one\r\n  part only appeared at Harderwijk (1776). The whole has been published\r\n  at Tebriz (1854) and at Cairo (1865), and many abridgments and Persian\r\n  translations have appeared; cf. C. Brockelmann, _Geschichte der\r\n  arabischen Literatur_ (Weimar, 1898), i. 128 seq.     (G. W. T.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAUNDICE (Fr. _jaunisse_, from _jaune_, yellow), or ICTERUS (from its\r\nresemblance to the colour of the golden oriole, of which Pliny relates\r\nthat if a jaundiced person looks upon it he recovers but the bird dies),\r\na term in medicine applied to a yellow coloration of the skin and other\r\nparts of the body, depending in most instances on some derangement\r\naffecting the liver. This yellow colour is due to the presence in the\r\nblood of bile or of some of the elements of that secretion. Jaundice,\r\nhowever, must be regarded more as a symptom of some morbid condition\r\npreviously existing than as a disease _per se_.\r\n\r\nCases with jaundice may be divided into three groups.\r\n\r\n1. _Obstructive Jaundice._--Any obstruction of the passage of bile from\r\nthe liver into the intestinal canal is sooner or later followed by the\r\nappearance of jaundice, which in such circumstances is due to the\r\nabsorption of bile into the blood. The obstruction is due to one of the\r\nfollowing causes: (1) Obstruction by foreign bodies within the bile\r\nduct, e.g. gallstones or parasites; (2) inflammation of the duodenum or\r\nthe lining membrane of the duct; (3) stricture or obliteration of the\r\nduct; (4) a tumour growing from the duct; (5) pressure on the duct from\r\nwithout, from the liver or other organ, or tumours arising from them.\r\nObstructions from these causes may be partial or complete, and the\r\ndegree of jaundice will vary accordingly, but it is to be noted that\r\nextensive organic disease of the liver may exist without the evidence of\r\nobstructive jaundice.\r\n\r\nThe effect upon the liver of impediments to the outflow of bile such as\r\nthose above indicated is in the first place an increase in its size, the\r\nwhole biliary passages and the liver cells being distended with retained\r\nbile. This enlargement, however, speedily subsides when the obstruction\r\nis removed, but should it persist the liver ultimately shrinks and\r\nundergoes atrophy in its whole texture. The bile thus retained is\r\nabsorbed into the system, and shows itself by the yellow staining seen\r\nto a greater or less extent in all the tissues and many of the fluids of\r\nthe body. The kidneys, which in such circumstances act in some measure\r\nvicariously to the liver and excrete a portion of the retained bile,\r\nare apt to become affected in their structure by the long continuance of\r\njaundice.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of obstructive jaundice necessarily vary according to the\r\nnature of the exciting cause, but there generally exists evidence of\r\nsome morbid condition before the yellow coloration appears. Thus, if the\r\nobstruction be due to an impacted gallstone in the common or hepatic\r\nduct, there will probably be the symptoms of intense suffering\r\ncharacterizing hepatic colic (see COLIC). In the cases most frequently\r\nseen--those, namely, arising from simple catarrh of the bile ducts due\r\nto gastro-duodenal irritation spreading through the common duct--the\r\nfirst sign to attract attention is the yellow appearance of the white of\r\nthe eye, which is speedily followed by a similar colour on the skin over\r\nthe body generally. The yellow tinge is most distinct where the skin is\r\nthin, as on the forehead, breast, elbows, &c. It may be also well seen\r\nin the roof of the mouth, but in the lips and gums the colour is not\r\nobserved till the blood is first pressed from them. The tint varies,\r\nbeing in the milder cases faint, in the more severe a deep saffron\r\nyellow, while in extreme degrees of obstruction it may be of dark brown\r\nor greenish hue. The colour can scarcely, if at all, be observed in\r\nartificial light.\r\n\r\nThe urine exhibits well marked and characteristic changes in jaundice\r\nwhich exist even before any evidence can be detected on the skin or\r\nelsewhere. It is always of dark brown colour resembling porter, but\r\nafter standing in the air it acquires a greenish tint. Its froth is\r\ngreenish-yellow, and it stains with this colour any white substance. It\r\ncontains not only the bile colouring matter but also the bile acids. The\r\nformer is detected by the play of colours yielded on the addition of\r\nnitric acid, the latter by the purple colour, produced by placing a\r\npiece of lump sugar in the urine tested, and adding thereto a few drops\r\nof strong sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the bowels also undergo changes, being characterized\r\nchiefly by their pale clay colour, which is in proportion to the amount\r\nof hepatic obstruction, and to their consequent want of admixture with\r\nbile. For the same reason they contain a large amount of unabsorbed\r\nfatty matter, and have an extremely offensive odour.\r\n\r\nConstitutional symptoms always attend jaundice with obstruction. The\r\npatient becomes languid, drowsy and irritable, and has generally a slow\r\npulse. The appetite is usually but not always diminished, a bitter taste\r\nin the mouth is complained of, while flatulent eructations arise from\r\nthe stomach. Intolerable itching of the skin is a common accompaniment\r\nof jaundice, and cutaneous eruptions or boils are occasionally seen.\r\nYellow vision appears to be present in some very rare cases. Should the\r\njaundice depend on advancing organic disease of the liver, such as\r\ncancer, the tinge becomes gradually deeper, and the emaciation and\r\ndebility more marked towards the fatal termination, which in such cases\r\nis seldom long postponed. Apart from this, however, jaundice from\r\nobstruction may exist for many years, as in those instances where the\r\nwalls of the bile ducts are thickened from chronic catarrh, but where\r\nthey are only partially occluded. In the common cases of acute catarrhal\r\njaundice recovery usually takes place in two or three weeks.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of this form of jaundice bears reference to the cause\r\ngiving rise to the obstruction. In the ordinary cases of simple\r\ncatarrhal jaundice, or that following the passing of gallstones, a light\r\nnutritious diet (milk, soups, &c., avoiding saccharine and farinaceous\r\nsubstances and alcoholic stimulants), along with counter-irritation\r\napplied over the right side and the use of laxatives and cholagogues,\r\nwill be found to be advantageous. Diaphoretics and diuretics to promote\r\nthe action of the skin and kidneys are useful in jaundice. In the more\r\nchronic forms, besides the remedies above named, the waters of Carlsbad\r\nare of special efficacy. In cases other than acute catarrhal, operative\r\ninterference is often called for, to remove the gallstones, tumour, &c.,\r\ncausing the obstruction.\r\n\r\n2. _Toxaemic Jaundice_ is observed to occur as a symptom in certain\r\nfevers, e.g. yellow fever, ague, and in pyaemia also as the effect of\r\ncertain poisons, such as phosphorus, and the venom of snake-bites.\r\nJaundice of this kind is almost always slight, and neither the urine nor\r\nthe discharges from the bowels exhibit changes in appearance to such a\r\ndegree as in the obstructive variety. Grave constitutional symptoms are\r\noften present, but they are less to be ascribed to the jaundice than to\r\nthe disease with which it is associated.\r\n\r\n3. _Hereditary Jaundice._--Under this group there are the jaundice of\r\nnew-born infants, which varies enormously in severity; the cases in\r\nwhich a slight form of jaundice obtains in several members of the same\r\nfamily, without other symptoms, and which may persist for years; and\r\nlastly the group of cases with hypertrophic cirrhosis.\r\n\r\n  The name _malignant jaundice_ is sometimes applied to that very fatal\r\n  form of disease otherwise termed acute yellow atrophy of the liver\r\n  (see ATROPHY).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAUNPUR, a city and district of British India, in the Benares division\r\nof the United Provinces. The city is on the left bank of the river\r\nGumti, 34 m. N.W. from Benares by rail. Pop. (1901), 42,771. Jaunpur is\r\na very ancient city, the former capital of a Mahommedan kingdom which\r\nonce extended from Budaun and Etawah to Behar. It abounds in splendid\r\narchitectural monuments, most of which belong to the period when the\r\nrulers of Jaunpur were independent of Delhi. The fort of Feroz Shah is\r\nin great part completely ruined, but there remain a fine gateway of the\r\n16th century, a mosque dating from 1376, and the _hammams_ or baths of\r\nIbrahim Shah. Among other buildings may be mentioned the Atala Masjid\r\n(1408) and the ruined Jinjiri Masjid, mosques built by Ibrahim, the\r\nfirst of which has a great cloistered court and a magnificent façade;\r\nthe Dariba mosque constructed by two of Ibrahim's governors; the Lal\r\nDarwaza erected by the queen of Mahmud; the Jama Masjid (1438-1478) or\r\ngreat mosque of Husain, with court and cloisters, standing on a raised\r\nterrace, and in part restored in modern times; and finally the splendid\r\nbridge over the Gumti, erected by Munim Khan, Mogul governor in\r\n1569-1573. During the Mutiny of 1857 Jaunpur formed a centre of\r\ndisaffection. The city has now lost its importance, the only industries\r\nsurviving being the manufacture of perfumes and papier-mâché articles.\r\n\r\nThe DISTRICT OF JAUNPUR has an area of 1551 sq. m. It forms part of the\r\nwide Gangetic plain, and its surface is accordingly composed of a thick\r\nalluvial deposit. The whole country is closely tilled, and no waste\r\nlands break the continuous prospect of cultivated fields. It is divided\r\ninto two unequal parts by the sinuous channel of the Gumti, a tributary\r\nof the Ganges, which flows past the city of Jaunpur. Its total course\r\nwithin the district is about 90 m., and it is nowhere fordable. It is\r\ncrossed by two bridges, one at Jaunpur and the other 2 m. lower down.\r\nThe Gumti is liable to sudden inundations during the rainy season, owing\r\nto the high banks it has piled up at its entrance into the Ganges, which\r\nact as dams to prevent the prompt outflow of its flooded waters. These\r\ninundations extend to its tributary the Sai. Much damage was thus\r\neffected in 1774; but the greatest recorded flood took place in\r\nSeptember 1871, when 4000 houses in the city were swept away, besides\r\n9000 more in villages along its banks. The other rivers are the Sai,\r\nBarna, Pili and Basohi. Lakes are numerous in the north and south; the\r\nlargest has a length of 8 m. Pop. (1901), 1,202,920, showing a decrease\r\nof 5% in the decade. Sugar-refining is the principal industry. The\r\ndistrict is served by the line of the Oudh & Rohilkhand railway from\r\nBenares to Fyzabad, and by branches of this and of the Bengal &\r\nNorth-Western systems.\r\n\r\nIn prehistoric times Jaunpur seems to have formed a portion of the\r\nAjodhya principality, and when it first makes an appearance in authentic\r\nhistory it was subject to the rulers of Benares. With the rest of their\r\ndominions it fell under the yoke of the Mussulman invaders in 1194. From\r\nthat time the district appears to have been ruled by a prince of the\r\nKanauj dynasty, as a tributary of the Mahommedan suzerain. In 1388 Malik\r\nSarwar Khwaja was sent by Mahommed Tughlak to govern the eastern\r\nprovince. He fixed his residence at Jaunpur, made himself independent of\r\nthe Delhi court, and assumed the title of Sultan-us-Shark, or \"eastern\r\nemperor.\" For nearly a century the Sharki dynasty ruled at Jaunpur, and\r\nproved formidable rivals to the sovereigns of Delhi. The last of the\r\ndynasty was Sultan Husain, who passed his life in a fierce and chequered\r\nstruggle for supremacy with Bahlol Lodi, then actual emperor at Delhi.\r\nAt length, in 1478, Bahlol succeeded in defeating his rival in a series\r\nof decisive engagements. He took the city of Jaunpur, but permitted the\r\nconquered Husain to reside there, and to complete the building of his\r\ngreat mosque, the Jama Masjid, which now forms the chief ornament of the\r\ntown. Many other architectural works in the district still bear witness\r\nto its greatness under its independent Mussulman rulers. In 1775 the\r\ndistrict was made over to the British by the Treaty of Lucknow. From\r\nthat time nothing occurred which calls for notice till the Mutiny. On\r\nthe 5th of June 1857, when the news of the Benares revolt reached\r\nJaunpur, the sepoys mutinied. The district continued in a state of\r\ncomplete anarchy till the arrival of the Gurkha force from Azamgarh in\r\nSeptember. In November the surrounding country was lost again, and it\r\nwas not till May 1858 that the last smouldering embers of disaffection\r\nwere stifled by the repulse of the insurgent leader at the hands of the\r\npeople themselves.\r\n\r\n  See A. Führer, _The Shargi Architecture of Jaunpur_ (1889).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAUNTING-CAR, a light two-wheeled carriage for a single horse, in its\r\ncommonest form with seats for four persons placed back to back, with the\r\nfoot-boards projecting over the wheels. It is the typical conveyance for\r\npersons in Ireland (see CAR). The first part of the word is generally\r\ntaken to be identical with the verb \"to jaunt,\" now only used in the\r\nsense of to go on a short pleasure excursion, but in its earliest uses\r\nmeaning to make a horse caracole or prance, hence to jolt or bump up and\r\ndown. It would apparently be a variant of \"jaunce,\" of the same meaning,\r\nwhich is supposed to be taken from O. Fr. _jancer_. Skeat takes the\r\norigin of jaunt and jaunce to be Scandinavian, and connects them with\r\nthe Swedish dialect word _ganta_, to romp; and he finds cognate bases in\r\nsuch words as \"jump,\" \"high jinks.\" The word \"jaunty,\" sprightly,\r\nespecially used of anything done with an easy nonchalant air, is a\r\ncorruption of \"janty,\" due to confusion with \"jaunt.\" \"Janty,\" often\r\nspelt in the 17th and 18th centuries \"janté\" or \"jantee,\" represents the\r\nEnglish pronunciation of Fr. _gentil_, well-bred, neat, spruce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAUREGUI, JUAN (1562-1582), a Biscayan by birth, was in 1582 in the\r\nservice of a Spanish merchant, Gaspar d'Anastro, who was resident at\r\nAntwerp. Tempted by the reward of 80,000 ducats offered by Philip II. of\r\nSpain for the assassination of William the Silent, prince of Orange, but\r\nbeing himself without courage to undertake the task, d'Anastro, with the\r\nhelp of his cashier Venero, persuaded Jauregui to attempt the murder for\r\nthe sum of 2877 crowns. On Sunday the 18th of March 1582, as the prince\r\ncame out of his dining-room Jauregui offered him a petition, and William\r\nhad no sooner taken it into his hand than Jauregui fired a pistol at his\r\nhead. The ball pierced the neck below the right ear and passed out at\r\nthe left jaw-bone; but William ultimately recovered. The assassin was\r\nkilled on the spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAURÉGUIBERRY, JEAN BERNARD (1815-1887), French admiral, was born at\r\nBayonne on the 26th of August 1815. He entered the navy in 1831, was\r\nmade a lieutenant in 1845, commander in 1856, and captain in 1860. After\r\nserving in the Crimea and in China, and being governor of Senegal, he\r\nwas promoted to rear-admiral in 1869. He served on land during the\r\nsecond part of the Franco-German War of 1870-71, in the rank of\r\nauxiliary general of division. He was present at Coulmiers, Villépion\r\nand Loigny-Poupry, in command of a division, and in Chanzy's retreat\r\nupon Le Mans and the battle at that place in command of a corps. He was\r\nthe most distinguished of the many naval officers who did good service\r\nin the military operations. On the 9th of December he had been made\r\nvice-admiral, and in 1871 he commanded the fleet at Toulon; in 1875 he\r\nwas a member of the council of admiralty; and in October 1876 he was\r\nappointed to command the evolutionary squadron in the Mediterranean. In\r\nFebruary 1879 he became minister of the navy in the Waddington cabinet,\r\nand on the 27th of May following was elected a senator for life. He was\r\nagain minister of the navy in the Freycinet cabinet in 1880. A fine\r\nexample of the fighting French seaman of his time, Jauréguiberry died at\r\nParis on the 21st of October 1887.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJÁUREGUI Y AGUILAR, JUAN MARTÍNEZ DE (1583-1641), Spanish poet, was\r\nbaptized at Seville on the 24th of November 1583. In due course he\r\nstudied at Rome, returning to Spain shortly before 1610 with a double\r\nreputation as a painter and a poet. A reference in the preface to the\r\n_Novelas exemplares_ has been taken to mean that he painted the portrait\r\nof Cervantes, who, in the second part of _Don Quixote_, praises the\r\ntranslation of Tasso's _Aminta_ published at Rome in 1607. Jáuregui's\r\n_Rimas_ (1618), a collection of graceful lyrics, is preceded by a\r\ncontroversial preface which attracted much attention on account of its\r\noutspoken declaration against _culteranismo_. Through the influence of\r\nOlivares, he was appointed groom of the chamber to Philip IV., and gave\r\nan elaborate exposition of his artistic doctrines in the _Discurso\r\npoético contra el hablar culto y oscuro_ (1624), a skilful attack on the\r\nnew theories, which procured for its author the order of Calatrava. It\r\nis plain, however, that the shock of controversy had shaken Jáuregui's\r\nconvictions, and his poem _Orfeo_ (1624) is visibly influenced by\r\nGóngora. Jáuregui died at Madrid on the 11th of January 1641, leaving\r\nbehind him a translation of the _Pharsalia_ which was not published till\r\n1684. This rendering reveals Jáuregui as a complete convert to the new\r\nschool, and it has been argued that, exaggerating the affinities between\r\nLucan and Góngora--both of Cordovan descent--he deliberately translated\r\nthe thought of the earlier poet into the vocabulary of the later master.\r\nThis is possible; but it is at least as likely that Jáuregui\r\nunconsciously yielded to the current of popular taste, with no other\r\nintention than that of conciliating the public of his own day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAURÈS, JEAN LÉON (1859-   ), French Socialist leader, was born at\r\nCastres (Tarn) on the 3rd of September 1859. He was educated at the\r\nlycée Louis-le-Grand and the école normale supérieure, and took his\r\ndegree as associate in philosophy in 1881. After teaching philosophy for\r\ntwo years at the lycée of Albi (Tarn), he lectured at the university of\r\nToulouse. He was elected republican deputy for the department of Tarn in\r\n1885. In 1889, after unsuccessfully contesting Castres, he returned to\r\nhis professional duties at Toulouse, where he took an active interest in\r\nmunicipal affairs, and helped to found the medical faculty of the\r\nuniversity. He also prepared two theses for his doctorate in philosophy,\r\n_De primis socialismi germanici lineamentis apud Lutherum, Kant, Fichte\r\net Hegel_ (1891), and _De la réalité du monde sensible_. In 1902 he gave\r\nenergetic support to the miners of Carmaux who went out on strike in\r\nconsequence of the dismissal of a socialist workman, Calvignac; and in\r\nthe next year he was re-elected to the chamber as deputy for Albi.\r\nAlthough he was defeated at the elections of 1898 and was for four years\r\noutside the chamber, his eloquent speeches made him a force in politics\r\nas an intellectual champion of socialism. He edited the _Petite\r\nRépublique_, and was one of the most energetic defenders of Captain\r\nAlfred Dreyfus. He approved of the inclusion of M. Millerand, the\r\nsocialist, in the Waldeck-Rousseau ministry, though this led to a split\r\nwith the more revolutionary section led by M. Guesde. In 1902 he was\r\nagain returned as deputy for Albi, and during the Combes administration\r\nhis influence secured the coherence of the radical-socialist coalition\r\nknown as the _bloc_. In 1904 he founded the socialist paper,\r\n_L'Humanité_. The French socialist groups held a congress at Rouen in\r\nMarch 1905, which resulted in a new consolidation; the new party, headed\r\nby MM. Jaurès and Guesde, ceased to co-operate with the radicals and\r\nradical-socialists, and became known as the unified socialists, pledged\r\nto advance a collectivist programme. At the general elections of 1906 M.\r\nJaurès was again elected for the Tarn. His ability and vigour were now\r\ngenerally recognized; but the strength of the socialist party, and the\r\npractical activity of its leader, still had to reckon with the equally\r\npractical and vigorous liberalism of M. Clemenceau. The latter was able\r\nto appeal to his countrymen (in a notable speech in the spring of 1906)\r\nto rally to a radical programme which had no socialist Utopia in view;\r\nand the appearance in him of a strong and practical radical leader had\r\nthe result of considerably diminishing the effect of the socialist\r\npropaganda. M. Jaurès, in addition to his daily journalistic activity,\r\npublished _Les preuves; affaire Dreyfus_ (1900); _Action socialiste_\r\n(1899); _Études socialistes_ (1902), and, with other collaborators,\r\n_Histoire socialiste_ (1901), &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAVA, one of the larger islands of that portion of the Malay Archipelago\r\nwhich is distinguished as the Sunda Islands. It lies between 105° 12´\r\n40´´ (St Nicholas Point) and 114° 35´ 38´´ E. (Cape Seloko) and between\r\n5° 52´ 34´´ and 8° 46´ 46´´ S. It has a total length of 622 m. from\r\nPepper Bay in the west to Banyuwangi in the east, and an extreme breadth\r\nof 121 m. from Cape Bugel in Japara to the coast of Jokjakarta,\r\nnarrowing towards the middle to about 55 m. Politically and commercially\r\nit is important as the seat of the colonial government of the Dutch East\r\nIndies, all other parts of the Dutch territory being distinguished as\r\nthe Outer Possessions (_Buitenbezittungens_). According to the\r\ntriangulation survey (report published in 1901) the area of Java proper\r\nis 48,504 sq. m.; of Madura, the large adjacent and associated island,\r\n1732; and of the smaller islands administratively included with Java and\r\nMadura 1416, thus making a total of 50,970 sq. m. The more important of\r\nthese islands are the following: Pulau Panaitan or Princes Island\r\n(_Prinseneiland_), 47 sq. m., lies in the Sunda Strait, off the\r\nsouth-western peninsula of the main island, from which it is separated\r\nby the Behouden Passage. The Thousand Islands are situated almost due N.\r\nof Batavia. Of these five were inhabited in 1906 by about 1280 seafarers\r\nfrom all parts and their descendants. The Karimon Java archipelago, to\r\nthe north of Semarang, numbers twenty-seven islands with an area of 16\r\nsq. m. and a population of about 800 (having one considerable village on\r\nthe main island). Bavian[1] (Bawian), 100 m. N. of Surabaya, is a ruined\r\nvolcano with an area of 73 sq. m. and a population of about 44,000.\r\nAbout a third of the men are generally absent as traders or coolies. In\r\nSingapore and Sumatra they are known as Boyans. They are devout\r\nMahommedans and many of them make the pilgrimage to Mecca. The Sapudi\r\nand Kangean archipelagoes are eastward continuations of Madura. The\r\nformer, thirteen in all, with an area of 58 sq. m. and 53,000\r\ninhabitants, export cattle, dried fish and trepang; and many of the male\r\npopulation work as day labourers in Java or as lumbermen in Sumbawa,\r\nFlores, &c. The main island of the Kangians has an area of 19 sq. m.;\r\nthe whole group 23 sq. m. It is best known for its limestone caves and\r\nits buffaloes. Along the south coast the islands are few and\r\nsmall--Klapper or Deli, Trouwers or Tingal, Nusa Kembangan, Sempu and\r\nNusa Barung.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of Java.]\r\n\r\nFrom Sumatra on the W., Java is separated by the Sunda Strait, which at\r\nthe narrowest is only 14 m. broad, but widens elsewhere to about 50 m.\r\nOn the E. the strait of Bali, which parts it from the island of that\r\nname, is at the northern end not more than 1½ m. across. Through the\r\nformer strong currents run for the greater part of the day throughout\r\nthe year, outwards from the Java Sea to the Indian Ocean. In the strait\r\nof Bali the currents are perhaps even stronger and are extremely\r\nirregular. Pilots with local knowledge are absolutely necessary for\r\nvessels attempting either passage. In spite of the strength of the\r\ncurrents the Sunda Strait is steadily being diminished in width, and the\r\nprocess if continued must result in a restoration of that junction of\r\nSumatra and Java which according to some authorities formerly\r\nexisted.[2]\r\n\r\nIn general terms Java may be described as one of the breakwater islands\r\nof the Indian Ocean--part of the mountainous rim (continuous more or\r\nless completely with Sumatra) of the partially submerged plateau which\r\nlies between the ocean on the S. and the Chinese Sea on the N., and has\r\nthe massive island of Borneo as its chief subaerial portion. While the\r\nwaves and currents of the ocean sweep away most of the products of\r\ndenudation along the south coast or throw a small percentage back in the\r\nshape of sandy downs, the Java Sea on the north--not more than 50\r\nfathoms deep--allows them to settle and to form sometimes with\r\nextraordinary rapidity broad alluvial tracts.[3]\r\n\r\n  It is customary and obvious to divide Java into three divisions, the\r\n  middle part of the island narrowing into a kind of isthmus, and each\r\n  of the divisions thus indicated having certain structural\r\n  characteristics of its own. West Java, which consists of Bantam,\r\n  Krawang and the Preanger Regencies, has an area of upwards of 18,000\r\n  sq. m. In this division the highlands lie for the most part in a\r\n  compact mass to the south and the lowlands form a continuous tract to\r\n  the north. The main portion of the uplands consists of the Preanger\r\n  Mountains, with the plateaus of Bandong, Pekalongan, Tegal, Badung and\r\n  Gurut, encircled with volcanic summits. On the borders of the\r\n  Preanger, Batavia and Bantam are the Halimon Mountains (the Blue\r\n  Mountains of the older travellers), reaching their greatest altitudes\r\n  in the volcanic summits of Gedeh and Salak. To the west lie the\r\n  highlands of Bantam, which extending northward cut off the northern\r\n  lowlands from the Sunda Strait. Middle Java is the smallest of the\r\n  three divisions, having an area of not much more than 13,200 sq. m. It\r\n  comprises Tegal, Pekalongan, Banyumas, Bagelen, Kedu, Jokjakarta,\r\n  Surakarta, and thus not only takes in the whole of the isthmus but\r\n  encroaches on the broad eastern portion of the island. In the isthmus\r\n  mountains are not so closely massed in the south nor the plains so\r\n  continuous on the north. The watershed culminating in Slamet lies\r\n  almost midway between the ocean and the Java Sea, and there are\r\n  somewhat extensive lowlands in the south. In that part of middle Java\r\n  which physically belongs to eastern Java there is a remarkable series\r\n  of lowlands stretching almost right across the island from Semarang in\r\n  the north to Jokjakarta in the south. Eastern Java comprises Rembang,\r\n  Madiun, Kediri, Surabaya, Pasuruan and Besuki, and has an area of\r\n  about 17,500 sq. m. In this division lowlands and highlands are\r\n  intermingled in endless variety except along the south coast, where\r\n  the watershed-range forms a continuous breakwater from Jokjakarta to\r\n  Besuki. The volcanic eminences, instead of rising in lines or groups,\r\n  are isolated.\r\n\r\n  For its area Java is one of the most distinctly volcanic regions of\r\n  the world. Volcanic forces made it, and volcanic forces have continued\r\n  to devastate and fertilize it. According to R. D. M. Verbeek about 125\r\n  volcanic centres can be distinguished, a number which may be increased\r\n  or diminished by different methods of classification. It is usual to\r\n  arrange the volcanoes in the following groups: westernmost Java 11\r\n  (all extinct); Preanger 50 (5 active); Cheribon 2 (both extinct);\r\n  Slamet 2 (1 active); middle Java 16 (2 active); Murio 2 (both\r\n  extinct); Lavu 2 (extinct); Wilis 2 (extinct); east Java 21 (5\r\n  active). The active volcanoes of the present time are Gedeh,\r\n  Tangkuban, Prahu, Gutar, Papandayan, Galung-gung, Slamet, Sendor,\r\n  Merapi,[4] Kalut (or Klut), Bromo, Semeru, Lamongan, Raung, but the\r\n  activity of many of these is trifling, consisting of slight ejections\r\n  of steam and scoriae.\r\n\r\n  The plains differ in surface and fertility, according to their\r\n  geological formation. Built up of alluvium and diluvium, the plains of\r\n  the north coast-lands in western and middle Java are at their lowest\r\n  levels, near the mouths of rivers and the sea, in many cases marshy\r\n  and abounding in lakes and coral remains, but for the rest they are\r\n  fertile and available for culture. The plains, too, along the south\r\n  coast of middle Java--of Banyumas and Bagelen--contain many morasses\r\n  as well as sandy stretches and dunes impeding the outlet of the\r\n  rivers. They are, nevertheless, available for the cultivation more\r\n  particularly of rice, and are thickly peopled. In eastern Java, again,\r\n  the narrow coast plains are to be distinguished from the wider plains\r\n  lying between the parallel chains of limestone and between the\r\n  volcanoes. The narrow plains of the north coast are constituted of\r\n  yellow clay and tuffs containing chalk, washed down by the rivers from\r\n  the mountain chains and volcanoes. Like the western plains, they, too,\r\n  are in many cases low and marshy, and fringed with sand and dunes. The\r\n  plains, on the other hand, at some distance from the sea, or lying in\r\n  the interior of eastern Java, such as Surakarta, Madiun, Kediri,\r\n  Pasuruan, Probolinggo and Besuki, owe their formation to the volcanoes\r\n  at whose bases they lie, occupying levels as high as 1640 ft. down to\r\n  328 ft. above the sea, whence they decline to the lower plains of the\r\n  coast. Lastly, the plains of Lusi, Solo and Brantas, lying between the\r\n  parallel chains in Japara, Rembang and Surabaya, are in part the\r\n  product of rivers formerly flowing at a higher level of 30 to 60 or 70\r\n  ft., in part the product of the sea, dating from a time when the\r\n  northern part of the above-named residencies was an island, such as\r\n  Madura, the mountains of which are the continuation of the north\r\n  parallel chain, is still.\r\n\r\n  The considerable rivers of western Java all have their outlets on the\r\n  north coast, the chief among them being the Chi (Dutch Tji) Tarum and\r\n  the Chi Manuk. They are navigable for native boats and rafts, and are\r\n  used for the transport of coffee and salt. On the south coast the Chi\r\n  Tanduwi, on the east of the Preanger, is the only stream available as\r\n  a waterway, and this only for a few miles above its mouth. In middle\r\n  Java, also, the rivers discharging at the north coast--the Pamali,\r\n  Chomal, &c.--are serviceable for the purposes of irrigation and\r\n  cultivation, but are navigable only near their mouths. The rivers of\r\n  the south coast--Progo, Serayu, Bogowonto, and Upak, enriched by rills\r\n  from the volcanoes--serve abundantly to irrigate the plains of\r\n  Bagelen, Banyumas, &c. Their stony beds, shallows and rapids, and the\r\n  condition of their mouths lessen, however, their value as waterways.\r\n  More navigable are the larger rivers of eastern Java. The Solo is\r\n  navigable for large praus, or native boats, as far up as Surakarta,\r\n  and above that town for lighter boats, as is also its affluent the\r\n  Gentung. The canal constructed in 1893 at the lower part of this\r\n  river, and alterations effected at its mouth, have proved of important\r\n  service both in irrigating the plain and facilitating the river's\r\n  outlet into the sea. The Brantas is also navigable in several parts.\r\n  The smaller rivers of eastern Java are, however, much in the condition\r\n  of those of western Java. They serve less as waterways than as\r\n  reservoirs for the irrigation of the fertile plains through which they\r\n  flow.\r\n\r\n  The north coast of Java presents everywhere a low strand covered with\r\n  nipa or mangrove, morasses and fishponds, sandy stretches and low\r\n  dunes, shifting river-mouths and coast-lines, ports and roads,\r\n  demanding continual attention and regulation. The south coast is of a\r\n  different make. The dunes of Banyumas, Bagelen, and Jokjakarta, ranged\r\n  in three ridges, rising to 50 ft. high, and varying in breadth from\r\n  300 to over 1600 ft., liable, moreover, to transformation from tides\r\n  and the east monsoon, oppose everywhere, also in Preanger and Besuki,\r\n  a barrier to the discharge of the rivers and the drainage of the\r\n  coast-lands. They assist the formation of lagoons and morasses. At\r\n  intervals in the dune coast, running in the direction of the limestone\r\n  mountains, there tower up steep inaccessible masses of land, showing\r\n  neither ports nor bays, hollowed out by the sea, rising in\r\n  perpendicular walls to a height of 160 ft. above sea-level. Sometimes\r\n  two branches project at right angles from the chain on to the coast,\r\n  forming a low bay between the capes or ends of the projecting\r\n  branches, from 1000 to 1600 ft. high. Such a formation occurs\r\n  frequently along the coast of Besuki, presenting a very irregular\r\n  coast-line. Of course the north coast is of much greater commercial\r\n  importance than the south coast.\r\n\r\n  _Geology._--With the exception of a few small patches of schist,\r\n  supposed to be Cretaceous, the whole island, so far as is known, is\r\n  covered by deposits of Tertiary and Quaternary age. The ancient\r\n  \"schist formation,\" which occurs in Sumatra, Borneo, &c., does not\r\n  rise to the surface anywhere in Java itself, but it is visible in the\r\n  island of Karimon Java off the north coast. The Cretaceous schists\r\n  have yielded fossils only at Banjarnegara, where a limestone with\r\n  Orbitolina is interstratified with them. They are succeeded\r\n  unconformably by Eocene deposits, consisting of sandstones with\r\n  coal-seams and limestones containing Nummulites, Alveolina and\r\n  Orthophragmina; and these beds are as limited in extent as the\r\n  Cretaceous schists themselves. Sedimentary deposits of Upper Tertiary\r\n  age are widely spread, covering about 38% of the surface. They consist\r\n  of breccias, marls and limestones containing numerous fossils, and are\r\n  for the most part Miocene but probably include a part of the Pliocene\r\n  also. They were laid down beneath the sea, but have since been folded\r\n  and elevated to considerable heights. Fluviatile deposits of late\r\n  Pliocene age have been found in the east of Java, and it was in these\r\n  that the remarkable anthropoid ape or ape-like man, _Pithecanthropus\r\n  erectus_ of Dubois, was discovered. The Quaternary deposits lie\r\n  horizontally upon the upturned edges of the Tertiary beds. They are\r\n  partly marine and partly fluviatile, the marine deposits reaching to a\r\n  height of some 350 ft. above the sea and thus indicating a\r\n  considerable elevation of the island in recent times.\r\n\r\n  The volcanic rocks of Java are of great importance and cover about 28%\r\n  of the island. The eruptions began in the middle of the Tertiary\r\n  period, but did not attain their maximum until Quaternary times, and\r\n  many of the volcanoes are still active. Most of the cones seem to lie\r\n  along faults parallel to the axis of the island, or on short cross\r\n  fractures. The lavas and ashes are almost everywhere andesites and\r\n  basalts, with a little obsidian. Some of the volcanoes, however, have\r\n  erupted leucite rocks. Similar rocks, together with phonolite, occur\r\n  in the island of Bavian.[5]\r\n\r\n  _Climate._--Our knowledge of the climate of Batavia, and thus of that\r\n  of the lowlands of western Java, is almost perfect; but, rainfall\r\n  excepted, our information as to the climate of Java as a whole is\r\n  extremely defective. The dominant meteorological facts are simple and\r\n  obvious: Java lies in the tropics, under an almost vertical sun, and\r\n  thus has a day of almost uniform length throughout the year.[6] It is\r\n  also within the perpetual influence of the great atmospheric movements\r\n  passing between Asia and Australia; and is affected by the\r\n  neighbourhood of vast expanses of sea and land (Borneo and Sumatra).\r\n  There are no such maxima of temperature as are recorded from the\r\n  continents. The highest known at Batavia was 96° F. in 1877 and the\r\n  lowest 66° in the same year. The mean annual temperature is 79°. The\r\n  warmest months are May and October, registering 79.5° and 79.46°\r\n  respectively; the coldest January and February with 77.63° and 77.7°\r\n  respectively. The daily range is much greater; at one o'clock the\r\n  thermometer has a mean height of 84°; after two o'clock it declines to\r\n  about 73° at six o'clock; the greatest daily amplitude is in August\r\n  and the least in January and February. Eastern Java and the inland\r\n  plains of middle Java are said to be hotter, but scientific data are\r\n  few. A very slight degree of elevation above the seaboard plains\r\n  produces a remarkable difference in the climate, not so much in its\r\n  mere temperature as in its influence on health. The dwellers in the\r\n  coast towns are surprised at the invigorating effects of a change to\r\n  health resorts from 300 to 1200 ft. above sea-level; and at greater\r\n  elevations it may be uncomfortably cold at night, with chilly mists\r\n  and occasional frosts. The year is divided into two seasons by the\r\n  prevailing winds: the rainy season, that of the west monsoon, lasting\r\n  from November to March, and the dry season, that of the east monsoon,\r\n  during the rest of the year; the transition from one monsoon to\r\n  another--the \"canting\" of the monsoons--being marked by\r\n  irregularities. On the whole, the east monsoon blows steadily for a\r\n  longer period than the west. The velocity of the wind is much less\r\n  than in Europe--not more in the annual mean at Batavia than 3 ft. per\r\n  second, against 12 to 18 ft. in Europe. The highest velocity ever\r\n  observed at Batavia was 25 ft. Wind-storms are rare and hardly ever\r\n  cyclonic. There are as a matter of course a large number of purely\r\n  local winds, some of them of a very peculiar kind, but few of these\r\n  have been scientifically dealt with. Thunder-storms are extremely\r\n  frequent; but the loss of life from lightning is probably diminished\r\n  by the fact that the palm-trees are excellent conductors. At night the\r\n  air is almost invariably still. The average rainfall at Batavia is\r\n  72.28 in. per annum, of which 51.49 in. are contributed by the west\r\n  monsoon. The amount varies considerably from year to year: in 1889,\r\n  1891 and 1897 there were about 47.24 in.; in 1868 and 1877 nearly\r\n  51.17, and in 1872 and 1882 no less than 94.8. There are no long\r\n  tracts of unbroken rainfall and no long periods of continuous drought.\r\n  The rainfall is heaviest in January, but it rains only for about\r\n  one-seventh of the time. Next in order come February, March and\r\n  December. August, the driest month, has from three to five days of\r\n  rain, though the amount is usually less than an inch and not more than\r\n  one and a half inches. The popular description of the rain falling not\r\n  in drops but streams was proved erroneous by J. Wiesner's careful\r\n  observations (see _Kais. Akad. d. Wiss. Math. Naturw. Cl._ Bd. xiv.,\r\n  Vienna, 1895), which have been confirmed by A. Woeikof\r\n  (\"Regensintensität und Regendauer in Batavia\" in _Z. für Met._, 1907).\r\n  The greatest rainfall recorded in an hour (4.5 in.) is enormously\r\n  exceeded by records even in Europe. From observations taken for the\r\n  meteorological authorities at a very considerable number of stations,\r\n  J. H. Boeseken constructed a map in 1900 (_Tijdschr. v. h. Kon. Ned.\r\n  Aardr. Gen._, 1900; reproduced in Veth, _Java_, iii. 1903). Among the\r\n  outstanding facts are the following. The south coasts of both eastern\r\n  and middle Java have a much heavier rainfall than the north. Majalenka\r\n  has an annual fall of 175 in. In western Java the maximal district\r\n  consists of a great ring of mountains from Salak and Gedeh in the west\r\n  to Galung-gung in the east, while the enclosed plateau-region of\r\n  Chanjur Bandung and Garut are not much different from the seaboard.\r\n  The whole of middle Java, with the exception of the north coast, has a\r\n  heavy rainfall. At Chilachap the annual rainfall is 151.43 in., 87.8\r\n  in. of which is brought by the south-east monsoon. The great belt\r\n  which includes the Slamet and the Dieng, and the country on the south\r\n  coast between Chilachap and Parigi, are maximal. In comparison the\r\n  whole of eastern Java, with the exception of the mountains from Wilis\r\n  eastward to Ijen, has a low record which reaches its lowest along the\r\n  north coast.[7]\r\n\r\n  _Fauna._--In respect of its fauna Java differs from Borneo, Sumatra\r\n  and the Malay Peninsula far more than these differ among themselves;\r\n  and, at the same time, it shows a close resemblance to the Malay\r\n  Peninsula, on the one hand, and to the Himalayas on the other. Of the\r\n  176 mammals of the whole Indo-Malayan region the greater number occur\r\n  in Java. Of these 41 are found on the continent of Asia, 8 are common\r\n  to Java and Borneo, and 6 are common to Java and Sumatra (see M.\r\n  Weber, _Das Indo-Malay Archipelago und die Geschichte seiner\r\n  Thierwelt_, Jena, 1902). No genus and only a few species are confined\r\n  to the island. Of the land-birds only a small proportion are peculiar.\r\n  The elephant, the tapir, the bear, and various other genera found in\r\n  the rest of the region are altogether absent. The Javanese rhinoceros\r\n  (_Rhinoceros sundaicus_; _sarak_ in Javanese, _badak_ in Sundanese),\r\n  the largest of the mammals on the island, differs from that of Sumatra\r\n  in having one horn instead of two. It ranges over the highest\r\n  mountains, and its regular paths, worn into deep channels, may be\r\n  traced up the steepest slopes and round the rims of even active\r\n  volcanoes. Two species of wild swine, _Sus vittatus_ and _Sus\r\n  verrucosus_, are exceedingly abundant, the former in the hot, the\r\n  latter in the temperate, region; and their depredations are the cause\r\n  of much loss to the natives, who, however, being Mahommedans, to whom\r\n  pork is abhorrent, do not hunt them for the sake of their flesh. Not\r\n  much less than the rhinoceros is the banteng (_Bibos banteng_ or\r\n  _sundaicus_) found in all the uninhabited districts between 2000 and\r\n  7000 ft. of elevation. The kidang or muntjak (_Cervulus muntjac_) and\r\n  the rusa or russa (_Rusa hippelaphus_ or _Russa russa_) are the\r\n  representatives of the deer kind. The former is a delicate little\r\n  creature occurring singly or in pairs both in the mountains and in the\r\n  coast districts; the latter lives in herds of fifty to a hundred in\r\n  the grassy opens, giving excellent sport to the native hunters.\r\n  Another species (_Russa kuhlii_) exists in Bavian. The kantjil\r\n  (_Tragulus javanicus_) is a small creature allied to the musk-deer but\r\n  forming a genus by itself. It lives in the high woods, for the most\r\n  part singly, seldom in pairs. It is one of the most peculiar of the\r\n  Javanese mammals. The royal tiger, the same species as that of India,\r\n  is still common enough to make a tiger-hunt a characteristic Javanese\r\n  scene. The leopard (_Felis pardus_) is frequent in the warm regions\r\n  and often ascends to considerable altitudes. Black specimens\r\n  occasionally occur, but the spots are visible on inspection; and the\r\n  fact that in the Amsterdam zoological gardens a black leopard had one\r\n  of its cubs black and the other normally spotted shows that this is\r\n  only a case of melanism. In the tree-tops the birds find a dangerous\r\n  enemy in the matjan rembak, or wild cat (_Felis minuta_), about the\r\n  size of a common cat. The dog tribe is represented by the fox-like\r\n  adjag (_Cuon_ or _Canis sutilans_) which hunts in ferocious packs; and\r\n  by a wild dog, _Canis tenggeranus_, if this is not now exterminated.\r\n  The Cheiroptera hold a prominent place in the fauna, the principal\r\n  genera being _Pteropus_, _Cynonycteris_, _Cynopterus_ and\r\n  _Macroglossus_. Remarkable especially for size is the kalong, or\r\n  flying fox, _Pteropus edulis_, a fruit-eating bat, which may be seen\r\n  hanging during the day in black clusters asleep on the trees, and in\r\n  the evening hastening in long lines to the favourite feeding grounds\r\n  in the forest. The damage these do to the young coco-nut trees, the\r\n  maize and the sugar-palms leads the natives to snare and shoot them;\r\n  and their flesh is a favourite food with Europeans, who prefer to\r\n  shoot them by night as, if shot by day, they often cling after death\r\n  to the branches. Smaller kinds of bats are most abundant, perhaps the\r\n  commonest being _Scotophilus Temminckii_. In certain places they\r\n  congregate in myriads, like sea-fowl on the cliffs, and their\r\n  excrement produces extensive guano deposits utilized by the people of\r\n  Surakarta and Madiun. The creature known to the Europeans as the\r\n  flying-cat and to the natives as the kubin is the _Galeopithecus\r\n  volans_ or _variagatus_--a sort of transition from the bats to the\r\n  lemuroids. Of these last Java has several species held in awe by the\r\n  natives for their supposed power of fascination. The apes are\r\n  represented by the wou-wou (_Hylobates leuciscus_), the lutung, and\r\n  kowi (_Semnopithecus maurus_ and _pyrrhus_), the surili\r\n  (_Semnopithecus mitratus_), and the munyuk (_Cercocebus_, or _Macacus,\r\n  cynamolgos_), the most generally distributed of all. From sunrise to\r\n  sunset the wou-wou makes its presence known, especially in the second\r\n  zone where it congregates in the trees, by its strange cry, at times\r\n  harsh and cacophonous, at times weird and pathetic. The lutung or\r\n  black ape also prefers the temperate region, though it is met with as\r\n  high as 7000 ft. above the sea and as low as 2000. The _Cercocebus_ or\r\n  grey ape keeps for the most part to the warm coast lands. Rats\r\n  (including the brown Norway rat, often called _Mus javanicus_, as if\r\n  it were a native; a great plague); mice in great variety; porcupines\r\n  (_Acanthion javanicum_); squirrels (five species) and flying squirrels\r\n  (four species) represent the rodents. A hare, _Lepus nigricollis_,\r\n  originally from Ceylon, has a very limited habitat; the Insectivora\r\n  comprise a shrew-mouse (_Rachyura indica_), two species of tupaya and\r\n  _Hylomys suillus_ peculiar to Java and Sumatra. The nearest relation\r\n  to the bears is _Arctictis binturong_. _Mydaus meliceps_ and _Helictis\r\n  orientalis_ represent the badgers. In the upper part of the mountains\r\n  occurs _Mustela Henrici_, and an otter (_Aonyx leptonyx_) in the\r\n  streams of the hot zone. The coffee rat (_Paradoxurus\r\n  hermaphroditus_), a civet cat (_Viverricida indica_), the Javanese\r\n  ichneumon (_Herpestes javanicus_), and _Priodon gracilis_ may also be\r\n  mentioned.\r\n\r\n  In 1820, 176 species of birds were known in Java; by 1900 Vorderman\r\n  and O. Finsch knew 410. Many of these are, of course, rare and occupy\r\n  a limited habitat far from the haunts of man. Others exist in myriads\r\n  and are characteristic features in the landscape. Water-fowl of many\r\n  kinds, ducks, geese, storks, pelicans, &c., give life to sea-shore and\r\n  lake, river and marsh. Snipe-shooting is a favourite sport. Common\r\n  night-birds are the owl (_Strix flammea_) and the goat-sucker\r\n  (_Caprimulgus affinis_). Three species of hornbill, the year-bird of\r\n  the older travellers (_Buceros plicatus_, _lunatus_ and _albirostris_)\r\n  live in the tall trees of the forest zone. The Javanese peacock is a\r\n  distinct species (_Pavo muticus_ or _spiciferus_), and even exceeds\r\n  the well-known Indian species in the splendour of its plumage. _Gallus\r\n  Bankiva_ is famous as the reputed parent of all barn-door fowls;\r\n  _Gallus furcatus_ is an exquisitely beautiful bird and can be trained\r\n  for cock-fighting. Of parrots two species only are known: _Palaeornis\r\n  Alexandri_ or _javanicus_ and the pretty little grass-green _Curyllis\r\n  pusilla_, peculiar to Java. As talkers and mimics they are beaten by\r\n  the _Gracula javanensis_, a favourite cage-bird with the natives. A\r\n  cuckoo, _Chrysococcyx basalis_, may be heard in the second zone. The\r\n  grass-fields are the foraging-grounds of swarms of weaver-birds\r\n  (_Plocula javanensis_ and _Ploccus baya_). They lay nearly as heavy a\r\n  toll on the rice-fields as the gelatiks (_Munia oryzivora_), which are\r\n  everywhere the rice-growers' principal foe. Hawks and falcons make\r\n  both an easy prey. The _Nictuarinas_ or honey-birds (eight species)\r\n  take the place of the humming-bird, which they rival in beauty and\r\n  diminutiveness, ranging from the lowlands to an altitude of 4000 ft.\r\n  In the upper regions the birds, like the plants, are more like those\r\n  of Europe, and some of them--notably the kanchilan (_Hyloterpe\r\n  Philomela_)--are remarkable for their song. The edible-nest swallow\r\n  (_Collocalia fuciphaga_) builds in caves in many parts of the\r\n  island.[8]\r\n\r\n  As far back as 1859 P. Bleeker credited Java with eleven hundred\r\n  species of fish; and naturalists are perpetually adding to the\r\n  number.[9] In splendour and grotesqueness of colouring many kinds, as\r\n  is well known, look rather like birds than fish. In the neighbourhood\r\n  of Batavia about three hundred and eighty species are used as food by\r\n  the natives and the Chinese, who have added to the number by the\r\n  introduction of the goldfish, which reaches a great size. The sea fish\r\n  most prized by Europeans is _Lates calcarifer_ (a perch). Of more than\r\n  one hundred species of snakes about twenty-four species (including\r\n  the cobra di capella) are poisonous and these are responsible for the\r\n  deaths of between one hundred and two hundred persons per annum.\r\n  Adders and lizards are abundant. Geckos are familiar visitants in the\r\n  houses of the natives. There are two species of crocodiles.\r\n\r\n  As in other tropical-rain forest lands the variety and abundance of\r\n  insects are amazing. At sundown the air becomes resonant for hours\r\n  with their myriad voices. The _Coleoptera_ and the _Lepidoptera_ form\r\n  the glory of all great collections for their size and magnificence. Of\r\n  butterflies proper five hundred species are known. Of the beetles one\r\n  of the largest and handsomest is _Chalcosoma atlas_. Among the spiders\r\n  (a numerously represented order) the most notable is a bird-killing\r\n  species, _Selene scomia javanensis_. In many parts the island is\r\n  plagued with ants, termites and mosquitoes. Crops of all kinds are\r\n  subject to disastrous attacks of creeping and winged foes--many still\r\n  unidentified (see especially Snellen van Hollenhoven, _Essai d'une\r\n  faune entomologique de l'Archipel Indo-néerlandais_). Of still lower\r\n  forms of life the profusion is no less perplexing. Among the worms the\r\n  _Perichaeta musica_ reaches a length of about twenty inches and\r\n  produces musical sounds. The shell of the _Tridacna gigas_ is the\r\n  largest anywhere known.\r\n\r\n  _Flora._--For the botanist Java is a natural paradise, affording him\r\n  the means of studying the effects of moisture and heat, of\r\n  air-currents and altitudes, without the interference of superincumbent\r\n  arctic conditions. The botanic gardens of Buitenzorg have long been\r\n  famous for their wealth of material, the ability with which their\r\n  treasures have been accumulated and displayed, their value in\r\n  connexion with the economic development of the island and the\r\n  extensive scientific literature published by their directors.[10]\r\n  There is a special establishment at Chibodas open to students of all\r\n  nations for the investigation on the spot of the conditions of the\r\n  primeval forest. Hardly any similar area in the world has a flora of\r\n  richer variety than Java. It is estimated that the total number of the\r\n  species of plants is about 5000; but this is probably under the mark\r\n  (De Candolle knew of 2605 phanerogamous species), and new genera and\r\n  species of an unexpected character are from time to time discovered.\r\n  The lower parts of the island are always in the height of summer. The\r\n  villages and even the smaller towns are in great measure concealed by\r\n  the abundant and abiding verdure; and their position in the landscape\r\n  is to be recognized mainly by their groves, orchards and cultivated\r\n  fields. The amount and distribution of heat and moisture at the\r\n  various seasons of the year form the dominant factors in determining\r\n  the character of the vegetation. Thus trees which are evergreen in\r\n  west Java are deciduous in the east of the island, some dropping their\r\n  leaves (e.g. _Tetrameles nudiflora_) at the very time they are in\r\n  bloom or ripening their fruit. This and other contrasts are\r\n  graphically described from personal observation by A. F. W. Schimper\r\n  in his _Pflanzen-Geographie auf physiologischer Grundlage_ (Jena,\r\n  1898). The abundance of epiphytes, orchids, pitcher-plants, mosses and\r\n  fungi is a striking result of the prevalent humidity; and many trees\r\n  and plants indeed, which in drier climates root in the soil, derive\r\n  sufficient moisture from their stronger neighbours. Of orchids J. J.\r\n  Smith records 562 species (100 genera), but the flowers of all except\r\n  about a score are inconspicuous. This last fact is the more remarkable\r\n  because, taken generally, the Javanese vegetation differs from that of\r\n  many other tropical countries by being abundantly and often gorgeously\r\n  floriferous. Many of the loftiest trees crown themselves with blossoms\r\n  and require no assistance from the climbing plants that seek, as it\r\n  were, to rival them in their display of colour. Shrubs, too, and\r\n  herbaceous plants often give brilliant effects in the savannahs, the\r\n  deserted clearings, the edges of the forest and the sides of the\r\n  highways. The _lantana_, a verbenaceous alien introduced, it is said,\r\n  from Jamaica by Lady Raffles, has made itself aggressively conspicuous\r\n  in many parts of the island, more especially in the Preanger and\r\n  middle Java, where it occupies areas of hundreds of acres.\r\n\r\n  The effect of mere altitude in the distribution of the flora was long\r\n  ago emphasized by Friedrich Junghuhn, the Humboldt of Java, who\r\n  divided the island into four vertical botanical zones--a division\r\n  which has generally been accepted by his successors, though, like all\r\n  such divisions, it is subject to many modifications and exceptions.\r\n  The forest, or hot zone, extends to a height of 2000 ft. above the\r\n  sea; the second, that of moderate heat, has its upper limit at about\r\n  4500; the third, or cool, zone reaches 7500; and the fourth, or\r\n  coldest, comprises all that lies beyond. The lowest zone has, of\r\n  course, the most extensive area; the second is only a fiftieth and the\r\n  third a five-thousandth of the first; and the fourth is an\r\n  insignificant remainder. The lowest is the region of the true tropical\r\n  forest, of rice-fields and sugar-plantations, of coco-nut palms,\r\n  cotton, sesamum, cinnamon and tobacco (though this last has a wide\r\n  altitudinal range). Many parts of the coast (especially on the north)\r\n  are fringed with mangrove (_Rhizophora mucronata_), &c., and species\r\n  of _Bruguiera_; the downs have their characteristic flora--convolvulus\r\n  and _Spinifex squarrosus_ catching the eye for very different\r\n  reasons. Farther inland along the seaboard appear the nipa dwarf palm\r\n  (_Nipa fruticans_), the _Alsbonia scholaris_ (the wood of which is\r\n  lighter than cork), Cycadacea, tree-ferns, screw pines (_Pandanus_),\r\n  &c. In west Java the gebang palm (_Corypha gebanga_) grows in clumps\r\n  and belts not far from but never quite close to the coast; and in east\r\n  Java a similar position is occupied by the lontar (_Borassus\r\n  flabelliformis_), valuable for its timber, its sago and its sugar, and\r\n  in former times for its leaves, which were used as a writing-material.\r\n  The fresh-water lakes and ponds of this region are richly covered with\r\n  Utricularia and various kinds of lotus (_Nymphaea lotus_, _N.\r\n  stellata_, _Nelumbium speciosum_, &c.) interspersed with _Pista\r\n  stratiotes_ and other floating plants. Vast prairies are covered with\r\n  the silvery alang-alang grass broken by bamboo thickets, clusters of\r\n  trees and shrubs (_Butea frondosa_, _Emblica officinalis_, &c.) and\r\n  islands of the taller erigedeh or glagah (_Saccharum spontaneum_).\r\n  Alang-alang (_Imperata arundinacea_, Cyr. var. Bentham) grows from 1\r\n  to 4 ft. in height. It springs up wherever the ground is cleared of\r\n  trees and is a perfect plague to the cultivator. It cannot hold its\r\n  own, however, with the ananas, the kratok (_Phaseolus lunatus_) or the\r\n  lantana; and, in the natural progress of events, the forest resumes\r\n  its sway except where the natives encourage the young growth of the\r\n  grass by annually setting the prairies on fire. The true forest, which\r\n  occupies a great part of this region, changes its character as we\r\n  proceed from west to east. In west Java it is a dense rain-forest in\r\n  which the struggle of existence is maintained at high pressure by a\r\n  host of lofty trees and parasitic plants in bewildering profusion. The\r\n  preponderance of certain types is remarkable. Thus of the Moraceae\r\n  there are in Java (and mostly here) seven genera with ninety-five\r\n  species, eighty-three of which are _Ficus_ (see S. H. Koorders and T.\r\n  Valeton, \"Boomsoorten op Java\" in _Bijdr. Mede. Dep. Landbower_\r\n  (1906). These include the so-called waringin, several kinds of figs\r\n  planted as shade-trees in the parks of the nobles and officials. The\r\n  Magnoliaceae and Anonaceae are both numerously represented. In middle\r\n  Java the variety of trees is less, a large area being occupied by\r\n  teak. In eastern Java the character of the forest is mainly determined\r\n  by the abundance of the Casuarina or Chimoro (_C. montana_ and _C.\r\n  Junghuhniana_). Another species, _C. equisetifolia_, is planted in\r\n  west Java as an ornamental tree. These trees are not crowded together\r\n  and encumbered with the heavy parasitic growths of the rain-forest;\r\n  but their tall stems are often covered with multitudes of small\r\n  vermilion fungi. Wherever the local climate has sufficient humidity,\r\n  the true rain-forest claims its own. The second of Junghuhn's zones is\r\n  the region of, more especially, tea, cinchona and coffee plantations,\r\n  of maize and the sugar palm (areng). In the forest the trees are\r\n  richly clad with ferns and enormous fungi; there is a profusion of\r\n  underwood (_Pavetta macrophylla Javanica_ and _salicifolia_; several\r\n  species of _Lasianthus_, _Boehmarias_, _Strobilanthus_, &c.), of woody\r\n  lianas and ratans, of tree ferns (especially Alsophila). Between the\r\n  bushes the ground is covered with ferns, lycopods, tradescantias,\r\n  Bignoniaceae, species of _Aeschynanthus_. Of the lianas the largest is\r\n  _Plectocomia elongata_; one specimen of which was found to have a\r\n  length of nearly 790 ft. One of the fungi, _Telephora princeps_, is\r\n  more than a yard in diameter. The trees are of different species from\r\n  those of the hot zone even when belonging to the same genus; and new\r\n  types appear mostly in limited areas. The third zone, which consists\r\n  mainly of the upper slopes of volcanic mountains, but also comprises\r\n  several plateaus (the Dieng, parts of the Tengger, the Ijen) is a\r\n  region of clouds and mists. There are a considerable number of lakes\r\n  and swamps in several parts of the region, and these have a luxuriant\r\n  environment of grasses, Cyperaceae, Characeae and similar forms. The\r\n  taller trees of the region--oaks, chestnuts, various Lauraceae, and\r\n  four or five species of _Podocarpus_--with some striking exceptions,\r\n  _Astronia spectabilis_, &c., are less floriferous than those of the\r\n  lower zones; but the shrubs (_Rhododendron javanicum_, _Ardisia\r\n  javanica_, &c.), herbs and parasites more than make up for this\r\n  defect. There is little cultivation, except in the Tengger, where the\r\n  natives grow maize, rye and tobacco, and various European vegetables\r\n  (cabbage, potatoes, &c.), with which they supply the lowland markets.\r\n  In western Java one of the most striking features of the upper parts\r\n  of this temperate region is what Schimper calls the \"absolute dominion\r\n  of mosses,\" associated with the \"elfin forest,\" as he quaintly calls\r\n  it, a perfect tangle of \"low, thick, oblique or even horizontal\r\n  stems,\" almost choked to leaflessness by their grey and ghostly\r\n  burden. Much of the lower vegetation begins to have a European aspect;\r\n  violets, primulas, thalictrums, ranunculus, vacciniums, equisetums,\r\n  rhododendrons (_Rhod. retusum_). The _Primula imperialis_, found only\r\n  on the Pangerango, is a handsome species, prized by specialists. In\r\n  the fourth or alpine zone occur such distinctly European forms as\r\n  _Artemisia vulgaris_, _Plantago major_, _Solanum nigrum_, _Stellaria\r\n  media_; and altogether the alpine flora contains representatives of no\r\n  fewer than thirty-three families. A characteristic shrub is _Anaphalis\r\n  javanica_, popularly called the Javanese edelweiss, which \"often\r\n  entirely excludes all other woody plants.\"[11] The tallest and noblest\r\n  of all the trees in the island is the rasamala or liquid-ambar\r\n  (_Altingia excelsa_), which, rising with a straight clean trunk,\r\n  sometimes 6 ft. in diameter at the base, to a height of 100 to 130\r\n  ft., spreads out into a magnificent crown of branches and foliage.\r\n  When by chance a climbing plant has joined partnership with it, the\r\n  combination of blossoms at the top is one of the finest colour effects\r\n  of the forest. The rasamala, however, occurs only in the Preanger and\r\n  in the neighbouring parts of Bantam and Buitenzorg. Of the other trees\r\n  that may be classified as timber--from 300 to 400 species--many attain\r\n  noble proportions. It is sufficient to mention _Calophyllum\r\n  inophyllum_, which forms fine woods in the south of Bantam, _Mimusops\r\n  acuminata_, _Irna glabra_, _Dalbergia latifolia_ (sun wood, English\r\n  black-wood) in middle and east Java; the rare but splendid\r\n  _Pithecolobium Junghuhnianum_; _Schima Noronhae_, _Bischofia\r\n  javanica_, _Pterospermum javanicum_ (greatly prized for\r\n  ship-building), and the upas-tree. From the economic point of view all\r\n  these hundreds of trees are of less importance than _Tectona grandis_,\r\n  the jati or teak, which, almost to the exclusion of all others,\r\n  occupies about a third of the government forest-lands. It grows best\r\n  in middle and eastern Java, preferring the comparatively dry and hot\r\n  climate of the plains and lower hills to a height of about 2000 ft.\r\n  above the sea, and thriving best in more or less calciferous soils. In\r\n  June it sheds its leaves and begins to bud again in October.\r\n  Full-grown trees reach a height of 100 to 150 ft. In 1895 teak (with a\r\n  very limited quantity of other timber) was felled to the value of\r\n  about £101,800, and in 1904 the corresponding figure was about\r\n  £119,935.\r\n\r\n  That an island which has for so long maintained a dense and growing\r\n  population in its more cultivable regions should have such extensive\r\n  tracts of primeval or quasi-primeval forest as have been above\r\n  indicated would be matter of surprise to one who did not consider the\r\n  simplicity of the life of the Javanese. They require but little fuel;\r\n  and both their dwellings and their furniture are mostly constructed of\r\n  bamboo supplemented with a palm or two. They destroy the forest mainly\r\n  to get room for their rice-fields and pasture for their cattle. In\r\n  doing this, however, they are often extremely reckless and wasteful;\r\n  and if it had not been for the unusual humidity of the climate their\r\n  annual fires would have resulted in widespread conflagrations. As it\r\n  is, many mountains are now bare which within historic times were\r\n  forested to the top; but the Dutch government has proved fully alive\r\n  to the danger of denudation. The state has control of all the woods\r\n  and forests of the island with the exception of those of the Preanger,\r\n  the \"particular lands,\" and Madura; and it has long been engaged in\r\n  replanting with native trees and experimenting with aliens from other\r\n  parts of the world--_Eucalyptus globulus_, the juar, _Cassia florida_\r\n  from Sumatra, the surian (_Cedrela febrifuga_), &c. The greatest\r\n  success has been with cinchona.\r\n\r\n  Left to itself Java would soon clothe itself again with even a richer\r\n  natural vegetation than it had when it was first occupied by man. The\r\n  open space left by the demolition of the fortifications on Nusa\r\n  Kambangan was in twenty-eight years densely covered by thousands of\r\n  shrubs and trees of about twenty varieties, many of the latter 80 ft.\r\n  high. Resident Snijthoff succeeded about the close of the 19th century\r\n  in re-afforesting a large part of Mount Muriå by the simple expedient\r\n  of protecting the territory he had to deal with from all encroachments\r\n  by natives.[12]\r\n\r\n_Population._--The population of Java (including Madura, &c.) was\r\n30,098,008 in 1905. In 1900 it was 28,746,688; in 1890, 23,912,564; and\r\nin 1880, 19,794,505. The natives consist of the Javanese proper, the\r\nSundanese and the Madurese. All three belong to the Malay stock. Between\r\nJavanese and Sundanese the distinction is mainly due to the influence of\r\nthe Hindus on the former and the absence of this on the latter. Between\r\nJavanese and Madurese the distinction is rather to be ascribed to\r\ndifference of natural environment. The Sundanese have best retained the\r\nMalay type, both in physique and fashion of life. They occupy the west\r\nof the island. The Madurese area, besides the island of Madura and\r\nneighbouring isles, includes the eastern part of Java itself. The\r\nresidencies of Tegal, Pekalongan, Banyumas, Bagelen, Kedu, Semarang,\r\nJapara, Surakarta, Jokjakarta, Rembang, Madiun, Kediri and Surabaya have\r\nan almost purely Javanese population. The Javanese are the most numerous\r\nand civilized of the three peoples.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the skin in all three cases presents various shades of\r\nyellowish-brown; and it is observed that, owing perhaps to the Hindu\r\nstrain, the Javanese are generally darker than the Sundanese. The eyes\r\nare always brown or black, the hair of the head black, long, lank and\r\ncoarse. Neither breast nor limbs are provided with hair, and there is\r\nhardly even the suggestion of a beard. In stature the Sundanese is less\r\nthan the Javanese proper, being little over 5 ft. in average height,\r\nwhereas the Javanese is nearly 5½ ft.; at the same time the Sundanese is\r\nmore stoutly built. The Madurese is as tall as the Javanese, and as\r\nstout as the Sundanese. The eye is usually set straight in the head in\r\nthe Javanese and Madurese; among the Sundanese it is often oblique. The\r\nnose is generally flat and small, with wide nostrils, although among the\r\nJavanese it not infrequently becomes aquiline. The lips are thick, yet\r\nwell formed; the teeth are naturally white, but often filed and stained.\r\nThe cheek-bones are well developed, more particularly with the Madurese.\r\nIn expressiveness of countenance the Javanese and Madurese are far in\r\nadvance of the Sundanese. The women are not so well made as the men, and\r\namong the lower classes especially soon grow absolutely ugly. In the\r\neyes of the Javanese a golden yellow complexion is the perfection of\r\nfemale beauty. To judge by their early history, the Javanese must have\r\nbeen a warlike and vigorous people, but now they are peaceable, docile,\r\nsober, simple and industrious.\r\n\r\nOne million only out of the twenty-six millions of natives are\r\nconcentrated in towns, a fact readily explained by their sources of\r\nlivelihood. The great bulk of the population is distributed over the\r\ncountry in villages usually called by Europeans dessas, from the Low\r\nJavanese word _déså_ (High Javanese _dusun_). Every dessa, however small\r\n(and those containing from 100 to 1000 families are exceptionally\r\nlarge), forms an independent community; and no sooner does it attain to\r\nany considerable size than it sends off a score of families or so to\r\nform a new dessa. Each lies in the midst of its own area of cultivation.\r\nThe general enceinte is formed by an impervious hedge of bamboos 40 to\r\n70 ft. high. Within this lie the houses, each with its own enclosure,\r\nwhich, even when the fields are the communal property, belongs to the\r\nindividual householder. The capital of a district is only a larger\r\ndessa, and that of a regency has the same general type, but includes\r\nseveral kampongs or villages. The bamboo houses in the strictly Javanese\r\ndistricts are always built on the ground; in the Sunda lands they are\r\nraised on piles. Some of the well-to-do, however, have stone houses. The\r\nprincipal article of food is rice; a considerable quantity of fish is\r\neaten, but little meat. Family life is usually well ordered. The upper\r\nclass practise polygamy, but among the common people a man has generally\r\nonly one wife. The Javanese are nominally Mahommedans, as in former\r\ntimes they were Buddhists and Brahmins; but in reality, not only such\r\nexceptional groups as the Kalangs of Surakarta and Jokjakarta and the\r\nBaduwis or nomad tribes of Bantam, but the great mass of the people must\r\nbe considered as believers rather in the primitive animism of their\r\nancestors, for their belief in Islam is overlaid with superstition. As\r\nwe ascend in the social scale, however, we find the name of Mahommedan\r\nmore and more applicable; and consequently in spite of the paganism of\r\nthe populace the influence of the Mahommedan \"priests\" (this is their\r\nofficial title in Dutch) is widespread and real. Great prestige attaches\r\nto the pilgrimage to Mecca, which was made by 5068 persons from Java in\r\n1900. In every considerable town there is a mosque. Christian missionary\r\nwork is not very widely spread.\r\n\r\n  _Languages._--In spite of Sundanese, Madurese and the intrusive Malay,\r\n  Javanese has a right to the name. It is a rich and cultivated language\r\n  which has passed through many stages of development and, under\r\n  peculiar influences, has become a linguistic complex of an almost\r\n  unique kind. Though it is customary and convenient to distinguish New\r\n  Javanese from Kavi or Old Javanese, just as it was customary to\r\n  distinguish English from Anglo-Saxon, there is no break of historical\r\n  continuity. Kavi (Basa Kavi, i.e. the language of poetry) may be\r\n  defined as the form spoken and written before the founding of\r\n  Majapahit; and middle Javanese, still represented by the dialect of\r\n  Banyumas, north Cheribon, north Krawang and north Bantam, as the form\r\n  the language assumed under the Majapahit court influence; while New\r\n  Javanese is the language as it has developed since the fall of that\r\n  kingdom. Kavi continued to be a literary language long after it had\r\n  become archaic. It contains more Sanskrit than any other language of\r\n  the archipelago. New Javanese breaks up into two great varieties, so\r\n  different that sometimes they are regarded as two distinct languages.\r\n  The nobility use one form, Kråmå; the common people another, Ngoko,\r\n  the \"thouing\" language (cf. Fr. _tutoyant_, Ger. _dutzend_); but each\r\n  class understands the language of the other class. The aristocrat\r\n  speaks to the commonalty in the language of the commoner; the\r\n  commoner speaks to the aristocracy in the language of the aristocrat;\r\n  and, according to clearly recognized etiquette, every Javanese plays\r\n  the part of aristocrat or commoner towards those whom he addresses. To\r\n  speak Ngoko to a superior is to insult him; to speak Kråmå to an equal\r\n  or inferior is a mark of respect. In this way Dipå Negårå showed his\r\n  contempt for the Dutch General de Kock. The ordinary Javanese thinks\r\n  in Ngoko; the children use it to each other, and so on. Between the\r\n  two forms there is a kind of compromise, the Madya, or middle form of\r\n  speech, employed by those who stand to each other on equal or friendly\r\n  footing or by those who feel little constraint of etiquette. For every\r\n  idea expressed in the language Kråmå has one vocable, the Ngoko\r\n  another, the two words being sometimes completely different and\r\n  sometimes differing only in the termination, the beginning or the\r\n  middle. Thus every Javanese uses, as it were, two or even three\r\n  languages delicately differentiated from each other. How this state of\r\n  affairs came about is matter of speculation. Almost certainly the\r\n  existence side by side of two peoples, speaking each its own tongue,\r\n  and occupying towards each other the position intellectually and\r\n  politically of superior and inferior, had much to do with it. But\r\n  Professor Kern thinks that some influence must also be assigned to\r\n  _pamela_ or _pantang_, word-taboo--certain words being in certain\r\n  circumstances regarded as of evil omen--a superstition still\r\n  lingering, e.g. even among the Shetland fishermen (see G. A. F. Hazeu,\r\n  _De taal pantangs_). It has sometimes been asserted that Kråmå\r\n  contains more Sanskrit words than Ngoko does; but the total number in\r\n  Kråmå does not exceed 20; and sometimes there is a Sanskrit word in\r\n  Ngoko which is not in Kråmå. There is a village Kråmå which is not\r\n  recognized by the educated classes: Kråmå inggil, with a vocabulary of\r\n  about 300 words, is used in addressing the deity or persons of exalted\r\n  rank. The Basa Kedaton or court language is a dialect used by all\r\n  living at court except royalties, who use Ngoko. Among themselves the\r\n  women of the court employ Kråmå or Madya, but they address the men in\r\n  Basa Kedaton.[13]\r\n\r\n  _Literature._--Though a considerable body of Kavi literature is still\r\n  extant, nothing like a history of it is possible. The date and\r\n  authorship of most of the works are totally unknown. The first place\r\n  may be assigned to the _Brata Yuda_ (Sansk., _Bharata Yudha_, the\r\n  conflict of the Bharatas), an epic poem dealing with the struggle\r\n  between the Pandåwås and the Koråwas for the throne of Ngastina\r\n  celebrated in parwas 5-10 of the _Mahabharata_. To the conception,\r\n  however, of the modern Javanese it is a purely native poem; its kings\r\n  and heroes find their place in the native history and serve as\r\n  ancestors to their noble families. (Cohen Stuart published the modern\r\n  Javanese version with a Dutch translation and notes, _Bråtå-Joedå_,\r\n  &c., Samarang, 1877. The Kavi text was lithographed at the Hague by S.\r\n  Lankhout.) Of greater antiquity probably is the _Ardjunå Wiwåhå_ (or\r\n  marriage festival of Ardjuna), which Professor Kern thinks may be\r\n  assigned to the first half of the 11th century of the Christian era.\r\n  The name indicates its _Mahabharata_ origin. (Friederich published the\r\n  Kavi text from a Bali MS., and _Wiwåhå Djarwa en Bråtå Joedo Kawi_,\r\n  lithographed facsimiles of two palm-leaf MSS., Batavia, 1878. Djarwa\r\n  is the name of the poetic diction of modern Javanese.) The oldest poem\r\n  of which any trace is preserved is probably the mythological _Kåndå_\r\n  (i.e. tradition); the contents are to some extent known from the\r\n  modern Javanese version. In the literature of modern Javanese there\r\n  exists a great variety of so-called _babads_ or chronicles. It is\r\n  sufficient to mention the \"history\" of Baron Sakender, which appears\r\n  to give an account--often hardly recognizable--of the settlement of\r\n  Europeans in Java (Cohen Stuart published text and translation,\r\n  Batavia, 1851; J. Veth gives an analysis of the contents), and the\r\n  _Babad Tanah Djawi_ (the Hague, 1874, 1877), giving the history of the\r\n  island to 1647 of the Javanese era. Even more numerous are the\r\n  _wayangs_ or puppet-plays which usually take their subjects from the\r\n  Hindu legends or from those relating to the kingdoms of Majapahit and\r\n  Pajajaram (see e.g. H. C. Humme, _Abiåså, een Javaansche toneelstuk_,\r\n  the Hague, 1878). In these plays grotesque figures of gilded leather\r\n  are moved by the performer, who recites the appropriate speeches and,\r\n  as occasion demands, plays the part of chorus.\r\n\r\n  Several Javanese specimens are also known of the beast fable, which\r\n  plays so important a part in Sanskrit literature (W. Palmer van den\r\n  Broek, _Javaansche Vertellingen, bevattende de lotgevallen van een\r\n  kantjil, een reebok_, &c., the Hague, 1878). To the Hindu-Javanese\r\n  literature there naturally succeeded a Mahommedan-Javanese literature\r\n  consisting largely of translations or imitations of Arabic originals;\r\n  it comprises religious romances, moral exhortations and mystical\r\n  treatises in great variety.[14]\r\n\r\n  _Arts._--In mechanic arts the Javanese are in advance of the other\r\n  peoples of the archipelago. Of thirty different crafts practised among\r\n  them, the most important are those of the blacksmith or cutler, the\r\n  carpenter, the kris-sheath maker, the coppersmith, the goldsmith and\r\n  the potter. Their skill in the working of the metals is the more\r\n  noteworthy as they have to import the raw materials. The most esteemed\r\n  product of the blacksmith's skill is the kris; every man and boy above\r\n  the age of fourteen wears one at least as part of his ordinary dress,\r\n  and men of rank two and sometimes four. In the finishing and adornment\r\n  of the finer weapons no expense is spared; and ancient krises of good\r\n  workmanship sometimes fetch enormous prices. The Javanese gold and\r\n  silver work possesses considerable beauty, but there is nothing equal\r\n  to the filigree of Sumatra; the brass musical instruments are of\r\n  exceptional excellence. Both bricks and tiles are largely made, as\r\n  well as a coarse unglazed pottery similar to that of Hindustan; but\r\n  all the finer wares are imported from China. Cotton spinning, weaving\r\n  and dyeing are carried on for the most part as purely domestic\r\n  operations by the women. The usual mode of giving variety of colour is\r\n  by weaving in stripes with a succession of different coloured yarns,\r\n  but another mode is to cover with melted wax or damar the part of the\r\n  cloth not intended to receive the dye. This process is naturally a\r\n  slow one, and has to be repeated according to the number of colours\r\n  required. As a consequence the _battiks_, as the cloths thus treated\r\n  are called, are in request by the wealthier classes. For the most part\r\n  quiet colours are preferred. To the Javanese of the present day the\r\n  ancient buildings of the Hindu periods are the work of supernatural\r\n  power. Except when employed by his European master he seldom builds\r\n  anything more substantial than a bamboo or timber framework; but in\r\n  the details of such erections he exhibits both skill and taste. When\r\n  Europeans first came to the island they found native vessels of large\r\n  size well entitled to the name of ships; and, though ship-building\r\n  proper is now carried on only under the direction of Europeans,\r\n  boat-building is a very extensive native industry along the whole of\r\n  the north coast--the boats sometimes reaching a burden of 50 tons. The\r\n  only one of the higher arts which the Javanese have carried to any\r\n  degree of perfection is music; and in regard to the value of their\r\n  efforts in this direction Europeans differ greatly. The orchestra\r\n  (_gamelan_) consists of wind, string and percussion instruments, the\r\n  latter being in preponderancy to the other two. (Details of the\r\n  instruments will be found in Raffles' _Java_, and a description of a\r\n  performance in the _Tour du monde_, 1880.)\r\n\r\n  _Chief Towns and Places of Note._--The capital of Java and of the\r\n  Dutch East India possessions is Batavia (q.v.), pop. 115,567. At\r\n  Meester Cornelis (pop. 33,119), between 6 and 7 m. from Batavia on the\r\n  railway to Buitenzorg, the battle was fought in 1811 which placed Java\r\n  in the hands of the British. In the vicinity lies Depok, originally a\r\n  Christian settlement of freed slaves, but now with about 3000\r\n  Mahommedan inhabitants and only 500 Christians. The other chief towns,\r\n  from west to east through the island, are as follows: Serang (pop.\r\n  5600) bears the same relation to Bantam, about 6 m. distant, which New\r\n  Batavia bears to Old Batavia, its slight elevation of 100 ft. above\r\n  the sea making it fitter for European occupation. Anjer (Angerlor,\r\n  Anger) lies 96 m. from Batavia by rail on the coast at the narrowest\r\n  part of the Sunda Strait; formerly European vessels were wont to call\r\n  there for fresh provisions and water. Pandeglang (pop. 3644), 787 ft.\r\n  above sea-level, is known for its hot and cold sulphur springs. About\r\n  17 m. west of Batavia lies Tangerang (pop. 13,535), a busy place with\r\n  about 2800 or 3000 Chinese among its inhabitants. Buitenzorg (q.v.) is\r\n  the country-seat of the governor-general, and its botanic gardens are\r\n  famous. Krawang, formerly chief town of the residency of that\r\n  name--the least populous of all--has lost its importance since\r\n  Purwakerta (pop. 6862) was made the administrative centre. At Wanyasa\r\n  in the neighbourhood the first tea plantations were attempted on a\r\n  large scale.\r\n\r\n  The Preanger regencies--Bandung, Chanjur, Sukabumi, Sumedang, Garut\r\n  and Tasikmalaya--constitute the most important of all the residencies,\r\n  though owing to their lack of harbour on the south and the intractable\r\n  nature of much of their soil they have not shared in the prosperity\r\n  enjoyed by many other parts of the island. Bandung, the chief town\r\n  since 1864, lies 2300 ft. above sea-level, 109 m. south of Batavia by\r\n  rail; it is a well-built and flourishing place (pop. 28,965; Europeans\r\n  1522, Chinese 2650) with a handsome resident's house (1867), a large\r\n  mosque (1867), a school for the sons of native men of rank, the most\r\n  important quinine factory in the island, and a race-course where in\r\n  July a good opportunity is afforded of seeing both the life of\r\n  fashionable and official Java and the customs and costumes of the\r\n  common people. The district is famous for its waterfalls, one of the\r\n  most remarkable of which is where the Chi Tarum rushes through a\r\n  narrow gully to leap down from the Bandung plateau. In the\r\n  neighbourhood is the great military camp of Chimahi. Chanjur, formerly\r\n  the chief town, in spite of its loss of administrative position still\r\n  has a population of 13,599. From Sukabumi (pop. 12,112; 569\r\n  Europeans), a pleasant health resort among the hills at an altitude of\r\n  1965 ft., tourists are accustomed to visit Wijnkoopers Bay for the\r\n  sake of the picturesque shore scenery. Chichalengka became after 1870\r\n  one of the centres of the coffee industry. Sumedang has only 8013\r\n  inhabitants, having declined since the railway took away the highway\r\n  traffic: it is exceeded both by Garut (10,647) and by Tasikmalaya\r\n  (9196), but it is a beautiful place well known to sportsmen for its\r\n  proximity to the Rancha Ekek swamp, where great snipe-shooting matches\r\n  are held every year. For natural beauty few parts of Java can compare\r\n  with the plain of Tasikmalaya, itself remarkable, in a country of\r\n  trees, for its magnificent avenues. N.E. of the Preanger lies the\r\n  residency of Cheribon[15] (properly Chi Rebon, the shrimp river). The\r\n  chief town (pop. 24,564) is one of the most important places on the\r\n  north coast, though the unhealthiness of the site has caused Europeans\r\n  to settle at Tangkil, 2 m. distant. The church (1842), the regent's\r\n  residence, and the great prison are among the principal buildings;\r\n  there are also extensive salt warehouses. The native part of the town\r\n  is laid out more regularly than is usual, and the Chinese quarter\r\n  (pop. 3352) has the finest Chinese temple in Java. The palaces of the\r\n  old sultans of Cheribon are less extensive than those of Surakarta and\r\n  Jokjakarta. Though the harbour has to be kept open by constant\r\n  dredging the roadstead is good all the year round. A strange pleasure\r\n  palace of Sultan Supeh, often described by travellers, lies about 2 m.\r\n  off near Sunya Raja. Mundu, a village 4 m. south-east of Cheribon, is\r\n  remarkable as the only spot on the north coast of the island visited\r\n  by the ikan prut or belly-fish, a species about as large as a cod,\r\n  caught in thousands and salted by the local fishermen. Indramayu,\r\n  which lies on both banks of the Chi Manuk about 8 m. from the coast,\r\n  is mentioned under the name of Dermayo as a port for the rice of the\r\n  district and the coffee of the Preanger. The coffee trade is extinct\r\n  but the rice trade is more flourishing than ever, and the town has\r\n  13,400 inhabitants, of whom 2200 are Chinese. It might have a great\r\n  commercial future if money could be found for the works necessary to\r\n  overcome the disadvantage of its position--the roads being safe only\r\n  during the east monsoon and the river requiring to be deepened and\r\n  regulated. Tegal has long been one of the chief towns of Java:\r\n  commerce, native trade and industry, and fisheries are all well\r\n  represented and the sugar factories give abundant employment to the\r\n  inhabitants. The harbour has been the object of various improvements\r\n  since 1871. The whole district is densely populated (3100 to the sq.\r\n  m.) and the town proper with its 16,665 inhabitants is surrounded by\r\n  extensive kampongs (Balapulang, Lebaksiu, &c.). In Pekalongan (pop.\r\n  38,211) and Batang (21,286) the most important industry is the\r\n  production of battiks and stamped cloths; there are also iron-works\r\n  and sugar factories. The two towns are only some 5 m. apart. The\r\n  former has a large mosque, a Protestant church, an old fort and a\r\n  large number of European houses. The Chinese quarters consist of neat\r\n  stone or brick buildings. Pekalongan smoked ducks are well known.\r\n  Brebes (13,474) on the Pamali is an important trade centre. Banyumas\r\n  (5000) is the seat of a resident; it is exceeded by Purwokerto\r\n  (12,610), Purbalinggo (12,094) and Chilachap (12,000). This last\r\n  possesses the best harbour on the south coast, and but for malaria\r\n  would have been an important place. It was chosen as the seat of a\r\n  great military establishment but had to be abandoned, the fort being\r\n  blown up in 1893. Semarang (pop. 89,286, of whom 4800 are Europeans\r\n  and 12,372 Chinese) lies on the Kali Ngaran near the centre of the\r\n  north coast. Up to 1824 the old European town was surrounded by a wall\r\n  and ditch. It was almost the exact reproduction of a Dutch town\r\n  without the slightest accommodation to the exigencies of the climate,\r\n  the streets narrow and irregular. The modern town is well laid out.\r\n  Among the more noteworthy buildings of Semarang are the old Prince of\r\n  Orange fort, the resident's house, the Roman Catholic church, the\r\n  Protestant church, the mosque, the military hospital. A new impulse to\r\n  the growth of the town was given by the opening of the railway to\r\n  Surakarta and Jokjakarta in 1875. As a seaport the place is\r\n  unfortunately situated. The river has long been silted up; the\r\n  roadstead is insecure in the west monsoon. After many delays an\r\n  artificial canal, begun in 1858, became available as a substitute for\r\n  the river; but further works are necessary. A second great canal to\r\n  the east, begun in 1896, helps to prevent inundations and thus improve\r\n  the healthiness of the town. Demak, 13 m. N.E. of Semarang, though\r\n  situated in a wretched region of swamps and having only 5000\r\n  inhabitants, is famous in ancient Javanese history. The mosque,\r\n  erected by the first sultan of Demak, was rebuilt in 1845; only a\r\n  small part of the old structure has been preserved, but as a sanctuary\r\n  it attracts 6000 or 7000 pilgrims annually. To visit Demak seven times\r\n  has the same ceremonial value as the pilgrimage to Mecca. The tombs of\r\n  several of the sultans are still extant. Salatiga (\"three stones,\"\r\n  with allusion to three temples now destroyed) was in early times one\r\n  of the resting places of ambassadors proceeding to the court of\r\n  Mataram, and in the European history of Java its name is associated\r\n  with the peace of 1755 and the capitulation of 1811. It is the seat of\r\n  a cavalry and artillery camp. Its population, about 10,000, seems to\r\n  be declining. Ambarawa with its railway station is, on the other hand,\r\n  rapidly increasing. Its population of 14,745 includes 459 Europeans.\r\n  About a mile to the N. lies the fortress of Willem I. which Van den\r\n  Bosch meant to make the centre of the Javanese system of defensive\r\n  works; the Banyubiru military camp is in the neighbourhood. Kendal\r\n  (15,000) is a centre of the sugar industry. Kudus (31,000; 4300\r\n  Chinese) has grown to be one of the most important inland towns. Its\r\n  cloth and battik pedlars are known throughout the island and the\r\n  success of their enterprise is evident in the style of their houses. A\r\n  good trade is also carried on in cattle, kapok, copra, pottery and all\r\n  sorts of small wares. The mosque in the old town has interesting\r\n  remains of Majapahit architecture; and the tomb of Pangeran Kudus is a\r\n  noted Mahommedan sanctuary. A steam tramway leads northward towards,\r\n  but does not reach Japara, which in the 17th century was the chief\r\n  port of the kingdom of Mataram and retained its commercial importance\r\n  till the Dutch Company removed its establishment to Semarang. In 1818\r\n  Daendels transferred its resident to Pati. Ungaran, 1026 ft. above the\r\n  sea, was a place of importance as early as the 17th century, and in\r\n  modern times has become known as a sanatorium. Rembang, a well-built\r\n  coast town and the seat of a resident, has grown rapidly to have a\r\n  population of 29,538 with 210 Europeans. Very similar to each other\r\n  are Surakarta or Solo and Jokjakarta, the chief towns of the\r\n  quasi-independent states or Vorstenlanden. Surakarta (pop. 109,459;\r\n  Chinese 5159, Europeans 1913) contains the palace (Kraton, locally\r\n  called the Bata bumi) of the susuhunan (which the Dutch translated as\r\n  emperor), the dalem of Prince Mangku Negårå, the residences of the\r\n  Solo nobles, a small Dutch fort (Vastenburg), a great mosque, an old\r\n  Dutch settlement, and a Protestant church. Here the susuhunan lives in\r\n  Oriental pomp and state. To visitors there are few more interesting\r\n  entertainments than those afforded by the celebration of the 31st of\r\n  August (the birthday of the queen of the Netherlands) or of the New\r\n  Year and the Puasa festivals, with their wayungs, ballet-dancers, and\r\n  so on. Jokjakarta (35 m. S.) has been a great city since Mangku Bumi\r\n  settled there in 1755. The Kraton has a circuit of 3½ m., and is a\r\n  little town in itself with the palace proper, the residences of the\r\n  ladies of the court and kampongs for the hereditary smiths,\r\n  carpenters, sculptors, masons, payong-makers, musical instrument\r\n  makers, &c., &c., of his highness. The independent Prince Paku Alam\r\n  has a palace of his own. As in Surakarta there are an old Dutch town\r\n  and a fort. The Jogka market is one of the most important of all Java,\r\n  especially for jewelry. The total population is 72,235 with 1424\r\n  Europeans. To the south-east lies Pasar Gedeh, a former capital of\r\n  Mataram, with tombs of the ancient princes in the Kraton, a favourite\r\n  residence of wealthy Javanese traders. Surabaya (q.v.), on the strait\r\n  of Madura, is the largest commercial town in Java. Its population\r\n  increased from 118,000 in 1890 to 146,944 in 1900 (8906 Europeans). To\r\n  the north lies Grissee or Gresih (25,688 inhabitants) with a fairly\r\n  good harbour and of special interest in the early European history of\r\n  Java. Inland is the considerable town of Lamongan (12,485\r\n  inhabitants). Fifteen m. S. by rail lies Sidoarjo (10,207; 185\r\n  Europeans), the centre of one of the most densely populated districts\r\n  and important as a railway junction. In the neighbourhood is the\r\n  populous village of Mojosari. Pasuruan was until modern times one of\r\n  the chief commercial towns in Java, the staple being sugar. Since the\r\n  opening of the railway to Surabaya it has greatly declined, and its\r\n  warehouses and dwelling-houses are largely deserted. The population is\r\n  27,152 with 663 Europeans. Probolinggo (called by the natives Banger)\r\n  is a place of 13,240 inhabitants. The swampy tracts in the vicinity\r\n  are full of fishponds. The baths of Banyubiru (blue water) to the\r\n  south have Hindu remains much visited by devotees. Pasirian in the far\r\n  south of the residency is a considerable market town and the terminus\r\n  of a branch railway. Besuki, the easternmost of all the residencies,\r\n  contains several places of some importance; the chief town Bondowoso\r\n  (8289); Besuki, about the same size, but with no foreign trade;\r\n  Jember, a small but rapidly increasing place, and Banyuwangi (17,559).\r\n  This last was at one time the seat of the resident, now the eastern\r\n  terminus of the railway system, and is a seaport on the Bali Strait\r\n  with an important office of the telegraph company controlling\r\n  communication with Port Darwin and Singapore. It has a very mingled\r\n  population, besides Javanese and Madurese, Chinese and Arabs,\r\n  Balinese, Buginese and Europeans. The chief town of Kediri (10,489) is\r\n  the only residency town in the interior traversed by a navigable\r\n  river, and is exceeded by Tulungagung; and the residency of Madiun has\r\n  two considerable centres of population: Madiun (21,168) and Ponorogo\r\n  (16,765).\r\n\r\n  _Agriculture._--About 40% of the soil of Java is under cultivation.\r\n  Bantam and Besuki have each 16% of land under cultivation; Krawang,\r\n  21%; Preanger, 23%; Rembang, 30%; Japara, 62%; Surabaya, 65%; Kedu,\r\n  66%; Samarang, 67%. Proceeding along the south coast from its west\r\n  end, we find that in Bantam all the land cultivated on its south shore\r\n  amounts to at most but 5% of that regency; in Preanger and Banyumas,\r\n  as far as Chilachap, the land under cultivation amounts at a maximum\r\n  to 20%. East of Surakarta the percentages of land on the south coast\r\n  under cultivation decline from 30 to 20 and 10. East of the residency\r\n  of Probolinggo the percentage of land cultivated on the south coast\r\n  sinks to as low as 2. On the north coast, in Krawang and Rembang, with\r\n  their morasses and double chains of chalk, there are districts with\r\n  only 20% and 10% of the soil under cultivation. In the residencies, on\r\n  the other hand, of Batavia, Cheribon, Tegal, Samarang, Japara,\r\n  Surabaya and Pasuruan, there are districts having 80% to 90% of soil,\r\n  and even more, under cultivation.\r\n\r\n  The agricultural products of Java must be distinguished into those\r\n  raised by the natives for their own use and those raised for the\r\n  government and private proprietors. The land assigned to the natives\r\n  for their own culture and use amounts to about 9,625,000 acres. In\r\n  western Java the prevailing crop is rice, less prominently cultivated\r\n  in middle Java, while in eastern Java and Madura other articles of\r\n  food take the first rank. The Javanese tell strange legends concerning\r\n  the introduction of rice, and observe various ceremonies in connexion\r\n  with its planting, paying more regard to them than to the proper\r\n  cultivation of the cereal. The agricultural produce grown on the lands\r\n  of the government and private proprietors, comprising an area of about\r\n  3½ million acres, consists of sugar, cinchona, coffee, tobacco, tea,\r\n  indigo, &c. The Javanese possess buffaloes, ordinary cattle, horses,\r\n  dogs and cats. The buffalo was probably introduced by the Hindus. As\r\n  in agricultural products, so also in cattle-rearing, western Java is\r\n  distinguished from middle and eastern Java. The average distribution\r\n  of buffaloes is 106 per 1000 inhabitants, but it varies considerably\r\n  in different districts, being greatest in western Java. The fact that\r\n  rice is the prevailing culture in the west, while in eastern Java\r\n  other plants constitute the chief produce, explains the larger number\r\n  of buffaloes found in western Java, these animals being more in\r\n  requisition in the culture of rice. The ordinary cattle are of mixed\r\n  race; the Indian zebu having been crossed with the banting and with\r\n  European cattle of miscellaneous origin. The horses, though small, are\r\n  of excellent character, and their masters, according to their own\r\n  ideas, are extremely particular in regard to purity of race. Riding\r\n  comes naturally to the Javanese; horse-races and tournays have been in\r\n  vogue among them from early times.\r\n\r\n  Coffee is an alien in Java. Specimens brought in 1696 from Cannanore\r\n  on the Malabar coast perished in an earthquake and floods in 1699; the\r\n  effective introduction of the precious shrub was due to Hendrik\r\n  Zwaardekron (see N. P. van den Berg, \"Voortbrenging en verbruck van\r\n  koffie,\" _Tijdschrift v. Nijverh. en Landb._ 1879; and the article\r\n  \"Koffie\" in _Encyc. Ned. Ind._ Wiji kawih is mentioned in a Kavi\r\n  inscription of A.D. 856, and the bean-broth in David Tappen's list of\r\n  Javanese beverages, 1667-1682, may have been coffee). The first\r\n  consignment of coffee (894 lb.) to the Netherlands was made in\r\n  1711-1712, but it was not till after 1721 that the yearly exports\r\n  reached any considerable amount. The aggregate quantity sold in the\r\n  home market from 1711 to 1791 was 2,036,437 piculs, or on an average\r\n  about 143 tons per annum; and this probably represented nearly the\r\n  whole production of the island. By the beginning of the 19th century\r\n  the annual production was about 7143 tons and after the introduction\r\n  of the Van den Bosch system of forced culture a further augmentation\r\n  was effected. The forced culture system was, in 1909, however, of\r\n  little importance. Official reports show that from 1840 to 1873 the\r\n  amount ranged from 5226 tons to 7354. During the ten years 1869 to\r\n  1878 the average crop of the plantations under state control was 5226\r\n  tons, that of the private planters about 810. The government has shown\r\n  a strange reluctance to surrender the old-fashioned monopoly, but the\r\n  spirit of private enterprise has slowly gained the day. Though the\r\n  appearance of the coffee blight (_Hemileia vastatrix_) almost ruined\r\n  the industry the planters did not give in. An immune variety was\r\n  introduced from Liberia, and scientific methods of treatment have been\r\n  adopted in dealing with the plantations. In 1887, a record year, the\r\n  value of the coffee crop reached £3,083,333, and at its average it was\r\n  about £1,750,000 between 1886 and 1895. The value was only £1,166,666\r\n  in 1896. The greatest difficulties are the uncertainties both of the\r\n  crop and of its marketable value. The former is well shown in the\r\n  figures for 1903 to 1905; government 17,900, 3949 and 3511 tons, and\r\n  private planters 22,395, 15,311 and 21,395 tons. Liberia coffee is\r\n  still produced in much smaller quantity than Java coffee; the latter\r\n  on an average of these three years 21,360 tons; the former 7409.\r\n\r\n  The cultivation of sugar has been long carried on in Java, and since\r\n  the decline of the coffee plantations it has developed into the\r\n  leading industry of the island. There are experimental stations at\r\n  Pasuruan, Pekalongan and elsewhere, where attempts are made to\r\n  overcome the many diseases to which the cane is subject. Many of the\r\n  mills are equipped with high-class machinery and produce sugar of\r\n  excellent colour and grain. In 1853-1857 the average crop was 98,094\r\n  tons; in 1869-1873, 170,831, and in 1875-1880, 204,678. By 1899-1900\r\n  the average had risen to 787,673 tons; and the crops for 1904 and 1905\r\n  were respectively 1,064,935 and 1,028,357 tons. Prices fluctuate, but\r\n  the value of the harvest of 1905 was estimated at about £15,000,000.\r\n\r\n  The cultivation of indigo shows a strange vitality. Under the culture\r\n  system the natives found this the most oppressive of all the state\r\n  crops. The modern chemist at one time seemed to have killed the\r\n  industry by his synthetic substitute, but in every year between 1899\r\n  and 1904 Java exported between one million and one and a half million\r\n  pounds of the natural product. Japan and Russia were the largest\r\n  buyers. As blue is a favourite colour with the Javanese proper a large\r\n  quantity is used at home.\r\n\r\n  Tea was first introduced to Java by the Japanese scholar von Siebold\r\n  in 1826. The culture was undertaken by the state in 1829 with plants\r\n  from China, but in 1842 they handed it over to contractors, whose\r\n  attempts to increase their profits by delivering an inferior article\r\n  ultimately led to the abandonment of the contract system in 1860. In\r\n  the meantime the basis of a better state of the industry had been laid\r\n  by the Dutch tea-taster J. J. L. L. Jacobsen of the Nederlandsch\r\n  Handel Maatschappij, who introduced not only fresh stock, but expert\r\n  growers from China in 1852-1853. The tea-planters (often taking\r\n  possession of the abandoned coffee-plantations) have greatly improved\r\n  the quality of their products. Assam tea was introduced in 1878, and\r\n  this has rapidly extended its area. The exports increased from\r\n  12,110,724 lb. in 1898 to 25,772,564 in 1905. More than half the total\r\n  goes to the Netherlands; the United Kingdom ranks next, and, far\r\n  behind both, Russia.\r\n\r\n  In 1854 the government introduced the culture of cinchona with free\r\n  labour, and it had considerable success under F. Junghuhn and his\r\n  successors, though the varieties grown were of inferior quality. Later\r\n  seed of the best cinchona was obtained, and under skilful management\r\n  Java has become the chief producer of quinine in the world. Cacao is\r\n  produced in the Preanger regencies, Pekalongan, Semarang, Pasuruan,\r\n  Besuki, Kediri and Surakarta. In 1903, a record year, 1,101,835 piculs\r\n  (about 6540 tons) were produced. _Broussonetia papyrifera_ is grown\r\n  for the sake of its bark, so well known in Japan (Jap. _kodsu_) as a\r\n  paper material. The ground-nut (the widely spread _Arachis hypogaea_\r\n  from South America), locally known as kachang china or tanah, is\r\n  somewhat extensively grown. The oil is exported to Holland, where it\r\n  is sold as Delft salad oil. Tapioca has long been cultivated,\r\n  especially in the Preanger. The industry is mainly in the hands of the\r\n  Chinese, and the principal foreign purchasers are English biscuit\r\n  manufacturers. The kapok is a tree from tropical America which,\r\n  growing freely in any soil, is extensively used throughout Java along\r\n  the highways as a support for telegraph and telephone wires, and\r\n  planted as a prop in pepper and cubeb plantations. The silky fibre\r\n  contained in its long capsuloid fruits is known as cotton wool; and\r\n  among other uses it serves almost as well as cork for filling\r\n  life-belts; and the oil from its seed is employed to adulterate\r\n  ground-nut oil. The quantity of wool exported nearly trebled between\r\n  1890 and 1896, in the latter year the total sent to Holland,\r\n  Australia, Singapore, &c., amounting to 38,586 bales. The rapid\r\n  exhaustion of the natural supply of india-rubber and gutta-percha\r\n  began to attract the attention of government in the latter decades of\r\n  the 19th century. Extensive experiments have been made in the\r\n  cultivation of _Ficus elastica_ (the karet of the natives), _Castilloa\r\n  elastica_, and _Hevea brasiliensis_. The planting of gutta-percha\r\n  trees was begun about 1886, and a regular system introduced in the\r\n  Preanger in 1901. The _Palaquium oblongifolium_ plantations at Blavan,\r\n  Kemutuk and Sewang in Banyumas have also been brought under official\r\n  control. Java tobacco, amounting to about 35,200,000 lb. a year, is\r\n  cultivated almost exclusively in eastern Java. Among other products\r\n  which are of some importance as articles of export may be mentioned\r\n  nutmegs, mace, pepper, hides, arrack and copra.\r\n\r\n  _Particular Lands._--At different times down to 1830 the government\r\n  disposed of its lands in full property to individuals who, acquiring\r\n  complete control of the inhabitants as well as of the soil, continued\r\n  down to the 19th century to act as if they were independent of all\r\n  superior authority. In this way more than 1½ millions of the people\r\n  were subject not to the state but to \"stock companies, absentee\r\n  landlords and Chinese.\" According to the _Regeerings Almanak_ (1906)\r\n  these \"particular lands,\" as they are called, were distributed as\r\n  follows: Bantam 21, Batavia 36, Meester Cornelis 163, Tangerang 80,\r\n  Buitenzorg 61, Semarang 32, Surabaya 46, Krawang and Demak 3 each,\r\n  Cheribon 2, and Pekalongan, Kendal and Pasuruan 1 each. In Meester\r\n  Cornelis no fewer than 297,912 persons were returned in 1905 as living\r\n  on these lands. Of the 168 estates there are not 20 that grow anything\r\n  but grass, rice and coconuts. In Buitenzorg (thanks probably to the\r\n  Botanic Gardens) matters are better: tea, coffee, cinchona and\r\n  india-rubber appearing amongst the objects of cultivation; and, in\r\n  general, it must be noted that these estates have often natural\r\n  difficulties to contend against far beyond their financial strength.\r\n\r\n  _Minerals._--Of all the great islands of the archipelago Java is the\r\n  poorest in metallic ores. Gold and silver are practically nonexistent.\r\n  Manganese is found in Jokjakarta and various other parts. A concession\r\n  for working the magnetic iron sands in the neighbourhood of Chilachap\r\n  was granted in 1904. Coal occurs in thin strata and small pockets in\r\n  many parts (Bantam, Rembang, Jokjakarta, &c.); and in 1905 a\r\n  concession was granted to a company to work the coal-beds at Bajah\r\n  close to the harbour of Wijnkoopers Bay, a port of call of the\r\n  Koninklijk Paketvaart Maatschappij. The discovery by De Groot in 1863\r\n  of petroleum added a most important industry to the list of the\r\n  resources of Java. The great Dort Petroleum Company, now centred at\r\n  Amsterdam, was founded in 1887. The production of this company alone\r\n  rose from 79,179 _kisten_ or cases (each 8.14 gall.) in 1891 to\r\n  1,642,780 in 1890, and to 1,967,124 in 1905. In 1904 there were no\r\n  fewer than 36 concessions for petroleum. At the same time there is a\r\n  larger importation of oil from Sumatra as well as from America and\r\n  Russia. Sulphur is regularly worked in the Gunong Slamet, G. Sindoro,\r\n  G. Sumbing, and in the crater of the Tangkuban Prahu as well as in\r\n  other places in the Preanger regencies and in Pasuruan. Brine-wells\r\n  exist in various parts. The bledegs (salt-mud wells) of Grobogan in\r\n  the Solo Valley, Semarang, are best known. They rise from Miocene\r\n  strata and yield iodine and bromine products as well as common salt.\r\n  The natives of the district are allowed to extract the salt for their\r\n  own use, but elsewhere (except in Jokjakarta) the manufacture of salt\r\n  is a government monopoly and confined to the districts of Sumenep,\r\n  Panekasan and Sampang in Madura, where from 3000 to 4000 people are\r\n  hereditarily engaged in extracting salt from sea water, delivering it\r\n  to the government at the rate of 10 fl. (nearly 17s.) per koyang (3700\r\n  lb.). The distribution of this salt (rough-grained, greyish and highly\r\n  hygroscopic) is extremely unsatisfactory. The waste was so great that\r\n  in 1901 the government paid a prize of about £835 (10,000 fl.) to Karl\r\n  Boltz von Bolzberg for an improved method of packing. Between 1888 and\r\n  1892 the annual amount delivered was 71,405 tons; in the next five\r\n  years it rose to 89,932; and between 1898 and 1902 sank again to\r\n  88,856. The evil effects of this monopoly have been investigated by J.\r\n  E. de Meyer, \"Zout als middel van belasting,\" _De Ind. Gids._ (1905).\r\n  The scarcity of salt has led to a great importation of salted fish\r\n  from Siam (upwards of 6600 tons in 1902).\r\n\r\n  _Communications._--Roads and railways for the most part follow the\r\n  fertile plains and table-lands along the coast and between the\r\n  volcanic areas. The principal railways are the Semarang-Jokjakarta and\r\n  Batavia-Buitenzorg lines of the Netherlands-Indian railway company,\r\n  and the Surabaya-Pasuruan, Bangil-Mulang, Sidoarjo-Paron,\r\n  Kertosono-Tulung Agung, Buitenzorg-Chianjur, Surakarta-Madiun,\r\n  Pasuruan-Probolinggo, Jokjakarta-Chilachap and other lines of the\r\n  government. The earliest lines, between Batavia and Buitenzorg and\r\n  between Semarang and the capitals of the sultanates, were built about\r\n  1870 by a private company with a state guarantee. Since 1875, when Dr\r\n  van Goltstein, then a cabinet minister and afterwards Dutch minister\r\n  in London, had an act passed for the construction of state railways in\r\n  Java, their progress has become much more rapid. In addition, several\r\n  private companies have built either light railways or tramways, such\r\n  as that between Semarang and Joana, and the total length of all lines\r\n  was 2460 in 1905. There are some 3500 miles of telegraph line, and\r\n  cables connect Java with Madura, Bali and Sumatra, and Port Darwin in\r\n  Australia. Material welfare was promoted by the establishment of lines\r\n  of steamships between Java and the other islands, all belonging to a\r\n  Royal Packet Company, established in 1888 under a special statute, and\r\n  virtually possessing a monopoly on account of the government mail\r\n  contracts.\r\n\r\n  _Administration._--Each village (dessa) forms an independent\r\n  community, a group of dessas forms a district, a group of districts a\r\n  department and a group of departments a residency, of which there are\r\n  seventeen. At the head of each residency is a resident, with an\r\n  assistant resident and a controller, all Dutch officials. The\r\n  officials of the departments and districts are natives appointed by\r\n  the government; those of the dessa are also natives, elected by the\r\n  inhabitants and approved by the resident. In the two sultanates of\r\n  Surakarta and Jokjakarta the native sultans govern under the\r\n  supervision of the residents. (For the colonial administration of\r\n  Netherlands India see MALAY ARCHIPELAGO.)\r\n\r\n_History._--The origin of the name Java is very doubtful. It is not\r\nimprobable that it was first applied either to Sumatra or to what was\r\nknown of the Indian Archipelago--the insular character of the several\r\nparts not being at once recognized. Jawa Dwipa, or \"land of millet,\" may\r\nhave been the original form and have given rise both to the Jaba diu of\r\nPtolemy and to the Je-pho-thi of Fahien, the Chinese pilgrim of the\r\n4th-5th century. The oldest form of the name in Arabic is apparently\r\nZábej. The first epigraphic occurrence of Jawa is in an inscription of\r\n1343. In Marco Polo the name is the common appellation of all the Sunda\r\nislands. The Jawa of Ibn Batuta is Sumatra; Java is his Mul Jáwa (i.e.\r\npossibly \"original Java\"). Jåwå is the modern Javanese name (in the\r\ncourt speech Jawi), sometimes with Nusa, \"island,\" or Tanah, \"country,\"\r\nprefixed.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to extract a rational historical narrative from the\r\nearlier _babads_ or native chronicles, and even the later are destitute\r\nof any satisfactory chronology. The first great era in the history is\r\nthe ascendancy of the Hindus, and that breaks up into three periods--a\r\nperiod of Buddhism, a period of aggressive Sivaism, and a period of\r\napparent compromise. Of the various Hindu states that were established\r\nin the island, that of Majapahit was the most widely dominant down to\r\nthe end of the 15th century; its tributaries were many, and it even\r\nextended its sway into other parts of the archipelago. The second era of\r\nJavanese history is the invasion of Islam in the beginning of the 15th\r\ncentury; and the third is the establishment of European and more\r\nparticularly of Dutch influence and authority in the island. About 1520\r\nthe Portuguese entered into commercial relationship with the natives,\r\nbut at the close of the same century the Dutch began to establish\r\nthemselves. At the time when the Dutch East India company began to fix\r\nits trading factories on the coast towns, the chief native state was\r\nMataram, which had in the 16th century succeeded to the overlordship\r\npossessed by the house of Demak--one of the states that rose after the\r\nfall of Majapahit. The emperors of Java, as the princes of Mataram are\r\ncalled in the early accounts, had their capital at Kartasura, now an\r\nalmost deserted place, 6 m. west of Surakarta. At first and for long the\r\ncompany had only forts and little fragments of territory at Jakatra\r\n(Batavia), &c.; but in 1705 it obtained definite possession of the\r\nPreanger by treaty with Mataram; and in 1745 its authority was extended\r\nover the whole north-east coast, from Cheribon to Banyuwangi. In 1755\r\nthe kingdom of Mataram was divided into the two states of Surakarta and\r\nJokjakarta, which still retain a shadow of independence. The kingdom of\r\nBantam was finally subjugated in 1808. By the English occupation of the\r\nisland (1811-1818) the European ascendancy was rather strengthened than\r\nweakened; the great Java war (1825-1830), in which Dipå Negårå, the last\r\nJavanese prince, a clever, bold and unscrupulous leader, struggled to\r\nmaintain his claim to the whole island, resulted in the complete success\r\nof the Dutch. To subdue him and his following, however, taxed all the\r\nresources of the Dutch Indian army for a period of five years, and cost\r\nit the loss of 15,000 officers and soldiers, besides millions of\r\nguilders. Nor did his great influence die with him when his adventurous\r\ncareer came to a close in 1855 at Macassar. Many Javanese, who dream of\r\na restoration of their ancient empire, do not believe even yet that Dipå\r\nNegårå is dead. They are readily persuaded by fanatical hadjis that\r\ntheir hero will suddenly appear to drive away the Dutch and claim his\r\nrightful heritage. Several times there have been political troubles in\r\nthe native states of central Java, in which Dipå Negårå's name was used,\r\nnotably in 1883, when many rebellious chieftains were exiled. Similar\r\nattempts at revolt had been made before, mainly in 1865 and 1870, but\r\nnone so serious perhaps as that in 1849, in which a son and a brother of\r\nDipå Negårå were implicated, aiming to deliver and reinstate him. All\r\nsuch attempts proved as futile there as others in different parts of\r\nJava, especially in Bantam, where the trouble of 1850 and 1888 had a\r\nreligious origin, and in the end they directly contributed to the\r\nconsolidation of Dutch sway. Being the principal Dutch colony in the\r\nMalay Archipelago, Java was the first to benefit from the material\r\nchange which resulted from the introduction of the Grondwet or\r\nFundamental Law of 1848 in Holland. The main changes were of an\r\neconomical character, but the political developments were also\r\nimportant. Since 1850 Dutch authority has steadily advanced, principally\r\nat the expense of the semi-independent sultanates in central Java, which\r\nhad been allowed to remain after the capture and exile of Dipå Negårå.\r\nThe power of the sultans of Jokjakarta and Surakarta has diminished; in\r\n1863 Dutch authority was strengthened in the neighbouring island of\r\nMadura, and Bantam has lost every vestige of independence. The\r\nstrengthening of the Dutch power has largely resulted from a more\r\nstatesmanlike and more generous treatment of the natives, who have been\r\neducated to regard the _orang blanda_, or white man, as their protector\r\nagainst the native rulers. Thus, in 1866, passports for natives\r\ntravelling in Java were abolished by the then governor-general, Dr Sloet\r\nvan de Beele, who also introduced many reforms, reducing the _corvée_ in\r\nthe government plantations to a minimum, and doing away with the\r\nmonopoly of fisheries. Six years later a primary education system for\r\nthe natives, and a penal code, whose liberal provisions seemed framed\r\nfor Europeans, were introduced.\r\n\r\n  _Antiquities._--Ordinary traces of early human occupation are few in\r\n  Java. The native bamboo buildings speedily perish. Stone weapons are\r\n  occasionally found. But remains of the temples and monastic buildings\r\n  of the Hindu period are numerous and splendid, and are remarkable as\r\n  representing architecture which reached a high standard without the\r\n  use of mortar, supporting columns or arches. Chandis (i.e. temples,\r\n  though the word originally meant a depository for the ashes of a\r\n  saint) are not found in western Java. They exist in two great zones:\r\n  one in middle Java, one in eastern Java, each with its own\r\n  distinguishing characteristics, both architectural and religious. The\r\n  former begins in the Dyeng plateau, in the east of Banyumas, and\r\n  extends into the east of Bagelen, Kedu and the neighbouring districts\r\n  of Semarang, northern Jokjakarta, and the western corner of Surakarta.\r\n  The latter lies mainly in Surabaya, Kediri and Pasuruan. A\r\n  considerable number of ruins also exist in Probolinggo. Farther east\r\n  they grow scarce. There is none in Madura. The remains of Macham Putih\r\n  in Banyuwangi are possibly of non-Hindu origin. In the regency of\r\n  Kendal (Semarang), to the north of Kedu, the place-names show that\r\n  temples once existed.[16] Some of them are Sivaite, some Buddhist,\r\n  some astoundingly composite. None of the Buddhist buildings shows\r\n  traces of the older Himaryana form of the creed. The greatest of all\r\n  is a perfect sculptural exposition of the Mahayana doctrine. As to the\r\n  period during which these temples were erected, authorities are not\r\n  agreed. Ijzerman assigns the central Java groups to between the 8th\r\n  and the 10th centuries. The seven-storeyed vihara (monastery)\r\n  mentioned in the famous Menang-Kabu inscription (Sumatra) as founded\r\n  by Maharaja Dhiraya Adityadharma in A.D. 656 is by some supposed to be\r\n  Boro-Budur. A copper plate of 840 refers to Dyeng (Dehyang) as one of\r\n  the sacred mountains of Java. One thing seems certain, that the\r\n  temples of the eastern zone are of much more recent origin than most,\r\n  at least, of the central zone. They are generally distinguished by the\r\n  characteristics of a decadent and more voluptuous age, and show that\r\n  the art of the time had become less Indian and more Javanese, with\r\n  traces of influences derived from the more eastern East. At the same\r\n  time it must be noted that even in Boro Budur there are non-Indian\r\n  elements in the decoration, indicating that the Hindu architect\r\n  employed native artists and to some extent left them a free hand.\r\n\r\n  In his standard work on _Indian and Eastern Architecture_ (London,\r\n  1876), James Fergusson asserted that the Javanese temples are in the\r\n  Chalukyan style. But J. W. Ijzerman in an elaborate paper in the\r\n  _Album-Kern_ contends that the learned historian of architecture was\r\n  misled by basing his opinion mainly on inaccurate drawings reproduced\r\n  by Raffles. The Javanese temples, with the solitary exception of\r\n  Chandi Bima in the Dyeng, are Dravidian and not Chalukyan. The very\r\n  temples quoted by Fergusson, when more carefully examined, disprove\r\n  his statement: a fact not without its bearing on the history of the\r\n  Hindu immigration.\r\n\r\n  The wonderful scenery of the Dyeng plateau was already, in all\r\n  probability, an object of superstitious awe to the aboriginal\r\n  inhabitants of Java; and thus it would catch the attention of the\r\n  earliest Hindu settlers. The old crater floor is full of traces of\r\n  human occupation; though, in spite of the tradition of the existence\r\n  of a considerable town, no sepulchral relics of the inhabitants have\r\n  been discovered. There still remain five groups of temples--some well\r\n  preserved, some mere heaps of stone--to prove the devotion their\r\n  builders bore to Siva, his consort Durga, and Ganesha their son. The\r\n  Arjuno group, in the middle of the plateau, consists of Chandi Arjuno\r\n  (with its chapel or priests' residence, Ch. Semar), Ch. Srikahdi, Ch.\r\n  Puntadeva and Ch. Sembadro, each a simple square chamber with a\r\n  portico reached by a flight of steps. The second group, Ch. Daravati\r\n  and Ch. Parakesit, lies to the north-east. The third, now a ruined\r\n  mound, lies to the east. The fourth, to the north-west, is a group of\r\n  seven small temples of which Ch. Sanchaki is the most important, with\r\n  a square ground plan and an octagon roof with a second circular\r\n  storey. Of the fifth group, in the south, only one temple remains--the\r\n  Chandi Bima--a small, beautiful and exceptionally interesting\r\n  building, in \"the form of a pyramid, the ribs of which stand out much\r\n  more prominently than the horizontal lines of the niche-shaped\r\n  ornaments which rest each on its lotus cushion.\" How this happens to\r\n  be the one Chalukyan temple amid hundreds is a problem to be solved.\r\n  The plateau lies 6500 ft. above the sea, and roads and stairways,\r\n  locally known as Buddha roads, lead up from the lowlands of Bagelen\r\n  and Pekalongan. The stairway between Lake Menjur and Lake Chebong\r\n  alone consisted of 4700 steps. The width of the roadway, however, is\r\n  only some three or four feet. A remarkable subterranean tunnel still\r\n  exists, which served to drain the plateau.\r\n\r\n  Of all the Hindu temples of Java the largest and most magnificent is\r\n  Boro-Budur, which ranks among the architectural marvels of the world.\r\n  It lies in the residency of Kedu, a little to the west of the Progo, a\r\n  considerable stream flowing south to the Indian Ocean. The place is\r\n  best reached by taking the steam-tram from Magelang or Jokjakarta to\r\n  the village of Muntilam Passar, where a conveyance may be hired.\r\n  Strictly speaking, Boro-Budur is not a temple but a hill, rising about\r\n  150 ft. above the plain, encased with imposing terraces constructed of\r\n  hewn lava-blocks and crowded with sculptures. The lowest terrace now\r\n  above ground forms a square, each side 497 ft. long. About 50 ft.\r\n  higher there is another terrace of similar shape. Then follow four\r\n  other terraces of more irregular contour. The structure is crowned by\r\n  a dome or cupola 52 ft. in diameter surrounded by sixteen smaller\r\n  bell-shaped cupolas. Regarded as a whole, the main design, to quote Mr\r\n  Sewell, may be described as \"an archaic Indian temple, considerably\r\n  flattened and consisting of a series of terraces, surmounted by a\r\n  quasi-stupa capped by a dagoba.\" It was discovered by the engineer J.\r\n  W. Ijzerman in 1885 that the basement of the structure had been\r\n  earthed up before the building was finished, and that the lowest\r\n  retaining wall was completely concealed by the embankment. The\r\n  architects had evidently found that their temple was threatened with a\r\n  destructive subsidence; and, while the sculptors were still busy with\r\n  the decoration of the lower façades, they had to abandon their work.\r\n  But the unfinished bas-reliefs were carefully protected by clay and\r\n  blocks of stone and left in position; and since 1896 they are\r\n  gradually but systematically being exhumed and photographed by the\r\n  Dutch archaeologists, who, however, have to proceed with caution,\r\n  filling up one portion of the embankment before they go on to deal\r\n  with another. The subjects treated in this lowest enceinte are of the\r\n  most varied description, forming a picture-gallery of landscapes,\r\n  scenes of outdoor and domestic life, mingled with mythological and\r\n  religious designs. Among the genre class appear men shooting birds\r\n  with blow-pipe or bow and arrow, fishermen with rod or net, a man\r\n  playing a bagpipe, and so on. It would seem as if the architect had\r\n  intended gradually to wean the devotees from the things of this world.\r\n  When once they began to ascend from stage to stage of the temple-hill\r\n  they were introduced to the realities of religion; and by the time\r\n  they reached the dagoba they had passed through a process of\r\n  instruction and were ready, with enlightened eyes, to enter and behold\r\n  the image of Buddha, symbolically left imperfect, as beyond the power\r\n  of human art to realize or portray. From basement to summit the whole\r\n  hill is a great picture bible of the Mahayana creed.\r\n\r\n  If the statues and bas-reliefs of Boro-Budur were placed side by side\r\n  they would extend for 3 m. The eye of the spectator, looking up from\r\n  the present ground-level, is caught, says Mr Sewell, by the rows of\r\n  life-size Buddhas that adorn the retaining walls of the several\r\n  terraces and the cage-like shrines on the circular platforms. All the\r\n  great figures on the east side represent Akshobhya, the Dhyani Buddha\r\n  of the East. His right hand is in the Chumisparsa mudra (pose)\r\n  touching the earth in front of the right knee--\"I swear by the earth.\"\r\n  All the statues on the south side are Ratnasam Chavu in the varada\r\n  mudra--the right hand displayed upwards--\"I give you all.\" On the west\r\n  side the statues represent Amitabha in the dhyana or padinasama mudra,\r\n  the right hand resting palm upwards on the left, both being on the\r\n  lap--the attitude of meditation. Those on the north represent\r\n  Amogasiddhi in the abhaya mudra, the right hand being raised and\r\n  displayed, palm outwards--\"Fear not, all is well.\"\r\n\r\n  Other remarkable groups of Hindu temples exist near the village of\r\n  Prambanan[17] (less correctly Brambanan) in Surakarta, but not far\r\n  from the borders of Jokjakarta, with a station on the railway between\r\n  the two chief towns. The village has been named after the temples,\r\n  Prambanan signifying the place of teachers. The whole ecclesiastical\r\n  settlement was surrounded by three lines of wall, of which only the\r\n  inmost is now visible above ground. Between the second and third walls\r\n  are 157 small temples, and in the central enclosure are the ruins of\r\n  six larger temples in a double row with two smaller ones at the side.\r\n  The middle temple of the western row is the main building, full of\r\n  statues of purely Sivaite character--Siva as Guru or teacher, Siva as\r\n  Kala or Time the Destroyer, Durga, Ganesha, and so on. But, just as\r\n  many churches in Christendom are called not after the Christ but after\r\n  the Virgin, so this is known as Lara (i.e. Virgin) Janggrang from the\r\n  popular name of Durga. In the southern temple of the row is a very\r\n  fine figure of a four-armed Brahma; in the northern there was a Vishnu\r\n  with attendant figures. Of the other row the middle temple is again\r\n  the largest, with Siva, his nandi or bull, and other symbolic\r\n  sculptures. To the north lies the extraordinary cluster of temples\r\n  which, though it does not deserve its popular name of Chandi Sewu, the\r\n  thousand shrines, consists of at least 240 small buildings gathered\r\n  round a great central temple, richly adorned, though roofless and\r\n  partially ruined since the earthquake of 1867. Among the more\r\n  noteworthy figures are those of the huge and ungainly guardians of the\r\n  temple kneeling at the four main gateways of each of the principal\r\n  buildings. Colonel Yule pointed out that there are distinct traces of\r\n  a fine coat of stucco on the exterior and the interior of the\r\n  buildings, and he compared in this respect \"the cave walls of Ellora,\r\n  the great idols at Bamian, and the Doric order at Selinus.\" Other\r\n  temples in the same neighbourhood as Chandi Sewu are Ch. Lumbung, Ch.\r\n  Kali Bening (Baneng), with a monstrous Kala head as the centre of the\r\n  design on the southern side, Ch. Kalong and Ch. Plaosan. Tradition\r\n  assigns these temples to 1266-1296.\r\n\r\n  Of the temples of the eastern zone the best known is Chandi Jago (or\r\n  Tumpang), elaborately described in the Archaeological Commission's\r\n  monograph. According to the _Pararaton_, a native chronicle (published\r\n  in the _Verhand. v. h. Bat. Gen. v. K. en W._, 1896), it belongs to\r\n  the 13th century, containing the tomb of Rangavuni or Vishnuvardhana,\r\n  who died in 1272-1273. The shrine proper occupies the third of three\r\n  platforms, the lowest of which forms a square of 45 to 46 ft. each\r\n  side. The building fronts the west, and is constructed of an andesitic\r\n  tuff of inferior quality and dark colour. Of distinctly Buddhistic\r\n  influence there is no trace. The makara (elephant-fish head) is\r\n  notably absent. The sculptures which run round the base and along the\r\n  sides of the platforms or terraces are of the most elaborate and\r\n  varied description--kings on thrones, dwarfs, elephants, supernatural\r\n  beings, diabolical and grotesque, tree-monsters, palaces, temples,\r\n  courtyards, lakes, gardens, forests--all are represented. In one place\r\n  appears a Chinese--or Burmese-looking seven-roofed pagoda; in another,\r\n  a tall temple strangely split down the centre, with a flight of steps\r\n  running up the fissure. The inscriptions are in the Devanagari\r\n  character. In the same neighbourhood are Ch. Singossari, Ch. Kidal,\r\n  &c. Another of the most beautiful of the eastern temples is Ch.\r\n  Jabung, mentioned in 1330. It is built of red brick; and its\r\n  distinctly Javanese origin is suggested by the frequency of the\r\n  snake-motif still characteristic of modern Javanese art. It may be\r\n  added that a comparison of the several buildings of the zone affords\r\n  an interesting study in the development of the pilaster as a\r\n  decorative rather than structural element.\r\n\r\n  At Panabaram, near Blitar, Kediri, is another group of stone temples\r\n  and other buildings. The chief temple is remarkable for the richness\r\n  of its sculptures, which are peculiarly delicate and spirited in their\r\n  details. The decoration of the mere robes of one of the free-standing\r\n  stairway-guardians consists of scroll-work, interspersed with birds\r\n  and animals rendered in a non-Indian style, reminiscent of Chinese or\r\n  Japanese work. It has been described as one of the most beautiful\r\n  pieces of sculpture in all the East.\r\n\r\n  Sculptures from the temples are scattered far and wide throughout\r\n  Java, and it is one of the greatest difficulties of the archaeologist\r\n  to determine the origin of many of the most interesting specimens.\r\n  This, too, is often the case with those that have found their way to\r\n  the museums of Java and Europe (Batavia, Leiden, Haarlem, Berlin,\r\n  &c.). Minor relics of the past are to be found alike in the palaces of\r\n  the nobles and the huts of the highland peasants. Zodiac cups of\r\n  copper or bronze dating from the 12th or 13th century are in daily use\r\n  among the Tenggerese. The musical instruments used by the musicians of\r\n  the native courts are often prized on account of their great\r\n  antiquity.\r\n\r\n  As many of the Chinese came from China centuries ago and have not\r\n  ceased to hold intercourse with their native country, the houses of\r\n  the wealthier men among them are often rich in ancient specimens of\r\n  Chinese art. The special exhibition organized by Henri Borel and other\r\n  enthusiasts showed how much of value in this matter might be brought\r\n  together in spite of the reluctance of the owners to commit the\r\n  sacrilege of exposing to public gaze the images of their ancestral\r\n  gods and heroes. Borel has given exquisite examples of images of\r\n  Kwan-yin (the Chinese Virgin-Goddess), of Buddhas, of the ghoulish god\r\n  of literature, of Lie-tai-Peh (the Chinese poet who has gone to live\r\n  in the planet Venus), &c., in illustration of his papers in _L'Art\r\n  flamand et hollandais_, pt. v. (1900), a translation of his monograph\r\n  published at Batavia.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Besides the special works quoted _passim_, see Sir\r\n  Stamford Raffles, _History of Java_ (London, 1830); F.

Javelin-throwing is one of the contests in the athletic section\r\nat the international Olympic games. Formerly the sheriff of a county or\r\nborough had a body of men armed with javelins, and known as javelin-men,\r\nwho acted as a bodyguard for the judges when they went on assize. Their\r\nduties are now performed by the ordinary police. The word itself is an\r\nadaptation of Fr. _javeline_. There are several words in Celtic and\r\nScandinavian languages and in Old English, meaning a spear or dart, that\r\nseem to be connected with _javel_, the base form in French; thus Welsh\r\n_gaflach_, Irish _gabhla_, O. Norwegian _gaflok_, O. E. _gafeluc_, later\r\nin the form _gavelock_, cf. O. Norman-Fr. _gavelot_, _javelot_, Ital.\r\n_giavelotto_. The origin seems to be Celtic, and the word is cognate\r\nwith Ir. _gafa_, a hook, fork, gaff; the root is seen in \"gable\" (q.v.),\r\nand in the German _Gabel_, fork. The change in meaning from fork, forked\r\nend of a spear, to the spear itself is obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAW (Mid. Eng. _jawe_, _jowe_ and _geowe_, O. Eng. _cheowan_, connected\r\nwith \"chaw\" and \"chew,\" and in form with \"jowl\"), in anatomy, the term\r\nfor the upper maxillary bone, and the mandible or lower maxillary bone\r\nof the skull; it is sometimes loosely applied to all the lower front\r\nparts of the skull (q.v.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAWALIQI, ABU MANSUR MAUHUB UL-JAWALIQI (1073-1145), Arabian grammarian,\r\nwas born at Bagdad, where he studied philology under Tibrizi and became\r\nfamous for his handwriting. In his later years he acted as imam to the\r\ncaliph Moqtafi. His chief work is the _Kitab ul-Mu'arrab_, or\r\n\"Explanation of Foreign Words used in Arabic.\"\r\n\r\n  The text was edited from an incomplete manuscript by E. Sachau\r\n  (Leipzig, 1867). Many of the lacunae in this have been supplied from\r\n  another manuscript by W. Spitta in the _Journal of the German Oriental\r\n  Society_, xxxiii. 208 sqq. Another work, written as a supplement to\r\n  the _Durrat ul-Ghawwas_ of Hariri (q.v.), has been published as \"Le\r\n  Livre des locutions vicieuses,\" by H.

The estimated revenue is £11,000; there is no\r\ntribute. The chief, who is a Koli by caste, traces back his descent to\r\n1343. The leading exports are teak and rice. The principal village is\r\nthat of Jawhar (pop. 3567).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAWORÓW, a town in Galicia, Austria, 30 m. W. of Lemberg. Pop. (1900),\r\n10,090. It has a pottery, a brewery, a distillery and some trade in\r\nagricultural produce. Not far from it is the watering-place of Szkto\r\nwith sulphur springs. The town was a favourite residence of John\r\nSobieski, who there received the congratulations of the pope and the\r\nVenetian republic on his success against the Turks at Vienna (1683). At\r\nJaworów Peter the Great was betrothed to Catherine I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAY, JOHN (1745-1829), American statesman, the descendant of a Huguenot\r\nfamily, and son of Peter Jay, a successful New York merchant, was born\r\nin New York City on the 12th of December 1745. On graduating at King's\r\nCollege (now Columbia University) in 1764, Jay entered the office of\r\nBenjamin Kissam, an eminent New York lawyer. In 1768 he was admitted to\r\nthe bar, and rapidly acquired a lucrative practice. In 1774 he married\r\nSarah, youngest daughter of William Livingston, and was thus brought\r\ninto close relations with one of the most influential families in New\r\nYork. Like many other able young lawyers, Jay took an active part in the\r\nproceedings that resulted in the independence of the United States,\r\nidentifying himself with the conservative element in the Whig or patriot\r\nparty. He was sent as a delegate from New York City to the Continental\r\nCongress at Philadelphia in September 1774, and though almost the\r\nyoungest member, was entrusted with drawing up the address to the people\r\nof Great Britain. Of the second congress, also, which met at\r\nPhiladelphia on the 10th of May 1775, Jay was a member; and on its\r\nbehalf he prepared an address to the people of Canada and an address to\r\nthe people of Jamaica and Ireland. In April 1776, while still retaining\r\nhis seat in the Continental Congress, Jay was chosen as a member of the\r\nthird provincial congress of New York; and his consequent absence from\r\nPhiladelphia deprived him of the honour of affixing his signature to the\r\nDeclaration of Independence. As a member of the fourth provincial\r\ncongress he drafted a resolution by which the delegates of New York in\r\nthe Continental Congress were authorized to sign the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. In 1777 he was chairman of the committee of the convention\r\nwhich drafted the first New York state constitution. After acting for\r\nsome time as one of the council of safety (which administered the state\r\ngovernment until the new constitution came into effect), he was made\r\nchief justice of New York state, in September 1777. A clause in the\r\nstate constitution prohibited any justice of the Supreme Court from\r\nholding any other post save that of delegate to Congress on a \"special\r\noccasion,\" but in November 1778 the legislature pronounced the\r\nsecession of what is now the state of Vermont from the jurisdiction of\r\nNew Hampshire and New York to be such an occasion, and sent Jay to\r\nCongress charged with the duty of securing a settlement of the\r\nterritorial claims of his state. He took his seat in congress on the 7th\r\nof December, and on the 10th was chosen president in succession to Henry\r\nLaurens.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of September 1779 Jay was appointed minister plenipotentiary\r\nto negotiate a treaty between Spain and the United States. He was\r\ninstructed to endeavour to bring Spain into the treaty already existing\r\nbetween France and the United States by a guarantee that Spain should\r\nhave the Floridas in case of a successful issue of the war against Great\r\nBritain, reserving, however, to the United States the free navigation of\r\nthe Mississippi. He was also to solicit a subsidy in consideration of\r\nthe guarantee, and a loan of five million dollars. His task was one of\r\nextreme difficulty. Although Spain had joined France in the war against\r\nGreat Britain, she feared to imperil her own colonial interests by\r\ndirectly encouraging and aiding the former British colonies in their\r\nrevolt against their mother country, and she had refused to recognize\r\nthe United States as an independent power. Jay landed at Cadiz on the\r\n22nd of January 1780, but was told that he could not be received in a\r\nformally diplomatic character. In May the king's minister, Count de\r\nFlorida Bianca, intimated to him that the one obstacle to a treaty was\r\nthe question of the free navigation of the Mississippi, and for months\r\nfollowing this interview the policy of the court was clearly one of\r\ndelay. In February 1781 Congress instructed Jay that he might make\r\nconcessions regarding the navigation of the Mississippi, if necessary;\r\nbut further delays were interposed, the news of the surrender of\r\nYorktown arrived, and Jay decided that any sacrifice to obtain a treaty\r\nwas no longer advisable. His efforts to procure a loan were not much\r\nmore successful, and he was seriously embarrassed by the action of\r\nCongress in drawing bills upon him for large sums. Although by\r\nimportuning the Spanish minister, and by pledging his personal\r\nresponsibility, Jay was able to meet some of the bills, he was at last\r\nforced to protest others; and the credit of the United States was saved\r\nonly by a timely subsidy from France.\r\n\r\nIn 1781 Jay was commissioned to act with Franklin, John Adams, Jefferson\r\nand Henry Laurens in negotiating a peace with Great Britain. He arrived\r\nin Paris on the 23rd of June 1782, and jointly with Franklin had\r\nproceeded far with the negotiations when Adams arrived late in October.\r\nThe instructions of the American negotiators were as follows:--\r\n\r\n  \"You are to make the most candid and confidential communications upon\r\n  all subjects to the ministers of our generous ally, the king of\r\n  France; to undertake nothing in the negotiations for peace or truce\r\n  without their knowledge and concurrence; and ultimately to govern\r\n  yourselves by their advice and opinion, endeavouring in your whole\r\n  conduct to make them sensible how much we rely on his majesty's\r\n  influence for effectual support in every thing that may be necessary\r\n  to the present security, or future prosperity, of the United States of\r\n  America.\"\r\n\r\nJay, however, in a letter written to the president of Congress from\r\nSpain, had expressed in strong terms his disapproval of such dependence\r\nupon France, and, on arriving in Paris, he demanded that Great Britain\r\nshould treat with his country on an equal footing by first recognizing\r\nits independence, although the French minister, Count de Vergennes,\r\ncontended that an acknowledgment of independence as an effect of the\r\ntreaty was as much as could reasonably be expected. Finally, owing\r\nlargely to Jay, who suspected the good faith of France, the American\r\nnegotiators decided to treat independently with Great Britain. The\r\nprovisional articles, which were so favourable to the United States as\r\nto be a great surprise to the courts of France and Spain, were signed on\r\nthe 30th of November 1782, and were adopted with no important change as\r\nthe final treaty on the 3rd of September 1783.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of July 1784 Jay landed in New York, where he was presented\r\nwith the freedom of the city and elected a delegate to Congress. On the\r\n7th of May Congress had already chosen him to be secretary for foreign\r\naffairs, and in December Jay resigned his seat in Congress and accepted\r\nthe secretaryship. He continued to act in this capacity until 1790, when\r\nJefferson became secretary of state under the new constitution. In the\r\nquestion of this constitution Jay had taken a keen interest, and as an\r\nadvocate of its ratification he wrote over the name \"Publius,\" five\r\n(Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 64) of the famous series of papers known\r\ncollectively as the _Federalist_ (see HAMILTON, ALEXANDER). He published\r\nanonymously (though without succeeding in concealing the authorship) _An\r\nAddress to the People of New York_, in vindication of the constitution;\r\nand in the state convention at Poughkeepsie he ably seconded Hamilton in\r\nsecuring its ratification by New York. In making his first appointments\r\nto federal offices President Washington asked Jay to take his choice;\r\nJay chose that of chief justice of the Supreme Court, and held this\r\nposition from September 1789 to June 1795. The most famous case that\r\ncame before him was that of _Chisolm_ v. _Georgia_, in which the\r\nquestion was, Can a state be sued by a citizen of another state? Georgia\r\nargued that it could not be so sued, on the ground that it was a\r\nsovereign state, but Jay decided against Georgia, on the ground that\r\nsovereignty in America resided with the people. This decision led to the\r\nadoption of the eleventh amendment to the federal constitution, which\r\nprovides that no suit may be brought in the federal courts against any\r\nstate by a citizen of another state or by a citizen or subject of any\r\nforeign state. In 1792 Jay consented to stand for the governorship of\r\nNew York State, but a partisan returning-board found the returns of\r\nthree counties technically defective, and though Jay had received an\r\nactual majority of votes, his opponent, George Clinton, was declared\r\nelected.\r\n\r\nEver since the War of Independence there had been friction between Great\r\nBritain and the United States. To the grievances of the United States,\r\nconsisting principally of Great Britain's refusal to withdraw its troops\r\nfrom the forts on the north-western frontier, as was required by the\r\npeace treaty of 1783, her refusal to make compensation for negroes\r\ncarried away by the British army at the close of the War of Independence,\r\nher restrictions on American commerce, and her refusal to enter into any\r\ncommercial treaty with the United States, were added, after war broke out\r\nbetween France and Great Britain in 1793, the anti-neutral naval policy\r\naccording to which British naval vessels were authorized to search\r\nAmerican merchantmen and impress American seamen, provisions were treated\r\nas contraband of war, and American vessels were seized for no other\r\nreason than that they had on board goods which were the property of the\r\nenemy or were bound for a port which though not actually blockaded was\r\ndeclared to be blockaded. The anti-British feeling in the House of\r\nRepresentatives became so strong that on the 7th of April 1794 a\r\nresolution was introduced to prohibit commercial intercourse between the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain until the north-western posts should be\r\nevacuated and Great Britain's anti-neutral naval policy should be\r\nabandoned. Thereupon Washington, fearing that war might result, appointed\r\nJay minister extraordinary to Great Britain to negotiate a new treaty,\r\nand the Senate confirmed the appointment by a vote of 18 to 8, although\r\nthe non-intercourse resolution which came from the house a few days later\r\nwas defeated in the senate only by the casting vote of Vice-President\r\nJohn Adams. Jay landed at Falmouth in June 1794, signed a treaty with\r\nLord Grenville on the 19th of November, and disembarked again at New York\r\non the 28th of May 1795. The treaty, known in history as Jay's Treaty,\r\nprovided that the north-western posts should be evacuated by the 1st of\r\nJune 1796, that commissioners should be appointed to settle the\r\nnorth-east and the north-west boundaries, and that the British claims for\r\nBritish debts as well as the American claims for compensation for illegal\r\nseizures should be referred to commissioners. More than one-half of the\r\nclauses in the treaty related to commerce, and although they contained\r\nrather small concessions to the United States, they were about as much as\r\ncould reasonably have been expected in the circumstances. One clause, the\r\noperation of which was limited to two years from the close of the\r\nexisting war, provided that American vessels not exceeding 70 tons burden\r\nmight trade with the West Indies, but should carry only American\r\nproducts there and take away to American ports only West Indian products;\r\nmoreover, the United States was to export in American vessels no\r\nmolasses, sugar, coffee, cocoa or cotton to any part of the world. Jay\r\nconsented to this prohibition under the impression that the articles\r\nnamed were peculiarly the products of the West Indies, not being aware\r\nthat cotton was rapidly becoming an important export from the southern\r\nstates. The operation of the other commercial clauses was limited to\r\ntwelve years. By them the United States was granted limited privileges of\r\ntrade with the British East Indies; some provisions were made for\r\nreciprocal freedom of trade between the United States and the British\r\ndominions in Europe; some articles were specified under the head of\r\n\"contraband of war\"; it was agreed that whenever provisions were seized\r\nas contraband they should be paid for, and that in cases of the capture\r\nof a vessel carrying contraband goods such goods only and not the whole\r\ncargo should be seized; it was also agreed that no vessel should be\r\nseized merely because it was bound for a blockaded port, unless it\r\nattempted to enter the port after receiving notice of the blockade. The\r\ntreaty was laid before the Senate on the 8th of June 1795, and, with the\r\nexception of the clause relating to trade with the West Indies, was\r\nratified on the 24th by a vote of 20 to 10. As yet the public was\r\nignorant of its contents, and although the Senate had enjoined secrecy on\r\nits members even after the treaty had been ratified, Senator Mason of\r\nVirginia gave out a copy for publication only a few days later. The\r\nRepublican party, strongly sympathizing with France and strongly\r\ndisliking Great Britain, had been opposed to Jay's mission, and had\r\ndenounced Jay as a traitor and guillotined him in effigy when they heard\r\nthat he was actually negotiating. The publication of the treaty only\r\nadded to their fury. They filled newspapers with articles denouncing it,\r\nwrote virulent pamphlets against it, and burned Jay in effigy. The\r\nBritish flag was insulted. Hamilton was stoned at a public meeting in New\r\nYork while speaking in defence of the treaty, and Washington was grossly\r\nabused for signing it. In the House of Representatives the Republicans\r\nendeavoured to prevent the execution of the treaty by refusing the\r\nnecessary appropriations, and a vote (29th of April, 1795) on a\r\nresolution that it ought to be carried into effect stood 49 to 49; but on\r\nthe next day the opposition was defeated by a vote of 51 to 48. Once in\r\noperation, the treaty grew in favour. Two days before landing on his\r\nreturn from the English mission, Jay had been elected governor of New\r\nYork state; notwithstanding his temporary unpopularity, he was re-elected\r\nin April 1798. With the close of this second term of office in 1801, he\r\nended his public career. Although not yet fifty-seven years old, he\r\nrefused all offers of office and retiring to his estate near Bedford in\r\nWestchester county, N.Y., spent the rest of his life in rarely\r\ninterrupted seclusion. In politics he was throughout inclined toward\r\nConservatism, and after the rise of parties under the federal government\r\nhe stood with Alexander Hamilton and John Adams as one of the foremost\r\nleaders of the Federalist party, as opposed to the Republicans or\r\nDemocratic-Republicans. From 1821 until 1828 he was president of the\r\nAmerican Bible Society. He died on the 17th of May 1829. The purity and\r\nintegrity of his life are commemorated in a sentence by Daniel Webster:\r\n\"When the spotless ermine of the judicial robe fell on John Jay, it\r\ntouched nothing less spotless than itself.\"\r\n\r\n  See _The Correspondence and Public Papers of John Jay_ (4 vols., New\r\n  York, 1890-1893), edited by H.

He was actively interested in peace, temperance and\r\nanti-slavery movements. He took a prominent part in 1816 in founding\r\nthe American Bible Society; was a judge of Westchester county from 1818\r\nto 1843, when he was removed from office by the party in power in New\r\nYork, which hoped, by sacrificing an anti-slavery judge, to gain\r\nadditional strength in the southern states; joined the American\r\nanti-slavery society in 1834, and held several important offices in this\r\norganization. In 1840, however, when it began to advocate measures which\r\nhe deemed too radical, he withdrew his membership, but with his pen he\r\ncontinued his labours on behalf of the slave, urging emancipation in the\r\ndistrict of Columbia and the exclusion of slavery from the Territories,\r\nthough deprecating any attempt to interfere with slavery in the states.\r\nHe was a member of the American peace society and was its president for\r\nseveral years. His pamphlet, _War and Peace: the Evils of the First with\r\na Plan for Securing the Last_, advocating international arbitration, was\r\npublished by the English Peace Society in 1842, and is said to have\r\ncontributed to the promulgation, by the powers signing the Treaty of\r\nParis in 1856, of a protocol expressing the wish that nations, before\r\nresorting to arms, should have recourse to the good offices of a\r\nfriendly power. Among William Jay's other writings, the most important\r\nare _The Life of John Jay_ (2 vols., 1833) and a _Review of the Causes\r\nand Consequences of the Mexican War_ (1849). He died at Bedford on the\r\n14th of October 1858.\r\n\r\n  See Bayard Tuckerman, _William Jay and the Constitutional Movement for\r\n  the Abolition of Slavery_ (New York, 1893).\r\n\r\nWilliam Jay's son, JOHN JAY (1817-1894), also took an active part in the\r\nanti-slavery movement. He was a prominent member of the free soil party,\r\nand was one of the organizers of the Republican party in New York. He\r\nwas United States minister to Austria-Hungary in 1869-1875, and was a\r\nmember, and for a time president, of the New York civil service\r\ncommission appointed by Governor Cleveland in 1883.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAY, WILLIAM (1769-1853), English Nonconformist divine, was born at\r\nTisbury in Wiltshire on the 6th of May 1769. He adopted his father's\r\ntrade of stone-mason, but gave it up in 1785 in order to enter the Rev.\r\nCornelius Winter's school at Marlborough. During the three years that\r\nJay spent there, his preaching powers were rapidly developed. Before he\r\nwas twenty-one he had preached nearly a thousand times, and in 1788 he\r\nhad for a while occupied Rowland Hill's pulpit in London. Wishing to\r\ncontinue his reading he accepted the humble pastorate of Christian\r\nMalford, near Chippenham, where he remained about two years. After one\r\nyear at Hope chapel, Clifton, he was called to the ministry of Argyle\r\nIndependent chapel in Bath; and on the 30th of January 1791 he began the\r\nwork of his life there, attracting hearers of every religious\r\ndenomination and of every rank, and winning for himself a wide\r\nreputation as a brilliant pulpit orator, an earnest religious author,\r\nand a friendly counsellor. Sheridan declared him to be the most manly\r\norator he had ever heard. A long and honourable connexion of sixty-two\r\nyears came to an end in January 1853, and he died on the 27th of\r\nDecember following.\r\n\r\n  The best-known of Jay's works are his _Morning and Evening Exercises_:\r\n  _The Christian contemplated_: _The Domestic Minister's Assistant_; and\r\n  his _Discourses_. He also wrote a _Life of Rev. Cornelius Winter_, and\r\n  _Memoirs of Rev. John Clarke_. An edition of Jay's _Works_ in 12\r\n  vols., 8vo, revised by himself, was issued in 1842-1844, and again in\r\n  1856. A new edition, in 8 vols., 8vo, was published in 1876. See\r\n  _Autobiography_ (1854); S. Wilson's _Memoir of Jay_ (1854); S. Newth\r\n  in _Pulpit Memorials_ (1878).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAY (Fr. _géai_), a well-known and very beautiful European bird, the\r\n_Corvus glandarius_ of Linnaeus, the _Garrulus glandarius_ of modern\r\nornithologists. To this species are more or less closely allied numerous\r\nbirds inhabiting the Palaearctic and Indian regions, as well as the\r\ngreater part of America, but not occurring in the Antilles, in the\r\nsouthern portion of the Neotropical Region, or in the Ethiopian or\r\nAustralian. All these birds are commonly called jays, and form a group\r\nof the crows or _Corvidae_, which may fairly be considered a sub-family,\r\n_Garrulinae_. Indeed there are, or have been, systematists who would\r\nelevate the jays to the rank of a family _Garrulidae_--a proceeding\r\nwhich seems unnecessary. Some of them have an unquestionable\r\nresemblance to the pies, if the group now known by that name can be\r\nsatisfactorily severed from the true _Corvinae_. In structure the jays\r\nare not readily differentiated from the pies; but in habit they are much\r\nmore arboreal, delighting in thick coverts, seldom appearing in the\r\nopen, and seeking their food on or under trees. They seem also never to\r\nwalk or run when on the ground, but always to hop. The body-feathers are\r\ncommonly loose and soft; and, gaily coloured as are most of the species,\r\nin few of them has the plumage the metallic glossiness it generally\r\npresents in the pies, while the proverbial beauty of the \"jay's wing\" is\r\ndue to the vivid tints of blue--turquoise and cobalt, heightened by bars\r\nof jet-black, an indication of the same style of ornament being\r\nobservable in the greater number of the other forms of the group, and in\r\nsome predominating over nearly the whole surface. Of the many genera\r\nthat have been proposed by ornithologists, perhaps about nine may be\r\ndeemed sufficiently well established.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1--European Jay.]\r\n\r\nThe ordinary European jay, _Garrulus glandarius_ (fig. 1), has suffered\r\nso much persecution in the British Islands as to have become in many\r\ndistricts a rare bird. In Ireland it seems now to be indigenous to the\r\nsouthern half of the island only; in England generally, it is far less\r\nnumerous than formerly; and in Scotland its numbers have decreased with\r\nstill greater rapidity. There is little doubt that it would have been\r\nexterminated but for its stock being supplied in autumn by immigration,\r\nand for its shy and wary behaviour, especially at the breeding-season,\r\nwhen it becomes almost wholly mute, and thereby often escapes detection.\r\nNo truthful man, however much he may love the bird, will gainsay the\r\ndepredations on fruit and eggs that it at times commits; but the\r\ngardeners and gamekeepers of Britain, instead of taking a few simple\r\nsteps to guard their charge from injury, deliberately adopt methods of\r\nwholesale destruction--methods that in the case of this species are only\r\ntoo easy and too effectual--by proffering temptation to trespass which\r\nit is not in jay-nature to resist, and accordingly the bird runs great\r\nchance of total extirpation. Notwithstanding the war carried on against\r\nthe jay, its varied cries and active gesticulations show it to be a\r\nsprightly bird, and at a distance that renders its beauty-spots\r\ninvisible, it is yet rendered conspicuous by its cinnamon-coloured body\r\nand pure white tail-coverts, which contrast with the deep black and rich\r\nchestnut that otherwise mark its plumage, and even the young at once\r\nassume a dress closely resembling that of the adult. The nest, generally\r\nconcealed in a leafy tree or bush, is carefully built, with a lining\r\nformed of fine roots neatly interwoven. Herein from four to seven eggs,\r\nof a greenish-white closely freckled, so as to seem suffused with light\r\nolive, are laid in March or April, and the young on quitting it\r\naccompany their parents for some weeks.\r\n\r\nThough the common jay of Europe inhabits nearly the whole of this\r\nquarter of the globe south of 64° N. lat., its territory in the east of\r\nRussia is also occupied by _G. brandti_, a kindred form, which replaces\r\nit on the other side of the Ural, and ranges thence across Siberia to\r\nJapan; and again on the lower Danube and thence to Constantinople the\r\nnearly allied _G. krynicki_ (which alone is found in southern Russia,\r\nCaucasia and Asia Minor) shares its haunts with it.[1] It also crosses\r\nthe Mediterranean to Algeria and Morocco; but there, as in southern\r\nSpain, it is probably but a winter immigrant. The three forms just named\r\nhave the widest range of any of the genus. Next to them come _G.\r\natricapillus_, reaching from Syria to Baluchistan, _G. japonicus_, the\r\nordinary jay of southern Japan, and _G. sinensis_, the Chinese bird.\r\nOther forms have a much more limited area, as _G. cervicalis_, the local\r\nand resident jay of Algeria, _G. hyrcanus_, found on the southern shores\r\nof the Caspian Sea, and _G. taevanus_, confined to the island of\r\nFormosa. The most aberrant of the true jays is _G. lidthi_, a very rare\r\nspecies, which seems to come from some part of Japan (_vide_ Salvadori,\r\n_Atti Accad. Torino_, vii. 474), though its exact locality is not known.\r\n\r\nLeaving the true jays of the genus _Garrulus_, it is expedient next to\r\nconsider those of a group named, in 1831, _Perisoreus_ by Prince C. L.\r\nBonaparte (_Saggio_, &c., _Anim. Vertebrati_, p. 43) and _Dysornithia_\r\nby Swainson (_F. B.-Americana_, ii. 495).[2]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--American Blue Jay.]\r\n\r\nThis group contains two species--one the Lanius infaustus of Linnaeus\r\nand the Siberian jay of English writers, which ranges throughout the\r\npine-forests of the north of Europe and Asia, and the second the _Corvus\r\ncanadensis_ of the same author, or Canada jay, occupying a similar\r\nstation in America. The so-called Siberian jay is one of the most\r\nentertaining birds in the world. Its versatile cries and actions, as\r\nseen and heard by those who penetrate the solitude of the northern\r\nforests it inhabits, can never be forgotten by one who has had\r\nexperience of them, any more than the pleasing sight of its\r\nrust-coloured tail, which an occasional gleam of sunshine will light up\r\ninto a brilliancy quite unexpected by those who have only surveyed the\r\nbird's otherwise gloomy appearance in the glass-case of a museum. It\r\nseems scarcely to know fear, obtruding itself on the notice of any\r\ntraveller who invades its haunts, and, should he halt, making itself at\r\nonce a denizen of his bivouac. In confinement it speedily becomes\r\nfriendly, but suitable food for it is not easily found. Linnaeus seems\r\nto have been under a misapprehension when he applied to it the trivial\r\nepithet it bears; for by none of his countrymen is it deemed an unlucky\r\nbird, but rather the reverse. In fact, no one can listen to the cheery\r\nsound of its ordinary calls with any but a hopeful feeling. The Canada\r\njay, or \"whisky-jack\" (the corruption probably of a Cree name), seems to\r\nbe of a similar nature, but it presents a still more sombre coloration,\r\nits nestling plumage,[3] indeed, being thoroughly corvine in appearance\r\nand suggestive of its being a pristine form.\r\n\r\nAs though to make amends for the dull plumage of the species last\r\nmentioned, North America offers some of the most brilliantly coloured\r\nof the sub-family, and the common blue jay[4] of Canada and the eastern\r\nstates of the Union, _Cyanurus cristatus_ (fig. 2), is one of the most\r\nconspicuous birds of the Transatlantic woods. The account of its habits\r\nby Alexander Wilson is known to every student of ornithology, and\r\nWilson's followers have had little to do but supplement his history with\r\nunimportant details. In this bird and its many allied forms, coloration,\r\nthough almost confined to various tints of blue, seems to reach its\r\nclimax, but want of space forbids more particular notice of them, or of\r\nthe members of the other genera _Cyanocitta_, _Cyanocorax_, _Xanthura_,\r\n_Psilorhinus_, and more, which inhabit various parts of the Western\r\ncontinent. It remains, however, to mention the genus Cissa, including\r\nmany beautiful forms belonging to the Indian region, and among them the\r\n_C. speciosa_ and _C. sinensis_, so often represented in Oriental\r\ndrawings, though doubts may be expressed whether these birds are not\r\nmore nearly related to the pies than to the jays.     (A. N.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] Further information will possibly show that these districts are\r\n    not occupied at the same season of the year by the two forms.\r\n\r\n  [2] Recent writers have preferred the former name, though it was only\r\n    used sub-generically by its author, who assigned to it no characters,\r\n    which the inventor of the latter was careful to do, regarding it at\r\n    the same time as a genus.\r\n\r\n  [3] In this it was described and figured (_F. B. Americana_, ii. 296,\r\n    pl. 55) as a distinct species, _G. brachyrhynchus_.\r\n\r\n  [4] The birds known as blue jays in India and Africa are rollers\r\n    (q.v.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEALOUSY (adapted from Fr. _jalousie_, formed from _jaloux_, jealous,\r\nLow Lat. _zelosus_, Gr. [Greek: zêlos], ardour, zeal, from the root seen\r\nin [Greek: zéein], to boil, ferment; cf. \"yeast\"), originally a\r\ncondition of zealous emulation, and hence, in the usual modern sense, of\r\nresentment at being (or believing that one is or may be) supplanted or\r\npreferred in the love or affection of another, or in the enjoyment of\r\nsome good regarded as properly one's own. Jealousy is really a form of\r\nenvy, but implies a feeling of personal claim which in envy or\r\ncovetousness is wanting. The jealousy of God, as in Exod. xx. 5, \"For I,\r\nthe Lord thy God, am a jealous God,\" has been defined by Pusey (_Minor\r\nProphets_, 1860) as the attribute \"whereby he does not endure the love\r\nof his creatures to be transferred from him.\" \"Jealous,\" by etymology,\r\nis however, only another form of \"zealous,\" and the identity is\r\nexemplified by such expressions as \"I have been very jealous for the\r\nLord God of Hosts\" (1 Kings xix. 10). A kind of glass, thick, ribbed and\r\nnon-transparent, was formerly known as \"jealous-glass,\" and this\r\napplication is seen in the borrowed French word _jalousie_, a blind or\r\nshutter, made of slats of wood, which slope in such a way as to admit\r\nair and a certain amount of light, while excluding rain and sun and\r\ninspection from without.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEAN D'ARRAS, a 15th-century _trouvère_, about whose personal history\r\nnothing is known, was the collaborator with Antoine du Val and Fouquart\r\nde Cambrai in the authorship of a collection of stories entitled\r\n_Évangiles de quenouille_. They purport to record the narratives of a\r\ngroup of ladies at their spinning, who relate the current theories on a\r\ngreat variety of subjects. The work dates from the middle of the 15th\r\ncentury and is of considerable value for the light it throws on medieval\r\nmanners.\r\n\r\n  There were many editions of this book in the 15th and 16th centuries,\r\n  one of which was printed by Wynkyn de Worde in English, as _The\r\n  Gospelles of Dystaves_. A modern edition (Collection Jannet) has a\r\n  preface by Anatole France.\r\n\r\nAnother _trouvère_, JEAN D'ARRAS who flourished in the second half of\r\nthe 14th century, wrote, at the request of John, duke of Berry, a long\r\nprose romance entitled _Chronique de la princesse_. It relates with many\r\ndigressions the antecedents and life of the fairy Mélusine (q.v.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEAN DE MEUN, or DE MEUNG (c. 1250-c. 1305), whose original name was\r\nJean Clopinel or Chopinel, was born at Meun-sur-Loire. Tradition asserts\r\nthat he studied at the university of Paris. At any rate he was, like his\r\ncontemporary, Rutebeuf, a defender of Guillaume de Saint-Amour and a\r\nbitter critic of the mendicant orders. Most of his life seems to have\r\nbeen spent in Paris, where he possessed, in the Rue Saint-Jacques, a\r\nhouse with a tower, court and garden, which was described in 1305 as the\r\nhouse of the late Jean de Meung, and was then bestowed by a certain Adam\r\nd'Andely on the Dominicans. Jean de Meun says that in his youth he\r\ncomposed songs that were sung in every public place and school in\r\nFrance. In the enumeration of his own works he places first his\r\ncontinuation of the _Roman de la rose_ of Guillaume de Lorris (q.v.).\r\nThe date of this second part is generally fixed between 1268 and 1285\r\nby a reference in the poem to the death of Manfred and Conradin,\r\nexecuted (1268) by order of Charles of Anjou (d. 1285) who is described\r\nas the present king of Sicily. M. F. Guillon (_Jean Clopinel_, 1903),\r\nhowever, considering the poem primarily as a political satire, places it\r\nin the last five years of the 13th century. Jean de Meun doubtless\r\nedited the work of his predecessor, Guillaume de Lorris, before using it\r\nas the starting-point of his own vast poem, running to 19,000 lines. The\r\ncontinuation of Jean de Meun is a satire on the monastic orders, on\r\ncelibacy, on the nobility, the papal see, the excessive pretensions of\r\nroyalty, and especially on women and marriage. Guillaume had been the\r\nservant of love, and the exponent of the laws of \"courtoisie\"; Jean de\r\nMeun added an \"art of love,\" exposing with brutality the vices of women,\r\ntheir arts of deception, and the means by which men may outwit them.\r\nJean de Meun embodied the mocking, sceptical spirit of the _fabliaux_.\r\nHe did not share in current superstitions, he had no respect for\r\nestablished institutions, and he scorned the conventions of feudalism\r\nand romance. His poem shows in the highest degree, in spite of the\r\nlooseness of its plan, the faculty of keen observation, of lucid\r\nreasoning and exposition, and it entitles him to be considered the\r\ngreatest of French medieval poets. He handled the French language with\r\nan ease and precision unknown to his predecessors, and the length of his\r\npoem was no bar to its popularity in the 13th and 14th centuries. Part\r\nof its vogue was no doubt due to the fact that the author, who had\r\nmastered practically all the scientific and literary knowledge of his\r\ncontemporaries in France, had found room in his poem for a great amount\r\nof useful information and for numerous citations from classical authors.\r\nThe book was attacked by Guillaume de Degulleville in his _Pèlerinage de\r\nla vie humaine_ (c. 1330), long a favourite work both in England and\r\nFrance; by John Gerson, and by Christine de Pisan in her _Épître au dieu\r\nd'amour_; but it also found energetic defenders.\r\n\r\n  Jean de Meun translated in 1284 the treatise, _De re militari_, of\r\n  Vegetius into French as _Le livre de Vegèce de l'art de chevalerie_[1]\r\n  (ed. Ulysse Robert, _Soc. des anciens textes fr._, 1897). He also\r\n  produced a spirited version, the first in French, of the letters of\r\n  Abelard and Hèloïse. A 14th-century MS. of this translation in the\r\n  Bibliothèque Nationale has annotations by Petrarch. His translation of\r\n  the _De consolatione philosophiae_ of Boëtius is preceded by a letter\r\n  to Philip IV. in which he enumerates his earlier works, two of which\r\n  are lost--_De spirituelle amitié_ from the _De spirituali amicitia_ of\r\n  Aelred of Rievaulx (d. 1166), and the _Livre des merveilles\r\n  d'Hirlande_ from the _Topographia Hibernica_, or _De Mirabilibus\r\n  Hiberniae_ of Giraldus Cambrensis (Giraud de Barry). His last poems\r\n  are doubtless his _Testament_ and _Codicille_. The _Testament_ is\r\n  written in quatrains in monorime, and contains advice to the different\r\n  classes of the community.\r\n\r\n  See also Paulin Paris in _Hist. lit. de la France_, xxviii. 391-439,\r\n  and E.

It is\r\nsupplied with natural gas and is primarily a manufacturing centre, its\r\nprincipal manufactures being glass, table-ware and rubber goods.\r\nJeannette was founded in 1888, and was incorporated as a borough in\r\n1889.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEANNIN, PIERRE (1540-1622), French statesman, was born at Autun. A\r\npupil of the great jurist Jacques Cujas at Bourges, he was an advocate\r\nat Dijon in 1569 and became councillor and then president of the\r\n_parlement_ of Burgundy. He opposed in vain the massacre of St\r\nBartholomew in his province. As councillor to the duke of Mayenne he\r\nsought to reconcile him with Henry IV. After the victory of\r\nFontaine-Française (1595), Henry took Jeannin into his council and in\r\n1602 named him intendant of finances. He took part in the principal\r\nevents of the reign, negotiated the treaty of Lyons with the duke of\r\nSavoy (see HENRY IV.), and the defensive alliance between France and\r\nthe United Netherlands in 1608. As superintendent of finances under\r\nLouis XIII., he tried to establish harmony between the king and the\r\nqueen-mother.\r\n\r\n  See Berger de Xivrey, _Lettres missives de Henri IV._ (in the\r\n  _Collection inédite pour l'histoire de France_), t. v.

He was a man of independent judgment and warmly\r\nsupported the movement of 1771 for abolishing university and clerical\r\nsubscription to the Thirty-nine Articles. In his lectures on the Greek\r\nTestament he is said to have expressed Socinian views. In 1775 he\r\nresigned his Suffolk church livings, and two years afterwards graduated\r\nM.D. at St Andrews. He practised medicine in London and was elected\r\nF.R.S. in 1779.\r\n\r\nAnother JOHN JEBB (1775-1833), bishop of Limerick, is best known as the\r\nauthor of _Sacred Literature_ (London, 1820).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEBB, SIR RICHARD CLAVERHOUSE (1841-1905), English classical scholar,\r\nwas born at Dundee on the 27th of August 1841. His father was a\r\nwell-known barrister, and his grandfather a judge. He was educated at\r\nCharterhouse and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He won the Porson and\r\nCraven scholarships, was senior classic in 1862, and became fellow and\r\ntutor of his college in 1863. From 1869 to 1875 he was public orator of\r\nthe university; professor of Greek at Glasgow from 1875 to 1889, and at\r\nCambridge from 1889 till his death on the 9th of December 1905. In 1891\r\nhe was elected member of parliament for Cambridge University; he was\r\nknighted in 1900. Jebb was acknowledged to be one of the most brilliant\r\nclassical scholars of his time, a humanist in the best sense, and his\r\npowers of translation from and into the classical languages were\r\nunrivalled. A collected volume, _Translations into Greek and Latin_,\r\nappeared in 1873 (ed. 1909). He was the recipient of many honorary\r\ndegrees from European and American universities, and in 1905 was made a\r\nmember of the Order of Merit. He married in 1874 the widow of General A.\r\nJ. Slemmer, of the United States army, who survived him.\r\n\r\n  Jebb was the author of numerous publications, of which the following\r\n  are the most important: The _Characters_ of Theophrastus (1870), text,\r\n  introduction, English translation and commentary (re-edited by J. E.\r\n  Sandys, 1909); _The Attic Orators from Antiphon to Isaeus_ (2nd ed.,\r\n  1893), with companion volume, _Selections from the Attic Orators_ (2nd\r\n  ed., 1888); _Bentley_ (1882); _Sophocles_ (3rd ed., 1893) the seven\r\n  plays, text, English translation and notes, the promised edition of\r\n  the fragments being prevented by his death; _Bacchylides_ (1905),\r\n  text, translation, and notes; _Homer_ (3rd ed., 1888), an introduction\r\n  to the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_; _Modern Greece_ (1901); _The Growth and\r\n  Influence of Classical Greek Poetry_ (1893). His translation of the\r\n  _Rhetoric_ of Aristotle was published posthumously under the\r\n  editorship of J. E. Sandys (1909). A selection from his _Essays and\r\n  Addresses_, and a subsequent volume, _Life and Letters of Sir Richard\r\n  Claverhouse Jebb_ (with critical introduction by A. W. Verrall) were\r\n  published by his widow in 1907; see also an appreciative notice by J.\r\n  E. Sandys, _Hist. of Classical Scholarship_, iii. (1908).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEBEIL (anc. _Gebal-Byblus_), a town of Syria pleasantly situated on a\r\nslight eminence near the sea, about 20 m. N. of Beirut. It is surrounded\r\nby a wall 1½ m. in circumference, with square towers at the angles, and\r\na castle at the south-east corner. Numerous broken granite columns in\r\nthe gardens and vineyards that surround the town, with the number of\r\nruined houses within the walls, testify to its former importance. The\r\nstele of Jehawmelek, king of Gebal, found here, is one of the most\r\nimportant of Phoenician monuments. The small port is almost choked up\r\nwith sand and ruins. Pop. 3000, all Moslems.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the Phoenician Gebal and Greek Byblus were renowned\r\nas stonecutters and ship-builders. Arrian (ii. 20. 1) represents Enylus,\r\nking of Byblus, as joining Alexander with a fleet, after that monarch\r\nhad captured the city. Philo of Byblus makes it the most ancient city of\r\nPhoenicia, founded by Cronus, i.e. the Moloch who appears from the stele\r\nof Jehawmelek to have been with Baalit the chief deity of the city.\r\nAccording to Plutarch (_Mor._ 357), the ark with the corpse of Osiris\r\nwas cast ashore at Byblus, and there found by Isis. The orgies of\r\nAdonis in the temple of Baalit (Aphrodite Byblia) are described by\r\nLucian, _De Dea Syr._, cap. vi. The river Adonis is the Nahr al-Ibrahim,\r\nwhich flows near the town. The crusaders, after failing before it in\r\n1099, captured \"Giblet\" in 1103, but lost it again to Saladin in 1189.\r\nUnder Mahommedan rule it has gradually decayed.     (D. G. H.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEBEL (plur. _jibal_), also written GEBEL with hard _g_ (plur. _gibal_),\r\nan Arabic word meaning a mountain or a mountain chain. It is frequently\r\nused in place-names. The French transliteration of the word is _djebel_.\r\n_Jebeli_ signifies a mountaineer. The pronunciation with a hard _g_\r\nsound is that used in the Egyptian dialect of Arabic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEDBURGH, a royal and police burgh and county-town of Roxburghshire,\r\nScotland. Pop. of police burgh (1901), 3136. It is situated on Jed\r\nWater, a tributary of the Teviot, 56¼ m. S.E. of Edinburgh by the North\r\nBritish railway, via Roxburgh and St Boswells (49 m. by road), and 10 m.\r\nfrom the border at Catcleuch Shin, a peak of the Cheviots, 1742 ft.\r\nhigh. Of the name Jedburgh there have been many variants, the earliest\r\nbeing Gedwearde (800), Jedwarth (1251), and Geddart (1586), while\r\nlocally the word is sometimes pronounced Jethart. The town is situated\r\non the left bank of the Jed, the main streets running at right angles\r\nfrom each side of the central market-place. Of the renowned group of\r\nBorder abbeys--Jedburgh, Melrose, Dryburgh and Kelso--that of Jedburgh\r\nis the stateliest. In 1118, according to tradition, but more probably as\r\nlate as 1138, David, prince of Cumbria, here founded a priory for\r\nAugustinian monks from the abbey of St Quentin at Beauvais in France,\r\nand in 1147, after he had become king, erected it into an abbey\r\ndedicated to the Virgin. Repeatedly damaged in Border warfare, it was\r\nruined in 1544-45 during the English invasion led by Sir Ralph Evers (or\r\nEure). The establishment was suppressed in 1559, the revenues being\r\ntemporarily annexed to the Crown. After changing owners more than once,\r\nthe lands were purchased in 1637 by the 3rd earl of Lothian. Latterly\r\nfive of the bays at the west end had been utilized as the parish church,\r\nbut in 1873-1875 the 9th marquess of Lothian built a church for the\r\nservice of the parish, and presented it to the heritors in exchange for\r\nthe ruined abbey in order to prevent the latter from being injured by\r\nmodern additions and alterations.\r\n\r\n  The abbey was built of Old Red sandstone, and belongs mostly to the\r\n  end of the 12th and the beginning of the 13th centuries. The\r\n  architecture is mixed, and the abbey is a beautiful example of the\r\n  Norman and Transition styles. The total length is 235 ft., the nave\r\n  being 133½ ft. long and 59½ ft. wide. The west front contains a great\r\n  Norman porch and a fine wheel window. The nave, on each side, has nine\r\n  pointed arches in the basement storey, nine round arches in the\r\n  triforium, and thirty-six pointed arches in the clerestory, through\r\n  which an arcade is carried on both sides. The tower, at the\r\n  intersection of the nave and transepts, is of unusually massive\r\n  proportions, being 30 ft. square and fully 100 ft. high; the network\r\n  baluster round the top is modern. With the exception of the north\r\n  piers and a small portion of the wall above, which are Norman, the\r\n  tower dates from the end of the 15th century. The whole of the south\r\n  transept has perished. The north transept, with early Decorated\r\n  windows, has been covered in and walled off, and is the burial-ground\r\n  of the Kerrs of Fernihirst, ancestors of the marquess of Lothian. The\r\n  earliest tombstone is dated 1524; one of the latest is the recumbent\r\n  effigy, by G. F. Watts, R.A., of the 8th marquess of Lothian\r\n  (1832-1870). All that is left of the choir, which contains some very\r\n  early Norman work, is two bays with three tiers on each side,\r\n  corresponding to the design of the nave. It is supposed that the\r\n  aisle, with Decorated window and groined roof, south of the chancel,\r\n  formed the grammar school (removed from the abbey in 1751) in which\r\n  Samuel Rutherford (1600-1661), principal of St Mary's College, St\r\n  Andrews, and James Thomson, author of The _Seasons_, were educated.\r\n  The door leading from the south aisle into a herbaceous garden,\r\n  formerly the cloister, is an exquisite copy of one which had become\r\n  greatly decayed. It was designed by Sir Rowand Anderson, under whose\r\n  superintendence restoration in the abbey was carried out.\r\n\r\nThe castle stood on high ground at the south end of the burgh, or\r\n\"town-head.\" Erected by David I., it was one of the strongholds ceded to\r\nEngland in 1174, under the treaty of Falaise, for the ransom of William\r\nthe Lion. It was, however, so often captured by the English that it\r\nbecame a menace rather than a protection, and the townsfolk demolished\r\nit in 1409. It had occasionally been used as a royal residence, and was\r\nthe scene, in November 1285, of the revels held in celebration of the\r\nmarriage (solemnized in the abbey) of Alexander III. to Joleta, or\r\nYolande, daughter of the count of Dreux. The site was occupied in 1823\r\nby the county prison, now known as the castle, a castellated structure\r\nwhich gradually fell into disuse and was acquired by the corporation in\r\n1890. A house exists in Backgate in which Mary Queen of Scots resided in\r\n1566, and one in Castlegate which Prince Charles Edward occupied in\r\n1745.\r\n\r\nThe public buildings include the grammar school (built in 1883 to\r\nreplace the successor of the school in the abbey), founded by William\r\nTurnbull, bishop of Glasgow (d. 1454), the county buildings, the free\r\nlibrary and the public hall, which succeeded to the corn exchange\r\ndestroyed by fire in 1898, a loss that involved the museum and its\r\ncontents, including the banners captured by the Jethart weavers at\r\nBannockburn and Killiecrankie. The old market cross still exists, and\r\nthere are two public parks. The chief industry is the manufacture of\r\nwoollens (blankets, hosiery), but brewing, tanning and iron-founding are\r\ncarried on, and fruit (especially pears) and garden produce are in\r\nrepute. Jedburgh was made a royal burgh in the reign of David I., and\r\nreceived a charter from Robert I. and another, in 1566, from Mary Queen\r\nof Scots. Sacked and burned time after time during the Border strife, it\r\nwas inevitable that the townsmen should become keen fighters. Their cry\r\nof \"Jethart's here!\" was heard wherever the fray waxed most fiercely,\r\nand the Jethart axe of their invention--a steel axe on a 4-ft.\r\npole--wrought havoc in their hands.\r\n\r\n\"Jethart or Jeddart justice,\" according to which a man was hanged first\r\nand tried afterwards, seems to have been a hasty generalization from a\r\nsolitary fact--the summary execution in James VI.'s reign of a gang of\r\nrogues at the instance of Sir George Home, but has nevertheless passed\r\ninto a proverb.\r\n\r\nOld Jeddart, 4 m. S. of the present town, the first site of the burgh,\r\nis now marked by a few grassy mounds, and of the great Jedburgh forest,\r\nonly the venerable oaks, the \"Capon Tree\" and the \"King of the Woods\"\r\nremain. Dunion Hill (1095 ft.), about 2 m. south-west of Jedburgh,\r\ncommands a fine view of the capital of the county.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEEJEEBHOY (JIJIBHAI), SIR JAMSETJEE (JAMSETJI), Bart. (1783-1859),\r\nIndian merchant and philanthropist, was born in Bombay in 1783, of poor\r\nbut respectable parents, and was left an orphan in early life. At the\r\nage of sixteen, with a smattering of mercantile education and a bare\r\npittance, he commenced a series of business travels destined to lead him\r\nto fortune and fame. After a preliminary visit to Calcutta, he undertook\r\na voyage to China, then fraught with so much difficulty and risk that it\r\nwas regarded as a venture betokening considerable enterprise and\r\ncourage; and he subsequently initiated a systematic trade with that\r\ncountry, being himself the carrier of his merchant wares on his passages\r\nto and fro between Bombay and Canton and Shanghai. His second return\r\nvoyage from China was made in one of the East India Company's fleet,\r\nwhich, under the command of Sir Nathaniel Dance, defeated the French\r\nsquadron under Admiral Linois (Feb. 15, 1804). On his fourth return\r\nvoyage from China, the Indiaman in which he sailed was forced to\r\nsurrender to the French, by whom he was carried as a prisoner to the\r\nCape of Good Hope, then a neutral Dutch possession; and it was only\r\nafter much delay, and with great difficulty, that he made his way to\r\nCalcutta in a Danish ship. Nothing daunted, he undertook yet another\r\nvoyage to China, which was more successful than any of the previous\r\nones. By this time he had fairly established his reputation as a\r\nmerchant possessed of the highest spirit of enterprise and considerable\r\nwealth, and thenceforward he settled down in Bombay, where he directed\r\nhis commercial operations on a widely extended scale. By 1836 his firm\r\nwas large enough to engross the energies of his three sons and other\r\nrelatives; and he had amassed what at that period of Indian mercantile\r\nhistory was regarded as fabulous wealth. An essentially self-made man,\r\nhaving experienced in early life the miseries of poverty and want, in\r\nhis days of affluence Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy developed an active instinct\r\nof sympathy with his poorer countrymen, and commenced that career of\r\nprivate and public philanthropy which is his chief title to the\r\nadmiration of mankind. His liberality was unbounded, and the absorbing\r\noccupation of his later life was the alleviation of human distress. To\r\nhis own community he gave lavishly, but his benevolence was mainly\r\ncosmopolitan. Hospitals, schools, homes of charity, pension funds, were\r\nfounded or endowed by him, while numerous public works in the shape of\r\nwells, reservoirs, bridges, causeways, and the like, not only in Bombay,\r\nbut in other parts of India, were the creation of his bounty. The total\r\nof his known benefactions amounted at the time of his death, which took\r\nplace in 1859, to over £230,000. It was not, however, the amount of his\r\ncharities so much as the period and circumstances in which they were\r\nperformed that made his benevolent career worthy of the fame he won. In\r\nthe first half of the 19th century the various communities of India were\r\nmuch more isolated in their habits and their sympathies than they are\r\nnow. Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy's unsectarian philanthropy awakened a common\r\nunderstanding and created a bond between them which has proved not only\r\nof domestic value but has had a national and political significance. His\r\nservices were recognized first in 1842 by the bestowal of a knighthood\r\nupon him, and in 1858 by that of a baronetcy. These were the very first\r\ndistinctions of their kind conferred by Queen Victoria upon a British\r\nsubject in India.\r\n\r\nHis title devolved in 1859 on his eldest son CURSETJEE, who, by a\r\nspecial Act of the Viceroy's Council in pursuance of a provision in the\r\nletters-patent, took the name of Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy as second\r\nbaronet. At his death in 1877 his eldest son, MENEKJEE, became Sir\r\nJamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, the third baronet. Both had the advantage of a\r\ngood English education, and continued the career of benevolent activity\r\nand devoted loyalty to British rule which had signalized the life-work\r\nof the founder of the family. They both visited England to do homage to\r\ntheir sovereign; and their public services were recognized by their\r\nnomination to the order of the Star of India, as well as by appointment\r\nto the Legislative Councils of Calcutta and Bombay.\r\n\r\nOn the death of the third baronet, the title devolved upon his brother,\r\nCOWSAJEE (1853-1908), who became Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, fourth\r\nbaronet, and the recognized leader of the Parsee community all over the\r\nworld. He was succeeded by his son RUSTOMJEE (b. 1878), who became Sir\r\nJamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, fifth baronet.\r\n\r\nSince their emigration from Persia, the Parsee community had never had a\r\ntitular chief or head, its communal funds and affairs being managed by a\r\npublic body, more or less democratic in its constitution, termed the\r\nParsee panchayat. The first Sir Jamsetjee, by the hold that he\r\nestablished on the community, by his charities and public spirit,\r\ngradually came to be regarded in the light of its chief; and the\r\nrecognition which he was the first in India to receive at the hands of\r\nthe British sovereign finally fixed him and his successors in the\r\nbaronetcy in the position and title of the official Parsee leader.\r\n     (M. M. Bh.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEFFERIES, RICHARD (1848-1887), English naturalist and author, was born\r\non the 6th of November 1848, at the farmhouse of Coate about 2½ m. from\r\nSwindon, on the road to Marlborough. He was sent to school, first at\r\nSydenham and then at Swindon, till the age of fifteen or so, but his\r\nactual education was at the hands of his father, who gave him his love\r\nfor Nature and taught him how to observe. For the faculty of\r\nobservation, as Jefferies, Gilbert White, and H. D. Thoreau have\r\nremarked, several gifts are necessary, including the possession of long\r\nsight and quick sight, two things which do not always go together. To\r\nthem must be joined trained sight and the knowledge of what to expect.\r\nThe boy's father first showed him what there was to look for in the\r\nhedge, in the field, in the trees, and in the sky. This kind of training\r\nwould in many cases be wasted: to one who can understand it, the book of\r\nNature will by-and-by offer pages which are blurred and illegible to the\r\ncity-bred lad, and even to the country lad the power of reading them\r\nmust be maintained by constant practice. To live amid streets or in the\r\nworking world destroys it. The observer must live alone and always in\r\nthe country; he must not worry himself about the ways of the world; he\r\nmust be always, from day to day, watching the infinite changes and\r\nvariations of Nature. Perhaps, even when the observer can actually read\r\nthis book of Nature, his power of articulate speech may prove inadequate\r\nfor the expression of what he sees. But Jefferies, as a boy, was more\r\nthan an observer of the fields; he was bookish, and read all the books\r\nthat he could borrow or buy. And presently, as is apt to be the fate of\r\na bookish boy who cannot enter a learned profession, he became a\r\njournalist and obtained a post on the local paper. He developed literary\r\nambitions, but for a long time to come was as one beating the air. He\r\ntried local history and novels; but his early novels, which were\r\npublished at his own risk and expense, were, deservedly, failures. In\r\n1872, however, he published a remarkable letter in _The Times_, on \"The\r\nWiltshire Labourer,\" full of original ideas and of facts new to most\r\nreaders. This was in reality the turning-point in his career. In 1873,\r\nafter more false starts, Jefferies returned to his true field of work,\r\nthe life of the country, and began to write for _Fraser's Magazine_ on\r\n\"Farming and Farmers.\" He had now found himself. The rest of his history\r\nis that of continual advance, from close observation becoming daily more\r\nand more close, to that intimate communion with Nature with which his\r\nlater pages are filled. The developments of the later period are\r\nthroughout touched with the melancholy that belongs to ill-health. For,\r\nthough in his prose poem called \"The Pageant of Summer\" the writer seems\r\nabsolutely revelling in the strength of manhood that belongs to that\r\npageant, yet, in the _Story of My Heart_, written about the same time,\r\nwe detect the mind that is continually turned to death. He died at\r\nGoring, worn out with many ailments, on the 14th of August 1887. The\r\nbest-known books of Richard Jefferies are: _The Gamekeeper at Home_\r\n(1878); _The Story of My Heart_ (1883); _Life of the Fields_ (1884),\r\ncontaining the best paper he ever wrote, \"The Pageant of Summer\";\r\n_Amaryllis at the Fair_ (1884), in which may be found the portraits of\r\nhis own people; and _The Open Air_. He stands among the scanty company\r\nof men who address a small audience, for whom he read aloud these pages\r\nof Nature spoken of above, which only he, and the few like unto him, can\r\ndecipher.\r\n\r\n  See Sir Walter Besant, _Eulogy of Richard Jefferies_ (1888); H. S.\r\n  Salt, _Richard Jefferies: a Study_ (1894); Edward Thomas, _Richard\r\n  Jefferies, his Life and Work_ (1909).     (W. Be.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEFFERSON, JOSEPH (1820-1905), American actor, was born in Philadelphia\r\non the 20th of February 1829. He was the third actor of this name in a\r\nfamily of actors and managers, and the most famous of all American\r\ncomedians. At the age of three he appeared as the boy in Kotzebue's\r\n_Pizarro_, and throughout his youth he underwent all the hardships\r\nconnected with theatrical touring in those early days. After a\r\nmiscellaneous experience, partly as actor, partly as manager, he won his\r\nfirst pronounced success in 1858 as Asa Trenchard in Tom Taylor's _Our\r\nAmerican Cousin_ at Laura Keene's theatre in New York. This play was the\r\nturning-point of his career, as it was of Sothern's. The naturalness and\r\nspontaneity of humour with which he acted the love scenes revealed a\r\nspirit in comedy new to his contemporaries, long used to a more\r\nartificial convention; and the touch of pathos which the part required\r\nrevealed no less to the actor an unexpected power in himself. Other\r\nearly parts were Newman Noggs in _Nicholas Nickleby_, Caleb Plummer in\r\n_The Cricket on the Hearth_, Dr Pangloss in _The Heir at Law_, Salem\r\nScudder in _The Octoroon_, and Bob Acres in _The Rivals_, the last being\r\nnot so much an interpretation of the character as Sheridan sketched it\r\nas a creation of the actor's. In 1859 Jefferson made a dramatic version\r\nof the story of _Rip Van Winkle_ on the basis of older plays, and acted\r\nit with success at Washington. The play was given its permanent form by\r\nDion Boucicault in London, where (1865) it ran 170 nights, with\r\nJefferson in the leading part. Jefferson continued to act with\r\nundiminished popularity in a limited number of parts in nearly every\r\ntown in the United States, his Rip Van Winkle, Bob Acres, and Caleb\r\nPlummer being the most popular. He was one of the first to establish the\r\ntravelling combinations which superseded the old system of local stock\r\ncompanies. With the exception of minor parts, such as the First\r\nGravedigger in _Hamlet_, which he played in an \"all star combination\"\r\nheaded by Edwin Booth, Jefferson created no new character after 1865;\r\nand the success of Rip Van Winkle was so pronounced that he has often\r\nbeen called a one-part actor. If this was a fault, it was the public's,\r\nwho never wearied of his one masterpiece. Jefferson died on the 23rd of\r\nApril 1905. No man in his profession was more honoured for his\r\nachievements or his character. He was the friend of many of the leading\r\nmen in American politics, art and literature. He was an ardent fisherman\r\nand lover of nature, and devoted to painting. Jefferson was twice\r\nmarried: to an actress, Margaret Clements Lockyer (1832-1861), in 1850,\r\nand in 1867 to Sarah Warren, niece of William Warren the actor.\r\n\r\n  Jefferson's _Autobiography_ (New York, 1889) is written with admirable\r\n  spirit and humour, and its judgments with regard to the art of the\r\n  actor and of the playwright entitle it to a place beside Cibber's\r\n  _Apology_. See William Winter, _The Jeffersons_ (1881), and _Life of\r\n  Joseph Jefferson_ (1894); Mrs. E. P. Jefferson, _Recollections of\r\n  Joseph Jefferson_ (1909).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEFFERSON, THOMAS (1743-1826), third president of the United States of\r\nAmerica, and the most conspicuous apostle of democracy in America, was\r\nborn on the 13th of April 1743, at Shadwell, Albemarle county, Virginia.\r\nHis father, Peter Jefferson (1707-1757), of early Virginian yeoman\r\nstock, was a civil engineer and a man of remarkable energy, who became a\r\njustice of the peace, a county surveyor and a burgess, served the Crown\r\nin inter-colonial boundary surveys, and married into one of the most\r\nprominent colonial families, the Randolphs. Albemarle county was then in\r\nthe frontier wilderness of the Blue Ridge, and was very different,\r\nsocially, from the lowland counties where a few broad-acred families\r\ndominated an open-handed, somewhat luxurious and assertive aristocracy.\r\nUnlike his Randolph connexions, Peter Jefferson was a whig and a\r\nthorough democrat; from him, and probably, too, from the Albemarle\r\nenvironment, his son came naturally by democratic inclinations.\r\n\r\nJefferson carried with him from the college of William and Mary at\r\nWilliamsburg, in his twentieth year, a good knowledge of Latin, Greek\r\nand French (to which he soon added Spanish, Italian and Anglo-Saxon),\r\nand a familiarity with the higher mathematics and natural sciences only\r\npossessed, at his age, by men who have a rare natural taste and ability\r\nfor those studies. He remained an ardent student throughout life, able\r\nto give and take in association with the many scholars, American and\r\nforeign, whom he numbered among his friends and correspondents. With a\r\nliberal Scotsman, Dr William Small, then of the faculty of William and\r\nMary and later a friend of Erasmus Darwin, and George Wythe (1726-1806),\r\na very accomplished scholar and leader of the Virginia bar, Jefferson\r\nwas an habitual member, while still in college, of a _partie carrée_ at\r\nthe table of Francis Fauquier (c. 1720-1768), the accomplished\r\nlieutenant-governor of Virginia. Jefferson was an expert violinist, a\r\ngood singer and dancer, proficient in outdoor sports, and an excellent\r\nhorseman. Thorough-bred horses always remained to him a necessary\r\nluxury. When it is added that Fauquier was a passionate gambler, and\r\nthat the gentry who gathered every winter at Williamsburg, the seat of\r\ngovernment of the province, were ruinously addicted to the same\r\nweakness, and that Jefferson had a taste for racing, it does credit to\r\nhis early strength of character that of his social opportunities he took\r\nonly the better. He never used tobacco, never played cards, never\r\ngambled, and was never party to a personal quarrel.\r\n\r\nSoon after leaving college he entered Wythe's law office, and in 1767,\r\nafter five years of close study, was admitted to the bar. His thorough\r\npreparation enabled him to compete from the first with the leading\r\nlawyers of the colony, and his success shows that the bar had no rewards\r\nthat were not fairly within his reach. As an advocate, however, he did\r\nnot shine; a weakness of voice made continued speaking impossible, and\r\nhe had neither the ability nor the temperament for oratory. To his legal\r\nscholarship and collecting zeal Virginia owed the preservation of a\r\nlarge part of her early statutes. He seems to have lacked interest in\r\nlitigiousness, which was extraordinarily developed in colonial\r\nVirginia; and he saw and wished to reform the law's abuses. It is\r\nprobable that he turned, therefore, the more willingly to politics; at\r\nany rate, soon after entering public life he abandoned practice (1774).\r\n\r\nThe death of his father had left him an estate of 1900 acres, the income\r\nfrom which (about £400) gave him the position of an independent country\r\ngentleman; and while engaged in the law he had added to his farms after\r\nthe ambitious Virginia fashion, until, when he married in his thirtieth\r\nyear, there were 5000 acres all paid for; and almost as much more[1]\r\ncame to him in 1773 on the death of his father-in-law. On the 1st of\r\nJanuary 1772, Jefferson married Martha Wayles Skelton (1749-1782), a\r\nchildless widow of twenty-three, very handsome, accomplished, and very\r\nfond of music. Their married life was exceedingly happy, and Jefferson\r\nnever remarried after her early death. Of six children born from their\r\nunion, two daughters alone survived infancy. Jefferson was emotional and\r\nvery affectionate in his home, and his generous and devoted relations\r\nwith his children and grandchildren are among the finest features of his\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nJefferson began his public service as a justice of the peace and parish\r\nvestryman; he was chosen a member of the Virginia house of burgesses in\r\n1769 and of every succeeding assembly and convention of the colony until\r\nhe entered the Continental Congress in 1775. His forceful, facile pen\r\ngave him great influence from the first; but though a foremost member of\r\nseveral great deliberative bodies, he can fairly be said never to have\r\nmade a speech. He hated the \"morbid rage of debate\" because he believed\r\nthat men were never convinced by argument, but only by reflection,\r\nthrough reading or unprovocative conversation; and this belief guided\r\nhim through life. Moreover it is very improbable that he could ever have\r\nshone as a public speaker, and to this fact unfriendly critics have\r\nattributed, at least in part, his abstention from debate. The house of\r\nburgesses of 1769, and its successors in 1773 and 1774, were dissolved\r\nby the governor (see VIRGINIA) for their action on the subject of\r\ncolonial grievances and inter-colonial co-operation. Jefferson was\r\nprominent in all; was a signer of the Virginia agreement of\r\nnon-importation and economy (1769); and was elected in 1774 to the first\r\nVirginia convention, called to consider the state of the colony and\r\nadvance inter-colonial union. Prevented by illness from attending,\r\nJefferson sent to the convention elaborate resolutions, which he\r\nproposed as instructions to the Virginia delegates to the Continental\r\nCongress that was to meet at Philadelphia in September. In the direct\r\nlanguage of reproach and advice, with no disingenuous loading of the\r\nCrown's policy upon its agents, these resolutions attacked the errors of\r\nthe king, and maintained that \"the relation between Great Britain and\r\nthese colonies was exactly the same as that of England and Scotland\r\nafter the accession of James and until the Union; and that our\r\nemigration to this country gave England no more rights over us than the\r\nemigration of the Danes and Saxons gave to the present authorities of\r\ntheir mother country over England.\" This was cutting at the common root\r\nof allegiance, emigration and colonization; but such radicalism was too\r\nthorough-going for the immediate end. The resolutions were published,\r\nhowever, as a pamphlet, entitled _A Summary View of the Rights of\r\nAmerica_, which was widely circulated. In England, after receiving such\r\nmodifications--attributed to Burke--as adapted it to the purposes of the\r\nopposition, this pamphlet ran through many editions, and procured for\r\nits author, as he said, \"the honour of having his name inserted in a\r\nlong list of proscriptions enrolled in a bill of attainder commenced in\r\none of the two houses of parliament, but suppressed in embryo by the\r\nhasty course of events.\" It placed Jefferson among the foremost leaders\r\nof revolution, and procured for him the honour of drafting, later, the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, whose historical portions were, in large\r\npart, only a revised transcript of the _Summary View_. In June 1775 he\r\ntook his seat in the Continental Congress, taking with him fresh\r\ncredentials of radicalism in the shape of Virginia's answer, which he\r\nhad drafted, to Lord North's conciliatory propositions. Jefferson soon\r\ndrafted the reply of Congress to the same propositions. Reappointed to\r\nthe next Congress, he signalized his service by the authorship of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence (q.v.). Again reappointed, he surrendered\r\nhis seat, and after refusing a proffered election to serve as a\r\ncommissioner with Benjamin Franklin and Silas Deane in France, he\r\nentered again, in October 1776, the Virginia legislature, where he\r\nconsidered his services most needed.\r\n\r\nThe local work to which Jefferson attributed such importance was a\r\nrevision of Virginia's laws. Of the measures proposed to this end he\r\nsays: \"I considered four, passed or reported, as forming a system by\r\nwhich every trace would be eradicated of ancient or future aristocracy,\r\nand a foundation laid for a government truly republican\"--the repeal of\r\nthe laws of entail; the abolition of primogeniture and the unequal\r\ndivision of inheritances (Jefferson was himself an eldest son); the\r\nguarantee of freedom of conscience and relief of the people from\r\nsupporting, by taxation, an established church; and a system of general\r\neducation. The first object was embodied in law in 1776, the second in\r\n1785, the third[2] in 1786 (supplemented 1799, 1801). The last two were\r\nparts of a body of codified laws prepared (1776-1779) by Edmund\r\nPendleton,[3] George Wythe, and Jefferson, and principally by Jefferson.\r\nNot so fortunate were Jefferson's ambitious schemes of education.\r\nDistrict, grammar and classical schools, a free state library and a\r\nstate college, were all included in his plan. He was the first American\r\nstatesman to make education by the state a fundamental article of\r\ndemocratic faith. His bill for elementary education he regarded as the\r\nmost important part of the code, but Virginia had no strong middle\r\nclass, and the planters would not assume the burden of educating the\r\npoor. At this time Jefferson championed the natural right of\r\nexpatriation, and gradual emancipation of the slaves. His earliest\r\nlegislative effort, in the five-day session of 1769, had been marked by\r\nan effort to secure to masters freedom to manumit their slaves without\r\nremoving them from the state. It was unsuccessful, and the more radical\r\nmeasure he now favoured was even more impossible of attainment; but a\r\nbill he introduced to prohibit the importation of slaves was passed in\r\n1778--the only important change effected in the slave system of the\r\nstate during the War of Independence. Finally he endeavoured, though\r\nunsuccessfully, to secure the introduction of juries into the courts of\r\nchancery, and--a generation and more before the fruition of the labours\r\nof Romilly and his co-workers in England--aided in securing a\r\nhumanitarian revision of the penal code,[4] which, though lost by one\r\nvote in 1785, was sustained by public sentiment, and was adopted in\r\n1796. Jefferson is of course not entitled to the sole credit for all\r\nthese services: Wythe, George Mason and James Madison, in particular,\r\nwere his devoted lieutenants, and--after his departure for France--the\r\nprincipals in the struggle; moreover, an approving public opinion must\r\nreceive large credit. But Jefferson was throughout the chief inspirer\r\nand foremost worker.\r\n\r\nIn 1779, at almost the gloomiest stage of the war in the southern\r\nstates, Jefferson succeeded Patrick Henry as the governor of Virginia,\r\nbeing the second to hold that office after the organization of the state\r\ngovernment. In his second term (1780-1781) the state was overrun by\r\nBritish expeditions, and Jefferson, a civilian, was blamed for the\r\nineffectual resistance. Though he cannot be said to have been eminently\r\nfitted for the task that devolved upon him in such a crisis, most of the\r\ncriticism of his administration was undoubtedly grossly unjust. His\r\nconduct being attacked, he declined renomination for the governorship,\r\nbut was unanimously returned by Albemarle as a delegate to the state\r\nlegislature; and on the day previously set for legislative inquiry on a\r\nresolution offered by an impulsive critic, he received, by unanimous\r\nvote of the house, a declaration of thanks and confidence. He wished\r\nhowever to retire permanently from public life, a wish strengthened by\r\nthe illness and death of his wife. At this time he composed his _Notes\r\non Virginia_, a semi-statistical work full of humanitarian liberalism.\r\nCongress twice offered him an appointment as one of the\r\nplenipotentiaries to negotiate peace with England, but, though he\r\naccepted the second offer, the business was so far advanced before he\r\ncould sail that his appointment was recalled. During the following\r\nwinter (1783) he was again in Congress, and headed the committee\r\nappointed to consider the treaty of peace. In the succeeding session his\r\nservice was marked by a report, from which resulted the present monetary\r\nsystem of the United States (the fundamental idea of its decimal basis\r\nbeing due, however, to Gouverneur Morris); and by the honour of\r\nreporting the first definitely formulated plan for the government of the\r\nwestern territories,[5] that embodied in the ordinance of 1784. He was\r\nalready particularly associated with the great territory north-west of\r\nthe Ohio; for Virginia had tendered to Congress in 1781, while Jefferson\r\nwas governor, a cession of her claims to it, and now in 1784 formally\r\ntransferred the territory by act of Jefferson and his fellow delegates\r\nin congress: a consummation for which he had laboured from the\r\nbeginning. His anti-slavery opinions grew in strength with years (though\r\nhe was somewhat inconsistent in his attitude on the Missouri question in\r\n1820-1821). Not only justice but patriotism as well pleaded with him the\r\ncause of the negroes,[6] for he foresaw the certainty that the race must\r\nsome day, in some way, be freed, and the dire political dangers involved\r\nin the institution of slavery; and could any feasible plan of\r\nemancipation have been suggested he would have regarded its cost as a\r\nmere bagatelle.\r\n\r\nFrom 1784 to 1789 Jefferson was in France, first under an appointment to\r\nassist Benjamin Franklin and John Adams in negotiating treaties of\r\ncommerce with European states, and then as Franklin's successor\r\n(1785-1789) as minister to France.[7] In these years he travelled widely\r\nin western Europe. Though the commercial principles of the United States\r\nwere far too liberal for acceptance, as such, by powers holding colonies\r\nin America, Jefferson won some specific concessions to American trade.\r\nHe was exceedingly popular as a minister. The criticism is even to-day\r\ncurrent with the uninformed that Jefferson took his manners,[8] morals,\r\n\"irreligion\" and political philosophy from his French residence; and it\r\ncannot be wholly ignored. It may therefore be said that there is nothing\r\nexcept unsubstantiated scandal to contradict the conclusion, which\r\nvarious evidence supports, that Jefferson's morals were pure. His\r\nreligious views and political beliefs will be discussed later. His\r\ntheories had a deep and broad basis in English whiggism; and though he\r\nmay well have found at least confirmation of his own ideas in French\r\nwriters--and notably in Condorcet--he did not read sympathetically the\r\nwriters commonly named, Rousseau and Montesquieu; besides, his democracy\r\nwas seasoned, and he was rather a teacher than a student of\r\nrevolutionary politics when he went to Paris. The _Notes on Virginia_\r\nwere widely read in Paris, and undoubtedly had some influence in\r\nforwarding the dissolution of the doctrines of divine rights and passive\r\nobedience among the cultivated classes of France. Jefferson was deeply\r\ninterested in all the events leading up to the French Revolution, and\r\nall his ideas were coloured by his experience of the five seething years\r\npassed in Paris. On the 3rd of June 1789 he proposed to the leaders of\r\nthe third estate a compromise between the king and the nation. In July\r\nhe received the extraordinary honour of being invited to assist in the\r\ndeliberations of the committee appointed by the national assembly to\r\ndraft a constitution. This honour his official position compelled him,\r\nof course, to decline; for he sedulously observed official proprieties,\r\nand in no way gave offence to the government to which he was accredited.\r\n\r\nWhen Jefferson left France it was with the intention of soon returning;\r\nbut President Washington tendered him the secretaryship of state in the\r\nnew federal government, and Jefferson reluctantly accepted. His only\r\nessential objection to the constitution--the absence of a bill of\r\nrights--was soon met, at least partially, by amendments. Alexander\r\nHamilton (q.v.) was secretary of the treasury. These two men, antipodal\r\nin temperament and political belief, clashed in irreconcilable\r\nhostility, and in the conflict of public sentiment, first on the\r\nfinancial measures of Hamilton, and then on the questions with regard to\r\nFrance and Great Britain, Jefferson's sympathies being predominantly\r\nwith the former, Hamilton's with the latter, they formed about\r\nthemselves the two great parties of Democrats and Federalists. The\r\nschools of thought for which they stood have since contended for mastery\r\nin American politics: Hamilton's gradually strengthened by the\r\nnecessities of stronger administration, as time gave widening amplitude\r\nand increasing weight to the specific powers--and so to Hamilton's great\r\ndoctrine of the \"implied powers\"--of the general government of a growing\r\ncountry; Jefferson's rooted in colonial life, and buttressed by the\r\nhopes and convictions of democracy.\r\n\r\nThe most perplexing questions treated by Jefferson as secretary of state\r\narose out of the policy of neutrality adopted by the United States\r\ntoward France, to whom she was bound by treaties and by a heavy debt of\r\ngratitude. Separation from European politics--the doctrine of \"America\r\nfor Americans\" that was embodied later in the Monroe declaration--was a\r\ntenet cherished by Jefferson as by other leaders (not, however,\r\nHamilton) and by none cherished more firmly, for by nature he was\r\npeculiarly opposed to war, and peace was a fundamental part of his\r\npolitics. However deep, therefore, his French sympathies, he drew the\r\nsame safe line as did Washington between French politics and American\r\npolitics,[9] and handled the Genet complications to the satisfaction of\r\neven the most partisan Federalists. He expounded, as a very high\r\nauthority has said, \"with remarkable clearness and power the nature and\r\nscope of neutral duty,\" and gave a \"classic\" statement of the doctrine\r\nof recognition.[10]\r\n\r\nBut the French question had another side in its reaction on American\r\nparties.[11] Jefferson did not read excesses in Paris as warnings\r\nagainst democracy, but as warnings against the abuses of monarchy; nor\r\ndid he regard Bonaparte's _coup d'état_ as revealing the weakness of\r\nrepublics, but rather as revealing the danger of standing armies; he did\r\nnot look on the war of the coalitions against France as one of mere\r\npowers, but as one between forms of government; and though the immediate\r\nfruits of the Revolution belied his hopes, as they did those of ardent\r\nhumanitarians the world over, he saw the broad trend of history, which\r\nvindicated his faith that a successful reformation of government in\r\nFrance would insure \"a general reformation through Europe, and the\r\nresurrection to a new life of their people.\" Each of these statements\r\ncould be reversed as regards Hamilton. It is the key to an understanding\r\nof the times to remember that the War of Independence had disjointed\r\nsociety; and democracy--which Jefferson had proclaimed in the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, and enthroned in Virginia--after\r\nstrengthening its rights by the sword, had run to excesses, particularly\r\nin the Shays' rebellion, that produced a conservative reaction. To this\r\nreaction Hamilton explicitly appealed in the convention of 1787; and of\r\nthis reaction various features of the constitution, and Hamiltonian\r\nfederalism generally, were direct fruits. Moreover, independently of\r\nspecial incentives to the alarmist and the man of property, the opinions\r\nof many Americans turned again, after the war, into a current of\r\nsympathy for England, as naturally as American commerce returned to\r\nEnglish ports. Jefferson, however, far from America in these years and\r\nunexposed to reactionary influences, came back with undiminished fervour\r\nof democracy, and the talk he heard of praise for England, and fearful\r\nrecoil before even the beginning of the revolution in France,\r\ndisheartened him, and filled him with suspicion.[12] Hating as he did\r\nfeudal class institutions and Tudor-Stuart traditions of arbitrary\r\nrule,[13] his attitude can be imagined toward Hamilton's oft-avowed\r\npartialities--and Jefferson assumed, his intrigues--for British\r\nclass-government with its eighteenth-century measure of corruption. In\r\nshort, Hamilton took from recent years the lesson of the evils of lax\r\ngovernment; whereas Jefferson clung to the other lesson, which crumbling\r\ncolonial governments had illustrated, that governments derived their\r\nstrength (and the Declaration had proclaimed that they derived their\r\njust rights) from the will of the governed. Each built his system\r\naccordingly: the one on the basis of order, the other on\r\nindividualism--which led Jefferson to liberty alike in religion and in\r\npolitics. The two men and the fate of the parties they led are\r\nunderstandable only by regarding one as the leader of reaction, the\r\nother as in line with the American tendencies. The educated classes\r\ncharacteristically furnished Federalism with a remarkable body of\r\nalarmist leaders; and thus it happened that Jefferson, because, with\r\nonly a few of his great contemporaries, he had a thorough trust and\r\nconfidence in the people, became the idol of American democracy.\r\n\r\nAs Hamilton was somewhat officious and very combative, and Jefferson,\r\nalthough uncontentious, very suspicious and quite independent, both men\r\nholding inflexibly to opinions, cabinet harmony became impossible when\r\nthe two secretaries had formed parties about them and their differences\r\nwere carried into the newspapers;[14] and Washington abandoned perforce\r\nhis idea \"if parties did exist to reconcile them.\" Partly from\r\ndiscontent with a position in which he did not feel that he enjoyed the\r\nabsolute confidence of the president,[15] and partly because of the\r\nembarrassed condition of his private affairs, Jefferson repeatedly\r\nsought to resign, and finally on the 31st of December 1793, with\r\nWashington's reluctant consent, gave up his portfolio and retired to his\r\nhome at Monticello, near Charlottesville.\r\n\r\nHere he remained improving his estate (having refused a foreign mission)\r\nuntil elected vice-president in 1796. Jefferson was never truly happy\r\nexcept in the country. He loved gardening, experimented enthusiastically\r\nin varieties and rotations of crops and kept meteorological tables with\r\ndiligence. For eight years he tabulated with painful accuracy the\r\nearliest and latest appearance of thirty-seven vegetables in the\r\nWashington market. When abroad he sought out varieties of grasses,\r\ntrees, rice and olives for American experiment, and after his return\r\nfrom France received yearly for twenty-three years, from his old friend\r\nthe superintendent of the _Jardin des plantes_, a box of seeds, which he\r\ndistributed to public and private gardens throughout the United States.\r\nJefferson seems to have been the first discoverer of an exact formula\r\nfor the construction of mould-boards of least resistance for ploughs. He\r\nmanaged to make practical use of his calculus about his farms, and seems\r\nto have been remarkably apt in the practical application of mechanical\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nIn the presidential election of 1796 John Adams, the Federalist\r\ncandidate, received the largest number of electoral votes, and\r\nJefferson, the Republican candidate, the next largest number, and under\r\nthe law as it then existed the former became president and the latter\r\nvice-president. Jefferson re-entered public life with reluctance, though\r\ndoubtless with keen enough interest and resolution. He had rightly\r\nmeasured the strength of his followers, and was waiting for the\r\ngovernment to \"drift into unison\" with the republican sense of its\r\nconstituents, predicting that President Adams would be \"overborne\"\r\nthereby. This prediction was speedily fulfilled. At first the reign of\r\nterror and the X. Y. Z. disclosures strengthened the Federalists, until\r\nthese, mistaking the popular resentment against France for a reaction\r\nagainst democracy--an equivalence in their own minds--passed the alien\r\nand sedition laws. In answer to those odious measures Jefferson and\r\nMadison prepared and procured the passage of the Kentucky and Virginia\r\nresolutions. These resolutions later acquired extraordinary and\r\npernicious prominence in the historical elaboration of the\r\nstates'-rights doctrine. It is, however, unquestionably true, that as a\r\nstartling protest against measures \"to silence,\" in Jefferson's words,\r\n\"by force and not by reason the complaints or criticisms, just or\r\nunjust, of our citizens against the conduct of our agents,\" they served,\r\nin this respect, a useful purpose; and as a counterblast against\r\nHamiltonian principles of centralization they were probably, at that\r\nmoment, very salutary; while even as pieces of constitutional\r\ninterpretation it is to be remembered that they did not contemplate\r\nnullification by any single state, and, moreover, are not to be judged\r\nby constitutional principles established later by courts and war. The\r\nFederalist party had ruined itself, and it lost the presidential\r\nelection of 1800. The Republican candidates, Jefferson and Aaron Burr\r\n(q.v.), receiving equal votes, it devolved upon the House of\r\nRepresentatives, in accordance with the system which then obtained, to\r\nmake one of the two president, the other vice-president. Party feeling\r\nin America has probably never been more dangerously impassioned than in\r\nthe three years preceding this election; discount as one will the\r\ncontrary obsessions of men like Fisher Ames, Hamilton and Jefferson, the\r\ntime was fateful. Unable to induce Burr to avow Federalist principles,\r\ninfluential Federalists, in defiance of the constitution, contemplated\r\nthe desperate alternative of preventing an election, and appointing an\r\nextra-constitutional (Federalist) president _pro tempore_. Better\r\ncounsels, however, prevailed; Hamilton used his influence in favour of\r\nJefferson as against Burr, and Jefferson became president, entering upon\r\nhis duties on the 4th of March 1801. Republicans who had affiliated with\r\nthe Federalists at the time of the X. Y. Z. disclosures returned; very\r\nmany of the Federalists themselves Jefferson placated and drew over.\r\n\"Believing,\" he wrote, \"that (excepting the ardent monarchists) all our\r\ncitizens agreed in ancient whig principles\"--or, as he elsewhere\r\nexpressed it, in \"republican forms\"--\"I thought it advisable to define\r\nand declare them, and let them see the ground on which we can rally.\"\r\nThis he did in his inaugural, which, though somewhat rhetorical, is a\r\nsplendid and famous statement of democracy.[16] His conciliatory policy\r\nproduced a mild schism in his own party, but proved eminently wise, and\r\nthe state elections of 1801 fulfilled his prophecy of 1791 that the\r\npolicy of the Federalists would leave them \"all head and no body.\" In\r\n1804 he was re-elected by 162 out of 176 votes.\r\n\r\nJefferson's administrations were distinguished by the simplicity that\r\nmarked his conduct in private life. He eschewed the pomp and ceremonies,\r\nnatural inheritances from English origins, that had been an innocent\r\nsetting to the character of his two noble predecessors. His dress was of\r\n\"plain cloth\" on the day of his inauguration. Instead of driving to the\r\nCapitol in a coach and six, he walked without a guard or servant from\r\nhis lodgings--or, as a rival tradition has it, he rode, and hitched his\r\nhorse to a neighbouring fence--attended by a crowd of citizens. Instead\r\nof opening Congress with a speech to which a formal reply was expected,\r\nhe sent in a written message by a private hand. He discontinued the\r\npractice of sending ministers abroad in public vessels. Between himself\r\nand the governors of states he recognized no difference in rank. He\r\nwould not have his birthday celebrated by state balls. The weekly levée\r\nwas practically abandoned. Even such titles as \"Excellency,\"\r\n\"Honourable,\" \"Mr\" were distasteful to him. It was formally agreed in\r\ncabinet meeting that \"when brought together in society, all are\r\nperfectly equal, whether foreign or domestic, titled or untitled, in or\r\nout of office.\" Thus diplomatic grades were ignored in social precedence\r\nand foreign relations were seriously compromised by dinner-table\r\ncomplications. One minister who appeared in gold lace and dress sword\r\nfor his first, and regularly appointed, official call on the president,\r\nwas received--as he insisted with studied purpose--by Jefferson in\r\nnegligent undress and slippers down at the heel. All this was in part\r\npremeditated system[17]--a part of Jefferson's purpose to republicanize\r\nthe government and public opinion, which was the distinguishing feature\r\nof his administration; but it was also simply the nature of the man. In\r\nthe company he chose by preference, honesty and knowledge were his only\r\ntests. He knew absolutely no social distinctions in his willingness to\r\nperform services for the deserving. He held up to his daughter as an\r\nespecial model the family of a poor but gifted mechanic as one wherein\r\nshe would see \"the best examples of rational living.\" \"If it be\r\npossible,\" he said, \"to be certainly conscious of anything, I am\r\nconscious of feeling no difference between writing to the highest and\r\nlowest being on earth.\"\r\n\r\nJefferson's first administration was marked by a reduction of the army,\r\nnavy, diplomatic establishment and, to the uttermost, of governmental\r\nexpenses; some reduction of the civil service, accompanied by a large\r\nshifting of offices to Republicans; and, above all, by the Louisiana\r\nPurchase (q.v.), following which Meriwether Lewis and William Clark,\r\nsent by Jefferson, conducted their famous exploring expedition across\r\nthe continent to the Pacific (see LEWIS, MERIWETHER). Early in his term\r\nhe carried out a policy he had urged upon the government when minister\r\nto France and when vice-president, by dispatching naval forces to coerce\r\nTripoli into a decent respect for the trade of his country--the first in\r\nChristendom to gain honourable immunity from tribute or piracy in the\r\nMediterranean. The Louisiana Purchase, although the greatest\r\n\"inconsistency\" of his career, was also an illustration, in\r\ncorresponding degree, of his essential practicality, and one of the\r\ngreatest proofs of his statesmanship. It was the crowning achievement of\r\nhis administration. It is often said that Jefferson established the\r\n\"spoils system\" by his changes in the civil service. He was the\r\ninnovator, because for the first time there was opportunity for\r\ninnovation. But mere justice requires attention to the fact that\r\nincentive to that innovation, and excuse for it, were found in the\r\nabsolute one-party monopoly maintained by the Federalists. Moreover,\r\nJefferson's ideals were high; his reasons for changes were in general\r\nexcellent; he at least so far resisted the great pressure for\r\noffice--producing by his resistance dissatisfaction within his party--as\r\nnot to have lowered, apparently, the personnel of the service; and there\r\nwere no such blots on his administration as President Adams's \"midnight\r\njudges.\" Nevertheless, his record here was not clear of blots, showing a\r\nfew regrettable inconsistencies.[18] Among important but secondary\r\nmeasures of his second administration were the extinguishment of Indian\r\ntitles, and promotion of Indian emigration to lands beyond the\r\nMississippi; reorganization of the militia; fortification of the\r\nseaports; reduction of the public debt; and a simultaneous reduction of\r\ntaxes. But his second term derives most of its historical interest from\r\nthe unsuccessful efforts to convict Aaron Burr of treasonable acts in\r\nthe south-west, and from the efforts made to maintain, without war, the\r\nrights of neutrals on the high seas. In his diplomacy with Napoleon and\r\nGreat Britain Jefferson betrayed a painful incorrigibility of optimism.\r\nA national policy of \"growling before fighting\"--later practised\r\nsuccessfully enough by the United States--was not then possible; and one\r\nwriter has very justly said that what chiefly affects one in the whole\r\nmatter is the pathos of it--\"a philosopher and a friend of peace\r\nstruggling with a despot of superhuman genius, and a Tory cabinet of\r\nsuperhuman insolence and stolidity\" (Trent). It is possible to regard\r\nthe embargo policy dispassionately as an interesting illustration of\r\nJefferson's love of peace. The idea--a very old one with Jefferson--was\r\nnot entirely original; in essence it received other attempted\r\napplications in the Napoleonic period--and especially in the continental\r\nblockade. Jefferson's statesmanship had the limitations of an agrarian\r\noutlook. The extreme to which he carried his advocacy of diplomatic\r\nisolation, his opposition to the creation of an adequate navy,[19] his\r\nestimate of cities as \"sores upon the body politic,\" his prejudice\r\nagainst manufactures, trust in farmers, and political distrust of the\r\nartisan class, all reflect them.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the 4th of March 1809, Jefferson retired from the presidency,\r\nhe had been almost continuously in the public service for forty years.\r\nHe refused to be re-elected for a third time, though requested by the\r\nlegislatures of five states to be a candidate; and thus, with\r\nWashington's prior example, helped to establish a precedent deemed by\r\nhim to be of great importance under a democratic government. His\r\ninfluence seemed scarcely lessened in his retirement. Madison and\r\nMonroe, his immediate successors--neighbours and devoted friends, whom\r\nhe had advised in their early education and led in their maturer\r\nyears--consulted him on all great questions, and there was no break of\r\nprinciples in the twenty-four years of the \"Jeffersonian system.\"\r\nJefferson was one of the greatest political managers his country has\r\nknown. He had a quick eye for character, was genuinely amiable,\r\nuncontentious, tactful, masterful; and it may be assumed from his\r\nsuccess that he was wary or shrewd to a degree. It is true, moreover,\r\nthat, unless tested by a few unchanging principles, his acts were often\r\nstrikingly inconsistent; and even when so tested, not infrequently\r\nremain so in appearance. Full explanations do not remove from some\r\nimportant transactions in his political life an impression of\r\nindirectness. But reasonable judgment must find very unjust the stigma\r\nof duplicity put upon him by the Federalists. Measured by the records of\r\nother men equally successful as political leaders, there seems little of\r\nthis nature to criticize severely. Jefferson had the full courage of his\r\nconvictions. Extreme as were his principles, his pertinacity in adhering\r\nto them and his independence of expression were quite as extreme. There\r\nwere philosophic and philanthropic elements in his political faith which\r\nwill always lead some to class him as a visionary and fanatic; but\r\nalthough he certainly indulged at times in dreams at which one may still\r\nsmile, he was not, properly speaking, a visionary; nor can he with\r\njustice be stigmatized as a fanatic. He felt fervently, was not afraid\r\nto risk all on the conclusions to which his heart and his mind led him,\r\ndeclared himself with openness and energy; and he spoke and even wrote\r\nhis conclusions, how ever bold or abstract, without troubling to detail\r\nhis reasoning or clip his off-hand speculations. Certain it is that\r\nthere is much in his utterances for a less robust democracy than his own\r\nto cavil at.[20] Soar, however, as he might, he was essentially not a\r\ndoctrinaire, but an empiricist; his mind was objective. Though he\r\nremained, to the end, firm in his belief that there had been an active\r\nmonarchist party,[21] this obsession did not carry him out of touch with\r\nthe realities of human nature and of his time. He built with surety on\r\nthe colonial past, and had a better reasoned view of the actual future\r\nthan had any of his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nEvents soon appraised the ultra-Federalist judgment of American\r\ndemocracy, so tersely expressed by Fisher Ames as \"like death ... only\r\nthe dismal passport to a more dismal hereafter\"; and, with it, appraised\r\nJefferson's word in his first inaugural for those who, \"in the full tide\r\nof successful experiment,\" were ready to abandon a government that had\r\nso far kept them \"free and firm, on the visionary fear that it might by\r\npossibility lack energy to preserve itself.\" Time soon tested, too, his\r\nprinciple that that government must prove the strongest on earth \"where\r\nevery man ... would meet invasions of the public order as his own\r\npersonal concern.\" He summed up as follows the difference between\r\nhimself and the Hamiltonian group: \"One feared most the ignorance of the\r\npeople; the other the selfishness of rulers independent of them.\"\r\nJefferson, in short, had unlimited faith in the honesty of the people; a\r\nlarge faith in their common sense; believed that all is to be won by\r\nappealing to the reason of voters; that by education their ignorance can\r\nbe eliminated; that human nature is indefinitely perfectible; that\r\nmajorities rule, therefore, not only by virtue of force (which was\r\nLocke's ultimate justification of them), but of right.[22] His\r\nimportance as a maker of modern America can scarcely be overstated, for\r\nthe ideas he advocated have become the very foundations of American\r\nrepublicanism. His administration ended the possibility, probability or\r\ncertainty--measure it as one will--of the development of Federalism in\r\nthe direction of class government; and the party he formed, inspired by\r\nthe creed he gave it, fixed the democratic future of the nation. And by\r\nhis own labours he had vindicated his faith in the experiment of\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\nJefferson's last years were devoted to the establishment of the\r\nuniversity of Virginia at Charlottesville, near his home. He planned the\r\nbuildings, gathered its faculty--mainly from abroad--and shaped its\r\norganization. Practically all the great ideas of aim, administration and\r\ncurriculum that dominated American universities at the end of the 19th\r\ncentury were anticipated by him. He hoped that the university might be a\r\ndominant influence in national culture, but circumstances crippled it.\r\nHis educational plans had been maturing in his mind since 1776. His\r\nfinancial affairs in these last years gave him grave concern. His fine\r\nlibrary of over 10,000 volumes was purchased at a low price by Congress\r\nin 1815, and a national contribution ($16,500) just before his death\r\nenabled him to die in peace. Though not personally extravagant, his\r\nsalary, and the small income from his large estates, never sufficed to\r\nmeet his generous maintenance of his representative position; and after\r\nhis retirement from public life the numerous visitors to Monticello\r\nconsumed the remnants of his property. He died on the 4th of July 1826,\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, on the same\r\nday as John Adams. He chose for his tomb the epitaph: \"Here was buried\r\nThomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of American Independence, of\r\nthe statute of Virginia for religious freedom, and father of the\r\nuniversity of Virginia.\"\r\n\r\n  Jefferson was about 6 ft. in height, large-boned, slim, erect and\r\n  sinewy. He had angular features, a very ruddy complexion, sandy hair,\r\n  and hazel-flecked, grey eyes. Age lessened the unattractiveness of his\r\n  exterior. In later years he was negligent in dress and loose in\r\n  bearing. There was grace, nevertheless, in his manners; and his frank\r\n  and earnest address, his quick sympathy (yet he seemed cold to\r\n  strangers), his vivacious, desultory, informing talk, gave him an\r\n  engaging charm. Beneath a quiet surface he was fairly aglow with\r\n  intense convictions and a very emotional temperament. Yet he seems to\r\n  have acted habitually, in great and little things, on system. His\r\n  mind, no less trenchant and subtle than Hamilton's, was the most\r\n  impressible, the most receptive, mind of his time in America. The\r\n  range of his interests is remarkable. For many years he was president\r\n  of the American philosophical society. Though it is a biographical\r\n  tradition that he lacked wit, Molière and _Don Quixote_ seem to have\r\n  been his favourites; and though the utilitarian wholly crowds\r\n  romanticism out of his writings, he had enough of that quality in\r\n  youth to prepare to learn Gaelic in order to translate Ossian, and\r\n  sent to Macpherson for the originals! His interest in art was\r\n  evidently intellectual. He was singularly sweet-tempered, and shrank\r\n  from the impassioned political bitterness that raged about him; bore\r\n  with relative equanimity a flood of coarse and malignant abuse of his\r\n  motives, morals, religion,[23] personal honesty and decency; cherished\r\n  very few personal animosities; and better than any of his great\r\n  antagonists cleared political opposition of ill-blooded personality.\r\n  In short, his kindness of heart rose above all social, religious or\r\n  political differences, and nothing destroyed his confidence in men and\r\n  his sanguine views of life.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--See the editions of Jefferson's _Writings_ by H.

This greatly\r\n    reduced his income for a number of years.\r\n\r\n  [2] The first law of its kind in Christendom, although not the\r\n    earliest practice of such liberty in America.\r\n\r\n  [3] George Mason and Thomas L. Lee were members of the commission,\r\n    but they were not lawyers, and did little actual work on the\r\n    revision.\r\n\r\n  [4] Capital punishment was confined to treason and murder; the former\r\n    was not to be attended by corruption of blood, drawing, or\r\n    quartering; all other felonies were made punishable by confinement\r\n    and hard labour, save a few to which was applied, against Jefferson's\r\n    desire, the principle of retaliation.\r\n\r\n  [5] This plan applied to the south-western as well as to the\r\n    north-western territory, and was notable for a provision that slavery\r\n    should not exist therein after 1800. This provision was defeated in\r\n    1784, but was adopted in 1787 for the north-western territory--a step\r\n    which is very often said to have saved the Union in the Civil War;\r\n    the south-western territory (out of which were later formed\r\n    Mississippi, Alabama, &c.) being given over to slavery. Thus the\r\n    anti-slavery clause of the ordinance of 1784 was not adopted; and it\r\n    was preceded by unofficial proposals to the same end; yet to it\r\n    belongs rightly some special honour as blazoning the way for federal\r\n    control of slavery in the territories, which later proved of such\r\n    enormous consequence. Jefferson in the first draft of the Ordinance\r\n    of 1784, suggested the names to be given to the states eventually to\r\n    be formed out of the territory concerned. For his suggestions he has\r\n    been much ridiculed. The names are as follows: Illinoia, Michigania,\r\n    Sylvania, Polypotamia, Assenisipia, Charronesus, Pelisipia, Saratoga,\r\n    Metropotamia and Washington.\r\n\r\n  [6] He owned at one time above 150 slaves. His overseers were under\r\n    contract never to bleed them; but he manumitted only a few at his\r\n    death.\r\n\r\n  [7] During this time he assisted in negotiating a treaty of amity and\r\n    commerce with Prussia (1785) and one with Morocco (1789), and\r\n    negotiated with France a \"convention defining and establishing the\r\n    functions and privileges of consuls and vice-consuls\" (1788).\r\n\r\n  [8] Patrick Henry humorously declaimed before a popular audience that\r\n    Jefferson, who favoured French wine and cookery, had \"abjured his\r\n    native victuals.\"\r\n\r\n  [9] Jefferson did not sympathize with the temper of his followers who\r\n    condoned the zealous excesses of Genet, and in general with the\r\n    \"misbehaviour\" of the democratic clubs; but, as a student of English\r\n    liberties, he could not accept Washington's doctrine that for a\r\n    self-created permanent body to declare \"this act unconstitutional,\r\n    and that act pregnant with mischiefs\" was \"a stretch of arrogant\r\n    presumption\" which would, if unchecked, \"destroy the country.\"\r\n\r\n  [10] John Basset Moore, _American Diplomacy_ (New York, 1905).\r\n\r\n  [11] Compare C. D. Hazen, _Contemporary American opinion of the\r\n    French Revolution_ (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, 1897).\r\n\r\n  [12] It was at this period of his life that Jefferson gave expression\r\n    to some of the opinions for which he has been most severely\r\n    criticized and ridiculed. For the Shays' rebellion he felt little\r\n    abhorrence, and wrote: \"A little rebellion now and then is a good\r\n    thing ... an observation of this truth should render honest\r\n    republican governors so mild in their punishment of rebellions as not\r\n    to discourage them too much. It is a medicine necessary for the sound\r\n    health of government\" (_Writings_, Ford ed., iv. 362-363). Again,\r\n    \"Can history produce an instance of rebellion so honorably\r\n    conducted?... God forbid that we should ever be twenty years without\r\n    such a rebellion.... What signify a few lives lost in a century or\r\n    two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the\r\n    blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure\" (Ibid. iv.\r\n    467). Again he says: \"Societies exist under three forms--(1) without\r\n    government, as among our Indians; (2) under governments wherein the\r\n    will of every one has a just influence.... (3) under governments of\r\n    force.... It is a problem not clear in my mind that the first\r\n    condition is not the best.\" (Ibid. iv. 362.)\r\n\r\n  [13] He turned law students from Blackstone's toryism to Coke on\r\n    Littleton; and he would not read Walter Scott, so strong was his\r\n    aversion to that writer's predilection for class and feudalism.\r\n\r\n  [14] Hamilton wrote for the papers himself; Jefferson never did. A\r\n    talented clerk in his department, however, Philip Freneau, set up an\r\n    anti-administration paper. It was alleged that Jefferson appointed\r\n    him for the purpose, and encouraged him. Undoubtedly there was\r\n    nothing in the charge. The Federalist outcry could only have been\r\n    silenced by removal of Freneau, or by disclaimers or admonitions,\r\n    which Jefferson did not think it incumbent upon himself--or, since he\r\n    thought Freneau was doing good, desirable for him--to make.\r\n\r\n  [15] Contrary to the general belief that Hamilton dominated\r\n    Washington in the cabinet, there is the president's explicit\r\n    statement that \"there were as many instances\" of his deciding against\r\n    as in favour of the secretary of the treasury.\r\n\r\n  [16] See also Jefferson to E. Gerry, 26th of January 1799\r\n    (_Writings_, vii. 325), and to Dupont de Nemours (x. 23). Cf.\r\n    Hamilton to J. Dayton, 1799 (_Works_, x. 329).\r\n\r\n  [17] In 1786 he suggested to James Monroe that the society of friends\r\n    he hoped to gather in Albemarle might, in sumptuary matters, \"set a\r\n    good example\" to a country (i.e. Virginia) that \"needed\" it.\r\n\r\n  [18] See C. R. Fish, _The Civil Service and the Patronage_ (Harvard\r\n    Historical Studies, New York, 1905), ch. 2.\r\n\r\n  [19] Jefferson's dislike of a navy was due to his desire for an\r\n    economical administration and for peace. Shortly after his\r\n    inauguration he expressed a desire to lay up the larger men of war in\r\n    the eastern branch of the Potomac, where they would require only \"one\r\n    set of plunderers to take care of them.\" To Thomas Paine he wrote in\r\n    1807: \"I believe that gunboats are the only _water_ defence which can\r\n    be useful to us and protect us from the ruinous folly of a navy.\"\r\n    (_Works_, Ford ed., ix. 137.) The gunboats desired by Jefferson were\r\n    small, cheap craft equipped with one or two guns and kept on shore\r\n    under sheds until actually needed, when they were to be launched and\r\n    manned by a sort of naval militia. A large number of these boats were\r\n    constructed and they afforded some protection to coasting vessels\r\n    against privateers, but in bad weather, or when employed against a\r\n    frigate, they were worse than useless, and Jefferson's \"gunboat\r\n    system\" was admittedly a failure.\r\n\r\n  [20] See e.g. his letters in 1787 on the Shays' rebellion, and his\r\n    speculations on the doctrine that one generation may not bind another\r\n    by paper documents. With the latter may be compared present-day\r\n    movements like the initiative and referendum, and not a few\r\n    discussions of national debts. Jefferson's distrust of governments\r\n    was nothing exceptional for a consistent individualist.\r\n\r\n  [21] In his last years he carefully sifted and revised his\r\n    contemporary notes evidencing, as he believed, the existence of such\r\n    a party, and they remain as his _Ana_ (chiefly Hamiltoniana). The\r\n    only just judgment of these notes is to be obtained by looking at\r\n    them, and by testing his suspicions with the letters of Hamilton,\r\n    Ames, Oliver Wolcott, Theodore Sedgwick, George Cabot and the other\r\n    Hamiltonians. Such a comparison measures also the relative judgment,\r\n    temper and charity of these writers and Jefferson. It must still\r\n    remain true, however, that Jefferson's _Ana_ present him in a far\r\n    from engaging light.\r\n\r\n  [22] \"Jefferson, in 1789, wrote some such stuff about the will of\r\n    majorities, as a New Englander would lose his rank among men of sense\r\n    to avow.\"--Fisher Ames (Jan. 1800).\r\n\r\n  [23] He was classed as a \"French infidel\" and atheist. His attitude\r\n    toward religion was in fact deeply reverent and sincere, but he\r\n    insisted that religion was purely an individual matter, \"evidenced,\r\n    as concerns the world by each one's daily life,\" and demanded\r\n    absolute freedom of private judgment. He looked on Unitarianism with\r\n    much sympathy and desired its growth. \"I am a Christian,\" he wrote in\r\n    1823, \"in the only sense in which he (Jesus) wished any one to be;\r\n    sincerely attached to his doctrines in preference to all others;\r\n    ascribing to himself every human excellence, and believing he never\r\n    claimed any other.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEFFERSON CITY (legally and officially the City of Jefferson), the\r\ncapital of Missouri, U.S.A., and the county-seat of Cole county, on the\r\nMissouri river, near the geographical centre of the state, about 125 m.\r\nW. of St Louis. Pop. (1890), 6742; (1900), 9664, of whom 786 were\r\nforeign-born and 1822 were negroes; (1910 census), 11,850. It is served\r\nby the Missouri Pacific, the Chicago & Alton, and the Missouri, Kansas &\r\nTexas railways. Its site is partly in the bottom-lands of the river and\r\npartly on the steep banks at an elevation of about 600 ft. above the\r\nsea. A steel bridge spans the river. The state capitol, an imposing\r\nstructure built on a bluff above the river, was built in 1838-1842 and\r\nenlarged in 1887-1888; it was first occupied in 1840 by the legislature,\r\nwhich previously had met (after 1837) in the county court house. Other\r\nprominent buildings are the United States court house and post office,\r\nthe state supreme court house, the county court house, the state\r\npenitentiary, the state armoury and the executive mansion. The\r\npenitentiary is to a large extent self-supporting; in 1903-1904 the\r\nearnings were $3493.80 in excess of the costs, but in 1904-1906 the\r\ncosts exceeded the earnings by $9044. Employment is furnished for the\r\nconvicts on the penitentiary premises by incorporated companies. The\r\nstate law library here is one of the best of the kind in the country,\r\nand the city has a public library. In the city is Lincoln Institute, a\r\nschool for negroes, founded in 1866 by two regiments of negro infantry\r\nupon their discharge from the United States army, opened in 1868, taken\r\nover by the state in 1879, and having sub-normal, normal, college,\r\nindustrial and agricultural courses. Coal and limestone are found near\r\nthe city. In 1905 the total value of the factory product was $3,926,632,\r\nan increase of 28.2% since 1900. The original constitution of Missouri\r\nprescribed that the capital should be on the Missouri river within 40 m.\r\nof the mouth of the Osage, and a commission selected in 1821 the site of\r\nJefferson City, on which a town was laid out in 1822, the name being\r\nadopted in honour of Thomas Jefferson. The legislature first met here in\r\n1826; Jefferson City became the county-seat in 1828, and in 1839 was\r\nfirst chartered as a city. The constitutional conventions of 1845 and\r\n1875, and the state convention which issued the call for the National\r\nLiberal Republican convention at Cincinnati in 1872, met here, and so\r\nfor some of its sessions did the state convention of 1861-1863. In June\r\n1861 Jefferson City was occupied by Union forces, and in\r\nSeptember-October 1864 it was threatened by Confederate troops under\r\nGeneral Sterling Price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEFFERSONVILLE, a city and the county-seat of Clark county, Indiana,\r\nU.S.A., situated on the N. bank of the Ohio river, opposite Louisville,\r\nKentucky, with which it is connected by several bridges. Pop. (1890),\r\n10,666; (1900), 10,774, of whom 1818 were of negro descent and 615 were\r\nforeign-born; (1910 census), 10,412. It is served by the Baltimore &\r\nOhio South-western, the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St Louis, and\r\nthe Pittsburg, Cincinnati, Chicago & St Louis railways, and by three\r\ninter-urban electric lines. It is attractively situated on bluffs above\r\nthe river, which at this point has a descent (known as the falls of the\r\nOhio) of 26 ft. in 2 m. This furnishes good water power for\r\nmanufacturing purposes both at Jeffersonville and at Louisville. The\r\ntotal value of the factory product in 1905 was $4,526,443, an increase\r\nof 20% since 1900. The Indiana reformatory (formerly the Southern\r\nIndiana penitentiary) and a large supply dépôt of the United States army\r\nare at Jeffersonville. General George Rogers Clark started (June 24,\r\n1778) on his expedition against Kaskaskia and Vincennes from Corn Island\r\n(now completely washed away) opposite what is now Jeffersonville. In\r\n1786 the United States government established Fort Finney (built by\r\nCaptain Walter Finney), afterwards re-named Fort Steuben, on the site of\r\nthe present city; but the fort was abandoned in 1791, and the actual\r\nbeginning of Jeffersonville was in 1802, when a part of the Clark grant\r\n(the site of the present city) was transferred by its original owner,\r\nLieut. Isaac Bowman, to three trustees, under whose direction a town was\r\nlaid out. Jeffersonville was incorporated as a town in 1815, and was\r\nchartered as a city in 1839.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEFFREY, FRANCIS JEFFREY, LORD (1773-1850), Scottish judge and literary\r\ncritic, son of a depute-clerk in the Court of Session, was born at\r\nEdinburgh on the 23rd of October 1773. After attending the high school\r\nfor six years, he studied at the university of Glasgow from 1787 to May\r\n1789, and at Queen's College, Oxford, from September 1791 to June 1792.\r\nHe had begun the study of law at Edinburgh before going to Oxford, and\r\nnow resumed his studies there. He became a member of the speculative\r\nsociety, where he measured himself in debate with Scott, Brougham,\r\nFrancis Horner, the marquess of Lansdowne, Lord Kinnaird and others. He\r\nwas admitted to the Scotch bar in December 1794, but, having abandoned\r\nthe Tory principles in which he had been educated, he found that his\r\nWhig politics seriously prejudiced his legal prospects. In consequence\r\nof his lack of success at the bar he went to London in 1798 to try his\r\nfortune as a journalist, but without success; he also made more than one\r\nvain attempt to obtain an office which would have secured him the\r\nadvantage of a small but fixed salary. His marriage with Catherine\r\nWilson in 1801 made the question of a settled income even more pressing.\r\nA project for a new review was brought forward by Sydney Smith in\r\nJeffrey's flat in the presence of H. P. Brougham (afterwards Lord\r\nBrougham), Francis Horner and others; and the scheme resulted in the\r\nappearance on the 10th of October 1802 of the first number of the\r\n_Edinburgh Review_. At the outset the _Review_ was not under the charge\r\nof any special editor. The first three numbers were, however,\r\npractically edited by Sydney Smith, and on his leaving for England the\r\nwork devolved chiefly on Jeffrey, who, by an arrangement with Constable,\r\nthe publisher, was eventually appointed editor at a fixed salary. Most\r\nof those associated in the undertaking were Whigs; but, although the\r\ngeneral bias of the Review was towards social and political reforms, it\r\nwas at first so little of a party organ that for a time it numbered Sir\r\nWalter Scott among its contributors; and no distinct emphasis was given\r\nto its political leanings until the publication in 1808 of an article by\r\nJeffrey himself on the work of Don Pedro Cevallos on the _French\r\nUsurpation of Spain_. This article expressed despair of the success of\r\nthe British arms in Spain, and Scott at once withdrew his subscription,\r\nthe _Quarterly_ being soon afterwards started in opposition. According\r\nto Lord Cockburn the effect of the first number of the _Edinburgh\r\nReview_ was \"electrical.\" The English reviews were at that time\r\npractically publishers' organs, the articles in which were written by\r\nhackwriters instructed to praise or blame according to the publishers'\r\ninterests. Few men of any standing consented to write for them. The\r\n_Edinburgh Review_, on the other hand, enlisted a brilliant and\r\nindependent staff of contributors, guided by the editor, not the\r\npublisher. They received sixteen guineas a sheet (sixteen printed\r\npages), increased subsequently to twenty-five guineas in many cases,\r\ninstead of the two guineas which formed the ordinary London reviewer's\r\nfee. Further, the review was not limited to literary criticism. It\r\nconstituted itself the accredited organ of moderate Whig public opinion.\r\nThe particular work which provided the starting-point of an article was\r\nin many cases merely the occasion for the exposition, always brilliant\r\nand incisive, of the author's views on politics, social subjects, ethics\r\nor literature. These general principles and the novelty of the method\r\nensured the success of the undertaking even after the original circle of\r\nexceptionally able men who founded it had been dispersed. It had a\r\ncirculation, great for those days, of 12,000 copies. The period of\r\nJeffrey's editorship extended to about twenty-six years, ceasing with\r\nthe ninety-eighth number, published in June 1829, when he resigned in\r\nfavour of Macvey Napier.\r\n\r\nJeffrey's own contributions, according to a list which has the sanction\r\nof his authority, numbered two hundred, all except six being written\r\nbefore his resignation of the editorship. Jeffrey wrote with great\r\nrapidity, at odd moments of leisure and with little special preparation.\r\nGreat fluency and ease of diction, considerable warmth of imagination\r\nand moral sentiment, and a sharp eye to discover any oddity of style or\r\nviolation of the accepted canons of good taste, made his criticisms\r\npungent and effective. But the essential narrowness and timidity of his\r\ngeneral outlook prevented him from detecting and estimating latent\r\nforces, either in politics or in matters strictly intellectual and\r\nmoral; and this lack of understanding and sympathy accounts for his\r\ndistrust and dislike of the passion and fancy of Shelley and Keats, and\r\nfor his praise of the half-hearted and elegant romanticism of Rogers and\r\nCampbell. (For his treatment of the lake poets see WORDSWORTH, WILLIAM.)\r\n\r\nA criticism in the fifteenth number of the _Review_ on the morality of\r\nMoore's poems led in 1806 to a duel between the two authors at Chalk\r\nFarm. The proceedings were stopped by the police, and Jeffrey's pistol\r\nwas found to contain no bullet. The affair led to a warm friendship,\r\nhowever, and Moore contributed to the _Review_, while Jeffrey made ample\r\namends in a later article on _Lalla Rookh_ (1817).\r\n\r\nJeffrey's wife had died in 1805, and in 1810 he became acquainted with\r\nCharlotte, daughter of Charles Wilkes of New York, and great-niece of\r\nJohn Wilkes. When she returned to America, Jeffrey followed her, and\r\nthey were married in 1813. Before returning to England they visited\r\nseveral of the chief American cities, and his experience strengthened\r\nJeffrey in the conciliatory policy he had before advocated towards the\r\nStates. Notwithstanding the increasing success of the _Review_, Jeffrey\r\nalways continued to look to the bar as the chief field of his ambition.\r\nAs a matter of fact, his literary reputation helped his professional\r\nadvancement. His practice extended rapidly in the civil and criminal\r\ncourts, and he regularly appeared before the general assembly of the\r\nChurch of Scotland, where his work, though not financially profitable,\r\nincreased his reputation. As an advocate his sharpness and rapidity of\r\ninsight gave him a formidable advantage in the detection of the\r\nweaknesses of a witness and the vulnerable points of his opponent's\r\ncase, while he grouped his own arguments with an admirable eye to\r\neffect, especially excelling in eloquent closing appeals to a jury.\r\nJeffrey was twice, in 1820 and 1822, elected lord rector of the\r\nuniversity of Glasgow. In 1829 he was chosen dean of the faculty of\r\nadvocates. On the return of the Whigs to power in 1830 he became lord\r\nadvocate, and entered parliament as member for the Perth burghs. He was\r\nunseated, and afterwards returned for Malton, a borough in the interest\r\nof Lord Fitzwilliam. After the passing of the Scottish Reform Bill,\r\nwhich he introduced in parliament, he was returned for Edinburgh in\r\nDecember 1832. His parliamentary career, which, though not brilliantly\r\nsuccessful, had won him high general esteem, was terminated by his\r\nelevation to the judicial bench as Lord Jeffrey in May 1834. In 1842 he\r\nwas moved to the first division of the Court of Session. On the\r\ndisruption of the Scottish Church he took the side of the seceders,\r\ngiving a judicial opinion in their favour, afterwards reversed by the\r\nhouse of lords. He died at Edinburgh on the 26th of January 1850.\r\n\r\n  Some of his contributions to the _Edinburgh Review_ appeared in four\r\n  volumes in 1844 and 1845. This selection includes the essay on\r\n  \"Beauty\" contributed to the _Ency. Brit._ The _Life of Lord Jeffrey,\r\n  with a Selection from his Correspondence_, by Lord Cockburn, appeared\r\n  in 1852 in 2 vols. See also the _Selected Correspondence of Macvey\r\n  Napier_ (1877); the sketch of Jeffrey in Carlyle's _Reminiscences_,\r\n  vol. ii. (1881); and an essay by Lewis E. Gates in _Three Studies in\r\n  Literature_ (New York, 1899).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEFFREYS, GEORGE JEFFREYS, 1ST BARON (1648-1689), lord chancellor of\r\nEngland, son of John Jeffreys, a Welsh country gentleman, was born at\r\nActon Park, his father's seat in Denbighshire, in 1648. His family,\r\nthough not wealthy, was of good social standing and repute in Wales; his\r\nmother, a daughter of Sir Thomas Ireland of Bewsey, Lancashire, was \"a\r\nvery pious good woman.\" He was educated at Shrewsbury, St Paul's and\r\nWestminster schools, at the last of which he was a pupil of Busby, and\r\nat Trinity College, Cambridge; but he left the university without taking\r\na degree, and entered the Inner Temple as a student in May 1663. From\r\nhis childhood Jeffreys displayed exceptional talent, but on coming to\r\nLondon he occupied himself more with the pleasures of conviviality than\r\nwith serious study of the law. Though he never appears to have fallen\r\ninto the licentious immorality prevalent at that period, he early became\r\naddicted to hard drinking and boisterous company. But as the records of\r\nhis early years, and indeed of his whole life, are derived almost\r\nexclusively from vehemently hostile sources, the numerous anecdotes of\r\nhis depravity cannot be accepted without a large measure of scepticism.\r\nHe was a handsome, witty and attractive boon-companion, and in the\r\ntaverns of the city he made friends among attorneys with practice in the\r\ncriminal courts. Thus assisted he rose so rapidly in his profession that\r\nwithin three years of his call to the bar in 1668, he was elected common\r\nserjeant of the city of London. Such advancement, however, was not to be\r\nattained even in the reign of Charles II. solely by the aid of\r\ndisreputable friendships. Jeffreys had remarkable aptitude for the\r\nprofession of an advocate--quick intelligence, caustic humour, copious\r\neloquence. His powers of cross-examination were masterly; and if he was\r\ninsufficiently grounded in legal principles to become a profound lawyer,\r\nnothing but greater application was needed in the opinion of so hostile\r\na critic as Lord Campbell, to have made him the rival of Nottingham and\r\nHale. Jeffreys could count on the influence of respectable men of\r\nposition in the city, such as Sir Robert Clayton and his own namesake\r\nAlderman Jeffreys; and he also enjoyed the personal friendship of the\r\nvirtuous Sir Matthew Hale. In 1667 Jeffreys had married in circumstances\r\nwhich, if improvident, were creditable to his generosity and sense of\r\nhonour; and his domestic life, so far as is known, was free from the\r\nscandal common among his contemporaries. While holding the judicial\r\noffice of common serjeant, he pursued his practice at the bar. With a\r\nview to further preferment he now sought to ingratiate himself with the\r\ncourt party, to which he obtained an introduction possibly through\r\nWilliam Chiffinch, the notorious keeper of the king's closet. He at once\r\nattached himself to the king's mistress, the duchess of Portsmouth; and\r\nas early as 1672 he was employed in confidential business by the court.\r\nHis influence in the city of London, where opposition to the government\r\nof Charles II. was now becoming pronounced, enabled Jeffreys to make\r\nhimself useful to Danby. In September 1677 he received a knighthood, and\r\nhis growing favour with the court was further marked by his appointment\r\nas solicitor-general to James, duke of York; while the city showed its\r\ncontinued confidence in him by electing him to the post of recorder in\r\nOctober 1678.\r\n\r\nIn the previous month Titus Oates had made his first revelations of the\r\nalleged popish plot, and from this time forward Jeffreys was prominently\r\nidentified, either as advocate or judge, with the memorable state trials\r\nby which the political conflict between the Crown and the people was\r\nwaged during the remainder of the 17th century. The popish plot,\r\nfollowed by the growing agitation for the exclusion of the duke of York\r\nfrom the succession, widened the breach between the city and the court.\r\nJeffreys threw in his lot with the latter, displaying his zeal by\r\ninitiating the movement of the \"abhorrers\" (q.v.) against the\r\n\"petitioners\" who were giving voice to the popular demand for the\r\nsummoning of parliament. He was rewarded with the coveted office of\r\nchief justice of Chester on the 30th of April 1680; but when parliament\r\nmet in October the House of Commons passed a hostile resolution which\r\ninduced him to resign his recordership, a piece of pusillanimity that\r\ndrew from the king the remark that Jeffreys was \"not parliament-proof.\"\r\nJeffreys nevertheless received from the city aldermen a substantial\r\ntoken of appreciation for his past services. In 1681 he was created a\r\nbaronet. In June 1683 the first of the Rye House conspirators were\r\nbrought to trial. Jeffreys was briefed for the crown in the prosecution\r\nof Lord William Howard; and, having been raised to the bench as lord\r\nchief justice of the king's bench in September, he presided at the\r\ntrials of Algernon Sidney in November 1683 and of Sir Thomas Armstrong\r\nin the following June. In the autumn of 1684 Jeffreys, who had been\r\nactive in procuring the surrender of municipal charters to the crown,\r\nwas called to the cabinet, having previously been sworn of the privy\r\ncouncil. In May 1685 he had the satisfaction of passing sentence on\r\nTitus Oates for perjury in the plot trials; and about the same time\r\nJames II. rewarded his zeal with a peerage as Baron Jeffreys of Wem, an\r\nhonour never before conferred on a chief justice during his tenure of\r\noffice. Jeffreys had for some time been suffering from stone, which\r\naggravated the irritability of his naturally violent temper; and the\r\nmalady probably was in some degree the cause of the unmeasured fury he\r\ndisplayed at the trial of Richard Baxter (q.v.) for seditious libel--if\r\nthe unofficial _ex parte_ report of the trial, which alone exists, is to\r\nbe accepted as trustworthy.\r\n\r\nIn August 1685 Jeffreys opened at Winchester the commission known in\r\nhistory as the \"bloody assizes,\" his conduct of which has branded his\r\nname with indelible infamy. The number of persons sentenced to death at\r\nthese assizes for complicity in the duke of Monmouth's insurrection is\r\nuncertain. The official return of those actually executed was 320; many\r\nhundreds more were transported and sold into slavery in the West Indies.\r\nIn all probability the great majority of those condemned were in fact\r\nconcerned in the rising, but the trials were in many cases a mockery of\r\nthe administration of justice. Numbers were cajoled into pleading\r\nguilty; the case for the prisoners seldom obtained a hearing. The\r\nmerciless severity of the chief justice did not however exceed the\r\nwishes of James II.; for on his return to London Jeffreys received from\r\nthe king the great seal with the title of lord chancellor. For the next\r\ntwo years he was a strenuous upholder of prerogative, though he was less\r\nabjectly pliant than has sometimes been represented. There is no reason\r\nto doubt the sincerity of his attachment to the Church of England; for\r\nalthough the king's favour was capricious Jeffreys never took the easy\r\nand certain path to secure it that lay through apostasy; and he even\r\nwithstood James on occasion, when the latter pushed his Catholic zeal to\r\nextremes. Though it is true that he accepted the presidency of the\r\necclesiastical commission, Burnet's statement that it was Jeffreys who\r\nsuggested that institution to James is probably incorrect; and he was so\r\nfar from having instigated the prosecution of the seven bishops in 1688,\r\nas has been frequently alleged, that he disapproved of the proceedings\r\nand rejoiced secretly at the acquittal. But while he watched with\r\nmisgiving the king's preferment of Roman Catholics, he made himself the\r\nmasterful instrument of unconstitutional prerogative in coercing the\r\nauthorities of Cambridge University, who in 1687 refused to confer\r\ndegrees on a Benedictine monk, and the fellows of Magdalen College,\r\nOxford, who declined to elect as their president a disreputable nominee\r\nof the king.\r\n\r\nBeing thus conspicuously identified with the most tyrannical measures of\r\nJames II., Jeffreys found himself in a desperate plight when on the 11th\r\nof December 1688 the king fled from the country on the approach to\r\nLondon of William of Orange. The lord chancellor attempted to escape\r\nlike his master; but in spite of his disguise as a common seaman he was\r\nrecognized in a tavern at Wapping--possibly, as Roger North relates, by\r\nan attorney whom Jeffreys had terrified on some occasion in the court of\r\nchancery--and was arrested and conveyed to the Tower. The malady from\r\nwhich he had long suffered had recently made fatal progress, and he died\r\nin the Tower on the 18th of April 1689. He was succeeded in the peerage\r\nby his son, John (2nd Baron Jeffreys of Wem), who died without male\r\nissue in 1702, when the title became extinct.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to determine precisely with what justice tradition has\r\nmade the name of \"Judge Jeffreys\" a byword of infamy. The Revolution,\r\nwhich brought about his fall, handed over his reputation at the same\r\ntime to the mercy of his bitterest enemies. They alone have recorded his\r\nactions and appraised his motives and character. Even the adherents of\r\nthe deposed dynasty had no interest in finding excuse for one who served\r\nas a convenient scapegoat for the offences of his master. For at least\r\nhalf a century after his death no apology for Lord Jeffreys would have\r\nobtained a hearing; and none was attempted. With the exception therefore\r\nof what is to be gathered from the reports of the state trials, all\r\nknowledge of his conduct rests on testimony tainted by undisguised\r\nhostility. Innumerable scurrilous lampoons vilifying the hated\r\ninstrument of James's tyranny, but without a pretence of historic value,\r\nflooded the country at the Revolution; and these, while they fanned the\r\nundiscriminating hatred of contemporaries who remembered the judge's\r\nseverities, and perpetuated that hatred in tradition, have not been\r\nsufficiently discounted even by modern historians like Macaulay and Lord\r\nCampbell. The name of Jeffreys has therefore been handed down as that of\r\na coarse, ignorant, dissolute, foul-mouthed, inhuman bully, who\r\nprostituted the seat of justice. That there was sufficient ground for\r\nthe execration in which his memory was long held is not to be gainsaid.\r\nBut the portrait has nevertheless been blackened overmuch. An occasional\r\nsignificant admission in his favour may be gleaned even from the\r\nwritings of his enemies. Thus Roger North declares that \"in matters\r\nindifferent,\" i.e. where politics were not concerned, Jeffreys became\r\nthe seat of justice better than any other that author had seen in his\r\nplace. Sir J. Jekyll, master of the rolls, told Speaker Onslow that\r\nJeffreys \"had great parts and made a great chancellor in the business of\r\nhis court. In mere private matters he was thought an able and upright\r\njudge wherever he sat.\" His keen sense of humour, allied with a spirit\r\nof inveterate mockery and an exuberant command of pungent eloquence, led\r\nhim to rail and storm at prisoners and witnesses in grossly unseemly\r\nfashion. But in this he did not greatly surpass most of his\r\ncontemporaries on the judicial bench, and it was a failing from which\r\neven the dignified and virtuous Hale was not altogether exempt. The\r\nintemperance of Jeffreys which shocked North, certainly did not exceed\r\nthat of Saunders; in violence he was rivalled by Scroggs; though accused\r\nof political apostasy, he was not a shameless renegade like Williams;\r\nand there is no evidence that in pecuniary matters he was personally\r\nvenal, or that in licentiousness he followed the example set by Charles\r\nII. and most of his courtiers. Some of his actions that have incurred\r\nthe sternest reprobation of posterity were otherwise estimated by the\r\nbest of his contemporaries. His trial of Algernon Sidney, described by\r\nMacaulay and Lord Campbell as one of the most heinous of his iniquities,\r\nwas warmly commended by Dr William Lloyd, who was soon afterwards to\r\nbecome a popular idol as one of the illustrious seven bishops (see\r\nletter from the bishop of St Asaph in H. B. Irving's _Life of Judge\r\nJeffreys_, p. 184). Nor was the habitual illegality of his procedure on\r\nthe bench so unquestionable as many writers have assumed. Sir James\r\nStephen inclined to the opinion that no actual abuse of law tainted the\r\ntrials of the Rye House conspirators, or that of Alice Lisle, the most\r\nprominent victim of the \"bloody assizes.\" The conduct of the judges in\r\nRussell's trial was, he thinks, \"moderate and fair in general\"; and the\r\ntrial of Sidney \"much resembled that of Russell.\" The same high\r\nauthority pronounces that the trial of Lord Delamere in the House of\r\nLords was conducted by Jeffreys \"with propriety and dignity.\" And if\r\nJeffreys judged political offenders with cruel severity, he also crushed\r\nsome glaring abuses; conspicuous examples of which were the frauds of\r\nattorneys who infested Westminster Hall, and the systematic kidnapping\r\npractised by the municipal authorities of Bristol. Moreover, if any\r\nvalue is to be attached to the evidence of physiognomy, the traditional\r\nestimate of the character of Jeffreys obtains no confirmation from the\r\nrefinement of his features and expression as depicted in Kneller's\r\nportrait in the National Portrait Gallery of London. But even though the\r\npopular notion requires to be thus modified in certain respects, it\r\nremains incontestable that Jeffreys was probably on the whole the worst\r\nexample of a period when the administration of justice in England had\r\nsunk to the lowest degradation, and the judicial bench had become the\r\ntoo willing tool of an unconstitutional and unscrupulous executive.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--The chief contemporary authorities for the life of\r\n  Jeffreys are Bishop Burnet's _History of my own Time_ (1724), and see\r\n  especially the edition \"with notes by the Earls of Dartmouth and\r\n  Hardwick Speaker Onslow and Dean Swift\" (Oxford Univ. Press, 1833);\r\n  Roger North's _Life of the Right Hon.

Most of these works, and especially those by Macaulay and\r\n  Campbell, are uncritical in their hostility to Jeffreys, and are based\r\n  for the most part on untrustworthy authorities.

He came to the throne at the age of eighteen in the midst of the\r\nChaldean invasion of Judah, and is said to have reigned three months. He\r\nwas compelled to surrender to Nebuchadrezzar and was carried off to\r\nBabylon (597 B.C.). This was the First Captivity, and from it Ezekiel\r\n(one of the exiles) dates his prophecies. Eight thousand people of the\r\nbetter class (including artisans, &c.) were removed, the Temple was\r\npartially despoiled (see Jer. xxvii. 18-20; xxiii.v. 3 seq.),[1] and\r\nJehoiachin's uncle Mattaniah (son of Josiah) was appointed king.\r\nJehoiachin's fate is outlined in Jer. xxii. 20-30 (cf. xxvii. 20).\r\nNearly forty years later, Nebuchadrezzar II. died (562 B.C.) and\r\nEvil-Merodach (Amil-Marduk) his successor released the unfortunate\r\ncaptive and gave him precedence over the other subjugated kings who were\r\nkept prisoners in Babylon. With this gleam of hope for the unhappy\r\nJudaeans both the book of Kings and the prophecies of Jeremiah conclude\r\n(2 Kings xxv. 27-30; Jer. lii. 31-34).\r\n\r\n  See, further, JEREMIAH (especially chaps. xxiv., xxvii. seq.), and\r\n  JEWS, § 17.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] 2 Kings xxiv. 13 seq. gives other numbers and a view of the\r\n    disaster which is more suitable for the Second Captivity. (See\r\n    ZEDEKIAH.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEHOIAKIM (Heb. \"Yah[weh] raiseth up\"), in the Bible, son of Josiah\r\n(q.v.) and king of Judah (2 Kings xxiii. 34-xxiv. 6). On the defeat of\r\nJosiah at Megiddo his younger brother Jehoahaz (or Shallum) was chosen\r\nby the Judaeans, but the Egyptian conquerer Necho summoned him to his\r\nheadquarters at Riblah (south of Hamath on the Orontes) and removed him\r\nto Egypt, appointing in his stead Eliakim, whose name (\"El [God] raiseth\r\nup\") was changed to its better-known synonym, Jehoiakim. For a time\r\nJehoiakim remained under the protection of Necho and paid heavy tribute;\r\nbut with the rise of the new Chaldean Empire under Nebuchadrezzar II.,\r\nand the overthrow of Egypt at the battle of Carchemish (605 B.C.) a\r\nvital change occurred. After three years of allegiance the king\r\nrevolted. Invasions followed by Chaldeans, Syrians, Moabites and\r\nAmmonites, perhaps the advance troops despatched by the Babylonian\r\nking; the power of Egypt was broken and the whole land came into the\r\nhands of Nebuchadrezzar. It was at the close of Jehoiakim's reign,\r\napparently just before his death, that the enemy appeared at the gates\r\nof Jerusalem, and although he himself \"slept with his fathers\" his young\r\nson was destined to see the first captivity of the land of Judah (597\r\nB.C.). (See JEHOIACHIN.)\r\n\r\n  Which \"three years\" (2 Kings xxiv. 1) are intended is disputed; it is\r\n  uncertain whether Judah suffered in 605 B.C. (Berossus in Jos. _c.\r\n  Ap._ i. 19) or was left unharmed (Jos. _Ant._ x. 6. 1); perhaps\r\n  Nebuchadrezzar made his first inroad against Judah in 602 B.C. because\r\n  of its intrigue with Egypt (H. Winckler, _Keilinschrift. u. d. alte\r\n  Test._, pp. 107 seq.), and the three years of allegiance extends to\r\n  599. The chronicler's tradition (2 Chron. xxxvi. 5-8) speaks of\r\n  Jehoiakim's captivity, apparently confusing him with Jehoiachin. The\r\n  Septuagint, however, still preserves there the record of his peaceful\r\n  death, in agreement with the earlier source in 2 Kings, but against\r\n  the prophecy of Jeremiah (xxii. 18 seq., xxxvi. 30), which is accepted\r\n  by Jos. _Ant._ x. 6. 3. The different traditions can scarcely be\r\n  reconciled. Nothing certain is known of the marauding bands sent\r\n  against Jehoiakim; for Syrians (_Aram_) one would expect Edomites\r\n  (_Edom_), but see Jer. xxxv. 11; some recensions of the Septuagint\r\n  even include the \"Samaritans\"!

It is a flourishing town, and consists of one great\r\nstreet, about 2 m. long, with smaller streets radiating in all\r\ndirections. The people are well-to-do and there are some fine shops. The\r\npalace, called Pi-shu-shan-chuang, or \"mountain lodge for avoiding\r\nheat,\" was built in 1703 on the plan of the palace of Yuen-ming-yuen\r\nnear Peking. A substantial brick wall 6 m. in circuit encloses several\r\nwell-wooded heights and extensive gardens, rockeries, pavilions,\r\ntemples, &c. Jehol was visited by Lord Macartney on his celebrated\r\nmission to the emperor K'ienlung in 1793; and it was to Jehol that the\r\nemperor Hienfeng retired when the allied armies of England and France\r\noccupied Peking in 1860. In the vicinity of Jehol are numerous Lama\r\nmonasteries and temples, the most remarkable being Potala-su, built on\r\nthe model of the palace of the grand lama of Tibet at Potala.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEHORAM, or JORAM (Heb. \"Yah[weh] is high\"), the name of two Biblical\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\n1. The son of Ahab, and king of Israel in succession to his brother\r\nAhaziah.[1] He maintained close relations with Judah, whose king came to\r\nhis assistance against Moab which had revolted after Ahab's death (2\r\nKings i. 1; iii.). The king in question is said to have been\r\nJehoshaphat; but, according to Lucian's recension, it was Ahaziah,\r\nwhilst i. 17 would show that it was Jehoram's namesake (see 2). The\r\nresult of the campaign appears to have been a defeat for Israel (see on\r\nthe incidents EDOM, ELISHA, MOAB). The prophetical party were throughout\r\nhostile to Jehoram (with his reform iii. 2 contrast x. 27), and the\r\nsingular account of the war of Benhadad king of Syria against the king\r\nof Israel (vi. 24-vii.) shows the feeling against the reigning dynasty.\r\nBut whether the incidents in which Elisha and the unnamed king of Israel\r\nappear originally belonged to the time of Jehoram is very doubtful, and\r\nin view of the part which Elisha took in securing the accession of Jehu,\r\nit has been urged with much force that they belong to the dynasty of the\r\nlatter, when the high position of the prophet would be perfectly\r\nnatural.[2] The briefest account is given of Jehoram's alliance with\r\nAhaziah (son of 2 below) against Hazael of Syria, at Ramoth-Gilead (2\r\nKings viii. 25-29), and the incident--with the wounding of the Israelite\r\nking in or about the critical year 842 B.C.--finds a noteworthy parallel\r\nin the time of Jehoshaphat and Ahab (1 Kings xxii. 29-36) at the period\r\nof the equally momentous events in 854 (see AHAB). See further JEHU.\r\n\r\n2. The son of Jehoshaphat and king of Judah. He married Athaliah the\r\ndaughter of Ahab, and thus was brother-in-law of 1. above, and\r\ncontemporary with him (2 Kings i. 17). In his days Edom revolted, and\r\nthis with the mention of Libnah's revolt (2 Kings viii. 20 sqq.)\r\nsuggests some common action on the part of Philistines and Edomites. The\r\nchronicler's account of his life (2 Chron. xxi-xxii. 1) presupposes\r\nthis, but adds many remarkable details: he began his reign by massacring\r\nhis brethren (cf. Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, and his bloodshed, 2 Kings\r\nix. seq.); for his wickedness he received a communication from Elijah\r\nforetelling his death from disease (cf. Elijah and Ahaziah of Israel, 2\r\nKings i.); in a great invasion of Philistines and Arabian tribes he lost\r\nall his possessions and family, and only Jehoahaz (i.e. Ahaziah) was\r\nsaved.[3] His son Ahaziah reigned only for a year (cf. his namesake of\r\nIsrael); he is condemned for his Israelite sympathies, and met his end\r\nin the general butchery which attended the accession of Jehu (2 Kings\r\nviii. 25 sqq.; 2 Chron. xxii. 3 seq., 7; with 2 Kings ix. 27 seq., note\r\nthe variant tradition in 2 Chron. xxii. 8 seq., and the details which\r\nthe LXX. (Lucian) appends to 2 Kings x.).     (S. A. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] 2 Kings i. 17 seq.; see Lucian's reading (cf. Vulg. and Pesh.).\r\n    Apart from the allusion 1 Kings xxii. 49 (see 2 Chron. xx. 35), and\r\n    the narrative in 2 Kings i. (see ELIJAH), nothing is known of this\r\n    Ahaziah. Notwithstanding his very brief reign (1 Kings xxii. 51; 2\r\n    Kings iii. 1), the compiler passes the usual hostile judgment (1\r\n    Kings xxii. 52 seq.); see KINGS (BOOKS). The chronology in 1 Kings\r\n    xxii. 51 is difficult; if Lucian's text (twenty-fourth year of\r\n    Jehoshaphat) is correct, Jehoram 1 and 2 must have come to their\r\n    respective thrones at almost the same time.\r\n\r\n  [2] In vii. 6 the hostility of Hittites and Mizraim (q.v.) points to\r\n    a period _after_ 842 B.C. (See JEWS, § 10 seq.)\r\n\r\n  [3] These details are scarcely the invention of the chronicler; see\r\n    CHRONICLES, and EXPOSITOR, Aug. 1906, p. 191.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEHOSHAPHAT (Heb. \"Yahweh judges\"), in the Bible, son of Asa, and king\r\nof Judah, in the 9th century B.C. During his period close relations\r\nsubsisted between Israel and Judah; the two royal houses were connected\r\nby marriage (see ATHALIAH; JEHORAM, 2), and undertook joint enterprise\r\nin war and commerce. Jehoshaphat aided Ahab in the battle against\r\nBenhadad at Ramoth-Gilead in which Ahab was slain (1 Kings xxii.; 2\r\nChron. xviii.; cf. the parallel incident in 2 Kings viii. 25-29), and\r\ntrading journeys to Ophir were undertaken by his fleet in conjunction no\r\ndoubt with Ahab as well as with his son Ahaziah (2 Chron. xx. 35 sqq.; 1\r\nKings xxii. 47 sqq.). The chronicler's account of his war against Moab,\r\nAmmon and Edomite tribes (2 Chron. xx.), must rest ultimately upon a\r\ntradition which is presupposed in the earlier source (1 Kings xxii. 47),\r\nand the disaster to the ships at Ezion-Geber at the head of the Gulf of\r\nAkaba preceded, if it was not the introduction to, the great revolt in\r\nthe days of Jehoshaphat's son Jehoram, where, again, the details in 2\r\nChron. xxi. must rely in the first instance upon an old source. Apart\r\nfrom what is said of Jehoshaphat's legislative measures (2 Chron. xix. 4\r\nsqq.; cf. the meaning of his name above), an account is preserved of his\r\nalliance with Jehoram of Israel against Moab (2 Kings iii.), on which\r\nsee JEHORAM; MOAB. The \"valley of Jehoshaphat\" (Joel iii. 12) has been\r\nidentified by tradition (as old as Eusebius) with the valley between\r\nJerusalem and the mount of Olives.     (S. A. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEHOVAH (YAHWEH[1]), in the Bible, the God of Israel. \"Jehovah\" is a\r\nmodern mispronunciation of the Hebrew name, resulting from combining the\r\nconsonants of that name, _Jhvh_, with the vowels of the word _adonay_,\r\n\"Lord,\" which the Jews substituted for the proper name in reading the\r\nscriptures. In such cases of substitution the vowels of the word which\r\nis to be read are written in the Hebrew text with the consonants of the\r\nword which is not to be read. The consonants of the word to be\r\nsubstituted are ordinarily written in the margin; but inasmuch as Adonay\r\nwas regularly read instead of the ineffable name Jhvh, it was deemed\r\nunnecessary to note the fact at every occurrence. When Christian\r\nscholars began to study the Old Testament in Hebrew, if they were\r\nignorant of this general rule or regarded the substitution as a piece of\r\nJewish superstition, reading what actually stood in the text, they would\r\ninevitably pronounce the name Jehovah. It is an unprofitable inquiry who\r\nfirst made this blunder; probably many fell into it independently. The\r\nstatement still commonly repeated that it originated with Petrus\r\nGalatinus (1518) is erroneous; Jehova occurs in manuscripts at least as\r\nearly as the 14th century.\r\n\r\nThe form Jehovah was used in the 16th century by many authors, both\r\nCatholic and Protestant, and in the 17th was zealously defended by\r\nFuller, Gataker, Leusden and others, against the criticisms of such\r\nscholars as Drusius, Cappellus and the elder Buxtorf. It appeared in the\r\nEnglish Bible in Tyndale's translation of the Pentateuch (1530), and is\r\nfound in all English Protestant versions of the 16th century except that\r\nof Coverdale (1535). In the Authorized Version of 1611 it occurs in\r\nExod. vi. 3; Ps. lxxxiii. 18; Isa. xii. 2; xxvi. 4, beside the compound\r\nnames Jehovah-jireh, Jehovah-nissi, Jehovah-shalom; elsewhere, in\r\naccordance with the usage of the ancient versions, Jhvh is represented\r\nby Lord (distinguished by capitals from the title \"Lord,\" Heb.\r\n_adonay_). In the Revised Version of 1885 Jehovah is retained in the\r\nplaces in which it stood in the A. V., and is introduced also in Exod.\r\nvi. 2, 6, 7, 8; Ps. lxviii. 20; Isa. xlix. 14; Jer. xvi. 21; Hab. iii.\r\n19. The American committee which cooperated in the revision desired to\r\nemploy the name Jehovah wherever Jhvh occurs in the original, and\r\neditions embodying their preferences are printed accordingly.\r\n\r\nSeveral centuries before the Christian era the name Jhvh had ceased to\r\nbe commonly used by the Jews. Some of the later writers in the Old\r\nTestament employ the appellative Elohim, God, prevailingly or\r\nexclusively; a collection of Psalms (Ps. xlii.-lxxxiii.) was revised by\r\nan editor who changed the Jhvh of the authors into Elohim (see e.g. xlv.\r\n7; xlviii. 10; l. 7; li. 14); observe also the frequency of \"the Most\r\nHigh,\" \"the God of Heaven,\" \"King of Heaven,\" in Daniel, and of \"Heaven\"\r\nin First Maccabees. The oldest Greek versions (Septuagint), from the\r\nthird century B.C., consistently use [Greek: Kyrios], \"Lord,\" where the\r\nHebrew has Jhvh, corresponding to the substitution of Adonay for Jhvh in\r\nreading the original; in books written in Greek in this period (e.g.\r\nWisdom, 2 and 3 Maccabees), as in the New Testament, [Greek: Kyrios]\r\ntakes the place of the name of God. Josephus, who as a priest knew the\r\npronunciation of the name, declares that religion forbids him to divulge\r\nit; Philo calls it ineffable, and says that it is lawful for those only\r\nwhose ears and tongues are purified by wisdom to hear and utter it in a\r\nholy place (that is, for priests in the Temple); and in another passage,\r\ncommenting on Lev. xxiv. 15 seq.: \"If anyone, I do not say should\r\nblaspheme against the Lord of men and gods, but should even dare to\r\nutter his name unseasonably, let him expect the penalty of death.\"[2]\r\n\r\nVarious motives may have concurred to bring about the suppression of the\r\nname. An instinctive feeling that a proper name for God implicitly\r\nrecognizes the existence of other gods may have had some influence;\r\nreverence and the fear lest the holy name should be profaned among the\r\nheathen were potent reasons; but probably the most cogent motive was the\r\ndesire to prevent the abuse of the name in magic. If so, the secrecy had\r\nthe opposite effect; the name of the god of the Jews was one of the\r\ngreat names in magic, heathen as well as Jewish, and miraculous efficacy\r\nwas attributed to the mere utterance of it.\r\n\r\nIn the liturgy of the Temple the name was pronounced in the priestly\r\nbenediction (Num. vi. 27) after the regular daily sacrifice (in the\r\nsynagogues a substitute--probably Adonay--was employed);[3] on the Day\r\nof Atonement the High Priest uttered the name ten times in his prayers\r\nand benediction. In the last generations before the fall of Jerusalem,\r\nhowever, it was pronounced in a low tone so that the sounds were lost in\r\nthe chant of the priests.[4]\r\n\r\nAfter the destruction of the Temple (A.D. 70) the liturgical use of the\r\nname ceased, but the tradition was perpetuated in the schools of the\r\nrabbis.[5] It was certainly known in Babylonia in the latter part of the\r\n4th century,[6] and not improbably much later. Nor was the knowledge\r\nconfined to these pious circles; the name continued to be employed by\r\nhealers, exorcists and magicians, and has been preserved in many places\r\nin magical papyri. The vehemence with which the utterance of the name is\r\ndenounced in the Mishna--\"He who pronounces the Name with its own\r\nletters has no part in the world to come!\"[7]--suggests that this misuse\r\nof the name was not uncommon among Jews.\r\n\r\nThe Samaritans, who otherwise shared the scruples of the Jews about the\r\nutterance of the name, seem to have used it in judicial oaths to the\r\nscandal of the rabbis.[8]\r\n\r\nThe early Christian scholars, who inquired what was the true name of the\r\nGod of the Old Testament, had therefore no great difficulty in getting\r\nthe information they sought. Clement of Alexandria (d. c. 212) says that\r\nit was pronounced [Greek: Iaoue].[9] Epiphanius (d. 404), who was born\r\nin Palestine and spent a considerable part of his life there, gives\r\n[Greek: Iabe] (one cod. [Greek: Iaue]).[10] Theodoret (d. c. 457),[11]\r\nborn in Antioch, writes that the Samaritans pronounced the name [Greek:\r\nIabe] (in another passage, [Greek: Iabai]), the Jews [Greek: Aia].[12]\r\nThe latter is probably not Jhvh but _Ehyeh_ (Exod. iii. 14), which the\r\nJews counted among the names of God; there is no reason whatever to\r\nimagine that the Samaritans pronounced the name Jhvh differently from\r\nthe Jews. This direct testimony is supplemented by that of the magical\r\ntexts, in which [Greek: Iabe zebyth] (Jahveh Sebaoth), as well as\r\n[Greek: Iaba], occurs frequently.[13] In an Ethiopic list of magical\r\nnames of Jesus, purporting to have been taught by him to his disciples,\r\n_Yawe_ is found.[14] Finally, there is evidence from more than one\r\nsource that the modern Samaritan priests pronounce the name _Yahweh_ or\r\n_Yahwa_.[15]\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to impugn the soundness of this substantially\r\nconsentient testimony to the pronunciation Yahweh or Jahveh, coming as\r\nit does through several independent channels. It is confirmed by\r\ngrammatical considerations. The name Jhvh enters into the composition of\r\nmany proper names of persons in the Old Testament, either as the initial\r\nelement, in the form Jeho- or Jo- (as in Jehoram, Joram), or as the\r\nfinal element, in the form _-jahu_ or _-jah_ (as in Adonijahu,\r\nAdonijah). These various forms are perfectly regular if the divine name\r\nwas Yahweh, and, taken altogether, they cannot be explained on any other\r\nhypothesis. Recent scholars, accordingly, with but few exceptions, are\r\nagreed that the ancient pronunciation of the name was Yahweh (the first\r\nh sounded at the end of the syllable).\r\n\r\nGenebrardus seems to have been the first to suggest the pronunciation\r\n_Iahué_,[16] but it was not until the 19th century that it became\r\ngenerally accepted.\r\n\r\nJahveh or Yahweh is apparently an example of a common type of Hebrew\r\nproper names which have the form of the 3rd pers. sing, of the verb.\r\ne.g. Jabneh (name of a city), Jabin, Jamlek, Jiptah (Jephthah), &c. Most\r\nof these really are verbs, the suppressed or implicit subject being\r\n_'el_, \"_numen_, god,\" or the name of a god; cf. Jabneh and Jabne-el,\r\nJiptah and Jiptah-el.\r\n\r\nThe ancient explanations of the name proceed from Exod. iii. 14, 15,\r\nwhere \"Yahweh[17] hath sent me\" in v. 15 corresponds to \"Ehyeh hath sent\r\nme\" in v. 14, thus seeming to connect the name Yahweh with the Hebrew\r\nverb _hayah_, \"to become, to be.\" The Palestinian interpreters found in\r\nthis the promise that God would be with his people (cf. v. 12) in\r\nfuture oppressions as he was in the present distress, or the assertion\r\nof his eternity, or eternal constancy; the Alexandrian translation\r\n[Greek: 'Egô eimi ho ôn ... 'Ho ôn apestalken me pros hymas],\r\nunderstands it in the more metaphysical sense of God's absolute being.\r\nBoth interpretations, \"He (who) is (always the same),\" and \"He (who) is\r\n(absolutely, the truly existent),\" import into the name all that they\r\nprofess to find in it; the one, the religious faith in God's unchanging\r\nfidelity to his people, the other, a philosophical conception of\r\nabsolute being which is foreign both to the meaning of the Hebrew verb\r\nand to the force of the tense employed. Modern scholars have sometimes\r\nfound in the name the expression of the aseity[18] of God; sometimes of\r\nhis reality, in contrast to the imaginary gods of the heathen. Another\r\nexplanation, which appears first in Jewish authors of the middle ages\r\nand has found wide acceptance in recent times, derives the name from the\r\ncausative of the verb; He (who) causes things to be, gives them being;\r\nor calls events into existence, brings them to pass; with many\r\nindividual modifications of interpretation--creator, life-giver,\r\nfulfiller of promises. A serious objection to this theory in every form\r\nis that the verb _hayah_, \"to be,\" has no causative stem in Hebrew; to\r\nexpress the ideas which these scholars find in the name Yahweh the\r\nlanguage employs altogether different verbs.\r\n\r\nThis assumption that Yahweh is derived from the verb \"to be,\" as seems\r\nto be implied in Exod. iii. 14 seq., is not, however, free from\r\ndifficulty. \"To be\" in the Hebrew of the Old Testament is not _hawah_,\r\nas the derivation would require, but _hayah_; and we are thus driven to\r\nthe further assumption that _hawah_ belongs to an earlier stage of the\r\nlanguage, or to some older speech of the forefathers of the Israelites.\r\nThis hypothesis is not intrinsically improbable--and in Aramaic, a\r\nlanguage closely related to Hebrew, \"to be\" actually is _hawa_--but it\r\nshould be noted that in adopting it we admit that, using the name Hebrew\r\nin the historical sense, Yahweh is not a Hebrew name. And, inasmuch as\r\nnowhere in the Old Testament, outside of Exod. iii., is there the\r\nslightest indication that the Israelites connected the name of their God\r\nwith the idea of \"being\" in any sense, it may fairly be questioned\r\nwhether, if the author of Exod. iii. 14 seq., intended to give an\r\netymological interpretation of the name Yahweh,[19] his etymology is any\r\nbetter than many other paronomastic explanations of proper names in the\r\nOld Testament, or than, say, the connexion of the name [Greek: Apollôn]\r\nwith [Greek: apolouôn], [Greek: apolyôn] in Plato's _Cratylus_, or the\r\npopular derivation from [Greek: apollymi].\r\n\r\nA root _hawah_ is represented in Hebrew by the nouns _howah_ (Ezek.,\r\nIsa. xlvii. 11) and _hawwah_ (Ps., Prov., Job) \"disaster, calamity,\r\nruin.\"[20] The primary meaning is probably \"sink down, fall,\" in which\r\nsense--common in Arabic--the verb appears in Job xxxvii. 6 (of snow\r\nfalling to earth). A Catholic commentator of the 16th century,\r\nHieronymus ab Oleastro, seems to have been the first to connect the name\r\n\"Jehova\" with _howah_ interpreting it _contritio, sive pernicies_\r\n(destruction of the Egyptians and Canaanites); Daumer, adopting the same\r\netymology, took it in a more general sense: Yahweh, as well as Shaddai,\r\nmeant \"Destroyer,\" and fitly expressed the nature of the terrible god\r\nwhom he identified with Moloch.\r\n\r\nThe derivation of Yahweh from _hawah_ is formally unimpeachable, and is\r\nadopted by many recent scholars, who proceed, however, from the primary\r\nsense of the root rather than from the specific meaning of the nouns.\r\nThe name is accordingly interpreted, He (who) falls (baetyl, [Greek:\r\nbaitylos], meteorite); or causes (rain or lightning) to fall (storm\r\ngod); or casts down (his foes, by his thunderbolts). It is obvious that\r\nif the derivation be correct, the significance of the name, which in\r\nitself denotes only \"He falls\" or \"He fells,\" must be learned, if at\r\nall, from early Israelitish conceptions of the nature of Yahweh rather\r\nthan from etymology.\r\n\r\nA more fundamental question is whether the name Yahweh originated among\r\nthe Israelites or was adopted by them from some other people and\r\nspeech.[21] The biblical author of the history of the sacred\r\ninstitutions (P) expressly declares that the name Yahweh was unknown to\r\nthe patriarchs (Exod. vi. 3), and the much older Israelite historian (E)\r\nrecords the first revelation of the name to Moses (Exod. iii. 13-15),\r\napparently following a tradition according to which the Israelites had\r\nnot been worshippers of Yahweh before the time of Moses, or, as he\r\nconceived it, had not worshipped the god of their fathers under that\r\nname. The revelation of the name to Moses was made at a mountain sacred\r\nto Yahweh (the mountain of God) far to the south of Palestine, in a\r\nregion where the forefathers of the Israelites had never roamed, and in\r\nthe territory of other tribes; and long after the settlement in Canaan\r\nthis region continued to be regarded as the abode of Yahweh (Judg. v. 4;\r\nDeut. xxxiii. 2 sqq.; 1 Kings xix. 8 sqq. &c.). Moses is closely\r\nconnected with the tribes in the vicinity of the holy mountain;\r\naccording to one account, he married a daughter of the priest of Midian\r\n(Exod. ii. 16 sqq.; iii. 1); to this mountain he led the Israelites\r\nafter their deliverance from Egypt; there his father-in-law met him, and\r\nextolling Yahweh as \"greater than all the gods,\" offered (in his\r\ncapacity as priest of the place?) sacrifices, at which the chief men of\r\nthe Israelites were his guests; there the religion of Yahweh was\r\nrevealed through Moses, and the Israelites pledged themselves to serve\r\nGod according to its prescriptions. It appears, therefore, that in the\r\ntradition followed by the Israelite historian the tribes within whose\r\npasture lands the mountain of God stood were worshippers of Yahweh\r\nbefore the time of Moses; and the surmise that the name Yahweh belongs\r\nto their speech, rather than to that of Israel, has considerable\r\nprobability. One of these tribes was Midian, in whose land the mountain\r\nof God lay. The Kenites also, with whom another tradition connects\r\nMoses, seem to have been worshippers of Yahweh. It is probable that\r\nYahweh was at one time worshipped by various tribes south of Palestine,\r\nand that several places in that wide territory (Horeb, Sinai, Kadesh,\r\n&c.) were sacred to him; the oldest and most famous of these, the\r\nmountain of God, seems to have lain in Arabia, east of the Red Sea. From\r\nsome of these peoples and at one of these holy places, a group of\r\nIsraelite tribes adopted the religion of Yahweh, the God who, by the\r\nhand of Moses, had delivered them from Egypt.[22]\r\n\r\nThe tribes of this region probably belonged to some branch of the great\r\nArab stock, and the name Yahweh has, accordingly, been connected with\r\nthe Arabic _hawa_, \"the void\" (between heaven and earth), \"the\r\natmosphere,\" or with the verb _hawa_, cognate with Heb. _hawah_, \"sink,\r\nglide down\" (through space); _hawwa_ \"blow\" (wind). \"He rides through\r\nthe air, He blows\" (Wellhausen), would be a fit name for a god of wind\r\nand storm. There is, however, no certain evidence that the Israelites in\r\nhistorical times had any consciousness of the primitive significance of\r\nthe name.\r\n\r\nThe attempts to connect the name Yahweh with that of an Indo-European\r\ndeity (Jehovah-Jove, &c.), or to derive it from Egyptian or Chinese, may\r\nbe passed over. But one theory which has had considerable currency\r\nrequires notice, namely, that Yahweh, or Yahu, Yaho,[23] is the name of\r\na god worshipped throughout the whole, or a great part, of the area\r\noccupied by the Western Semites. In its earlier form this opinion rested\r\nchiefly on certain misinterpreted testimonies in Greek authors about a\r\ngod [Greek: Iaô], and was conclusively refuted by Baudissin; recent\r\nadherents of the theory build more largely on the occurrence in various\r\nparts of this territory of proper names of persons and places which\r\nthey explain as compounds of Yahu or Yah.[24] The explanation is in most\r\ncases simply an assumption of the point at issue; some of the names have\r\nbeen misread; others are undoubtedly the names of Jews. There remain,\r\nhowever, some cases in which it is highly probable that names of\r\nnon-Israelites are really compounded with Yahweh. The most conspicuous\r\nof these is the king of Hamath who in the inscriptions of Sargon\r\n(722-705 B.C.) is called Yaubi'di and Ilubi'di (compare\r\nJehoiakim-Eliakim). Azriyau of Jaudi, also, in inscriptions of\r\nTiglath-Pileser (745-728 B.C.), who was formerly supposed to be Azariah\r\n(Uzziah) of Judah, is probably a king of the country in northern Syria\r\nknown to us from the Zenjirli inscriptions as Ja'di.\r\n\r\nFriedrich Delitzsch brought into notice three tablets, of the age of the\r\nfirst dynasty of Babylon, in which he read the names of _Ya-a'-ve-ilu_,\r\n_Ya-ve-ilu_, and _Ya-u-um-ilu_ (\"Yahweh is God\"), and which he regarded\r\nas conclusive proof that Yahweh was known in Babylonia before 2000 B.C.;\r\nhe was a god of the Semitic invaders in the second wave of migration,\r\nwho were, according to Winckler and Delitzsch, of North Semitic stock\r\n(Canaanites, in the linguistic sense).[25] We should thus have in the\r\ntablets evidence of the worship of Yahweh among the Western Semites at a\r\ntime long before the rise of Israel. The reading of the names is,\r\nhowever, extremely uncertain, not to say improbable, and the\r\nfar-reaching inferences drawn from them carry no conviction. In a tablet\r\nattributed to the 14th century B.C. which Sellin found in the course of\r\nhis excavations at Tell Ta'annuk (the Taanach of the O.T.) a name occurs\r\nwhich may be read Ahi-Yawi (equivalent to Hebrew Ahijah);[26] if the\r\nreading be correct, this would show that Yahweh was worshipped in\r\nCentral Palestine before the Israelite conquest. The reading is,\r\nhowever, only one of several possibilities. The fact that the full form\r\nYahweh appears, whereas in Hebrew proper names only the shorter Yahu and\r\nYah occur, weighs somewhat against the interpretation, as it does\r\nagainst Delitzsch's reading of his tablets.\r\n\r\nIt would not be at all surprising if, in the great movements of\r\npopulations and shifting of ascendancy which lie beyond our historical\r\nhorizon, the worship of Yahweh should have been established in regions\r\nremote from those which it occupied in historical times; but nothing\r\nwhich we now know warrants the opinion that his worship was ever general\r\namong the Western Semites.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to trace the West Semitic Yahu back to\r\nBabylonia. Thus Delitzsch formerly derived the name from an Akkadian\r\ngod, I or Ia; or from the Semitic nominative ending, Yau;[27] but this\r\ndeity has since disappeared from the pantheon of Assyriologists. The\r\ncombination of Yah with Ea, one of the great Babylonian gods, seems to\r\nhave a peculiar fascination for amateurs, by whom it is periodically\r\n\"discovered.\" Scholars are now agreed that, so far as Yahu or Yah occurs\r\nin Babylonian texts, it is as the name of a foreign god.\r\n\r\nAssuming that Yahweh was primitively a nature god, scholars in the 19th\r\ncentury discussed the question over what sphere of nature he originally\r\npresided. According to some he was the god of consuming fire; others saw\r\nin him the bright sky, or the heaven; still others recognized in him a\r\nstorm god, a theory with which the derivation of the name from Heb.\r\n_hawah_ or Arab. _hawa_ well accords. The association of Yahweh with\r\nstorm and fire is frequent in the Old Testament; the thunder is the\r\nvoice of Yahweh, the lightning his arrows, the rainbow his bow. The\r\nrevelation at Sinai is amid the awe-inspiring phenomena of tempest.\r\nYahweh leads Israel through the desert in a pillar of cloud and fire; he\r\nkindles Elijah's altar by lightning, and translates the prophet in a\r\nchariot of fire. See also Judg. v. 4 seq.; Deut. xxxiii. 1; Ps. xviii.\r\n7-15; Hab. iii. 3-6. The cherub upon which he rides when he flies on the\r\nwings of the wind (Ps. xviii. 10) is not improbably an ancient\r\nmythological personification of the storm cloud, the genius of tempest\r\n(cf. Ps. civ. 3). In Ezekiel the throne of Yahweh is borne up on\r\nCherubim, the noise of whose wings is like thunder. Though we may\r\nrecognize in this poetical imagery the survival of ancient and, if we\r\nplease, mythical notions, we should err if we inferred that Yahweh was\r\noriginally a departmental god, presiding specifically over\r\nmeteorological phenomena, and that this conception of him persisted\r\namong the Israelites till very late times. Rather, as the god--or the\r\nchief god--of a region and a people, the most sublime and impressive\r\nphenomena, the control of the mightiest forces of nature are attributed\r\nto him. As the God of Israel Yahweh becomes its leader and champion in\r\nwar; he is a warrior, mighty in battle; but he is not a god of war in\r\nthe specific sense.\r\n\r\nIn the inquiry concerning the nature of Yahweh the name Yahweh Sebaoth\r\n(E.V., The LORD of Hosts) has had an important place. The hosts have by\r\nsome been interpreted of the armies of Israel (see 1 Sam. xvii. 45, and\r\nnote the association of the name in the Books of Samuel, where it first\r\nappears, with the ark, or with war); by others, of the heavenly hosts,\r\nthe stars conceived as living beings, later, perhaps, the angels as the\r\ncourt of Yahweh and the instruments of his will in nature and history\r\n(Ps. lxxxix.); or of the forces of the world in general which do his\r\nbidding, cf. the common Greek renderings, [Greek: Kyrios tôn dynameôn]\r\nand [Greek: K. pantokratôr], (Universal Ruler). It is likely that the\r\nname was differently understood in different periods and circles; but in\r\nthe prophets the hosts are clearly superhuman powers. In many passages\r\nthe name seems to be only a more solemn substitute for the simple\r\nYahweh, and as such it has probably often been inserted by scribes.\r\nFinally, Sebaoth came to be treated as a proper name (cf. Ps. lxxx. 5,\r\n8, 20), and as such is very common in magical texts.\r\n\r\n  LITERATURE.--Reland, _Decas exercitationum philologicarum de vera\r\n  pronuntiatione nominis Jehova_, 1707; Reinke,\r\n  \"Philologisch-historische Abhandlung über den Gottesnamen Jehova,\" in\r\n  _Beiträge zur Erklärung des Alten Testaments_, III.

Ahaziah son of Jehoram\r\nof Judah and Jehoram brother of Ahaziah of Israel had taken joint action\r\nagainst the Aramaeans of Damascus who were attacking Ramoth-Gilead under\r\nHazael. Jehoram had returned wounded to his palace at Jezreel, whither\r\nAhaziah had come down to visit him. Jehu, meanwhile, remained at the\r\nseat of war, and the prophet Elisha sent a messenger to anoint him king.\r\nThe general at once acknowledged the call, \"drove furiously\" to Jezreel,\r\nand, having slain both kings, proceeded to exterminate the whole of the\r\nroyal family (2 Kings ix., x.). A similar fate befell the royal princes\r\nof Judah (see ATHALIAH), and thus, for a time at least, the new king\r\nmust have had complete control over the two kingdoms (cf. 2 Chron. xxii.\r\n9). Israelite historians viewed these events as a great religious\r\nrevolution inspired by Elijah and initiated by Elisha, as the overthrow\r\nof the worship of Baal, and as a retribution for the cruel murder of\r\nNaboth the Jezreelite (see JEZEBEL). A vivid description is given of the\r\ndestruction of the prophets of Baal at the temple in Samaria (2 Kings x.\r\n27; contrast iii. 2). While Jehu was supported by the Rechabites in his\r\nreforming zeal, a similar revolt against Baalism in Judah is ascribed to\r\nthe priest Jehoiada (see JOASH). In the tragedies of the period it seems\r\nclear that Elisha's interest in both Jehu and the Syrian Hazael (2 Kings\r\nviii. 7 sqq.) had some political significance, and in opposition to the\r\n\"Deuteronomic\" the commendation in 2 Kings x. 28 sqq., Hosea's\r\ndenunciation (i. 4) indicates the judgment which was passed upon Jehu's\r\nbloodshed in other circles.\r\n\r\nIn the course of an expedition against Hazael in 842 Shalmaneser II. of\r\nAssyria received tribute of silver and gold from Ya-u-a son of Omri,[1]\r\nTyre and Sidon; another attack followed in 839. For some years after\r\nthis Assyria was unable to interfere, and war broke out between Damascus\r\nand Israel. The Israelite story, which may perhaps be supplemented from\r\nJudaean sources (see JOASH), records a great loss of territory on the\r\neast of the Jordan (2 Kings x. 32 seq.). Under Jehu's successor Jehoahaz\r\nthere was continual war with Hazael and his son Benhadad, but relief was\r\nobtained by his grandson Joash, and the land recovered complete\r\nindependence under Jeroboam.\r\n\r\n  Jehu is also the name of a prophet of the time of Baasha and\r\n  Jehoshaphat (1 Kings xvi.; 2 Chron. xix., xx.).

Antiq._, 1900, p. 24 seq., pl. ii.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEKYLL, SIR JOSEPH (1663-1738), English lawyer and master of the rolls,\r\nson of John Jekyll, was born in London, and after studying at the Middle\r\nTemple was called to the bar in 1687. He rapidly rose to be chief\r\njustice of Chester (1697), serjeant-at-law and king's serjeant (1700),\r\nand a knight. In 1717 he was made master of the rolls. A Whig in\r\npolitics, he sat in parliament for various constituencies from 1697 to\r\nthe end of his life, and took an active part there in debating\r\nconstitutional questions with much learning, though, according to Lord\r\nHervey (_Mem._ 1, 474), with little \"approbation.\" He was censured by\r\nthe House of Commons for accepting a brief for the defence of Lord\r\nHalifax in a prosecution ordered by the house. He was one of the\r\nmanagers of the impeachment of the Jacobite earl of Wintoun in 1715, and\r\nof Harley (Lord Oxford) in 1717. In later years he supported Walpole. He\r\nbecame very unpopular in 1736 for his introduction of the \"gin act,\"\r\ntaxing the retailing of spirituous liquors, and his house had to be\r\nprotected from the mob. Pope has an illusion to \"Jekyll or some odd\r\nWhig, Who never changed his principle or wig\" (_Epilogue to the\r\nSatires_). Jekyll was also responsible for the Mortmain Act of 1736,\r\nwhich was not superseded till 1888. He died without issue in 1738.\r\n\r\nHis great-nephew JOSEPH JEKYLL (d. 1837) was a lawyer, politician and\r\nwit, who excited a good deal of contemporary satire, and who wrote some\r\n_jeux d'esprit_ which were well-known in his time. His _Letters of the\r\nlate Ignatius Sancho, an African_, was published in 1782. In 1894 his\r\ncorrespondence was edited, with a memoir, by the Hon. Algernon Bourke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJELLACHICH, JOSEF, COUNT (1801-1859), Croatian statesman, was born on\r\nthe 16th of October 1801 at Pétervárad. He entered the Austrian army\r\n(1819), fought against the Bosnians in 1845, was made ban of Croatia,\r\nSlavonia and Dalmatia in 1848 on the petition of the Croatians, and was\r\nsimultaneously raised to the rank of lieutenant-general by the emperor.\r\nAs ban, Jellachich's policy was directed to preserving the Slav kingdoms\r\nfor the Habsburg monarchy by identifying himself with the nationalist\r\nopposition to Magyar ascendancy, while at the same time discouraging the\r\nextreme \"Illyrism\" advocated by Lodovik Gáj (1809-1872). Though his\r\nseparatist measures at first brought him into disfavour at the imperial\r\ncourt, their true objective was soon recognized, and, with the triumph\r\nof the more violent elements of the Hungarian revolution, he was hailed\r\nas the most conspicuous champion of the unity of the empire, and was\r\nable to bring about that union of the imperial army with the southern\r\nSlavs by which the revolution in Vienna and Budapest was overthrown (see\r\nAUSTRIA-HUNGARY: _History_). He began the war of independence in\r\nSeptember 1848 by crossing the Drave at the head of 40,000 Croats. After\r\nthe bloody battle of Buda he concluded a three days' truce with the\r\nHungarians to enable him to assist Prince Windischgrätz to reduce\r\nVienna, and subsequently fought against the Magyars at Schwechát. During\r\nthe winter campaign of 1848-49 he commanded, under Windischgrätz, the\r\nAustrian right wing, capturing Magyar-Ovar and Raab, and defeating the\r\nMagyars at Mór. After the recapture of Buda he was made\r\ncommander-in-chief of the southern army. At first he gained some\r\nsuccesses against Bem (q.v.), but on the 14th of July 1849 was routed by\r\nthe Hungarians at Hegyes and driven behind the Danube. He took no part\r\nin the remainder of the war, but returned to Agram to administer\r\nCroatia. In 1853 he was appointed commander-in-chief of the army sent\r\nagainst Montenegro, and in 1855 was created a count. He died on the 20th\r\nof May 1859. His _Gedichte_ were published at Vienna in 1851.\r\n\r\n  See the anonymous _The Croatian Revolution_ of the Year 1848 (Croat.),\r\n  Agram, 1898.     (R. N. B.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJELLINEK, ADOLF (1821-1893), Jewish preacher and scholar, was born in\r\nMoravia. After filling clerical posts in Leipzig, he became _Prediger_\r\n(preacher) in Vienna in 1856. He was associated with the promoters of\r\nthe New Learning within Judaism, and wrote on the history of the\r\nKabbala. His bibliographies (each bearing the Hebrew title _Qontres_)\r\nwere useful compilations. But his most important work lay in three other\r\ndirections. (1) _Midrashic._ Jellinek published in the six parts of his\r\n_Beth ha-Midrasch_ (1853-1878) a large number of smaller _Midrashi_,\r\nancient and medieval homilies and folk-lore records, which have been of\r\nmuch service in the recent revival of interest in Jewish apocalyptic\r\nliterature. A translation of these collections of Jellinek into German\r\nwas undertaken by A. Wuensche, under the general title _Aus Israels\r\nLehrhalle_. (2) _Psychological._ Before the study of ethnic psychology\r\nhad become a science, Jellinek devoted attention to the subject. There\r\nis much keen analysis and original investigation in his two essays _Der\r\njüdische Stamm_ (1869) and _Der jüdische Stamm in nicht-jüdischen\r\nSprüch-wörtern_ (1881-1882). It is to Jellinek that we owe the\r\noft-repeated comparison of the Jewish temperament to that of women in\r\nits quickness of perception, versatility and sensibility. (3)\r\n_Homiletic._ Jellinek was probably the greatest synagogue orator of the\r\n19th century. He published some 200 sermons, in most of which are\r\ndisplayed unobtrusive learning, fresh application of old sayings, and a\r\nhigh conception of Judaism and its claims. Jellinek was a powerful\r\napologist and an accomplished homilist, at once profound and ingenious.\r\n\r\nHis son, GEORGE JELLINEK, was appointed professor of international law\r\nat Heidelberg in 1891. Another son, MAX HERMANN JELLINEK, was made\r\nassistant professor of philology at Vienna in 1892.\r\n\r\nA brother of Adolf, HERMANN JELLINEK (b. 1823), was executed at the age\r\nof 26 on account of his association with the Hungarian national movement\r\nof 1848. One of Hermann Jellinek's best-known works was _Uriel Acosta_.\r\nAnother brother, MORITZ JELLINEK (1823-1883), was an accomplished\r\neconomist, and contributed to the Academy of Sciences essays on the\r\nprice of cereals and on the statistical organization of the country. He\r\nfounded the Budapest tramway company (1864) and was also president of\r\nthe corn exchange.\r\n\r\n  See _Jewish Encyclopedia_, vii. 92-94. For a character sketch of Adolf\r\n  Jellinek see S. Singer, _Lectures and Addresses_ (1908), pp. 88-93;\r\n  Kohut, _Berühmte israelitische Männer und Frauen_.     (I. A.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEMAPPES, a town in the province of Hainaut, Belgium, near Mons, famous\r\nas the scene of the battle at which Dumouriez, at the head of the French\r\nRevolutionary Army, defeated the Austrian army (which was greatly\r\noutnumbered) under the duke of Saxe-Teschen and Clerfayt on the 6th of\r\nNovember 1792 (see FRENCH REVOLUTIONARY WARS).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJENA, a university town of Germany, in the grand duchy of Saxe-Weimar,\r\non the left bank of the Saale, 56 m. S.W. from Leipzig by the\r\nGrossberigen-Saalfeld and 12 m. S.E. of Weimar by the Weimar-Gera lines\r\nof railway. Pop. (1905), 26,355. Its situation in a broad valley\r\nenvironed by limestone hills is somewhat dreary. To the north lies the\r\nplateau, descending steeply to the valley, famous as the scene of the\r\nbattle of Jena. The town is surrounded by promenades occupying the site\r\nof the old fortifications; it contains in addition to the medieval\r\nmarket square, many old-fashioned houses and quaint narrow streets.\r\nBesides the old university buildings, the most interesting edifices are\r\nthe 15th-century church of St Michael, with a tower 318 ft. high,\r\ncontaining an altar, beneath which is a doorway leading to a vault, and\r\na bronze statue of Luther, originally destined for his tomb; the\r\nuniversity library, in which is preserved a curious figure of a dragon;\r\nand the bridge across the Saale, as long as the church steeple is high,\r\nthe centre arch of which is surmounted by a stone carved head of a\r\nmalefactor. Across the river is the \"mountain,\" or hill, whence a fine\r\nview is obtained of the town and surroundings, and hard by the\r\nFuchs-Turm (Fox tower) celebrated for student orgies, while in the\r\ncentre of the town is the house of an astronomer, Weigel, with a deep\r\nshaft through which the stars can be seen in the day time. Thus the\r\nseven marvels of Jena are summed up in the Latin lines:--\r\n\r\n  _Ara, caput, draco, mons, pons, vulpecula turris,\r\n  Weigeliana domus; septem miracula Jenae._\r\n\r\nThere must also be mentioned the university church, the new university\r\nbuildings, which occupy the site of the ducal palace (Schloss) where\r\nGoethe wrote his _Hermann und Dorothea_, the Schwarzer Bär Hotel, where\r\nLuther spent the night after his flight from the Wartburg, and four\r\ntowers and a gateway which now alone mark the position of the ancient\r\nwalls. The town has of late years become a favourite residential resort\r\nand has greatly extended towards the west, where there is a colony of\r\npleasant villas. Its chief prosperity centres, however, in the\r\nuniversity. In 1547 the elector John Frederick the Magnanimous of\r\nSaxony, while a captive in the hands of the emperor Charles V.,\r\nconceived the plan of founding a university at Jena, which was\r\naccordingly established by his three sons. After having obtained a\r\ncharter from the emperor Ferdinand I., it was inaugurated on the 2nd of\r\nFebruary 1558. It was most numerously attended about the middle of the\r\n18th century; but the most brilliant professoriate was under the duke\r\nCharles Augustus, Goethe's patron (1787-1806), when Fichte, Hegel,\r\nSchelling, Schlegel and Schiller were on its teaching staff. Founded as\r\na home for the new religious opinions of the 16th century, it has ever\r\nbeen in the forefront of German universities in liberally accepting new\r\nideas. It distances perhaps every other German university in the extent\r\nto which it carries out what are popularly regarded as the\r\ncharacteristics of German student-life--duelling and the passion for\r\n_Freiheit_. At the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th\r\ncentury, the opening of new universities, co-operating with the\r\nsuspicions of the various German governments as to the democratic\r\nopinions which obtained at Jena, militated against the university, which\r\nhas never regained its former prosperity. In 1905 it was attended by\r\nabout 1100 students, and its teaching staff (including _privatdocenten_)\r\nnumbered 112. Amongst its numerous auxiliaries may be mentioned the\r\nlibrary, with 200,000 volumes, the observatory, the meteorological\r\ninstitute, the botanical garden, seminaries of theology, philology and\r\neducation, and well equipped clinical, anatomical and physical\r\ninstitutes. There are also veterinary and agricultural colleges in\r\nconnexion with the university. The manufactures of Jena are not\r\nconsiderable. The book trade has of late years revived, and there are\r\nseveral printing establishments.\r\n\r\nJena appears to have possessed municipal rights in the 13th century. At\r\nthe beginning of the 14th century it was in the possession of the\r\nmargraves of Meissen, from whom it passed in 1423 to the elector of\r\nSaxony. Since 1485 it has remained in the Ernestine line of the house of\r\nSaxony. In 1662 it fell to Bernhard, youngest son of William duke of\r\nWeimar, and became the capital of a small separate duchy. Bernhard's\r\nline having become extinct in 1690, Jena was united with Eisenach, and\r\nin 1741 reverted with that duchy to Weimar. In more modern times Jena\r\nhas been made famous by the defeat inflicted in the vicinity, on the\r\n14th of October 1806, by Napoleon upon the Prussian army under the\r\nprince of Hohenlohe (see NAPOLEONIC CAMPAIGNS).\r\n\r\n  See Schreiber and Färber, _Jena von seinem Ursprung bis zur neuesten\r\n  Zeit_ (2nd ed., 1858); Ortloff, _Jena und Umgegend_ (3rd ed., 1875);\r\n  Leonhardt, _Jena als Universität und Stadt_ (Jena, 1902); Ritter,\r\n  _Führer durch Jena und Umgebung_ (Jena, 1901); Biedermann, _Die\r\n  Universität Jena_ (Jena, 1858); and the _Urkundenbuch der Stadt Jena_\r\n  edited by J.

He studied\r\nat Zürich and Basel, and in 1617 became the Protestant pastor of\r\nScharans (near Thusis). But almost at once he plunged into active\r\npolitics, taking the side of the Venetian and Protestant party of the\r\nSalis family, as against the Spanish and Romanist policy supported by\r\nthe rival family, that of Planta. He headed the \"preachers\" who in 1618\r\ntortured to death the arch-priest Rusca, of Sondrio, and outlawed the\r\nPlantas. As reprisals, a number of Protestants were massacred at Tirano\r\n(1620), in the Valtellina, a very fertile valley, of considerable\r\nstrategical importance (for through it the Spaniards in Milan could\r\ncommunicate by the Umbrail Pass with the Austrians in Tirol), which then\r\nfell into the hands of the Spanish. Jenatsch took part in the murder\r\n(1621) of Pompey Planta, the head of the rival party, but later with his\r\nfriends was compelled to fly the country, giving up his position as a\r\npastor, and henceforth acting solely as a soldier. He helped in the\r\nrevolt against the Austrians in the Prättigau (1622), and in the\r\ninvasion of the Valtellina by a French army (1624), but the peace made\r\n(1626) between France and Spain left the Valtellina in the hands of the\r\npope, and so destroyed Jenatsch's hopes. Having killed his colonel,\r\nRuinelli, in a duel, Jenatsch had once more to leave his native land,\r\nand took service with the Venetians (1629-1630). In 1631 he went to\r\nParis, and actively supported Richelieu's schemes for driving the\r\nSpaniards out of the Valtellina, which led to the successful campaign of\r\nRohan (1635), one of whose firmest supporters was Jenatsch. But he soon\r\nsaw that the French were as unwilling as the Spaniards to restore the\r\nValtellina to the Grisons (which had seized it in 1512). So he became a\r\nRomanist (1635), and negotiated secretly with the Spaniards and\r\nAustrians. He was the leader of the conspiracy which broke out in 1637,\r\nand resulted in the expulsion of Rohan and the French from the Grisons.\r\nThis treachery on Jenatsch's part did not, however, lead to the freeing\r\nof the Valtellina from the Spaniards, and once more he tried to get\r\nFrench support. But on the 24th of January 1639 he was assassinated at\r\nCoire by the Plantas; later in the same year the much coveted valley was\r\nrestored by Spain to the Grisons, which held it till 1797. Jenatsch's\r\ncareer is of general historical importance by reason of the long\r\nconflict between France and Spain for the possession of the Valtellina,\r\nwhich forms one of the most bloody episodes in the Thirty Years' War.\r\n     (W. A. B. C.)\r\n\r\n  See biography by E. Haffter (Davos, 1894).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJENGHIZ KHAN (1162-1227), Mongol emperor, was born in a tent on the\r\nbanks of the river Onon. His father Yesukai was absent at the time of\r\nhis birth, in a campaign against a Tatar chieftain named Temuchin. The\r\nfortune of war favoured Yesukai, who having slain his enemy returned to\r\nhis encampment in triumph. Here he was met by the news that his wife\r\nYulun had given birth to a son. On examining the child he observed in\r\nits clenched fist a clot of coagulated blood like a red stone. In the\r\neyes of the superstitious Mongol this circumstance referred to his\r\nvictory over the Tatar chieftain, and he therefore named the infant\r\nTemuchin. The death of Yesukai, which placed Temuchin at the age of\r\nthirteen on the Mongol throne, was the signal also for the dispersal of\r\nseveral tribes whose allegiance the old chieftain had retained by his\r\niron rule. When remonstrated with by Temuchin, the rebels replied: \"The\r\ndeepest wells are sometimes dry, and the hardest stone is sometimes\r\nbroken; why should we cling to thee?\" But Yulun was by no means willing\r\nto see her son's power melt away; she led those retainers who remained\r\nfaithful against the deserters, and succeeded in bringing back fully one\r\nhalf to their allegiance. With this doubtful material, Temuchin\r\nsucceeded in holding his ground against the plots and open hostilities\r\nof the neighbouring tribes, more especially of the Naimans, Keraits and\r\nMerkits. With one or other of these he maintained an almost unceasing\r\nwarfare until 1206, when he felt strong enough to proclaim himself the\r\nruler of an empire. He therefore summoned the notables of his kingdom\r\nto an assembly on the banks of the Onon, and at their unanimous request\r\nadopted the name and title of Jenghiz Khan (Chinese, Chêng-sze, or\r\n\"perfect warrior\"). At this time there remained to him but one open\r\nenemy on the Mongolian steppes, Polo the Naiman khan. Against this chief\r\nhe now led his troops, and in one battle so completely shattered his\r\nforces that Kushlek, the successor of Polo, who was left dead upon the\r\nfield, fled with his ally Toto, the Merkit khan, to the river Irtysh.\r\n\r\nJenghiz Khan now meditated an invasion of the empire of the Kin Tatars,\r\nwho had wrested northern China from the Sung dynasty. As a first step he\r\ninvaded western Hia, and, having captured several strongholds, retired\r\nin the summer of 1208 to Lung-ting to escape the great heat of the\r\nplains. While there news reached him that Toto and Kushlek were\r\npreparing for war. In a pitched battle on the river Irtysh he overthrew\r\nthem completely. Toto was amongst the slain, and Kushlek fled for refuge\r\nto the Khitan Tatars. Satisfied with his victory, Jenghiz again directed\r\nhis forces against Hia. After having defeated the Kin army under the\r\nleadership of a son of the sovereign, he captured the Wu-liang-hai Pass\r\nin the Great Wall, and penetrated as far as Ning-sia Fu in Kansuh. With\r\nunceasing vigour he pushed on his troops, and even established his sway\r\nover the province of Liaotung. Several of the Kin commanders, seeing how\r\npersistently victory attended his banners, deserted to him, and\r\ngarrisons surrendered at his bidding. Having thus secured a firm footing\r\nwithin the Great Wall, he despatched three armies in the autumn of 1213\r\nto overrun the empire. The right wing, under his three sons, Juji,\r\nJagatai and Ogotai, marched towards the south; the left wing, under his\r\nbrothers Hochar, Kwang-tsin Noyen and Chow-tse-te-po-shi, advanced\r\neastward towards the sea; while Jenghiz and his son Tule with the centre\r\ndirected their course in a south-easterly direction. Complete success\r\nattended all three expeditions. The right wing advanced as far as Honan,\r\nand after having captured upwards of twenty-eight cities rejoined\r\nheadquarters by the great western road. Hochar made himself master of\r\nthe country as far as Liao-si; and Jenghiz ceased his triumphal career\r\nonly when he reached the cliffs of the Shantung promontory. But either\r\nbecause he was weary of the strife, or because it was necessary to\r\nrevisit his Mongolian empire, he sent an envoy to the Kin emperor in the\r\nspring of the following year (1214), saying, \"All your possessions in\r\nShantung and the whole country north of the Yellow River are now mine\r\nwith the solitary exception of Yenking (the modern Peking). By the\r\ndecree of heaven you are now as weak as I am strong, but I am willing to\r\nretire from my conquests; as a condition of my doing so, however, it\r\nwill be necessary that you distribute largess to my officers and men to\r\nappease their fierce hostility.\" These terms of safety the Kin emperor\r\neagerly accepted, and as a peace offering he presented Jenghiz with a\r\ndaughter of the late emperor, another princess of the imperial house,\r\n500 youths and maidens, and 3000 horses. No sooner, however, had Jenghiz\r\npassed beyond the Great Wall than the Kin emperor, fearing to remain any\r\nlonger so near the Mongol frontier, moved his court to K'ai-fêng Fu in\r\nHonan. This transfer of capital appearing to Jenghiz to indicate a\r\nhostile attitude, he once more marched his troops into the doomed\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nWhile Jenghiz was thus adding city to city and province to province in\r\nChina, Kushlek, the fugitive Naiman chief, was not idle. With\r\ncharacteristic treachery he requested permission from his host, the\r\nKhitan khan, to collect the fragments of his army which had been\r\nscattered by Jenghiz at the battle on the Irtysh, and thus having\r\ncollected a considerable force he leagued himself with Mahommed, the\r\nshah of Khwarizm, against the confiding khan. After a short but decisive\r\ncampaign the allies remained masters of the position, and the khan was\r\ncompelled to abdicate the throne in favour of the late guest.\r\n\r\nWith the power and prestige thus acquired, Kushlek prepared once again\r\nto measure swords with the Mongol chief. On receiving the news of his\r\nhostile preparations, Jenghiz at once took the field, and in the first\r\nbattle routed the Naiman troops and made Kushlek a prisoner. His\r\nill-gotten kingdom became an apanage of the Mongol Empire. Jenghiz now\r\nheld sway up to the Khwarizm frontier. Beyond this he had no immediate\r\ndesire to go, and he therefore sent envoys to Mahommed, the shah, with\r\npresents, saying, \"I send thee greeting; I know thy power and the vast\r\nextent of thine empire; I regard thee as my most cherished son. On my\r\npart thou must know that I have conquered China and all the Turkish\r\nnations north of it; thou knowest that my country is a magazine of\r\nwarriors, a mine of silver, and that I have no need of other lands. I\r\ntake it that we have an equal interest in encouraging trade between our\r\nsubjects.\" This peaceful message was well received by the shah, and in\r\nall probability the Mongol armies would never have appeared in Europe\r\nbut for an unfortunate occurrence. Shortly after the despatch of this\r\nfirst mission Jenghiz sent a party of traders into Transoxiana who were\r\nseized and put to death as spies by Inaljuk, the governor of Otrar. As\r\nsatisfaction for this outrage Jenghiz demanded the extradition of the\r\noffending governor. Far from yielding to this summons, however, Mahommed\r\nbeheaded the chief of the Mongol envoys, and sent the others back\r\nwithout their beards. This insult made war inevitable, and in the spring\r\nof 1219 Jenghiz set out from Karakorum on a campaign which was destined\r\nto be as startling in its immediate results as its ulterior effects were\r\nfar-reaching. The invading force was in the first instance divided into\r\ntwo armies: one commanded by Jenghiz's second son Jagatai was directed\r\nto march against the Kankalis, the northern defenders of the Khwarizm\r\nempire; and the other, led by Juji, his eldest son, advanced by way of\r\nSighnak against Jand (Jend). Against this latter force Mahommed led an\r\narmy of 400,000 men, who were completely routed, leaving it is said\r\n160,000 dead upon the field. With the remnant of his host Mahommed fled\r\nto Samarkand. Meanwhile Jagatai marched down upon the Syr Daria\r\n(Jaxartes) by the pass of Taras and invested Otrar, the offending city.\r\nAfter a siege of five months the citadel was taken by assault, and\r\nInaljuk and his followers were put to the sword. The conquerors levelled\r\nthe walls with the ground, after having given the city over to pillage.\r\nAt the same time a third army besieged and took Khojent on the Jaxartes;\r\nand yet a fourth, led by Jenghiz and his youngest son Tule, advanced in\r\nthe direction of Bokhara. Tashkent and Nur surrendered on their\r\napproach, and after a short siege Bokhara fell into their hands. On\r\nentering the town Jenghiz ascended the steps of the principal mosque,\r\nand shouted to his followers, \"The hay is cut; give your horses fodder.\"\r\nNo second invitation to plunder was needed; the city was sacked, and the\r\ninhabitants either escaped beyond the walls or were compelled to submit\r\nto infamies which were worse than death. As a final act of vengeance the\r\ntown was fired, and before the last of the Mongols left the district,\r\nthe great mosque and certain palaces were the only buildings left to\r\nmark the spot where the \"centre of science\" once stood. From the ruins\r\nof Bokhara Jenghiz advanced along the valley of the Sogd to Samarkand,\r\nwhich, weakened by treachery, surrendered to him, as did also Balkh. But\r\nin neither case did submission save either the inhabitants from\r\nslaughter or the city from pillage. Beyond this point Jenghiz went no\r\nfarther westward, but sent Tule, at the head of 70,000 men, to ravage\r\nKhorasan, and two flying columns under Chepe and Sabutai Bahadar to\r\npursue after Mahommed who had taken refuge in Nishapur. Defeated and\r\nalmost alone, Mahommed fled before his pursuers to the village of Astara\r\non the shore of the Caspian Sea, where he died of an attack of pleurisy,\r\nleaving his empire to his son Jelaleddin (Jalal ud-din). Meanwhile Tule\r\ncarried his arms into the fertile province of Khorasan, and after having\r\ncaptured Nessa by assault appeared before Merv. By an act of atrocious\r\ntreachery the Mongols gained possession of the city, and, after their\r\nmanner, sacked and burnt the town. From Merv Tule marched upon Nishapur,\r\nwhere he met with a most determined resistance. For four days the\r\ngarrison fought desperately on the walls and in the streets, but at\r\nlength they were overpowered, and, with the exception of 400 artisans\r\nwho were sent into Mongolia, every man, woman and child was slain. Herat\r\nescaped the fate which had overtaken Merv and Nishapur by opening its\r\ngates to the Mongols. At this point of his victorious career Tule\r\nreceived an order to join Jenghiz before Talikhan in Badakshan, where\r\nthat chieftain was preparing to renew his pursuit of Jelaleddin, after a\r\ncheck he had sustained in an engagement fought before Ghazni. As soon as\r\nsufficient reinforcements arrived Jenghiz advanced against Jelaleddin,\r\nwho had taken up a position on the banks of the Indus. Here the Turks,\r\nthough far outnumbered, defended their ground with undaunted courage,\r\nuntil, beaten at all points, they fled in confusion. Jelaleddin, seeing\r\nthat all was lost, mounted a fresh horse and jumped into the river,\r\nwhich flowed 20 ft. below. With admiring gaze Jenghiz watched the\r\ndesperate venture of his enemy, and even saw without regret the dripping\r\nhorseman mount the opposite bank. From the Indus Jenghiz sent in pursuit\r\nof Jelaleddin, who fled to Delhi, but failing to capture the fugitive\r\nthe Mongols returned to Ghazni after having ravaged the provinces of\r\nLahore, Peshawar and Melikpur. At this moment news reached Jenghiz that\r\nthe inhabitants of Herat had deposed the governor whom Tule had\r\nappointed over the city, and had placed one of their own choice in his\r\nroom. To punish this act of rebellion Jenghiz sent an army of 80,000 men\r\nagainst the offending city, which after a siege of six months was taken\r\nby assault. For a whole week the Mongols ceased not to kill, burn and\r\ndestroy, and 1,600,000 persons are said to have been massacred within\r\nthe walls. Having consummated this act of vengeance, Jenghiz returned to\r\nMongolia by way of Balkh, Bokhara and Samarkand.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Chepe and Sabutai marched through Azerbeijan, and in the\r\nspring of 1222 advanced into Georgia. Here they defeated a combined\r\nforce of Lesghians, Circassians and Kipchaks, and after taking Astrakhan\r\nfollowed the retreating Kipchaks to the Don. The news of the approach of\r\nthe mysterious enemy of whose name even they were ignorant was received\r\nby the Russian princes at Kiev with dismay. At the instigation, however,\r\nof Mitislaf, prince of Galicia, they assembled an opposing force on the\r\nDnieper. Here they received envoys from the Mongol camp, whom they\r\nbarbarously put to death. \"You have killed our envoys,\" was the answer\r\nmade by the Mongols; \"well, as you wish for war you shall have it. We\r\nhave done you no harm. God is impartial; He will decide our quarrel.\" In\r\nthe first battle, on the river Kaleza, the Russians were utterly routed,\r\nand fled before the invaders, who, after ravaging Great Bulgaria\r\nretired, gorged with booty, through the country of Saksin, along the\r\nriver Aktuba, on their way to Mongolia.\r\n\r\nIn China the same success had attended the Mongol arms as in western\r\nAsia. The whole of the country north of the Yellow river, with the\r\nexception of one or two cities, was added to the Mongol rule, and, on\r\nthe death of the Kin emperor Süan Tsung in 1223, the Kin empire\r\nvirtually ceased to be, and Jenghiz's frontiers thus became conterminous\r\nwith those of the Sung emperors who held sway over the whole of central\r\nand southern China. After his return from Central Asia, Jenghiz once\r\nmore took the field in western China. While on this campaign the five\r\nplanets appeared in a certain conjunction, which to the superstitiously\r\nminded Mongol chief foretold that evil was awaiting him. With this\r\npresentiment strongly impressed upon him he turned his face homewards,\r\nand had advanced no farther than the Si-Kiang river in Kansuh when he\r\nwas seized with an illness of which he died a short time afterwards\r\n(1227) at his travelling palace at Ha-lao-tu, on the banks of the river\r\nSale in Mongolia. By the terms of his will Ogotai was appointed his\r\nsuccessor, but so essential was it considered to be that his death\r\nshould remain a secret until Ogotai was proclaimed that, as the funeral\r\nprocession moved northwards to the great ordu on the banks of the\r\nKerulen, the escort killed every one they met. The body of Jenghiz was\r\nthen carried successively to the ordus of his several wives, and was\r\nfinally laid to rest in the valley of Kilien.\r\n\r\nThus ended the career of one of the greatest conquerors the world has\r\never seen. Born and nurtured as the chief of a petty Mongolian tribe, he\r\nlived to see his armies victorious from the China Sea to the banks of\r\nthe Dnieper; and, though the empire which he created ultimately\r\ndwindled away under the hands of his degenerate descendants, leaving not\r\na wrack behind, we have in the presence of the Turks in Europe a\r\nconsequence of his rule, since it was the advance of his armies which\r\ndrove their Osmanli ancestors from their original home in northern Asia,\r\nand thus led to their invasion of Bithynia under Othman, and finally\r\ntheir advance into Europe under Amurath I.\r\n\r\n  See Sir H. H. Howorth, _The History of the Mongols_; Sir Robert K.\r\n  Douglas, _The Life of Jenghiz Khan_.     (R. K. D.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJENKIN, HENRY CHARLES FLEEMING (1833-1885), British engineer, was born\r\nnear Dungeness on the 25th of March 1833, his father (d. 1885) being a\r\nnaval commander, and his mother (d. 1885) a novelist of some literary\r\nrepute, her best books perhaps being _Cousin Stella_ (1859) and _Who\r\nbreaks, pays_ (1861). Fleeming Jenkin was educated at first in Scotland,\r\nbut in 1846 the family went to live abroad, owing to financial straits,\r\nand he studied at Genoa University, where he took a first-class degree\r\nin physical science. In 1851 he began his engineering career as\r\napprentice in an establishment at Manchester, and subsequently he\r\nentered Newall's submarine cable works at Birkenhead. In 1859 he began,\r\nin concert with Sir William Thomson (afterwards Lord Kelvin), to work on\r\nproblems respecting the making and use of cables, and the importance of\r\nhis researches on the resistance of gutta-percha was at once recognized.\r\nFrom this time he was in constant request in connexion with submarine\r\ntelegraphy, and he became known also as an inventor. In partnership with\r\nThomson, he made a large income as a consulting telegraph engineer. In\r\n1865 he was elected F.R.S., and was appointed professor of engineering\r\nat University College, London. In 1868 he obtained the same\r\nprofessorship at Edinburgh University, and in 1873 he published a\r\ntextbook of _Magnetism and Electricity_, full of original work. He was\r\nauthor of the article \"Bridges\" in the ninth edition of this\r\nencyclopaedia. His influence among the Edinburgh students was\r\npronounced, and R. L. Stevenson's well-known _Memoir_ is a sympathetic\r\ntribute to his ability and character. The meteoric charm of his\r\nconversation is well described in Stevenson's essay on \"Talk and\r\nTalkers,\" under the name of Cockshot. Jenkin's interests were by no\r\nmeans confined to engineering, but extended to the arts and literature;\r\nhis miscellaneous papers, showing his critical and unconventional views,\r\nwere issued posthumously in two volumes (1887). In 1882 Jenkin invented\r\nan automatic method of electric transport for goods--\"telpherage\"--but\r\nthe completion of its details was prevented by his death on the 12th of\r\nJune 1885. A telpher line on his system was subsequently erected at\r\nGlynde in Sussex. He was also well known as a sanitary reformer, and\r\nduring the last ten years of his life he did much useful work in\r\ninculcating more enlightened ideas on the subject both in Edinburgh and\r\nother places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJENKINS, SIR LEOLINE (1623-1685), English lawyer and diplomatist, was\r\nthe son of a Welsh country gentleman. He was born in 1623 and was\r\neducated at Jesus College, Oxford, of which he was elected a fellow at\r\nthe Restoration in 1660, having been an ardent royalist during the civil\r\nwar and commonwealth; and in 1661 he became head of the college. In the\r\nsame year he was made registrar of the consistory court of Westminster;\r\nin 1664 deputy judge of the court of arches; about a year later judge of\r\nthe admiralty court; in 1689 judge of the prerogative court of\r\nCanterbury. In these offices Jenkins did enduring work in elucidating\r\nand establishing legal principles, especially in relation to\r\ninternational law and admiralty jurisdiction. He was selected to draw up\r\nthe claim of Charles II. to succeed to the property of his mother,\r\nHenrietta Maria, on her death in August 1666, and while in Paris for\r\nthis purpose he succeeded in defeating the rival claim of the duchess of\r\nOrleans, being rewarded by a knighthood on his return. In 1673, on being\r\nelected member for Hythe, Jenkins resigned the headship of Jesus\r\nCollege. He was one of the English representatives at the congress of\r\nCologne in 1673, and at the more important congress of Nijmwegen in\r\n1676-1679. He was made a privy councillor in February 1680 and became\r\nsecretary of state in April of the same year, in which office he was the\r\nofficial leader of the opposition to the Exclusion Bill, though he was\r\nby no means a pliant tool in the hands of the court. He resigned office\r\nin 1684, and died on the 1st of September 1685. He left most of his\r\nproperty to Jesus College, Oxford, including his books, which he\r\nbequeathed to the college library, built by himself; and he left some\r\nimportant manuscripts to All Souls College, where they are preserved.\r\nJenkins left his impress on the law of England in the Statute of Frauds,\r\nand the Statute of Distributions, of which he was the principal author,\r\nand of which the former profoundly affected the mercantile law of the\r\ncountry, while the latter regulated the inheritance of the personal\r\nproperty of intestates. He was never married.\r\n\r\n  See William Wynne, _Life of Sir Leoline Jenkins_ (2 vols., London,\r\n  1724), which contains a number of his diplomatic despatches, letters,\r\n  speeches and other papers. See also Sir William Temple, _Works_, vol.\r\n  ii. (4 vols., 1770); Anthony à Wood, _Athenae Oxonienses_ (Fasti)\r\n  edited by P. Bliss (4 vols., London, 1813-1820), and _History and\r\n  Antiquities of the University of Oxford_, edited by J. Gutch (Oxford,\r\n  1792-1796).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJENKINS, ROBERT (fl. 1731-1745), English master mariner, is known as the\r\nprotagonist of the \"Jenkins's ear\" incident, which, magnified in England\r\nby the press and the opposition, became a contributory cause of the war\r\nbetween England and Spain (1739). Bringing home the brig \"Rebecca\" from\r\nthe West Indies in 1731, Jenkins was boarded by a Spanish guarda-costa,\r\nwhose commander rifled the holds and cut off one of his ears. On\r\narriving in England Jenkins stated his grievance to the king, and a\r\nreport was furnished by the commander-in-chief in the West Indies\r\nconfirming his account. At first the case created no great stir, but in\r\n1738 he repeated his story with dramatic detail before a committee of\r\nthe House of Commons, producing what purported to be the ear that had\r\nbeen cut off. Afterwards it was suggested that he might have lost the\r\near in the pillory.\r\n\r\n  Jenkins was subsequently given the command of a ship in the East India\r\n  Company's service, and later became supervisor of the company's\r\n  affairs at St Helena. In 1741 he was sent from England to that island\r\n  to investigate charges of corruption brought against the acting\r\n  governor, and from May 1741 until March 1742 he administered the\r\n  affairs of the island. Thereafter he resumed his naval career, and is\r\n  stated in an action with a pirate vessel to have preserved his own\r\n  vessel and three others under his care (see T. H. Brooke, _History of\r\n  the Island of St Helena_ (London, 2nd ed., 1824), and H. R. Janisch,\r\n  _Extracts from the St Helena Records_, 1885).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJENKS, JEREMIAH WHIPPLE (1856-   ), American economist, was born in St\r\nClair, Michigan, on the 2nd of September 1856. He graduated at the\r\nuniversity of Michigan in 1878; taught Greek, Latin and German in Mt.\r\nMorris College, Illinois; studied in Germany, receiving the degree of\r\nPh.D. from the university of Halle in 1885; taught political science and\r\nEnglish literature at Knox College, Galesburg, Ill., in 1886-1889; was\r\nprofessor of political economy and social science at Indiana State\r\nUniversity in 1889-1891; and was successively professor of political,\r\nmunicipal and social institutions (1891-1892), professor of political\r\neconomy and civil and social institutions (1892-1901), and after 1901\r\nprofessor of political economy and politics at Cornell University. In\r\n1899-1901 he served as an expert agent of the United States industrial\r\ncommission on investigation of trusts and industrial combinations in the\r\nUnited States and Europe, and contributed to vols. i., viii. and xiii.\r\nof this commission's report (1900 and 1901), vol. viii. being a report,\r\nwritten wholly by him, on industrial combinations in Europe. In\r\n1901-1902 he was special commissioner of the United States war\r\ndepartment on colonial administration, and wrote a _Report on Certain\r\nEconomic Questions in the English and Dutch Colonies in the Orient_,\r\npublished (1902) by the bureau of insular affairs; and in 1903 he was\r\nadviser to the Mexican ministry of finance on projected currency\r\nchanges. In 1903-1904 he was a member of the United States commission on\r\ninternational exchange, in especial charge of the reform of currency in\r\nChina; in 1905 he was special representative of the United States with\r\nthe imperial Chinese special mission visiting the United States. In 1907\r\nhe became a member of the United States immigration commission. Best\r\nknown as an expert on \"trusts,\" he has written besides on elections,\r\nballot reform, proportional representation, on education (especially as\r\na training for citizenship), on legislation regarding highways, &c.\r\n\r\n  His principal published works are _Henry C. Carey als Nationalökonom_\r\n  (Halle a. S., 1885); _The Trust Problem_ (1900; revised 1903); _Great\r\n  Fortunes_ (1906); _Citizenship and the Schools_ (1906); and\r\n  _Principles of Politics_ (1909).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJENNÉ, a city of West Africa, formerly the capital of the Songhoi\r\nempire, now included in the French colony of Upper Senegal and Niger.\r\nJenné is situated on a marigot or natural canal connecting the Niger and\r\nits affluent the Bani or Mahel Balevel, and is within a few miles of the\r\nlatter stream. It lies 250 m. S.W. of Timbuktu in a straight line. The\r\ncity is surrounded by channels connected with the Bani but in the dry\r\nseason it ceases to be an island. On the north is the Moorish quarter;\r\non the north-west, the oldest part of the city, stood the citadel,\r\nconverted by the French since 1893 into a modern fort. The market-place\r\nis midway between the fort and the commercial harbour. The old mosque,\r\npartially destroyed in 1830, covered a large area in the south-west\r\nportion of the city. It was built on the site of the ancient palace of\r\nthe Songhoi kings. The architecture of many of the buildings bears a\r\nresemblance to Egyptian, the façades of the houses being adorned with\r\ngreat buttresses of pylonic form. There is little trace of the influence\r\nof Moorish or Arabian art. The buildings are mostly constructed of clay\r\nmade into flat long bricks. Massive clay walls surround the city. The\r\ninhabitants are great traders and the principal merchants have\r\nrepresentatives at Timbuktu and all the chief places on the Niger. The\r\nboats built at Jenné are famous throughout the western Sudan.\r\n\r\nJenné is believed to have been founded by the Songhoi in the 8th\r\ncentury, and though it has passed under the dominion of many races it\r\nhas never been destroyed. Jenné seems to have been at the height of its\r\npower from the 12th to the 16th century, when its merchandise was found\r\nat every port along the west coast of Africa. From this circumstance it\r\nis conjectured that Jenné (Guinea) gave its name to the whole coast (see\r\nGUINEA). Subsequently, under the control of Moorish, Tuareg and Fula\r\ninvaders, the importance of the city greatly declined. With the advent\r\nof the French, commerce again began to flourish.\r\n\r\n  See F. Dubois, _Tombouctou la mystérieuse_ (Paris, 1897), in which\r\n  several chapters are devoted to Jenné; also SONGHOI; TIMBUKTU; and\r\n  SENEGAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJENNER, EDWARD (1749-1823), English physician and discoverer of\r\nvaccination, was born at Berkeley, Gloucestershire, on the 17th of May\r\n1749. His father, the Rev. Stephen Jenner, rector of Rockhampton and\r\nvicar of Berkeley, came of a family that had been long established in\r\nthat county, and was possessed of considerable landed property; he died\r\nwhen Edward was only six years old, but his eldest son, the Rev. Stephen\r\nJenner, brought his brother up with paternal care and tenderness. Edward\r\nreceived his early education at Wotton-under-Edge and Cirencester, where\r\nhe already showed a strong taste for natural history. The medical\r\nprofession having been selected for him, he began his studies under\r\nDaniel Ludlow, a surgeon of Sodbury near Bristol; but in his\r\ntwenty-first year he proceeded to London, where he became a favourite\r\npupil of John Hunter, in whose house he resided for two years. During\r\nthis period he was employed by Sir Joseph Banks to arrange and prepare\r\nthe valuable zoological specimens which he had brought back from Captain\r\nCook's first voyage in 1771. He must have acquitted himself\r\nsatisfactorily in this task, since he was offered the post of naturalist\r\nin the second expedition, but declined it as well as other advantageous\r\noffers, preferring rather to practise his profession in his native\r\nplace, and near his eldest brother, to whom he was much attached. He was\r\nthe principal founder of a local medical society, to which he\r\ncontributed several papers of marked ability, in one of which he\r\napparently anticipated later discoveries concerning rheumatic\r\ninflammations of the heart. He maintained a correspondence with John\r\nHunter, under whose direction he investigated various points in biology,\r\nparticularly the hibernation of hedgehogs and habits of the cuckoo; his\r\npaper on the latter subject was laid by Hunter before the Royal Society,\r\nand appeared in the _Phil. Trans._ for 1788. He also devoted\r\nconsiderable attention to the varied geological character of the\r\ndistrict in which he lived, and constructed the first balloon seen in\r\nthose parts. He was a great favourite in general society, from his\r\nagreeable and instructive conversation, and the many accomplishments he\r\npossessed. Thus he was a fair musician, both as a part singer and as a\r\nperformer on the violin and flute, and a very successful writer, after\r\nthe fashion of that time, of fugitive pieces of verse. In 1788 he\r\nmarried Catherine Kingscote, and in 1792 he obtained the degree of\r\ndoctor of medicine from St Andrews.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the discovery that is associated with his name had been slowly\r\nmaturing in his mind. When only an apprentice at Sodbury, his attention\r\nhad been directed to the relations between cow-pox and small-pox in\r\nconnexion with a popular belief which he found current in\r\nGloucestershire, as to the antagonism between these two diseases. During\r\nhis stay in London he appears to have mentioned the thing repeatedly to\r\nHunter, who, being engrossed by other important pursuits, was not so\r\nstrongly persuaded as Jenner was of its possible importance, yet spoke\r\nof it to his friends and in his lectures. After he began practice in\r\nBerkeley, Jenner was always accustomed to inquire what his professional\r\nbrethren thought of it; but he found that, when medical men had noticed\r\nthe popular report at all, they supposed it to be based on imperfect\r\ninduction. His first careful investigation of the subject dated from\r\nabout 1775, and five years elapsed before he had succeeded in clearing\r\naway the most perplexing difficulties by which it was surrounded. He\r\nfirst satisfied himself that two different forms of disease had been\r\nhitherto confounded under the term cow-pox, only one of which protected\r\nagainst small-pox, and that many of the cases of failure were to be thus\r\naccounted for; and his next step was to ascertain that the true cow-pox\r\nitself only protects when communicated at a particular stage of the\r\ndisease. At the same time he came to the conclusion that \"the grease\" of\r\nhorses is the same disease as cow-pox and small-pox, each being modified\r\nby the organism in which it was developed. For many years, cow-pox being\r\nscarce in his county, he had no opportunity of inoculating the disease,\r\nand so putting his discovery to the test, but he did all he could in the\r\nway of collecting information and communicating what he had ascertained.\r\nThus in 1788 he carried a drawing of the cow-pox, as seen on the hands\r\nof a milkmaid, to London, and showed it to Sir E. Home and others, who\r\nagreed that it was \"an interesting and curious subject.\" At length, on\r\nthe 14th of May 1796, he was able to inoculate James Phipps, a boy about\r\neight years old, with matter from cow-pox vesicles on the hand of Sarah\r\nNelmes. On the 1st of the following July the boy was carefully\r\ninoculated with variolous matter, but (as Jenner had predicted) no\r\nsmall-pox followed. The discovery was now complete, but Jenner was\r\nunable to repeat his experiment until 1798, owing to the disappearance\r\nof cow-pox from the dairies. He then repeated his inoculations with the\r\nutmost care, and prepared a pamphlet (_Inquiry into the Cause and\r\nEffects of the Variolae Vaccinae_) which should announce his discovery\r\nto the world. Before publishing it, however, he thought it well to visit\r\nLondon, so as to demonstrate the truth of his assertions to his friends;\r\nbut he remained in London nearly three months, without being able to\r\nfind any person who would submit to be vaccinated. Soon after he had\r\nreturned home, however, Henry Cline, surgeon of St Thomas's Hospital,\r\ninoculated some vaccine matter obtained from him over the diseased\r\nhip-joint of a child, thinking the counter-irritation might be useful,\r\nand found the patient afterwards incapable of acquiring small-pox. In\r\nthe autumn of the same year, Jenner met with the first opposition to\r\nvaccination; and this was the more formidable because it proceeded from\r\nJ. Ingenhousz, a celebrated physician and man of science. But meanwhile\r\nCline's advocacy of vaccination brought it much more decidedly before\r\nthe medical profession, of whom the majority were prudent enough to\r\nsuspend their judgment until they had more ample information. But\r\nbesides these there were two noisy and troublesome factions, one of\r\nwhich opposed vaccination as a useless and dangerous practice, while the\r\nother endangered its success much more by rash and self-seeking\r\nadvocacy. At the head of the latter was George Pearson, who in November\r\n1798 published a pamphlet speculating upon the subject, before even\r\nseeing a case of cow-pox, and afterwards endeavoured, by lecturing on\r\nthe subject and supplying the virus, to put himself forward as the chief\r\nagent in the cause. The matter which he distributed, which had been\r\nderived from cows that were found to be infected in London, was found\r\nfrequently to produce, not the slight disease described by Jenner, but\r\nmore or less severe eruptions resembling small-pox. Jenner concluded at\r\nonce that this was due to an accidental contamination of the vaccine\r\nwith variolous matter, and a visit to London in the spring of 1799\r\nconvinced him that this was the case. In the course of this year the\r\npractice of vaccination spread over England, being urged principally by\r\nnon-professional persons of position; and towards its close attempts\r\nwere made to found institutions for gratuitous vaccination and for\r\nsupplying lymph to all who might apply for it. Pearson proposed to\r\nestablish one of these in London, without Jenner's knowledge, in which\r\nhe offered him the post of honorary corresponding physician! On learning\r\nof this scheme to supplant him, and to carry on an institution for\r\npublic vaccination on principles which he knew to be partly erroneous,\r\nJenner once more visited London early in 1800, when he had influence\r\nenough to secure the abandonment of the project. He was afterwards\r\npresented to the king, the queen and the prince of Wales, whose\r\nencouragement materially aided the spread of vaccination in England.\r\nMeanwhile it had made rapid progress in the United States, where it was\r\nintroduced by Benjamin Waterhouse, then professor of physic at Harvard,\r\nand on the continent of Europe, where it was at first diffused by De\r\nCarro of Vienna. In consequence of the war between England and France,\r\nthe discovery was later in reaching Paris; but, its importance once\r\nrealized, it spread rapidly over France, Spain and Italy.\r\n\r\nA few of the incidents connected with its extension may be mentioned.\r\nPerhaps the most striking is the expedition which was sent out by the\r\ncourt of Spain in 1803, for the purpose of diffusing cow-pox through all\r\nthe Spanish possessions in the Old and New Worlds, and which returned in\r\nthree years, having circumnavigated the globe, and succeeded beyond its\r\nutmost expectations. Clergymen in Geneva and Holland urged vaccination\r\nupon their parishioners from the pulpit; in Sicily, South America and\r\nNaples religious processions were formed for the purpose of receiving\r\nit; the anniversary of Jenner's birthday, or of the successful\r\nvaccination of James Phipps, was for many years celebrated as a feast in\r\nGermany; and the empress of Russia caused the first child operated upon\r\nto receive the name of Vaccinov, and to be educated at the public\r\nexpense. About the close of the year 1801 Jenner's friends in\r\nGloucestershire presented him with a small service of plate as a\r\ntestimonial of the esteem in which they held his discovery. This was\r\nintended merely as a preliminary to the presenting of a petition to\r\nparliament for a grant. The petition was presented in 1802, and was\r\nreferred to a committee, of which the investigations resulted in a\r\nreport in favour of the grant, and ultimately in a vote of £10,000.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1802 steps were taken to form a society for the\r\nproper spread of vaccination in London, and the Royal Jennerian Society\r\nwas finally established, Jenner returning to town to preside at the\r\nfirst meeting. This institution began very prosperously, more than\r\ntwelve thousand persons having been inoculated in the first eighteen\r\nmonths, and with such effect that the deaths from small-pox, which for\r\nthe latter half of the 18th century had averaged 2018 annually, fell in\r\n1804 to 622. Unfortunately the chief resident inoculator soon set\r\nhimself up as an authority opposed to Jenner, and this led to such\r\ndissensions as caused the society to die out in 1808.\r\n\r\nJenner was led, by the language of the chancellor of the exchequer when\r\nhis grant was proposed, to attempt practice in London, but after a\r\nyear's trial he returned to Berkeley. His grant was not paid until 1804,\r\nand then, after the deduction of about £1000 for fees, it did little\r\nmore than pay the expenses attendant upon his discovery. For he was so\r\nthoroughly known everywhere as the discoverer of vaccination that, as he\r\nhimself said, he was \"the vaccine clerk of the whole world.\" At the\r\nsame time he continued to vaccinate gratuitously all the poor who\r\napplied to him on certain days, so that he sometimes had as many as\r\nthree hundred persons waiting at his door. Meanwhile honours began to\r\nshower upon him from abroad: he was elected a member of almost all the\r\nchief scientific societies on the continent of Europe, the first being\r\nthat of Göttingen, where he was proposed by J. F. Blumenbach. But\r\nperhaps the most flattering proof of his influence was derived from\r\nFrance. On one occasion, when he was endeavouring to obtain the release\r\nof some of the unfortunate Englishmen who had been detained in France on\r\nthe sudden termination of the Peace of Amiens, Napoleon was about to\r\nreject the petition, when Josephine uttered the name of Jenner. The\r\nemperor paused and exclaimed: \"Ah, we can refuse nothing to that name.\"\r\nSomewhat later he did the same service to Englishmen confined in Mexico\r\nand in Austria; and during the latter part of the great war persons\r\nbefore leaving England would sometimes obtain certificates signed by him\r\nwhich served as passports. In his own country his merits were less\r\nrecognized. His applications on behalf of French prisoners in England\r\nwere less successful; he never shared in any of the patronage at the\r\ndisposal of the government, and was even unable to obtain a living for\r\nhis nephew George.\r\n\r\nIn 1806 Lord Henry Petty (afterwards the marquess of Lansdowne) became\r\nchancellor of the exchequer, and was so convinced of the inadequacy of\r\nthe former parliamentary grant that he proposed an address to the Crown,\r\npraying that the college of physicians should be directed to report upon\r\nthe success of vaccination. Their report being strongly in its favour,\r\nthe then chancellor of the exchequer (Spencer Perceval) proposed that a\r\nsum of £10,000 without any deductions should be paid to Jenner. The\r\nanti-vaccinationists found but one advocate in the House of Commons; and\r\nfinally the sum was raised to £20,000. Jenner, however, at the same time\r\nhad the mortification of learning that government did not intend to take\r\nany steps towards checking small-pox inoculation, which so persistently\r\nkept up that disease. About the same time a subscription for his benefit\r\nwas begun in India, where his discovery had been gratefully received,\r\nbut the full amount of this (£7383) only reached him in 1812.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Jennerian Society having failed, the national vaccine\r\nestablishment was founded, for the extension of vaccination, in 1808.\r\nJenner spent five months in London for the purpose of organizing it, but\r\nwas then obliged, by the dangerous illness of one of his sons, to return\r\nto Berkeley. He had been appointed director of the institution; but he\r\nhad no sooner left London than Sir Lucas Pepys, president of the college\r\nof physicians, neglected his recommendations, and formed the board out\r\nof the officials of that college and the college of surgeons. Jenner at\r\nonce resigned his post as director, though he continued to give the\r\nbenefit of his advice whenever it was needed, and this resignation was a\r\nbitter mortification to him. In 1810 his eldest son died, and Jenner's\r\ngrief at his loss, and his incessant labours, materially affected his\r\nhealth. In 1813 the university of Oxford conferred on him the degree of\r\nM.D. It was believed that this would lead to his election into the\r\ncollege of physicians, but that learned body decided that he could not\r\nbe admitted until he had undergone an examination in classics. This\r\nJenner at once refused; to brush up his classics would, he said, \"be\r\nirksome beyond measure. I would not do it for a diadem. That indeed\r\nwould be a bauble; I would not do it for John Hunter's museum.\"\r\n\r\nHe visited London for the last time in 1814, when he was presented to\r\nthe Allied Sovereigns and to most of the principal personages who\r\naccompanied them. In the next year his wife's death was the signal for\r\nhim to retire from public life: he never left Berkeley again, except for\r\na day or two, as long as he lived. He found sufficient occupation for\r\nthe remainder of his life in collecting further evidence on some points\r\nconnected with his great discovery, and in his engagements as a\r\nphysician, a naturalist and a magistrate. In 1818 a severe epidemic of\r\nsmall-pox prevailed, and fresh doubts were thrown on the efficacy of\r\nvaccination, in part apparently owing to the bad quality of the vaccine\r\nlymph employed. This caused Jenner much annoyance, which was relieved by\r\nan able defence of the practice, written by Sir Gilbert Blane. But this\r\nled him, in 1821, to send a circular letter to most of the medical men\r\nin the kingdom inquiring into the effect of other skin diseases in\r\nmodifying the progress of cow-pox. A year later he published his last\r\nwork, _On the Influence of Artificial Eruptions in Certain Diseases_;\r\nand in 1823 he presented his last paper--\"On the Migration of Birds\"--to\r\nthe Royal Society. On the 24th of January 1823 he retired to rest\r\napparently as well as usual, and next morning rose and came down to his\r\nlibrary, where he was found insensible on the floor, in a state of\r\napoplexy, and with the right side paralysed. He never rallied, and died\r\non the following morning.\r\n\r\nA public subscription was set on foot, shortly after his death, by the\r\nmedical men of his county, for the purpose of erecting some memorial in\r\nhis honour, and with much difficulty a sufficient sum was raised to\r\nenable a statue to be placed in Gloucester Cathedral. In 1850 another\r\nattempt was made to set up a monument to him; this appears to have\r\nfailed, but at length, in 1858, a statue of him was erected by public\r\nsubscription in London.\r\n\r\n  Jenner's life was written by the intimate friend of his later years,\r\n  Dr John Baron of Gloucester (2 vols., 1827, 1838). See also\r\n  Vaccination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJENNER, SIR WILLIAM, BART. (1815-1898), English physician, was born at\r\nChatham on the 30th of January 1815, and educated at University College,\r\nLondon. He became M.R.C.S. in 1837, and F.R.C.P. in 1852, and in 1844\r\ntook the London M.D. In 1847 he began at the London fever hospital\r\ninvestigations into cases of \"continued\" fever which enabled him finally\r\nto make the distinction between typhus and typhoid on which his\r\nreputation as a pathologist principally rests. In 1849 he was appointed\r\nprofessor of pathological anatomy at University College, and also\r\nassistant physician to University College Hospital, where he afterwards\r\nbecame physician (1854-1876) and consulting physician (1879), besides\r\nholding similar appointments at other hospitals. He was also\r\nsuccessively Holme professor of clinical medicine and professor of the\r\nprinciples and practice of medicine at University College. He was\r\npresident of the college of physicians (1881-1888); he was elected\r\nF.R.S. in 1864, and received honorary degrees from Oxford, Cambridge and\r\nEdinburgh. In 1861 he was appointed physician extraordinary, and in 1862\r\nphysician in ordinary, to Queen Victoria, and in 1863 physician in\r\nordinary to the prince of Wales; he attended both the prince consort and\r\nthe prince of Wales in their attacks of typhoid fever. In 1868 he was\r\ncreated a baronet. As a consultant Sir William Jenner had a great\r\nreputation, and he left a large fortune when he died, at Bishop's\r\nWaltham, Hants, on the 11th of December 1898, having then retired from\r\npractice for eight years owing to failing health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJENNET, a small Spanish horse; the word is sometimes applied in English\r\nto a mule, the offspring of a she-ass and a stallion. Jennet comes,\r\nthrough Fr. _genet_, from Span, _jinete_, a light horseman who rides _à\r\nla gineta_, explained as \"with his legs tucked up.\" The name is taken to\r\nbe a corruption of the Arabic Zenata, a Berber tribe famed for its\r\ncavalry. English and French transferred the word from the rider to his\r\nhorse, a meaning which the word has only acquired in Spain in modern\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJENOLAN CAVES, a series of remarkable caverns in Roxburgh county, New\r\nSouth Wales, Australia; 113 m. W. by N. of Sydney, and 36 m. from\r\nTarana, which is served by railway. They are the most celebrated of\r\nseveral similar groups in the limestone of the country; they have not\r\nyielded fossils of great interest, but the stalactitic formations,\r\nsometimes pure white, are of extraordinary beauty. The caves have been\r\nrendered easily accessible to visitors and lighted by electricity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJENSEN, WILHELM (1837-   ), German author, was born at Heiligenhafen in\r\nHolstein on the 15th of February 1837, the son of a local Danish\r\nmagistrate, who came of old patrician Frisian stock. After attending the\r\nclassical schools at Kiel and Lübeck, Jensen studied medicine at the\r\nuniversities of Kiel, Würzburg and Breslau. He, however, abandoned the\r\nmedical profession for that of letters, and after engaging for some\r\nyears in individual private study proceeded to Munich, where he\r\nassociated with men of letters. After a residence in Stuttgart\r\n(1865-1869), where for a short time he conducted the _Schwäbische\r\nVolks-Zeitung_, he became editor in Flensburg of the _Norddeutsche\r\nZeitung_. In 1872 he again returned to Kiel, lived from 1876 to 1888 in\r\nFreiburg im Breisgau, and since 1888 has been resident in Munich.\r\n\r\n  Jensen is perhaps the most fertile of modern German writers of\r\n  fiction, more than one hundred works having proceeded from his pen;\r\n  but only comparatively few of them have caught the public taste; such\r\n  are the novels, _Karin von Schweden_ (Berlin, 1878); _Die braune\r\n  Erica_ (Berlin, 1868); and the tale, _Die Pfeifer von Dusenbach, Eine\r\n  Geschichte aus dem Elsass_ (1884). Among others may be mentioned:\r\n  _Barthenia_ (Berlin, 1877); _Götz und Gisela_ (Berlin, 1886);\r\n  _Heimkunft_ (Dresden, 1894); _Aus See und Sand_ (Dresden, 1897); _Luv\r\n  und Lee_ (Berlin, 1897); and the narratives, _Aus den Tagen der Hansa_\r\n  (Leipzig, 1885); _Aus stiller Zeit_ (Berlin, 1881-1885); and _Heimath_\r\n  (1901). Jensen also published some tragedies, among which _Dido_\r\n  (Berlin, 1870) and _Der Kampf für's Reich_ (Freiburg im Br., 1884) may\r\n  be mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJENYNS, SOAME (1704-1787), English author, was born in London on the 1st\r\nof January 1704, and was educated at St John's College, Cambridge. In\r\n1742 he was chosen M.P. for Cambridgeshire, in which his property lay,\r\nand he afterwards sat for the borough of Dunwich and the town of\r\nCambridge. From 1755 to 1780 he was one of the commissioners of the\r\nboard of trade. He died on the 18th of December 1787.\r\n\r\nFor the measure of literary repute which he enjoyed during his life\r\nJenyns was indebted as much to his wealth and social standing as to his\r\naccomplishments and talents, though both were considerable. His poetical\r\nworks, the _Art of Dancing_ (1727) and _Miscellanies_ (1770), contain\r\nmany passages graceful and lively though occasionally verging on\r\nlicence. The first of his prose works was his _Free Inquiry into the\r\nNature and Origin of Evil_ (1756). This essay was severely criticized on\r\nits appearance, especially by Samuel Johnson in the _Literary Magazine_.\r\nJohnson, in a slashing review--the best paper of the kind he ever\r\nwrote--condemned the book as a slight and shallow attempt to solve one\r\nof the most difficult of moral problems. Jenyns, a gentle and amiable\r\nman in the main, was extremely irritated by his failure. He put forth a\r\nsecond edition of his work, prefaced by a vindication, and tried to take\r\nvengeance on Johnson after his death by a sarcastic epitaph.[1] In 1776\r\nJenyns published his _View of the Internal Evidence of the Christian\r\nReligion_. Though at one period of his life he had affected a kind of\r\ndeistic scepticism, he had now returned to orthodoxy, and there seems no\r\nreason to doubt his sincerity, questioned at the time, in defending\r\nChristianity on the ground of its total variance with the principles of\r\nhuman reason. The work was deservedly praised in its day for its\r\nliterary merits, but is so plainly the production of an amateur in\r\ntheology that as a scientific treatise it is valueless.\r\n\r\n  A collected edition of the works of Jenyns appeared in 1790, with a\r\n  biography by Charles Nalson Cole. There are several references to him\r\n  in Boswell's _Johnson_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] Two lines will suffice:--\r\n\r\n    Boswell and Thrale, retailers of his wit,\r\n    Will tell you how he wrote, and talk'd, and cough'd, and spit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEOPARDY, a term meaning risk or danger of death, loss or other injury.\r\nThe word, in Mid. Eng. _juparti_, _jeupartie_, &c., was adapted from O.\r\nFr. _ju_, later _jeu_, and _parti_, even game, in medieval Latin _jocus\r\npartitus_. This term was originally used of a problem in chess or of a\r\nstage in any other game at which the chances of success or failure are\r\nevenly divided between the players. It was thus early transformed to any\r\nstate of uncertainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEPHSON, ROBERT (1736-1803), British dramatist, was born in Ireland.\r\nAfter serving for some years in the British army, he retired with the\r\nrank of captain, and lived in England, where he was the friend of\r\nGarrick, Reynolds, Goldsmith, Johnson, Burke, Burney and Charles\r\nTownshend. His appointment as master of the horse to the lord-lieutenant\r\nof Ireland took him back to Dublin. He published, in the _Mercury_\r\nnewspaper a series of articles in defence of the lord-lieutenant's\r\nadministration which were afterwards collected and issued in book form\r\nunder the title of _The Bachelor, or Speculations of Jeoffry Wagstaffe_.\r\nA pension of £300, afterwards doubled, was granted him, and he held his\r\nappointment under twelve succeeding viceroys. From 1775 he was engaged\r\nin the writing of plays. Among others, his tragedy _Braganza_ was\r\nsuccessfully performed at Drury Lane in 1775, _Conspiracy_ in 1796, _The\r\nLaw of Lombardy_ in 1779, and _The Count of Narbonne_ at Covent Garden\r\nin 1781. In 1794 he published an heroic poem _Roman Portraits_, and _The\r\nConfessions of Jacques Baptiste Couteau_, a satire on the excesses of\r\nthe French Revolution. He died at Blackrock, near Dublin, on the 31st of\r\nMay 1803.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEPHTHAH, one of the judges of Israel, in the Bible, was an illegitimate\r\nson of Gilead, and, being expelled from his father's house by his lawful\r\nbrethren, took refuge in the Syrian land of Tob, where he gathered\r\naround him a powerful band of homeless men like himself. The Ammonites\r\npressing hard on his countrymen, the elders of Gilead called for his\r\nhelp, which he consented to give on condition that in the event of\r\nvictory he should be made their head (Judg. xi. 1-xii. 7). His name is\r\nbest known in history and literature in connexion with his vow, which\r\nled to the sacrifice of his daughter on his successful return. The\r\nreluctance shown by many writers in accepting the plain sense of the\r\nnarrative on this point proceeds to a large extent on unwarranted\r\nassumptions as to the stage of ethical development which had been\r\nreached in Israel in the period of the judges, or at the time when the\r\nnarrative took shape. The annual lamentation of the women for her death\r\nsuggests a mythical origin (see Adonis). Attached to the narrative is an\r\naccount of a quarrel between Jephthah and the Ephraimites. The latter\r\nwere defeated, and their retreat was cut off by the Gileadites, who had\r\nseized the fords of the Jordan. As the fugitives attempted to cross they\r\nwere bidden to say \"shibboleth\" (\"flood\" or \"ear of corn\"), and those\r\nwho said \"sibboleth\" (the Ephraimites apparently being unused to _sh_),\r\nwere at once put to death. In this way 42,000 of the tribe were\r\nkilled.[1]\r\n\r\n  The loose connexion between this and the main narrative, as also the\r\n  lengthy speech to the children of Ammon (xi. 14-27), which really\r\n  relates to Moab, has led some writers to infer that two distinct\r\n  heroes and situations have been combined. See further the commentaries\r\n  on the Book of Judges (q.v.), and Cheyne, _Ency. Bib._, art.\r\n  \"Jephthah.\"     (S. A. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] Similarly a Syrian story tells how the Druses came to slay\r\n    Ibrahim Pasha's troops, and desiring to spare the Syrians ordered the\r\n    men to say _gamal_ (camel). As the Syrians pronounce the _g_ soft,\r\n    and the Egyptians the _g_, hard, the former were easily identified.\r\n    Other examples from the East will be found in H. C. Kay, _Yaman_, p.\r\n    36, and in S. Lane-Poole, _History of Egypt in the Middle Ages_, p.\r\n    300. Also, at the Sicilian Vespers (March 13, 1282) the French were\r\n    made to betray themselves by their pronunciation of _ceci_ and\r\n    _ciceri_ (Ital. _c_ like _tch_; Fr. _c_ like _s_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJERAHMEEL, (Heb. \"May God pity\"), in the Bible, a clan which with Caleb,\r\nthe Kenites and others, occupied the southern steppes of Palestine,\r\nprobably in the district around Arad, about 17 m. S. of Hebron. It was\r\non friendly terms with David during his residence at Ziklag (1 Sam. xxx.\r\n29), and it was apparently in his reign that the various elements of the\r\nsouth were united and were reckoned to Israel. This is expressed in the\r\nchronicler's genealogies which make Jerahmeel and Caleb descendants of\r\nJudah (see DAVID; JUDAH).\r\n\r\n  On the names in 1 Chron. ii. see S. A. Cook, _Ency. Bib._, col. 2363\r\n  seq. Peleth (v. 33) may be the origin of the Pelethites (2 Sam. viii.\r\n  18; xv. 18; xx. 7), and since the name occurs in the revolt of Korah\r\n  (Num. xvi. 1), it is possible that Jerahmeel, like Caleb and the\r\n  Kenites, had moved northwards from Kadesh. Samuel (q.v.) was of\r\n  Jerahmeel (1 Sam. i. 1; Septuagint), and the consecutive Jerahmeelite\r\n  names Nathan and Zabad (1 Chron. ii. 36) have been associated with the\r\n  prophet and officer (Zabud, 1 Kings iv. 5) of the times of David and\r\n  Solomon respectively. The association of Samuel and Nathan with this\r\n  clan, if correct, is a further illustration of the importance of the\r\n  south for the growth of biblical history (see KENITES and RECHABITES).\r\n  The _Chronicles of Jerahmeel_ (M. Gaster, _Oriental Translation Fund_,\r\n  1899) is a late production containing a number of apocryphal Jewish\r\n  legends of no historical value.     (S. A. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJERBA, an island off the coast of North Africa in the Gulf of Gabes,\r\nforming part of the regency of Tunisia. It is separated from the\r\nmainland by two narrow straits, and save for these channels blocks the\r\nentrance to a large bight identified with the Lake Triton of the Romans.\r\nThe western strait, opening into the Gulf of Gabes, is a mile and a half\r\nbroad; the eastern strait is wider, but at low water it is possible to\r\ncross to the mainland by the Tarik-el-Jemil (road of the camel). The\r\nisland is irregular in outline, its greatest length and breadth being\r\nsome 20 m., and its area 425 sq. m. It contains neither rivers nor\r\nsprings, but is supplied with water by wells and cisterns. It is flat\r\nand well wooded with date palms and olive trees. Pop. 35,000 to 40,000,\r\nthe bulk of the inhabitants being Berbers. Though many of them have\r\nadopted Arabic a Berber idiom is commonly spoken. An affinity exists\r\nbetween the Berbers of Jerba and the Beni Mzab. About 3000 Jews live\r\napart in villages of their own, and some 400 Europeans, chiefly Maltese\r\nand Greeks, are settled in the island. Jerba has a considerable\r\nreputation for the manufacture of the woollen tissues interwoven with\r\nsilk which are known as burnous stuffs; a market for the sale of sponges\r\nis held from November till March; and there is a considerable export\r\ntrade in olives, dates, figs and other fruits. The capital, trading\r\ncentre and usual landing-place are at Haumt-es-Suk (market quarter) on\r\nthe north side of the island (pop. 2500). Here are a medieval fort,\r\nbuilt by the Spaniards in 1284, and a modern fort, garrisoned by the\r\nFrench. Gallala, to the south, is noted for the manufacture of a kind of\r\nwhite pottery, much prized. At El Kantara (the bridge) on the eastern\r\nstrait, and formerly connected with the mainland by a causeway, are\r\nextensive ruins of a Roman city--probably those of Meninx, once a\r\nflourishing seaport.\r\n\r\nJerba is the Lotophagitis or Lotus-eaters' Island of the Greek and Roman\r\ngeographers, and is also identified with the Brachion of Scylax. The\r\nmodern name appears as early as the 4th century in Sextus Aurelius\r\nVictor. In the middle ages the possession of Jerba was contested by the\r\nNormans of Sicily, the Spaniards and the Turks, the Turks proving\r\nvictorious. In 1560 after the destruction of the Spanish fleet off the\r\ncoast of the island by Piali Pasha and the corsair Dragut the Spanish\r\ngarrison at Haumt-es-Suk was exterminated, and a pyramid, 10 ft. broad\r\nat the base and 20 ft. high, was built of their skulls and other bones.\r\nIn 1848 this pyramid was pulled down at the instance of the Christian\r\ncommunity, and the bones were buried in the Catholic cemetery. In\r\ngeneral, from the Arab invasion in the 7th century Jerba shared the\r\nfortunes of Tunisia.\r\n\r\n  See H. Barth, _Wanderungen durch die Küstenl. des Mittelmeeres_\r\n  (Berlin, 1849); and H. von Maltzan, _Reise in Tunis und Tripolis_\r\n  (Leipzig, 1870).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJERBOA, properly the name of an Arabian and North African jumping rodent\r\nmammal, _Jaculus aegyptius_ (also known as _Jaculus_, or _Dipus_,\r\n_jaculus_) typifying the family _Jaculidae_ (or _Dipodidae_), but in a\r\nwider sense applied to most of the representatives of that family, which\r\nare widely distributed over the desert and semi-desert tracts of the Old\r\nWorld, although unknown in Africa south of the Sahara. In all the more\r\ntypical members of the family the three middle metatarsals of the long\r\nhind-legs are fused into a cannon-bone; and in the true jerboas of the\r\ngenus _Jaculus_ the two lateral toes, with their supporting metatarsals,\r\nare lost, although they are present in the alactagas (_Alactaga_), in\r\nwhich, however, as in certain allied genera, only the three middle toes\r\nare functional. As regards the true jerboas, there is a curious\r\nresemblance in the structure of their hind-legs to that obtaining among\r\nbirds. In both groups, for instance, the lower part of the hind-leg is\r\nformed by a long, slender cannon-bone, or metatarsus, terminating\r\ninferiorly in triple condyles for the three long and sharply clawed\r\ntoes, the resemblance being increased by the fact that in both cases the\r\nsmall bone of the leg (fibula) is fused with the large one (tibia). It\r\nmay also be noticed that in mammals and birds which hop on two legs,\r\nsuch as jerboas, kangaroos, thrushes and finches, the proportionate\r\nlength of the thigh-bone or femur to the tibia and foot (metatarsus and\r\ntoes) is constant, being 2 to 5; in animals, on the other hand, such as\r\nhares, horses and frogs, which use all four feet, the corresponding\r\nlengths are 4 to 7. The resemblance between the jerboa's and the bird's\r\nskeleton is owing to adaptation to a similar mode of existence. In the\r\nyoung jerboa the proportion of the femur to the rest of the leg is the\r\nsame as in ordinary running animals. Further, at an early stage of\r\ndevelopment the fibula is a complete and separate bone, while the three\r\nmetatarsals, which subsequently fuse together to form the cannon-bone,\r\nare likewise separate. In addition to their long hind and short fore\r\nlimbs, jerboas are mostly characterized by their silky coats--of a fawn\r\ncolour to harmonize with their desert surroundings--their large eyes,\r\nand long tails and ears. As is always the case with large-eared animals,\r\nthe tympanic bullae of the skull are of unusually large size; the size\r\nvarying in the different genera according to that of the ears. (For the\r\ncharacteristics of the family and of its more important generic\r\nrepresentatives, see RODENTIA.)\r\n\r\n  In the Egyptian jerboa the length of the body is 8 in., and that of\r\n  the tail, which is long, cylindrical and covered with short hair\r\n  terminated by a tuft, 10 in. The five-toed front limbs are extremely\r\n  short, while the hind pair are six times as long. When about to\r\n  spring, this jerboa raises its body by means of the hinder\r\n  extremities, and supports itself at the same time upon its tail, while\r\n  the fore-feet are so closely pressed to the breast as to be scarcely\r\n  visible, which doubtless suggested the name _Dipus_, or two-footed. It\r\n  then leaps into the air and alights upon its four feet, but\r\n  instantaneously erecting itself, it makes another spring, and so on in\r\n  such rapid succession as to appear as if rather flying than running.\r\n  It is a gregarious animal, living in considerable colonies in burrows,\r\n  which it excavates with its nails and teeth in the sandy soil of Egypt\r\n  and Arabia. In these it remains during great part of the day, emerging\r\n  at night in search of the herbs on which it feeds. It is exceedingly\r\n  shy, and this, together with its extraordinary agility, renders it\r\n  difficult to capture. The Arabs, however, succeed by closing up all\r\n  the exits from the burrows with a single exception, by which the\r\n  rodents are forced to escape, and over which a net is placed for their\r\n  capture. When confined, they will gnaw through the hardest wood in\r\n  order to make their escape. The Persian jerboa (_Alactaga indica_) is\r\n  also a nocturnal burrowing animal, feeding chiefly on grain, which it\r\n  stores up in underground repositories, closing these when full, and\r\n  only drawing upon them when the supply of food above ground is\r\n  exhausted (see also JUMPING MOUSE).     (R. L.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJERDAN, WILLIAM (1782-1869), Scottish journalist, was born on the 16th\r\nof April 1782, at Kelso, Scotland. During the years between 1799 and\r\n1806 he spent short periods in a country lawyer's office, a London West\r\nIndia merchant's counting-house, an Edinburgh solicitor's chambers, and\r\nheld the position of surgeon's mate on board H.M. guardship \"Gladiator\"\r\nin Portsmouth Harbour, under his uncle, who was surgeon. He went to\r\nLondon in 1806, and became a newspaper reporter. He was in the lobby of\r\nthe House of Commons on the 11th of May 1812 when Spencer Perceval was\r\nshot, and was the first to seize the assassin. By 1812 he had become\r\neditor of _The Sun_, a semi-official Tory paper; he occasionally\r\ninserted literary articles, then quite an unusual proceeding; but a\r\nquarrel with the chief proprietor brought that engagement to a close in\r\n1817. He passed next to the editor's chair of the _Literary Gazette_,\r\nwhich he conducted with success for thirty-four years. Jerdan's position\r\nas editor brought him into contact with many distinguished writers. An\r\naccount of his friends, among whom Canning was a special intimate, is to\r\nbe found in his _Men I have Known_ (1866). When Jerdan retired in 1850\r\nfrom the editorship of the _Literary Gazette_ his pecuniary affairs were\r\nfar from satisfactory. A testimonial of over £900 was subscribed by his\r\nfriends; and in 1853 a government pension of 100 guineas was conferred\r\non him by Lord Aberdeen. He published his _Autobiography_ in 1852-1853,\r\nand died on the 11th of July 1869.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEREMIAH, in the Bible, the last pre-exilic prophet (fl. 626-586 B.C.?),\r\nson of Hilkiah.\r\n\r\n_Early Days of Jeremiah._--There must anciently have existed one or more\r\nprose works on Jeremiah and his times, written partly to do honour to\r\nthe prophet, partly to propagate those views respecting Israel's past\r\nwith which the name of Jeremiah was associated. Some fragments of this\r\nwork (or these works) have come down to us; they greatly add to the\r\npopularity of the Book of Jeremiah. Strict historical truth we must not\r\nask of them, but they do give us what was believed concerning Jeremiah\r\nin the following age, and we must believe that the personality so\r\nhonoured was an extraordinary one. We have also a number of genuine\r\nprophecies which admit us into Jeremiah's inner nature. These are our\r\nbest authorities, but they are deficient in concrete facts. By birth\r\nJeremiah was a countryman; he came of a priestly family whose estate lay\r\nat Anathoth \"in the land of Benjamin\" (xxxii. 3; cf. i. 1). He came\r\nforward as a prophet in the thirteenth year of Josiah (626 B.C.), still\r\nyoung but irresistibly impelled. Unfortunately the account of the call\r\nand of the object of the divine caller come to us from a later hand (ch.\r\ni.), but we can well believe that the concrete fact which the prophetic\r\ncall illuminated was an impending blow to the state (i. 13-16; cf. ch.\r\niv.). What the blow exactly was is disputed,[1] but it is certain that\r\nJeremiah saw the gathering storm and anticipated its result, while the\r\nstatesmen were still wrapped in a false security. Five years later came\r\nthe reform movement produced by the \"finding\" of the \"book of the law\"\r\nin the Temple in 621 B.C. (2 Kings xxii. 8), and some critics have\r\ngathered from Jer. xi. 1-8 that Jeremiah joined the ranks of those who\r\npublicly supported this book in Jerusalem and elsewhere. To others this\r\nview appears in itself improbable. How can a man like Jeremiah have\r\nadvocated any such panacea? He was indeed not at first a complete\r\npessimist, but to be a preacher of Deuteronomy required a sanguine\r\ntemper which a prophet of the school of Isaiah could not possess.\r\nBesides, there is a famous passage (viii. 8, see R.V.) in which Jeremiah\r\ndelivers a vehement attack upon the \"scribes\" (or, as we might render,\r\n\"bookmen\") and their \"false pen.\" If, as Wellhausen and Duhm suppose,\r\nthis refers to Deuteronomy (i.e. the original Deuteronomy), the\r\nincorrectness of the theory referred to is proved. And even if we think\r\nthat the phraseology of viii. 8 applies rather to a body of writings\r\nthan to a single book, yet there is no good ground (xi. 1-8 and xxxiv.\r\n12 being of doubtful origin) for supposing that Jeremiah would have\r\nexcepted Deuteronomy from his condemnation.\r\n\r\n_Stages of his Development._--At first our prophet was not altogether a\r\npessimist. He aspired to convince the better minds that the only hope\r\nfor Israelites, as well as for Israel, lay in \"returning\" to the true\r\nYahweh, a deity who was no mere national god, and was not to be cajoled\r\nby the punctual offering of costly sacrifices. When Jeremiah wrote iv.\r\n1-4 he evidently considered that the judgment could even then be\r\naverted. Afterwards he became less hopeful, and it was perhaps a closer\r\nacquaintance with the manners of the capital that served to\r\ndisillusionize him. He began his work at Anathoth, but v. 1-5 (as Duhm\r\npoints out) seems to come from one who has just now for the first time\r\n\"run to and fro in the streets of Jerusalem,\" observing and observed.\r\nAnd what is the result of his expedition? That he cannot find a single\r\njust and honest man; that high and low, rich and poor, are all ignorant\r\nof the true method of worshipping God (\"the way of Yahweh,\" v. 4). It\r\nwould seem as if Anathoth were less corrupt than the capital, the moral\r\nstate of which so shocked Jeremiah. And yet he does not really go beyond\r\nthe great city-prophet Isaiah who calls the men of Jerusalem \"a people\r\nof Gomorrah\" (i. 10). With all reverence, an historical student has to\r\ndeduct something from both these statements. It is true that commercial\r\nprosperity had put a severe strain on the old morality, and that contact\r\nwith other peoples, as well as the course of political history, had\r\nappeared to lower the position of the God of Israel in relation to other\r\ngods. Still, some adherents of the old Israelitish moral and religious\r\nstandards must have survived, only they were not to be found in the\r\nchief places of concourse, but as a rule in coteries which handed on the\r\ntraditions of Amos and Isaiah in sorrowful retirement.\r\n\r\n_Danger of Book Religion._--Probably, too, even in the highest class\r\nthere were some who had a moral sympathy with Jeremiah; otherwise we can\r\nhardly account for the contents of Deuteronomy, at least if the book\r\n\"found\" in the Temple at all resembled the central portion of our\r\nDeuteronomy. And the assumption seems to be confirmed by the respectful\r\nattitude of certain \"elders of the land\" in xxvi. 17 sqq., and of the\r\n\"princes\" in xxxvi. 19, 25, towards Jeremiah, which may, at any rate in\r\npart, have been due to the recent reform movement. If therefore Jeremiah\r\naimed at Deuteronomy in the severe language of viii. 8, he went too far.\r\nHistory shows that book religion has special dangers of its own.[2]\r\nNevertheless the same incorruptible adviser also shows that book\r\nreligion may be necessary as an educational instrument, and a compromise\r\nbetween the two types of religion is without historical precedent.\r\n\r\n_Reaction: Opposition to Jeremiah._--This, however, could not as yet be\r\nrecognized by the friends of prophecy, even though it seemed for a time\r\nas if the claims of book religion were rebuffed by facts. The death of\r\nthe pious king Josiah at Megiddo in 608 B.C. dashed the high hopes of\r\nthe \"book-men,\" but meant no victory for Jeremiah. Its only result for\r\nthe majority was a falling back on the earlier popular cultus of the\r\nBaals, and on the heathen customs introduced, or reintroduced, by\r\nJosiah's grandfather, Manasseh. Would that we possessed the section of\r\nthe prophet's biography which described his attitude immediately after\r\nthe news of the battle of Megiddo! Let us, however, be thankful for what\r\nwe have, and notably for the detailed narratives in chs. xxvi. and\r\nxxxvi. The former is dated in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim,\r\nthough Wellhausen suspects that the date is a mistake, and that the real\r\noccasion was the death of Josiah. The one clear-sighted patriot saw the\r\nfull meaning of the tragedy of Megiddo, and for \"prophesying against\r\nthis city\"--secured, as men thought, by the Temple (vii. 4)--he was\r\naccused by \"the priests, the prophets, and all the people\" of high\r\ntreason. But the divinity which hedged a prophet saved him. The\r\n\"princes,\" supported by certain \"elders\" and by \"the people\" (quick to\r\nchange their leaders), succeeded in quashing the accusation and setting\r\nthe prophet free. No king, be it observed, is mentioned. The latter\r\nnarrative is still more exciting. In the fourth year of Jehoiakim (= the\r\nfirst of Nebuchadrezzar, xxv. 1) Jeremiah was bidden to write down \"all\r\nthe words that Yahweh had spoken to him against Jerusalem (so LXX.),\r\nJudah and all the nations from the days of Josiah onwards\" (xxxvi. 2).\r\nSo at least the authors of Jeremiah's biography tell us. They add that\r\nin the next year Jeremiah's scribe Baruch read the prophecies of\r\nJeremiah first to the people assembled in the Temple, then to the\r\n\"princes,\" and then to the king, who decided his own future policy by\r\nburning Baruch's roll in the brazier. We cannot, however, bind ourselves\r\nto this tradition. Much more probably the prophecy was virtually a new\r\none (i.e. even if some old passages were repeated yet the setting was\r\nnew), and the burden of the prophecy was \"The king of Babylon shall come\r\nand destroy this land.\"[3] We cannot therefore assent to the judgment\r\nthat \"we have, at least as regards [the] oldest portions [of the book]\r\ninformation considerably more specific than is usual in the case of the\r\nwritings of the prophets.\"[4]\r\n\r\n_Fall of the State._--Under Zedekiah the prophet was less fortunate.\r\nSuch was the tension of feeling that the \"princes,\" who were formerly\r\nfriendly to Jeremiah, now took up an attitude of decided hostility to\r\nhim. At last they had him consigned to a miry dungeon, and it was the\r\nking who (at the instance of the Cushite Ebed-melech) intervened for his\r\nrelief, though he remained a prisoner in other quarters till the fall of\r\nJerusalem (586 B.C.). Nebuchadrezzar, who is assumed to have heard of\r\nJeremiah's constant recommendations of submission, gave him the choice\r\neither of going to Babylon or of remaining in the country (chs. xxxviii.\r\nseq.). He chose the latter and resided with Gedaliah, the native\r\ngovernor, at Mizpah. On the murder of Gedaliah he was carried to Mizraim\r\nor Egypt, or perhaps to the land of Mizrim in north Arabia--against his\r\nwill (chs. xl.-xliii.). How far all this is correct we know not. The\r\ngraphic style of a narrative is no sufficient proof of its truth.\r\nConceivably enough the story of Jeremiah's journey to Egypt (or Mizrim)\r\nmay have been imagined to supply a background for the artificial\r\nprophecies ascribed to Jeremiah in chs. xlvi.-li. A legend in Jerome and\r\nEpiphanius states that he was stoned to death at Daphnae, but the\r\nbiography, though not averse from horrors, does not mention this.\r\n\r\n_A Patriot?_--Was Jeremiah really a patriot? The question has been\r\nvariously answered. He was not a Phocion, for he never became the tool\r\nof a foreign power. To say with Winckler[5] that he was \"a decided\r\nadherent of the Chaldean party\" is to go beyond the evidence. He did\r\nindeed counsel submission, but only because his detachment from party\r\ngave him a clearness of vision (cf. xxxviii. 17, 18) which the\r\npoliticians lacked. How he suffered in his uphill course he has told us\r\nhimself (xv. 10-21). In after ages the oppressed people saw in his love\r\nfor Israel and his patient resignation their own realized ideal. \"And\r\nOnias said, This is the lover of the brethren, he who prayeth much for\r\nthe people and the holy city, Jeremiah the prophet of God\" (2 Macc. xv.\r\n14). And in proportion as the popular belief in Jeremiah rose, fresh\r\nprophecies were added to the book (notably those of the new covenant and\r\nof the restoration of the people after seventy years) to justify it.\r\nProfessor N. Schmidt has gone further into the character of this\r\nsympathetic prophet, _Ency. Bib._ \"Jeremiah,\" § 5.\r\n\r\n  _Jeremiah's Prophecies._--It has been said above that our best\r\n  authorities are Jeremiah's own prophecies. Which may these be? Before\r\n  answering we must again point out (see also ISAIAH) that the records\r\n  of the pre-exilic prophets came down in a fragmentary form, and that\r\n  these fragments needed much supplementing to adapt them to the use of\r\n  post-exilic readers. In Jeremiah, as in Isaiah, we must constantly ask\r\n  to what age do the phraseology, the ideas and the implied\r\n  circumstances most naturally point? According to Duhm there are many\r\n  passages in which metre (see also AMOS) may also be a factor in our\r\n  critical conclusions. Jeremiah, he thinks, always uses the same metre.\r\n  Giesebrecht, on the other hand, maintains that there are passages\r\n  which are certainly Jeremiah's, but which are not in what Duhm calls\r\n  Jeremiah's metre; Giesebrecht also, himself rather conservative,\r\n  considers Duhm remarkably free with his emendations. There has also to\r\n  be considered whether the text of the poetical passages has not often\r\n  become corrupt, not only from ordinary causes but through the\r\n  misunderstanding and misreading of north Arabian names on the part of\r\n  late scribes and editors, the danger to Judah from north Arabia being\r\n  (it is held) not less in pre-exilic times than the danger from Assyria\r\n  and Babylonia, so that references to north Arabia are only to be\r\n  expected. To bring educated readers into touch with critical workers\r\n  it is needful to acquaint them with these various points, the neglect\r\n  of any one of which may to some extent injure the results of\r\n  criticism.\r\n\r\n  It is a new stage of criticism on which we have entered, so that no\r\n  single critic can be reckoned as _the_ authority on Jeremiah. But\r\n  since the results of the higher criticism depend on the soundness and\r\n  thoroughness of the criticism called \"lower,\" and since Duhm has the\r\n  advantage of being exceptionally free from that exaggerated respect\r\n  for the letters of the traditional text which has survived the\r\n  destruction of the old superstitious veneration for the vowel-points,\r\n  it may be best to give the student his \"higher critical\" results,\r\n  dated 1901. Let us premise, however, that the portions mentioned in\r\n  the 9th edition of the _Ency. Brit._ as having been \"entirely or in\r\n  part denied,\" to Jeremiah, viz. x. 1-16; xxx.; xxxiii.; l.-li. and\r\n  lii., are still regarded in their present form as non-Jeremianic. The\r\n  question which next awaits decision is whether any part of the booklet\r\n  on foreign nations (xxv., xlvi.-li.) can safely be regarded as\r\n  Jeremianic. Giesebrecht still asserts the genuineness of xxv. 15-24\r\n  (apart from glosses), xlvii. (in the main) and xlix. 7, 8, 10, 11.\r\n  Against these views see N. Schmidt, _Ency. Bib._, col. 2384.\r\n\r\n  Let us now listen to Duhm, who analyses the book into six groups of\r\n  passages.

Such, however, is not the case. It is true that \"there are\r\n  (in the LXX.) many omissions of words, sentences, verses and whole\r\n  passages, in fact, that altogether about 2700 words are wanting, or\r\n  the eighth part of the Massoretic text\" (Bleek). It may also be\r\n  admitted that the scribes who produced the Hebrew basis of the\r\n  Septuagint version, conscious of the unsettled state of the text, did\r\n  not shrink from what they considered a justifiable simplification. But\r\n  we must also grant that those from whom the \"written\" Hebrew text\r\n  proceeds allowed themselves to fill up and to repeat without any\r\n  sufficient warrant. In each case in which there is a genuine\r\n  difference of reading between the two texts, it is for the critic to\r\n  decide; often, however, he will have to seek to go behind what both\r\n  the texts present in order to constitute a truer text than either.\r\n  Here is the great difficulty of the future. We may add to the credit\r\n  of the Septuagint that the position given to the prophecies on \"the\r\n  nations\" (chs. xlvi.-li. in our Bible) in the Septuagint is probably\r\n  more original than that in the Massoretic text. On this point see\r\n  especially Schmidt, _Ency. Bib._ \"Jeremiah (Book)\" §§ 6 and 21;\r\n  Davidson, Hastings's _Dict. Bible_, ii. 573b-575; Driver,\r\n  _Introduction_ (8th ed.), pp. 269, 270.\r\n\r\n  The best German commentary is that of Cornill (1905). A skilful\r\n  translation by Driver, with notes intended for ordinary students\r\n  (1906) should also be mentioned.     (T. K. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] Davidson (Hast., _D.B._, ii. 570 b) mentions two views. (1) The\r\n    foe might be \"a creation of his moral presentiment and assigned to\r\n    the north as the cloudy region of mystery.\" (2) The more usual view\r\n    is that the Scythians (see Herod, i. 76, 103-106; iv. 1 ) are meant.\r\n    Neither of these views is satisfactory. The passage v. 15-17 is too\r\n    definite for (1), and as for (2), the idea of a threatened Scythian\r\n    invasion lacks a sufficient basis. Those who hold (2) have to suppose\r\n    that original references to the Scythians were retouched under the\r\n    impression of Chaldean invasions. Hence Cheyne's theory of a north\r\n    Arabian invasion from the land of Zaphon = Zibeon (Gen. xxxvi. 2,\r\n    14), i.e. Ishmael. Cf. N. Schmidt, _Ency. Bib._, Zibeon, \"Scythians,\"\r\n    § 8; Cheyne, _Critica Biblica_, part i. (Isaiah and Jeremiah).\r\n\r\n  [2] Cf. Ewald, _The Prophets_, Eng. trans., iii. 63, 64.\r\n\r\n  [3] Cheyne, _Ency. Brit._ (9th ed.,), \"Jeremiah,\" suggests after\r\n    Grätz that the roll simply contained ch. xxv., omitting the most\r\n    obvious interpolations. Against this view see N. Schmidt, _Ency.\r\n    Bib._, \"Jeremiah (Book),\" § 8, who, however, accepts the negative\r\n    part of Cheyne's arguments.\r\n\r\n  [4] Driver, _Introd. to the Lit. of the O.T._ (6), p. 249.\r\n\r\n  [5] In Helmolt's _Weltgeschichte_, iii. 211.\r\n\r\n  [6] li. 59-64a, however, is a specimen of imaginative \"Midrashic\"\r\n    history. See Giesebrecht's monograph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEREMY, EPISTLE OF, an apocryphal book of the Old Testament. This letter\r\npurports to have been written by Jeremiah to the exiles who were already\r\nin Babylon or on the way thither. The author was a Hellenistic Jew, and\r\nnot improbably a Jew of Alexandria. His work, which shows little\r\nliterary skill, was written with a serious practical purpose. He veiled\r\nhis fierce attack on the idol gods of Egypt by holding up to derision\r\nthe idolatry of Babylon. The fact that Jeremiah (xxix. 1 sqq.) was known\r\nto have written a letter of this nature naturally suggested to a\r\nHellenist, possibly of the 1st century B.C. or earlier, the idea of a\r\nsecond epistolary undertaking, and other passages of Jeremiah's prophecy\r\n(x. 1-12; xxix. 4-23) may have determined also its general character and\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\nThe writer warned the exiles that they were to remain in captivity for\r\nseven generations; that they would there see the worship paid to idols,\r\nfrom all participation in which they were to hold aloof; for that idols\r\nwere nothing save the work of men's hands, without the powers of speech,\r\nhearing or self-preservation. They could not bless their worshippers\r\neven in the smallest concerns of life; they were indifferent to moral\r\nqualities, and were of less value than the commonest household objects,\r\nand finally, \"with rare irony, the author compared an idol to a\r\nscarecrow (v. 70), impotent to protect, but deluding to the imagination\"\r\n(MARSHALL).\r\n\r\n  The date of the epistle is uncertain. It is believed by some scholars\r\n  to be referred to in 2 Macc. ii. 2, which says that Jeremiah charged\r\n  the exiles \"not to forget the statutes of the Lord, neither to be led\r\n  astray in their minds when they saw images of gold and silver and the\r\n  adornment thereof.\" But the reference is disputed by Fritzsche,\r\n  Gifford, Shürer and others. The epistle was included in the Greek\r\n  canon. There was no question of its canonicity till the time of\r\n  Jerome, who termed it a pseudepigraph.\r\n\r\n  See Fritzsche, _Handb. zu den Apok._, 1851; Gifford, in _Speaker's\r\n  Apoc._ ii. 286-303; Marshall, in Hastings' _Dict. Bible_, ii. 578-579.\r\n       (R. H. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJERÉZ DE LA FRONTERA (formerly XERES), a town of southern Spain, in the\r\nprovince of Cadiz, near the right bank of the river Guadalete, and on\r\nthe Seville-Cadiz railway, about 7 m. from the Atlantic coast. Pop.\r\n(1900), 63,473. Jeréz is built in the midst of an undulating plain of\r\ngreat fertility. Its whitewashed houses, clean, broad streets, and\r\nsquares planted with trees extend far beyond the limits formerly\r\nenclosed by the Moorish walls, almost entirely demolished. The principal\r\nbuildings are the 15th-century church of San Miguel, the 17th-century\r\ncollegiate church with its lofty bell-tower, the 16th-century town-hall,\r\nsuperseded, for official purposes, by a modern edifice, the bull-ring,\r\nand many hospitals, charitable institutions and schools, including\r\nacademies of law, medicine and commerce. But the most characteristic\r\nfeatures of Jeréz are the huge _bodegas_, or wine-lodges, for the\r\nmanufacture and storage of sherry, and the vineyards, covering more than\r\n150,000 acres, which surround it on all sides. The town is an important\r\nmarket for grain, fruit and livestock, but its staple trade is in wine.\r\nSherry is also produced in other districts, but takes its name, formerly\r\nwritten in English as _sherris_ or _xeres_, from Jeréz. The demand for\r\nsherry diminished very greatly during the last quarter of the 19th\r\ncentury, especially in England, which had been the chief consumer. In\r\n1872 the sherry shipped from Cadiz to Great Britain alone was valued at\r\n£2,500,000; in 1902 the total export hardly amounted to one-fifth of\r\nthis sum. The wine trade, however, still brings a considerable profit,\r\nand few towns of southern Spain display greater commercial activity than\r\nJeréz. In the earlier part of the 18th century the neighbourhood\r\nsuffered severely from yellow fever; but it was rendered comparatively\r\nhealthy when in 1869 an aqueduct was opened to supply pure water.\r\nStrikes and revolutionary disturbances have frequently retarded business\r\nin more recent years.\r\n\r\nJeréz has been variously identified with the Roman Municipium Seriense;\r\nwith Asido, perhaps the original of the Moorish Sherish; and with Hasta\r\nRegia, a name which may survive in the designation of La Mesa de Asta, a\r\nneighbouring hill. Jeréz was taken from the Moors by Ferdinand III. of\r\nCastile (1217-1252); but it was twice recaptured before Alphonso X.\r\nfinally occupied it in 1264. Towards the close of the 14th century it\r\nreceived the title _de la Frontera_, i.e. \"of the frontier,\" common to\r\nseveral towns on the Moorish border.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJERÉZ DE LOS CABALLEROS, a town of south-western Spain, in the province\r\nof Badajoz, picturesquely situated on two heights overlooking the river\r\nArdila, a tributary of the Guadiana, 12 m. E. of the Portuguese\r\nfrontier. Pop. (1900), 10,271. The old town is surrounded by a Moorish\r\nwall with six gates; the newer portion is well and regularly built, and\r\nplanted with numerous orange and other fruit trees. Owing to the lack of\r\nrailway communication Jeréz is of little commercial importance; its\r\nstaple trade is in agricultural produce, especially in ham and bacon\r\nfrom the large herds of swine which are reared in the surrounding oak\r\nforests. The town is said to have been founded by Alphonso IX. of Leon\r\nin 1229; in 1232 it was extended by his son St Ferdinand, who gave it to\r\nthe knights templar. Hence the name _Jeréz de los Caballeros_, \"Jeréz of\r\nthe knights.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJERICHO ([Hebrew: Yricho, Yricho], once [Hebrew: Yrichoa], a word of\r\ndisputed meaning, whether \"fragrant\" or \"moon [-god] city\"), an\r\nimportant town in the Jordan valley some 5 m. N. of the Dead Sea. The\r\nreferences to it in the Pentateuch are confined to rough geographical\r\nindications of the latitude of the trans-Jordanic camp of the Israelites\r\nin Moab before their crossing of the river. This was the first Canaanite\r\ncity to be attacked and reduced by the victorious Israelites. The story\r\nof its conquest is His Sundays were spent in the catacombs in\r\ndiscovering graves of the martyrs and deciphering inscriptions. Pope\r\nLiberius baptized him in 360; three years later the news of the death of\r\nthe emperor Julian came to Rome, and Christians felt relieved from a\r\ngreat dread.\r\n\r\nWhen his student days were over Jerome returned to Strido, but did not\r\nstay there long. His character was formed. He was a scholar, with a\r\nscholar's tastes and cravings for knowledge, easily excited, bent on\r\nscholarly discoveries. From Strido he went to Aquileia, where he formed\r\nsome friendships among the monks of the large monastery, notably with\r\nRufinus, with whom he was destined to quarrel bitterly over the question\r\nof Origen's orthodoxy and worth as a commentator; for Jerome was a man\r\nwho always sacrificed a friend to an opinion, and when he changed sides\r\nin a controversy expected his acquaintances to follow him. From Aquileia\r\nhe went to Gaul (366-370), visiting in turn the principal places in that\r\ncountry, from Narbonne and Toulouse in the south to Treves on the\r\nnorth-east frontier. He stayed some time at Treves studying and\r\nobserving, and it was there that he first began to think seriously upon\r\nsacred things. From Treves he returned to Strido, and from Strido to\r\nAquileia. He settled down to literary work in Aquileia (370-373) and\r\ncomposed there his first original tract, _De muliere septies percussa_,\r\nin the form of a letter to his friend Innocentius. Some dispute caused\r\nhim to leave Aquileia suddenly; and with a few companions, Innocentius,\r\nEvagrius, and Heliodorus being among them, he started for a long tour in\r\nthe East. The epistle to Rufinus (3rd in Vallarsi's enumeration) tells\r\nus the route. They went through Thrace, visiting Athens, Bithynia,\r\nGalatia, Pontus, Cappadocia and Cilicia, to Antioch, Jerome observing\r\nand making notes as they went. He was interested in the theological\r\ndisputes and schisms in Galatia, in the two languages spoken in Cilicia,\r\n&c. At Antioch the party remained some time. Innocentius died of a\r\nfever, and Jerome was dangerously ill. This illness induced a spiritual\r\nchange, and he resolved to renounce whatever kept him back from God. His\r\ngreatest temptation was the study of the literature of pagan Rome. In a\r\ndream Christ reproached him with caring more to be a Ciceronian than a\r\nChristian. He disliked the uncouth style of the Scriptures. \"O Lord,\" he\r\nprayed, \"thou knowest that whenever I have and study secular MSS. I deny\r\nthee,\" and he made a resolve henceforth to devote his scholarship to the\r\nHoly Scripture. \"David was to be henceforth his Simonides, Pindar and\r\nAlcaeus, his Flaccus, Catullus and Severus.\" Fortified by these resolves\r\nhe betook himself to a hermit life in the wastes of Chalcis, S.E. from\r\nAntioch (373-379). Chalcis was the Thebaid of Syria. Great numbers of\r\nmonks, each in solitary cell, spent lonely lives, scorched by the sun,\r\nill-clad and scantily fed, pondering on portions of Scripture or copying\r\nMSS. to serve as objects of meditation. Jerome at once set himself to\r\nsuch scholarly work as the place afforded. He discovered and copied\r\nMSS., and began to study Hebrew. There also he wrote the life of St Paul\r\nof Thebes, probably an imaginary tale embodying the facts of the monkish\r\nlife around him. Just then the Meletian schism, which arose over the\r\nrelation of the orthodox to Arian bishops and to those baptized by\r\nArians, distressed the church at Antioch (see MELETIUS OF ANTIOCH), and\r\nJerome as usual eagerly joined the fray. Here as elsewhere he had but\r\none rule to guide him in matters of doctrine and discipline--the\r\npractice of Rome and the West; for it is singular to see how Jerome, who\r\nis daringly original in points of scholarly criticism, was a ruthless\r\npartisan in all other matters; and, having discovered what was the\r\nWestern practice, he set tongue and pen to work with his usual\r\nbitterness (_Altercatio luciferiani et orthodoxi_).\r\n\r\nAt Antioch in 379 he was ordained presbyter. From there he went to\r\nConstantinople, where he met with the great Eastern scholar and\r\ntheologian Gregory of Nazianzus, and with his aid tried to perfect\r\nhimself in Greek. The result of his studies there was the translation of\r\nthe _Chronicon_ of Eusebius, with a continuation[1] of twenty-eight\r\nhomilies of Origen on Jeremiah and Ezekiel, and of nine homilies of\r\nOrigen on the visions of Isaiah.\r\n\r\nIn 381 Meletius died, and Pope Damasus interfered in the dispute at\r\nAntioch, hoping to end it. Jerome was called to Rome in 382 to give help\r\nin the matter, and was made secretary during the investigation. His work\r\nbrought him into intercourse with this great pontiff, who soon saw what\r\nhe could best do, and how his vast scholarship might be made of use to\r\nthe church. Damasus suggested to him to revise the \"Old Latin\"\r\ntranslation of the Bible; and to this task he henceforth devoted his\r\ngreat abilities. At Rome were published the Gospels (with a dedication\r\nto Pope Damasus, an explanatory introduction, and the canons of\r\nEusebius), the rest of the New Testament and the version of the Psalms\r\nfrom the Septuagint known as the _Psalterium romanum_, which was\r\nfollowed (c. 388) by the _Psalterium gallicanum_, based on the Hexaplar\r\nGreek text. These scholarly labours, however, did not take up his whole\r\ntime, and it was almost impossible for Jerome to be long anywhere\r\nwithout getting into a dispute. He was a zealous defender of that\r\nmonastic life which was beginning to take such a large place in the\r\nchurch of the 4th century, and he found enthusiastic disciples among the\r\nRoman ladies. A number of widows and maidens met together in the house\r\nof Marcella to study the Scriptures with him; he taught them Hebrew, and\r\npreached the virtues of the celibate life. His arguments and\r\nexhortations may be gathered from many of his epistles and from his\r\ntract _Adversus Helvidium_, in which he defends the perpetual virginity\r\nof Mary against Helvidius, who maintained that she bore children to\r\nJoseph. His influence over these ladies alarmed their relatives and\r\nexcited the suspicions of the regular priesthood and of the populace,\r\nbut while Pope Damasus lived Jerome remained secure. Damasus died,\r\nhowever, in 384, and was succeeded by Siricius, who did not show much\r\nfriendship for Jerome. He found it expedient to leave Rome, and set out\r\nfor the East in 385. His letters (especially Ep. 45) are full of\r\noutcries against his enemies and of indignant protestations that he had\r\ndone nothing unbecoming a Christian, that he had taken no money, nor\r\ngifts great nor small, that he had no delight in silken attire,\r\nsparkling gems or gold ornaments, that no matron moved him unless by\r\npenitence and fasting, &c. His route is given in the third book _In\r\nRufinum_; he went by Rhegium and Cyprus, where he was entertained by\r\nBishop Epiphanius, to Antioch. There he was joined by two wealthy Roman\r\nladies, Paula, a widow, and Eustochium, her daughter, one of Jerome's\r\nHebrew students. They came accompanied by a band of Roman maidens vowed\r\nto live a celibate life in a nunnery in Palestine. Accompanied by these\r\nladies Jerome made the tour of Palestine, carefully noting with a\r\nscholar's keenness the various places mentioned in Holy Scripture. The\r\nresults of this journey may be traced in his translation with\r\nemendations of the book of Eusebius on the situation and names of Hebrew\r\nplaces, written probably three years afterwards, when he had settled\r\ndown at Bethlehem. From Palestine Jerome and his companions went to\r\nEgypt, remaining some time in Alexandria, and they visited the convents\r\nof the Nitrian desert. Jerome's mind was evidently full of anxiety about\r\nhis translation of the Old Testament, for we find him in his letters\r\nrecording the conversations he had with learned men about disputed\r\nreadings and doubtful renderings; the blind Didymus of Alexandria, whom\r\nhe heard interpreting Hosea, appears to have been most useful. When they\r\nreturned to Palestine they all settled at Bethlehem, where Paula built\r\nfour monasteries, three for nuns and one for monks. She was at the head\r\nof the nunneries until her death in 404, when Eustochium succeeded her;\r\nJerome presided over the fourth monastery. Here he did most of his\r\nliterary work and, throwing aside his unfinished plan of a translation\r\nfrom Origen's Hexaplar text, translated the Old Testament directly from\r\nthe Hebrew, with the aid of Jewish scholars. He mentions a rabbi from\r\nLydda, a rabbi from Tiberias, and above all rabbi Ben Anina, who came to\r\nhim by night secretly for fear of the Jews. Jerome was not familiar\r\nenough with Hebrew to be able to dispense with such assistance, and he\r\nmakes the synagogue responsible for the fully narrated in the first\r\nseven chapters of Joshua. There must be some little exaggeration in the\r\nstatement that Jericho was totally destroyed; a hamlet large enough to\r\nbe enumerated among the towns of Benjamin (Josh. xviii. 21) must have\r\nremained; but that it was small is shown by the fact that it was deemed\r\na suitable place for David's ambassadors to retire to after the\r\nindignities put upon them by Hanun (2 Sam. x. 5; 1 Chron. xix. 5). Its\r\nrefortification was due to a Bethelite named Hiel, who endeavoured to\r\navert the curse of Joshua by offering his sons as sacrifices at certain\r\nstages of the work (1 Kings xvi. 34). After this event it grew again\r\ninto importance and became the site of a college of prophets (2 Kings\r\nii. 4 sqq.) for whom Elisha \"healed\" its poisonous waters. The principal\r\nspring in the neighbourhood of Jericho still bears (among the foreign\r\nresidents) the name of Elisha; the natives call it, Ain es-Sultan, or\r\n\"Sultan's spring.\" To Jericho the victorious Israelite marauders\r\nmagnanimously returned their Judahite captives at the bidding of the\r\nprophet Oded (2 Chron. xxviii. 15). Here was fought the last fight\r\nbetween the Babylonians and Zedekiah, wherein the kingdom of Judah came\r\nto an end (2 Kings xxv. 5; Jer. xxxix. 5, lii. 8). In the New Testament\r\nJericho is connected with the well-known stories of Bar-Timaeus (Matt.\r\nxx. 29; Mark x. 46; Luke xviii. 35) and Zacchaeus (Luke xix. 1) and with\r\nthe good Samaritan (Luke x. 30).\r\n\r\n  The extra-Biblical history of Jericho is as disastrous as are the\r\n  records preserved in the Scriptures. Bacchides, the general of the\r\n  Syrians, captured and fortified it (1. Macc. ix. 50), Aristobulus\r\n  (Jos. _Ant._ XIV. i. 2) also took it, Pompey (ib. XIV. iv. 1) encamped\r\n  here on his way to Jerusalem. Before Herod its inhabitants ran away\r\n  (ib. XIV. xv. 3) as they did before Vespasian (_Wars_, IV. viii. 2).\r\n  The reason of this lack of warlike quality was no doubt the enervating\r\n  effect of the great heat of the depression in which the city lies,\r\n  which has the same effect on the handful of degraded humanity that\r\n  still occupies the ancient site.\r\n\r\n  Few places in Palestine are more fertile. It was the city of palm\r\n  trees of the ancient record of the Israelite invasion preserved in\r\n  part in Judg. i. 16; and Josephus speaks of its fruitfulness with\r\n  enthusiasm (_Wars_ IV. 8, 3). Even now with every possible hindrance\r\n  in the way of cultivation it is an important centre of fruit-growing.\r\n\r\n  The modern er-Riha is a poor squalid village of, it is estimated,\r\n  about 300 inhabitants. It is not built exactly on the ancient site.\r\n  Indeed, the site of Jericho has shifted several times. The mound of\r\n  Tell es-Sultan, near \"Elisha's Fountain,\" north of the modern village,\r\n  no doubt covers the Canaanite town. There are two later sites, of\r\n  Roman or Herodian date, one north, the other west, of this. It was\r\n  probably the crusaders who established the modern site. An old tower\r\n  attributed to them is to be seen in the village, and in the\r\n  surrounding mountains are many remains of early monasticism.\r\n  Aqueducts, ruined sugar-mills, and other remains of ancient industry\r\n  abound in the neighbourhood. The whole district is the private\r\n  property of the sultan of Turkey. In 1907-8 the Canaanite Jericho was\r\n  excavated under the direction of Prof. Sellin of Vienna.\r\n\r\n  See \"The German Excavations at Jericho,\" _Pal. Explor. Fund, Quart.\r\n  Statem._ (1910), pp. 54-68.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] Cf.

The origin of the word is unknown. The Dutch word _jurk_, a\r\nchild's frock, often taken as the source, is modern, and represents\r\nneither the sound nor the sense of the English word. In architecture the\r\nterm \"jerkin-roofed\" is applied, probably with some obscure connexion\r\nwith the garment, to a particular form of gable end, the gable being cut\r\noff half way up the roof and sloping back like a \"hipped roof\" to the\r\nedge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEROBOAM (Heb. _yarob'am_, apparently \"Am ['the clan,' here perhaps a\r\ndivine name] contends\"; LXX.

The first king of (north) Israel after the disruption (see SOLOMON).\r\nAccording to the traditions of his early life (1 Kings xi. 26 sqq. and\r\nLXX.), he was an Ephraimite who for his ability was placed over the\r\nforced levy of Ephraim and Manasseh. Having subsequently incurred\r\nSolomon's suspicions he fled to Shishak, king of Egypt, and remained\r\nwith him until Rehoboam's accession. When the latter came to be made\r\nking at Shechem, the old religious centre (see ABIMELECH), hopes were\r\nentertained that a more lenient policy would be introduced. But\r\nRehoboam refused to depart from Solomon's despotic rule, and was\r\ntactless enough to send Adoniram, the overseer of the _corvée_. He was\r\nstoned to death, and Rehoboam realizing the temper of the people fled to\r\nJerusalem and prepared for war. Jeroboam became the recognized leader of\r\nthe northern tribes.[1] Conflicts occurred (1 Kings xiv. 30), but no\r\ndetails are preserved except the late story of Rehoboam's son Abijah in\r\n2 Chron. xiii. Jeroboam's chief achievement was the fortification of\r\nShechem (his new capital) and of Penuel in east Jordan. To counteract\r\nthe influence of Jerusalem he established golden calves at Dan and\r\nBethel, an act which to later ages was as gross a piece of wickedness as\r\nhis rebellion against the legitimate dynasty of Judah. No notice has\r\nsurvived of Shishak's invasion of Israel (see REHOBOAM), and after a\r\nreign of twenty-two years Jeroboam was succeeded by Nadab, whose violent\r\ndeath two years later brought the whole house of Jeroboam to an end.\r\n\r\n  The history of the separation of Judah and Israel in the 10th century\r\n  B.C. was written from a strong religious standpoint at a date\r\n  considerably later than the event itself. The visit of Ahijah to\r\n  Shiloh (xi. 29-39), to announce symbolically the rending of the\r\n  kingdom, replaces some account of a rebellion in which Jeroboam\r\n  \"lifted up his hand\" (v. 27) against Solomon. To such an account, not\r\n  to the incident of Ahijah and the cloak, his flight (v. 40) is the\r\n  natural sequel. The story of Ahijah's prophecy against Jeroboam (ch.\r\n  xiv.) is not in the original LXX., but another version of the same\r\n  narrative appears at xii. 24 (LXX.), in which there is no reference to\r\n  a previous promise to Jeroboam through Ahijah, but the prophet is\r\n  introduced as a new character. Further, in this version (xii. 24) the\r\n  incident of the tearing of the cloak is related of Shemaiah and placed\r\n  at the convention of Shechem. Shemaiah is the prophet who counselled\r\n  Rehoboam to refrain from war (xii. 21-24); the injunction is opposed\r\n  to xiv. 30, but appears to be intended to explain Rehoboam's failure\r\n  to overcome north Israel.

JEROBOAM, son of Joash (2) a contemporary of Azariah king of Judah.\r\nHe was one of the greatest of the kings of Israel. He succeeded in\r\nbreaking the power of Damascus, which had long been devastating his\r\nland, and extended his kingdom from Hamath on the Orontes to the Dead\r\nSea. The brief summary of his achievements preserved in 2 Kings xiv. 23\r\nsqq. may be supplemented by the original writings of Amos and Hosea.[2]\r\nThere appears to be an allusion in Amos vi. 13 to the recovery of\r\nAshteroth-Karnaim and Lodebar in E. Jordan, and the conquest of Moab\r\n(Isa. xv. seq.) is often ascribed to this reign. After a period of\r\nprosperity, internal disturbances broke out and the northern kingdom\r\nhastened to its fall. Jeroboam was succeeded by his son Zechariah, who\r\nafter six months was killed at Ibleam (so read in 2 Kings xv. 10; cp.\r\nix. 27, murder of Ahaziah) by Shallum the son of Jabesh--i.e. possibly\r\nof Jabesh-Gilead--who a month later fell to Menahem (q.v.).\r\n     (S.

In 2 Kings xiv. 28, \"Hamath, _which had belonged_\r\n    to Judah\" (R.V.) is incorrect; Winckler (_Keilinschrift. u. Alte\r\n    Test._, 2nd ed., 262) suspects a reference to Israel's overlordship\r\n    in Judah; Burney (_Heb.

What is\r\nknown of Jerome has mostly been recovered from his own writings. He\r\nappears to have been born about 340; his parents were Christians,\r\northodox though living among people mostly Arians and wealthy. He was at\r\nfirst educated at home, Bonosus, a life-long friend, sharing his\r\nyouthful studies, and was afterwards sent to Rome. Donatus taught him\r\ngrammar and explained the Latin poets. Victorinus taught him rhetoric.\r\nHe attended the law-courts, and listened to the Roman advocates pleading\r\nin the Forum. He went to the schools of philosophy, and heard lectures\r\non Plato, Diogenes, Clitomachus and Carneades; the conjunction of names\r\nshow how philosophy had become a dead tradition. accuracy of his\r\nversion: \"Let him who would challenge aught in this translation,\" he\r\nsays, \"ask the Jews.\" The result of all this labour was the Latin\r\ntranslation of the Scriptures which, in spite of much opposition from\r\nthe more conservative party in the church, afterwards became the Vulgate\r\nor authorized version; but the Vulgate as we have it now is not exactly\r\nJerome's Vulgate, for it suffered a good deal from changes made under\r\nthe influence of the older translations; the text became very corrupt\r\nduring the middle ages, and in particular all the Apocrypha, except\r\nTobit and Judith, which Jerome translated from the Chaldee, were added\r\nfrom the older versions. (See BIBLE: _O.T. Versions_.)\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the labour involved in translating the Scriptures,\r\nJerome found time to do a great deal of literary work, and also to\r\nindulge in violent controversy. Earlier in life he had a great\r\nadmiration for Origen, and translated many of his works, and this lasted\r\nafter he had settled at Bethlehem, for in 389 he translated Origen's\r\nhomilies on Luke; but he came to change his opinion and wrote violently\r\nagainst two admirers of the great Alexandrian scholar, John, bishop of\r\nJerusalem, and his own former friend Rufinus.\r\n\r\nAt Bethlehem also he found time to finish _Didymi de spiritu sancto\r\nliber_, a translation begun at Rome at the request of Pope Damasus, to\r\ndenounce the revival of Gnostic heresies by Jovinianus and Vigilantius\r\n(_Adv. Jovinianum lib. II._ and _Contra Vigilantium liber_), and to\r\nrepeat his admiration of the hermit life in his _Vita S. Hilarionis\r\neremitae_, in his _Vita Malchi monachi captivi_, in his translations of\r\nthe Rule of St Pachomius (the Benedict of Egypt), and in his _S.\r\nPachomii et S. Theodorici epistolae et verba mystica_. He also wrote at\r\nBethlehem _De viris illustribus sive de scriptoribus ecclesiasticis_, a\r\nchurch history in biographies, ending with the life of the author; _De\r\nnominibus Hebraicis_, compiled from Philo and Origen; and _De situ et\r\nnominibus locorum Hebraicorum_.[1] At the same place, too, he wrote\r\n_Quaestiones Hebraicae_ on Genesis,[2] and a series of commentaries on\r\nIsaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, the Twelve Minor Prophets, Matthew\r\nand the Epistles of St Paul. About 394 Jerome came to know Augustine,\r\nfor whom he held a high regard. He engaged in the Pelagian controversy\r\nwith more than even his usual bitterness (_Dialogi contra pelagianos_);\r\nand it is said that the violence of his invective so provoked his\r\nopponents that an armed mob attacked the monastery, and that Jerome was\r\nforced to flee and to remain in concealment for nearly two years. He\r\nreturned to Bethlehem in 418, and after a lingering illness died on the\r\n30th of September 420.\r\n\r\nJerome \"is one of the few Fathers to whom the title of Saint appears to\r\nhave been given in recognition of services rendered to the Church rather\r\nthan for eminent sanctity. He is the great Christian scholar of his age,\r\nrather than the profound theologian or the wise guide of souls.\" His\r\ngreat work was the Vulgate, but his achievements in other fields would\r\nhave sufficed to distinguish him. His commentaries are valuable because\r\nof his knowledge of Greek and Hebrew, his varied interests, and his\r\ncomparative freedom from allegory. To him we owe the distinction between\r\ncanonical and apocryphal writings; in the _Prologus Galeatus_ prefixed\r\nto his version of Samuel and Kings, he says that the church reads the\r\nApocrypha \"for the edification of the people, not for confirming the\r\nauthority of ecclesiastical doctrines.\" He was a pioneer in the fields\r\nof patrology and of biblical archaeology. In controversy he was too fond\r\nof mingling personal abuse with legitimate argument, and this weakness\r\nmars his letters, which were held in high admiration in the early middle\r\nages, and are valuable for their history of the man and his times.\r\nLuther in his _Table Talk_ condemns them as dealing only with fasting,\r\nmeats, virginity, &c. \"If he only had insisted upon the works of faith\r\nand performed them! But he teaches nothing either about faith, or love,\r\nor hope, or the works of faith.\"\r\n\r\n  Editions of the complete works: Erasmus (9 vols., Basel, 1516-1520);\r\n  Mar.

He was educated at the philological school, Marylebone,\r\nLondon; and was by turns clerk, schoolmaster and actor, before he\r\nsettled down to journalism. He made his reputation as a humorist in 1889\r\nwith _Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow_ and _Three Men in a Boat_, and\r\nfrom 1892 to 1897 he was co-editor of the _Idler_ with Robert Barr. At\r\nthe same time he was also the editor of _To-Day_. A one-act play of his,\r\n_Barbara_, was produced at the Globe theatre in 1886, and was followed\r\nby many others, among them _Sunset_ (1888), _Wood Barrow Farm_ (1891),\r\n_The Passing of the Third Floor Back_ (1907).

Jerome's part in the Hussite movement was formerly much\r\nover-rated. Very little is known of his early years. He is stated to\r\nhave belonged to a noble Bohemian family[1] and to have been a few years\r\nyounger than Hus. After beginning his studies at the university of\r\nPrague, where he never attempted to obtain any ecclesiastical office,\r\nJerome proceeded to Oxford in 1398. There he became greatly impressed by\r\nthe writings of Wycliffe, of whose _Dialogus_ and _Trialogus_ he made\r\ncopies. Always inclined to a roving life, he soon proceeded to the\r\nuniversity of Paris and afterwards continued his studies at Cologne and\r\nHeidelberg, returning to Prague in 1407. In 1403 he is stated to have\r\nundertaken a journey to Jerusalem. At Paris his open advocacy of the\r\nviews of Wycliffe brought him into conflict with John Gerson, chancellor\r\nof the university. In Prague Jerome soon attracted attention by his\r\nadvanced and outspoken opinions. He gave great offence also by\r\nexhibiting a portrait of Wycliffe in his room. Jerome was soon on terms\r\nof friendship with Hus, and took part in all the controversies of the\r\nuniversity. When in 1408 a French embassy arrived at Kutná Hora, the\r\nresidence of King Wenceslaus of Bohemia, and proposed that the papal\r\nschism should be terminated by the refusal of the temporal authorities\r\nfurther to recognize either of the rival popes, Wenceslaus summoned to\r\nKutná Hora the members of the university. The Bohemian _magistri_ spoke\r\nstrongly in favour of the French proposals, while the Germans maintained\r\ntheir allegiance to the Roman pope, Gregory XII. The reorganization of\r\nthe university was also discussed, and as Wenceslaus for a time favoured\r\nthe Germans, Hus and Jerome, as leaders of the Bohemians, incurred the\r\nanger of the king, who threatened them with death by fire should they\r\noppose his will.\r\n\r\nIn 1410 Jerome, who had incurred the hostility of the archbishop of\r\nPrague by his speeches in favour of Wycliffe's teaching, went to Ofen,\r\nwhere King Sigismund of Hungary resided, and, though a layman, preached\r\nbefore the king denouncing strongly the rapacity and immorality of the\r\nclergy. Sigismund shortly afterwards received a letter from the\r\narchbishop of Prague containing accusations against Jerome. He was\r\nimprisoned by order of the king, but does not appear to have been\r\ndetained long in Hungary. Appearing at Vienna, he was again brought\r\nbefore the ecclesiastical authorities. He was accused of spreading\r\nWycliffe's doctrines, and his general conduct at Oxford, Paris, Cologne,\r\nPrague and Ofen was censured. Jerome vowed that he would not leave\r\nVienna till he had cleared himself from the accusation of heresy.\r\nShortly afterwards he secretly left Vienna, declaring that this promise\r\nhad been forced on him. He went first to Vöttau in Moravia, and then to\r\nPrague. In 1412 the representatives of Pope Gregory XII. publicly\r\noffered indulgences for sale at Prague, wishing to raise money for the\r\npope's campaign against King Ladislaus of Naples, an adherent of the\r\nantipope of Avignon. Contrary to the wishes of the archbishop of Prague\r\na meeting of the members of the university took place, at which both Hus\r\nand Jerome spoke strongly against the sale of indulgences. The fiery\r\neloquence of Jerome, which is noted by all contemporary writers,\r\nobtained for him greater success even than that of Hus, particularly\r\namong the younger students, who conducted him in triumph to his\r\ndwelling-place. Shortly afterwards Jerome proceeded to Poland--it is\r\nsaid on the invitation of King Wladislaus. His courtly manners and his\r\neloquence here also caused him to become very popular, but he again met\r\nwith strong opposition from the Roman Church. While travelling with the\r\ngrand-duke Lithold of Lithuania Jerome took part in the religious\r\nservices of the Greek Orthodox Church.\r\n\r\nDuring his stay in northern Europe Jerome received the news that Hus had\r\nbeen summoned to appear before the council of Constance. He wrote to his\r\nfriend advising him to do so and adding that he would also proceed there\r\nto afford him assistance. Contrary to the advice of Hus he arrived at\r\nConstance on the 4th of April 1415. Advised to fly immediately to\r\nBohemia, he succeeded in reaching Hirschau, only 25 m. from the Bohemian\r\nfrontier. He was here arrested and brought back in chains to Constance,\r\nwhere he was examined by judges appointed by the council. His courage\r\nfailed him in prison and, to regain his freedom, he renounced the\r\ndoctrines of Wycliffe and Hus. He declared that Hus had been justly\r\nexecuted and stated in a letter addressed on the 12th of August 1415 to\r\nLacek, lord of Kravâr--the only literary document of Jerome that has\r\nbeen preserved--that \"the dead man (Hus) had written many false and\r\nharmful things.\" Full confidence was not placed in Jerome's recantation.\r\nHe claimed to be heard at a general meeting of the council, and this was\r\ngranted to him. He now again maintained all the theories which he had\r\nformerly advocated, and, after a trial that lasted only one day, he was\r\ncondemned to be burnt as a heretic. The sentence was immediately carried\r\nout on the 30th of May 1416, and he met his death with fortitude. As\r\nPoggio Bracciolini writes, \"none of the Stoics with so constant and\r\nbrave a soul endured death, which he (Jerome) seemed rather to long\r\nfor.\" The eloquence of the Italian humanist has bestowed a not entirely\r\nmerited aureole on the memory of Jerome of Prague.\r\n\r\n  See all works dealing with Hus; and indeed all histories of Bohemia\r\n  contain detailed accounts of the career of Jerome. _The Lives of John\r\n  Wicliffe, Lord Cobham, John Huss, Jerome of Prague and Zizka_ by\r\n  William Gilpin (London, 1765) still has a certain value.     (L.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] The statement that Jerome's family name was Faulfiss, is founded\r\n    on a misunderstood passage of Aeneas Sylvius, _Historica Bohemica_.\r\n    Aeneas Sylvius names as one of the early Bohemian reformers a man\r\n    \"_genere nobilis, ex domo quam Putridi Piscis vacant_.\" This was\r\n    erroneously believed to refer to Jerome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJERROLD, DOUGLAS WILLIAM (1803-1857), English dramatist and man of\r\nletters, was born in London on the 3rd of January 1803. His father,\r\nSamuel Jerrold, actor, was at that time lessee of the little theatre of\r\nWilsby near Cranbrook in Kent, but in 1807 he removed to Sheerness.\r\nThere, among the bluejackets who swarmed in the port during the war with\r\nFrance, Douglas grew into boyhood. He occasionally took a child's part\r\non the stage, but his father's profession had little attraction for the\r\nboy. In December 1813 he joined the guardship \"Namur,\" where he had Jane\r\nAusten's brother as captain, and he served as a midshipman until the\r\npeace of 1815. He saw nothing of the war save a number of wounded\r\nsoldiers from Waterloo; but till his dying day there lingered traces of\r\nhis early passion for the sea. The peace of 1815 ruined Samuel Jerrold;\r\nthere was no more prize money. On the 1st of January 1816 he removed\r\nwith his family to London, where the ex-midshipman began the world again\r\nas a printer's apprentice, and in 1819 became a compositor in the\r\nprinting-office of the _Sunday Monitor_. Several short papers and copies\r\nof verses by him had already appeared in the sixpenny magazines, and\r\none evening he dropped into the editor's box a criticism of the opera\r\n_Der Freischütz_. Next morning he received his own copy to set up,\r\ntogether with a flattering note from the editor, requesting further\r\ncontributions from the anonymous author. Thenceforward Jerrold was\r\nengaged in journalism. In 1821 a comedy that he had composed in his\r\nfifteenth year was brought out at Sadler's Wells theatre, under the\r\ntitle _More Frightened than Hurt_. Other pieces followed, and in 1825 he\r\nwas engaged for a few pounds weekly to produce dramas and farces to the\r\norder of Davidge of the Coburg theatre. In the autumn of 1824 the\r\n\"little Shakespeare in a camlet cloak,\" as he was called, married Mary\r\nSwann; and, while he was engaged with the drama at night, he was\r\nsteadily pushing his way as a journalist. For a short while he was part\r\nproprietor of a small Sunday newspaper. In 1829, through a quarrel with\r\nthe exacting Davidge, Jerrold left the Coburg; and his three-act\r\nmelodrama, _Black-eyed Susan; or, All in the Downs_, was brought out by\r\nR. W. Elliston at the Surrey theatre. The success of the piece was\r\nenormous. With its free gallant sea-flavour, it took the town by storm,\r\nand \"all London went over the water to see it.\" Elliston made a fortune\r\nby the piece; T. P. Cooke, who played William, made his reputation;\r\nJerrold received about £60 and was engaged as dramatic author at five\r\npounds a week. But his fame as a dramatist was achieved. In 1830 it was\r\nproposed that he should adapt something from the French for Drury Lane.\r\n\"No,\" was his reply, \"I shall come into this theatre as an original\r\ndramatist or not at all.\" _The Bride of Ludgate_ (December 8, 1831) was\r\nthe first of a number of his plays produced at Drury Lane. The other\r\npatent houses threw their doors open to him also (the Adelphi had\r\nalready done so); and in 1836 Jerrold became co-manager of the Strand\r\ntheatre with W. J. Hammond, his brother-in-law. The venture was not\r\nsuccessful, and the partnership was dissolved. While it lasted Jerrold\r\nwrote his only tragedy, _The Painter of Ghent_, and himself appeared in\r\nthe title-rôle, without any very marked success. He continued to write\r\nsparkling comedies till 1854, the date of his last piece, _The Heart of\r\nGold_.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he had won his way to the pages of numerous\r\nperiodicals--before 1830 of the second-rate magazines only, but after\r\nthat to those of more importance. He was a contributor to the _Monthly\r\nMagazine, Blackwood's,_ the _New Monthly_, and the _Athenaeum_. To\r\n_Punch_, the publication which of all others is associated with his\r\nname, he contributed from its second number in 1841 till within a few\r\ndays of his death. He founded and edited for some time, though with\r\nindifferent success, the _Illuminated Magazine, Jerrold's Shilling\r\nMagazine_, and _Douglas Jerrold's Weekly Newspaper;_ and under his\r\neditorship _Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper_ rose from almost nonentity to a\r\ncirculation of 182,000. The history of his later years is little more\r\nthan a catalogue of his literary productions, interrupted now and again\r\nby brief visits to the Continent or to the country. Douglas Jerrold died\r\nat his house, Kilburn Priory, in London, on the 8th of June 1857.\r\n\r\nJerrold's figure was small and spare, and in later years bowed almost to\r\ndeformity. His features were strongly marked and expressive from the\r\nthin humorous lips to the keen blue eyes gleaming from beneath the\r\nshaggy eyebrows. He was brisk and active, with the careless bluffness of\r\na sailor. Open and sincere, he concealed neither his anger nor his\r\npleasure; to his simple frankness all polite duplicity was distasteful.\r\nThe cynical side of his nature he kept for his writings; in private life\r\nhis hand was always open. In politics Jerrold was a Liberal, and he gave\r\neager sympathy to Kossuth, Mazzini and Louis Blanc. In social politics\r\nespecially he took an eager part; he never tired of declaiming against\r\nthe horrors of war, the luxury of bishops, and the iniquity of capital\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nDouglas Jerrold is now perhaps better known from his reputation as a\r\nbrilliant wit in conversation than from his writings. As a dramatist he\r\nwas very popular, though his plays have not kept the stage. He dealt\r\nwith rather humbler forms of social life than had commonly been\r\nrepresented on the boards. He was one of the first and certainly one of\r\nthe most successful of those who in defence of the native English drama\r\nendeavoured to stem the tide of translation from the French, which\r\nthreatened early in the 19th century altogether to drown original native\r\ntalent. His skill in construction and his mastery of epigram and\r\nbrilliant dialogue are well exemplified in his comedy, _Time Works\r\nWonders_ (Haymarket, April 26, 1845). The tales and sketches which form\r\nthe bulk of Jerrold's collected works vary much in skill and interest;\r\nbut, although there are evident traces of their having been composed\r\nfrom week to week, they are always marked by keen satirical observation\r\nand pungent wit.\r\n\r\n  Among the best known of his numerous works are: _Men of Character_\r\n  (1838), including \"Job Pippin: The man who couldn't help it,\" and\r\n  other sketches of the same kind; _Cakes and Ale_ (2 vols., 1842), a\r\n  collection of short papers and whimsical stories; some more serious\r\n  novels--_The Story of a Feather_ (1844), _The Chronicles of\r\n  Clovernook_ (1846), _A Man made of Money_ (1849); and _St Giles and St\r\n  James_ (1851); and various series of papers reprinted from\r\n  _Punch--Punch's Letters to his Son_ (1843), _Punch's Complete\r\n  Letter-writer_ (1845), and the famous _Mrs Caudle's Curtain Lectures_\r\n  (1846).\r\n\r\n  See W. B. Jerrold, _Life and Remains of Douglas Jerrold_ (1859). A\r\n  collected edition of his writings appeared in 1851-1854, and _The\r\n  Works of Douglas Jerrold_, with a memoir by his son, W. B. Jerrold, in\r\n  1863-1864; but neither is complete. Among the numerous selections from\r\n  his tales and witticisms are two edited by his grandson, Walter\r\n  Jerrold, _Bons Mots of Charles Dickens and Douglas Jerrold_ (new ed.\r\n  1904), and _The Essays of Douglas Jerrold_ (1903), illustrated by H.\r\n  M. Brock. See also _The Wit and Opinions of Douglas Jerrold_ (1858),\r\n  edited by W. B. Jerrold.\r\n\r\nHis eldest son, WILLIAM BLANCHARD JERROLD (1826-1884), English\r\njournalist and author, was born in London on the 23rd of December 1826,\r\nand abandoning the artistic career for which he was educated, began\r\nnewspaper work at an early age there. He was appointed Crystal Palace\r\ncommissioner to Sweden in 1853, and wrote _A Brage-Beaker with the\r\nSwedes_ (1854) on his return. In 1855 he was sent to the Paris\r\nexhibition as correspondent for several London papers, and from that\r\ntime he lived much in Paris. In 1857 he succeeded his father as editor\r\nof _Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper_, a post which he held for twenty-six\r\nyears. During the Civil War in America he strongly supported the North,\r\nand several of his leading articles were reprinted and placarded in New\r\nYork by the federal government. He was the founder and president of the\r\nEnglish branch of the international literary association for the\r\nassimilation of copyright laws. Four of his plays were successfully\r\nproduced on the London stage, the popular farce _Cool as a Cucumber_\r\n(Lyceum 1851) being the best known. His French experiences resulted in a\r\nnumber of books, most important of which is his _Life of Napoleon III_.\r\n(1874). He was occupied in writing the biography of Gustave Doré, who\r\nhad illustrated several of his books, when he died on the 10th of March\r\n1884.\r\n\r\n  Among his books are _A Story of Social Distinction_ (1848), _Life and\r\n  Remains of Douglas Jerrold_ (1859), _Up and Down in the World_ (1863),\r\n  _The Children of Lutetia_ (1864), _Cent per Cent_ (1871), _At Home in\r\n  Paris_ (1871), _The Best of all Good Company_ (1871-1873), and _The\r\n  Life of George Cruikshank_ (1882).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJERRY, a short form of the name Jeremiah, applied to various common\r\nobjects, and more particularly to a machine for finishing cloth. The\r\nexpression \"jerry-built\" is applied to houses built badly and of\r\ninferior materials, and run up by a speculative builder. There seems to\r\nbe no foundation for the assertion that this expression was occasioned\r\nby the work of a firm of Liverpool builders named Jerry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJERSEY, EARLS OF. Sir Edward Villiers (c. 1656-1711), son of Sir Edward\r\nVilliers (1620-1689), of Richmond, Surrey, was created Baron Villiers\r\nand Viscount Villiers in 1691 and earl of Jersey in 1697. His\r\ngrandfather, Sir Edward Villiers (c. 1585-1626), master of the mint and\r\npresident of Munster, was half-brother of George Villiers, 1st duke of\r\nBuckingham, and of Christopher Villiers, 1st earl of Anglesey; his\r\nsister was Elizabeth Villiers, the mistress of William III., and\r\nafterwards countess of Orkney. Villiers was knight-marshal of the royal\r\nhousehold in succession to his father; master of the horse to Queen\r\nMary; and lord chamberlain to William III. and Queen Anne. In 1696 he\r\nrepresented his country at the congress of Ryswick; he was ambassador\r\nat the Hague, and after becoming an earl was ambassador in Paris. In\r\n1699 he was made secretary of state for the southern department, and on\r\nthree occasions he was one of the lords justices of England. In 1704 he\r\nwas dismissed from office by Anne, and after this event he was concerned\r\nin some of the Jacobite schemes. He died on the 25th of August 1711. The\r\n2nd earl was his son William (c. 1682-1721), an adherent of the exiled\r\nhouse of Stuart, and the 3rd earl was the latter's son William (d.\r\n1769), who succeeded his kinsman John Fitzgerald (c. 1692-1766) as 6th\r\nViscount Grandison. The 3rd earl's son, George Bussy, the 4th earl\r\n(1735-1805), held several positions at the court of George III., and on\r\naccount of his courtly manners was called the \"prince of Maccaronies.\"\r\nThe 4th earl's son, George, 5th earl of Jersey (1773-1859), one of the\r\nmost celebrated fox-hunters of his time and a successful owner of\r\nracehorses, married Sarah Sophia (1785-1867), daughter of John Fane,\r\n10th earl of Westmorland, and granddaughter of Robert Child, the banker.\r\nShe inherited her grandfather's great wealth, including his interest in\r\nChild's bank, and with her husband took the name of Child-Villiers.\r\nSince this time the connexions of the earls of Jersey with Child's bank\r\nhas been maintained. Victor Albert George Child-Villiers (b. 1845)\r\nsucceeded his father George Augustus (1808-1859), 6th earl, who had only\r\nheld the title for three weeks, as 7th earl of Jersey in 1859. This\r\nnobleman was governor of New South Wales from 1890 to 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJERSEY, the largest of the Channel Islands, belonging to Great Britain.\r\nIts chief town, St Helier, on the south coast of the island, is in 49°\r\n12´ N., 2° 7´ W., 105 m. S. by E. of Portland Bill on the English coast,\r\nand 24 m. from the French coast to the east. Jersey is the southernmost\r\nof the more important islands of the group. It is of oblong form with a\r\nlength of 10 m. from east to west and an extreme breadth of 6¼ m. The\r\narea is 28,717 acres, or 45 sq. m. Pop. (1901), 52,576.\r\n\r\nThe island reaches its greatest elevation (nearly 500 ft.) in the north,\r\nthe land rising sharply from the north coast, and displaying bold and\r\npicturesque cliffs towards the sea. The east, south and west coasts\r\nconsist of a succession of large open bays, shallow and rocky, with\r\nmarshy or sandy shores separated by rocky headlands. The principal bays\r\nare Grève au Lançons, Grève de Lecq, St John's and Bouley Bays on the\r\nnorth coast; St Catherine's and Grouville Bays on the east; St\r\nClement's, St Aubin's and St Brelade's Bays on the south; and St Ouen's\r\nBay, the wide sweep of which occupies nearly the whole of the west\r\ncoast. The sea in many places has encroached greatly on the land, and\r\nsand drifts have been found troublesome, especially on the west coast.\r\nThe surface of the country is broken by winding valleys having a general\r\ndirection from north to south, and as they approach the south uniting so\r\nas to form small plains. The lofty hedges which bound the small\r\nenclosures into which Jersey is divided, the trees and shrubberies which\r\nline the roads and cluster round the uplands and in almost every nook of\r\nthe valleys unutilized for pasturage or tillage, give the island a\r\nluxuriant appearance, neutralizing the bare effect of the few sandy\r\nplains and sand-covered hills. Fruits and flowers indigenous to warm\r\nclimates grow freely in the open air. The land, under careful\r\ncultivation, is rich and productive, the soil being generally a deep\r\nloam, especially in the valleys, but in the west shallow, light and\r\nsandy. The subsoil is usually gravel, but in some parts an unfertile\r\nclay. Some two-thirds of the total area is under cultivation, great\r\nnumbers of cattle being pastured, and much market gardening practised.\r\nThe potato crop is very large. The peasants take advantage of every bit\r\nof wall and every isolated nook of ground for growing fruit trees.\r\nGrapes are ripened under glass; oranges can be grown in sheltered\r\nsituations, but the most common fruits are apples, which are used for\r\ncider, and pears. A manure of burnt sea-weed (vraic) is generally used.\r\nThe pasturage is very rich, and is much improved by the application of\r\nthis manure to the surface. The breed of cattle is kept pure by\r\nstringent laws against the importation of foreign animals. The milk is\r\nused almost exclusively to manufacture butter. The cattle are always\r\nhoused in winter, but remain out at night from May till October. There\r\nwas formerly a small black breed of horses peculiar to the island, but\r\nhorses are now chiefly imported from France or England. Pigs are kept\r\nprincipally for local consumption, and only a few sheep are reared. Fish\r\nare not so plentiful as round the shores of Guernsey, but mackerel,\r\nturbot, cod, mullet and especially the conger eel are abundant at the\r\nMinquiers. There is a large oyster bed between Jersey and France, but\r\npartly on account of over-dredging the supply is not so abundant as\r\nformerly. There is a great variety of other shell fish. The fisheries,\r\nship-building and boat-building employ many of the inhabitants. Kelp and\r\niodine are manufactured from sea-weed. The principal exports are\r\ngranite, fruit and vegetables (especially potatoes), butter and cattle;\r\nand the chief imports coal and articles of human consumption.\r\nCommunications with England are maintained principally from Southampton\r\nand Weymouth, and there are regular steamship services from Granville\r\nand St Malo on the French coast. The Jersey railway runs west from St\r\nHelier round St Aubin's Bay to St Aubin, and continues to Corbière at\r\nthe south-western extremity of the island; and the Jersey eastern\r\nrailway follows the southern and eastern coasts to Gorey. The island is\r\nintersected with a network of good roads.\r\n\r\nJersey is under a distinct and in several respects different form of\r\nadministrative government from Guernsey and the smaller islands included\r\nin the bailiwick of Guernsey. For its peculiar constitution, system of\r\njustice, ecclesiastical arrangements and finance, see CHANNEL ISLANDS.\r\nThere are twelve parishes, namely St Helier, Grouville, St Brelade, St\r\nClement, St John, St Laurence, St Martin, St Mary, St Ouen, St Peter, St\r\nSaviour and Trinity. The population of the island nearly doubled between\r\n1821 and 1901, but decreased from 54,518 to 52,576 between 1891 and\r\n1901.\r\n\r\nThe history of Jersey is treated under CHANNEL ISLANDS. Among objects of\r\nantiquarian interest, a cromlech near Mont Orgueil is the finest of\r\nseveral examples. St Brelade's church, probably the oldest in the\r\nisland, dates from the 12th century; among the later churches St\r\nHelier's, of the 14th century, may be mentioned. There are also some\r\nvery early chapels, considered to date from the 10th century or earlier;\r\namong these may be noted the Chapelle-ès-Pêcheurs at St Brelade's, and\r\nthe picturesque chapel in the grounds of the manor of Rozel. The castle\r\nof Mont Orgueil, of which there are considerable remains, is believed to\r\nbe founded upon the site of a Roman stronghold, and a \"Caesar's fort\"\r\nstill forms a part of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJERSEY CITY, a city and the county-seat of Hudson county, New Jersey,\r\nU.S.A., on a peninsula between the Hudson and Hackensack rivers at the\r\nN. and between New York and Newark bays at the S., opposite lower\r\nManhattan Island. Pop. (1890), 163,003; (1900), 206,433, of whom 58,424\r\nwere foreign-born (19,314 Irish, 17,375 German, 4642 English, 3832\r\nItalian, 1694 Russian, 1690 Scottish, 1643 Russian Poles, 1445 Austrian)\r\nand 3704 were negroes; (1910 census) 267,779. It is the eastern terminus\r\nof the Pennsylvania, the Lehigh Valley, the West Shore, the Central of\r\nNew Jersey, the Baltimore & Ohio, the Northern of New Jersey (operated\r\nby the Erie), the Erie, the New York, Susquehanna & Western, and the New\r\nJersey & New York (controlled by the Erie) railways, the first three\r\nusing the Pennsylvania station; and of the little-used Morris canal.\r\nJersey City is served by several inter-urban electric railways and by\r\nthe tunnels of the Hudson & Manhattan railroad company to Dey St. and to\r\n33rd St. and 6th Ave., New York City, and it also has docks of several\r\nlines of Transatlantic and coast steamers. The city occupies a land area\r\nof 14.3 sq. m. and has a water-front of about 12 m. Bergen Hill, a\r\nsoutherly extension of the Palisades, extends longitudinally through it\r\nfrom north to south. At the north end this hill rises on the east side\r\nprecipitously to a height of nearly 200 ft.; on the west and south sides\r\nthe slope is gradual. On the crest of the hill is the fine Hudson County\r\nBoulevard, about 19 m. long and 100 ft. wide, extending through the city\r\nand county from north to south and passing through West Side Park, a\r\nsplendid county park containing lakes and a 70-acre playground. The\r\nwater-front, especially on the east side, is given up to manufacturing\r\nand shipping establishments. In the hill section are the better\r\nresidences, most of which are wooden and detached.\r\n\r\n  The principal buildings are the city hall and the court house. There\r\n  are nine small city parks with an aggregate area of 39.1 acres. The\r\n  city has a public library containing (1907) 107,600 volumes and an\r\n  historical museum. At the corner of Bergen Ave. and Forrest St. is the\r\n  People's Palace, given in 1904 by Joseph Milbank to the First\r\n  Congregational church and containing a library and reading-room, a\r\n  gymnasium, bowling alleys, a billiard-room, a rifle-range, a\r\n  roof-garden, and an auditorium and theatre; kindergarten classes are\r\n  held and an employment bureau is maintained. Among the educational\r\n  institutions are the German American school, Hasbrouck institute, St\r\n  Aloysius academy (Roman Catholic) and St Peter's college (Roman\r\n  Catholic); and there are good public schools. Grain is shipped to and\r\n  from Jersey City in large quantities, and in general the city is an\r\n  important shipping port; being included, however, in the port of New\r\n  York, no separate statistics are available. There are large\r\n  slaughtering establishments, and factories for the refining of sugar\r\n  and for the manufacture of tobacco goods, soap and perfumery, lead\r\n  pencils, iron and steel, railway cars, chemicals, rubber goods, silk\r\n  goods, dressed lumber, and malt liquors. The value of the city's\r\n  manufactured products increased from $37,376,322 in 1890 to\r\n  $77,225,116 in 1900, or 106.6%; in 1905 the factory product alone was\r\n  valued at $75,740,934, an increase of only 3.9% over the factory\r\n  product in 1900, this small rate of increase being due very largely to\r\n  a decline in the value of the products of the sugar and molasses\r\n  refining industry. The value of the wholesale slaughtering and\r\n  meat-packing product decreased from $18,551,783 in 1880 and\r\n  $11,356,511 in 1890 to $6,243,217 in 1900--of this $5,708,763\r\n  represented wholesale slaughtering alone; in 1905 the wholesale\r\n  slaughtering product was valued at $7,568,739.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 the assessed valuation of the city was $267,039,754. The city is\r\ngoverned by a board of aldermen and a mayor (elected biennially), who\r\nappoints most of the officials, the street and water board being the\r\nprincipal exception.\r\n\r\nJersey City when first incorporated was a small sandy peninsula (an\r\nisland at high tide) known as Paulus Hook, directly opposite the lower\r\nend of Manhattan Island. It had been a part of the Dutch patroonship of\r\nPavonia granted to Michael Pauw in 1630. In 1633 the first buildings\r\nwere erected, and for more than a century the Hook was occupied by a\r\nsmall agricultural and trading community. In 1764 a new post route\r\nbetween New York and Philadelphia passed through what is now the city,\r\nand direct ferry communication began with New York. Early in the War of\r\nIndependence Paulus Hook was fortified by the Americans, but soon after\r\nthe battle of Long Island they abandoned it, and on the 23rd of\r\nSeptember 1776 it was occupied by the British. On the morning of the\r\n19th of August 1779 the British garrison was surprised by Major Henry\r\nLee (\"Light Horse Harry\"), who with about 500 men took 159 prisoners and\r\nlost only 2 killed and 3 wounded, one of the most brilliant exploits\r\nduring the War of Independence. In 1804 Paulus Hook, containing 117\r\nacres and having about 15 inhabitants, passed into the possession of\r\nthree enterprising New York lawyers, who laid it out as a town and\r\nformed an association for its government, which was incorporated as the\r\n\"associates of the Jersey company.\" In 1820 the town was incorporated as\r\nthe City of Jersey, but it remained a part of the township of Bergen\r\nuntil 1838, when it was reincorporated as a distinct municipality. In\r\n1851 the township of Van Vorst, founded in 1804 between Paulus Hook and\r\nHoboken, was annexed. In 1870 there were two annexations: to the south,\r\nthe town of Bergen, the county-seat, which was founded in 1660; to the\r\nnorth-west, Hudson City, which had been separated from the township of\r\nNorth Bergen in 1852 and incorporated as a city in 1855. The town of\r\nGreenville, to the south, was annexed in 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJERUSALEM (Heb. [Hebrew: Yerushalaïm] _Yerushalaïm_, pronounced as a\r\ndual), the chief city of Palestine. Letters found at Tell el-Amarna in\r\nEgypt, written by an early ruler of Jerusalem, show that the name\r\nexisted under the form _Urusalim_, i.e. \"City of Salim\" or \"City of\r\nPeace,\" many years before the Israelites under Joshua entered Canaan.\r\nThe emperor Hadrian, when he rebuilt the city, changed the name to Aelia\r\nCapitolina. The Arabs usually designate Jerusalem by names expressive of\r\nholiness, such as Beit el Makdis and El Mukaddis or briefly El Kuds,\r\ni.e. the Sanctuary.\r\n\r\n  _Natural Topography._--Jerusalem is situated in 31° 47´ N. and 35° 15´\r\n  E., in the hill country of southern Palestine, close to the watershed,\r\n  at an average altitude of 2500 ft. above the Mediterranean, and 3800\r\n  ft. above the level of the Dead Sea. The city stands on a rocky\r\n  plateau, which projects southwards from the main line of hills. On the\r\n  east the valley of the Kidron separates this plateau from the ridge of\r\n  the Mount of Olives, which is 100 to 200 ft. higher, while the Wadi Er\r\n  Rababi bounds Jerusalem on the west and south, meeting the Valley of\r\n  Kidron near the lower pool of Siloam. Both valleys fall rapidly as\r\n  they approach the point of junction, which lies at a depth of more\r\n  than 600 ft. below the general valley of the plateau. The latter,\r\n  which covers an area of about 1000 acres, has at the present time a\r\n  fairly uniform surface and slopes gradually from the north to the\r\n  south and east. Originally, however, its formation was very different,\r\n  as it was intersected by a deep valley, called Tyropoeon by Josephus,\r\n  which, starting from a point N.W. of the Damascus gate, followed a\r\n  course first south-east and then west of south, and joined the two\r\n  main valleys of Kidron and Er Rababi at Siloam. Another shorter valley\r\n  began near the present Jaffa gate and, taking an easterly direction,\r\n  joined the Tyropoeon; while a third ravine passed across what is now\r\n  the northern part of the Haram enclosure and fell into the valley of\r\n  the Kidron. The exact form of these three interior valleys, which had\r\n  an important influence on the construction and history of the city, is\r\n  still imperfectly known, as they are to a great extent obliterated by\r\n  vast accumulations of rubbish, which has filled them up in some places\r\n  to a depth of more than 100 ft. Their approximate form was only\r\n  arrived at by excavations made during the later years of the 19th\r\n  century. The limited knowledge which we possess of the original\r\n  features of the ground within the area of the city makes a\r\n  reconstruction of the topographical history of the latter a difficult\r\n  task; and, as a natural result, many irreconcilable theories have been\r\n  suggested. The difficulty is increased by the fact that the\r\n  geographical descriptions given in the Old Testament the Apocrypha and\r\n  the writings of Josephus are very short, and, having been written for\r\n  those who were acquainted with the places, convey insufficient\r\n  information to historians of the present day, when the sites are so\r\n  greatly altered. All that can be done is to form a continuous account\r\n  in accord with the ancient histories, and with the original formation\r\n  of the ground, so far as this has been identified by modern\r\n  exploration. But the progress of exploration and excavation may render\r\n  this subject to further modification.\r\n\r\n  The geological formation of the plateau consists of thin beds of hard\r\n  silicious chalk, locally called _misse_, which overlie a thick bed of\r\n  soft white limestone, known by the name of _meleke_. Both descriptions\r\n  of rock yielded good material for building; while in the soft _meleke_\r\n  tanks, underground chambers, tombs, &c., were easily excavated. In\r\n  ancient times a brook flowed down the valley of the Kidron, and it is\r\n  possible that a stream flowed also through the Tyropoeon valley. The\r\n  only known spring existing at present within the limits of the city is\r\n  the \"fountain of the Virgin,\" on the western side of the Kidron\r\n  valley, but there may have been others which are now concealed by the\r\n  accumulations of rubbish. Cisterns were also used for the storage of\r\n  rain water, and aqueducts, of which the remains still exist (see\r\n  AQUEDUCTS _ad init._), were constructed for the conveyance of water\r\n  from a distance. Speaking generally, it is probable that the water\r\n  supply of Jerusalem in ancient times was better than it is at present.\r\n\r\n_History._--The early history of Jerusalem is very obscure. The Tell\r\nel-Amarna letters show that, long before the invasion by Joshua, it was\r\noccupied by the Egyptians, and was probably a stronghold of considerable\r\nimportance, as it formed a good strategical position in the hill country\r\nof southern Palestine. We do not know how the Egyptians were forced to\r\nabandon Jerusalem; but, at the time of the Israelite conquest, it was\r\nundoubtedly in the hands of the Jebusites, the native inhabitants of the\r\ncountry. The exact position of the Jebusite city is unknown; some\r\nauthorities locate it on the western hill, now known as Zion; some on\r\nthe eastern hill, afterwards occupied by the Temple and the city of\r\nDavid; while others consider it was a double settlement, one part being\r\non the western, and the other on the eastern hill, separated from one\r\nanother by the Tyropoeon valley. The latter view appears to be the most\r\nprobable, as, according to the Biblical accounts, Jerusalem was partly\r\nin Judah and partly in Benjamin, the line of demarcation between the two\r\ntribes passing through the city. According to this theory, the part of\r\nJerusalem known as Jebus was situated on the western hill, and the\r\noutlying fort of Zion on the eastern hill. The men of Judah and Benjamin\r\ndid not succeed in getting full possession of the place, and the\r\nJebusites still held it when David became king of Israel. Some years\r\nafter his accession David succeeded after some difficulty in taking\r\nJerusalem. He established his royal city on the eastern hill close to\r\nthe site of the Jebusite Zion, while Jebus, the town on the western side\r\nof the Tyropoeon valley, became the civil city, of which Joab, David's\r\nleading general, was appointed governor. David surrounded the royal city\r\nwith a wall and built a citadel, probably on the site of the Jebusite\r\nfort of Zion, while Joab fortified the western town. North of the city\r\nof David, the king, acting under divine guidance, chose a site for the\r\nTemple of Jehovah, which was erected with great magnificence by Solomon.\r\nThe actual site occupied by this building has given rise to much\r\ncontroversy, though all authorities are agreed that it must have stood\r\non some part of the area now known as the Haram. James Fergusson was of\r\nopinion that the Temple stood near the south-western corner. As,\r\nhowever, it was proved by the explorations of Sir Charles Warren in\r\n1869-1870 that the Tyropoeon valley passed under this corner, and that\r\nthe foundations must have been of enormous depth, Fergusson's theory\r\nmust be regarded as untenable (see also SEPULCHRE, HOLY). On the whole\r\nit is most likely that the Temple was erected by Solomon on the same\r\nspot as is now occupied by the Dome of the Rock, commonly known as the\r\nMosque of Omar, and, regard being had to the levels of the ground, it is\r\npossible that the Holy of Holies, the most sacred chamber of the Temple,\r\nstood over the rock which is still regarded with veneration by the\r\nMahommedans. Solomon greatly strengthened the fortifications of\r\nJerusalem, and was probably the builder of the line of defence, called\r\nby Josephus the first or old wall, which united the cities on the\r\neastern and western hills. The kingdom reached its highest point of\r\nimportance during the reign of Solomon, but, shortly after his death, it\r\nwas broken up by the rebellion of Jeroboam, who founded the separate\r\nkingdom of Israel with its capital at Shechem. Two tribes only, Judah\r\nand Benjamin, with the descendants of Levi, remained faithful to\r\nRehoboam, the son of Solomon. Jerusalem thus lost much of its\r\nimportance, especially after it was forced to surrender to Shishak, king\r\nof Egypt, who carried off a great part of the riches which had been\r\naccumulated by Solomon. The history of Jerusalem during the succeeding\r\nthree centuries consists for the most part of a succession of wars\r\nagainst the kingdom of Israel, the Moabites and the Syrians. Joash, king\r\nof Israel, captured the city from Amaziah, king of Judah, and destroyed\r\npart of the fortifications, but these were rebuilt by Uzziah, the son of\r\nAmaziah, who did much to restore the city to its original prosperity. In\r\nthe reign of Hezekiah, the kingdom of Judah became tributary to the\r\nAssyrians, who attempted the capture of Jerusalem. Hezekiah improved the\r\ndefences and arranged for a good water supply, preparatory to the siege\r\nby Sennacherib, the Assyrian general. The siege failed and the Assyrians\r\nretired. Some years later Syria was again invaded by the Egyptians, who\r\nreduced Judah to the position of a tributary state. In the reign of\r\nZedekiah, the last of the line of kings, Jerusalem was captured by\r\nNebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, who pillaged the city, destroyed the\r\nTemple, and ruined the fortifications (see JEWS, § 17). A number of the\r\nprincipal inhabitants were carried captive to Babylon, and Jerusalem was\r\nreduced to the position of an insignificant town. Nebuchadrezzar placed\r\nin the city a garrison which appears to have been quartered on the\r\nwestern hill, while the eastern hill on which were the Temple and the\r\ncity of David was left more or less desolate. We have no information\r\nregarding Jerusalem during the period of the captivity, but fortunately\r\nNehemiah, who was permitted to return and rebuild the defences about 445\r\nB.C., has given a fairly clear description of the line of the wall which\r\nenables us to obtain a good idea of the extent of the city at this\r\nperiod. The Temple had already been partially rebuilt by Zedekiah and\r\nhis companions, but on a scale far inferior to the magnificent building\r\nof King Solomon, and Nehemiah devoted his attention to the\r\nreconstruction of the walls. Before beginning the work, he made a\r\npreliminary reconnaissance of the fortifications on the south of the\r\ntown from the Valley Gate, which was near the S.E. corner, to the pool\r\nof Siloam and valley of the Kidron. He then allotted the reconstruction\r\nof wall and gates to different parties of workmen, and his narrative\r\ndescribes the portion of wall upon which each of these was employed.[1]\r\n\r\n  It is clear from his account that the lines of fortifications included\r\n  both the eastern and western hills. North of the Temple enclosure\r\n  there was a gate, known as the Sheep Gate, which must have opened into\r\n  the third valley mentioned above, and stood somewhere near what is now\r\n  the north side of the Haram enclosure, but considerably south of the\r\n  present north wall of the latter. To the west of the Sheep Gate there\r\n  were two important towers in the wall, called respectively Meah and\r\n  Hananeel. The tower Hananeel is specially worthy of notice as it stood\r\n  N.W. of the Temple and probably formed the basis of the citadel built\r\n  by Simon Maccabaeus, which again was succeeded by the fortress of\r\n  Antonia, constructed by Herod the Great, and one of the most important\r\n  positions at the time of the siege by Titus. At or near the tower\r\n  Hananeel the wall turned south along the east side of the Tyropoeon\r\n  valley, and then again westward, crossing the valley at a point\r\n  probably near the remarkable construction known as Wilson's arch. A\r\n  gate in the valley, known as the Fish Gate, opened on a road which,\r\n  leading from the north, went down the Tyropoeon valley to the southern\r\n  part of the city. Westward of this gate the wall followed the south\r\n  side of the valley which joined the Tyropoeon from the west as far as\r\n  the north-western corner of the city at the site of the present Jaffa\r\n  Gate and the so-called tower of David. In this part of the wall there\r\n  were apparently two gates facing north, i.e. the Old Gate and the Gate\r\n  of Ephraim, 400 cubits from the corner.[2] At the corner stood the\r\n  residence of the Babylonian governor, near the site upon which King\r\n  Herod afterwards built his magnificent palace. From the corner at the\r\n  governor's house, the wall went in a southerly direction and turned\r\n  south-east to the Valley Gate, remains of which were discovered by F.\r\n  J. Bliss and fully described in his _Excavations in Jerusalem in\r\n  1894-1897_. From the Valley Gate the wall took an easterly course for\r\n  a distance of 1000 cubits to the Dung Gate, near which on the east was\r\n  the Fountain Gate, not far from the lower pool of Siloam. Here was the\r\n  most southerly point of Jerusalem, and the wall turning hence to the\r\n  north followed the west side of the valley of the Kidron, enclosing\r\n  the city of David and the Temple enclosure, and finally turning west\r\n  at some point near the site of the Golden Gate joined the wall,\r\n  already described, at the Sheep Gate. Nehemiah mentions a number of\r\n  places on the eastern hill, including the tomb of David, the positions\r\n  of which cannot with our present knowledge be fixed with any\r\n  certainty.\r\n\r\nAfter the restoration of the walls of Jerusalem by Nehemiah, a\r\nconsiderable number of Jews returned to the city, but we know\r\npractically nothing of its history for more than a century until, in 332\r\nB.C., Alexander the Great conquered Syria. The gates of Jerusalem were\r\nopened to him and he left the Jews in peaceful occupation. But his\r\nsuccessors did not act with similar leniency; when the city was captured\r\nby Ptolemy I., king of Egypt, twelve years later, the fortifications\r\nwere partially demolished and apparently not again restored until the\r\nperiod of the high priest Simon II., who repaired the defences and also\r\nthe Temple buildings. In 168 B.C. Antiochus Epiphanes captured\r\nJerusalem, destroyed the walls, and devastated the Temple, reducing the\r\ncity to a worse position than it had occupied since the time of the\r\ncaptivity. He built a citadel called the Acra to dominate the town and\r\nplaced in it a strong garrison of Greeks. The position of the Acra is\r\ndoubtful, but it appears most probable that it stood on the eastern hill\r\nbetween the Temple and the city of David, both of which it commanded.\r\nSome writers place it north of the Temple on the site afterwards\r\noccupied by the fortress of Antonia, but such a position is not in\r\naccord with the descriptions either in Josephus or in the books of the\r\nMaccabees, which are quite consistent with each other. Other writers\r\nagain have placed the Acra on the eastern side of the hill upon which\r\nthe church of the Holy Sepulchre now stands, but as this point was\r\nprobably quite outside the city at the time of Antiochus Epiphanes, and\r\nis at too great a distance from the Temple, it can hardly be accepted.\r\nBut the site which has been already indicated at the N.E. corner of the\r\npresent Mosque el Aksa meets the accounts of the ancient authorities\r\nbetter than any other. At this point in the Haram enclosure there is an\r\nenormous underground cistern, known as the Great Sea, and this may\r\npossibly have been the source of water supply for the Greek garrison.\r\nThe oppression of Antiochus led to a revolt of the Jews under the\r\nleadership of the Maccabees, and Judas Maccabaeus succeeded in capturing\r\nJerusalem after severe fighting, but could not get possession of the\r\nAcra, which caused much trouble to the Jews, who erected a wall between\r\nit and the Temple, and another wall to cut it off from the city. The\r\nGreeks held out for a considerable time, but had finally to surrender,\r\nprobably from want of food, to Simon Maccabaeus, who demolished the Acra\r\nand cut down the hill upon which it stood so that it might no longer be\r\nhigher than the Temple, and that there should be no separation between\r\nthe latter and the city. Simon then constructed a new citadel, north of\r\nthe Temple, to take the place of the Acra, and established in Judaea the\r\nAsmonean dynasty, which lasted for nearly a century, when the Roman\r\nrepublic began to make its influence felt in Syria. In 65 B.C. Jerusalem\r\nwas captured by Pompey after a difficult siege. The Asmonean dynasty\r\nlasted a few years longer, but finally came to an end when Herod the\r\nGreat, with the aid of the Romans, took possession of Jerusalem and\r\nbecame the first king of the Idumaean dynasty. Herod again raised the\r\ncity to the position of an important capital, restoring the\r\nfortifications, and rebuilding the Temple from its foundations. He also\r\nbuilt the great fortress of Antonia, N.W. of the Temple, on the site of\r\nthe citadel of the Asmoneans, and constructed a magnificent palace for\r\nhimself on the western hill, defended by three great towers, which he\r\nnamed Mariamne, Hippicus and Phasaelus. At some period between the time\r\nof the Maccabees and of Herod, a second or outer wall had been built\r\noutside and north of the first wall, but it is not possible to fix an\r\naccurate date to this line of defence, as the references to it in\r\nJosephus are obscure. Herod adorned the town with other buildings and\r\nconstructed a theatre and gymnasium. He doubled the area of the\r\nenclosure round the Temple, and there can be little doubt that a great\r\npart of the walls of the Haram area date from the time of Herod, while\r\nprobably the tower of David, which still exists near the Jaffa Gate, is\r\non the same foundation as one of the towers adjoining his palace.\r\nArchelaus, Herod's successor, had far less authority than Herod, and the\r\nreal power of government at Jerusalem was assumed by the Roman\r\nprocurators, in the time of one of whom, Pontius Pilate, Jesus Christ\r\nwas condemned to death and crucified outside Jerusalem. The places of\r\nhis execution and burial are not certainly known (see SEPULCHRE, HOLY).\r\n\r\nHerod Agrippa, who succeeded to the kingdom, built a third or outer wall\r\non the north side of Jerusalem in order to enclose and defend the\r\nbuildings which had gradually been constructed outside the old\r\nfortifications. The exact line of this third wall is not known with\r\ncertainty, but it probably followed approximately the same line as the\r\nexisting north wall of Jerusalem. Some writers have considered that it\r\nextended a considerable distance farther to the north, but of this there\r\nis no proof, and no remains have as yet been found which would support\r\nthe opinion. The wall of Herod Agrippa was planned on a grand scale, but\r\nits execution was stopped by the Romans, so that it was not completed at\r\nthe time of the siege of Jerusalem by Titus. The writings of Josephus\r\ngive a good idea of the fortifications and buildings of Jerusalem at the\r\ntime of the siege, and his accurate personal knowledge makes his account\r\nworthy of the most careful perusal. He explains clearly how Titus,\r\nbeginning his attack from the north, captured the third or outer wall,\r\nthen the second wall, and finally the fortress of Antonia, the Temple,\r\nand the upper city. After the capture, Titus ordered the Temple to be\r\ndemolished and the fortifications to be levelled, with the exception of\r\nthe three great towers at Herod's palace. It is, however, uncertain how\r\nfar the order was carried out, and it is probable that the outer walls\r\nof the Temple enclosure were left partially standing and that the\r\ndefences on the west and south of the city were not completely levelled.\r\nWhen Titus and his army withdrew from Jerusalem, the 10th legion was\r\nleft as a permanent Roman garrison, and a fortified camp for their\r\noccupation was established on the western hill. We have no account of\r\nthe size or position of this camp, but a consideration of the site, and\r\na comparison with other Roman camps in various parts of Europe, make it\r\nprobable that it occupied an area of about 50 acres, extending over what\r\nis now known as the Armenian quarter of the town, and that it was\r\nbounded on the north by the old or first wall, on the west also by the\r\nold wall, on the south by a line of defence somewhat in the same\r\nposition as the present south wall where it passes the Zion Gate, and on\r\nthe east by an entrenchment running north and south parallel to the\r\nexisting thoroughfare known as David Street. For sixty years the Roman\r\ngarrison were left in undisturbed occupation, but in 132 the Jews rose\r\nin revolt under the leadership of Bar-Cochebas or Barcochba, and took\r\npossession of Jerusalem. After a severe struggle, the revolt was\r\nsuppressed by the Roman general, Julius Severus, and Jerusalem was\r\nrecaptured and again destroyed. According to some writers, this\r\ndevastation was even more complete than after the siege by Titus. About\r\n130 the emperor Hadrian decided to rebuild Jerusalem, and make it a\r\nRoman colony. The new city was called Aelia Capitolina. The exact size\r\nof the city is not known, but it probably extended as far as the present\r\nnorth wall of Jerusalem and included the northern part of the western\r\nhill. A temple dedicated to Jupiter Capitolinus was erected on the site\r\nof the Temple, and other buildings were constructed, known as the\r\nTheatre, the Demosia, the Tetranymphon, the Dodecapylon and the Codra.\r\nThe Jews were forbidden to reside in the city, but Christians were\r\nfreely admitted. The history of Jerusalem during the period between the\r\nfoundation of the city of Aelia by the emperor Hadrian and the accession\r\nof Constantine the Great in 306 is obscure, but no important change\r\nappears to have been made in the size or fortifications of the city,\r\nwhich continued as a Roman colony. In 326 Constantine, after his\r\nconversion to Christianity, issued orders to the bishop Macarius to\r\nrecover the site of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, and the tomb in\r\nwhich his body was laid (see SEPULCHRE, HOLY). After the holy sites had\r\nbeen determined, Constantine gave orders for the construction of two\r\nmagnificent churches, the one over the tomb and the other over the place\r\nwhere the cross was discovered. The present church of the Holy Sepulchre\r\nstands on the site upon which one of the churches of Constantine was\r\nbuilt, but the second church, the Basilica of the Cross, has completely\r\ndisappeared. The next important epoch in building construction at\r\nJerusalem was about 460, when the empress Eudocia visited Palestine and\r\nexpended large sums oh the improvement of the city. The walls were\r\nrepaired by her orders, and the line of fortifications appears to have\r\nbeen extended on the south so as to include the pool of Siloam. A church\r\nwas built above the pool, probably at the same time, and, after having\r\ncompletely disappeared for many centuries, it was recovered by F. J.\r\nBliss when making his exploration of Jerusalem. The empress also erected\r\na large church in honour of St Stephen north of the Damascus Gate, and\r\nis believed to have been buried therein. The site of this church was\r\ndiscovered in 1874, and it has since been rebuilt. In the 6th century\r\nthe emperor Justinian erected a magnificent basilica at Jerusalem, in\r\nhonour of the Virgin Mary, and attached to it two hospitals, one for the\r\nreception of pilgrims and one for the accommodation of the sick poor.\r\nThe description given by Procopius does not indicate clearly where this\r\nchurch was situated. A theory frequently put forward is that it stood\r\nwithin the Haram area near the Mosque of el Aksa, but it is more\r\nprobable that it was on Zion, near the traditional place of the\r\nCoenaculum or last supper, where the Mahommedan building known as the\r\ntomb of David now stands. In 614 Chosroes II., the king of Persia,\r\ncaptured Jerusalem, devastated many of the buildings, and massacred a\r\ngreat number of the inhabitants. The churches at the Holy Sepulchre were\r\nmuch damaged, but were partially restored by the monk Modestus, who\r\ndevoted himself with great energy to the work. After a severe struggle\r\nthe Persians were defeated by the emperor Heraclius, who entered\r\nJerusalem in triumph in 629 bringing with him the holy cross, which had\r\nbeen carried off by Chosroes. At this period the religion of Mahomet was\r\nspreading over the east, and in 637 the caliph Omar marched on\r\nJerusalem, which capitulated after a siege of four months. Omar behaved\r\nwith great moderation, restraining his troops from pillage and leaving\r\nthe Christians in possession of their churches. A wooden mosque was\r\nerected near the site of the Temple, which was replaced by the Mosque\r\nof Aksa, built by the amir Abdalmalik (Abd el Malek), who also\r\nconstructed the Dome of the Rock, known as the Mosque of Omar, in 688.\r\nThe Mahommedans held Jerusalem until 1099, when it was captured by the\r\ncrusaders under Godfrey of Bouillon, and became the capital of the Latin\r\nKingdom of Jerusalem (see CRUSADES, vol. viii. p. 401) until 1187, when\r\nSaladin reconquered it, and rebuilt the walls. Since that time, except\r\nfrom 1229 to 1239, and from 1243 to 1244, the city has been held by the\r\nMahommedans. It was occupied by the Egyptian sultans until 1517, when\r\nthe Turks under Selim I. occupied Syria. Selim's successor, Suleiman the\r\nMagnificent, restored the fortifications, which since that time have\r\nbeen little altered.\r\n\r\n  _Modern Jerusalem._--Jerusalem is the chief town of a sanjak, governed\r\n  by a _mutessarif_, who reports directly to the Porte. It has the usual\r\n  executive and town councils, upon which the recognized religious\r\n  communities, or _millets_, have representatives; and it is garrisoned\r\n  by infantry of the V. army corps. The city is connected with its port,\r\n  Jaffa, by a carriage road, 41 m., and by a metre-gauge railway, 54 m.,\r\n  which was completed in 1892, and is worked by a French company. There\r\n  are also carriage roads to Bethlehem, Hebron and Jericho, and a road\r\n  to Nablus was in course of construction in 1909. Prior to 1858, when\r\n  the modern building period commenced, Jerusalem lay wholly within its\r\n  16th-century walls, and even as late as 1875 there were few private\r\n  residences beyond their limits. At present Jerusalem without the walls\r\n  covers a larger area than that within them. The growth has been\r\n  chiefly towards the north and north-west; but there are large suburbs\r\n  on the west, and on the south-west near the railway station on the\r\n  plain of Rephaim. The village of Siloam has also increased in size,\r\n  and the western slopes of Olivet are being covered with churches,\r\n  monasteries and houses. Amongst the most marked features of the change\r\n  that has taken place since 1875 are the growth of religious and\r\n  philanthropic establishments; the settlement of Jewish colonies from\r\n  Bokhara, Yemen and Europe; the migration of Europeans, old Moslem\r\n  families, and Jews from the city to the suburbs; the increased\r\n  vegetation, due to the numerous gardens and improved methods of\r\n  cultivation; the substitution of timber and red tiles for the vaulted\r\n  stone roofs which were so characteristic of the old city; the striking\r\n  want of beauty, grandeur, and harmony with their environment exhibited\r\n  by most of the new buildings; and the introduction of wheeled\r\n  transport, which, cutting into the soft limestone, has produced mud\r\n  and dust to an extent previously unknown. To facilitate communication\r\n  between the city and its suburbs, the Bab ez-Zahire, or Herod's Gate,\r\n  and a new gate, near the north-west angle of the walls, have been\r\n  opened; and a portion of the wall, adjoining the Jaffa Gate, has been\r\n  thrown down, to allow free access for carriages. Within the city the\r\n  principal streets have been roughly paved, and iron bars placed across\r\n  the narrow alleys to prevent the passage of camels. Without the walls\r\n  carriage roads have been made to the mount of Olives, the railway\r\n  station, and various parts of the suburbs, but they are kept in bad\r\n  repair. Little effort has been made to meet the increased sanitary\r\n  requirements of the larger population and wider inhabited area. There\r\n  is no municipal water-supply, and the main drain of the city\r\n  discharges into the lower pool of Siloam, which has become an open\r\n  cesspit. In several places the débris within the walls is saturated\r\n  with sewage, and the water of the Fountain of the Virgin, and of many\r\n  of the old cisterns, is unfit for drinking. Amongst the more important\r\n  buildings for ecclesiastical and philanthropic purposes erected to the\r\n  north of the city since 1860 are the Russian cathedral, hospice and\r\n  hospital; the French hospital of St Louis, and hospice and church of\r\n  St Augustine; the German schools, orphanages and hospitals; the new\r\n  hospital and industrial school of the London mission to the Jews; the\r\n  Abyssinian church; the church and schools of the Church missionary\r\n  society; the Anglican church, college and bishop's house; the\r\n  Dominican monastery, seminary and church of St Stephen; the Rothschild\r\n  hospital and girls' school; and the industrial school and workshops of\r\n  the Alliance Israélite. On the mount of Olives are the Russian church,\r\n  tower and hospice, near the chapel of the Ascension; the French\r\n  Paternoster church; the Carmelite nunnery; and the Russian church of\r\n  St Mary Magdalene, near Gethsemane. South of the city are the Armenian\r\n  monastery of Mount Zion and Bishop Gobat's school. On the west side\r\n  are the institution of the sisters of St Vincent; the Ratisbon school;\r\n  the Montefiore hospice; the British ophthalmic hospital of the knights\r\n  of St John; the convent and church of the Clarisses; and the Moravian\r\n  leper hospital. Within the city walls are the Latin Patriarchal church\r\n  and residence; the school of the Frères de la Doctrine Chrétienne; the\r\n  schools and printing house of the Franciscans; the Coptic monastery;\r\n  the German church of the Redeemer, and hospice; the United Armenian\r\n  church of the Spasm; the convent and school of the Soeurs de Zion; the\r\n  Austrian hospice; the Turkish school and museum; the monastery and\r\n  seminary of the Frères de la Mission Algérienne, with the restored\r\n  church of St Anne, the church, schools and hospital of the London\r\n  mission to the Jews; the Armenian seminary and Patriarchal buildings;\r\n  the Rothschild hospital; and Jewish hospices and synagogues. The\r\n  climate is naturally good, but continued neglect of sanitary\r\n  precautions has made the city unhealthy. During the summer months the\r\n  heat is tempered by a fresh sea-breeze, and there is usually a sharp\r\n  fall of temperature at night; but in spring and autumn the east and\r\n  south-east winds, which blow across the heated depression of the Ghor,\r\n  are enervating and oppressive. A dry season, which lasts from May to\r\n  October, is followed by a rainy season, divided into the early winter\r\n  and latter rains. Snow falls two years out of three, but soon melts.\r\n  The mean annual temperature is 62.8° F., the maximum 112°, and the\r\n  minimum 25°. The mean monthly temperature is lowest (47.2°) in\r\n  February, and highest (76.3°) in August. The mean annual rainfall\r\n  (1861 to 1899) is 26.06 in. The most unhealthy period is from 1st May\r\n  to 31st October, when there are, from time to time, outbreaks of\r\n  typhoid, small-pox, diphtheria and other epidemics. The unhealthiness\r\n  of the city is chiefly due to want of proper drainage, impure\r\n  drinking-water, miasma from the disturbed rubbish heaps, and\r\n  contaminated dust from the uncleansed roads and streets. The only\r\n  industry is the manufacture of olive-wood and mother-of-pearl goods\r\n  for sale to pilgrims and for export. The imports (see Joppa) are\r\n  chiefly food, clothing and building material. The population in 1905\r\n  was about 60,000 (Moslems 7000, Christians 13,000, Jews 40,000).\r\n  During the pilgrimage season it is increased by about 15,000\r\n  travellers and pilgrims.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Pal.

By far the most important of the many synods\r\nheld at Jerusalem (see Wetzer and Welte, _Kirchenlexikon_, 2nd ed., vi.\r\n1357 sqq.) is that of 1672; and its confession is the most vital\r\nstatement of faith made in the Greek Church during the past thousand\r\nyears. It refutes article by article the confession of Cyril Lucaris,\r\nwhich appeared in Latin at Geneva in 1629, and in Greek, with the\r\naddition of four \"questions,\" in 1633. Lucaris, who died in 1638 as\r\npatriarch of Constantinople, had corresponded with Western scholars and\r\nhad imbibed Calvinistic views. The great opposition which arose during\r\nhis lifetime continued after his death, and found classic expression in\r\nthe highly venerated confession of Petrus Mogilas, metropolitan of Kiev\r\n(1643). Though this was intended as a barrier against Calvinistic\r\ninfluences, certain Reformed writers, as well as Roman Catholics,\r\npersisted in claiming the support of the Greek Church for sundry of\r\ntheir own positions. Against the Calvinists the synod of 1672 therefore\r\naimed its rejection of unconditional predestination and of justification\r\nby faith alone, also its advocacy of what are substantially the Roman\r\ndoctrines of transubstantiation and of purgatory; the Oriental hostility\r\nto Calvinism had been fanned by the Jesuits. Against the Church of Rome,\r\nhowever, there was directed the affirmation that the Holy Ghost proceeds\r\nfrom the Father and not from both Father and Son; this rejection of the\r\n_filioque_ was not unwelcome to the Turks. Curiously enough, the synod\r\nrefused to believe that the heretical confession it refuted was actually\r\nby a former patriarch of Constantinople; yet the proofs of its\r\ngenuineness seem to most scholars overwhelming. In negotiations between\r\nAnglican and Russian churchmen the confession of Dositheus[1] usually\r\ncomes to the front.\r\n\r\n  TEXTS.--The confession of Dositheus, or the eighteen decrees of the\r\n  Synod of Jerusalem, appeared in 1676 at Paris as _Synodus\r\n  Bethlehemitica_; a revised text in 1678 as _Synodus Jerosolymitana_;\r\n  Hardouin, _Acta conciliorum_, vol. xi.; Kimmel, _Monumenta fidei\r\n  ecclesiae orientalis_ (Jena, 1850; critical edition); P.

W. by S. by rail, 318 ft.\r\nabove sea-level. Pop. (1901), 23,285. The place took its ancient name\r\nfrom the river Aesis (mod. Esino), upon the left bank of which it lies.\r\nIt still retains its picturesque medieval town walls. The Palazzo del\r\nComune is a fine, simple, early Renaissance building (1487-1503) by\r\nFrancesco di Giorgio Martini; the walls are of brick and the window and\r\ndoor-frames of stone, with severely restrained ornamentation. The\r\ncourtyard with its loggie was built by Andrea Sansovino in 1519. The\r\nlibrary contains some good pictures by Lorenzo Lotto. The castle was\r\nbuilt by Baccio Pontelli (1488), designer of the castle at Ostia\r\n(1483-1486). Jesi was the birthplace of the emperor Frederic II. (1194),\r\nand also of the musical composer, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi\r\n(1710-1736). The river Aesis formed the boundary of Italy proper from\r\nabout 250 B.C. to the time of Sulla (c. 82 B.C.); and, in Augustus'\r\ndivision of Italy, that between Umbria (the 6th region) and Picenum (the\r\n5th). The town itself was a colony, of little importance, except,\r\napparently, as a recruiting ground for the Roman army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJESSE, in the Bible, the father of David (q.v.), and as such often\r\nregarded as the first in the genealogy of Jesus Christ (cf. Isa. xi. 1,\r\n10). Hence the phrase \"tree of Jesse\" is applied to a design\r\nrepresenting the descent of Jesus from the royal line of David, formerly\r\na favourite ecclesiastical ornament. From a recumbent figure of Jesse\r\nsprings a tree bearing in its branches the chief figures in the line of\r\ndescent, and terminating in the figure of Jesus, or of the Virgin and\r\nChild. There are remains of such a tree in the church of St Mary at\r\nAbergavenny, carved in wood, and supposed to have once stood behind the\r\nhigh altar. Jesse candelabra were also made. At Laon and Amiens there\r\nare sculptured Jesses over the central west doorways of the cathedrals.\r\nThe design was chiefly used in windows. The great east window at Wells\r\nand the window at the west end of the nave at Chartres are fine\r\nexamples. There is a 16th-century Jesse window from Mechlin in St\r\nGeorge's, Hanover Square, London. The Jesse window in the choir of\r\nDorchester Abbey, Oxfordshire, is remarkable in that the tree forms the\r\ncentral mullion, and many of the figures are represented as statuettes\r\non the branches of the upper tracery; other figures are in the stained\r\nglass; the whole gives a beautiful example of the combination of glass\r\nand carved stonework in one design.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJESSE, EDWARD (1780-1868), English writer on natural history, was born\r\non the 14th of January 1780, at Hutton Cranswick, Yorkshire, where his\r\nfather was vicar of the parish. He became clerk in a government office\r\nin 1798, and for a time was secretary to Lord Dartmouth, when president\r\nof the Board of Control. In 1812 he was appointed commissioner of\r\nhackney coaches, and later he became deputy surveyor-general of the\r\nroyal parks and palaces. On the abolition of this office he retired on a\r\npension, and he died at Brighton on the 28th of March 1868.\r\n\r\n  The result of his interest in the habits and characteristics of\r\n  animals was a series of pleasant and popular books on natural history,\r\n  the principal of which are _Gleanings in Natural History_ (1832-1835);\r\n  _An Angler's Rambles_ (1836); _Anecdotes of Dogs_ (1846); and\r\n  _Lectures on Natural History_ (1863). He also edited Izaak Walton's\r\n  _Compleat Angler_, Gilbert White's _Selborne_, and L. Ritchie's\r\n  _Windsor Castle_, and wrote a number of handbooks to places of\r\n  interest, including Windsor and Hampton Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJESSE, JOHN HENEAGE (1815-1874), English historian, son of Edward Jesse,\r\nwas educated at Eton, and afterwards became a clerk in the secretary's\r\ndepartment of the admiralty. He died in London on the 7th of July 1874.\r\nHis poem on Mary Queen of Scots was published about 1831, and was\r\nfollowed by a collection of poems entitled _Tales of the Dead_. He also\r\nwrote a drama, _Richard III._, and a fragmentary poem entitled _London_.\r\nNone of these ventures achieved any success, but his numerous historical\r\nworks are written with vivacity and interest, and, in their own style,\r\nare an important contribution to the history of England. They include\r\n_Memoirs of the Court of England during the Reign of the Stuarts_\r\n(1840), _Memoirs of the Court of England from the Revolution of 1688 to\r\nthe Death of George II._ (1843), _George Selwyn and his Contemporaries_\r\n(1843, new ed. 1882), _Memoirs of the Pretenders and their Adherents_\r\n(1845), _Memoirs of Richard the Third and his Contemporaries_ (1861),\r\nand _Memoirs of the Life and Reign of King George the Third_ (1867). The\r\ntitles of these works are sufficiently indicative of their character.\r\nThey are sketches of the principal personages and of the social details\r\nof various periods in the history of England rather than complete and\r\ncomprehensive historical narratives. In addition to these works Jesse\r\nwrote _Literary and Historical Memorials of London_ (1847), _London and\r\nits Celebrities_ (1850), and a new edition of this work as _London: its\r\nCelebrated Characters and Remarkable Places_ (1871). His _Memoirs of\r\nCelebrated Etonians_ appeared in 1875.\r\n\r\n  A collected edition containing most of his works in thirty volumes was\r\n  published in London in 1901.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJESSEL, SIR GEORGE (1824-1883), English judge, was born in London on the\r\n13th of February 1824. He was the son of Zadok Aaron Jessel, a Jewish\r\ncoral merchant. George Jessel was educated at a school for Jews at Kew,\r\nand being prevented by then existing religious disabilities from\r\nproceeding to Oxford or Cambridge, went to University College, London.\r\nHe entered as a student at Lincoln's Inn in 1842, and a year later took\r\nhis B.A. degree at the university of London, becoming M.A. and gold\r\nmedallist in mathematics and natural philosophy in 1844. In 1846 he\r\nbecame a fellow of University College, and in 1847 he was called to the\r\nbar at Lincoln's Inn. His earnings during his first three years at the\r\nbar were 52, 346, and 795 guineas, from which it will be seen that his\r\nrise to a tolerably large practice was rapid. His work, however, was\r\nmainly conveyancing, and for long his income remained almost stationary.\r\nBy degrees, however, he got more work, and was called within the bar in\r\n1865, becoming a bencher of his Inn in the same year and practising in\r\nthe Rolls Court. Jessel entered parliament as Liberal member for Dover\r\nin 1868, and although neither his intellect nor his oratory was of a\r\nclass likely to commend itself to his fellow-members, he attracted\r\nGladstone's attention by two learned speeches on the Bankruptcy Bill\r\nwhich was before the house in 1869, with the result that in 1871 he was\r\nappointed solicitor-general. His reputation at this time stood high in\r\nthe chancery courts; on the common law side he was unknown, and on the\r\nfirst occasion upon which he came into the court of Queen's bench to\r\nmove on behalf of the Crown, there was very nearly a collision between\r\nhim and the bench. His forceful and direct method of bringing his\r\narguments home to the bench was not modified in his subsequent practice\r\nbefore it. His great powers were fully recognized; his business in\r\naddition to that on behalf of the Crown became very large, and his\r\nincome for three years before he was raised to the bench amounted to\r\nnearly £25,000 per annum. In 1873 Jessel succeeded Lord Romilly as\r\nmaster of the rolls. From 1873 to 1881 Jessel sat as a judge of first\r\ninstance in the rolls court, being also a member of the court of appeal.\r\nIn November 1874 the first Judicature Act came into effect, and in 1881\r\nthe Judicature Act of that year made the master of the rolls the\r\nordinary president of the first court of appeal, relieving him of his\r\nduties as a judge of first instance. In the court of appeal Jessel\r\npresided almost to the day of his death. For some time before 1883 he\r\nsuffered from diabetes with chronic disorder of the heart and liver, but\r\nstruggled against it; on the 16th of March 1883 he sat in court for the\r\nlast time, and on the 21st of March he died at his residence in London,\r\nthe immediate cause of death being cardiac syncope.\r\n\r\nAs a judge of first instance Jessel was a revelation to those accustomed\r\nto the proverbial slowness of the chancery courts and of the master of\r\nthe rolls who preceded him. He disposed of the business before him with\r\nrapidity combined with correctness of judgment, and he not only had no\r\narrears himself, but was frequently able to help other judges to clear\r\ntheir lists. His knowledge of law and equity was wide and accurate, and\r\nhis memory for cases and command of the principles laid down in them\r\nextraordinary. In the rolls court he never reserved a judgment, not even\r\nin the Epping Forest case (_Commissioners of Sewers_ v. _Glasse_, L.R.\r\n19 Eq.; _The Times_, 11th November 1874), in which the evidence and\r\narguments lasted twenty-two days (150 witnesses being examined in court,\r\nwhile the documents went back to the days of King John), and in the\r\ncourt of appeal he did so only twice, and then in deference to the\r\nwishes of his colleagues. The second of these two occasions was the case\r\nof _Robarts_ v. _The Corporation of London_ (49 _Law Times_ 455; _The\r\nTimes_, 10th March 1883), and those who may read Jessel's judgment\r\nshould remember that, reviewing as it does the law and custom on the\r\nsubject, and the records of the city with regard to the appointment of a\r\nremembrancer from the 16th century, together with the facts of the case\r\nbefore the court, it occupied nearly an hour to deliver, but was\r\nnevertheless delivered without notes--this, too, on the 9th of March\r\n1883, when the judge who uttered it was within a fortnight of his death.\r\nNever during the 19th century was the business of any court performed so\r\nrapidly, punctually, and satisfactorily as it was when Jessel presided.\r\nHe was master of the rolls at a momentous period of legal history. The\r\nJudicature Acts, completing the fusion of law and equity, were passed\r\nwhile he was judge of first instance, and were still new to the courts\r\nwhen he died. His knowledge and power of assimilating knowledge of all\r\nsubjects, his mastery of every branch of law with which he had to\r\nconcern himself, as well as of equity, together with his willingness to\r\ngive effect to the new system, caused it to be said when he died that\r\nthe success of the Judicature Acts would have been impossible without\r\nhim. His faults as a judge lay in his disposition to be intolerant of\r\nthose who, not able to follow the rapidity of his judgment, endeavoured\r\nto persist in argument after he had made up his mind; but though he was\r\nperemptory with the most eminent counsel, young men had no cause to\r\ncomplain of his treatment of them.\r\n\r\nJessel sat on the royal commission for the amendment of the Medical\r\nActs, taking an active part in the preparation of its report. He\r\nactively interested himself in the management of London University, of\r\nwhich he was a fellow from 1861, and of which he was elected\r\nvice-chancellor in 1880. He was one of the commissioners of patents, and\r\ntrustee of the British Museum. He was also chairman of the committee of\r\njudges which drafted the new rules rendered necessary by the Judicature\r\nActs. He was treasurer of Lincoln's Inn in 1883, and vice-president of\r\nthe council of legal education. He was also a fellow of the Royal\r\nSociety. Jessel's career marks an epoch on the bench, owing to the\r\nactive part taken by him in rendering the Judicature Acts effective, and\r\nalso because he was the last judge capable of sitting in the House of\r\nCommons, a privilege of which he did not avail himself. He was the first\r\nJew who, as solicitor-general, took a share in the executive government\r\nof his country, the first Jew who was sworn a regular member of the\r\nprivy council, and the first Jew who took a seat on the judicial bench\r\nof Great Britain; he was also, for many years after being called to the\r\nbar, so situated that any one might have driven him from it, because,\r\nbeing a Jew, he was not qualified to be a member of the bar. In person\r\nJessel was a stoutish, square-built man of middle height, with dark\r\nhair, somewhat heavy features, a fresh ruddy complexion, and a large\r\nmouth. He married in 1856 Amelia, daughter of Joseph Moses, who survived\r\nhim together with three daughters and two sons, the elder of whom,\r\nCharles James (b. 1860), was made a baronet shortly after the death of\r\nhis distinguished father and in recognition of his services.\r\n\r\n  See _The Times_, March 23, 1883; E. Manson, _Builders of our Law_\r\n  (1904).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJESSORE, a town and district of British India, in the Presidency\r\ndivision of Bengal. The town is on the Bhairab river, with a railway\r\nstation 75 m. N.E. of Calcutta. Pop. (1901), 8054.\r\n\r\nThe DISTRICT OF JESSORE has an area of 2925 sq. m. Pop. (1901),\r\n1,813,155, showing a decrease of 4% in the decade. The district forms\r\nthe central portion of the delta between the Hugli and the united Ganges\r\nand Brahmaputra. It is a vast alluvial plain intersected by rivers and\r\nwatercourses, which in the southern portion spread out into large\r\nmarshes. The northern part is verdant, with extensive groves of\r\ndate-palms; villages are numerous and large; and the people are\r\nprosperous. In the central portion the population is sparse, the only\r\npart suitable for dwellings being the high land on the banks of rivers.\r\nThe principal rivers are the Madhumati or Haringhata (which forms the\r\neastern boundary of the district), with its tributaries the Nabaganga,\r\nChitra, and Bhairab; the Kumar, Kabadak, Katki, Harihar, Bhadra and\r\nAtharabanka. Within the last century the rivers in the interior of\r\nJessore have ceased to be true deltaic rivers; and, whereas the northern\r\nportion of the district formerly lay under water for several months\r\nevery year, it is now reached only by unusual inundations. The tide\r\nreaches as far north as the latitude of Jessore town. Jessore is the\r\ncentre of sugar manufacture from date palms. The exports are sugar,\r\nrice, pulse, timber, honey, shells, &c.; the imports are salt, English\r\ngoods, and cloth. The district is crossed by the Eastern Bengal railway,\r\nbut the chief means of communication are waterways.\r\n\r\nBritish administration was completely established in the district in\r\n1781, when the governor-general ordered the opening of a court at Murali\r\nnear Jessore. Before that, however, the fiscal administration had been\r\nin the hands of the English, having been transferred to the East India\r\ncompany with that of the rest of Bengal in 1765. The changes in\r\njurisdiction in Jessore have been very numerous. After many transfers\r\nand rectifications, the district was in 1863 finally constituted as it\r\nat present stands. The rajas of Jessore or Chanchra trace their origin\r\nto Bhabeswar Rai, a soldier in the army of Khan-i-Azam, an imperial\r\ngeneral, who deprived Raja Pratapaditya, the popular hero of the\r\nSundarbans, of several fiscal divisions, and conferred them on\r\nBhabeswar. But Manohar Rai (1649-1705) is regarded as the principal\r\nfounder of the family. The estate when he inherited it was of moderate\r\nsize, but he acquired one _pargana_ after another, until, at his death,\r\nthe property was by far the largest in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJESTER, a provider of \"jests\" or amusements, a buffoon, especially a\r\nprofessional fool at a royal court or in a nobleman's household (see\r\nFOOL). The word \"jest,\" from which \"jester\" is formed, is used from the\r\n16th century for the earlier \"gest,\" Lat. _gesta_, or _res gestae_,\r\nthings done, from _gerere_, to do, hence deeds, exploits, especially as\r\ntold in history, and so used of the metrical and prose romances and\r\nchronicles of the middle ages. The word became applied to satirical\r\nwritings and to any long-winded empty tale, and thence to a joke or\r\npiece of fun, the current meaning of the word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJESUATI, a religious order founded by Giovanni Colombini of Siena in\r\n1360. Colombini had been a prosperous merchant and a senator in his\r\nnative city, but, coming under ecstatic religious influences, abandoned\r\nsecular affairs and his wife and daughter (after making provision for\r\nthem), and with a friend of like temperament, Francesco Miani, gave\r\nhimself to a life of apostolic poverty, penitential discipline, hospital\r\nservice and public preaching. The name Jesuati was given to Colombini\r\nand his disciples from the habit of calling loudly on the name of Jesus\r\nat the beginning and end of their ecstatic sermons. The senate banished\r\nColombini from Siena for imparting foolish ideas to the young men of the\r\ncity, and he continued his mission in Arezzo and other places, only to\r\nbe honourably recalled home on the outbreak of a devastating pestilence.\r\nHe went out to meet Urban V. on his return from Avignon to Rome in 1367,\r\nand craved his sanction for the new order and a distinctive habit.\r\nBefore this was granted Colombini had to clear the movement of a\r\nsuspicion that it was connected with the heretical sect of Fraticelli,\r\nand he died on the 31st of July 1367, soon after the papal approval had\r\nbeen given. The guidance of the new order, whose members (all lay\r\nbrothers) gave themselves entirely to works of mercy, devolved upon\r\nMiani. Their rule of life, originally a compound of Benedictine and\r\nFranciscan elements, was later modified on Augustinian lines, but traces\r\nof the early penitential idea persisted, e.g. the wearing of sandals and\r\na daily flagellation. Paul V. in 1606 arranged for a small proportion of\r\nclerical members, and later in the 17th century the Jesuati became so\r\nsecularized that the members were known as the Aquavitae Fathers, and\r\nthe order was dissolved by Clement IX. in 1668. The female branch of the\r\norder, the Jesuati sisters, founded by Caterina Colombini (d. 1387) in\r\nSiena, and thence widely dispersed, more consistently maintained the\r\nprimitive strictness of the society and survived the male branch by 200\r\nyears, existing until 1872 in small communities in Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJESUITS, the name generally given to the members of the Society of\r\nJesus, a religious order in the Roman Catholic Church, founded in 1539.\r\nThis Society may be defined, in its original conception and well-avowed\r\nobject, as a body of highly trained religious men of various degrees,\r\nbound by the three personal vows of poverty, chastity and obedience,\r\ntogether with, in some cases, a special vow to the pope's service, with\r\nthe object of labouring for the spiritual good of themselves and their\r\nneighbours. They are declared to be mendicants and enjoy all the\r\nprivileges of the other mendicant orders. They are governed and live by\r\nconstitutions and rules, mostly drawn up by their founder, St Ignatius\r\nof Loyola, and approved by the popes. Their proper title is \"Clerks\r\nRegulars of the Society of Jesus,\" the word _Societas_ being taken as\r\nsynonymous with the original Spanish term, _Compañia_; perhaps the\r\nmilitary term _Cohors_ might more fully have expressed the original idea\r\nof a band of spiritual soldiers living under martial law and discipline.\r\nThe ordinary term \"Jesuit\" was given to the Society by its avowed\r\nopponents; it is first found in the writings of Calvin and in the\r\nregisters of the Parlement of Paris as early as 1552.\r\n\r\n_Constitution and Character._--The formation of the Society was a\r\nmasterpiece of genius on the part of a man (see LOYOLA) who was quick to\r\nrealize the necessity of the moment. Just before Ignatius was\r\nexperiencing the call to conversion, Luther had begun his revolt against\r\nthe Roman Church by burning the papal bull of excommunication on the\r\n10th of December 1520. But while Luther's most formidable opponent was\r\nthus being prepared in Spain, the actual formation of the Society was\r\nnot to take place for eighteen years. Its conception seems to have\r\ndeveloped very slowly in the mind of Ignatius. It introduced a new idea\r\ninto the Church. Hitherto all regulars made a point of the choral office\r\nin choir. But as Ignatius conceived the Church to be in a state of war,\r\nwhat was desirable in days of peace ceased when the life of the cloister\r\nhad to be exchanged for the discipline of the camp; so in the sketch of\r\nthe new society which he laid before Paul III., Ignatius laid down the\r\nprinciple that the obligation of the breviary should be fulfilled\r\nprivately and separately and not in choir. The other orders, too, were\r\nbound by the idea of a constitutional monarchy based on the democratic\r\nspirit. Not so with the Society. The founder placed the general for life\r\nin an almost uncontrolled position of authority, giving him the faculty\r\nof dispensing individuals from the decrees of the highest legislative\r\nbody, the general congregations. Thus the principle of military\r\nobedience was exalted to a degree higher than that existing in the older\r\norders, which preserved to their members certain constitutional rights.\r\n\r\n  The soldier-mind of Ignatius can be seen throughout the constitutions.\r\n  Even in the spiritual labours which the Society shares with the other\r\n  orders, its own ways of dealing with persons and things result from\r\n  the system of training which succeeds in forming men to a type that is\r\n  considered desirable. But it must not be thought that in practice the\r\n  rule of the Society and the high degree of obedience demanded result\r\n  in mere mechanism. By a system of check and counter check devised in\r\n  the constitutions the power of local superiors is modified, so that in\r\n  practice the working is smooth. Ignatius knew that while a high ideal\r\n  was necessary for every society, his followers were flesh and blood,\r\n  not machines. He made it clear from the first that the Society was\r\n  everything and the individual nothing, except so far as he might prove\r\n  a useful instrument for carrying out the Society's objects. Ignatius\r\n  said to his secretary Polanco that \"in those who offered themselves\r\n  he looked less to purely natural goodness than to firmness of\r\n  character and ability for business, for he was of opinion that those\r\n  who were not fit for public business were not adapted for filling\r\n  offices in the Society.\" He further declared that even exceptional\r\n  qualities and endowments in a candidate were valuable in his eyes only\r\n  on the condition of their being brought into play, or held in\r\n  abeyance, strictly at the command of a superior. Hence his teaching on\r\n  obedience. His letter on this subject, addressed to the Jesuits of\r\n  Coimbra in 1553, is still one of the standard formularies of the\r\n  Society, ranking with those other products of his pen, the _Spiritual\r\n  Exercises_ and the _Constitutions_. In this letter Ignatius clothes\r\n  the general with the powers of a commander-in-chief in time of war,\r\n  giving him the absolute disposal of all members of the Society in\r\n  every place and for every purpose. He pushes the claim even further,\r\n  requiring, besides entire outward submission to command, also the\r\n  complete identification of the inferior's will with that of the\r\n  superior. He lays down that the superior is to be obeyed simply as\r\n  such and as standing in the place of God, without reference to his\r\n  personal wisdom, piety or discretion; that any obedience which falls\r\n  short of making the superior's will one's own, in inward affection as\r\n  well as in outward effect, is lax and imperfect; that going beyond the\r\n  letter of command, even in things abstractly good and praiseworthy, is\r\n  disobedience, and that the \"sacrifice of the intellect\" is the third\r\n  and highest grade of obedience, well pleasing to God, when the\r\n  inferior not only wills what the superior wills, but thinks what he\r\n  thinks, submitting his judgment, so far as it is possible for the will\r\n  to influence and lead the judgment. This _Letter on Obedience_ was\r\n  written for the guidance and formation of Ignatius's own followers; it\r\n  was an entirely domestic affair. But when it became known beyond the\r\n  Society the teaching met with great opposition, especially from\r\n  members of other orders whose institutes represented the normal days\r\n  of peace rather than those of war. The letter was condemned by the\r\n  Inquisitions of Spain and Portugal; and it tasked all the skill and\r\n  learning of Bellarmine as its apologist, together with the whole\r\n  influence of the Society, to avert what seemed to be a probable\r\n  condemnation at Rome.\r\n\r\n  The teaching of the _Letter_ must be understood in the living spirit\r\n  of the Society. Ignatius himself lays down the rule that an inferior\r\n  is bound to make all necessary representations to his superior so as\r\n  to guide him in imposing a precept of obedience. When a superior knows\r\n  the views of his inferior and still commands, it is because he is\r\n  aware of other sides of the question which appear of greater\r\n  importance than those that the inferior has brought forward. Ignatius\r\n  distinctly excepts the case where obedience in itself would be sinful:\r\n  \"In all things _except sin_ I ought to do the will of my superior and\r\n  not my own.\" There may be cases where an inferior judges that what is\r\n  commanded is sinful. What is to be done? Ignatius says: \"When it seems\r\n  to me that I am commanded by my superior to do a thing against which\r\n  my conscience revolts as sinful and my superior judges otherwise, it\r\n  is my duty to yield my doubts to him unless I am otherwise constrained\r\n  by evident reasons. ... If submissions do not appease my conscience I\r\n  must impart my doubts to two or three persons of discretion and abide\r\n  by their decision.\" From this it is clear that only in _doubtful_\r\n  cases concerning sin should an inferior try to submit his judgment to\r\n  that of his superior, who _ex officio_ is held to be not only one who\r\n  would not order what is clearly sinful, but also a competent judge who\r\n  knows and understands, better than the inferior, the nature and aspect\r\n  of the command. As the Jesuit obedience is based on the law of God, it\r\n  is clearly impossible that he should be bound to obey in what is\r\n  directly opposed to the divine service. A Jesuit lives in obedience\r\n  all his life, though the yoke is not galling nor always felt. He can\r\n  accept no dignity or office which will make him independent of the\r\n  Society; and even if ordered by the pope to accept the cardinalate or\r\n  the episcopate, he is still bound, if not to obey, yet to listen to\r\n  the advice of those whom the general deputes to counsel him in\r\n  important matters.\r\n\r\n  The Jesuits had to find their principal work in the world and in\r\n  direct and immediate contact with mankind. To seek spiritual\r\n  perfection in a retired life of contemplation and prayer did not seem\r\n  to Ignatius to be the best way of reforming the evils which had\r\n  brought about the revolt from Rome. He withdrew his followers from\r\n  this sort of retirement, except as a mere temporary preparation for\r\n  later activity; he made habitual intercourse with the world a prime\r\n  duty; and to this end he rigidly suppressed all such external\r\n  peculiarities of dress or rule as tended to put obstacles in the way\r\n  of his followers acting freely as emissaries, agents or missionaries\r\n  in the most various places and circumstances. Another change he\r\n  introduced even more completely than did the founders of the Friars.\r\n  The Jesuit has no home: the whole world is his parish. Mobility and\r\n  cosmopolitanism are of the very essence of the Society. As Ignatius\r\n  said, the ancient monastic communities were the infantry of the\r\n  Church, whose duty was to stand firmly in one place on the\r\n  battlefield; the Jesuits were to be her light horse, capable of going\r\n  anywhere at a moment's notice, but especially apt and designed for\r\n  scouting and skirmishing. To carry out this view, it was one of his\r\n  plans to send foreigners as superiors or officers to the Jesuit houses\r\n  in each country, requiring of these envoys, however, invariably to use\r\n  the language of their new place of residence and to study it both in\r\n  speaking and writing till entire mastery of it had been acquired--thus\r\n  by degrees making all the parts of his system mutually\r\n  interchangeable, and so largely increasing the number of persons\r\n  eligible to fill any given post without reference to locality. But\r\n  subsequent experience has, in practice, modified this interchange, as\r\n  far as local government goes, though the central government of the\r\n  Society is always cosmopolitan.\r\n\r\nNext we must consider the machinery by which the Society is constituted\r\nand governed so as to make its spirit a living energy and not a mere\r\nabstract theory. The Society is distributed into six grades: novices,\r\nscholastics, temporal coadjutors (lay brothers), spiritual coadjutors,\r\nprofessed of the three vows, and professed of the four vows. No one can\r\nbecome a postulant for admission to the Society until fourteen years\r\nold, unless by special dispensation. The novice is classified according\r\nas his destination is the priesthood or lay brotherhood, while a third\r\nclass of \"indifferents\" receives such as are reserved for further\r\ninquiry before a decision of this kind is made. The novice has first to\r\nundergo a strict retreat, practically in solitary confinement, during\r\nwhich he receives from a director the _Spiritual Exercises_ and makes a\r\ngeneral confession of his whole life; after which the first novitiate of\r\ntwo years' duration begins. In this period of trial the real character\r\nof the man is discerned, his weak points are noted and his will is\r\ntested. Prayer and the practices of asceticism, as means to an end, are\r\nthe chief occupations of the novice. He may leave or be dismissed at any\r\ntime during the two years; but at the end of the period if he is\r\napproved and destined for the priesthood, he is advanced to the grade of\r\nscholastic and takes the following simple vows in the presence of\r\ncertain witnesses, but not to any person:--\r\n\r\n  \"Almighty Everlasting God, albeit everyway most unworthy in Thy holy\r\n  sight, yet relying on Thine infinite kindness and mercy and impelled\r\n  by the desire of serving Thee, before the Most Holy Virgin Mary and\r\n  all Thy heavenly host, I, N., vow to Thy divine Majesty Poverty,\r\n  Chastity and Perpetual Obedience to the Society of Jesus, and promise\r\n  that I will enter the same Society to live in it perpetually,\r\n  understanding all things according to the Constitutions of the\r\n  Society. I humbly pray from Thine immense goodness and clemency,\r\n  through the Blood of Jesus Christ, that Thou wilt deign to accept this\r\n  sacrifice in the odour of sweetness; and as Thou hast granted me to\r\n  desire and to offer this, so wilt Thou bestow abundant grace to fulfil\r\n  it.\"\r\n\r\nThe scholastic then follows the ordinary course of an undergraduate at a\r\nuniversity. After passing five years in arts he has, while still keeping\r\nup his own studies, to devote five or six years more to teaching the\r\njunior classes in various Jesuit schools or colleges. About this period\r\nhe takes his simple vows in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n  \"I, _N._, promise to Almighty God, before His Virgin Mother and the\r\n  whole heavenly host, and to thee, Reverend Father General of the\r\n  Society of Jesus, holding the place of God, and to thy successors (or\r\n  to thee, Reverend Father _M._ in place of the General of the Society\r\n  of Jesus and his successors holding the place of God), Perpetual\r\n  Poverty, Chastity and Obedience; and according to it a peculiar care\r\n  in the education of boys, according to the manner expressed in the\r\n  Apostolic Letter and Constitutions of the said Society.\"\r\n\r\nThe lay brothers leave out the clause concerning education. The\r\nscholastic does not begin the study of theology until he is twenty-eight\r\nor thirty, and then passes through a four or six years' course. Only\r\nwhen he is thirty-four or thirty-six can he be ordained a priest and\r\nenter on the grade of a spiritual coadjutor. A lay brother, before he\r\ncan become a temporal coadjutor for the discharge of domestic duties,\r\nmust pass ten years before he is admitted to vows. Sometimes after\r\nordination the priest, in the midst of his work, is again called away to\r\na third year's novitiate, called the tertianship, as a preparation for\r\nhis solemn profession of the three vows. His former vows were simple and\r\nthe Society was at liberty to dismiss him for any canonical reason. The\r\nformula of the famous Jesuit vow is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  \"I, _N._, promise to Almighty God, before His Virgin Mother and the\r\n  whole heavenly host, and to all standing by; and to thee, Reverend\r\n  Father General of the Society of Jesus, holding the place of God, and\r\n  to thy successors (or to thee, Reverend Father _M._ in place of the\r\n  General of the Society of Jesus and his successors holding the place\r\n  of God), Perpetual Poverty, Chastity and Obedience; and according to\r\n  it a peculiar care in the education of boys according to the form of\r\n  life contained in the Apostolic Letters of the Society of Jesus and in\r\n  its Constitutions.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately after the vows the Jesuit adds the following simple vows:\r\n(1) that he will never act nor consent that the provisions in the\r\nconstitutions concerning poverty should be changed; (2) that he will not\r\ndirectly nor indirectly procure election or promotion for himself to any\r\nprelacy or dignity in the Society; (3) that he will not accept or\r\nconsent to his election to any dignity or prelacy outside the Society\r\nunless forced thereunto by obedience; (4) that if he knows of others\r\ndoing these things he will denounce them to the superiors; (5) that if\r\nelected to a bishopric he will never refuse to hear such advice as the\r\ngeneral may deign to send him and will follow it if he judges it is\r\nbetter than his own opinion. The professed is now eligible to certain\r\noffices in the Society, and he may remain as a professed father of the\r\nthree vows for the rest of his life. The highest class, who constitute\r\nthe real core of the Society, whence all its chief officers are taken,\r\nare the professed of the four vows. This grade can seldom be reached\r\nuntil the candidate is in his forty-fifth year, which involves a\r\nprobation of thirty-one years in the case of those who have entered on\r\nthe novitiate at the earliest legal age. The number of these select\r\nmembers is small in comparison with the whole Society; the exact\r\nproportion varies from time to time, the present tendency being to\r\nincrease the number. The vows of this grade are the same as the last\r\nformula, with the addition of the following important clause:--\r\n\r\n  \"Moreover I promise the special obedience to the Sovereign Pontiff\r\n  concerning missions, as is contained in the same Apostolic Letter and\r\n  Constitutions.\"\r\n\r\nThese various members of the Society are distributed in its novitiate\r\nhouses, its colleges, its professed houses and its mission residences.\r\nThe question has been hotly debated whether, in addition to these six\r\ngrades, there be not a seventh answering in some degree to the\r\ntertiaries of the Franciscan and Dominican orders, but secretly\r\naffiliated to the Society and acting as its emissaries in various lay\r\npositions. This class was styled in France \"Jesuits of the short robe,\"\r\nand there is some evidence in support of its actual existence under\r\nLouis XV. The Jesuits themselves deny the existence of any such body,\r\nand are able to adduce the negative disproof that no provision for it is\r\nto be found in their constitutions. On the other hand there are clauses\r\ntherein which make the creation of such a class perfectly feasible if\r\nthought expedient. An admitted instance is the case of Francisco Borgia,\r\nwho in 1548, while still duke of Gandia, was received into the Society.\r\nWhat has given colour to the idea is that certain persons have made vows\r\nof obedience to individual Jesuits; as Thomas Worthington, rector of the\r\nDouai seminary, to Father Robert Parsons; Ann Vaux to Fr. Henry Garnet,\r\nwho told her that he was not indeed allowed to receive her vows, but\r\nthat she might make them if she wished and then receive his direction.\r\nThe archaeologist George Oliver of Exeter was, according to Foley's\r\n_Records of the English Province_, the last of the secular priests of\r\nEngland who vowed obedience to the Society before its suppression.\r\n\r\nThe general lives permanently at Rome and holds in his hands the right\r\nto appoint, not only to the office of provincial over each of the head\r\ndistricts into which the Society is mapped, but to the offices of each\r\nhouse in particular. There is no standard of electoral right in the\r\nSociety except in the election of the general himself. By a minute and\r\nfrequent system of official and private reports he is informed of the\r\ndoings and progress of every member of the Society and of everything\r\nthat concerns it throughout the world. Every Jesuit has not only the\r\nright but the duty in certain cases of communicating, directly and\r\nprivately, with his general. While the general thus controls everything,\r\nhe himself is not exempt from supervision on the part of the Society. A\r\nconsultative council is imposed upon him by the general congregation,\r\nconsisting of the assistants of the various nations, a _socius_, or\r\nadviser, to warn him of mistakes, and a confessor. These he cannot\r\nremove nor select; and he is bound, in certain circumstances, to listen\r\nto their advice, although he is not obliged to follow it. Once elected\r\nthe general may not refuse the office, nor abdicate, nor accept any\r\ndignity or office outside of the Society; on the other hand, for certain\r\ndefinite reasons, he may be suspended or even deposed by the authority\r\nof the Society, which can thus preserve itself from destruction. No such\r\ninstance has occurred, although steps were once taken in this direction\r\nin the case of a general who had set himself against the current\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\n  It is said that the general of the Jesuits is independent of the pope;\r\n  and his popular name, \"the black pope,\" has gone to confirm this idea.\r\n  But it is based on an entirely wrong conception of the two offices.\r\n  The suppression of the Society by Clement XIV. in 1773 was an\r\n  object-lesson in the supremacy of the pope. The Society became very\r\n  numerous and, from time to time, received extraordinary privileges\r\n  from popes, who were warranted by the necessities of the times in\r\n  granting them. A great number of influential friends, also, gathered\r\n  round the fathers who, naturally, sought in every way to retain what\r\n  had been granted. Popes who thought it well to bring about certain\r\n  changes, or to withdraw privileges that were found to have passed\r\n  their intentions or to interfere unduly with the rights of other\r\n  bodies, often met with loyal resistances against their proposed\r\n  measures. Resistance up to a certain point is lawful and is not\r\n  disobedience, for every society has the right of self-preservation. In\r\n  cases where the popes insisted, in spite of the representations of the\r\n  Jesuits, their commands were obeyed. Many of the popes were distinctly\r\n  unfavourable to the Society, while others were as friendly, and often\r\n  what one pope did against them the next pope withdrew. Whatever was\r\n  done in times when strong divergence of opinion existed, and whatever\r\n  may have been the actions of individuals who, even in so highly\r\n  organized a body as the Society of Jesus, cannot always be\r\n  successfully controlled by their superiors, yet the ultimate result on\r\n  the part of the Society has always been obedience to the pope, who\r\n  authorized, protected and privileged them, and on whom they ultimately\r\n  depend for their very existence.\r\n\r\nThus constituted, with a skilful union of strictness and freedom, of\r\ncomplex organization with a minimum of friction in working, the Society\r\nwas admirably devised for its purpose of introducing a new power into\r\nthe Church and the world. Its immediate services to the Church were\r\ngreat. The Society did much, single-handed, to roll back the tide of\r\nProtestant advance when half of Europe, which had not already shaken off\r\nits allegiance to the papacy, was threatening to do so. The honours of\r\nthe reaction belong to the Jesuits, and the reactionary spirit has\r\nbecome their tradition. They had the wisdom to see and to admit, in\r\ntheir correspondence with their superiors, that the real cause of the\r\nReformation was the ignorance, neglect and vicious lives of so many\r\npriests. They recognized, as most earnest men did, that the difficulty\r\nwas in the higher places, and that these could best be touched by\r\nindirect methods. At a time when primary or even secondary education had\r\nin most places become a mere effete and pedantic adherence to obsolete\r\nmethods, they were bold enough to innovate, both in system and material.\r\nPutting fresh spirit and devotion into the work, they not merely taught\r\nand catechized in a new, fresh and attractive manner, besides\r\nestablishing free schools of good quality, but provided new school books\r\nfor their pupils which were an enormous advance on those they found in\r\nuse; so that for nearly three centuries the Jesuits were accounted the\r\nbest schoolmasters in Europe, as they were, till their forcible\r\nsuppression in 1901, confessedly the best in France. The Jesuit teachers\r\nconciliated the goodwill of their pupils by mingled firmness and\r\ngentleness. Although the method of the _Ratio Studiorum_ has ceased to\r\nbe acceptable, yet it played in its time as serious a part in the\r\nintellectual development of Europe as did the method of Frederick the\r\nGreat in modern warfare. Bacon succinctly gives his opinion of the\r\nJesuit teaching in these words: \"As for the pedagogical part, the\r\nshortest rule would be, Consult the schools of the Jesuits; for nothing\r\nbetter has been put in practice\" (_De Augmentis_, vi. 4). In instruction\r\nthey were excellent; but in education, or formation of character,\r\ndeficient. Again, when most of the continental clergy had sunk, more or\r\nless, into the moral and intellectual slough which is pictured for us in\r\nthe writings of Erasmus and the _Epistolae obscurorum virorum_ (see\r\nHUTTEN, ULRICH VON), the Jesuits won back respect for the clerical\r\ncalling by their personal culture and the unimpeachable purity of their\r\nlives. These qualities they have carefully maintained; and probably no\r\nlarge body of men in the world has been so free from the reproach of\r\ndiscreditable members or has kept up, on the whole, an equally high\r\naverage of intelligence and conduct. As preachers, too, they delivered\r\nthe pulpit from the bondage of an effete scholasticism and reached at\r\nonce a clearness and simplicity of treatment such as the English pulpit\r\nscarcely begins to exhibit till after the days of Tillotson; while in\r\nliterature and theology they count a far larger number of respectable\r\nwriters than any other religious society can boast. It is in the mission\r\nfield, however, that their achievements have been most remarkable.\r\nWhether toiling among the teeming millions in Hindustan and China,\r\nlabouring amongst the Hurons and Iroquois of North America, governing\r\nand civilizing the natives of Brazil and Paraguay in the missions and\r\n\"reductions,\" or ministering, at the hourly risk of his life to his\r\nfellow-Catholics in England under Elizabeth and the Stuarts, the Jesuit\r\nappears alike devoted, indefatigable, cheerful and worthy of hearty\r\nadmiration and respect.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, two startling and indisputable facts meet the student who\r\npursues the history of the Society. The first is the universal suspicion\r\nand hostility it has incurred--not merely from the Protestants whose\r\navowed foe it has been, not yet from the enemies of all clericalism and\r\ndogma, but from every Catholic state and nation in the world. Its chief\r\nenemies have been those of the household of the Roman Catholic faith.\r\nThe second fact is the ultimate failure which seems to dog all its most\r\npromising schemes and efforts. These two results are to be observed\r\nalike in the provinces of morals and politics. The first cause of the\r\nopposition indeed redounds to the Jesuits' credit, for it was largely\r\ndue to their success. Their pulpits rang with a studied eloquence; their\r\nchurches, sumptuous and attractive, were crowded; and in the\r\nconfessional their advice was eagerly sought in all kinds of\r\ndifficulties, for they were the fashionable professors of the art of\r\ndirection. Full of enthusiasm and zeal, devoted wholly to their Society,\r\nthey were able to bring in numbers of rich and influential persons to\r\ntheir ranks; for, with a clear understanding of the power of wealth,\r\nthey became, of set purpose, the apostles of the rich and influential.\r\nThe Jesuits felt that they were the new men, the men of the time; so\r\nwith a perfect confidence in themselves they went out to set the Church\r\nto rights. It was no wonder that success, so well worked for and so well\r\ndeserved, failed to win the approval or sympathy of those who found\r\nthemselves supplanted. Old-fashioned men, to whom the apostles' advice\r\nto \"do all to the glory of God\" seemed sufficient, mistrusted those who\r\nprofessed to go beyond all others and adopted as their motto the famous\r\n_Ad majorem Dei gloriam_, \"To the greater glory of God.\" But, besides\r\nthis, the _esprit de corps_ which is necessary for every body of men\r\nwas, it was held, carried to an excess and made the Jesuits intolerant\r\nof any one or anything if not of \"ours.\" The novelties too which they\r\nintroduced into the conception of the religious life, naturally, were\r\ndispleasing to the older orders, who felt like old aristocratic families\r\ntowards a newly rich or purse-proud upstart. The Society, or rather its\r\nmembers, were too aggressive and self-assertive to be welcomed; and a\r\ncertain characteristic, which soon began to manifest itself in an\r\nimpatience of episcopal control, showed that the quality of \"Jesuitry,\"\r\nusually associated with the Society, was singularly lacking in their\r\ndealings with opponents. Their political attitude also alienated many.\r\nMany of the Jesuits could not separate religion from politics. To say\r\nthis is only to assert that they were not clearer-minded than most men\r\nof their age. But unfortunately they invariably took the wrong side and\r\nallowed themselves to be made the tools of men who saw farther and more\r\nclearly than they did. They had their share, direct or indirect, in the\r\nembroiling of states, in concocting conspiracies and in kindling wars.\r\nThey were also responsible by their theoretical teachings in theological\r\nschools, where cases were considered and treated in the abstract, for\r\nnot a few assassinations of the enemies of the cause. Weak minds heard\r\ntyrannicide discussed and defended in the abstract; and it was no\r\nwonder that, when opportunity served, the train that had been heedlessly\r\nlaid by speculative professors was fired by rash hands. What professors\r\nlike Suarez taught in the calm atmosphere of the lecture hall, what\r\nwriters like Mariana upheld and praised, practical men took as\r\njustification for deeds of blood. There is no evidence that any Jesuit\r\ntook a direct part in political assassinations; however, indirectly,\r\nthey may have been morally responsible. They were playing with edged\r\ntools and often got wounded through their own carelessness. Other\r\ngrievances were raised by their perpetual meddling in politics, e.g.\r\ntheir large share in fanning the flames of political hatred against the\r\nHuguenots under the last two Valois kings; their perpetual plotting\r\nagainst England in the reign of Elizabeth; their share in the Thirty\r\nYears' War and in the religious miseries of Bohemia; their decisive\r\ninfluence in causing the revocation of the edict of Nantes and the\r\nexpulsion of the Protestants from France; the ruin of the Stuart cause\r\nunder James II., and the establishment of the Protestant succession. In\r\na number of cases where the evidence against them is defective, it is at\r\nleast an unfortunate coincidence that there is always direct proof of\r\nsome Jesuit having been in communication with the actual agents engaged.\r\nThey were the stormy petrels of politics. Yet the Jesuits, as a body,\r\nshould not be made responsible for the doings of men who, in their\r\npolitical intrigues, were going directly against the distinct law of the\r\nSociety, which in strict terms, and under heavy penalties, forbade them\r\nto have anything to do with such matters. The politicians were\r\ncomparatively few in number, though unfortunately they held high rank;\r\nand their disobedience to the rule besmirched the name of the society\r\nand destroyed the good work of the other Jesuits who were faithfully\r\ncarrying out their own proper duties.\r\n\r\nA far graver cause for uneasiness was given by the Jesuits' activity in\r\nthe region of doctrine and morals. Here the charges against them are\r\nprecise, early, numerous and weighty. Their founder himself was\r\narrested, more than once, by the Inquisition and required to give\r\naccount of his belief and conduct. But St Ignatius, with all his\r\npowerful gifts of intellect, was entirely practical and ethical in his\r\nrange, and had no turn whatever for speculation, nor desire to discuss,\r\nmuch less to question, any of the received dogmas of the Church. He\r\ngives it as a rule of orthodoxy to be ready to say that black is white\r\nif the Church says so. He was therefore acquitted on every occasion, and\r\napplied each time for a formally attested certificate of his orthodoxy,\r\nknowing well that, in default of such documents, the fact of his arrest\r\nas a suspected heretic would be more distinctly recollected by opponents\r\nthan that of his honourable dismissal from custody. His followers,\r\nhowever, have not been so fortunate. On doctrinal questions indeed,\r\nthough their teaching on grace, especially in the form given to it by\r\nMolina (q.v.), ran contrary to the accepted teaching on the subject by\r\nthe Augustinians, Dominicans and other representative schools; yet by\r\ntheir pertinacity they gained for their views a recognized and\r\nestablished position. A special congregation of cardinals and\r\ntheologians known as _de auxiliis_ was summoned by the pope to settle\r\nthe dispute, for the _odium theologicum_ had risen to a desperate height\r\nbetween the representatives of the old and the new theology; but after\r\nmany years they failed to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion, and the\r\npope, instead of settling the dispute, was only able to impose mutual\r\nsilence on all opponents. Among those who held out stiffly against the\r\nJesuits on the subject of grace were the Jansenists, who held that they\r\nwere following the special teaching of St Augustine, known _par\r\nexcellence_ as the doctor of grace. The Jesuits and the Jansenists soon\r\nbecame deadly enemies; and in the ensuing conflict both parties accused\r\neach other of flinging scruples to the wind. (See JANSENISM.)\r\n\r\nBut the accusations against the Jesuit system of moral theology and\r\ntheir action as guides of conduct have had a more serious effect on\r\ntheir reputation. It is undeniable that some of their moral writers were\r\nlax in their teaching; and conscience was strained to the snapping\r\npoint. The Society was trying to make itself all things to all men.\r\nPropositions extracted from Jesuit moral theologians have again and\r\nagain been condemned by the pope and declared untenable. Many of these\r\ncan be found in Viva's _Condemned Propositions_. As early as 1554 the\r\nJesuits were censured by the Sorbonne, chiefly at the instance of\r\nEustache de Bellay, bishop of Paris, as being dangerous in matters of\r\nfaith. Melchor Cano, a Dominican, one of the ablest divines of the 16th\r\ncentury, never ceased to lift up his testimony against them, from their\r\nfirst beginnings till his own death in 1560; and, unmollified by the\r\nbribe of the bishopric of the Canaries, which their interest procured\r\nfor him, he succeeded in banishing them from the university of\r\nSalamanca. Carlo Borromeo, to whose original advocacy they owed much,\r\nespecially in the council of Trent, found himself attacked in his own\r\ncathedral pulpit and interfered with in his jurisdiction. He withdrew\r\nhis protection and expelled them from his colleges and churches; and he\r\nwas followed in 1604 in this policy by his cousin and successor Cardinal\r\nFederigo Borromeo. St Theresa learnt, in after years, to mistrust their\r\nmethods, although she was grateful to them for much assistance in the\r\nfirst years of her work. The credit of the Society was seriously damaged\r\nby the publication, at Cracow, in 1612, of the _Monita Secreta_. This\r\nbook, which is undoubtedly a forgery, professes to contain the\r\nauthoritative secret instructions drawn up by the general Acquaviva and\r\ngiven by the superiors of the Society to its various officers and\r\nmembers. A bold caricature of Jesuit methods, the book has been ascribed\r\nto John Zaorowsky or to Cambilone and Schloss, all ex-Jesuits, and it is\r\nstated to have been discovered in manuscript by Christian of Brunswick\r\nin the Jesuit college at Prague. It consists of suggestions and methods\r\nfor extending the influence of the Jesuits in various ways, for securing\r\na footing in fresh places, for acquiring wealth, for creeping into\r\nhouseholds and leading silly rich widows captive and so forth, all\r\nmarked with ambition, craft and unscrupulousness. It had a wide success\r\nand popularity, passing through several editions, and even to this day\r\nit is used by controversialists as unscrupulous as the original writers.\r\nIt may, perhaps, represent the actions of some individuals who allowed\r\ntheir zeal to outrun their discretion, but surely no society which\r\nexists for good and is marked by so many worthy men could systematically\r\nhave conducted its operations in such a manner. Later on a formidable\r\nassault was made on Jesuit moral theology in the famous _Provincial\r\nLetters_ of Blaise Pascal (q.v.), eighteen in number, issued under the\r\npen-name of Louis de Montalte, from January 1656 to March 1657. Their\r\nwit, irony, eloquence and finished style have kept them alive as one of\r\nthe great French classics--a destiny more fortunate than that of the\r\nkindred works by Antoine Arnauld, _Théologie morale des Jésuites_,\r\nconsisting of extracts from writings of members of the Society, and\r\n_Morale pratique des Jésuites_, made up of narratives professing to set\r\nforth the manner in which they carried out their own maxims. But, like\r\nmost controversial writers, the authors were not scrupulous in their\r\nquotations, and by giving passages divorced from their contexts often\r\nentirely misrepresented their opponents. The immediate reply on the part\r\nof the Jesuits, _The Discourses of Cleander and Eudoxus_ by Père Daniel,\r\ncould not compete with Pascal's work in brilliancy, wit or style;\r\nmoreover, it was unfortunate enough to be put upon the Index of\r\nprohibited books in 1701. The reply on behalf of the Society to Pascal's\r\ncharges of lax morality, apart from mere general denials, is broadly as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  (1) St Ignatius himself, the founder of the Society, had a special\r\n  aversion from untruthfulness in all its forms, from quibbling,\r\n  equivocation or even studied obscurity of language, and it would be\r\n  contrary to the spirit of conformity with his example and institutions\r\n  for his followers to think and act otherwise. Hence, any who practised\r\n  equivocation were, so far, unfaithful to the Society. (2) Several of\r\n  the cases cited by Pascal are mere abstract hypotheses, many of them\r\n  now obsolete, argued simply as intellectual exercises, but having no\r\n  practical bearing whatever. (3) Even such as do belong to the sphere\r\n  of actual life are of the nature of counsel to spiritual physicians,\r\n  how to deal with exceptional maladies; and were never intended to fix\r\n  the standard of moral obligation for the general public. (4) The\r\n  theory that they were intended for this latter purpose and do\r\n  represent the normal teaching of the Society becomes more untenable in\r\n  exact proportion as this immorality is insisted on, because it is a\r\n  matter of notoriety that the Jesuits themselves have been singularly\r\n  free from personal, as distinguished from corporate, evil repute; and\r\n  no one pretends that the large number of lay-folk whom they have\r\n  educated or influenced exhibit greater moral inferiority than others.\r\n\r\nThe third of these replies is the most cogent as regards Pascal, but the\r\nreal weakness of his attack lies in that nervous dread of appeal to\r\nfirst principles and their logical result which has been the besetting\r\nsnare of Gallicanism. Pascal, at his best, has mistaken the part for the\r\nwhole; he charges to the Society what, at the most, are the doings of\r\nindividuals; and from these he asserts the degeneration of the body from\r\nits original standard; whereas the stronger the life and the more\r\nextensive the natural development, side by side will exist marks of\r\ndegeneration; and a society like the Jesuits has no difficulty in\r\nasserting its life independently of such excrescences or, in time, in\r\nfreeing itself from them.\r\n\r\n  A charge persistently made against the Society is that it teaches that\r\n  the end justifies the means. And the words of Busembaum, whose\r\n  _Medulla theologiae_ has gone through more than fifty editions, are\r\n  quoted in proof. True it is that Busembaum uses these words: _Cui\r\n  licitus est finis etiam licent media_. But on turning to his work (ed.\r\n  Paris 1729, p. 584, or Lib. vi. Tract vi. cap. ii., _De sacramentis_,\r\n  dubium ii.) it will be found that the author is making no universal\r\n  application of an old legal maxim; but is treating of a particular\r\n  subject (concerning certain lawful liberties in the marital relation)\r\n  beyond which his words cannot be forced. The sense in which other\r\n  Jesuit theologians--e.g. Paul Laymann (1575-1635), in his _Theologia\r\n  moralis_ (Munich, 1625), and Ludwig Wagemann (1713-1792), in his\r\n  _Synopsis theologiae moralis_ (Innsbruck, 1762)--quote the axiom is an\r\n  equally harmless piece of common sense. For instance, if it is lawful\r\n  to go on a journey by railway it is lawful to take a ticket. No one\r\n  who put forth that proposition would be thought to mean that it is\r\n  lawful to defraud the company by stealing a ticket; for the _proviso_\r\n  is always to be understood, that the means employed should, in\r\n  themselves, not be bad but good or at least indifferent. So when\r\n  Wagemann says tersely _Finis determinat probitatem actus_ he is\r\n  clearly referring to acts which in themselves are indifferent, i.e.\r\n  indeterminate. For instance: shooting is an indifferent act, neither\r\n  good nor bad in itself. The morality of any specified shooting depends\r\n  upon what is shot, and the circumstances attending that act: shooting\r\n  a man in self-defence is, as a moral act, on an entirely different\r\n  plane to shooting a man in murder. It has never been proved, and never\r\n  can be proved, although the attempt has frequently been made, that the\r\n  Jesuits ever taught the nefarious proposition ascribed to them, which\r\n  would be entirely subversive of all morality. Again, the doctrine of\r\n  probabilism is utterly misunderstood. It is based on an accurate\r\n  conception of law. Law to bind must be clear and definite; if it be\r\n  not so, its obligation ceases and liberty of action remains. No\r\n  probable opinion can stand against a clear and definite law; but when\r\n  a law is doubtful in its application, in certain circumstances, so is\r\n  the obligation of obedience: and as a doubtful law is, for practical\r\n  purposes, no law at all, so it superinduces no obligation. Hence a\r\n  probable opinion is one, founded on reason and held on serious\r\n  grounds, that the law does not apply to certain specified cases; and\r\n  that the law-giver therefore did not intend to bind. It is the\r\n  principle of equity applied to law. In moral matters a probable\r\n  opinion, that is one held on no trivial grounds but by unprejudiced\r\n  and solid thinkers, has no place where the voice of conscience is\r\n  clear, distinct and formed.\r\n\r\nTwo causes have been at work to produce the universal failure of the\r\ngreat Society in all its plans and efforts. First stands its lack of\r\nreally great intellects. It has had its golden age. No society can keep\r\nup to its highest level. Nothing can be wider of the truth than the\r\npopular conception of the ordinary Jesuit as a being of almost\r\nsuperhuman abilities and universal knowledge. The Society, numbering as\r\nit does so many thousands, and with abundant means of devoting men to\r\nspecial branches of study, has, without doubt, produced men of great\r\nintelligence and solid learning. The average member, too, on account of\r\nhis long and systematic training, is always equal and often superior to\r\nthe average member of any other equally large body, besides being\r\ndisciplined by a far more perfect drill. But it takes great men to carry\r\nout great plans; and of really great men, as the outside world knows and\r\njudges, the Society has been markedly barren from almost the first.\r\nApart from its founder and his early companion, St Francis Xavier, there\r\nis none who stands in the very first rank. Laynez and Acquaviva were\r\nable administrators and politicians; the Bollandists (q.v.) were\r\nindustrious workers and have developed a critical spirit from which much\r\ngood can be expected; Francisco Suarez, Leonhard Lessius and Cardinal\r\nFranzelin were some of the leading Jesuit theologians; Cornelius a\r\nLapide (1567-1637) represents their old school of scriptural studies,\r\nwhile their new German writers are the most advanced of all orthodox\r\nhigher critics; the French Louis Bourdaloue (q.v.), the Italian Paolo\r\nSegneri (1624-1694), and the Portuguese Antonio Vieyra (1608-1697)\r\nrepresent their best pulpit orators; while of the many mathematicians\r\nand astronomers produced by the Society Angelo Secchi, Ruggiero Giuseppe\r\nBoscovich and G. B. Beccaria are conspicuous, and in modern times\r\nStephen Joseph Perry (1833-1889), director of the Stonyhurst College\r\nobservatory, took a high rank among men of science. Their boldest and\r\nmost original thinker, Denis Petau, so many years neglected, is now, by\r\ninspiring Cardinal Newman's _Essay on the Development of Christian\r\nDoctrine_, producing a permanent influence over the current of human\r\nthought. The Jesuits have produced no Aquinas, no Anselm, no Bacon, no\r\nRichelieu. Men whom they trained, and who broke loose from their\r\nteaching, Pascal, Descartes, Voltaire, have powerfully affected the\r\nphilosophical and religious beliefs of great masses of mankind; but\r\nrespectable mediocrity is the brand on the long list of Jesuit names in\r\nthe catalogues of Alegambe and De Backer. This is doubtless due in great\r\nmeasure to the destructive process of scooping out the will of the\r\nJesuit novice, to replace it with that of his superior (as a watchmaker\r\nmight fit a new movement into a case), and thereby tending, in most\r\ncases, to annihilate those subtle qualities of individuality and\r\noriginality which are essential to genius. Men of the higher stamp will\r\neither refuse to submit to the process and leave the Society, or run the\r\ndanger of coming forth from the mill with their finest qualities\r\npulverized and useless. In accordance with the spirit of its founder,\r\nwho wished to secure uniformity in the judgment of his followers even in\r\npoints left open by the Church (\"Let us all think the same way, let us\r\nall speak in the same manner if possible\"), the Society has shown itself\r\nto be impatient of those who think or write in a way different from what\r\nis current in its ranks.\r\n\r\n  Nor is this all. The _Ratio Studiorum_, devised by Acquaviva and still\r\n  obligatory in the colleges of the Society, lays down rules which are\r\n  incompatible with all breadth and progress in the higher forms of\r\n  education. True to the anti-speculative and traditional side of the\r\n  founder's mind, it prescribes that, even where religious topics are\r\n  not in question, the teacher is not to permit any novel opinions or\r\n  discussions to be mooted; nor to cite or allow others to cite the\r\n  opinions of an author not of known repute; nor to teach or suffer to\r\n  be taught anything contrary to the prevalent opinions of acknowledged\r\n  doctors current in the schools. Obsolete and false opinions are not to\r\n  be mentioned at all, even for refutation, nor are objections to\r\n  received teaching to be dwelt on at any length. The result is that the\r\n  Jesuit emerges from his schools without any real knowledge of any\r\n  other method of thought than that which his professors have instilled\r\n  into him. The professor of Biblical Literature is always to support\r\n  and defend the Vulgate and can never prefer the marginal readings from\r\n  the Hebrew and Greek. The Septuagint, as far as it is incorrupt, is to\r\n  be held not less authentic than the Vulgate. In philosophy Aristotle\r\n  is always to be followed, and St Thomas Aquinas generally, care being\r\n  taken to speak respectfully of him even when abandoning his opinions,\r\n  though now it is customary for the Jesuit teachers to explain him in\r\n  their own sense. _De vera mente D. Thomas_ is no unfamiliar expression\r\n  in their books. It is not wonderful, under such a method of training,\r\n  fixed as it has been in minute detail for more than three hundred\r\n  years, that highly cultivated commonplaces should be the inevitable\r\n  average result; and that in proportion as Jesuit power has become\r\n  dominant in Christendom, especially in ecclesiastical circles, the\r\n  same doom of intellectual sterility and consequent loss of influence\r\n  with the higher and thoughtful classes, has separated the part from\r\n  the whole. The initial mistake in the formation of character is that\r\n  the Jesuits have aimed at educating lay boys in the same manner as\r\n  they consider advisable for their own novices, for whom obedience and\r\n  direction is the one thing necessary; whereas for lay people the right\r\n  use of liberty and initiative are to be desired.\r\n\r\nThe second cause which has blighted the efforts of the Society is the\r\nlesson, too faithfully learnt and practised, of making its corporate\r\ninterests the first object at all times and in all places. Men were\r\nquick to see that Jesuits did not aim at co-operation with the other\r\nmembers of the Church but directly or indirectly at mastery. The most\r\nbrilliant exception to this rule is found in some of the missions of the\r\nSociety and notably in that of St Francis Xavier (q.v.). But he quitted\r\nEurope in 1541 before the new society, especially under Laynez, had\r\nhardened into its final mould; and he never returned. His work, so far\r\nas can be gathered from contemporary accounts, was not done on true\r\nJesuit lines as they afterwards developed, though the Society has reaped\r\nall the credit; and it is even possible that, had he succeeded the\r\nfounder as general, the institute might not have received that political\r\nand self-seeking turn which Laynez, as second general, gave at the\r\ncritical moment.\r\n\r\n  It would almost seem that careful selection was made of the men of the\r\n  greatest piety and enthusiasm, whose unworldliness made them less apt\r\n  for diplomatic intrigues, to break new ground in the various missions\r\n  where their success would throw lustre on the Society and their\r\n  scruples need never come into play. But such men are not to be found\r\n  easily; and, as they died off, the tendency was to fill their places\r\n  with more ordinary characters, whose aim was to increase the power and\r\n  resources of the body. Hence the condescension to heathen rites in\r\n  Hindustan and China, and the attempted subjugation of the English\r\n  Catholic clergy. The first successes of the Indian mission were\r\n  entirely among the lower classes; but when in Madura, in 1606, Robert\r\n  de Nobili, a nephew of Bellarmine, to win the Brahmins, adopted their\r\n  dress and mode of life--a step sanctioned by Gregory XV. in 1623 and\r\n  by Clement XI. in 1707--the fathers who followed his example pushed\r\n  the new caste-feeling so far as absolutely to refuse the ministrations\r\n  and sacraments to the pariahs, lest the Brahmin converts should take\r\n  offence--an attempt which was reported to Rome and was vainly censured\r\n  by the breves of Innocent X. in 1645, Clement IX. in 1669, Clement\r\n  XII. in 1734 and 1739, and Benedict XIV. in 1745. The Chinese rites,\r\n  assailed with equal unsuccess by one pope after another, were not\r\n  finally put down until 1744 by a bull of Benedict XIV. For Japan,\r\n  where their side of the story is that best known, we have a remarkable\r\n  letter, printed by Lucas Wadding in the _Annales minorum_, addressed\r\n  to Paul V. by Soleto, a Franciscan missionary, who was martyred in\r\n  1624, in which he complains to the pope that the Jesuits\r\n  systematically postponed the spiritual welfare of the native\r\n  Christians to their own convenience and advantage; while as regards\r\n  the test of martyrdom, no such result had followed on their teaching,\r\n  but only on that of the other orders who had undertaken missionary\r\n  work in Japan. Yet soon many Jesuit martyrs in Japan were to shed a\r\n  new glory on the Society (see JAPAN: _Foreign Intercourse_). Again,\r\n  even in Paraguay, the most promising of all Jesuit undertakings, the\r\n  evidence shows that the fathers, though civilizing the Guarani\r\n  population just sufficiently to make them useful and docile servants,\r\n  happier no doubt than they were before or after, stopped there. While\r\n  the mission was begun on the rational principle of governing races\r\n  still in their childhood by methods adapted to that stage in their\r\n  mental development, yet for one hundred and fifty years the\r\n  \"reductions\" were conducted in the same manner, and when the hour of\r\n  trial came the Jesuit civilization fell like a house of cards.\r\n\r\nThese examples are sufficient to explain the final collapse of so many\r\npromising efforts. The individual Jesuit might be, and often was, a\r\nhero, saint and martyr, but the system which he was obliged to\r\nadminister was foredoomed to failure; and the suppression which came in\r\n1773 was the natural result of forces and elements they had set in\r\nantagonism without the power of controlling.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Society since its restoration in 1814 has not been\r\nmarked with greater success than in its previous history. It was natural\r\nafter the restoration that an attempt should be made to pick up again\r\nthe threads that were dropped; but soon they came to realize the truth\r\nof the saying of St Ignatius: \"The Society shall adapt itself to the\r\ntimes and not the times to the Society.\" The political conditions of\r\nEurope have completely changed, and constitutionalism is unfavourable to\r\nthat personal influence which, in former times, the Jesuits were able to\r\nbring to bear upon the heads of states. In Europe they confine\r\nthemselves mainly to educational and ecclesiastical politics, although\r\nboth Germany and France have followed the example of Portugal and\r\nrefuse, on political grounds, to allow them to be in these countries. It\r\nwould appear as though some of the Jesuits had not, even yet, learnt the\r\nlesson that meddling with politics has always been their ruin. The main\r\ncause of any difficulty that may exist to-day with the Society is that\r\nthe Jesuits are true to the teaching of that remarkable panegyric, the\r\n_Imago primi saeculi Societatis_ (probably written by John Tollenarius\r\nin 1640), by identifying the Church with their own body, and being\r\nintolerant of all who will not share this view. Their power is still\r\nlarge in certain sections of the ecclesiastical world, but in secular\r\naffairs it is small. Moreover within the church itself there is a strong\r\nand growing feeling that the interests of Catholicism may necessitate a\r\nsecond and final suppression of the Society. Cardinal Manning, a keen\r\nobserver of times and influences, was wont to say:--\"The work of 1773\r\nwas the work of God: and there is another 1773 coming.\" But, if this\r\ncome, it will be due not to the pressure of secular governments, as in\r\nthe 18th century, but to the action of the Church itself. The very\r\nnations which have cast out the Society have shown no disposition to\r\naccept its own estimate and identify it with the Church; while the\r\nChurch itself is not conscious of depending upon the Society. To the\r\nChurch the Jesuits have been what the Janissaries were to the Ottoman\r\nEmpire, at first its defenders and its champions, but in the end its\r\ntaskmasters.\r\n\r\n_History._--The separate article on Loyola tells of his early years, his\r\nconversion, and his first gathering of companions. It was not until\r\nNovember 1537, when all hope of going to the Holy Land was given up,\r\nthat any outward steps were taken to form these companions into an\r\norganized body. It was on the eve of their going to Rome, for the second\r\ntime, that the fathers met Ignatius at Vicenza and it was determined to\r\nadopt a common rule and, at the suggestion of Ignatius, the name of the\r\nCompany of Jesus. Whatever may have been his private hopes and\r\nintentions, it was not until he, Laynez and Faber (Pierre Lefevre), in\r\nthe name of their companions, were sent to lay their services at the\r\nfeet of the pope that the history of the Society really begins.\r\n\r\n  On their arrival at Rome the three Jesuits were favourably received by\r\n  Paul III., who at once appointed Faber to the chair of scripture and\r\n  Laynez to that of scholastic theology in the university of the\r\n  Sapienza. But they encountered much opposition and were even charged\r\n  with heresy; when this accusation had been disposed of, there were\r\n  still difficulties in the way of starting any new order. Despite the\r\n  approval of Cardinal Contarini and the goodwill of the pope (who is\r\n  said to have exclaimed on perusing the scheme of Ignatius, \"The finger\r\n  of God is here\"), there was a strong and general feeling that the\r\n  regular system had broken down and could not be wisely developed\r\n  farther. Cardinal Guidiccioni, one of the commission of three\r\n  appointed to examine the draft constitution, was known to advocate the\r\n  abolition of all existing orders, save four which were to be\r\n  remodelled and put under strict control. That very year, 1538, a\r\n  commission of cardinals, including Reginald Pole, Contarini, Sadolet,\r\n  Caraffa (afterwards Paul IV.), Fregoso and others, had reported that\r\n  the conventual orders, which they had to deal with, had drifted into\r\n  such a state that they should all be abolished. Not only so, but, when\r\n  greater strictness of rule and of enclosure seemed the most needful\r\n  reforms in communities that had become too secular in tone, the\r\n  proposal of Ignatius, to make it a first principle that the members of\r\n  his institute should mix freely in the world and be as little marked\r\n  off as possible externally from secular clerical life and usages, ran\r\n  counter to all tradition and prejudice, save that Caraffa's then\r\n  recent order of Theatines, which had some analogy with the proposed\r\n  Society, had taken some steps in the same direction.\r\n\r\n  Ignatius and his companions, however, had but little doubt of ultimate\r\n  success, and so bound themselves, on the 15th of April 1539, to obey\r\n  any superior chosen from amongst their body, and added on the 4th of\r\n  May certain other rules, the most important of which was a vow of\r\n  special allegiance to the pope for mission purposes to be taken by all\r\n  the members of the society. But Guidiccioni, on a careful study of the\r\n  papers, changed his mind; it is supposed that the cause of this change\r\n  was in large measure the strong interest in the new scheme exhibited\r\n  by John III., king of Portugal, who instructed his ambassador to press\r\n  it on the pope and to ask Ignatius to send some priests of his Society\r\n  for mission work in Portugal and its Indian possessions. Francis\r\n  Xavier and Simon Rodriguez were sent to the king in March 1540.\r\n  Obstacles being cleared away, Paul III., on the 27th of September\r\n  1540, issued his bull _Regimini militantis ecclesiae_, by which he\r\n  confirmed the new Society (the term \"order\" does not belong to it),\r\n  but limited the members to sixty, a restriction which was removed by\r\n  the same pope in the bull _Injunctum nobis_ of the 14th of March 1543.\r\n  In the former bull, the pope gives the text of the formula submitted\r\n  by Ignatius as the scheme of the proposed society, and in it we get\r\n  the founder's own ideas: \"... This Society, instituted to this special\r\n  end, namely, to offer spiritual consolation for the advancement of\r\n  souls in life and Christian doctrine, for the propagation of the faith\r\n  by public preaching and the ministry of the word of God, spiritual\r\n  exercises and works of charity and, especially, by the instruction of\r\n  children and ignorant people in Christianity, and by the spiritual\r\n  consolation of the faithful in Christ in hearing confessions....\" In\r\n  this original scheme it is clearly marked out \"that this entire\r\n  Society and all its members fight for God under the faithful\r\n  obedience of the most sacred lord, the pope, and the other Roman\r\n  pontiffs his successors\"; and Ignatius makes particular mention that\r\n  each member should \"be bound by a special vow,\" beyond that formal\r\n  obligation under which all Christians are of obeying the pope, \"so\r\n  that whatsoever the present and other Roman pontiffs for the time\r\n  being shall ordain, pertaining to the advancement of souls and the\r\n  propagation of the faith, to whatever provinces he shall resolve to\r\n  send us, we are straightway bound to obey, as far as in us lies,\r\n  without any tergiversation or excuse, whether he send us among the\r\n  Turks or to any other unbelievers in being, even to those parts called\r\n  India, or to any heretics or schismatics or likewise to any\r\n  believers.\" Obedience to the general is enjoined \"in all things\r\n  pertaining to the institute of the Society ... and in him they shall\r\n  acknowledge Christ as though present, and as far as is becoming shall\r\n  venerate him\"; poverty is enjoined, and this rule affects not only the\r\n  individual but the common sustentation or care of the Society, except\r\n  that in the case of colleges revenues are allowed \"to be applied to\r\n  the wants and necessities of the students\"; and the private recitation\r\n  of the Office is distinctly mentioned. On the other hand, the\r\n  perpetuity of the general's office during his life was no part of the\r\n  original scheme.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of April 1541, Ignatius was unanimously chosen general. His\r\nrefusal of this post was overruled, so he entered on his office on the\r\n13th of April; and two days after, the newly constituted Society took\r\nits formal corporate vows in the basilica of San Paolo _fuori le mura_.\r\nScarcely was the Society launched when its members dispersed in various\r\ndirections to their new tasks. Alfonso Salmeron and Pasquier-Brouet, as\r\npapal delegates, were sent on a secret mission to Ireland to encourage\r\nthe native clergy and people to resist the religious changes introduced\r\nby Henry VIII.; Nicholas Bobadilla went to Naples; Faber, first to the\r\ndiet of Worms and then to Spain; Laynez and Claude le Jay to Germany,\r\nwhile Ignatius busied himself at Rome in good works and in drawing up\r\nthe constitutions and completing the _Spiritual Exercises_. Success\r\ncrowned these first efforts; and the Society began to win golden\r\nopinions. The first college was founded at Coimbra in 1542 by John III.\r\nof Portugal and put under the rectorship of Rodriguez. It was designed\r\nas a training school to feed the Indian mission of which Francis Xavier\r\nhad already taken the oversight, while a seminary at Goa was the second\r\ninstitution founded outside Rome in connexion with the Society. Both\r\nfrom the original scheme and from the foundation at Coimbra it is clear\r\nthat the original idea of the colleges was to provide for the education\r\nof future Jesuits. In Spain, national pride in the founder aided the\r\nSociety's cause almost as much as royal patronage did in Portugal; and\r\nthe third house was opened in Gandia under the protection of its duke,\r\nFrancisco Borgia, a grandson of Alexander VI. In Germany, the Jesuits\r\nwere eagerly welcomed as the only persons able to meet the Lutherans on\r\nequal terms. Only in France, among the countries which still were united\r\nwith the Roman Church, was their advance checked, owing to political\r\ndistrust of their Spanish origin, together with the hostility of the\r\nSorbonne and the bishop of Paris. However, after many difficulties, they\r\nsucceeded in getting a footing through the help of Guillaume du Prat,\r\nbishop of Clermont (d. 1560), who founded a college for them in 1545 in\r\nthe town of Billom, besides making over to them his house at Paris, the\r\nhôtel de Clermont, which became the nucleus of the afterwards famous\r\ncollege of Louis-le-Grand, while a formal legalization was granted to\r\nthem by the states-general at Poissy in 1561. In Rome, Paul III.'s\r\nfavour did not lessen. He bestowed on them the church of St Andrea and\r\nconferred at the same time the valuable privilege of making and altering\r\ntheir own statutes; besides the other points, in 1546, which Ignatius\r\nhad still more at heart, as touching the very essence of his institute,\r\nnamely, exemption from ecclesiastical offices and dignities and from the\r\ntask of acting as directors and confessors to convents of women. The\r\nformer of these measures effectually stopped any drain of the best\r\nmembers away from the society and limited their hopes within its bounds,\r\nby putting them more freely at the general's disposal, especially as it\r\nwas provided that the final vows could not be annulled, nor could a\r\nprofessed member be dismissed, save by the joint action of the general\r\nand the pope. The regulation as to convents seems partly due to a desire\r\nto avoid the worry and expenditure of time involved in the discharge of\r\nsuch offices and partly to a conviction that penitents living in\r\nenclosure, as all religious persons then were, would be of no effective\r\nuse to the Society; whereas the founder, against the wishes of several\r\nof his companions, laid much stress on the duty of accepting the post of\r\nconfessor to kings, queens and women of high rank when opportunity\r\npresented itself. And the year 1546 is notable in the annals of the\r\nSociety as that in which it embarked on its great educational career,\r\nespecially by the annexation of free day-schools to all its colleges.\r\n\r\n  The council of Trent, in its first period, seemed to increase the\r\n  reputation of the Society; for the pope chose Laynez, Faber and\r\n  Salmeron to act as his theologians in that assembly, and in this\r\n  capacity they had no little influence in framing its decrees. When the\r\n  council reassembled under Pius IV., Laynez and Salmeron again attended\r\n  in the same capacity. It is sometimes said that the council formally\r\n  approved of the Society. This is impossible; for as the Society had\r\n  received the papal approval, that of the council would have been\r\n  impertinent as well as unnecessary. St Charles Borromeo wrote to the\r\n  presiding cardinals, on the 11th of May 1562, saying that, as France\r\n  was disaffected to the Jesuits whom the pope wished to see established\r\n  in every country, Pius IV. desired, when the council was occupying\r\n  itself about regulars, that it should make some honourable mention of\r\n  the Society in order to recommend it. This was done in the\r\n  twenty-fifth session (cap. XVI., d.r.) when the decree was passed that\r\n  at the end of the time of probation novices should either be professed\r\n  or dismissed; and the words of the council are: \"By these things,\r\n  however, the Synod does not intend to make any innovation or\r\n  prohibition, so as to hinder the religious order of Clerks of the\r\n  Society of Jesus from being able to serve God and His Church, in\r\n  accordance with their pious institute approved of by the Holy\r\n  Apostolic See.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1548 the Society received a valuable recruit in the person of\r\nFrancisco Borgia, duke of Gandia, afterwards thrice general, while two\r\nimportant events marked 1550--the foundation of the Collegio Romano and\r\na fresh confirmation of the Society by Julius III. The German college,\r\nfor the children of poor nobles, was founded in 1552; and in the same\r\nyear Ignatius firmly settled the discipline of the Society by putting\r\ndown, with promptness and severity, some attempts at independent action\r\non the part of Rodriguez at Coimbra--this being the occasion of the\r\nfamous letter on obedience; while 1553 saw the despatch of a mission to\r\nAbyssinia with one of the fathers as patriarch, and the first rift\r\nwithin the lute when the pope thought that the Spanish Jesuits were\r\ntaking part with the emperor against the Holy See. Paul IV. (whose\r\nelection alarmed the Jesuits, for they had not found him very friendly\r\nas cardinal) was for a time managed with supreme tact by Ignatius, whom\r\nhe respected personally. In 1556, the founder died and left the Society\r\nconsisting of forty-five professed fathers and two thousand ordinary\r\nmembers, distributed over twelve provinces, with more than a hundred\r\ncolleges and houses.\r\n\r\n  After the death of the first general there was an interregnum of two\r\n  years, with Laynez as vicar. During this long period he occupied\r\n  himself with completing the constitutions by incorporating certain\r\n  declarations, said to be Ignatian, which explained and sometimes\r\n  completely altered the meaning of the original text. Laynez was an\r\n  astute politician and saw the vast capabilities of the Society over a\r\n  far wider field than the founder contemplated; and he prepared to give\r\n  it the direction that it has since followed. In some senses, this\r\n  learned and consummately clever man may be looked upon as the real\r\n  founder of the Society as history knows it. Having carefully prepared\r\n  the way, he summoned the general congregation from which he emerged as\r\n  second general in 1556. As soon as Ignatius had died Paul IV.\r\n  announced his intention of instituting reforms in the Society,\r\n  especially in two points: the public recitation of the office in choir\r\n  and the limitation of the general's office to a term of three years.\r\n  Despite all the protests and negotiations of Laynez, the pope remained\r\n  obstinate; and there was nothing but to submit. On the 8th of\r\n  September 1558, two points were added to the constitutions: that the\r\n  generalship should be triennial and not perpetual, although after the\r\n  three years the general might be confirmed; and that the canonical\r\n  hours should be observed in choir after the manner of the other\r\n  orders, but with that moderation which should seem expedient to the\r\n  general. Taking advantage of this last clause, Laynez applied the new\r\n  law to two houses only, namely, Rome and Lisbon, the other houses\r\n  contenting themselves with singing vespers on feast days; and as soon\r\n  as Paul IV. died, Laynez, acting on advice, quietly ignored for the\r\n  future the orders of the late pope. He also succeeded in increasing\r\n  further the already enormous powers of the general. Laynez took a\r\n  leading part in the colloquy of Poissy in 1561 between the Catholics\r\n  and Huguenots; and obtained a legal footing from the states-general\r\n  for colleges of the Society in France. He died in 1564, leaving the\r\n  Society increased to eighteen provinces with a hundred and thirty\r\n  colleges, and was succeeded by Francisco Borgia. During the third\r\n  generalate, Pius V. confirmed all the former privileges, and in the\r\n  amplest form extended to the Society, as being a mendicant institute,\r\n  all favours that had been or might afterwards be granted to such\r\n  mendicant bodies. It was a trifling set-off that in 1567 the pope\r\n  again enjoined the fathers to keep choir and to admit only the\r\n  professed to priests' orders, especially as Gregory XIII. rescinded\r\n  both these injunctions in 1573; and indeed, as regards the hours, all\r\n  that Pius V. was able to obtain was the nominal concession that the\r\n  breviary should be recited in choir in the professed houses only, and\r\n  that not of necessity by more than two persons at a time. Everard\r\n  Mercurian, a Fleming, and a subject of Spain, succeeded Borgia in\r\n  1573, being forced on the Society by the pope, in preference to\r\n  Polanco, Ignatius's secretary and the vicar-general, who was rejected\r\n  partly as a Spaniard and still more because he was a \"New Christian\"\r\n  of Jewish origin and therefore objected to in Spain itself. During his\r\n  term of office there took place the troubles in Rome concerning the\r\n  English college and the subsequent Jesuit rule over that institution;\r\n  and in 1580 the first Jesuit mission, headed by the redoubtable Robert\r\n  Parsons and the saintly Edmund Campion, set out for England. This\r\n  mission, on one side, carried on an active propaganda against\r\n  Elizabeth in favour of Spain; and on the other, among the true\r\n  missionaries, was marked with devoted zeal and heroism even to the\r\n  ghastly death of traitors. Claude Acquaviva, the fifth general, held\r\n  office from 1581 to 1615, a time almost coinciding with the high tide\r\n  of the successful reaction, chiefly due to the Jesuits. He was an\r\n  able, strong-willed man, and crushed what was tantamount to a\r\n  rebellion in Spain. It was during this struggle that Mariana, the\r\n  historian and the author of the famous _De rege_ in which he defends\r\n  tyrannicide, wrote his treatise _On the Defects in the Government of\r\n  the Society_. He confessed freely that the Society had faults and that\r\n  there was a great deal of unrest among the members; and he mentioned\r\n  among the various points calling for reform the education of the\r\n  novices and students; the state of the lay brother and the possessions\r\n  of the Society; the spying system, which he declared to be carried so\r\n  far that, if the general's archives at Rome should be searched, not\r\n  one Jesuit's character would be found to escape; the monopoly of the\r\n  higher offices by a small clique; and the absence of all encouragement\r\n  and recompense for the best men of the Society.\r\n\r\nIt was chiefly during the generalship of Acquaviva that the Society\r\nbegan to gain an evil reputation which eclipsed its good report. In\r\nFrance the Jesuits joined, if they did not originate, the league against\r\nHenry of Navarre. Absolution was refused by them to those who would not\r\njoin in the Guise rebellion, and Acquaviva is said to have tried to stop\r\nthem, but in vain. The assassination of Henry III. in the interests of\r\nthe league and the wounding of Henry IV. in 1594 by Chastel, a pupil of\r\ntheirs, revealed the danger that the whole Society was running by the\r\nintrigues of a few men. The Jesuits were banished from France in 1594,\r\nbut were allowed to return by Henry IV. under conditions; as Sully has\r\nrecorded, the king declared his only motive to be the expediency of not\r\ndriving them into a corner with possible disastrous results to his life,\r\nand because his only hope of tranquillity lay in appeasing them and\r\ntheir powerful friends. In England the political schemings of Parsons\r\nwere no small factors in the odium which fell on the Society at large;\r\nand his determination to capture the English Catholics as an apanage of\r\nthe Society, to the exclusion of all else, was an object lesson to the\r\nrest of Europe of a restless ambition and lust of domination which were\r\nto find many imitators. The political turn which was being given by some\r\nto the Society, to the detriment of its real spiritual work, evoked the\r\nfears of the wiser heads of the body; and in the fifth general\r\ncongregation held in 1593-1594 it was decreed: \"Whereas in these times\r\nof difficulty and danger it has happened through the fault of certain\r\nindividuals, through ambition and intemperate zeal, that our institute\r\nhas been ill spoken of in divers places and before divers sovereigns ...\r\nit is severely and strictly forbidden to all members of the Society to\r\ninterfere in any manner whatever in public affairs even though they be\r\nthereto invited; or to deviate from the institute through entreaty,\r\npersuasion or any other motive whatever.\" It would have been well had\r\nAcquaviva enforced this decree; but Parsons was allowed to keep on with\r\nhis work, and other Jesuits in France for many years after directed, to\r\nthe loss of religion, affairs of state. In 1605 took place in England\r\nthe Gunpowder Plot, in which Henry Garnet, the superior of the Society\r\nin England, was implicated. That the Jesuits were the instigators of\r\nthe plot there is no evidence, but they were in close touch with the\r\nconspirators, of whose designs Garnet had a general knowledge. There is\r\nnow no reasonable doubt that he and other Jesuits were legally\r\naccessories, and that the condemnation of Garnet as a traitor was\r\nsubstantially just (see GARNET, HENRY).\r\n\r\n  It was during Acquaviva's generalship that Philip II. of Spain\r\n  complained bitterly of the Society to Sixtus V., and encouraged him in\r\n  those plans of reform (even to changing the name) which were only cut\r\n  short by the pope's death in 1590, and also that the long protracted\r\n  discussions on grace, wherein the Dominicans contended against the\r\n  Jesuits, were carried on at Rome with little practical result, by the\r\n  Congregation _de auxiliis_, which sat from 1598 till 1607. The _Ratio\r\n  Studiorum_ took its shape during this time. The Jesuit influence at\r\n  Rome was supported by the Spanish ambassador; but when Henry IV. \"went\r\n  to Mass,\" the balance inclined to the side of France, and the Spanish\r\n  monopoly became a thing of the past. Acquaviva saw the expulsion of\r\n  the Jesuits from Venice in 1606 for siding with Paul V. when he placed\r\n  the republic under interdict, but did not live to see their recall,\r\n  which took place at the intercession of Louis XIV. in 1657. He also\r\n  had to banish Parsons from Rome, by order of Clement VIII., who was\r\n  wearied with the perpetual complaints made against that intriguer.\r\n  Gregory XIV., by the bull _Ecclesiae Christi_ (July 28, 1591), again\r\n  confirmed the Society, and granted that Jesuits might, for true cause,\r\n  be expelled from the body without any form of trial or even\r\n  documentary procedure, besides denouncing excommunications against\r\n  every one, save the pope or his legates, who directly or indirectly\r\n  infringed the constitutions of the Society or attempted to bring about\r\n  any change therein.\r\n\r\n  Under Vitelleschi, the next general, the Society celebrated its first\r\n  centenary on the 25th of September 1639, the hundredth anniversary of\r\n  the verbal approbation given to the scheme by Paul III. During this\r\n  hundred years the Society had grown to thirty-six provinces, with\r\n  eight hundred houses containing some fifteen thousand members. In 1640\r\n  broke out the great Jansenist controversy, in which the Society took\r\n  the leading part on one side and finally secured the victory. In this\r\n  same year, considering themselves ill-used by Olivarez, prime minister\r\n  of Philip IV. of Spain, the Jesuits powerfully aided the revolution\r\n  which placed the duke of Braganza on the throne of Portugal; and their\r\n  services were rewarded for nearly one hundred years with the practical\r\n  control of ecclesiastical and almost of civil affairs in that kingdom.\r\n\r\n  The Society also gained ground steadily in France; for, though held in\r\n  check by Richelieu and little more favoured by Mazarin, yet from the\r\n  moment that Louis XIV. took the reins, their star was in the\r\n  ascendant, and Jesuit confessors, the most celebrated of whom were\r\n  François de La Chaise (q.v.) and Michel Le Tellier (1643-1719), guided\r\n  the policy of the king, not hesitating to take his side in his quarrel\r\n  with the Holy See, which nearly resulted in a schism, nor to sign the\r\n  Gallican articles. Their hostility to the Huguenots forced on the\r\n  revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, and their war against their\r\n  Jansenist opponents did not cease till the very walls of Port Royal\r\n  were demolished in 1710, even to the very abbey church itself, and the\r\n  bodies of the dead taken with every mark of insult from their graves\r\n  and literally flung to the dogs to devour. But while thus gaining\r\n  power in one direction, the Society was losing it in another. The\r\n  Japanese mission had vanished in blood in 1651; and though many\r\n  Jesuits died with their converts bravely as martyrs for the faith, yet\r\n  it is impossible to acquit them of a large share in the causes of that\r\n  overthrow. It was also about this same period that the grave scandal\r\n  of the Chinese and Malabar rites began to attract attention in Europe,\r\n  and to make thinking men ask seriously whether the Jesuit missionaries\r\n  in those parts taught anything which could fairly be called\r\n  Christianity at all. When it was remembered, too, that they had\r\n  decided, at a council held at Lima, that it was inexpedient to impose\r\n  any act of Christian devotion except baptism, on the South American\r\n  converts, without the greatest precautions, on the ground of\r\n  intellectual difficulties, it is not wonderful that this doubt was not\r\n  satisfactorily cleared up, notably in face of the charges brought\r\n  against the Society by Bernardin de Cardonas, bishop of Paraguay, and\r\n  the saintly Juan de Palafox (q.v.), bishop of Angelopolis in Mexico.\r\n\r\n  But \"the terrible power in the universal church, the great riches and\r\n  the extraordinary prestige\" of the Society, which Palafox complained\r\n  had raised it \"above all dignities, laws, councils and apostolic\r\n  constitutions,\" carried with them the seeds of rapid and inevitable\r\n  decay. A succession of devout but incapable generals, after the death\r\n  of Acquaviva, saw the gradual secularization of tone by the flocking\r\n  in of recruits of rank and wealth desirous to share in the glories and\r\n  influence of the Society, but not well adapted to increase them. The\r\n  general's supremacy received a shock when the eleventh general\r\n  congregation appointed Oliva as vicar, with the right of succession\r\n  and powers that practically superseded those of the general Goswin\r\n  Nickel, whose infirmities, it is said, did not permit him to govern\r\n  with the necessary application and vigour; and an attempt was made to\r\n  depose Tirso Gonzalez, the thirteenth general, whose views on\r\n  probabilism diverged from those favoured by the rest of the Jesuits.\r\n  Though the political weight of the Society continued to increase in\r\n  the cabinets of Europe, it was being steadily weakened internally. The\r\n  Jesuits abandoned the system of free education which had won them so\r\n  much influence and honour; by attaching themselves exclusively to the\r\n  interests of courts, they lost favour with the middle and lower\r\n  classes; and above all, their monopoly of power and patronage in\r\n  France, with the fatal use they had made of it, drew down the\r\n  bitterest hostility upon them. It was to their credit, indeed, that\r\n  the encyclopaedists attacked them as the foremost representatives of\r\n  Christianity, but they are accountable in no small degree in France,\r\n  as in England, for alienating the minds of men from the religion for\r\n  which they professed to work.\r\n\r\nBut the most fatal part of the policy of the Society was its activity,\r\nwealth and importance as a great trading firm with branch houses\r\nscattered over the richest countries of the world. Its founder, with a\r\nwise instinct, had forbidden the accumulation of wealth; its own\r\nconstitutions, as revised in the 84th decree of the sixth general\r\ncongregation, had forbidden all pursuits of a commercial nature, as also\r\nhad various popes; but nevertheless the trade went on unceasingly,\r\nnecessarily with the full knowledge of the general, unless it be pleaded\r\nthat the system of obligatory espionage had completely broken down. The\r\nfirst muttering of the storm which was soon to break was heard in a\r\nbreve issued in 1741 by Benedict XIV., wherein he denounced the Jesuit\r\noffenders as \"disobedient, contumacious, captious and reprobate\r\npersons,\" and enacted many stringent regulations for their better\r\ngovernment. The first serious attack came from a country where they had\r\nbeen long dominant. In 1753 Spain and Portugal exchanged certain\r\nAmerican provinces with each other, which involved a transfer of\r\nsovereign rights over Paraguay; but it was also provided that the\r\npopulations should severally migrate also, that the subjects of each\r\ncrown might remain the same as before. The inhabitants of the\r\n\"reductions,\" whom the Jesuits had trained in the use of European arms\r\nand discipline, naturally rose in defence of their homes, and attacked\r\nthe troops and authorities. Their previous docility and their entire\r\nsubmission to the Jesuits left no possible doubt as to the source of the\r\nrebellion, and gave the enemies of the Jesuits a handle against them\r\nthat was not forgotten. In 1757 Carvalho, marquis of Pombal, prime\r\nminister of Joseph I. of Portugal, and an old pupil of the Jesuits at\r\nCoimbra, dismissed the three Jesuit chaplains of the king and named\r\nthree secular priests in their stead. He next complained to Benedict\r\nXIV. that the trading operations of the Society hampered the commercial\r\nprosperity of the nation, and asked for remedial measures. The pope, who\r\nknew the situation, committed a visitation of the Society to Cardinal\r\nSaldanha, an intimate friend of Pombal, who issued a severe decree\r\nagainst the Jesuits and ordered the confiscation of all their\r\nmerchandise. But at this juncture Benedict XIV., the most learned and\r\nable pope of the period, was succeeded by a pope strongly in favour of\r\nthe Jesuits, Clement XIII. Pombal, finding no help from Rome, adopted\r\nother means. The king was fired at and wounded on returning from a visit\r\nto his mistress on the 3rd of September 1758. The duke of Aveiro and\r\nother high personages were tried and executed for conspiracy; while some\r\nof the Jesuits, who had undoubtedly been in communication with them,\r\nwere charged, on doubtful evidence, with complicity in the attempted\r\nassassination. Pombal charged the whole Society with the possible guilt\r\nof a few, and, unwilling to wait the dubious issue of an application to\r\nthe pope for licence to try them in the civil courts, whence they were\r\nexempt, issued on the 1st of September 1759 a decree ordering the\r\nimmediate deportation of every Jesuit from Portugal and all its\r\ndependencies and their suppression by the bishops in the schools and\r\nuniversities. Those in Portugal were at once shipped, in great misery,\r\nto the papal states, and were soon followed by those in the colonies. In\r\nFrance, Madame de Pompadour was their enemy because they had refused her\r\nabsolution while she remained the king's mistress; but the immediate\r\ncause of their ruin was the bankruptcy of Father Lavalette, the Jesuit\r\nsuperior in Martinique, a daring speculator, who failed, after trading\r\nfor some years, for 2,400,000 francs and brought ruin upon some French\r\ncommercial houses of note. Lorenzo Ricci, then general of the Society,\r\nrepudiated the debt, alleging lack of authority on Lavalette's part to\r\npledge the credit of the Society, and he was sued by the creditors.\r\nLosing his cause, he appealed to the parlement of Paris, and it, to\r\ndecide the issue raised by Ricci, required the constitutions of the\r\nJesuits to be produced in evidence, and affirmed the judgment of the\r\ncourts below. But the publicity given to a document scarcely known till\r\nthen raised the utmost indignation against the Society. A royal\r\ncommission, appointed by the duc de Choiseul to examine the\r\nconstitutions, convoked a private assembly of fifty-one archbishops and\r\nbishops under the presidency of Cardinal de Luynes, all of whom except\r\nsix voted that the unlimited authority of the general was incompatible\r\nwith the laws of France, and that the appointment of a resident vicar,\r\nsubject to those laws, was the only solution of the question fair on all\r\nsides. Ricci replied with the historical answer, _Sint ut sunt, aut non\r\nsint_; and after some further delay, during which much interest was\r\nexerted in their favour, the Jesuits were suppressed by an edict in\r\nNovember 1764, but suffered to remain on the footing of secular priests,\r\na grace withdrawn in 1767, when they were expelled from the kingdom. In\r\nthe very same year, Charles III. of Spain, a monarch known for personal\r\ndevoutness, convinced, on evidence not now forthcoming, that the Jesuits\r\nwere plotting against his authority, prepared, through his minister\r\nD'Aranda, a decree suppressing the Society in every part of his\r\ndominions. Sealed despatches were sent to every Spanish colony, to be\r\nopened on the same day, the 2nd of April 1767, when the measure was to\r\ntake effect in Spain itself, and the expulsion was relentlessly carried\r\nout, nearly six thousand priests being deported from Spain alone, and\r\nsent to the Italian coast, whence, however, they were repelled by the\r\norders of the pope and Ricci himself, finding a refuge at Corte in\r\nCorsica, after some months' suffering in overcrowded vessels at sea. The\r\ngeneral's object may probably have been to accentuate the harshness with\r\nwhich the fathers had been treated, and so to increase public sympathy,\r\nbut the actual result of his policy was blame for the cruelty with which\r\nhe enhanced their misfortunes, for the poverty of Corsica made even a\r\nbare subsistence scarcely procurable for them there. The Bourbon courts\r\nof Naples and Parma followed the example of France and Spain; Clement\r\nXIII. retorted with a bull launched at the weakest adversary, and\r\ndeclaring the rank and title of the duke of Parma forfeit. The Bourbon\r\nsovereigns threatened to make war on the pope in return (France, indeed,\r\nseizing on the county of Avignon), and a joint note demanding a\r\nretractation, and the abolition of the Jesuits, was presented by the\r\nFrench ambassador at Rome on the 10th of December 1768 in the name of\r\nFrance, Spain and the two Sicilies. The pope, a man of eighty-two, died\r\nof apoplexy, brought on by the shock, early in 1769. Cardinal Lorenzo\r\nGanganelli, a conventual Franciscan, was chosen to succeed him, and took\r\nthe name of Clement XIV. He endeavoured to avert the decision forced\r\nupon him, but, as Portugal joined the Bourbon league, and Maria Theresa\r\nwith her son the emperor Joseph II. ceased to protect the Jesuits, there\r\nremained only the petty kingdom of Sardinia in their favour, though the\r\nfall of Choiseul in France raised the hopes of the Society for a time.\r\nThe pope began with some preliminary measures, permitting first the\r\nrenewal of lawsuits against the Society, which had been suspended by\r\npapal authority, and which, indeed, had in no case been ever successful\r\nat Rome. He then closed the Collegio Romano, on the plea of its\r\ninsolvency, seized the houses at Frascati and Tivoli, and broke up the\r\nestablishments in Bologna and the Legations. Finally on the 21st of July\r\n1773 the famous breve _Dominus ac Redemptor_ appeared, suppressing the\r\nSociety of Jesus. This remarkable document opens by citing a long series\r\nof precedents for the suppression of religious orders by the Holy See,\r\namongst which occurs the ill-omened instance of the Templars. It then\r\nbriefly sketches the objects and history of the Jesuits themselves. It\r\nspeaks of their defiance of their own constitution, expressly revived by\r\nPaul V., forbidding them to meddle in politics; of the great ruin to\r\nsouls caused by their quarrels with local ordinaries and the other\r\nreligious orders, their condescension to heathen usages in the East, and\r\nthe disturbances, resulting in persecutions of the Church, which they\r\nhad stirred up even in Catholic countries, so that several popes had\r\nbeen obliged to punish them. Seeing then that the Catholic sovereigns\r\nhad been forced to expel them, that many bishops and other eminent\r\npersons demanded their extinction, and that the Society had ceased to\r\nfulfil the intention of its institute, the pope declares it necessary\r\nfor the peace of the Church that it should be suppressed, extinguished,\r\nabolished and abrogated for ever, with all its houses, colleges, schools\r\nand hospitals; transfers all the authority of its general or officers to\r\nthe local ordinaries; forbids the reception of any more novices,\r\ndirecting that such as were actually in probation should be dismissed,\r\nand declaring that profession in the Society should not serve as a title\r\nto holy orders. Priests of the Society are given the option of either\r\njoining other orders or remaining as secular clergy, under obedience to\r\nthe ordinaries, who are empowered to grant or withhold from them\r\nlicences to hear confessions. Such of the fathers as are engaged in the\r\nwork of education are permitted to continue, on condition of abstaining\r\nfrom lax and questionable doctrines apt to cause strife and trouble. The\r\nquestion of missions is reserved, and the relaxations granted to the\r\nSociety in such matters as fasting, reciting the hours and reading\r\nheretical books, are withdrawn; while the breve ends with clauses\r\ncarefully drawn to bar any legal exceptions that might be taken against\r\nits full validity and obligation. It has been necessary to cite these\r\nheads of the breve because the apologists of the Society allege that no\r\nmotive influenced the pope save the desire of peace at any price, and\r\nthat he did not believe in the culpability of the fathers. The\r\ncategorical charges made in the document rebut this plea. The pope\r\nfollowed up this breve by appointing a congregation of cardinals to take\r\npossession of the temporalities of the Society, and armed it with\r\nsummary powers against all who should attempt to retain or conceal any\r\nof the property. He also threw Lorenzo Ricci, the general, into prison,\r\nfirst in the English college and then in the castle of St Angelo, where\r\nhe died in 1775, under the pontificate of Pius VI., who, though not\r\nunfavourable to the Society, and owing his own advancement to it, dared\r\nnot release him, probably because his continued imprisonment was made a\r\ncondition by the powers who enjoyed a right of veto in papal elections.\r\nIn September 1774 Clement XIV. died after much suffering, and the\r\nquestion has been hotly debated ever since whether poison was the cause\r\nof his death. But the latest researches have shown that there is no\r\nevidence to support the theory of poison. Salicetti, the pope's\r\nphysician, denied that the body showed signs of poisoning, and Tanucci,\r\nNeapolitan ambassador at Rome, who had a large share in procuring the\r\nbreve of suppression, entirely acquits the Jesuits, while F. Theiner, no\r\nfriend to the Society, does the like.\r\n\r\nAt the date of this suppression, the Society had 41 provinces and 22,589\r\nmembers, of whom 11,295 were priests. Far from submitting to the papal\r\nbreve, the ex-Jesuits, after some ineffectual attempts at direct\r\nresistance, withdrew into the territories of the free-thinking\r\nsovereigns of Russia and Prussia, Frederick II. and Catherine II., who\r\nbecame their active friends and protectors; and the fathers alleged as a\r\nprinciple, in so far as their theology is concerned, that no papal bull\r\nis binding in a state whose sovereign has not approved and authorized\r\nits publication and execution. Russia formed the headquarters of the\r\nSociety, and two forged breves were speedily circulated, being dated\r\nJune 9 and June 29, 1774, approving their establishment in Russia, and\r\nimplying the repeal of the breve of suppression. But these are\r\ncontradicted by the tenor of five genuine breves issued in September\r\n1774 to the archbishop of Gnesen, and making certain assurances to the\r\nex-Jesuits, on condition of their complete obedience to the injunctions\r\nalready laid on them. The Jesuits also pleaded a verbal approbation by\r\nPius VI., technically known as an _Oraculum vivae vocis_, but this is\r\ninvalid for purposes of law unless reduced to writing and duly\r\nauthenticated.\r\n\r\nThey elected three Poles successively as generals, taking, however, only\r\nthe title of vicars, till on the 7th of March 1801 Pius VII. granted\r\nthem liberty to reconstitute themselves in north Russia, and permitted\r\nKareu, then vicar, to exercise full authority as general. On the 30th of\r\nJuly 1804 a similar breve restored the Jesuits in the Two Sicilies, at\r\nthe express desire of Ferdinand IV., the pope thus anticipating the\r\nfurther action of 1814, when, by the constitution _Sollicitudo omnium\r\nEcclesiarum_, he revoked the action of Clement XIV., and formally\r\nrestored the Society to corporate legal existence, yet not only omitted\r\nany censure of his predecessor's conduct, but all vindication of the\r\nJesuits from the heavy charges in the breve _Dominus ac Redemptor_. In\r\nFrance, even after their expulsion in 1765, they had maintained a\r\nprecarious footing in the country under the partial disguise and names\r\nof \"Fathers of the Faith\" or \"Clerks of the Sacred Heart,\" but were\r\nobliged by Napoleon I. to retire in 1804. They reappeared under their\r\ntrue name in 1814, and obtained formal licence in 1822, but became the\r\nobjects of so much hostility that Charles X. deprived them by ordinance\r\nof the right of instruction, and obliged all applicants for licences as\r\nteachers to make oath that they did not belong to any community\r\nunrecognized by the laws. They were dispersed again by the revolution of\r\nJuly 1830, but soon reappeared and, though put to much inconvenience\r\nduring the latter years of Louis Philippe's reign, notably in 1845,\r\nmaintained their footing, recovered the right to teach freely after the\r\nrevolution of 1848, and gradually became the leading educational and\r\necclesiastical power in France, notably under the Second Empire, till\r\nthey were once more expelled by the Ferry laws of 1880, though they\r\nquietly returned since the execution of those measures. They were again\r\nexpelled by the Law of Associations of 1901. In Spain they came back\r\nwith Ferdinand VII., but were expelled at the constitutional rising in\r\n1820, returning in 1823, when the duke of Angoulême's army replaced\r\nFerdinand on his throne; they were driven out once more by Espartero in\r\n1835, and have had no legal position since, though their presence is\r\nopenly tolerated. In Portugal, ranging themselves on the side of Dom\r\nMiguel, they fell with his cause, and were exiled in 1834. There are\r\nsome to this day in Lisbon under the name of \"Fathers of the Faith.\"\r\nRussia, which had been their warmest patron, drove them from St\r\nPetersburg and Moscow in 1813, and from the whole empire in 1820, mainly\r\non the plea of attempted proselytizing in the imperial army. Holland\r\ndrove them out in 1816, and, by giving them thus a valid excuse for\r\naiding the Belgian revolution of 1830, secured them the strong position\r\nthey have ever since held in Belgium; but they have succeeded in\r\nreturning to Holland. They were expelled from Switzerland in 1847-1848\r\nfor the part they were charged with in exciting the war of the\r\nSonderbund. In south Germany, inclusive of Austria and Bavaria, their\r\nannals since their restoration have been uneventful; but in north\r\nGermany, owing to the footing Frederick II. had given them in Prussia,\r\nthey became very powerful, especially in the Rhine provinces, and,\r\ngradually moulding the younger generation of clergy after the close of\r\nthe War of Liberation, succeeded in spreading Ultramontane views amongst\r\nthem, and so leading up to the difficulties with the civil government\r\nwhich issued in the Falk laws, and their own expulsion by decree of the\r\nGerman parliament (June 19, 1872). Since then many attempts have been\r\nmade to procure the recall of the Society to the German Empire, but\r\nwithout success, although as individuals they are now allowed in the\r\ncountry. In Great Britain, whither they began to straggle over during\r\nthe revolutionary troubles at the close of the 18th century, and where,\r\npractically unaffected by the clause directed against them in the\r\nEmancipation Act of 1829, their chief settlement has been at Stonyhurst\r\nin Lancashire, an estate conferred on them by Thomas Weld in 1795, they\r\nhave been unmolested; but there has been little affinity to the order in\r\nthe British temperament, and the English province has consequently never\r\nrisen to numerical or intellectual importance in the Society. In Rome\r\nitself, its progress after the restoration was at first slow, and it was\r\nnot till the reign of Leo XII. (1823-1829) that it recovered its place\r\nas the chief educational body there. It advanced steadily under Gregory\r\nXVI., and, though it was at first shunned by Pius IX., it secured his\r\nentire confidence after his return from Gaeta in 1849, and obtained from\r\nhim a special breve erecting the staff of its literary journal, the\r\n_Civiltà Cattolica_, into a perpetual college under the general of the\r\nJesuits, for the purpose of teaching and propagating the faith in its\r\npages. How, with this pope's support throughout his long reign, the\r\ngradual filling of nearly all the sees of Latin Christendom with bishops\r\nof their own selection, and their practical capture, directly or\r\nindirectly, of the education of the clergy in seminaries, they contrived\r\nto stamp out the last remains of independence everywhere, and to crown\r\nthe Ultramontane triumph with the Vatican Decrees, is matter of familiar\r\nknowledge. Leo XIII., while favouring them somewhat, never gave them his\r\nfull confidence; and by his adhesion to the Thomist philosophy and\r\ntheology, and his active work for the regeneration and progress of the\r\nolder orders, he made another suppression possible by destroying much of\r\ntheir prestige. But the usual sequence has been observed under Pius X.,\r\nwho appeared to be greatly in favour of the Society and to rely upon\r\nthem for many of the measures of his pontificate.\r\n\r\nThe Society has been ruled by twenty-five generals and four vicars from\r\nits foundation to the present day (1910). Of all the various\r\nnationalities represented in the Society, neither France, its original\r\ncradle, nor England, has ever given it a head, while Spain, Italy,\r\nHolland, Belgium, Germany and Poland, were all represented. The numbers\r\nof the Society are not accurately known, but are estimated at about\r\n20,000, in all parts of the world; and of these the English, Irish and\r\nAmerican Jesuits are under 3000.\r\n\r\n  The generals of the Jesuits have been as follow:--\r\n\r\n   1.

In 1842 he\r\nwent to New York City, where after some experience in business he\r\nestablished a banking house in 1852. In 1856 he organized the banking\r\nfirm of M. K. Jesup & Company, which after two reorganizations became\r\nCuyler, Morgan & Jesup. He became widely known as a financier, retiring\r\nfrom active business in 1884. He was best known, however, as a\r\nmunificent patron of scientific research, a large contributor to the\r\nneeds of education, and a public-spirited citizen of wide interests, who\r\ndid much for the betterment of social conditions in New York. He\r\ncontributed largely to the funds for the Arctic expeditions of Commander\r\nRobert E. Peary, becoming president of the Peary Arctic Club in 1899. To\r\nthe American museum of natural history, in New York City, he gave large\r\nsums in his lifetime and bequeathed $1,000,000. He was president of the\r\nNew York chamber of commerce from 1899 until 1907, and was the largest\r\nsubscriber to its new building. To his native town he gave a fine public\r\nlibrary. He died in New York City on the 22nd of January 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJESUS CHRIST. To write a summary account of the life of Christ, though\r\nalways involving a grave responsibility, was until recent years a\r\ncomparatively straightforward task; for it was assumed that all that was\r\nneeded, or could be offered, was a chronological outline based on a\r\nharmony of the four canonical Gospels. But to-day history is not\r\nsatisfied by this simple procedure. Literary criticism has analysed the\r\ndocuments, and has already established some important results; and many\r\nquestions are still in debate, the answers to which must affect our\r\njudgment of the historical value of the existing narratives. It seems\r\ntherefore consonant alike with prudence and reverence to refrain from\r\nattempting to combine afresh into a single picture the materials\r\nderivable from the various documents, and to endeavour instead to\r\ndescribe the main contents of the sources from which our knowledge of\r\nthe Lord Jesus Christ as an historical personage is ultimately drawn,\r\nand to observe the picture of Him which each writer in turn has offered\r\nto us.\r\n\r\n  The chief elements of the evidence with which we shall deal are the\r\n  following:--\r\n\r\n  1. First, because earliest in point of time, the references to the\r\n  Lord Jesus Christ in the earliest Epistles of St Paul.\r\n\r\n  2. The Gospel according to St Mark.\r\n\r\n  3. A document, no longer extant, which was partially incorporated into\r\n  the Gospels of St Matthew and St Luke.\r\n\r\n  4. Further information added by St Matthew's Gospel.\r\n\r\n  5. Further information added by St Luke's Gospel.\r\n\r\n  6. The Gospel according to St John.\r\n\r\n  With regard to traditional sayings or doings of our Lord, which were\r\n  only written down at a later period, it will suffice to say that those\r\n  which have any claim to be genuine are very scanty, and that their\r\n  genuineness has to be tested by their correspondence with the great\r\n  bulk of information which is derived from the sources already\r\n  enumerated. The fictitious literature of the second and third\r\n  centuries, known as the Apocryphal Gospels, offers no direct evidence\r\n  of any historical value at all: it is chiefly valuable for the\r\n  contrast which it presents to the grave simplicity of the canonical\r\n  Gospels, and as showing how incapable a later age was of adding\r\n  anything to the Gospel history which was not palpably absurd.\r\n\r\n1. _Letters of St Paul._--In the order of chronology we must give the\r\nfirst place to the earliest letters of St Paul. The first piece of\r\nChristian literature which has an independent existence and to which we\r\ncan fix a date is St Paul's first Epistle to the Thessalonians.\r\nLightfoot dates it in 52 or 53; Harnack places it five years earlier. We\r\nmay say, then, that it was written some twenty years after the\r\nCrucifixion. St Paul is not an historian; he is not attempting to\r\ndescribe what Jesus Christ said or did. He is writing a letter to\r\nencourage a little Christian society which he, a Jew, had founded in a\r\ndistant Greek city; and he reminds his readers of many things which he\r\nhad told them when he was with them. The evidence, to be collected from\r\nhis epistles generally must not detain us here, but we may glance for a\r\nmoment at this one letter, because it contains what appears to be the\r\nfirst mention of Jesus Christ in the literature of the world. Those who\r\nwould get a true history cannot afford to neglect their earliest\r\ndocuments. Now the opening sentence of this letter is as follows: \"Paul\r\nand Silvanus and Timothy to the Church of the Thessalonians in God the\r\nFather and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace.\" Three men\r\nwith Greek or Latin names are writing to some kind of assembly in a city\r\nof Macedonia. The writers are Jews, to judge by their salutation of\r\n\"peace,\" and by their mention of \"God the Father,\" and of the assembly\r\nor society as being \"in\" Him. But what is this new name which is placed\r\nside by side with the Divine Name--\"in God the Father and the Lord Jesus\r\nChrist\"? An educated Greek, who knew something (as many at that time\r\ndid) of the Greek translation of the ancient Hebrew Scriptures, if he\r\nhad picked up this letter before he had ever heard the name of Jesus\r\nChrist, would have been deeply interested in these opening words. He\r\nwould have known that \"Jesus\" was the Greek form of Joshua; that\r\n\"Christ\" was the Greek rendering of Messiah, or Anointed, the title of\r\nthe great King for whom the Jews were looking; he might further have\r\nremembered that \"the Lord\" is the expression which the Greek Old\r\nTestament constantly uses instead of the ineffable name of God, which we\r\nnow call \"Jehovah\" (q.v.). Who, then, he might well ask is this Jesus\r\nChrist who is lifted to this unexampled height? For it is plain that\r\nJesus Christ stands in some close relation to \"God the Father,\" and that\r\non the ground of that relation a society has been built up, apparently\r\nby Jews, in a Greek city far distant from Palestine. He would learn\r\nsomething as he read on; for the letter makes a passing reference to the\r\nfoundation of the society, and to the expansion of its influence in\r\nother parts of Greece; to the conversion of its members from heathenism,\r\nand to the consequent sufferings at the hands of their heathen\r\nneighbours. The writers speak of themselves as \"apostles,\" or\r\nmessengers, of Christ; they refer to similar societies \"in Christ\r\nJesus,\" which they call \"churches of God,\" in Judaea, and they say that\r\nthese also suffer from the Jews there, who had \"killed the Lord Jesus\"\r\nsome time before. But they further speak of Jesus as \"raised from the\r\ndead,\" and they refer to the belief which they had led the society to\r\nentertain, that He would come again \"from heaven to deliver them from\r\nthe coming wrath.\" Moreover, they urge them not to grieve for certain\r\nmembers of the society who have already died, saying that, \"if we\r\nbelieve that Jesus died and rose again,\" we may also be assured that\r\n\"the dead in Christ will rise\" and will live for ever with Him. Thus the\r\nletter assumes that its readers already have considerable knowledge as\r\nto \"the Lord Jesus Christ,\" and as to His relation to \"God the Father,\"\r\na knowledge derived from teaching given in person on a former visit. The\r\npurpose of the letter is not to give information as to the past, but to\r\nstimulate its readers to perseverance by giving fresh teaching as to the\r\nfuture. Historically it is of great value as showing how widely within\r\ntwenty or twenty-five years of the Crucifixion a religion which\r\nproclaimed developed theological teaching as to \"the Lord Jesus Christ\"\r\nhad spread in the Roman Empire. We may draw a further conclusion from\r\nthis and other letters of St Paul before we go on. St Paul's missionary\r\nwork must have created a demand. Those who had heard him and read his\r\nletters would want to know more than he had told them of the earthly\r\nlife of the Lord Jesus. They would wish to be able to picture Him to\r\ntheir minds; and especially to understand what could have led to His\r\nbeing put to death by the Romans at the requisition of the Jews. St Paul\r\nhad not been one of his personal disciples in Galilee or Jerusalem; he\r\nhad no memories to relate of His miracles and teaching. Some written\r\naccount of these was an obvious need. And we may be sure that any such\r\nnarrative concerning One who was so deeply reverenced would be most\r\ncarefully scrutinized at a time when many were still living whose\r\nmemories went back to the period of Our Lord's public ministry. One such\r\nnarrative we now proceed to describe.\r\n\r\n2. _St Mark's Gospel._--The Gospel according to St Mark was written\r\nwithin fifteen years of the first letter of St Paul to the\r\nThessalonians--i.e. about 65. It seems designed to meet the requirements\r\nof Christians living far away from Palestine. The author was not an\r\neye-witness of what he relates, but he writes with the firm security of\r\na man who has the best authority behind him. The characteristics of his\r\nwork confirm the early belief that St Mark wrote this Gospel for the\r\nChristians of Rome under the guidance of St Peter. It is of the first\r\nimportance that we should endeavour to see this book as a whole; to gain\r\nthe total impression which it makes on the mind; to look at the picture\r\nof Jesus Christ which it offers. That picture must inevitably be an\r\nincomplete representation of Him; it will need to be supplemented by\r\nother pictures which other writers have drawn. But it is important to\r\nconsider it by itself, as showing us what impress the Master had made on\r\nthe memory of one disciple who had been almost constantly by His side.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Beginning of Christ's Mission.\r\n\r\nThe book opens thus: \"The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.\" This\r\n\"beginning\" is shown to be itself rooted in the past. Hebrew prophets\r\nhad foretold that God would send a \"messenger\"; that a voice would be\r\nheard saying, \"Prepare the way of the Lord.\" And so, in fact, John came,\r\nbaptizing in the wilderness and turning the heart of the nation back to\r\nGod. But John was only a forerunner. He was himself a prophet, and his\r\nprophecy was this, \"He that is stronger than I am is coming after me.\"\r\nThen, we read, \"Jesus came.\" St Mark introduces Him quite abruptly, just\r\nas he had introduced John; for he is writing for those who already know\r\nthe outlines of the story. \"Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee.\" He was\r\nbaptized by John, and as He came out of the water He had a vision of the\r\nopened heavens and the Holy Spirit, like a dove, descending upon Him;\r\nand He heard a Voice saying, \"Thou art My Son, the Beloved: in Thee I am\r\nwell pleased.\" He then passed away into the wilderness, where He was\r\ntempted by Satan and fed by angels. Then He begins His work; and from\r\nthe very first we feel that He fulfils John's sign: He is strong. His\r\nfirst words are words of strength; \"the time is fulfilled\"--that is to\r\nsay, all the past has been leading up to this great moment; \"the kingdom\r\nof God is at hand\"--that is to say, all your best hopes are on the point\r\nof being fulfilled; \"repent, and believe the Gospel\"--that is to say,\r\nturn from your sins and accept the tidings which I bring you. It is but\r\na brief summary of what He must have said; but we feel its strength. He\r\ndoes not hesitate to fix all eyes upon Himself. Then we see Him call two\r\nbrothers who are fishermen. \"Come after Me,\" He says, \"and I will make\r\nyou fishers of men.\" They dropped their nets and went after Him, and so\r\ndid two other brothers, their partners; for they all felt the power of\r\nthis Master of men: He was strong. He began to teach in the synagogue;\r\nthey were astonished at His teaching, for he spoke with authority. He\r\nwas interrupted by a demoniac, but He quelled the evil spirit by a word;\r\nHe was stronger than the power of evil. When the sun set the Sabbath was\r\nat an end, and the people could carry out their sick into the street\r\nwhere He was; and He came forth and healed them all. The demoniacs\r\nshowed a strange faculty of recognition, and cried that He was \"the holy\r\none of God,\" and \"the Christ,\" but He silenced them at once. The next\r\nmorning He was gone. He had sought a quiet spot for prayer. Peter, one\r\nof those fishermen whom He had called, whose wife's mother had been\r\nhealed the day before, found Him and tried to bring Him back. \"All men\r\nare seeking Thee,\" he pleaded. \"Let us go elsewhere\" was the quiet reply\r\nof one who could not be moved by popular enthusiasm. Once again, we\r\nobserve, He fulfils John's sign: He is strong. This is our first sight\r\nof Jesus Christ. The next shows us that this great strength is united to\r\na most tender sympathy. To touch a leper was forbidden, and the offence\r\ninvolved ceremonial defilement. Yet when a leper declared that Jesus\r\ncould heal him, if only He would, \"He put forth His hand and touched\r\nhim.\" The act perfected the leper's faith, and he was healed\r\nimmediately. But he disobeyed the command to be silent about the matter,\r\nand the result was that Jesus could not openly enter into the town, but\r\nremained outside in the country. It is the first shadow that falls\r\nacross His path; His power finds a check in human wilfulness. Presently\r\nHe is in Capernaum again. He heals a paralysed man, but not until He has\r\ncome into touch, as we say, with him also, by reaching his deepest need\r\nand declaring the forgiveness of his sins. This declaration disturbs the\r\nrabbis, who regard it as a blasphemous usurpation of Divine authority.\r\nBut He claims that \"the Son of Man hath authority on earth to forgive\r\nsins.\" The title which He thus adopts must be considered later.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Attitude towards Religious Tradition.\r\n\r\nWe may note, as we pass on, that He has again, in the exercise of His\r\npower and His sympathy, come into conflict with the established\r\nreligious tradition. This freedom from the trammels of convention\r\nappears yet again when he claims as a new disciple a publican, a man\r\nwhose calling as a tax-gatherer for the Roman government made him odious\r\nto every patriotic Jew. Publicans were classed with open sinners; and\r\nwhen Jesus went to this man's house and met a company of his fellows the\r\nrabbis were scandalized: \"Why eateth your Master with publicans and\r\nsinners?\" The gentle answer of Jesus showed His sympathy even with those\r\nwho opposed Him: \"The doctor,\" He said, \"must go to the sick.\" And\r\nagain, when they challenged His disciples for not observing the regular\r\nfasts, He gently reminded them that they themselves relaxed the\r\ndiscipline of fasting for a bridegroom's friends. And He added, in\r\npicturesque and pregnant sayings, that an old garment could not bear a\r\nnew patch, and that old wine-skins could not take new wine. Such\r\nlanguage was at once gentle and strong; without condemning the old, it\r\nclaimed liberty for the new. To what lengths would this liberty go? The\r\nsacred badge of the Jews' religion, which marked them off from other men\r\nall the world over, was their observance of the Sabbath. It was a\r\nnational emblem, the test of religion and patriotism. The rabbis had\r\nfenced the Sabbath round with minute commands, lest any Jews should even\r\nseem to work on the Sabbath day. Thus, plucking and rubbing the ears of\r\ncorn was counted a form of reaping and threshing. The hungry disciples\r\nhad so transgressed as they walked through the fields of ripe corn.\r\nJesus defended them by the example of David, who had eaten the\r\nshewbread, which only priests might eat, and had given it to his hungry\r\nmen. Necessity absolves from ritual restrictions. And he went farther,\r\nand proclaimed a principle: \"The Sabbath was made for man, and not man\r\nfor the Sabbath, so that the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.\"\r\nFor a second time, in justifying His position, He used the expression\r\n\"the Son of Man.\" The words might sound to Jewish ears merely as a\r\nsynonym for \"man.\" For Himself, and possibly for some others, they\r\ninvolved a reference, as appears later, to the \"one like to a son of\r\nman\" in Daniel's prophecy of the coming kingdom. They emphasized His\r\nrelation to humanity as a whole, in contrast to such narrower titles as\r\n\"Son of Abraham\" or \"Son of David.\" They were fitted to express a wider\r\nmission than that of a merely Jewish Messiah: He stood and spoke for\r\nmankind. The controversy was renewed when a man with a withered hand\r\nappeared in the synagogue on the Sabbath, and the rabbis watched to see\r\nwhether Jesus would heal him. For the first time, we read that Jesus was\r\nangry. They were wilfully blind, and they would rather not see good done\r\nthan see it done in a way that contradicted their teachings and\r\nundermined their influence. After a sharp remonstrance, He healed the\r\nman by a mere word. And they went out to make a compact with the\r\nfollowers of the worldly Herod to kill Him, and so to stave off a\r\nreligious revolution which might easily have been followed by political\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Recapitulation.\r\n\r\nUp to this point what have we seen? On the stage of Palestine, an\r\noutlying district of the Roman Empire, the home of the Jewish nation,\r\nnow subject but still fired with the hope of freedom and even of\r\nuniversal domination under the leadership of a divinely anointed King, a\r\nnew figure has appeared. His appearance has been announced by a\r\nreforming prophet, who has summoned the nation to return to its God, and\r\npromised that a stronger than himself is to follow. In fulfilment of\r\nthis promise, who is it that has come? Not a rough prophet in the desert\r\nlike John, not a leader striking for political freedom, not a pretender\r\naiming at the petty throne of the Herods, not even a great rabbi,\r\nbuilding on the patriotic foundation of the Pharisees who had secured\r\nthe national life by a new devotion to the ancient law. None of these,\r\nbut, on the contrary, an unknown figure from the remote hills of\r\nGalilee, standing on the populous shores of its lake, proclaiming as a\r\nmessage from God that the highest hopes were about to be fulfilled,\r\nfastening attention on Himself by speaking with authority and attaching\r\na few followers to His person, exhibiting wonderful powers of healing as\r\na sign that He has come to fulfil all needs, manifesting at the same\r\ntime an unparalleled sympathy, and setting quietly aside every religious\r\nconvention which limited the outflow of this sympathy; and as the result\r\nof all this arousing the enthusiasm of astonished multitudes and evoking\r\nthe opposition and even the murderous resentment of the religious guides\r\nof the nation. Of His teaching we have heard nothing, except in the\r\noccasional sentences by which He justified some of His unexpected\r\nactions. No party is formed, no programme is announced, no doctrine is\r\nformulated; without assuming the title of Messiah, He offers Himself as\r\nthe centre of expectation, and seems to invite an unlimited confidence\r\nin His person. This, then, in brief summary, is what we have seen: the\r\nnatural development of an historical situation, a march of events\r\nleading rapidly to a climax; an unexampled strength and an unexampled\r\nsympathy issuing inevitably in an unexampled liberty; and then the\r\nforces of orthodox religion combining with the forces of worldly\r\nindifference in order to suppress a dangerous innovator. Yet the writer\r\nwho in a few pages presents us with so remarkable a representation shows\r\nno consciousness at all of artistic treatment. He tells a simple tale in\r\nthe plainest words: he never stops to offer a comment or to point a\r\nmoral. The wonder of it all is not in the writing, but in the subject\r\nitself. We feel that we have here no skilful composition, but a bare\r\ntranscript of what occurred. And we feel besides that such a narrative\r\nas this is the worthy commencement of an answer to the question with\r\nwhich its readers would have come to it: What was the beginning of the\r\nGospel? How did the Lord Jesus speak and act? and why did He arouse such\r\nmalignant enmity amongst His own people?\r\n\r\nWe have followed St Mark's narrative up to the point at which it became\r\nclear that conciliatory argument could have no effect upon the Jewish\r\nreligious leaders. The controversy about the Sabbath had brought their\r\ndissatisfaction to a climax. Henceforth Jesus was to them a\r\nrevolutionary, who must, by any means, be suppressed. After this\r\ndecisive breach a new period opens. Jesus leaves Capernaum, never again,\r\nit would seem, to appear in its synagogue. Henceforward He was to be\r\nfound, with His disciples, on the shore of the lake, where vast\r\nmultitudes gathered round Him, drawn not only from Galilee and Judaea,\r\nbut also from the farther districts north and east of these. He would\r\ntake refuge from the crowds in a boat, which carried Him from shore to\r\nshore; and His healing activity was now at its height. Yet in the midst\r\nof this popular enthusiasm He knew that the time had come to prepare for\r\na very different future, and accordingly a fresh departure was made when\r\nHe selected twelve of His disciples for a more intimate companionship,\r\nwith a view to a special mission: \"He appointed twelve that they might\r\nbe with Him, and that He might send them forth to preach and to have\r\npower to cast out the devils.\" The excitement and pressure of the crowds\r\nwas at this time almost overwhelming, and the relatives of Jesus\r\nendeavoured to restrain Him; \"for they said, He is mad.\" The scribes\r\nfrom Jerusalem offered a more sinister explanation, saying that He was\r\npossessed by the prince of the devils, and that this was why He was able\r\nto control all the evil spirits. He answered them first in figurative\r\nlanguage, speaking of the certain downfall of a kingdom or a family\r\ndivided against itself, and of the strong man's house which could not be\r\nlooted unless the strong man were first bound. Then followed the\r\ntremendous warning, that to assign His work to Satan, and so to call\r\ngood evil, was to blaspheme against the Holy Spirit--the one sin which\r\nadmitted of no forgiveness. Presently, when He was told that His mother\r\nand brethren were calling for Him, He disclaimed their interference by\r\npointing to a new circle of family relationship, consisting of all those\r\nwho \"do the will of God.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Christ's Teaching.\r\n\r\nAgain we find Him teaching by the lake, and the pressure of the\r\nmultitude is still so great that He sits in a boat while they line the\r\nshore. For the first time we are allowed to hear how He taught them. He\r\ngives them a parable from nature--the sower's three kinds of failure,\r\ncompensated by the rich produce of the good soil. At the close He utters\r\nthe pregnant saying: \"He that hath ears to hear let him hear.\" When His\r\ndisciples afterwards asked for an explanation, He prefaced it by saying\r\nthat the inner circle only were intended to understand. The disciples\r\nmight learn that the message would often prove fruitless, but that\r\nnevertheless an abundant harvest would result. For the light was\r\nintended to shine, and the hidden was meant to be revealed. Another\r\nparable compared the kingdom of God to seed which, when once planted,\r\nmust inevitably germinate; the process was secret and slow, but the\r\nharvest was certain. Again, it was like the tiny mustard-seed which grew\r\nout of all proportion to its original size, till the birds could shelter\r\nin its great branches. These enigmatic speeches were all that the\r\nmultitudes got, but the disciples in private were taught their lesson of\r\nhope. As we review this teaching it is very remarkable. The world of\r\ncommon things is seen to be a lesson-book of the kingdom of God to those\r\nwho have eyes to read it. What that kingdom is to be we are not told; we\r\nare only taught that its coming is secret, slow and certain. If nature\r\nin its ordinary processes was thus seen to be full of significance, the\r\ndisciples were also to learn that it was under His control. As the boat\r\nfrom which He had been teaching passed to the other side, the tired\r\nTeacher slept. A sudden storm terrified the disciples, and they roused\r\nHim in alarm. He stilled the storm with a word and rebuked their want of\r\nfaith. \"Who then is this,\" they whispered with awe, \"that even the wind\r\nand the sea obey Him?\" On the opposite hills a solitary spectator had\r\nwatched the rise and the lull of the tempest, a fierce demoniac who\r\ndwelt among the tombs on the mountain-side. He believed himself to be\r\npossessed by a regiment of demons. When Jesus bade them go forth, he\r\nbegged that they might be allowed to enter into a herd of swine which\r\nwas hard by. His request was granted, and the swine rushed over a steep\r\nplace into the lake. It is worth while to note that while most of the\r\ncures which Jesus had performed appear to have belonged to this class,\r\nthis particular case is described as an exceptionally severe one, and\r\nthe visible effect of the removal of his tormentors may have greatly\r\nhelped to restore the man's shattered personality.\r\n\r\nWe must not attempt to trace in detail the whole of St Mark's story. We\r\nhave followed it long enough to see its directness and simplicity, to\r\nobserve the naturalness with which one incident succeeds another, and to\r\nwatch the gradual manifestation of a personality at once strong and\r\nsympathetic, wielding extraordinary powers, which are placed wholly at\r\nthe service of others, and refusing to be hindered from helping men by\r\nthe ordinary restrictions of social or religious custom. And we have\r\nseen as the consequence of all this the development of an historical\r\nsituation in which the leaders of current orthodoxy ally themselves with\r\nthe indifferentism which accepts existing political conditions in order\r\nto put down a disturber of the peace. We must now be content with a\r\nbroader survey of the course of events.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Healing Powers.\r\n\r\nTwo notable cures were wrought on the western side of the lake--the\r\nhealing of the woman with the issue and the raising of Jairus's\r\ndaughter. In each of these cures prominence is given to the requirement\r\nand the reward of faith--that is to say, of personal confidence in the\r\nHealer: \"Thy faith hath made thee whole.\" \"Fear not, only believe.\"\r\nAfter this Jesus passed away from the enthusiastic crowds by the lake to\r\nvisit His own Nazareth, and to find there a strange incredulity in\r\nregard to one whom the villagers knew as the carpenter. Once more we\r\ncome across a mysterious limitation of His powers: \"He could not do\r\nthere any miracle,\" save the cure of a few sick folk; and He marvelled\r\nbecause of their want of faith. The moment had now come when the twelve\r\ndisciples were to be entrusted with a share of His healing power and\r\nwith the proclamation of repentance. While they are journeying two and\r\ntwo in various directions St Mark takes occasion to tell us the current\r\nconjectures as to who Jesus really was. Some thought him Elijah or one\r\nof the ancient prophets returned to earth--a suggestion based on popular\r\ntradition; others said He was John the Baptist risen from the dead--the\r\nsuperstition of Herod who had put him to death. When the disciples\r\nreturned, Jesus took them apart for rest; but the crowds reassembled\r\nwhen they found Him again near the lake, and His yearning compassion for\r\nthese shepherdless sheep led Him to give them an impressive sign that He\r\nhad indeed come to supply all human needs. Hitherto His power had gone\r\nforth to individuals, but now He fed five thousand men from the scanty\r\nstock of five loaves and two fishes. That night He came to His disciples\r\nwalking upon the waters, and in the period which immediately followed\r\nthere was once more a great manifestation of healing power.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Opposition of the Scribes.\r\n\r\nWe have heard nothing for some time of any opposition; but now a fresh\r\nconflict arose with certain scribes who had come down from Jerusalem,\r\nand who complained that the disciples neglected the ceremonial washing\r\nof their hands before meals. Jesus replied with a stern rebuke,\r\naddressing the questioners as hypocrites, and exposing the falsity of a\r\nsystem which allowed the breach of fundamental commandments in order\r\nthat traditional regulations might be observed. He then turned from them\r\nto the multitude, and uttered a saying which in effect annulled the\r\nJewish distinction between clean and unclean meats. This was a direct\r\nattack on the whole Pharisaic position. The controversy was plainly\r\nirreconcilable, and Jesus withdrew to the north, actually passing\r\noutside the limits of the Holy Land. He desired to remain unknown, and\r\nnot to extend His mission to the heathen population, but the\r\nextraordinary faith and the modest importunity of a Syrophenician woman\r\ninduced Him to heal her daughter. Then He returned by a circuitous route\r\nto the Sea of Galilee. His return was marked by another miraculous\r\nfeeding of the multitude, and also by two healing miracles which present\r\nunusual features. In both the patient was withdrawn from the multitude\r\nand the cure was wrought with the accompaniment of symbolic actions.\r\nMoreover, in one case Jesus is described as groaning before He spoke; in\r\nthe other the cure was at first incomplete; and both of the men were\r\nstrictly charged to observe silence afterwards. It cannot be a mere\r\ncoincidence that these are the last cures which St Mark records as\r\nperformed in Galilee.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Messianic Teaching.\r\n\r\nIn fact the Galilean ministry is now closed. Jesus retires northwards to\r\nCaesarea Philippi, and appears henceforth to devote Himself entirely to\r\nthe instruction of his disciples, who needed to be prepared for the\r\nfatal issue which could not long be delayed. He begins by asking them\r\nthe popular opinion as to His Person. The suggestions are still the\r\nsame--John the Baptist, or Elijah, or some other of the prophets. But\r\nwhen He asked their own belief, Peter replied, \"Thou art the Christ.\" He\r\nwarned them not to make this known; and He proceeded to give them the\r\nwholly new teaching that the Son of Man must suffer and be killed,\r\nadding that after three days He must rise again. Peter took Him aside\r\nand urged Him not to speak so. But He turned to the other disciples and\r\nopenly rebuked Peter. And then, addressing a yet wider circle, He\r\ndemanded of those who should follow Him a self-sacrifice like His own.\r\nHe even used the metaphor of the cross which was carried by the sufferer\r\nto the place of execution. Life, he declared, could only be saved by\r\nvoluntary death. He went on to demand an unswerving loyalty to Himself\r\nand His teaching in the face of a threatening world; and then He\r\npromised that some of those who were present should not die before they\r\nhad seen the coming of the kingdom of God. We have had no hint of such\r\nteaching as this in the whole of the Galilean ministry. Jesus had stood\r\nforth as the strong healer and helper of men; it was bewildering to hear\r\nHim speak of dying. He had promised to fulfil men's highest\r\nexpectations, if only they would not doubt His willingness and power. He\r\nhad been enthusiastically reverenced by the common people, though\r\nsuspected and attacked by the religious leaders. He had spoken of \"the\r\nwill of God\" as supreme, and had set aside ceremonial traditions. He had\r\nannounced the nearness of the kingdom of God, but had described it only\r\nin parables from nature. He had adopted the vague title of the \"Son of\r\nMan,\" but had refrained from proclaiming Himself as the expected\r\nMessiah. At last the disciples had expressed their conviction that He\r\nwas the Christ, and immediately He tells them that He goes to meet\r\nhumiliation and death as the necessary steps to a resurrection and a\r\ncoming of the Son of Man in the glory of His Father. It was an amazing\r\nannouncement and He plainly added that their path like His own lay\r\nthrough death to life. The dark shadows of this picture of the future\r\nalone could impress their minds, but a week later three of them were\r\nallowed a momentary vision of the light which should overcome the\r\ndarkness. They saw Jesus transfigured in a radiance of glory: Elijah\r\nappeared with Moses, and they talked with Jesus. A cloud came over them,\r\nand a Voice, like that of the Baptism, proclaimed \"This is My Son, the\r\nBeloved: hear ye Him.\" They were bidden to keep the vision secret till\r\nthe Son of Man should have risen from the dead. It was in itself a\r\nforetaste of resurrection, and the puzzled disciples remembered that the\r\nscribes declared that before the resurrection Elijah would appear. Their\r\nminds were confused as to what resurrection was meant. Jesus told them\r\nthat Elijah had in fact come; and He also said that the Scriptures\r\nforetold the sufferings of the Son of Man. But the situation was wholly\r\nbeyond their grasp, and the very language of St Mark at this point seems\r\nto reflect the confusion of their minds.\r\n\r\nThe other disciples, in the meantime, had been vainly endeavouring to\r\ncure a peculiarly violent case of demoniacal possession. Jesus Himself\r\ncast out the demon, but not before the suffering child had been rendered\r\nseemingly lifeless by a final assault. Then they journeyed secretly\r\nthrough Galilee towards Judaea and the eastern side of the Jordan. On\r\nthe way Jesus reinforced the new lesson of self-renunciation. He offered\r\nthe little children as the type of those to whom the kingdom of God\r\nbelonged; and He disappointed a young and wealthy aspirant to His\r\nfavour, amazing His disciples by saying that the kingdom of God could\r\nhardly be entered by the rich; he who forsook all should have all, and\r\nmore than all; the world's estimates were to be reversed--the first\r\nshould be last and the last first. They were now journeying towards\r\nJerusalem, and the prediction of the Passion was repeated. James and\r\nJohn, who had witnessed the Transfiguration, and who were confident of\r\nthe coming glory, asked for the places nearest to their Master, and\r\nprofessed their readiness to share His sufferings. When the other ten\r\nwere aggrieved Jesus declared that greatness was measured by service,\r\nnot by rank; and that the Son of Man had come not to be served but to\r\nserve, and to give His life to ransom many other lives. As they came up\r\nfrom the Jordan valley and passed through Jericho, an incident occurred\r\nwhich signalized the beginning of the final period. A blind man appealed\r\nto Jesus as \"the Son of David,\" and was answered by the restoration of\r\nhis sight; and when, a little later, Jesus fulfilled an ancient prophecy\r\nby mounting an ass and riding into Jerusalem, the multitudes snouted\r\ntheir welcome to the returning \"kingdom of David.\" Hitherto He had not\r\npermitted any public recognition of His Messiahship, but now He entered\r\nDavid's city in lowly but significant pomp as David's promised heir.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Entry into Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nTwo incidents illustrate the spirit of judgment with which He approached\r\nthe splendid but apostate city. On His arrival He had carefully observed\r\nthe condition of the Temple, and had retired to sleep outside the city.\r\nOn the following morning, finding no fruit on a fig-tree in full leaf,\r\nHe said, \"Let no man eat fruit of thee henceforth for ever.\" It was a\r\nparable of impending doom. Then, when He entered the Temple, He swept\r\naway with a fiery zeal the merchants and merchandise which had turned\r\nGod's House into \"a robbers' den.\" The act was at once an assertion of\r\ncommanding authority and an open condemnation of the religious rulers\r\nwho had permitted the desecration. Its immediate effect was to make new\r\nand powerful enemies; for the chief priests, as well as their rivals the\r\nscribes, were now inflamed against Him. At the moment they could do\r\nnothing, but the next day they formally demanded whence He derived His\r\nright so to act. When they refused to answer His question as to the\r\nauthority of John the Baptist, He in turn refused to tell them His own.\r\nBut He uttered a parable which more than answered them. The owner of the\r\nvineyard, who had sent his servants and last of all his only son, would\r\nvisit their rejection and murder on the wicked husbandmen. He added a\r\nreminder that the stone which the builders refused was, after all, the\r\nDivine choice. They were restrained from arresting Him by fear of the\r\npeople, to whom the meaning of the parable was plain. They therefore\r\nsent a joint deputation of Pharisees and Herodians to entrap Him with a\r\nquestion as to the Roman tribute, in answering which He must either lose\r\nHis influence with the people or else lay Himself open to a charge of\r\ntreason. When they were baffled, the Sadducees, to whose party the chief\r\npriests belonged, sought in vain to pose Him with a problem as to the\r\nresurrection of the dead; and after that a more honest scribe confessed\r\nthe truth of His teaching as to the supremacy of love to God and man\r\nover all the sacrificial worship of the Temple, and was told in reply\r\nthat he was not far from the kingdom of God. Jesus Himself now put a\r\nquestion as to the teaching of the scribes which identified the Messiah\r\nwith \"the Son of David\"; and then He denounced those scribes whose pride\r\nand extortion and hypocrisy were preparing for them a terrible doom.\r\nBefore He left the Temple, never to return, one incident gave Him pure\r\nsatisfaction. His own teaching that all must be given for God was\r\nillustrated by the devotion of a poor widow who cast into the treasury\r\nthe two tiny coins which were all that she had. As He passed out He\r\nforetold, in words which corresponded to the doom of the fig-tree, the\r\nutter demolition of the imposing but profitless Temple; and presently He\r\nopened up to four of His disciples a vision of the future, warning them\r\nagainst false Christs, bidding them expect great sorrows, national and\r\npersonal, declaring that the gospel must be proclaimed to all the\r\nnations, and that after a great tribulation the Son of Man should\r\nappear, \"coming with the clouds of heaven.\" The day and the hour none\r\nknew, neither the angels nor the Son, but only the Father: it was the\r\nduty of all to watch.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Final Scenes.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the final scenes. The passover was approaching, and plots\r\nwere being laid for His destruction. He Himself spoke mysteriously of\r\nHis burial, when a woman poured a vase of costly ointment upon His head.\r\nTo some this seemed a wasteful act; but He accepted it as a token of the\r\nlove which gave all that was in its power, and He promised that it\r\nshould never cease to illustrate His Gospel. Two of the disciples were\r\nsent into Jerusalem to prepare the Passover meal. During the meal Jesus\r\ndeclared that He should be betrayed by one of their number. Later in the\r\nevening He gave them bread and wine, proclaiming that these were His\r\nbody and His blood--the tokens of His giving Himself to them, and of a\r\nnew covenant with God through His death. As they withdrew to the Mount\r\nof Olives He foretold their general flight, but promised that when He\r\nwas risen He would go before them into Galilee. Peter protested\r\nfaithfulness unto death, but was told that he would deny his Master\r\nthree times that very night. Then coming to a place called Gethsemane,\r\nHe bade the disciples wait while He should pray; and taking the three\r\nwho had been with Him at the Transfiguration He told them to tarry near\r\nHim and to watch. He went forward, and fell on the ground, praying that\r\n\"the cup might be taken away\" from Him, but resigning Himself to His\r\nFather's will. Presently Judas arrived with a band of armed men, and\r\ngreeted his Master with a kiss--the signal for His arrest. The disciples\r\nfled in panic, after one of them had wounded the high priest's servant.\r\nOnly a nameless young man tried to follow, but he too fled when hands\r\nwere laid upon him. Before the high priest Jesus was charged, among\r\nother accusations, with threatening to destroy the Temple; but the\r\nmatter was brought to an issue when He was plainly asked if He were \"the\r\nChrist, the Son of the Blessed One.\" He answered that He was, and He\r\npredicted that they should see the fulfilment of Daniel's vision of the\r\nSon of Man sitting on the right hand of power. Thereupon He was\r\ncondemned to death for manifest blasphemy, and a scene of cruel mockery\r\nfollowed. Meanwhile Peter in the court below had been sitting with the\r\nservants, and in his anxiety to escape recognition had thrice declared\r\nthat he did not know Jesus. Thus the night passed, and in the morning\r\nJesus was taken to Pilate, for the Jewish council had no power to\r\nexecute their decree of death. Pilate's question, \"Art Thou the King of\r\nthe Jews?\" shows the nature of the accusation which was thought likely\r\nto tell with the Roman governor. He had already in bonds one leader of\r\nrevolution, whose hands were stained with blood--a striking contrast to\r\nthe calm and silent figure who stood before him. At this moment a crowd\r\ncame up to ask the fulfilment of his annual act of grace, the pardon of\r\na prisoner at the Passover. Pilate, discerning that it was the envy of\r\nthe rulers which sought to destroy an inconvenient rival, offered \"the\r\nKing of the Jews\" as the prisoner to be released. But the chief priests\r\nsucceeded in making the people ask for Barabbas and demand the\r\ncrucifixion of Jesus. Pilate fulfilled his pledge by giving them the man\r\nof their choice, and Jesus, whom he had vainly hoped to release on a\r\nsatisfactory pretext, he now condemned to the shameful punishments of\r\nscourging and crucifixion; for the cross, as Jesus had foreseen, was the\r\ninevitable fate of a Jewish pretender to sovereignty. The Roman soldiers\r\nmocked \"the King of the Jews\" with a purple robe and a crown of thorns.\r\nAs they led Him out they forced the cross, which the sufferer commonly\r\ncarried, upon the shoulders of one Simon of Cyrene, whose son's\r\nAlexander and Rufus are here mentioned--probably as being known to St\r\nMark's readers; at any rate, it is interesting to note that, in writing\r\nto the Christians at Rome, St Paul a few years earlier had sent a\r\ngreeting to \"Rufus and his mother.\" Over the cross, which stood between\r\ntwo others, was the condemnatory inscription, \"The King of the Jews.\"\r\nThis was the Roman designation of Him whom the Jewish rulers tauntingly\r\naddressed as \"the King of Israel.\" The same revilers, with a deeper\r\ntruth than they knew, summed up the mystery of His life and death when\r\nthey said, \"He saved others, Himself He cannot save.\"\r\n\r\nA great darkness shrouded the scene for three hours, and then, in His\r\nnative Aramaic, Jesus cried in the words of the Psalm, \"My God, My God,\r\nwhy has Thou forsaken Me?\" One other cry He uttered, and the end came,\r\nand at that moment the veil of the Temple was rent from top to\r\nbottom--an omen of fearful import to those who had mocked Him, even on\r\nthe cross, as the destroyer of the Temple, who in three days should\r\nbuild it anew. The disciples of Jesus do not appear as spectators of the\r\nend, but only a group of women who had ministered to His needs in\r\nGalilee, and had followed Him up to Jerusalem. These women watched His\r\nburial, which was performed by a Jewish councillor, to whom Pilate had\r\ngranted the body after the centurion had certified the reality of the\r\nunexpectedly early death. The body was placed in a rock-hewn tomb, and a\r\ngreat stone was rolled against the entrance. Sunset brought on the\r\nJewish sabbath, but the next evening the women brought spices to anoint\r\nthe body, and at sunrise on the third day they arrived at the tomb, and\r\nsaw that the stone was rolled away. They entered and found a young man\r\nin a white robe, who said, \"He is risen, He is not here,\" and bade them\r\nsay to His disciples and Peter, \"He goeth before you into Galilee; there\r\nye shall see Him, as He said unto you.\" In terror they fled from the\r\ntomb, \"and they said nothing to any man, for they feared....\"\r\n\r\nSo with a broken sentence the narrative ends. The document is imperfect,\r\nowing probably to the accidental loss of its last leaf. In very early\r\ntimes attempts were made to furnish it with a fitting close; but neither\r\nof the supplements which we find in manuscripts can be regarded as\r\ncoming from the original writer. If we ask what must, on grounds of\r\nliterary probability, have been added before the record was closed, we\r\nmay content ourselves here with saying that some incident must certainly\r\nhave been narrated which should have realized the twice-repeated promise\r\nthat Jesus would be seen by His disciples in Galilee.\r\n\r\n3. _Document used by St Matthew and St Luke._--We pass on now to compare\r\nwith this narrative of St Mark another very early document which no\r\nlonger exists in an independent form, but which can be partially\r\nreconstructed from the portions of it which have been embodied in the\r\nGospels of St Matthew and St Luke.\r\n\r\nWhen we review St Mark's narrative as a whole we are struck, first of\r\nall, with its directness and simplicity. It moves straightforward upon a\r\nwell-defined path. It shows us the Lord Jesus entering on the mission\r\npredicted by the Baptist without declaring Himself to be the Messiah;\r\nattracting the multitudes in Galilee by His healing power and His\r\nunbounded sympathy, and at the same time awakening the envy and\r\nsuspicion of the leaders of religion; training a few disciples till they\r\nreach the conviction that He is the Christ, and then, but not till then,\r\nadmitting them into the secret of His coming sufferings, and preparing\r\nthem for a mission in which they also must sacrifice themselves; then\r\njourneying to Jerusalem to fulfil the destiny which He foresaw,\r\naccepting the responsibility of the Messianic title, only to be\r\ncondemned by the religious authorities as a blasphemer and handed over\r\nto the Roman power as a pretender to the Jewish throne. That is the\r\nstory in its barest outline. It is adequate to its presumed purpose of\r\noffering to distant Gentile converts a clear account of their Master's\r\nearthly work, and of the causes which led to His rejection by His own\r\npeople and to His death by Roman crucifixion. The writer makes no\r\ncomment on the wonderful story which he tells. Allusions to Jewish\r\ncustoms are, indeed, explained as they occur, but apart from this the\r\nnarrative appears to be a mere transcript of remembered facts. The\r\nactors are never characterized; their actions are simply noted down;\r\nthere is no praise and no blame. To this simplicity and directness of\r\nnarrative we may in large measure attribute the fact that when two later\r\nevangelists desired to give fuller accounts of our Lord's life they both\r\nmade this early book the basis of their work. In those days there was no\r\nsense of unfairness in using up existing materials in order to make a\r\nmore complete treatise. Accordingly so much of St Mark's Gospel has been\r\ntaken over word for word in the Gospels of St Luke and St Matthew that,\r\nif every copy of it had perished, we could still reconstruct large\r\nportions of it by carefully comparing their narratives. They did not\r\nhesitate, however, to alter St Mark's language where it seemed to them\r\nrough or obscure, for each of them had a distinctive style of his own,\r\nand St Luke was a literary artist of a high order. Moreover, though they\r\nboth accepted the general scheme of St Mark's narrative, each of them\r\nwas obliged to omit many incidents in order to find room for other\r\nmaterial which was at their disposal, by which they were able to\r\nsupplement the deficiencies of the earlier book. The most conspicuous\r\ndeficiency was in regard to our Lord's teaching, of which, as we have\r\nseen, St Mark had given surprisingly little. Here they were happily in a\r\nposition to make a very important contribution.\r\n\r\nFor side by side with St Mark's Gospel there was current in the earliest\r\ntimes another account of the doings and sayings of Jesus Christ. Our\r\nknowledge of it to-day is entirely derived from a comparison of the two\r\nlater evangelists who embodied large portions of it, working it in and\r\nout of the general scheme which they derived from St Mark, according as\r\neach of them thought most appropriate. St Luke appears to have taken it\r\nover in sections for the most part without much modification; but in St\r\nMatthew's Gospel its incidents seldom find an independent place; the\r\nsayings to which they gave rise are often detached from their context\r\nand grouped with sayings of a similar character so as to form\r\nconsiderable discourses, or else they are linked on to sayings which\r\nwere uttered on other occasions recorded by St Mark. It is probable that\r\nmany passages of St Luke's Gospel which have no parallel in St Matthew\r\nwere also derived from this early source; but this is not easily capable\r\nof distinct proof; and, therefore, in order to gain a secure conception\r\nof the document we must confine ourselves at first to those parts of it\r\nwhich were borrowed by both writers. We shall, however, look to St Luke\r\nin the main as preserving for us the more nearly its original form.\r\n\r\nWe proceed now to give an outline of the contents of this document. To\r\nbegin with, it contained a fuller account of the teaching of John the\r\nBaptist. St Mark tells us only his message of hope; but here we read the\r\nseverer language with which he called men to repentance. We hear his\r\nwarning of \"the coming wrath\": his mighty Successor will baptize with\r\nfire; the fruitless tree will be cast into the fire; the chaff will be\r\nseparated from the wheat and burned with unquenchable fire; the claim to\r\nbe children of Abraham will not avail, for God can raise up other\r\nchildren to Abraham, if it be from the stones of the desert. Next, we\r\nhave a narrative of the Temptation, of which St Mark had but recorded\r\nthe bare fact. It was grounded on the Divine sonship, which we already\r\nknow was proclaimed at the Baptism. In a threefold vision Jesus is\r\ninvited to enter upon His inheritance at once; to satisfy His own needs,\r\nto accept of earthly dominion, to presume on the Divine protection. The\r\npassage stands almost alone as a revelation of inner conflict in a life\r\nwhich outwardly was marked by unusual calm.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Sermon on the Mount.\r\n\r\nNot far from the beginning of the document there stood a remarkable\r\ndiscourse delivered among the hills above the lake. It opens with a\r\nstartling reversal of the common estimates of happiness and misery. In\r\nthe light of the coming kingdom it proclaims the blessedness of the\r\npoor, the hungry, the sad and the maligned; and the woefulness of the\r\nrich, the full, the merry and the popular. It goes on to reverse the\r\nordinary maxims of conduct. Enemies are to be loved, helped, blessed,\r\nprayed for. No blow is to be returned; every demand, just or unjust, is\r\nto be granted: in short, \"as ye desire that men should do to you, do in\r\nlike manner to them.\" Then the motive and the model of this conduct are\r\nadduced: \"Love your enemies ... and ye shall be sons of the Highest; for\r\nHe is kind to the thankless and wicked. Be merciful, as your Father is\r\nmerciful; and judge not, and ye shall not be judged.\" We note in passing\r\nthat this is the first introduction of our Lord's teaching of the\r\nfatherhood of God. God is your Father, He says in effect; you will be\r\nHis sons if like Him you will refuse to make distinctions, loving\r\nwithout looking for a return, sure that in the end love will not be\r\nwholly lost. Then follow grave warnings--generous towards others, you\r\nmust be strict with yourselves; only the good can truly do good; hearers\r\nof these words must be doers also, if they would build on the rock and\r\nnot on the sand. So, with the parable of the two builders, the discourse\r\nreached its formal close.\r\n\r\nIt was followed by the entry of Jesus into Capernaum, where He was asked\r\nto heal the servant of a Roman officer. This man's unusual faith, based\r\non his soldierly sense of discipline, surprised the Lord, who declared\r\nthat it had no equal in Israel itself. Somewhat later messengers arrived\r\nfrom the imprisoned Baptist, who asked if Jesus were indeed \"the coming\r\nOne\" of whom he had spoken. Jesus pointed to His acts of healing the\r\nsick, raising the dead and proclaiming good news for the poor; thereby\r\nsuggesting to those who could understand that He fulfilled the ancient\r\nprophecy of the Messiah. He then declared the greatness of John in\r\nexalted terms, adding, however, that the least in the kingdom of God was\r\nJohn's superior. Then He complained of the unreasonableness of an age\r\nwhich refused John as too austere and Himself as too lax and as being\r\n\"the friend of publicans and sinners.\" This narrative clearly\r\npresupposes a series of miracles already performed, and also such a\r\nconflict with the Pharisees as we have seen recorded by St Mark.\r\nPresently we find an offer of discipleship met by the warning that \"the\r\nSon of Man\" is a homeless wanderer; and then the stern refusal of a\r\nrequest for leave to perform a father's funeral rites.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Other Sayings of Jesus.\r\n\r\nClose upon these incidents follows a special mission of disciples,\r\nintroduced by the saying: \"The harvest is great, but the labourers are\r\nfew.\" The disciples as they journey are to take no provisions, but to\r\nthrow themselves on the bounty of their hearers; they are to heal the\r\nsick and to proclaim the nearness of the kingdom of God. The city that\r\nrejects them shall have a less lenient judgment than Sodom; Tyre and\r\nSidon shall be better off than cities like Chorazin and Bethsaida which\r\nhave seen His miracles; Capernaum, favoured above all, shall sink to the\r\ndeepest depth. If words could be sterner than these, they are those\r\nwhich follow: \"He that heareth you heareth Me; and he that rejecteth you\r\nrejecteth Me; but He that rejecteth Me rejecteth Him that sent Me.\" This\r\nreference to His own personal mission is strikingly expanded in words\r\nwhich He uttered on the return of the disciples. After thanking the\r\nFather for revealing to babes what He hides from the wise, He continued\r\nin mysterious language: \"All things are delivered to Me by My Father;\r\nand none knoweth who the Son is but the Father; and who the Father is\r\nbut the Son, and he to whom the Son chooseth to reveal Him.\" Happy were\r\nthe disciples in seeing and hearing what prophets and kings had looked\r\nfor in vain.\r\n\r\nWhen His disciples, having watched Him at prayer, desired to be taught\r\nhow to pray, they were bidden to address God as \"Father\"; to ask first\r\nfor the hallowing of the Father's name, and the coming of His kingdom;\r\nthen for their daily food, for the pardon of their sins and for freedom\r\nfrom temptation. It was the prayer of a family--that the sons might be\r\ntrue to the Father, and the Father true to the sons; and they were\r\nfurther encouraged by a parable of the family: \"Ask and ye shall\r\nreceive.... Every one that asketh receiveth\": for the heavenly Father\r\nwill do more, not less, than an earthly father would do for his\r\nchildren. After He had cast out a dumb demon, some said that His power\r\nwas due to Beelzebub. He accordingly asked them by whom the Jews\r\nthemselves cast out demons; and He claimed that His power was a sign\r\nthat the kingdom of God was come. But He warned them that demons cast\r\nout once might return in greater force. When they asked for a sign from\r\nheaven, He would give them no more than the sign of Jonah, explaining\r\nthat the repentant Ninevites should condemn the present generation: so,\r\ntoo, should the queen of Sheba; for that which they were now rejecting\r\nwas more than Jonah and more than Solomon. Yet further warnings were\r\ngiven when a Pharisee invited Him to his table, and expressed surprise\r\nthat He did not wash His hands before the meal. The cleansing of\r\nexternals and the tithing of garden-produce, He declares, have usurped\r\nthe place of judgment and the love of God. Woe is pronounced upon the\r\nPharisees: they are successors to the murderers of the prophets. Then\r\nciting from Genesis and 2 Chronicles, the first and last books in the\r\norder of the Jewish Bible, He declared that all righteous blood from\r\nthat of Abel to that of Zachariah should be required of that generation.\r\nAfter this the disciples are encouraged not to fear their murderous\r\nopponents. The very sparrows are God's care--much more shall they be;\r\nthe hairs of their head are all counted. In the end the Son of Man will\r\nopenly own those who have owned Him before men. For earthly needs no\r\nthought is to be taken: the birds and the flowers make no provision for\r\ntheir life and beauty. God will give food and raiment to those who are\r\nseeking His kingdom. Earthly goods should be given away in exchange for\r\nthe imperishable treasures. Suddenly will the Son of Man come: happy the\r\nservant whom His Master finds at his appointed task. In brief parables\r\nthe kingdom of God is likened to a mustard-seed and to leaven. When\r\nJesus is asked if the saved shall be few, He replies that the door is a\r\nnarrow one. Then, changing His illustration, He says that many shall\r\nseek entrance in vain; for the master of the house will refuse to\r\nrecognize them. But while they are excluded, a multitude from all\r\nquarters of the earth shall sit down with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and\r\nthe prophets in the kingdom of God.\r\n\r\nHis eyes are now fixed on Jerusalem, where, like the prophets, He must\r\ndie. \"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often have I desired to gather thy\r\nchildren together, as a bird her brood beneath her wings, but ye\r\nrefused.\" \"Ye shall not see Me, until ye shall say, Blessed is He that\r\ncometh in the name of the Lord.\" After this we have the healing of a\r\ndropsical man on the Sabbath, with a reply to the murmuring Pharisees;\r\nand then a parable of the failure of invited guests and the filling of\r\ntheir places from the streets. A few fragmentary passages remain, of\r\nwhich it will be sufficient to cite a word or two to call them to\r\nremembrance. There is a warning that he who forsakes not father and\r\nmother cannot be a disciple, nor he who does not bear his cross.\r\nSavourless salt is fit for nothing. The lost sheep is brought home with\r\na special joy. \"Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.\" Scandals must arise,\r\nbut woe to him through whom they arise. The Son of Man will come with\r\nthe suddenness of lightning; the days of Noah and the days of Lot will\r\nfind a parallel in their blind gaiety and their inevitable disaster. He\r\nwho seeks to gain his life will lose it. \"One shall be taken, and the\r\nother left.\" \"Where the carcase is, the vultures will gather.\" Then,\r\nlastly, we have a parable of the servant who failed to employ the money\r\nentrusted to him; and a promise that the disciples shall sit on twelve\r\nthrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel. We cannot say by our\r\npresent method of determination, how this document closed; for in the\r\nnarratives of the Passion and the Resurrection St Matthew and St Luke\r\nonly coincide in passages which they have taken from St Mark.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Comparison with St Mark.\r\n\r\nNow that we have reconstructed in outline this early account of the Lord\r\nJesus, so far as it has been used by both the later evangelists, we may\r\nattempt to compare the picture which it presents to us with that which\r\nwas offered by St Mark. But in doing so we must remember that we know it\r\nonly in fragments. There can be little doubt that much more of it is\r\nembedded in St Luke's Gospel, and something more also in St Matthew's;\r\nbut in order to stand on firm ground we have considered thus far only\r\nthose portions which both of these writers elected to use in composing\r\ntheir later narratives. To go beyond this is a work of delicate\r\ndiscrimination. It can only be effected by a close examination of the\r\nstyle and language of the document, which may enable us in some\r\ninstances to identify with comparative security certain passages which\r\nare found in St Luke, but which St Matthew did not regard as suitable\r\nfor his purpose. Among these we may venture, quite tentatively, to\r\nmention the sermon at Nazareth which opened with a passage from the Book\r\nof Isaiah, the raising of the widow's son at Nain, and the parable of\r\nthe good Samaritan. These are found in St Luke, but not in St Matthew.\r\nOn the other hand, it is not improbable that the wonderful words which\r\nbegin, \"Come unto Me all ye that labour,\" were drawn by St Matthew from\r\nthe same document, though they are not recorded by St Luke. But here we\r\nhave entered upon a region of less certainty, in which critical\r\nscholarship has still much to do; and these passages are mentioned here\r\nonly as a reminder that the document must have contained more than what\r\nSt Matthew and St Luke each independently determined to borrow from it.\r\nLooking, then, at the portions which we have indicated as having this\r\ntwo-fold testimony, we see that in their fragmentary condition we cannot\r\ntrace the clear historical development which was so conspicuous a\r\nfeature of St Mark's Gospel; yet we need not conclude that in its\r\ncomplete form it failed to present an orderly narrative. Next, we see\r\nthat wherever we are able to observe its method of relating an incident,\r\nas in the case of the healing of the centurion's servant, we have the\r\nsame characteristics of brevity and simplicity which we admired in St\r\nMark. No comment is made by the narrator; he tells his tale in the\r\nfewest words and passes on. Again, we note that it supplies just what we\r\nfeel we most need when we have reached the end of St Mark's story, a\r\nfuller account of the teaching which Jesus gave to His disciples and to\r\nthe people at large. And we see that the substance of that teaching is\r\nin complete harmony with the scattered hints that we found in St Mark.\r\nIf the fatherhood of God stands out clearly, we may remember a passage\r\nof St Mark also which speaks of \"the Heavenly Father\" as forgiving those\r\nwho forgive. If prayer is encouraged, we may also remember that the same\r\npassage of St Mark records the saying: \"All things whatsoever ye pray\r\nfor and ask, believe that ye have received them and ye shall have them.\"\r\nIf in one mysterious passage Jesus speaks of \"the Father\" and \"the\r\nSon\"--terms with which the Gospel of St John has made us familiar--St\r\nMark also in one passage uses the same impressive terms--\"the Son\" and\r\n\"the Father.\" There are, of course, many other parallels with St Mark,\r\nand at some points the two documents seem to overlap and to relate the\r\nsame incidents in somewhat different forms. There is the same use of\r\nparables from nature, the same incisiveness of speech and employment of\r\nparadox, the same demand to sacrifice all to Him and for His cause, the\r\nsame importunate claim made by Him on the human soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Element of Warning.\r\n\r\nBut the contrast between the two writers is even more important for our\r\npurpose. No one can read through the passages to which we have pointed\r\nwithout feeling the solemn sternness of the great Teacher, a sternness\r\nwhich can indeed be traced here and there in St Mark, but which does not\r\ngive its tone to the whole of his picture. Here we see Christ standing\r\nforth in solitary grandeur, looking with the eyes of another world on a\r\nsociety which is blindly hastening to its dissolution. It may be that if\r\nthis document had come down to us in its entirety, we should have\r\ngathered from it an exaggerated idea of the severity of our Lord's\r\ncharacter. Certain it is that as we read over these fragments we are\r\nsomewhat startled by the predominance of the element of warning, and by\r\nthe assertion of rules of conduct which seem almost inconsistent with a\r\nnormal condition of settled social life. The warning to the nation\r\nsounded by the Baptist, that God could raise up a new family for\r\nAbraham, is heard again and again in our Lord's teaching. Gentile faith\r\nputs Israel to shame. The sons of the kingdom will be left outside,\r\nwhile strangers feast with Abraham. Capernaum shall go to perdition;\r\nJerusalem shall be a desolate ruin. The doom of the nation is\r\npronounced; its fate is imminent; there is no ray of hope for the\r\nexisting constitution of religion and society. As to individuals within\r\nthe nation, the despised publicans and sinners will find God's favour\r\nbefore the self-satisfied representatives of the national religion. In\r\nsuch a condition of affairs it is hardly surprising to find that the\r\ngreat and stern Teacher congratulates the poor and has nothing but pity\r\nfor the rich; that He has no interest at all in comfort or property. If\r\na man asks you for anything, give it him; if he takes it without asking,\r\ndo not seek to recover it. Nothing material is worth a thought; anxiety\r\nis folly; your Father, who feeds His birds and clothes His flowers, will\r\nfeed and clothe you. Rise to the height of your sonship to God; love\r\nyour enemies even as God loves His; and if they kill you, God will care\r\nfor you still; fear them not, fear only Him who loves you all.\r\n\r\nHere is a new philosophy of life, offering solid consolation amid the\r\nruin of a world. We have no idea who the disciple may have been who thus\r\nseized upon the sadder elements of the teaching of Jesus; but we may\r\nwell think of him as one of those who were living in Palestine in the\r\ndark and threatening years of internecine strife, when the Roman eagles\r\nwere gathering round their prey, and the first thunder was muttering of\r\nthe storm which was to leave Jerusalem a heap of stones. At such a\r\nmoment the warnings of our Lord would claim a large place in a record of\r\nHis teaching, and the strange comfort which He had offered would be the\r\nonly hope which it would seem possible to entertain.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Earlier Narratives.\r\n\r\n4. _Additions by the Gospel according to St Matthew._--We have now\r\nexamined in turn the two earliest pictures which have been preserved to\r\nus of the life of Jesus Christ. The first portrays Him chiefly by a\r\nrecord of His actions, and illustrates His strength, His sympathy, and\r\nHis freedom from conventional restraints. It shows the disturbing forces\r\nof these characteristics, which aroused the envy and apprehension of the\r\nleaders of religion. The first bright days of welcome and popularity are\r\nsoon clouded: the storm begins to lower. More and more the Master\r\ndevotes Himself to the little circle of His disciples, who are taught\r\nthat they, as well as He, can only triumph through defeat, succeed by\r\nfailure, and find their life in giving it away. At length, in fear of\r\nreligious innovations and pretending that He is a political usurper, the\r\nJews deliver Him up to die on a Roman cross. The last page of the story\r\nis torn away, just at the point when it has been declared that He is\r\nalive again and about to show Himself to His disciples. The second\r\npicture has a somewhat different tone. It is mainly a record of\r\nteaching, and the teaching is for the most part stern and paradoxical.\r\nIt might be described as revolutionary. It is good tidings to the poor:\r\nit sets no store on property and material comfort: it pities the wealthy\r\nand congratulates the needy. It reverses ordinary judgments and\r\nconventional maxims of conduct. It proclaims the downfall of\r\ninstitutions, and compares the present blind security to the days of\r\nNoah and of Lot: a few only shall escape the coming overthrow. Yet even\r\nin this sterner setting the figure portrayed is unmistakably the same.\r\nThere is the same strength, the same tender sympathy, the same freedom\r\nfrom convention: there is the same promise to fulfil the highest hopes,\r\nthe same surrender of life, and the same imperious demand on the lives\r\nof others. No thoughtful man who examines and compares these pictures\r\ncan doubt that they are genuine historical portraits of a figure wholly\r\ndifferent from any which had hitherto appeared on the world's stage.\r\nThey are beyond the power of human invention. They are drawn with a\r\nsimplicity which is their own guarantee. If we had these, and these\r\nonly, we should have an adequate explanation of the beginnings of\r\nChristianity. There would still be a great gap to be filled before we\r\nreached the earliest letters of St Paul; but yet we should know what the\r\nApostle meant when he wrote to \"the Church of the Thessalonians in God\r\nthe Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,\" and reminded them how they had\r\n\"turned from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for His\r\nSon from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, even Jesus who delivereth\r\nus from the wrath to come.\"\r\n\r\nIf these two narratives served the first needs of Christian believers,\r\nit is easy to see that they would presently stimulate further activity\r\nin the same direction. For, to begin with, they were obviously\r\nincomplete: many incidents and teachings known to the earliest disciples\r\nfound no place in them; and they contained no account of the life of\r\nJesus Christ before His public ministry, no record of His pedigree, His\r\nbirth or His childhood. Secondly, their form left much to be desired;\r\nfor one of them at least was rude in style, sometimes needlessly\r\nrepetitive and sometimes brief to obscurity. Moreover the very fact that\r\nthere were two challenged a new and combined work which perhaps should\r\nsupersede both.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Gospel of St Matthew.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, some years after the fall of Jerusalem--we cannot tell the\r\nexact date or the author's name--the book which we call the Gospel\r\naccording to St Matthew was written to give the Palestinian Christians a\r\nfull account of Jesus Christ, which should present Him as the promised\r\nMessiah, fulfilling the ancient Hebrew prophecies, proclaiming the\r\nkingdom of heaven, and founding the Christian society. The writer takes\r\nSt Mark as his basis, but he incorporates into the story large portions\r\nof the teaching which he has found in the other document. He groups his\r\nmaterials with small regard to chronological order; and he fashions out\r\nof the many scattered sayings of our Lord continuous discourses,\r\neverywhere bringing like to like, with considerable literary art. A wide\r\nknowledge of the Old Testament supplies him with a text to illustrate\r\none incident after another; and so deeply is he impressed with the\r\ncorrespondence between the life of Christ and the words of ancient\r\nprophecy, that he does not hesitate to introduce his quotations by the\r\nformula \"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet.\"\r\n\r\nHis Hebrew instinct leads him to begin with a table of genealogy,\r\nartificially constructed in groups of fourteen generations--from Abraham\r\nto David, from David to the Captivity, and from the Captivity to the\r\nChrist. The royal descent of the Messiah is thus declared, and from the\r\noutset His figure is set against the background of the Old Testament. He\r\nthen proceeds to show that, though His lineage is traced through\r\nJoseph's ancestors, He was but the adopted son of Joseph, and he tells\r\nthe story of the Virgin-birth. The coming of the Child draws Eastern\r\nsages to his cradle and fills the court of Herod with suspicious fears.\r\nThe cruel tyrant kills the babes of Bethlehem, but the Child has been\r\nwithdrawn by a secret flight into Egypt, whence he presently returns to\r\nthe family home at Nazareth in Galilee. All this is necessarily fresh\r\nmaterial, for the other records had dealt only with the period of public\r\nministry. We have no knowledge of the source from which it was drawn.\r\nFrom the historical standpoint its value must be appraised by the\r\nestimate which is formed of the writer's general trustworthiness as a\r\nnarrator, and by the extent to which the incidents receive confirmation\r\nfrom other quarters. The central fact of the Virgin-birth, as we shall\r\npresently see, has high attestation from another early writer.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Discourses and Parables.\r\n\r\nThe next addition which St Matthew's Gospel makes to our knowledge is of\r\na different kind. It consists of various important sayings of our Lord,\r\nwhich are combined with discourses found in the second document and are\r\nworked up into the great utterance which we call the Sermon on the\r\nMount. Such grouping of materials is a feature of this Gospel, and was\r\npossibly designed for purposes of public instruction; so that continuous\r\npassages might be read aloud in the services of the Church, just as\r\npassages from the Old Testament were read in the Jewish synagogues. This\r\nmotive would account not only for the arrangement of the material, but\r\nalso for certain changes in the language which seem intended to remove\r\ndifficulties, and to interpret what is ambiguous or obscure. An example\r\nof such interpretation meets us at the outset. The startling saying,\r\n\"Blessed are ye poor,\" followed by the woe pronounced upon the rich,\r\nmight seem like a condemnation of the very principle of property; and\r\nwhen the Christian Church had come to be organized as a society\r\ncontaining rich and poor, the heart of the saying was felt to be more\r\ntruly and clearly expressed in the words, \"Blessed are the poor in\r\nspirit.\" This interpretative process may be traced again and again in\r\nthis Gospel, which frequently seems to reflect the definite tradition of\r\na settled Church.\r\n\r\nApart from the important parables of the tares, the pearl and the net,\r\nthe writer adds little to his sources until we come to the remarkable\r\npassage in ch. xvi., in which Peter the Rock is declared to be the\r\nfoundation of the future Church, and is entrusted with the keys of the\r\nkingdom of heaven. The function of \"binding and loosing,\" here assigned\r\nto him, is in identical terms assigned to the disciples generally in a\r\npassage in ch. xviii. in which for the second time we meet with the word\r\n\"Church\"--a word not found elsewhere in the Gospels. There is no\r\nsufficient ground for denying that these sayings were uttered by our\r\nLord, but the fact that they were now first placed upon record\r\nharmonizes with what has been said already as to the more settled\r\ncondition of the Christian society which this Gospel appears to reflect.\r\n\r\nThe parables of the two debtors, the labourers in the vineyard, the two\r\nsons, the ten virgins, the sheep and goats, are recorded only by this\r\nevangelist. But by way of incident he has almost nothing to add till we\r\ncome to the closing scenes. The earthquake at the moment of our Lord's\r\ndeath and the subsequent appearance of departed saints are strange\r\ntraditions unattested by other writers. The same is to be said of the\r\nsoldiers placed to guard the tomb, and of the story that they had been\r\nbribed to say that the sacred body had been stolen while they slept. On\r\nthe other hand, the appearance of the risen Christ to the women may have\r\nbeen taken from the lost pages of St Mark, being the sequel to the\r\nnarrative which is broken off abruptly in this Gospel: and it is not\r\nimprobable that St Mark's Gospel was the source of the great commission\r\nto preach and baptize with which St Matthew closes, though the wording\r\nof it has probably been modified in accordance with a settled tradition.\r\n\r\nThe work which the writer of this Gospel thus performed received the\r\nimmediate sanction of a wide acceptance. It met a definite spiritual\r\nneed. It presented the Gospel in a suitable form for the edification of\r\nthe Church; and it confirmed its truth by constant appeals to the Old\r\nTestament scriptures, thus manifesting its intimate relation with the\r\npast as the outcome of a long preparation and as the fulfilment of a\r\nDivine purpose. No Gospel is so frequently quoted by the early\r\npost-apostolic writers: none has exercised a greater influence upon\r\nChristianity, and consequently upon the history of the world.\r\n\r\nYet from the purely historical point of view its evidential value is not\r\nthe same as that of St Mark. Its facts for the most part are simply\r\ntaken over from the earlier evangelist, and the historian must obviously\r\nprefer the primary source. Its true importance lies in its attestation\r\nof the genuineness of the earlier portraits to which it has so little to\r\nadd, in its recognition of the relation of Christ to the whole purpose\r\nof God as revealed in the Old Testament, and in its interpretation of\r\nthe Gospel message in its bearing on the living Church of the primitive\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n5. _Additions by St Luke._--While the needs of Jewish believers were\r\namply met by St Matthew's Gospel, a like service was rendered to Gentile\r\nconverts by a very different writer. St Luke was a physician who had\r\naccompanied St Paul on his missionary journeys. He undertook a history\r\nof the beginnings of Christianity, two volumes of which have come down\r\nto us, entitled the Gospel and the Acts of the Apostles. His Gospel,\r\nlike St Matthew's, is founded on St Mark, with the incorporation of\r\nlarge portions of the second document of which we have spoken above. But\r\nthe way in which the two writers have used the same materials is\r\nstrikingly different. In St Matthew's Gospel the original sources are\r\nfrequently blended: the incidents of St Mark are rearranged and often\r\ngrouped afresh according to subject matter: harsh and ambiguous\r\nsentences of both documents are toned down or interpreted. St Luke, on\r\nthe contrary, chooses between parallel stories of his two sources,\r\npreferring neither to duplicate nor to combine: he incorporates St Mark\r\nin continuous sections, following him alone for a time, then leaving him\r\nentirely, and then returning to introduce a new block of his narrative.\r\nHe modifies St Mark's style very freely, but he makes less change in the\r\nrecorded words of our Lord, and he adheres more closely to the original\r\nlanguage of the second document.\r\n\r\nIn his first two chapters he gives an account of the birth and childhood\r\nof St John the Baptist and of our Lord Himself, gathered perhaps\r\ndirectly from the traditions of the Holy Family, and written in close\r\nimitation of the sacred stories of the Old Testament which were familiar\r\nto him in their Greek translation. The whole series of incidents differ\r\nfrom that which we find in St Matthew's Gospel, but there is no direct\r\nvariance between them. The two narratives are in agreement as to the\r\ncentral fact of the Virgin-birth. St Luke gives a table of genealogy\r\nwhich is irreconcilable with the artificial table of St Matthew's\r\nGospel, and which traces our Lord's ancestry up to Adam, \"which was the\r\nson of God.\"\r\n\r\nThe opening scene of the Galilean ministry is the discourse at Nazareth,\r\nin which our Lord claims to fulfil Isaiah's prophecy of the proclamation\r\nof good tidings to the poor. The same prophecy is alluded to in His\r\nreply to the Baptist's messengers which is incorporated subsequently\r\nfrom the second document. The scene ends with the rejection of Christ by\r\nHis own townsfolk, as in the parallel story of St Mark which St Luke\r\ndoes not give. It is probable that St Luke found this narrative in the\r\nsecond document, and chose it after his manner in preference to the less\r\ninstructive story in St Mark. He similarly omits the Marcan account of\r\nthe call of the fishermen, substituting the story of the miraculous\r\ndraught. After that he follows St Mark alone, until he introduces after\r\nthe call of the twelve apostles the sermon which begins with the\r\nbeatitudes and woes. This is from the second document, which he\r\ncontinues to use, and that without interruption (if we may venture to\r\nassign to it the raising of the widow's son at Nain and the anointing by\r\nthe sinful woman in the Pharisee's house), until he returns to\r\nincorporate another section from St Mark.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Characteristic Section of St. Luke's Gospel.\r\n\r\nThis in turn is followed by the most characteristic section of his\r\nGospel (ix. 51-xviii. 14), a long series of incidents wholly independent\r\nof St Mark, and introduced as belonging to the period of the final\r\njourney from Galilee to Jerusalem. Much of this material is demonstrably\r\nderived from the second document; and it is quite possible that the\r\nwhole of it may come from that source. There are special reasons for\r\nthinking so in regard to certain passages, as for example the mission of\r\nthe seventy disciples and the parable of the good Samaritan, although\r\nthey are not contained in St Matthew's Gospel.\r\n\r\nFor the closing scenes at Jerusalem St Luke makes considerable additions\r\nto St Mark's narrative: he gives a different account of the Last Supper,\r\nand he adds the trial before Herod and the incident of the penitent\r\nrobber. He appears to have had no information as to the appearance of\r\nthe risen Lord in Galilee, and he accordingly omits from his\r\nreproduction of St Mark's narrative the twice-repeated promise of a\r\nmeeting with the disciples there. He supplies, however, an account of\r\nthe appearance to the two disciples at Emmaus and to the whole body of\r\nthe apostles in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nSt Luke's use of his two main sources has preserved the characteristics\r\nof both of them. The sternness of certain passages, which has led some\r\ncritics to imagine that he was an Ebionite, is mainly, if not entirely,\r\ndue to his faithful reproduction of the language of the second document.\r\nThe key-note of his Gospel is universality: the mission of the Christ\r\nembraces the poor, the weak, the despised, the heretic and the sinful:\r\nit is good tidings to all mankind. He tells of the devotion of Mary and\r\nMartha, and of the band of women who ministered to our Lord's needs and\r\nfollowed Him to Jerusalem: he tells also of His kindness to more than\r\none sinful woman. Zacchaeus the publican and the grateful Samaritan\r\nleper further illustrate this characteristic. Writing as he does for\r\nGentile believers he omits many details which from their strongly Jewish\r\ncast might be unintelligible or uninteresting. He also modifies the\r\nharshness of St Mark's style, and frequently recasts his language in\r\nreference to diseases. From an historical point of view his Gospel is of\r\nhigh value. The proved accuracy of detail elsewhere, as in his narration\r\nof events which he witnessed in company with St Paul, enhances our\r\ngeneral estimation of his work. A trustworthy observer and a literary\r\nartist, the one non-Jewish evangelist has given us--to use M. Renan's\r\nwords--\"the most beautiful book in the world.\"\r\n\r\n6. _Additions by St John._--We come lastly to consider what addition to\r\nour knowledge of Christ's life and work is made by the Fourth Gospel. St\r\nMark's narrative of our Lord's ministry and passion is so simple and\r\nstraightforward that it satisfies our historical sense. We trace a\r\nnatural development in it: we seem to see why with such power and such\r\nsympathy He necessarily came into conflict with the religious leaders of\r\nthe people, who were jealous of the influence which He gained and were\r\nscandalized by His refusal to be hindered in His mission of mercy by\r\nrules and conventions to which they attached the highest importance. The\r\nissue is fought out in Galilee, and when our Lord finally journeys to\r\nJerusalem He knows that He goes there to die. The story is so plain and\r\nconvincing in itself that it gives at first sight an impression of\r\ncompleteness. This impression is confirmed by the Gospels of St Matthew\r\nand St Luke, which though they add much fresh material do not disturb\r\nthe general scheme presented by St Mark. But on reflection we are led to\r\nquestion the sufficiency of the account thus offered to us. Is it\r\nprobable, we ask, that our Lord should have neglected the sacred custom\r\nin accordance with which the pious Jew visited Jerusalem several times\r\neach year for the observance of the divinely appointed feasts? It is\r\ntrue that St Mark does not break his narrative of the Galilean ministry\r\nto record such visits: but this does not prove that such visits were not\r\nmade. Again, is it probable that He should have so far neglected\r\nJerusalem as to give it no opportunity of seeing Him and hearing His\r\nmessage until the last week of His life? If the writers of the other two\r\nGospels had no means at their disposal for enlarging the narrow\r\nframework of St Mark's narrative by recording definite visits to\r\nJerusalem, at least they preserve to us words from the second document\r\nwhich seem to imply such visits: for how else are we to explain the\r\npathetic complaint, \"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have\r\ngathered thee, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings; but ye\r\nwould not\"?\r\n\r\nSt John's Gospel meets our questionings by a wholly new series of\r\nincidents and by an account of a ministry which is concerned mainly not\r\nwith Galileans but with Judaeans, and which centres in Jerusalem. It is\r\ncarried on to a large extent concurrently with the Galilean ministry: it\r\nis not continuous, but is taken up from feast to feast as our Lord\r\nvisits the sacred city at the times of its greatest religious activity.\r\nIt differs in character from the Galilean ministry: for among the\r\nsimple, unsophisticated folk of Galilee Jesus presents Himself as a\r\nhealer and helper and teacher, keeping in the background as far as\r\npossible His claim to be the Messiah; whereas in Jerusalem His authority\r\nis challenged at His first appearance, the element of controversy is\r\nnever absent, His relation to God is from the outset the vital issue,\r\nand consequently His Divine claim is of necessity made explicit. Time\r\nafter time His life is threatened before the feast is ended, and when\r\nthe last passover has come we can well understand, what was not made\r\nsufficiently clear in the brief Marcan narrative, why Jerusalem proved\r\nso fatally hostile to His Messianic claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Purpose of St John's Gospel.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Gospel thus offers us a most important supplement to the\r\nlimited sketch of our Lord's life which we find in the Synoptic Gospels.\r\nYet this was not the purpose which led to its composition. That purpose\r\nis plainly stated by the author himself: \"These things have been written\r\nthat ye may believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that\r\nbelieving ye may have life in His name.\" His avowed aim is, not to write\r\nhistory, but to produce conviction. He desires to interpret the coming\r\nof Jesus Christ into the world, to declare whence and why He came, and\r\nto explain how His coming, as light in the midst of darkness, brought a\r\ncrisis into the lives of all with whom He came in contact. The issue of\r\nthis crisis in His rejection by the Jews at Jerusalem is the main theme\r\nof the book.\r\n\r\nSt John's prologue prepares us to find that he is not writing for\r\npersons who require a succinct narrative of facts, but for those who\r\nhaving such already in familiar use are asking deep questions as to our\r\nLord's mission. It goes back far behind human birth or lines of\r\nancestry. It begins, like the sacred story of creation, \"In the\r\nbeginning.\" The Book of Genesis had told how all things were called into\r\nexistence by a Divine utterance: \"God said, Let there be ... and there\r\nwas.\" The creative Word had been long personified by Jewish thought,\r\nespecially in connexion with the prophets to whom \"the Word of the Lord\"\r\ncame. \"In the beginning,\" then, St John tells us, the Word was--was with\r\nGod--yea, was God. He was the medium of creation, the source of its\r\nlight and its life--especially of that higher life which finds its\r\nmanifestation in men. So He was in the world, and the world was made by\r\nHim, and yet the world knew Him not. At length He came, came to the home\r\nwhich had been prepared for Him, but His own people rejected Him. But\r\nsuch as did receive Him found a new birth, beyond their birth of flesh\r\nand blood: they became children of God, were born of God. In order thus\r\nto manifest Himself He had undergone a human birth: \"the Word was made\r\nflesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory\"--the glory, as the\r\nevangelist has learned to see, of the Father's only-begotten Son, who\r\nhas come into the world to reveal to men that God whom \"no man hath ever\r\nseen.\" In these opening words we are invited to study the life of Christ\r\nfrom a new point of view, to observe His self-manifestation and its\r\nissue. The evangelist looks back across a period of half a century, and\r\nwrites of Christ not merely as he saw Him in those far-off days, but as\r\nhe has come by long experience to think and speak of Him. The past is\r\nnow filled with a glory which could not be so fully perceived at the\r\ntime, but which, as St John tells, it was the function of the Holy\r\nSpirit to reveal to Christ's disciples.\r\n\r\nThe first name which occurs in this Gospel is that of John the Baptist.\r\nHe is even introduced into the prologue which sketches in general terms\r\nthe manifestation of the Divine Word: \"There was a man sent from God,\r\nwhose name was John: he came for witness, to witness to the Light, that\r\nthrough him all might believe.\" This witness of John holds a position of\r\nhigh importance in this Gospel. His mission is described as running on\r\nfor a while concurrently with that of our Lord, whereas in the other\r\nGospels we have no record of our Lord's work until John is cast into\r\nprison. It is among the disciples of the Baptist on the banks of the\r\nJordan that Jesus finds His first disciples. The Baptist has pointed Him\r\nout to them in striking language, which recalls at once the symbolic\r\nritual of the law and the spiritual lessons of the prophets: \"Behold,\r\nthe Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\"\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards at Cana of Galilee Jesus gives His first \"sign,\" as the\r\nevangelist calls it, in the change of water into wine to supply the\r\ndeficiency at a marriage feast. This scene has all the happy brightness\r\nof the early Galilean ministry which St Mark records. It stands in sharp\r\ncontrast with the subsequent appearance of Jesus in Jerusalem at the\r\nPassover, when His first act is to drive the traders from the Temple\r\ncourts. In this He seems to be carrying the Baptist's stern mission of\r\npurification from the desert into the heart of the sacred city, and so\r\nfulfilling, perhaps consciously, the solemn prophecy of Malachi which\r\nopens with the words: \"Behold, I will send My Messenger, and He shall\r\nprepare the way before Me; and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come\r\nto His Temple\" (Mai. iii. 1-5). This significant action provokes a\r\nchallenge of His authority, which is answered by a mysterious saying,\r\nnot understood at the time, but interpreted afterwards as referring to\r\nthe Resurrection. After this our Lord was visited secretly by a Pharisee\r\nnamed Nicodemus, whose advances were severely met by the words, \"Except\r\na man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\" When Nicodemus\r\nobjected that this was to demand a physical impossibility, he was\r\nanswered that the new birth was \"of water and spirit\"--words which\r\ndoubtless contained a reference to the mission of the Baptist and to his\r\nprophecy of One who should baptize with the Holy Spirit. Towards the end\r\nof this conversation the evangelist passes imperceptibly from reporting\r\nthe words of the Lord into an interpretation or amplification of them,\r\nand in language which recalls the prologue he unfolds the meaning of\r\nChrist's mission and indicates the crisis of self-judgment which\r\nnecessarily accompanies the manifestation of the Light to each\r\nindividual. When he resumes his narrative the Lord has left Jerusalem,\r\nand is found baptizing disciples, in even greater numbers than the\r\nBaptist himself. Though Jesus did not personally perform the rite, it is\r\nplain once again that in this early period He closely linked His own\r\nmission with that of John the Baptist. When men hinted at a rivalry\r\nbetween them, John plainly declared \"He must increase, and I must\r\ndecrease\": and the reply of Jesus was to leave Judaea for Galilee.\r\n\r\nAway from the atmosphere of contention we find Him manifesting the same\r\nbroad sympathy and freedom from convention which we have noted in the\r\nother Gospels, especially in that of St Luke. He converses with a woman,\r\nwith a woman moreover who is a Samaritan, and who is of unchaste life.\r\nHe offers her the \"living water\" which shall supply all her needs: she\r\nreadily accepts Him as the expected Messiah, and He receives a welcome\r\nfrom the Samaritans. He passes on to Galilee, where also He is welcomed,\r\nand where He performs His second \"sign,\" healing the son of one of\r\nHerod's courtiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Ministry at Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nBut St John's interest does not lie in Galilee, and he soon brings our\r\nLord back to Jerusalem on the occasion of a feast. The Baptist's work is\r\nnow ended; and, though Jesus still appeals to the testimony of John, the\r\nnew conflict with the Jewish authorities shows that He is moving now on\r\nHis own independent and characteristic lines. In cleansing the Temple He\r\nhad given offence by what might seem an excess of rigour: now, by\r\nhealing a sick man and bidding him carry his bed on the Sabbath, He\r\noffended by His laxity. He answered His accusers by the brief but\r\npregnant sentence: \"My Father worketh even until now, and I work.\" They\r\nat once understood that He thus claimed a unique relation to God, and\r\ntheir antagonism became the more intense: \"the Jews therefore sought the\r\nmore to kill Him, because He had not only broken the Sabbath, but had\r\nalso said that God was His own Father, making Himself equal to God.\" His\r\nfirst reply is then expanded to cover the whole region of life. The Son\r\nbeholds the Father at work, and works concurrently, doing nothing of\r\nHimself. He does the Father's will. The very principle of life is\r\nentrusted to Him. He quickens, and He judges. As Son of Man He judges\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThe next incident is the feeding of the five thousand, which belongs to\r\nthe Galilean ministry and is recorded by the three other evangelists. St\r\nJohn's purpose in introducing it is not historical but didactic. It is\r\nmade the occasion of instruction as to the heavenly food, the flesh and\r\nblood of Him who came down from heaven. This teaching leads to a\r\nconflict with certain Judaeans who seem to have come from Jerusalem, and\r\nit proves a severe test even to the faith of disciples.\r\n\r\nThe feast of tabernacles brings fresh disputes in Jerusalem, and an\r\nattempt is made to arrest Jesus. A climax of indignation is reached when\r\na blind man is healed at the pool of Siloam on the sabbath day. At the\r\nfeast of the dedication a fresh effort at arrest was made, and Jesus\r\nthen withdrew beyond the Jordan. Here He learned of the sickness of\r\nLazarus, and presently He returned and came to Bethany to raise him from\r\nthe dead. The excitement produced by this miracle led to yet another\r\nattack, destined this time to be successful, on the life of Jesus. The\r\nPassover was at hand, and the last supper of our Lord with His disciples\r\non the evening before the Passover lamb was killed is made the occasion\r\nof the most inspiring consolations. Our Lord interprets His relation to\r\nthe disciples by the figure of a tree and its branches--He is the whole\r\nof which they are the parts; He promises the mission of the Holy Spirit\r\nto continue His work in the world; and He solemnly commends to His\r\nFather the disciples whom He is about to leave.\r\n\r\nThe account of the trial and the crucifixion differs considerably from\r\nthe accounts given in the other Gospels. St John's narratives are in\r\nlarge part personal memories, and in more than one incident he himself\r\nfigures as the unnamed disciple \"whom Jesus loved.\" In the Resurrection\r\nscenes he also gives incidents in which he has played a part; and the\r\nappearances of the risen Lord are not confined either to Jerusalem or to\r\nGalilee, but occur in both localities.\r\n\r\nIf we ask what is the special contribution to history, apart from\r\ntheology, which St John's Gospel makes, the answer would seem to be\r\nthis--that beside the Galilean ministry reported by St Mark there was a\r\nministry to \"Jews\" (Judaeans) in Jerusalem, not continuous, but\r\noccasional, taken up from time to time as the great feasts came round;\r\nthat its teaching was widely different from that which was given to\r\nGalileans, and that the situation created was wholly unlike that which\r\narose out of the Galilean ministry. The Galilean ministry opens with\r\nenthusiasm, ripening into a popularity which even endangers a\r\nsatisfactory result. Where opposition manifests itself, it is not native\r\nopposition, but comes from religious teachers who are parts of a system\r\nwhich centres in Jerusalem, and who are sometimes expressly noted as\r\nhaving come from Jerusalem. The Jerusalem ministry on the contrary is\r\nnever welcomed with enthusiasm. It has to do with those who challenge it\r\nfrom the first. There is no atmosphere of simplicity and teachableness\r\nwhich rejoices in the manifestation of power and sympathy and liberty.\r\nIt is a witness delivered to a hostile audience, whether they will hear\r\nor no. Ultimate issues are quickly raised: keen critics see at once the\r\nclaims which underlie deeds and words, and the claims in consequence\r\nbecome explicit: the relation of the teacher to God Himself is the vital\r\ninterest. The conflict which thus arose explains what St Mark's succinct\r\nnarrative had left unexplained--the fatal hostility of Jerusalem. It may\r\nhave been a part of St John's purpose to give this explanation, and to\r\nmake other supplements or corrections where earlier narratives appeared\r\nto him incomplete or misleading. But he says nothing to indicate this,\r\nwhile on the other hand he distinctly proclaims that his purpose is to\r\nproduce and confirm conviction of the divine claims of Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n  For bibliography see BIBLE; CHRISTIANITY; CHURCH HISTORY; and the\r\n  articles on the separate Gospels.     (J. A. R.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJET (Fr. _jais_, Ger. _Gagat_), a substance which seems to be a peculiar\r\nkind of lignite or anthracite; often cut and polished for ornaments. The\r\nword \"jet\" probably comes, through O. Fr. _jaiet_, from the classical\r\n_gagates_, a word which was derived, according to Pliny, from Gagas, in\r\nLycia, where jet, or a similar substance, was originally found. Jet was\r\nused in Britain in prehistoric times; many round barrows of the Bronze\r\nage have yielded jet beads, buttons, rings, armlets and other ornaments.\r\nThe abundance of jet in Britain is alluded to by Caius Julius Solinus\r\n(fl. 3rd century) and jet ornaments are found with Roman relics in\r\nBritain. Probably the supply was obtained from the coast of Yorkshire,\r\nespecially near Whitby, where nodules of jet were formerly picked up on\r\nthe shore. Caedmon refers to this jet, and at a later date it was used\r\nfor rosary beads by the monks of Whitby Abbey.\r\n\r\n  The Whitby jet occurs in irregular masses, often of lenticular shape,\r\n  embedded in hard shales known as jet-rock. The jet-rock series belongs\r\n  to that division of the Upper Lias which is termed the zone of\r\n  _Ammonites serpentinus_. Microscopic examination of jet occasionally\r\n  reveals the structure of coniferous wood, which A. C. Seward has shown\r\n  to be araucarian. Probably masses of wood were brought down by a\r\n  river, and drifted out to sea, where becoming water-logged they sank,\r\n  and became gradually buried in a deposit of fine mud, which eventually\r\n  hardened into shale. Under pressure, perhaps assisted by heat, and\r\n  with exclusion of air, the wood suffered a peculiar kind of\r\n  decomposition, probably modified by the presence of salt water, as\r\n  suggested by Percy E. Spielmann. Scales of fish and other fossils of\r\n  the jet-rock are frequently impregnated with bituminous products,\r\n  which may replace the original tissues. Drops of liquid bitumen occur\r\n  in the cavities of some fossils, whilst inflammable gas is not\r\n  uncommon in the jet-workings, and petroleum may be detected by its\r\n  smell. Iron pyrites is often associated with the jet.\r\n\r\n  Formerly sufficient jet was found in loose pieces on the shore, set\r\n  free by the disintegration of the cliffs, or washed up from a\r\n  submarine source. When this supply became insufficient, the rock was\r\n  attacked by the jet-workers; ultimately the workings took the form of\r\n  true mines, levels being driven into the shales not only at their\r\n  outcrop in the cliffs but in some of the inland dales of the Yorkshire\r\n  moorlands, such as Eskdale. The best jet has a uniform black colour,\r\n  and is hard, compact and homogeneous in texture, breaking with a\r\n  conchoidal fracture. It must be tough enough to be readily carved or\r\n  turned on the lathe, and sufficiently compact in texture to receive a\r\n  high polish. The final polish was formerly given by means of rouge,\r\n  which produces a beautiful velvety surface, but rotten-stone and\r\n  lampblack are often employed instead. The softer kinds, not capable of\r\n  being freely worked, are known as bastard jet. A soft jet is obtained\r\n  from the estuarine series of the Lower Oolites of Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n  Much jet is imported from Spain, but it is generally less hard and\r\n  lustrous than true Whitby jet. In Spain the chief locality is\r\n  Villaviciosa, in the province of Asturias. France furnishes jet,\r\n  especially in the department of the Aude. Much jet, too, occurs in the\r\n  Lias of Württemberg, and works have been established for its\r\n  utilization. In the United States jet is known at many localities but\r\n  is not systematically worked. Pennsylvanian anthracite, however, has\r\n  been occasionally employed as a substitute. In like manner Scotch\r\n  cannel coal has been sometimes used at Whitby. Imitations of jet, or\r\n  substitutes for it, are furnished by vulcanite, glass, black obsidian\r\n  and black onyx, or stained chalcedony. Jet is sometimes improperly\r\n  termed black amber, because like amber, though in less degree, it\r\n  becomes electric by friction.\r\n\r\n  See P. E. Spielmann, \"On the Origin of Jet,\" _Chemical News_ (Dec. 14,\r\n  1906); C. Fox-Strangways, \"The Jurassic Rocks of Britain, Vol. I.\r\n  Yorkshire,\" _Mem. Geol. Surv._ (1892); J. A. Bower, \"Whitby Jet and\r\n  its Manufacture,\" _Journ. Soc. Arts_ (1874, vol. xxii. p. 80).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJETHRO (or JETHER, Exod. iv. 18), the priest of Midian, in the Bible,\r\nwhose daughter Zipporah became the wife of Moses. He is known as Hobab\r\nthe son of Reuel the Kenite (Num. x. 29; Judg. iv. 11 ), and once as\r\nReuel (Exod. ii. 18); and if Zipporah is the wife of Moses referred to\r\nin Num. xii. 1, the family could be regarded as Cushite (see Cush).\r\nJethro was the priest of Yahweh, and resided at the sacred mountain\r\nwhere the deity commissioned Moses to deliver the Israelites from Egypt.\r\nSubsequently Jethro came to Moses (probably at Kadesh), a great\r\nsacrificial feast was held, and the priest instructed Moses in\r\nlegislative procedure; Exod. xviii. 27 (see EXODUS) and Num. x. 30 imply\r\nthat the scene was not Sinai. Jethro was invited to accompany the people\r\ninto the promised land, and later, we find his clan settling in the\r\nsouth of Judah (Judg. i. 16); see KENITES. The traditions agree in\r\nrepresenting the kin of Moses as related to the mixed tribes of the\r\nsouth of Palestine (see EDOM) and in ascribing to the family an\r\nimportant share in the early development of the worship of Yahweh.\r\nCheyne suggests that the names of Hobab and of Jonadab the father of the\r\nRechabites (q.v.) were originally identical (_Ency. Bib._ ii. col.\r\n2101).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJETTY. The term jetty, derived from Fr. _jetée_, and therefore\r\nsignifying something \"thrown out,\" is applied to a variety of structures\r\nemployed in river, dock and maritime works, which are generally carried\r\nout in pairs from river banks, or in continuation of river channels at\r\ntheir outlets into deep water; or out into docks, and outside their\r\nentrances; or for forming basins along the sea-coast for ports in\r\ntideless seas. The forms and construction of these jetties are as varied\r\nas their uses; for though they invariably extend out into water, and\r\nserve either for directing a current or for accommodating vessels, they\r\nare sometimes formed of high open timber-work, sometimes of low solid\r\nprojections, and occasionally only differ from breakwaters in their\r\nobject.\r\n\r\n  _Jetties for regulating Rivers._--Formerly jetties of timber-work were\r\n  very commonly extended out, opposite one another, from each bank of a\r\n  river, at intervals, to contract a wide channel, and by concentration\r\n  of the current to produce a deepening of the central channel; or\r\n  sometimes mounds of rubble stone, stretching down the foreshore from\r\n  each bank, served the same purpose. As, however, this system\r\n  occasioned a greater scour between the ends of the jetties than in the\r\n  intervening channels, and consequently produced an irregular depth, it\r\n  has to a great extent been superseded by longitudinal training works,\r\n  or by dipping cross dikes pointing somewhat upstream (see RIVER\r\n  ENGINEERING).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG 1.--Timber Jetty across Dock Slope.]\r\n\r\n  _Jetties at Docks._--Where docks are given sloping sides, openwork\r\n  timber jetties are generally carried across the slope, at the ends of\r\n  which vessels can lie in deep water (fig. 1); or more solid structures\r\n  are erected over the slope for supporting coal-tips. Pilework jetties\r\n  are also constructed in the water outside the entrances to docks on\r\n  each side, so as to form an enlarging trumpet-shaped channel between\r\n  the entrance, lock or tidal basin and the approach channel, in order\r\n  to guide vessels in entering or leaving the docks. Solid jetties,\r\n  moreover, lined with quay walls, are sometimes carried out into a wide\r\n  dock, at right angles to the line of quays at the side, to enlarge the\r\n  accommodation; and they also serve, when extended on a large scale\r\n  from the coast of a tideless sea under shelter of an outlying\r\n  breakwater, to form the basins in which vessels lie when discharging\r\n  and taking in cargoes in such a port as Marseilles (see DOCK).\r\n\r\n  _Jetties at Entrances to Jetty Harbours._--The approach channel to\r\n  some ports situated on sandy coasts is guided and protected across the\r\n  beach by parallel jetties, made solid up to a little above low water\r\n  of neap tides, on which open timber-work is erected, provided with a\r\n  planked platform at the top raised above the highest tides. The\r\n  channel between the jetties was originally maintained by tidal scour\r\n  from low-lying areas close to the coast, and subsequently by the\r\n  current from sluicing basins; but it is now often considerably\r\n  deepened by sand-pump dredging. It is protected to some extent by the\r\n  solid portion of the jetties from the inroad of sand from the adjacent\r\n  beach, and from the levelling action of the waves; whilst the upper\r\n  open portion serves to indicate the channel, and to guide the vessels\r\n  if necessary (see HARBOUR). The bottom part of the older jetties, in\r\n  such long-established jetty ports as Calais, Dunkirk and Ostend, was\r\n  composed of clay or rubble stone, covered on the top by fascine-work\r\n  or pitching; but the deepening of the jetty channel by dredging, and\r\n  the need which arose for its enlargement, led to the reconstruction of\r\n  the jetties at these ports. The new jetties at Dunkirk were founded in\r\n  the sandy beach, by the aid of compressed air, at a depth of 22¾ ft.\r\n  below low water of spring tides; and their solid masonry portion, on a\r\n  concrete foundation, was raised 5(3/5) ft. above low water of neap\r\n  tides (fig. 2).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Dunkirk East Jetty.]\r\n\r\n  _Jetties at Lagoon Outlets._--A small tidal rise spreading tidal water\r\n  over a large expanse of lagoon or inland back-water causes the influx\r\n  and efflux of the tide to maintain a deep channel through a narrow\r\n  outlet; but the issuing current on emerging from the outlet, being no\r\n  longer confined by a bank on each side, becomes dispersed, and owing\r\n  to the reduction of its scouring force, is no longer able at a\r\n  moderate distance from the shore effectually to resist the action of\r\n  the waves and littoral currents tending to form a continuous beach in\r\n  front of the outlet. Hence a bar is produced which diminishes the\r\n  available depth in the approach channel. By carrying out a solid jetty\r\n  over the bar, however, on each side of the outlet, the tidal currents\r\n  are concentrated in the channel across the bar, and lower it by scour.\r\n  Thus the available depth of the approach channels to Venice through\r\n  the Malamocco and Lido outlets from the Venetian lagoon have been\r\n  deepened several feet over their bars by jetties of rubble stone\r\n  surmounted by a small superstructure (fig. 3), carried out across the\r\n  foreshore into deep water on both sides of the channel. Other examples\r\n  are provided by the long jetties extended into the sea in front of the\r\n  entrance to Charleston harbour, formerly constructed of fascines,\r\n  weighted with stone and logs, but subsequently of rubble stone, and by\r\n  the two converging rubble jetties carried out from each shore of\r\n  Dublin bay for deepening the approach to Dublin harbour.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Lido Outlet Jetty, Venice.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Mississippi South Pass Outlet Jetty.]\r\n\r\n  _Jetties at the Outlet of Tideless Rivers._--Jetties have been\r\n  constructed on each side of the outlet of some of the rivers flowing\r\n  into the Baltic, with the objects of prolonging the scour of the river\r\n  and protecting the channel from being shoaled by the littoral drift\r\n  along the shore. The most interesting application of parallel jetties\r\n  is in lowering the bar in front of one of the mouths of a deltaic\r\n  river flowing into a tideless sea, by extending the scour of the river\r\n  out to the bar by a virtual prolongation of its banks. Jetties\r\n  prolonging the Sulina branch of the Danube into the Black Sea, and the\r\n  south pass of the Mississippi into the Gulf of Mexico (fig. 4), formed\r\n  of rubble stone and concrete blocks, and fascine mattresses weighted\r\n  with stone and surmounted with large concrete blocks respectively,\r\n  have enabled the discharge of these rivers to scour away the bars\r\n  obstructing the access to them; and they have also carried the\r\n  sediment-bearing waters sufficiently far out to come under the\r\n  influence of littoral currents, which, by conveying away some of the\r\n  sediment, postpone the eventual formation of a fresh bar farther out\r\n  (see RIVER ENGINEERING).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 5.--River Maas Outlet, North Jetty.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 6.--River Nervion Outlet, Western Jetty.]\r\n\r\n  _Jetties at the Mouth of Tidal Rivers._--Where a river is narrow near\r\n  its mouth, and its discharge is generally feeble, the sea is liable on\r\n  an exposed coast, when the tidal range is small, to block up its\r\n  outlet during severe storms. The river is thus forced to seek another\r\n  exit at a weak spot of the beach, which along a low coast may be at\r\n  some distance off; and this new outlet in its turn may be blocked up,\r\n  so that the river from time to time shifts the position of its mouth.\r\n  This inconvenient cycle of changes may be stopped by fixing the outlet\r\n  of the river at a suitable site, by carrying a jetty on each side of\r\n  this outlet across the beach, thereby concentrating its discharge in a\r\n  definite channel and protecting the mouth from being blocked up by\r\n  littoral drift. This system was long ago applied to the shifting\r\n  outlet of the river Yare to the south of Yarmouth, and has also been\r\n  successfully employed for fixing the wandering mouth of the Adur near\r\n  Shoreham, and of the Adour flowing into the Bay of Biscay below\r\n  Bayonne. When a new channel was cut across the Hook of Holland to\r\n  provide a straighter and deeper outlet channel for the river Maas,\r\n  forming the approach channel to Rotterdam, low, broad, parallel\r\n  jetties, composed of fascine mattresses weighted with stone (fig. 5),\r\n  were carried across the foreshore into the sea on either side of the\r\n  new mouth of the river, to protect the jetty channel from littoral\r\n  drift, and cause the discharge of the river to maintain it out to deep\r\n  water (see RIVER ENGINEERING). The channel, also, beyond the outlet of\r\n  the river Nervion into the Bay of Biscay has been regulated by\r\n  jetties; and by extending the south-west jetty out for nearly half a\r\n  mile with a curve concave towards the channel the outlet has not only\r\n  been protected to some extent from the easterly drift, but the bar in\r\n  front has been lowered by the scour produced by the discharge of the\r\n  river following the concave bend of the south-west jetty. As the outer\r\n  portion of this jetty was exposed to westerly storms from the Bay of\r\n  Biscay before the outer harbour was constructed, it has been given the\r\n  form and strength of a breakwater situated in shallow water (fig. 6).\r\n       (L.

(1901), 5486. The chief industries are weaving, spinning,\r\ndyeing, brewing and milling; there is also a trade in horses and cattle.\r\nThe fathers (_Die Getreuen_) of the town used to send an annual birthday\r\npresent of 101 plovers' eggs to Bismarck, with a dedication in verse.\r\n\r\nThe castle of Jever was built by Prince Edo Wiemken (d. 1410), the ruler\r\nof Jeverland, a populous district which in 1575 came under the rule of\r\nthe dukes of Oldenburg. In 1603 it passed to the house of Anhalt and was\r\nlater the property of the empress Catherine II. of Russia, a member of\r\nthis family. In 1814 it came again into the possession of Oldenburg.\r\n\r\n  See D. Hohnholz, _Aus Jevers Vorgangenheit_ (Jever, 1886); Hagena,\r\n  _Jeverland bis zum Jahr_ 1500 (Oldenburg, 1902); and F. W.
