A. FYFFE, M.A.\r\n\r\nBarrister-at-Law; Fellow of University College, Oxford;\r\nVice-President of the Royal Historical Society\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPULAR EDITION\r\n\r\nWith Maps\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn acceding to the Publishers' request for a re-issue of the \"History of\r\nModern Europe,\" in the form of a popular edition, I feel that I am only\r\nfulfilling what would have been the wish of the Author himself. A few\r\nmanuscript corrections and additions found in his own copy of the work have\r\nbeen adopted in the present edition; in general, however, my attention in\r\nrevising each sheet for the press has been devoted to securing an accurate\r\nreproduction of the text and notes as they appeared in the previous\r\neditions in three volumes. I trust that in this cheaper and more portable\r\nform the work will prove, both to the student and the general reader, even\r\nmore widely acceptable than heretofore.\r\n\r\nHENRIETTA F. A. FYFFE.\r\n\r\nLondon, November, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of this work is to show how the States of Europe have gained the\r\nform and character which they possess at the present moment. The outbreak\r\nof the Revolutionary War in 1792, terminating a period which now appears\r\nfar removed from us, and setting in motion forces which have in our own day\r\nproduced a united Germany and a united Italy, forms the natural\r\nstarting-point of a history of the present century. I have endeavoured to\r\ntell a simple story, believing that a narrative in which facts are chosen\r\nfor their significance, and exhibited in their real connection, may be made\r\nto convey as true an impression as a fuller history in which the writer is\r\nnot forced by the necessity of concentration to exercise the same rigour\r\ntowards himself and his materials. The second volume of the work will bring\r\nthe reader down to the year 1848: the third, down to the present time.\r\n\r\nLondon, 1880.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION OF THE FIRST VOLUME. [1]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn revising this volume for the second edition I have occupied myself\r\nmainly with two sources of information--the unpublished Records of the\r\nEnglish Foreign Office, and the published works which have during recent\r\nyears resulted from the investigation of the Archives of Vienna. The\r\nEnglish Records from 1792 to 1814, for access to which I have to express my\r\nthanks to Lord Granville, form a body of first-hand authority of\r\nextraordinary richness, compass, and interest. They include the whole\r\ncorrespondence between the representatives of Great Britain at Foreign\r\nCourts and the English Foreign Office; a certain number of private\r\ncommunications between Ministers and these representatives; a quantity of\r\nreports from consuls, agents, and \"informants\" of every description; and in\r\naddition to these the military reports, often admirably vivid and full of\r\nmatter, sent by the British officers attached to the head-quarters of our\r\nAllies in most of the campaigns from 1792 to 1814. It is impossible that\r\nany one person should go through the whole of this material, which it took\r\nthe Diplomatic Service a quarter of a century to write. I have endeavoured\r\nto master the correspondence from each quarter of Europe which, for the\r\ntime being, had a preponderance in political or military interest, leaving\r\nit when its importance became obviously subordinate to that of others; and\r\nalthough I have no doubt left untouched much that would repay\r\ninvestigation, I trust that the narrative has gained in accuracy from a\r\nlabour which was not a light one, and that the few short extracts which\r\nspace has permitted me to throw into the notes may serve to bring the\r\nreader nearer to events. At some future time I hope to publish a selection\r\nfrom the most important documents of this period. It is strange that our\r\nlearned Societies, so appreciative of every distant and trivial chronicle\r\nof the Middle Ages, should ignore the records of a time of such surpassing\r\ninterest, and one in which England played so great a part. No just\r\nconception can be formed of the difference between English statesmanship\r\nand that of the Continental Courts in integrity, truthfulness, and public\r\nspirit, until the mass of diplomatic correspondence preserved at London has\r\nbeen studied; nor, until this has been done, can anything like an adequate\r\nbiography of Pitt be written.\r\n\r\nThe second and less important group of authorities with which I have busied\r\nmyself during the work of revision comprises the works of Hüffer, Vivenot,\r\nBeer, Helfert, and others, based on Austrian documents, along with the\r\nAustrian documents and letters that have been published by Vivenot. The\r\nlast-named writer is himself a partizan, but the material which he has\r\ngiven to the world is most valuable. The mystery in which the Austrian\r\nGovernment until lately enveloped all its actions caused some of these to\r\nbe described as worse than they really were; and I believe that in the\r\nFirst Edition I under-estimated the bias of Prussian and North-German\r\nwriters. Where I have seen reasons to alter any statements, I have done so\r\nwithout reserve, as it appears to me childish for any one who attempts to\r\nwrite history to cling to an opinion after the balance of evidence seems to\r\nbe against it. The publication of the second volume of this work has been\r\ndelayed by the revision of the first; but I hope that it will appear before\r\nmany months more. I must express my obligations to Mr. Oscar Browning, a\r\nfellow-labourer in the same field, who not only furnished me with various\r\ncorrections, but placed his own lectures at my disposal; and to Mr. Alfred\r\nKingston, whose unfailing kindness and courtesy make so great a difference\r\nto those whose work lies in the department of the Record Office which is\r\nunder his care.\r\n\r\nLondon, 1883.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME. [2]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn writing this volume I have not had the advantage of consulting the\r\nEnglish Foreign Office Records for a later period than the end of 1815. A\r\nrule not found necessary at Berlin and some other foreign capitals still\r\ncloses to historical inquirers the English documents of the last seventy\r\nyears. Restrictions are no doubt necessary in the case of transactions of\r\nrecent date, but the period of seventy years is surely unnecessarily long.\r\nPublic interests could not be prejudiced, nor could individuals be even\r\nremotely affected, by the freest examination of the papers of 1820 or 1830.\r\n\r\nThe London documents of 1814-1815 are of various degrees of interest and\r\nimportance. Those relating to the Congress of Vienna are somewhat\r\ndisappointing. Taken all together, they add less to our knowledge on the\r\none or two points still requiring elucidation than the recently-published\r\ncorrespondence of Talleyrand with Louis XVIII. The despatches from Italy\r\nare on the other hand of great value, proving, what I believe was not\r\nestablished before, that the Secret Treaty of 1815, whereby Austria gained\r\na legal right to prevent any departure from absolute Government at Naples,\r\nwas communicated to the British Ministry and received its sanction. This\r\nsanction explains the obscure and embarrassed language of Castlereagh in\r\n1820, which in its turn gave rise to the belief in Italy that England was\r\nmore deeply committed to Austria than it actually was, and probably\r\noccasioned the forgery of the pretended Treaty of July 27, 1813, exposed in\r\nvol. i. of this work, p. 538, 2nd edit. [3] The papers from France and\r\nSpain are also interesting, though not establishing any new conclusions.\r\n\r\nWhile regretting that I have not been able to use the London archives later\r\nthan 1815, I believe that it is nevertheless possible, without recourse to\r\nunpublished papers, to write the history of the succeeding thirty years\r\nwith substantial correctness. There exist in a published form, apart from\r\ndocuments printed officially, masses of first-hand material of undoubtedly\r\nauthentic character, such as the great English collection known by the\r\nsomewhat misleading name of Wellington Despatches, New Series; or again,\r\nthe collection printed as an appendix to Prokesch von Osten's History of\r\nthe Greek Rebellion, or the many volumes of Gentz' Correspondence belonging\r\nto the period about 1820, when Gentz was really at the centre of affairs.\r\nThe Metternich papers, interesting as far as they go, are a mere selection.\r\nThe omissions are glaring, and scarcely accidental. Many minor collections\r\nbearing on particular events might be named, such as those in Guizot's\r\nMémoires. Frequent references will show my obligation to the German series\r\nof historical works constituting the Leipzig Staatengeschichte, as well as\r\nto French authors who, like Viel-Castel, have worked with original sources\r\nof information before them. There exist in English literature singularly\r\nfew works on this period of Continental history.\r\n\r\nA greater publicity was introduced into political affairs on the Continent\r\nby the establishment of Parliamentary Government in France in 1815, and\r\neven by the attempts made to introduce it in other States. In England we\r\nhave always had freedom of discussion, but the amount of information made\r\npublic by the executive in recent times has been enormously greater than it\r\nwas at the end of the last century. The only documents published at the\r\noutbreak of the war of 1793 were, so far as I can ascertain, the well-known\r\nletters of Chauvelin and Lord Grenville. During the twenty years' struggle\r\nwith France next to nothing was known of the diplomatic transactions\r\nbetween England and the Continental Powers. But from the time of the Reform\r\nBill onwards the amount of information given to the public has been\r\nconstantly increasing, and the reader of Parliamentary Papers in our own\r\nday is likely to complain of diffusiveness rather than of reticence.\r\nNevertheless the perusal of published papers can never be quite the same\r\nthing as an examination of the originals; and the writer who first has\r\naccess to the English archives after 1815 will have an advantage over those\r\nwho have gone before him.\r\n\r\nThe completion of this volume has been delayed by almost every circumstance\r\nadverse to historical study and production, including a severe\r\nParliamentary contest. I trust, however, that no trace of partisanship or\r\nunrest appears in the work, which I have valued for the sake of the mental\r\ndiscipline which it demanded. With quieter times the third volume will, I\r\ntrust, advance more rapidly.\r\n\r\nLONDON, October, 1886.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The third volume was published in

XVI. brought down a letter from the King\r\nto the Legislative Assembly of France. The letter was brief but\r\nsignificant. It announced that the King intended to appear in the Hall of\r\nAssembly at noon on the following day. Though the letter did not disclose\r\nthe object of the King's visit, it was known that Louis had given way to\r\nthe pressure of his Ministry and the national cry for war, and that a\r\ndeclaration of war against Austria was the measure which the King was about\r\nto propose in person to the Assembly. On the morrow the public thronged the\r\nhall; the Assembly broke off its debate at midday in order to be in\r\nreadiness for the King. Louis entered the hall in the midst of deep\r\nsilence, and seated himself beside the President in the chair which was now\r\nsubstituted for the throne of France. At the King's bidding General\r\nDumouriez, Minister of Foreign Affairs, read a report to the Assembly upon\r\nthe relations of France to foreign Powers. The report contained a long\r\nseries of charges against Austria, and concluded with the recommendation of\r\nwar. When Dumouriez ceased reading Louis rose, and in a low voice declared\r\nthat he himself and the whole of the Ministry accepted the report read to\r\nthe Assembly; that he had used every effort to maintain peace, and in vain;\r\nand that he was now come, in accordance with the terms of the Constitution,\r\nto propose that the Assembly declare war against the Austrian Sovereign. It\r\nwas not three months since Louis himself had supplicated the Courts of\r\nEurope for armed aid against his own subjects. The words which he now\r\nuttered were put in his mouth by men whom he hated, but could not resist:\r\nthe very outburst of applause that followed them only proved the fatal\r\nantagonism that existed between the nation and the King. After the\r\nPresident of the Assembly had made a short answer, Louis retired from the\r\nhall. The Assembly itself broke up, to commence its debate on the King's\r\nproposal after an interval of some hours. When the House re-assembled in\r\nthe evening, those few courageous men who argued on grounds of national\r\ninterest and justice against the passion of the moment could scarcely\r\nobtain a hearing. An appeal for a second day's discussion was rejected; the\r\ndebate abruptly closed; and the declaration of war was carried against\r\nseven dissentient votes. It was a decision big with consequences for France\r\nand for the world. From that day began the struggle between Revolutionary\r\nFrance and the established order of Europe. A period opened in which almost\r\nevery State on the Continent gained some new character from the aggressions\r\nof France, from the laws and political changes introduced by the conqueror,\r\nor from the awakening of new forces of national life in the crisis of\r\nsuccessful resistance or of humiliation. It is my intention to trace the\r\ngreat lines of European history from that time to the present, briefly\r\nsketching the condition of some of the principal States at the outbreak of\r\nthe Revolutionary War, and endeavouring to distinguish, amid scenes of\r\never-shifting incident, the steps by which the Europe of 1792 has become\r\nthe Europe of to-day.\r\n\r\n[First threats of foreign Courts against France, 1791.]\r\n\r\nThe first two years of the Revolution had ended without bringing France\r\ninto collision with foreign Powers. This was not due to any goodwill that\r\nthe Courts of Europe bore to the French people, or to want of effort on the\r\npart of the French aristocracy to raise the armies of Europe against their\r\nown country. The National Assembly, which met in 1789, had cut at the roots\r\nof the power of the Crown; it had deprived the nobility of their privileges,\r\nand laid its hand upon the revenues of the Church. The brothers of King\r\nLouis XVI., with a host of nobles too impatient to pursue a course of\r\nsteady political opposition at home, quitted France, and wearied foreign\r\nCourts with their appeals for armed assistance. The absolute monarchs of\r\nthe Continent gave them a warm and even ostentatious welcome; but they\r\nconfined their support to words and tokens of distinction, and until the\r\nsummer of 1791 the Revolution was not seriously threatened with the\r\ninterference of the stranger. The flight of King Louis from Paris in June,\r\n1791, followed by his capture and his strict confinement within the\r\nTuileries, gave rise to the first definite project of foreign intervention.\r\n[4] Louis had fled from his capital and from the National Assembly; he\r\nreturned, the hostage of a populace already familiar with outrage and\r\nbloodshed. For a moment the exasperation of Paris brought the Royal Family\r\ninto real jeopardy. The Emperor Leopold, brother of Marie Antoinette,\r\ntrembled for the safety of his unhappy sister, and addressed a letter to\r\nthe European Courts from Padua, on the 6th of July, proposing that the\r\nPowers should unite to preserve the Royal Family of France from popular\r\nviolence. Six weeks later the Emperor and King Frederick William II. of\r\nPrussia met at Pillnitz, in Saxony. A declaration was published by the two\r\nSovereigns, stating that they considered the position of the King of France\r\nto be matter of European concern, and that, in the event of all the other\r\ngreat Powers consenting to a joint action, they were prepared to supply an\r\narmed force to operate on the French frontier.\r\n\r\n[Declaration of Pillnitz withdrawn.]\r\n\r\nHad the National Assembly instantly declared war on Leopold and Frederick\r\nWilliam, its action would have been justified by every rule of\r\ninternational law. The Assembly did not, however, declare war, and for a\r\ngood reason. It was known at Paris that the manifesto was no more than a\r\ndevice of the Emperor's to intimidate the enemies of the Royal Family.\r\nLeopold, when he pledged himself to join a coalition of all the Powers, was\r\nin fact aware that England would be no party to any such coalition. He was\r\ndetermined to do nothing that would force him into war; and it did not\r\noccur to him that French politicians would understand the emptiness of his\r\nthreats as well as he did himself. Yet this turned out to be the case; and\r\nwhatever indignation the manifesto of Pillnitz excited in the mass of the\r\nFrench people, it was received with more derision than alarm by the men who\r\nwere cognisant of the affairs of Europe. All the politicians of the\r\nNational Assembly knew that Prussia and Austria had lately been on the\r\nverge of war with one another upon the Eastern question; they even\r\nunderrated the effect of the French revolution in appeasing the existing\r\nenmities of the great Powers. No important party in France regarded the\r\nDeclaration of Pillnitz as a possible reason for hostilities; and the\r\nchallenge given to France was soon publicly withdrawn. It was withdrawn\r\nwhen Louis XVI., by accepting the Constitution made by the National\r\nAssembly, placed himself, in the sight of Europe, in the position of a free\r\nagent. On the 14th September, 1791, the King, by a solemn public oath,\r\nidentified his will with that of the nation. It was known in Paris that he\r\nhad been urged by the emigrants to refuse his assent, and to plunge the\r\nnation into civil war by an open breach with the Assembly. The frankness\r\nwith which Louis pledged himself to the Constitution, the seeming sincerity\r\nof his patriotism, again turned the tide of public opinion in his favour.\r\nHis flight was forgiven; the restrictions placed upon his personal liberty\r\nwere relaxed. Louis seemed to be once more reconciled with France, and\r\nFrance was relieved from the ban of Europe. The Emperor announced that the\r\ncircumstances which had provoked the Declaration of Pillnitz no longer\r\nexisted, and that the Powers, though prepared to revive the League if\r\nfuture occasion should arise, suspended all joint action in reference to\r\nthe internal affairs of France.\r\n\r\n[Priests and emigrants keep France in agitation.]\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly, which, in two years, had carried France so far\r\ntowards the goal of political and social freedom, now declared its work\r\nended. In the mass of the nation there was little desire for further\r\nchange. The grievances which pressed most heavily upon the common course of\r\nmen's lives--unfair taxation, exclusion from public employment, monopolies\r\namong the townspeople, and the feudal dues which consumed the produce of\r\nthe peasant--had been swept away. It was less by any general demand for\r\nfurther reform than by the antagonisms already kindled in the Revolution\r\nthat France was forced into a new series of violent changes. The King\r\nhimself was not sincerely at one with the nation; in everything that most\r\nkeenly touched his conscience he had unwillingly accepted the work of the\r\nAssembly. The Church and the noblesse were bent on undoing what had already\r\nbeen done. Without interfering with doctrine or ritual, the National\r\nAssembly had re-organised the ecclesiastical system of France, and had\r\nenforced that supremacy of the State over the priesthood to which,\r\nthroughout the eighteenth century, the Governments of Catholic Europe had\r\nbeen steadily tending. The Civil Constitution of the Clergy, which was\r\ncreated by the National Assembly in 1790, transformed the priesthood from a\r\nsociety of landowners into a body of salaried officers of the State, and\r\ngave to the laity the election of their bishops and ministers. The change,\r\ncarried out in this extreme form, threw the whole body of bishops and a\r\ngreat part of the lower clergy into revolt. Their interests were hurt by\r\nthe sale of the Church lands; their consciences were wounded by the system\r\nof popular election, which was condemned by the Pope. In half the pulpits\r\nof France the principles of the Revolution were anathematised, and the\r\nvengeance of heaven denounced against the purchasers of the secularised\r\nChurch lands. Beyond the frontier the emigrant nobles, who might have\r\ntempered the Revolution by combining with the many liberal men of their\r\norder who remained at home, gathered in arms, and sought the help of\r\nforeigners against a nation in which they could see nothing but rebellious\r\ndependents of their own. The head-quarters of the emigrants were at\r\nCoblentz in the dominions of the Elector of Trèves. They formed themselves\r\ninto regiments, numbering in all some few thousands, and occupied\r\nthemselves with extravagant schemes of vengeance against all Frenchmen who\r\nhad taken part in the destruction of the privileges of their caste.\r\n\r\n[Legislative Assembly. Oct. 1791.]\r\n\r\n[War policy of the Gironde.]\r\n\r\nHad the elections which followed the dissolution of the National Assembly\r\nsent to the Legislature a body of men bent only on maintaining the\r\nadvantages already won, it would have been no easy task to preserve the\r\npeace of France in the presence of the secret or open hostility of the\r\nCourt, the Church, and the emigrants. But the trial was not made. The\r\nleading spirits among the new representatives were not men of compromise.\r\nIn the Legislative Body which met in 1791 there were all the passions of\r\nthe Assembly of 1789, without any of the experience which that Assembly had\r\ngained. A decree, memorable among the achievements of political folly, had\r\nprohibited members of the late Chamber from seeking re-election. The new\r\nLegislature was composed of men whose political creed had been drawn almost\r\nwholly from literary sources; the most dangerous theorists of the former\r\nAssembly were released from Parliamentary restraints, and installed, like\r\nRobespierre, as the orators of the clubs. Within the Chamber itself the\r\ndefenders of the Monarchy and of the Constitution which had just been given\r\nto France were far outmatched by the party of advance. The most conspicuous\r\nof the new deputies formed the group named after the district of the\r\nGironde, where several of their leaders had been elected. The orator\r\nVergniaud, pre-eminent among companions of singular eloquence, the\r\nphilosopher Condorcet, the veteran journalist Brissot, gave to this party\r\nan ascendancy in the Chamber and an influence in the country the more\r\ndangerous because it appeared to belong to men elevated above the ordinary\r\nregions of political strife. Without the fixed design of turning the\r\nmonarchy into a republic, the orators of the Gironde sought to carry the\r\nrevolutionary movement over the barrier erected against it in the\r\nConstitution of 1791. From the moment of the opening of the Assembly it was\r\nclear that the Girondins intended to precipitate the conflict between the\r\nCourt and the nation by devoting all the wealth of their eloquence to the\r\nsubjects which divided France the most. To Brissot and the men who\r\nfurnished the ideas of the party, it would have seemed a calamity that the\r\nConstitution of 1791, with its respect for the prerogative of the Crown and\r\nits tolerance of mediæval superstition, should fairly get underway. In\r\nspite of Robespierre's prediction that war would give France a strong\r\nsovereign in the place of a weak one, the Girondins persuaded themselves\r\nthat the best means of diminishing or overthrowing monarchical power in\r\nFrance was a war with the sovereigns of Europe; and henceforward they\r\nlaboured for war with scarcely any disguise. [5]\r\n\r\n[Notes of Kaunitz, Dec. 21, Feb. 17.]\r\n\r\nNor were occasions wanting, if war was needful for France. The protection\r\nwhich the Elector of Trèves gave to the emigrant army at Coblentz was so\r\nflagrant a violation of international law that the Gironde had the support\r\nof the whole nation when they called upon the King to demand the dispersal\r\nof the emigrants in the most peremptory form. National feeling was keenly\r\nexcited by debates in which the military preparations of the emigrants and\r\nthe encouragement given to them by foreign princes were denounced with all\r\nthe energy of southern eloquence. On the 13th of December Louis declared to\r\nthe Electors of Trèves and Mainz that he would treat them as enemies unless\r\nthe armaments within their territories were dispersed by January 15th; and\r\nat the same time he called upon the Emperor Leopold, as head of the\r\nGermanic body, to use his influence in bringing the Electors to reason. The\r\ndemands of France were not resisted. On the 16th January, 1792, Louis\r\ninformed the Assembly that the emigrants had been expelled from the\r\nelectorates, and acknowledged the good offices of Leopold in effecting this\r\nresult. The substantial cause of war seemed to have disappeared; but\r\nanother had arisen in its place. In a note of December 21st the Austrian\r\nMinister Kaunitz used expressions which implied that a league of the Powers\r\nwas still in existence against France. Nothing could have come more\r\nopportunely for the war-party in the Assembly. Brissot cried for an\r\nimmediate declaration of war, and appealed to the French nation to\r\nvindicate its honour by an attack both upon the emigrants and upon their\r\nimperial protector. The issue depended upon the relative power of the Crown\r\nand the Opposition. Leopold saw that war was inevitable unless the\r\nConstitutional party, which was still in office, rallied for one last\r\neffort, and gained a decisive victory over its antagonists. In the hope of\r\nturning public opinion against the Gironde, he permitted Kaunitz to send a\r\ndespatch to Paris which loaded the leaders of the war-party with abuse, and\r\nexhorted the French nation to deliver itself from men who would bring upon\r\nit the hostility of Europe. (Feb. 17.) [6] The despatch gave singular proof\r\nof the inability of the cleverest sovereign and the most experienced\r\nminister of the age to distinguish between the fears of a timid cabinet and\r\nthe impulses of an excited nation. Leopold's vituperations might have had\r\nthe intended effect if they had been addressed to the Margrave of Baden or\r\nthe Doge of Venice; addressed to the French nation and its popular Assembly\r\nin the height of civil conflict, they were as oil poured upon the flames.\r\nLeopold ruined the party which he meant to reinforce; he threw the nation\r\ninto the arms of those whom he attacked. His despatch was received in the\r\nAssembly with alternate murmurs and bursts of laughter; in the clubs it\r\nexcited a wild outburst of rage. The exchange of diplomatic notes continued\r\nfor a few weeks more; but the real answer of France to Austria was the\r\n\"Marseillaise,\" composed at Strasburg almost simultaneously with Kaunitz'\r\nattack upon the Jacobins. The sudden death of the Emperor on March 1st\r\nproduced no pause in the controversy. Delessart, the Foreign Minister of\r\nLouis, was thrust from office, and replaced by Dumouriez, the\r\nrepresentative of the war-party.\r\n\r\n[War declared, April 20th, 1792.]\r\n\r\nExpostulation took a sharper tone; old subjects of complaint were revived;\r\nand the armies on each side were already pressing towards the frontier when\r\nthe unhappy Louis was brought down to the Assembly by his Ministers, and\r\ncompelled to propose the declaration of war.\r\n\r\n[Pretended grounds of war.]\r\n\r\n[Expectation of foreign attack real among the French people; not real among\r\nthe French politicians.]\r\n\r\nIt is seldom that the professed grounds correspond with the real motives of\r\na war; nor was this the case in 1792. The ultimatum of the Austrian\r\nGovernment demanded that compensation should be made to certain German\r\nnobles whose feudal rights over their peasantry had been abolished in\r\nAlsace; that the Pope should be indemnified for Avignon and the Venaissin,\r\nwhich had been taken from him by France; and that a Government should be\r\nestablished at Paris capable of affording the Powers of Europe security\r\nagainst the spread of democratic agitation. No one supposed the first two\r\ngrievances to be a serious ground for hostilities. The rights of the German\r\nnobles in Alsace over their villagers were no doubt protected by the\r\ntreaties which ceded those districts to France; but every politician in\r\nEurope would have laughed at a Government which allowed the feudal system\r\nto survive in a corner of its dominions out of respect for a settlement a\r\ncentury and a half old: nor had the Assembly refused to these foreign\r\nseigneurs a compensation claimed in vain by King Louis for the nobles of\r\nFrance. As to the annexation of Avignon and the Venaissin, a power which,\r\nlike Austria, had joined in dismembering Poland, and had just made an\r\nunsuccessful attempt to dismember Turkey, could not gravely reproach France\r\nfor incorporating a district which lay actually within it, and whose\r\ninhabitants, or a great portion of them, were anxious to become citizens of\r\nFrance. The third demand, the establishment of such a government as Austria\r\nshould deem satisfactory, was one which no high-spirited people could be\r\nexpected to entertain. Nor was this, in fact, expected by Austria. Leopold\r\nhad no desire to attack France, but he had used threats, and would not\r\nsubmit to the humiliation of renouncing them. He would not have begun a war\r\nfor the purpose of delivering the French Crown; but, when he found that he\r\nwas himself certain to be attacked, he accepted a war with the Revolution\r\nwithout regret. On the other side, when the Gironde denounced the league of\r\nthe Kings, they exaggerated a far-off danger for the ends of their domestic\r\npolicy. The Sovereigns of the Continent had indeed made no secret of their\r\nhatred to the Revolution. Catherine of Russia had exhorted every Court in\r\nEurope to make war; Gustavus of Sweden was surprised by a violent death in\r\nthe midst of preparations against France; Spain, Naples, and Sardinia were\r\nready to follow leaders stronger than themselves. But the statesmen of the\r\nFrench Assembly well understood the interval that separates hostile feeling\r\nfrom actual attack; and the unsubstantial nature of the danger to France,\r\nwhether from the northern or the southern Powers, was proved by the very\r\nfact that Austria, the hereditary enemy of France, and the country of the\r\nhated Marie Antoinette, was treated as the main enemy. Nevertheless, the\r\nCourts had done enough to excite the anger of millions of French people who\r\nknew of their menaces, and not of their hesitations and reserves. The man\r\nwho composed the \"Marseillaise\" was no maker of cunningly-devised fables;\r\nthe crowds who first sang it never doubted the reality of the dangers which\r\nthe orators of the Assembly denounced. The Courts of Europe had heaped up\r\nthe fuel; the Girondins applied the torch. The mass of the French nation\r\nhad little means of appreciating what passed in Europe; they took their\r\nfacts from their leaders, who considered it no very serious thing to plunge\r\na nation into war for the furtherance of internal liberty. Events were soon\r\nto pass their own stern and mocking sentence upon the wisdom of the\r\nGirondin statesmanship.\r\n\r\n[Germany follows Austria into the war.]\r\n\r\n[State of Germany.]\r\n\r\nAfter voting the Declaration of War the French Assembly accepted a\r\nmanifesto, drawn up by Condorcet, renouncing in the name of the French\r\npeople all intention of conquest. The manifesto expressed what was\r\nsincerely felt by men like Condorcet, to whom the Revolution was still too\r\nsacred a cause to be stained with the vulgar lust of aggrandisement. But\r\nthe actual course of the war was determined less by the intentions with\r\nwhich the French began it than by the political condition of the States\r\nwhich bordered upon the French frontier. The war was primarily a war with\r\nAustria, but the Sovereign of Austria was also the head of Germany. The\r\nGerman Ecclesiastical Princes who ruled in the Rhenish provinces had been\r\nthe most zealous protectors of the emigrants; it was impossible that they\r\nshould now find shelter in neutrality. Prussia had made an alliance with\r\nthe Emperor against France; other German States followed in the wake of one\r\nor other of the great Powers. If France proved stronger than its enemy,\r\nthere were governments besides that of Austria which would have to take\r\ntheir account with the Revolution. Nor indeed was Austria the power most\r\nexposed to violent change. The mass of its territory lay far from France;\r\nat the most, it risked the loss of Lombardy and the Netherlands. Germany at\r\nlarge was the real area threatened by the war, and never was a political\r\ncommunity less fitted to resist attack than Germany at the end of the\r\neighteenth century. It was in the divisions of the German people, and in\r\nthe rivalries of the two leading German governments, that France found its\r\nsurest support throughout the Revolutionary war, and its keenest stimulus\r\nto conquest. It will throw light upon the sudden changes that now began to\r\nbreak over Europe if we pause to make a brief survey of the state of\r\nGermany at the outbreak of the war, to note the character and policy of its\r\nreigning sovereigns, and to cast a glance over the circumstances which had\r\nbrought the central district of Europe into its actual condition.\r\n\r\n[Since 1648, all the German States independent of the Emperor.]\r\n\r\n[Holy Roman Empire.]\r\n\r\nGermany at large still preserved the mediæval name and forms of the Holy\r\nRoman Empire. The members of this so-called Empire were, however, a\r\nmultitude of independent States; and the chief of these States, Austria,\r\ncombined with its German provinces a large territory which did not even in\r\nname form part of the Germanic body. The motley of the Empire was made up\r\nby governments of every degree of strength and weakness. Austria and\r\nPrussia possessed both political traditions and resources raising them to\r\nthe rank of great European Powers; but the sovereignties of the second\r\norder, such as Saxony and Bavaria, had neither the security of strength nor\r\nthe free energy often seen in small political communities; whilst in the\r\nremaining petty States of Germany, some hundreds in number, all public life\r\nhad long passed out of mind in a drowsy routine of official benevolence or\r\noppression. In theory there still existed a united Germanic body; in\r\nreality Germany was composed of two great monarchies in embittered rivalry\r\nwith one another, and of a multitude of independent principalities and\r\ncities whose membership in the Empire involved little beyond a liability to\r\nbe dragged into the quarrels of their more powerful neighbours. A German\r\nnational feeling did not exist, because no combination existed uniting the\r\ninterests of all Germany. The names and forms of political union had come\r\ndown from a remote past, and formed a grotesque anachronism amid the\r\nrealities of the eighteenth century. The head of the Germanic body held\r\noffice not by hereditary right, but as the elected successor of Charlemagne\r\nand the Roman Cæsars. Since the fifteenth century the imperial dignity had\r\nrested with the Austrian House of Hapsburg; but, with the exception of\r\nCharles V., no sovereign of that House had commanded forces adequate to the\r\ncreation of a united German state, and the opportunity which then offered\r\nitself was allowed to pass away. The Reformation severed Northern Germany\r\nfrom the Catholic monarchy of the south. The Thirty Years' War, terminating\r\nin the middle of the seventeenth century, secured the existence of\r\nProtestantism on the Continent of Europe, but it secured it at the cost of\r\nGermany, which was left exhausted and disintegrated. By the Treaty of\r\nWestphalia, A.D. 1648, the independence of every member of the Empire was\r\nrecognised, and the central authority was henceforth a mere shadow. The\r\nDiet of the Empire, where the representatives of the Electors, of the\r\nPrinces, and of the Free Cities, met in the order of the Middle Ages, sank\r\ninto a Heralds' College, occupied with questions of title and precedence;\r\naffairs of real importance were transacted by envoys from Court to Court.\r\nFor purposes of war the Empire was divided into Circles, each Circle\r\nsupplying in theory a contingent of troops; but this military organisation\r\nexisted only in letter. The greater and the intermediate States regulated\r\ntheir armaments, as they did their policy, without regard to the Diet of\r\nRatisbon; the contingents of the smaller sovereignties and free cities were\r\nin every degree of inefficiency, corruption, and disorder; and in spite of\r\nthe courage of the German soldier, it could make little difference in a\r\nEuropean war whether a regiment which had its captain appointed by the city\r\nof Gmünd, its lieutenant by the Abbess of Rotenmünster, and its ensign by\r\nthe Abbot of Gegenbach, did or did not take the field with numbers fifty\r\nper cent. below its statutory contingent. [7] How loose was the connection\r\nsubsisting between the members of the Empire, how slow and cumbrous its\r\nconstitutional machinery, was strikingly proved after the first inroads of\r\nthe French into Germany in 1792, when the Diet deliberated for four weeks\r\nbefore calling out the forces of the Empire, and for five months before\r\ndeclaring war.\r\n\r\n[Austria.]\r\n\r\n[Catholic policy of the Hapsburgs.]\r\n\r\nThe defence of Germany rested in fact with the armies of Austria and\r\nPrussia. The Austrian House of Hapsburg held the imperial title, and\r\ngathered around it the sovereigns of the less progressive German States.\r\nWhile the Protestant communities of Northern Germany identified their\r\ninterests with those of the rising Prussian Monarchy, religious sympathy\r\nand the tradition of ages attached the minor Catholic Courts to the\r\npolitical system of Vienna. Austria gained something by its patronage; it\r\nwas, however, no real member of the German family. Its interests were not\r\nthe interests of Germany; its power, great and enduring as it proved, was\r\nnot based mainly upon German elements, nor used mainly for German ends. The\r\ntitle of the Austrian monarch gave the best idea of the singular variety of\r\nraces and nationalities which owed their political union only to their\r\nsubmission to a common head. In the shorter form of state the reigning\r\nHapsburg was described as King of Hungary, Bohemia, Croatia, Slavonia, and\r\nGalicia; Archduke of Austria; Grand Duke of Transylvania; Duke of Styria,\r\nCarinthia, and Carniola; and Princely Count of Hapsburg and Tyrol. At the\r\noutbreak of the war of 1792 the dominions of the House of Austria included\r\nthe Southern Netherlands and the Duchy of Milan, in addition to the great\r\nbulk of the territory which it still governs. Eleven distinct languages\r\nwere spoken in the Austrian monarchy, with countless varieties of dialects.\r\nOf the elements of the population the Slavic was far the largest, numbering\r\nabout ten millions, against five million Germans and three million Magyars;\r\nbut neither numerical strength nor national objects of desire coloured the\r\npolicy of a family which looked indifferently upon all its subject races as\r\ninstruments for its own aggrandisement. Milan and the Netherlands had come\r\ninto the possession of Austria since the beginning of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, but the destiny of the old dominions of the Hapsburg House had\r\nbeen fixed for many generations in the course of the Thirty Years' War. In\r\nthat struggle, as it affected Austria, the conflict of the ancient and the\r\nreformed faith had become a conflict between the Monarchy, allied with the\r\nChurch, and every element of national life and independence, allied with\r\nthe Reformation. Protestantism, then dominant in almost all the Hapsburg\r\nterritories, was not put down without extinguishing the political liberties\r\nof Austrian Germany, the national life of Bohemia, the spirit and ambition\r\nof the Hungarian nobles. The detestable desire of the Emperor Ferdinand,\r\n\"Rather a desert than a country full of heretics,\" was only too well\r\nfulfilled in the subsequent history of his dominions. In the German\r\nprovinces, except the Tyrol, the old Parliaments, and with them all trace\r\nof liberty, disappeared; in Bohemia the national Protestant nobility lost\r\ntheir estates, or retained them only at the price of abandoning the\r\nreligion, the language, and the feelings of their race, until the country\r\nof Huss passed out of the sight of civilised Europe, and Bohemia\r\nrepresented no more than a blank, unnoticed mass of tillers of the soil. In\r\nHungary, where the nation was not so completely crushed in the Thirty\r\nYears' War, and Protestantism survived, the wholesale executions in 1686,\r\nordered by the Tribunal known as the \"Slaughter-house of Eperies,\"\r\nillustrated the traditional policy of the Monarchy towards the spirit of\r\nnational independence. Two powers alone were allowed to subsist in the\r\nAustrian dominions, the power of the Crown and the power of the Priesthood;\r\nand, inasmuch as no real national unity could exist among the subject\r\nraces, the unity of a blind devotion to the Catholic Church was enforced\r\nover the greater part of the Monarchy by all the authority of the State.\r\n\r\n[Reforms of Maria Theresa, 1740-1780.]\r\n\r\nUnder the pressure of this soulless despotism the mind of man seemed to\r\nlose all its finer powers. The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, in\r\nwhich no decade passed in England and France without the production of some\r\nliterary masterpiece, some scientific discovery, or some advance in\r\npolitical reasoning, are marked by no single illustrious Austrian name,\r\nexcept that of Haydn the musician. When, after three generations of torpor\r\nsucceeding the Thirty Years' War, the mind of North Germany awoke again in\r\nWinckelmann and Lessing, and a widely-diffused education gave to the middle\r\nclass some compensation for the absence of all political freedom, no trace\r\nof this revival appeared in Austria. The noble hunted and slept; the serf\r\ntoiled heavily on; where a school existed, the Jesuit taught his schoolboys\r\necclesiastical Latin, and sent them away unable to read their\r\nmother-tongue. To this dull and impenetrable society the beginnings of\r\nimprovement could only be brought by military disaster. The loss of Silesia\r\nin the first years of Maria Theresa disturbed the slumbers of the\r\nGovernment, and reform began. Although the old provincial Assemblies,\r\nexcept in Hungary and the Netherlands, had long lost all real power, the\r\nCrown had never attempted to create a uniform system of administration: the\r\ncollection of taxes, the enlistment of recruits, was still the business of\r\nthe feudal landowners of each district. How such an antiquated order was\r\nlikely to fare in the presence of an energetic enemy was clearly enough\r\nshown in the first attack made upon Austria by Frederick the Great. As the\r\nbasis of a better military organisation, and in the hope of arousing a\r\nstronger national interest among her subjects, Theresa introduced some of\r\nthe offices of a centralised monarchy, at the same time that she improved\r\nthe condition of the serf, and substituted a German education and German\r\nschoolmasters for those of the Jesuits. The peasant, hitherto in many parts\r\nof the monarchy attached to the soil, was now made free to quit his lord's\r\nland, and was secured from ejectment so long as he fulfilled his duty of\r\nlabouring for the lord on a fixed number of days in the year. Beyond this\r\nTheresa's reform did not extend. She had no desire to abolish the feudal\r\ncharacter of country life; she neither wished to temper the sway of\r\nCatholicism, nor to extinguish those provincial forms which gave to the\r\nnobles within their own districts a shadow of political independence.\r\nHerself conservative in feeling, attached to aristocracy, and personally\r\ndevout, Theresa consented only to such change as was recommended by her\r\ntrusted counsellors, and asked no more than she was able to obtain by the\r\ncharm of her own queenly character.\r\n\r\n[Joseph II., 1780-1790.]\r\n\r\nWith the accession of her son Joseph II. in 1780 a new era began for\r\nAustria. The work deferred by Theresa was then taken up by a monarch whose\r\nconceptions of social and religious reform left little for the boldest\r\ninnovators of France ten years later to add. There is no doubt that the\r\ncreation of a great military force for enterprises of foreign conquest was\r\nan end always present in Joseph's mind, and that the thirst for\r\nuncontrolled despotic power never left him; but by the side of these\r\ncoarser elements there was in Joseph's nature something of the true fire of\r\nthe man who lives for ideas. Passionately desirous of elevating every class\r\nof his subjects at the same time that he ignored all their habits and\r\nwishes, Joseph attempted to transform the motley and priest-ridden\r\ncollection of nations over whom he ruled into a single homogeneous body,\r\norganised after the model of France and Prussia, worshipping in the spirit\r\nof a tolerant and enlightened Christianity, animated in its relations of\r\nclass to class by the humane philosophy of the eighteenth century. In the\r\nfirst year of his reign Joseph abolished every jurisdiction that did not\r\ndirectly emanate from the Crown, and scattered an army of officials from\r\nOstend to the Dniester to conduct the entire public business of his\r\ndominions under the immediate direction of the central authority at Vienna.\r\nIn succeeding years edict followed edict, dissolving monasteries,\r\nforbidding Church festivals and pilgrimages, securing the protection of the\r\nState to every form of Christian worship, abolishing the exemption from\r\nland-tax and the monopoly of public offices enjoyed by the nobility,\r\ntransforming the Universities from dens of monkish ignorance into schools\r\nof secular learning, converting the peasant's personal service into a\r\nrent-charge, and giving him in the officer of the Crown a protector and an\r\narbiter in all his dealings with his lord. Noble and enlightened in his\r\naims, Joseph, like every other reformer of the eighteenth century,\r\nunderrated the force which the past exerts over the present; he could see\r\nnothing but prejudice and unreason in the attachment to provincial custom\r\nor time-honoured opinion; he knew nothing of that moral law which limits\r\nthe success of revolutions by the conditions which precede them. What was\r\nworst united with what was best in resistance to his reforms. The bigots of\r\nthe University of Louvain, who still held out against the discoveries of\r\nNewton, excited the mob to insurrection against Joseph, as the enemy of\r\nreligion; the Magyar landowners in Hungary resisted a system which\r\nextinguished the last vestiges of their national independence at the same\r\ntime that it destroyed the harsh dominion which they themselves exercised\r\nover their peasantry. Joseph alternated between concession and the extreme\r\nof autocratic violence. At one moment he resolved to sweep away every local\r\nright that fettered the exercise of his power; then, after throwing the\r\nNetherlands into successful revolt, and forcing Hungary to the verge of\r\narmed resistance, he revoked his unconstitutional ordinances (January 28,\r\n1790), and restored all the institutions of the Hungarian monarchy which\r\nexisted at the date of his accession.\r\n\r\n[Leopold II., 1790-1792.]\r\n\r\nA month later, death removed Joseph from his struggle and his sorrows. His\r\nsuccessor, Leopold II., found the monarchy involved as Russia's ally in an\r\nattack upon Turkey; threatened by the Northern League of Prussia, England,\r\nand Holland; exhausted in finance; weakened by the revolt of the\r\nNetherlands; and distracted in every province by the conflict of the\r\nancient and the modern system of government, and the assertion of new\r\nsocial rights that seemed to have been created only in order to be\r\nextinguished. The recovery of Belgium and the conclusion of peace with\r\nTurkey were effected under circumstances that brought the adroit and\r\nguarded statesmanship of Leopold into just credit. His settlement of the\r\nconflict between the Crown and the Provinces, between the Church and\r\neducation, between the noble and the serf, marked the line in which, for\r\nbetter or for worse, Austrian policy was to run for sixty years. Provincial\r\nrights, the privileges of orders and corporate bodies, Leopold restored;\r\nthe personal sovereignty of his house he maintained unimpaired. In the more\r\nliberal part of Joseph's legislation, the emancipation of learning from\r\nclerical control, the suppression of unjust privilege in taxation, the\r\nabolition of the feudal services of the peasant, Leopold was willing to\r\nmake concessions to the Church and the aristocracy; to the spirit of\r\nnational independence which his predecessor's aggression had excited in\r\nBohemia as well as in Hungary, he made no concession beyond the restoration\r\nof certain cherished forms. An attempt of the Magyar nobles to affix\r\nconditions to their acknowledgment of Leopold as King of Hungary was\r\ndefeated; and, by creating new offices at Vienna for the affairs of Illyria\r\nand Transylvania, and making them independent of the Hungarian Diet,\r\nLeopold showed that the Crown possessed an instrument against the dominant\r\nMagyar race in the Slavic and Romanic elements of the Hungarian Kingdom.\r\n[8] On the other hand, Leopold consented to restore to the Church its\r\ncontrol over the higher education, and to throw back the burden of taxation\r\nupon land not occupied by noble owners. He gave new rigour to the\r\ncensorship of the press; but the gain was not to the Church, to which the\r\ncensorship had formerly belonged, but to the Government, which now employed\r\nit as an instrument of State. In the great question of the emancipation of\r\nthe serf Leopold was confronted by a more resolute and powerful body of\r\nnobility in Hungary than existed in any other province. The right of the\r\nlord to fetter the peasant to the soil and to control his marriage Leopold\r\nrefused to restore in any part of his dominions; but, while in parts of\r\nBohemia he succeeded in maintaining the right given by Joseph to the\r\npeasant to commute his personal service for a money payment, in Hungary he\r\nwas compelled to fall back upon the system of Theresa, and to leave the\r\nfinal settlement of the question to the Diet. Twenty years later the\r\nstatesman who emancipated the peasants of Prussia observed that Hungary was\r\nthe only part of the Austrian dominions in which the peasant was not in a\r\nbetter condition than his fellows in North Germany; [9] and so torpid was\r\nthe humanity of the Diet that until the year 1835 the prison and the\r\nflogging-board continued to form a part of every Hungarian manor.\r\n\r\n[Death of Leopold, March 1, 1792.]\r\n\r\n[Francis II., 1792.]\r\n\r\nOf the self-sacrificing ardour of Joseph there was no trace in Leopold's\r\ncharacter; yet his political aims were not low. During twenty-four years'\r\ngovernment of Tuscany he had proved himself almost an ideal ruler in the\r\npursuit of peace, of religious enlightenment, and of the material\r\nimprovement of his little sovereignty. Raised to the Austrian throne, the\r\ncompromise which he effected with the Church and the aristocracy resulted\r\nmore from a supposed political necessity than from his own inclination. So\r\nlong as Leopold lived, Austria would not have wanted an intelligence\r\ncapable of surveying the entire field of public business, nor a will\r\ncapable of imposing unity of action upon the servants of State. To the\r\nmisfortune of Europe no less than of his own dominions, Leopold was carried\r\noff by sickness at the moment when the Revolutionary War broke out. An\r\nuneasy reaction against Joseph's reforms and a well-grounded dread of the\r\nnational movements in Hungary and the Netherlands were already the\r\nprincipal forces in the official world at Vienna; in addition to these came\r\nthe new terror of the armed proselytism of the Revolution. The successor of\r\nLeopold, Francis II., was a sickly prince, in whose homely and\r\nunimaginative mind the great enterprises of Joseph, amidst which he had\r\nbeen brought up, excited only aversion. Amongst the men who surrounded him,\r\nroutine and the dread of change made an end of the higher forms of public\r\nlife. The Government openly declared that all change should cease so long\r\nas the war lasted; even the pressing question of the peasant's relation to\r\nhis lord was allowed to remain unsettled by the Hungarian Diet, lest the\r\nspirit of national independence should find expression in its debates. Over\r\nthe whole internal administration of Austria the torpor of the days before\r\nTheresa seemed to be returning. Its foreign policy, however, bore no trace\r\nof this timorous, conservative spirit. Joseph, as restless abroad as at\r\nhome, had shared the ambition of the Russian Empress Catherine, and\r\ntroubled Europe with his designs upon Turkey, Venice, and Bavaria. These\r\nand similar schemes of territorial extension continued to fill the minds of\r\nAustrian courtiers and ambassadors. Shortly after the outbreak of war with\r\nFrance the aged minister Kaunitz, who had been at the head of the Foreign\r\nOffice during three reigns, retired from power. In spite of the first\r\npartition of Poland, made in combination with Russia and Prussia in 1772,\r\nand in spite of subsequent attempts of Joseph against Turkey and Bavaria,\r\nthe policy of Kaunitz had not been one of mere adventure and shifting\r\nattack. He had on the whole remained true to the principle of alliance with\r\nFrance and antagonism to Prussia; and when the revolution brought war\r\nwithin sight, he desired to limit the object of the war to the restoration\r\nof monarchical government in France. The conditions under which the young\r\nEmperor and the King of Prussia agreed to turn the war to purposes of\r\nterritorial aggrandisement caused Kaunitz, with a true sense of the fatal\r\nimport of this policy, to surrender the power which he had held for forty\r\nyears. It was secretly agreed between the two courts that Prussia should\r\nrecoup itself for its expenses against France by seizing part of Poland. On\r\nbehalf of Austria it was demanded that the Emperor should annex Bavaria,\r\ngiving Belgium to the Elector as compensation. Both these schemes violated\r\nwhat Kaunitz held to be sound policy. He believed that the interests of\r\nAustria required the consolidation rather than the destruction of Poland;\r\nand he declared the exchange of the Netherlands for Bavaria to be, in the\r\nactual state of affairs, impracticable. [10] Had the coalition of 1792 been\r\nframed on the principles advocated by Kaunitz, though Austria might not\r\nhave effected the restoration of monarchial power in France, the alliance\r\nwould not have disgracefully shattered on the crimes and infamies attending\r\nthe second partition of Poland.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment when Kaunitz retired from office, territorial extension\r\nbecame the great object of the Austrian Court. To prudent statesmen the\r\nscattered provinces and varied population of the Austrian State would have\r\nsuggested that Austria had more to lose than any European Power; to the men\r\nof 1792 it appeared that she had more to gain. The Netherlands might be\r\nincreased with a strip of French Flanders; Bavaria, Poland, and Italy were\r\nall weak neighbours, who might be made to enrich Austria in their turn. A\r\nsort of magical virtue was attached to the acquisition of territory. If so\r\nmany square miles and so many head of population were gained, whether of\r\nalien or kindred race, mutinous or friendly, the end of all statesmanship\r\nwas realised, and the heaviest sacrifice of life and industry repaid.\r\nAustria affected to act as the centre of a defensive alliance, and to fight\r\nfor the common purpose of giving a Government to France which would respect\r\nthe rights of its neighbours. In reality, its own military operations were\r\ntoo often controlled, and an effective common warfare frustrated, at one\r\nmoment by a design upon French Flanders, at another by the course of Polish\r\nor Bavarian intrigue, at another by the hope of conquests in Italy. Of all\r\nthe interests which centred in the head of the House of Hapsburg, the least\r\nbefriended at Vienna was the interest of the Empire and of Germany.\r\n\r\n[Prussia.]\r\n\r\nNor, if Austria was found wanting, had Germany any permanent safeguard in\r\nthe rival Protestant State. Prussia, the second great German Power and the\r\nancient enemy of Austria, had been raised to an influence in Europe quite\r\nout of proportion to its scanty resources by the genius of Frederick the\r\nGreat and the earlier Princes of the House of Hohenzollern. Its population\r\nwas not one-third of that of France or Austria; its wealth was perhaps not\r\nsuperior to that of the Republic of Venice. That a State so poor in men and\r\nmoney should play the part of one of the great Powers of Europe was\r\npossible only so long as an energetic ruler watched every movement of that\r\ncomplicated machinery which formed both army and nation after the prince's\r\nown type. Frederick gave his subjects a just administration of the law; he\r\ntaught them productive industries; he sought to bring education to their\r\ndoors [11]; but he required that the citizen should account himself before\r\nall the servant of the State. Every Prussian either worked in the great\r\nofficial hierarchy or looked up to it as the providence which was to direct\r\nall his actions and supply all his judgments. The burden of taxation\r\nimposed by the support of an army relatively three times as great as that\r\nof any other Power was wonderfully lightened by Frederick's economy: far\r\nmore serious than the tobacco-monopoly and the forage-requisitions, at\r\nwhich Frederick's subjects grumbled during his life-time, was the danger\r\nthat a nation which had only attained political greatness by its obedience\r\nto a rigorous administration should fall into political helplessness, when\r\nthe clear purpose and all-controlling care of its ruler no longer animated\r\na system which, without him, was only a pedantic routine. What in England\r\nwe are accustomed to consider as the very substance of national life,--the\r\nmass of political interest and opinion, diffused in some degree amongst all\r\nclasses, at once the support and the judge of the servants of the\r\nState,--had in Prussia no existence. Frederick's subjects obeyed and\r\ntrusted their Monarch; there were probably not five hundred persons outside\r\nthe public service who had any political opinions of their own. Prussia did\r\nnot possess even the form of a national representation; and, although\r\ncertain provincial assemblies continued to meet, they met only to receive\r\nthe instructions of the Crown-officers of their district. In the absence of\r\nall public criticism, the old age of Frederick must in itself have\r\nendangered the efficiency of the military system which had raised Prussia\r\nto its sudden eminence. [12] The impulse of Frederick's successor was\r\nsufficient to reverse the whole system of Prussian foreign policy, and to\r\nplunge the country in alliance with Austria into a speculative and\r\nunnecessary war.\r\n\r\n[Frederick William II., 1786.]\r\n\r\n[Alliance with Austria against France, Feb., 1792.]\r\n\r\nOn the death of Frederick in 1786, the crown passed to Frederick William\r\nII., his nephew. Frederick William was a man of common type, showy and\r\npleasure-loving, interested in public affairs, but incapable of acting on\r\nany fixed principle. His mistresses gave the tone to political society. A\r\nknot of courtiers intrigued against one another for the management of the\r\nKing; and the policy of Prussia veered from point to point as one unsteady\r\nimpulse gave place to another. In countries less dependent than Prussia\r\nupon the personal activity of the monarch, Frederick William's faults might\r\nhave been neutralised by able Ministers; in Prussia the weakness of the\r\nKing was the decline of the State. The whole fabric of national greatness\r\nhad been built up by the royal power; the quality of the public service,\r\napart from which the nation was politically non-existent, was the quality\r\nof its head. When in the palace profusion and intrigue took the place of\r\nFrederick the Great's unflagging labour, the old uprightness, industry, and\r\nprecision which had been the pride of Prussian administration fell out of\r\nfashion everywhere. Yet the frivolity of the Court was a less active cause\r\nof military decline than the abandonment of the first principles of\r\nPrussian policy. [13] If any political sentiment existed in the nation, it\r\nwas the sentiment of antagonism to Austria. The patriotism of the army,\r\nwith all the traditions of the great King, turned wholly in this direction.\r\nWhen, out of sympathy with the Bourbon family and the emigrant French\r\nnobles, Frederick William allied himself with Austria (Feb. 1792), and\r\nthrew himself into the arms of his ancient enemy in order to attack a\r\nnation which had not wronged him, he made an end of all zealous obedience\r\namongst his servants. Brunswick, the Prussian Commander-in-Chief, hated the\r\nFrench emigrants as much as he did the Revolution; and even the generals\r\nwho did not originally share Brunswick's dislike to the war recovered their\r\nold jealousy of Austria after the first defeat, and exerted themselves only\r\nto get quit of the war at the first moment that Prussia could retire from\r\nit without disgrace. The very enterprise in which Austria had consented\r\nthat the Court of Berlin should seek its reward--the seizure of a part of\r\nPoland--proved fatal to the coalition. The Empress Catherine was already\r\nlaying her hand for the second time upon this unfortunate country. It was\r\neasy for the opponents of the Austrian alliance who surrounded King\r\nFrederick William to contrast the barren effort of a war against France\r\nwith the cheap and certain advantages to be won by annexation, in concert\r\nwith Russia, of Polish territory. To pursue one of these objects with\r\nvigour it was necessary to relinquish the other. Prussia was not rich\r\nenough to maintain armies both on the Vistula and the Rhine. Nor, in the\r\nopinion of its rulers, was it rich enough to be very tender of its honour\r\nor very loyal towards its allies. [14]\r\n\r\n[Social system of Prussia.]\r\n\r\nIn the institutions of Prussia two opposite systems existed side by side,\r\nexhibiting in the strongest form a contrast which in a less degree was\r\npresent in most Continental States. The political independence of the\r\nnobility had long been crushed; the King's Government busied itself with\r\nevery detail of town and village administration; yet along with this\r\nrigorous development of the modern doctrine of the unity and the authority\r\nof the State there existed a social order more truly archaic than that of\r\nthe Middle Ages at their better epochs. The inhabitants of Prussia were\r\ndivided into the three classes of nobles, burghers, and peasants, each\r\nconfined to its own stated occupations, and not marrying outside its own\r\norder. The soil of the country bore the same distinction; peasant's land\r\ncould not be owned by a burgher; burgher's land could not be owned by a\r\nnoble. No occupation was lawful for the noble, who was usually no more than\r\na poor gentleman, but the service of the Crown; the peasant, even where\r\nfree, might not practise the handicraft of a burgher. But the mass of the\r\npeasantry in the country east of the Elbe were serfs attached to the soil;\r\nand the noble, who was not permitted to exercise the slightest influence\r\nupon the government of his country, inherited along with his manor a\r\njurisdiction and police-control over all who were settled within it.\r\nFrederick had allowed serfage to continue because it gave him in each\r\nmanorial lord a task-master whom he could employ in his own service. System\r\nand obedience were the sources of his power; and if there existed among his\r\nsubjects one class trained to command and another trained to obey, it was\r\nso much the easier for him to force the country into the habits of industry\r\nwhich he required of it. In the same spirit, Frederick officered his army\r\nonly with men of the noble caste. They brought with them the habit of\r\ncommand ready-formed; the peasants who ploughed and threshed at their\r\norders were not likely to disobey them in the presence of the enemy. It was\r\npossible that such a system should produce great results so long as\r\nFrederick was there to guard against its abuses; Frederick gone, the\r\ndegradation of servitude, the insolence of caste, was what remained. When\r\nthe army of France, led by men who had worked with their fathers in the\r\nfields, hunted a King of Prussia amidst his capitulating grandees from the\r\ncentre to the verge of his dominions, it was seen what was the permanent\r\nvalue of a system which recognised in the nature of the poor no capacity\r\nbut one for hereditary subjection. The French peasant, plundered as he was\r\nby the State, and vexed as he was with feudal services, knew no such\r\nbondage as that of the Prussian serf, who might not leave the spot where he\r\nwas born; only in scattered districts in the border-provinces had serfage\r\nsurvived in France. It is significant of the difference in self-respect\r\nexisting in the peasantry of the two countries that the custom of striking\r\nthe common soldier, universal in Germany, was in France no more than an\r\nabuse, practised by the admirers of Frederick, and condemned by the better\r\nofficers themselves.\r\n\r\n[Minor States of Germany.]\r\n\r\n[Ecclesiastical States.]\r\n\r\nIn all the secondary States of Germany the government was an absolute\r\nmonarchy; though, here and there, as in Würtemberg, the shadow of the old\r\nAssembly of the Estates survived; and in Hanover the absence of the\r\nElector, King George III., placed power in the hands of a group of nobles\r\nwho ruled in his name. Society everywhere rested on a sharp division of\r\nclasses similar in kind to that of Prussia; the condition of the peasant\r\nranging from one of serfage, as it existed in Mecklenburg, [15] to one of\r\ncomparative freedom and comfort in parts of the southern and western\r\nStates. The sovereigns differed widely in the enlightenment or selfishness\r\nof their rule; but, on the whole, the character of government had changed\r\nfor the better of late years; and, especially in the Protestant States,\r\nefforts to improve the condition of the people were not wanting. Frederick\r\nthe Great had in fact created a new standard of monarchy in Germany. Forty\r\nyears earlier, Versailles, with its unfeeling splendours, its glorification\r\nof the personal indulgence of the monarch, had been the ideal which, with a\r\ndue sense of their own inferiority, the German princes had done their best\r\nto imitate. To be a sovereign was to cover acres of ground with state\r\napartments, to lavish the revenues of the country upon a troop of\r\nmistresses and adventurers, to patronise the arts, to collect with the same\r\ncomplacency the masterpieces of ancient painting that adorn the Dresden\r\nGallery, or an array of valuables scarcely more interesting than the chests\r\nof treasure that were paid for them. In the ecclesiastical States, headed\r\nby the Electorates of Mainz, Trèves, and Cologne, the affectations of a\r\ndistinctive Christian or spiritual character had long been abandoned. The\r\nprince-bishop and canons, who were nobles appointed from some other\r\nprovince, lived after the gay fashion of the time, at the expense of a land\r\nin which they had no interest extending beyond their own lifetime. The only\r\nfeature distinguishing the ecclesiastical residence from that of one of the\r\nminor secular princes was that the parade of state was performed by monks\r\nin the cathedral instead of by soldiers on the drill-ground, and that even\r\nthe pretence of married life was wanting among the flaunting harpies who\r\nfrequented a celibate Court. Yet even on the Rhine and on the Moselle the\r\ninfluence of the great King of Prussia had begun to make itself felt. The\r\nintense and penetrating industry of Frederick was not within the reach of\r\nevery petty sovereign who might envy its results; but the better spirit of\r\nthe time was seen under some of the ecclesiastical princes in the\r\nencouragement of schools, the improvement of the roads, and a retrenchment\r\nin courtly expenditure. That deeply-seated moral disease which resulted\r\nfrom centuries of priestly rule was not to be so lightly shaken off. In a\r\ndistrict where Nature most bountifully rewards the industry of man,\r\ntwenty-four out of every hundred of the population were monks, nuns, or\r\nbeggars. [16]\r\n\r\n[Petty States. Free Cities. Knights.]\r\n\r\nTwo hundred petty principalities, amongst which Weimar, the home of Goethe,\r\nstood out in the brightest relief from the level of princely routine and\r\nself-indulgence; fifty imperial cities, in most of which the once vigorous\r\norganism of civic life had shrivelled to the type of the English rotten\r\nborough, did not exhaust the divisions of Germany. Several hundred Knights\r\nof the Empire, owing no allegiance except to the Emperor, exercised, each\r\nover a domain averaging from three to four hundred inhabitants, all the\r\nrights of sovereignty, with the exception of the right to make war and\r\ntreaties. The districts in which this order survived were scattered over\r\nthe Catholic States of the south-west of Germany, where the knights\r\nmaintained their prerogatives by federations among themselves and by the\r\nsupport of the Emperor, to whom they granted sums of money. There were\r\ninstances in which this union of the rights of the sovereign and the\r\nlandlord was turned to good account; but the knight's land was usually the\r\nscene of such poverty and degradation that the traveller needed no guide to\r\ninform him when he entered it. Its wretched tracks interrupted the great\r\nlines of communication between the Rhine and further Germany; its hovels\r\nwere the refuge of all the criminals and vagabonds of the surrounding\r\ncountry; for no police existed but the bailiffs of the knight, and the only\r\njurisdiction was that of the lawyer whom the knight brought over from the\r\nnearest town. Nor was the disadvantage only on the side of those who were\r\nthus governed. The knight himself, even if he cherished some traditional\r\nreverence for the shadow of the Empire, was in the position of a man who\r\nbelongs to no real country. If his sons desired any more active career than\r\nthat of annuitants upon the family domains, they could obtain it only by\r\nseeking employment at one or other of the greater Courts, and by\r\nidentifying themselves with the interests of a land which they entered as\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\nSuch was in outline the condition of Germany at the moment when it was\r\nbrought into collision with the new and unknown forces of the French\r\nRevolution. A system of small States, which in the past of Greece and Italy\r\nhad produced the finest types of energy and genius, had in Germany resulted\r\nin the extinction of all vigorous life, and in the ascendancy of all that\r\nwas stagnant, little, and corrupt. If political disorganisation, the decay\r\nof public spirit, and the absence of a national idea, are the signs of\r\nimpending downfall, Germany was ripe for foreign conquest. The obsolete and\r\ndilapidated fabric of the Empire had for a century past been sustained only\r\nby the European tradition of the Balance of Power, or by the absence of\r\nserious attack from without. Austria once overpowered, the Empire was ready\r\nto fall to pieces by itself: and where, among the princes or the people of\r\nGermany, were the elements that gave hope of its renovation in any better\r\nform of national life?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrench and Austrian armies on the Flemish frontier--Prussia enters the\r\nwar--Brunswick invades France--His Proclamation--Insurrection of Aug. 10\r\nat Paris--Massacres of September--Character of the war--Brunswick, checked\r\nat Valmy, retreats--The War becomes a Crusade of France--Neighbours of\r\nFrance--Custine enters Mainz--Dumouriez conquers the Austrian Netherlands\r\n--Nice and Savoy annexed--Decree of the Convention against all Governments\r\n--Execution of Louis XVI.--War with England, followed by war with the\r\nMediterranean States--Condition of England--English Parties, how affected\r\nby the Revolution--The Gironde and the Mountain--Austria recovers the\r\nNetherlands--The Allies invade France--La Vendée--Revolutionary System of\r\n1793--Errors of the Allies--New French Commanders and Democratic Army--\r\nVictories of Jourdan, Hoche, and Pichegru--Prussia withdrawing from the War\r\n--Polish Affairs--Austria abandons the Netherlands--Treaties of\r\nBasle--France in 1795--Insurrection of 13 Vendémiaire--Constitution of\r\n1795--The Directory--Effect of the Revolution on the spirit of Europe up\r\nto 1795.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Fighting on Flemish frontier, April, 1792.]\r\n\r\n[Prussian army invades France, July, 1792. Proclamation.]\r\n\r\nThe war between France and Austria opened in April, 1792, on the Flemish\r\nfrontier. The first encounters were discreditable to the French soldiery,\r\nwho took to flight and murdered one of their generals. The discouragement\r\nwith which the nation heard of these reverses deepened into sullen\r\nindignation against the Court, as weeks and months passed by, and the\r\nforces lay idle on the frontier or met the enemy only in trifling\r\nskirmishes which left both sides where they were before. If at this crisis\r\nof the Revolution, with all the patriotism, all the bravery, all the\r\nmilitary genius of France burning for service, the Government conducted the\r\nwar with results scarcely distinguishable from those of a parade, the\r\nsuggestion of treason on the part of the Court was only too likely to be\r\nentertained. The internal difficulties of the country were increasing. The\r\nAssembly had determined to banish from France the priests who rejected the\r\nnew ecclesiastical system, and the King had placed his veto upon their\r\ndecree. He had refused to permit the formation of a camp of volunteers in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Paris. He had dismissed the popular Ministry forced\r\nupon him by the Gironde. A tumult on the 20th of June, in which the mob\r\nforced their way into the Tuileries, showed the nature of the attack\r\nimpending upon the monarchy if Louis continued to oppose himself to the\r\ndemands of the nation; but the lesson was lost upon the King. Louis was as\r\nlittle able to nerve himself for an armed conflict with the populace as to\r\nreconcile his conscience to the Ecclesiastical Decrees, and he surrendered\r\nhimself to a pious inertia at a moment when the alarm of foreign invasion\r\ndoubled revolutionary passion all over France. Prussia, in pursuance of a\r\ntreaty made in February, united its forces to those of Austria. Forty\r\nthousand Prussian troops, under the Duke of Brunswick, the best of\r\nFrederick's surviving generals, advanced along the Moselle. From Belgium\r\nand the upper Rhine two Austrian armies converged upon the line of\r\ninvasion; and the emigrant nobles were given their place among the forces\r\nof the Allies.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of July the Duke of Brunswick, in the name of the Emperor and\r\nthe King of Prussia, issued a proclamation to the French people, which, but\r\nfor the difference between violent words and violent deeds, would have left\r\nlittle to be complained of in the cruelties that henceforward stained the\r\npopular cause. In this manifesto, after declaring that the Allies entered\r\nFrance in order to deliver Louis from captivity, and that members of the\r\nNational Guard fighting against the invaders would be punished as rebels\r\nagainst their king, the Sovereigns addressed themselves to the city of\r\nParis and to the representatives of the French nation:--\"The city of Paris\r\nand its inhabitants are warned to submit without delay to their King; to\r\nset that Prince at entire liberty, and to show to him and to all the Royal\r\nFamily the inviolability and respect which the law of nature and of nations\r\nimposes on subjects towards their Sovereigns. Their Imperial and Royal\r\nMajesties will hold all the members of the National Assembly, of the\r\nMunicipality, and of the National Guard of Paris responsible for all events\r\nwith their heads, before military tribunals, without hope of pardon. They\r\nfurther declare that, if the Tuileries be forced or insulted, or the least\r\nviolence offered to the King, the Queen, or the Royal Family, and if\r\nprovision be not at once made for their safety and liberty, they will\r\ninflict a memorable vengeance, by delivering up the city of Paris to\r\nmilitary execution and total overthrow, and the rebels guilty of such\r\ncrimes to the punishment they have merited.\" [17]\r\n\r\n[Insurrection August 10, 1792.]\r\n\r\nThis challenge was not necessary to determine the fate of Louis. Since the\r\ncapture of the Bastille in the first days of the Revolution the National\r\nGovernment had with difficulty supported itself against the populace of the\r\ncapital; and, even before the foreigner threatened Paris with fire and\r\nsword, Paris had learnt to look for the will of France within itself. As\r\nthe columns of Brunswick advanced across the north-eastern frontier, Danton\r\nand the leaders of the city-democracy marshalled their army of the poor and\r\nthe desperate to overthrow that monarchy whose cause the invader had made\r\nhis own. The Republic which had floated so long in the thoughts of the\r\nGirondins was won in a single day by the populace of Paris, amid the roar\r\nof cannons and the flash of bayonets. On the 10th of August Danton let\r\nloose the armed mob upon the Tuileries. Louis quitted the Palace without\r\ngiving orders to the guard either to fight or to retire; but the guard were\r\nignorant that their master desired them to offer no resistance, and one\r\nhundred and sixty of the mob were shot down before an order reached the\r\ntroops to abandon the Palace. The cruelties which followed the victory of\r\nthe people indicated the fate in store for those whom the invader came to\r\nprotect. It is doubtful whether the foreign Courts would have made any\r\nserious attempt to undo the social changes effected by the Revolution in\r\nFrance; but no one supposed that those thousands of self-exiled nobles who\r\nnow returned behind the guns of Brunswick had returned in order to take\r\ntheir places peacefully in the new social order. In their own imagination,\r\nas much as in that of the people, they returned with fire and sword to\r\nrepossess themselves of rights of which they had been despoiled, and to\r\ntake vengeance upon the men who were responsible for the changes made in\r\nFrance since 1789. [18] In the midst of a panic little justified by the\r\nreal military situation, Danton inflamed the nation with his own passionate\r\ncourage and resolution; he unhappily also thought it necessary to a\r\nsuccessful national defence that the reactionary party at Paris should be\r\nparalysed by a terrible example. The prisons were filled with persons\r\nsuspected of hostility to the national cause, and in the first days of\r\nSeptember many hundreds of these unfortunate persons were massacred by\r\ngangs of assassins paid by a committee of the Municipality. Danton did not\r\ndisguise his approval of the act. He had made up his mind that the work of\r\nthe Revolution could only be saved by striking terror into its enemies, and\r\nby preventing the Royalists from co-operating with the invader. But the\r\nmultitudes who flocked to the standards of 1792 carried with them the\r\npatriotism of Danton unstained by his guilt. Right or wrong in its origin,\r\nthe war was now unquestionably a just one on the part of France, a war\r\nagainst a privileged class attempting to recover by force the unjust\r\nadvantages that they had not been able to maintain, a war against the\r\nforeigner in defence of the right of the nation to deal with its own\r\ngovernment. Since the great religious wars there had been no cause so\r\nrooted in the hearts, so close to the lives of those who fought for it.\r\nEvery soldier who joined the armies of France in 1792 joined of his own\r\nfree will. No conscription dragged the peasant to the frontier. Men left\r\ntheir homes in order that the fruit of the poor man's labour should be his\r\nown, in order that the children of France should inherit some better\r\nbirthright than exaction and want, in order that the late-won sense of\r\nhuman right should not be swept from the earth by the arms of privilege and\r\ncaste. It was a time of high-wrought hope, of generous and pathetic\r\nself-sacrifice; a time that left a deep and indelible impression upon those\r\nwho judged it as eye-witnesses. Years afterwards the poet Wordsworth, then\r\nalienated from France and cold in the cause of liberty, could not recall\r\nwithout tears the memories of 1792. [19]\r\n\r\n[Brunswick checked at Valmy, Sept. 20.]\r\n\r\n[Retreat of Brunswick.]\r\n\r\nThe defence of France rested on General Dumouriez. The fortresses of Longwy\r\nand Verdun, covering the passage of the Meuse, had fallen after the\r\nbriefest resistance; the troops that could be collected before Brunswick's\r\napproach were too few to meet the enemy in the open field. Happily for\r\nFrance the slow advance of the Prussian general permitted Dumouriez to\r\noccupy the difficult country of the Argonne, where, while waiting for his\r\nreinforcements, he was able for some time to hold the invaders in check. At\r\nlength Brunswick made his way past the defile which Dumouriez had chosen\r\nfor his first line of defence; but it was only to find the French posted in\r\nsuch strength on his flank that any further advance would imperil his own\r\narmy. If the advance was to be continued, Dumouriez must be dislodged.\r\nAccordingly, on the 20th of September, Brunswick directed his artillery\r\nagainst the hills of Valmy, where the French left was encamped. The\r\ncannonade continued for some hours, but it was followed by no general\r\nattack. The firmness of the French under Brunswick's fire made it clear\r\nthat they would not be displaced without an obstinate battle; and,\r\ndisappointed of victory, the King of Prussia began to listen to proposals\r\nof peace sent to him by Dumouriez. [20] A week spent in negotiation served\r\nonly to strengthen the French and to aggravate the scarcity and sickness\r\nwithin the German camp. Dissensions broke out between the Prussian and\r\nAustrian commanders; a retreat was ordered; and to the astonishment of\r\nEurope the veteran forces of Brunswick fell back before the mutinous\r\nsoldiery and unknown generals of the Revolution, powerless to delay for a\r\nsingle month the evacuation of France and the restoration of the fortresses\r\nwhich they had captured.\r\n\r\n[The Convention meets. Proclaims Republic, Sept. 21.]\r\n\r\n[The war becomes a crusade of democracy.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Legislative Assembly had decreed its own dissolution in\r\nconsequence of the overthrow of the monarchy on August both, and had\r\nordered the election of representatives to frame a constitution for France.\r\nThe elections were held in the crisis of invasion, in the height of\r\nnational indignation against the alliance of the aristocracy with the\r\nforeigner, and, in some districts, under the influence of men who had not\r\nshrunk from ordering the massacres in the prisons. At such a moment a\r\nConstitutional Royalist had scarcely more chance of election than a\r\ndetected spy from the enemy's camp. The Girondins, who had been the party\r\nof extremes in the Legislative Assembly, were the party of moderation and\r\norder in the Convention. By their side there were returned men whose whole\r\nbeing seemed to be compounded out of the forces of conflict, men who,\r\nsometimes without conscious depravity, carried into political and social\r\nstruggles that direct, unquestioning employment of force which has\r\nordinarily been reserved for war or for the diffusion of religious\r\ndoctrines. The moral differences that separated this party from the Gironde\r\nwere at once conspicuous: the political creed of the two parties appeared\r\nat first to be much the same. Monarchy was abolished, and France declared a\r\nRepublic (Sept. 21). Office continued in the hands of the Gironde; but the\r\nvehement, uncompromising spirit of their rivals, the so-called party of the\r\nMountain, quickly made itself felt in all the relations of France to\r\nforeign Powers. The intention of conquest might still be disavowed, as it\r\nhad been five months before; but were the converts to liberty to be denied\r\nthe right of uniting themselves to the French people by their own free\r\nwill? When the armies of the Republic had swept its assailants from the\r\nborder-provinces that gave them entrance into France, were those provinces\r\nto be handed back to a government of priests and nobles? The scruples which\r\nhad condemned all annexation of territory vanished in that orgy of\r\npatriotism which followed the expulsion of the invader and the discovery\r\nthat the Revolution was already a power in other lands than France. The\r\nnation that had to fight the battle of European freedom must appeal to the\r\nspirit of freedom wherever it would answer the call: the conflict with\r\nsovereigns must be maintained by arming their subjects against them in\r\nevery land. In this conception of the universal alliance of the nations,\r\nthe Governments with which France was not yet at war were scarcely\r\ndistinguished from those which had pronounced against her. The\r\nfrontier-lines traced by an obsolete diplomacy, the artificial guarantees\r\nof treaties, were of little account against the living and inalienable\r\nsovereignty of the people. To men inflamed with the passions of 1792 an\r\nargument of international law scarcely conveyed more meaning than to Peter\r\nthe Hermit. Among the statesmen of other lands, who had no intention of\r\nabandoning all the principles recognised as the public right of Europe, the\r\nlanguage now used by France could only be understood as the avowal of\r\nindiscriminate aggression.\r\n\r\n[The neighbors of France.]\r\n\r\nThe Revolution had displayed itself in France as a force of union as well\r\nas of division. It had driven the nobles across the frontier; it had torn\r\nthe clergy from their altars; but it had reconciled sullen Corsica; and by\r\nabolishing feudal rights it had made France the real fatherland of the\r\nTeutonic peasant in Alsace and Lorraine. It was now about to prove its\r\nattractive power in foreign lands. At the close of the last century the\r\nnationalities of Europe were far less consolidated than they are at\r\npresent; only on the Spanish and the Swiss frontier had France a neighbour\r\nthat could be called a nation. On the north, what is now the kingdom of\r\nBelgium was in 1792 a collection of provinces subject to the House of\r\nAustria. The German population both of the districts west of the Rhine and\r\nof those opposite to Alsace was parcelled out among a number of petty\r\nprincipalities. Savoy, though west of the chain of the Alps and French in\r\nspeech, formed part of the kingdom of Piedmont, which was itself severed by\r\nhistory and by national character from the other States of Northern Italy.\r\nAlong the entire frontier, from Dunkirk to the Maritime Alps, France\r\nnowhere touched a strong, united, and independent people; and along this\r\nentire frontier, except in the country opposite Alsace, the armed\r\nproselytism of the French Revolution proved a greater force than the\r\ninfluences on which the existing order of things depended. In the Low\r\nCountries, in the Principalities of the Rhine, in Switzerland, in Savoy, in\r\nPiedmont itself, the doctrines of the Revolution were welcomed by a more or\r\nless numerous class, and the armies of France appeared, though but for a\r\nmoment, as the missionaries of liberty and right rather than as an invading\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n[Custine enters Mainz, Oct. 20.]\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Brunswick been brought to a stand by Dumouriez at Valmy than\r\na French division under Custine crossed the Alsatian frontier and advanced\r\nupon Spires, where Brunswick had left large stores of war. The garrison was\r\ndefeated in an encounter outside the town; Spires and Worms surrendered to\r\nCustine. In the neighbouring fortress of Mainz, the key to Western Germany,\r\nCustine's advance was watched by a republican party among the inhabitants,\r\nfrom whom the French general learnt that he had only to appear before the\r\ncity to become its master. Brunswick had indeed apprehended the failure of\r\nhis invasion of France, but he had never given a thought to the defence of\r\nGermany; and, although the King of Prussia had been warned of the\r\ndefenceless state of Mainz, no steps had been taken beyond the payment of a\r\nsum of money for the repair of the fortifications, which money the\r\nArchbishop expended in the purchase of a wood belonging to himself and the\r\nerection of a timber patchwork. On news arriving of the capture of Spires,\r\nthe Archbishop fled, leaving the administration to the Dean, the\r\nChancellor, and the Commandant. The Chancellor made a speech, calling upon\r\nhis \"beloved brethren\" the citizens to defend themselves to the last\r\nextremity, and daily announced the overthrow of Dumouriez and the\r\napproaching entry of the Allies into Paris, until Custine's soldiers\r\nactually came into sight. [21] Then a council of war declared the city to\r\nbe untenable; and before Custine had brought up a single siege-gun the\r\ngarrison capitulated, and the French were welcomed into Mainz by the\r\npartisans of the Republic (Oct. 20). With the French arms came the French\r\norganisation of liberty. A club was formed on the model of the Jacobin Club\r\nof Paris; existing officers and distinctions of rank were abolished; and\r\nalthough the mass of the inhabitants held aloof, a Republic was finally\r\nproclaimed, and incorporated with the Republic of France.\r\n\r\n[Dumouriez invades the Netherlands.]\r\n\r\n[Battle of Jemappes, Nov. 6.]\r\n\r\nThe success of Custine's raid into Germany did not divert the Convention\r\nfrom the design of attacking Austria in the Netherlands, which Dumouriez\r\nhad from the first pressed upon the Government. It was not three years\r\nsince the Netherlands had been in revolt against the Emperor Joseph. In its\r\norigin the revolt was a reactionary movement of the clerical party against\r\nJoseph's reforms; but there soon sprang up ambitions and hopes at variance\r\nwith the first impulses of the insurrection; and by the side of monks and\r\nmonopolists a national party came into existence, proclaiming the\r\nsovereignty of the people, and imitating all the movements of the French\r\nRevolution. During the brief suspension of Austrian rule the popular and\r\nthe reactionary parties attacked one another; and on the restoration of\r\nLeopold's authority in 1791 the democratic leaders, with a large body of\r\ntheir followers, took refuge beyond the frontier, looking forward to the\r\noutbreak of war between Austria and France. Their partisans formed a French\r\nconnection in the interior of the country; and by some strange illusion,\r\nthe priests themselves and the close corporations which had been attacked\r\nby Joseph supposed that their interests would be respected by Revolutionary\r\nFrance. [22] Thus the ground was everywhere prepared for a French invasion.\r\nDumouriez crossed the frontier. The border fortresses no longer existed;\r\nand after a single battle won by the French at Jemappes on the 6th of\r\nNovember, [23] the Austrians, finding the population universally hostile,\r\nabandoned the Netherlands without a struggle.\r\n\r\n[Nice and Savoy annexed.]\r\n\r\n[Decree of Dec. 15.]\r\n\r\nThe victory of Jemappes, the first pitched battle won by the Republic,\r\nexcited an outburst of revolutionary fervour in the Convention which deeply\r\naffected the relations of France to Great Britain, hitherto a neutral\r\nspectator of the war. A manifesto was published declaring that the French\r\nnation offered its alliance to all peoples who wished to recover their\r\nfreedom, and charging the generals of the Republic to give their protection\r\nto all persons who might suffer in the cause of liberty (Nov. 19). A week\r\nlater Savoy and Nice were annexed to France, the population of Savoy having\r\ndeclared in favour of France and Sardinia. On the 15th of December the\r\nConvention proclaimed that social and political revolution was henceforth\r\nto accompany every movement of its armies on foreign soil. \"In every\r\ncountry that shall be occupied by the armies of the French Republic\"--such\r\nwas the substance of the Decree of December 15th--\"the generals shall\r\nannounce the abolition of all existing authorities; of nobility, of\r\nserfage, of every feudal right and every monopoly; they shall proclaim the\r\nsovereignty of the people, and convoke the inhabitants in assemblies to\r\nform a provisional Government, to which no officer of a former Government,\r\nno noble, nor any member of the former privileged corporations shall be\r\neligible. They shall place under the charge of the French Republic all\r\nproperty belonging to the Sovereign or his adherents, and the property of\r\nevery civil or religious corporation. The French nation will treat as\r\nenemies any people which, refusing liberty and equality, desires to\r\npreserve its prince and privileged castes, or to make any accommodation\r\nwith them.\"\r\n\r\n[England arms.]\r\n\r\n[The Schelde.]\r\n\r\n[Execution of Louis XVI., Jan. 21, 1793.]\r\n\r\nThis singular announcement of a new crusade caused the Government of Great\r\nBritain to arm. Although the decree of the Convention related only to\r\nStates with which France was at war, the Convention had in fact formed\r\nconnections with the English revolutionary societies; and the French\r\nMinister of Marine informed his sailors that they were about to carry fifty\r\nthousand caps of liberty to their English brethren. No prudent statesman\r\nwould treat a mere series of threats against all existing authorities as\r\nground for war; but the acts of the French Government showed that it\r\nintended to carry into effect the violent interference in the affairs of\r\nother nations announced in its manifestoes. Its agents were stirring up\r\ndissatisfaction in every State; and although the annexation of Savoy and\r\nthe occupation of the Netherlands might be treated as incidental to the\r\nconflict with Austria and Sardinia, in which Great Britain had pledged\r\nitself to neutrality, other acts of the Convention were certainly\r\ninfringements of the rights of allies of England. A series of European\r\ntreaties, oppressive according to our own ideas, but in keeping with the\r\nideas of that age, prohibited the navigation of the River Schelde, on which\r\nAntwerp is situated, in order that the commerce of the North Sea might flow\r\nexclusively into Dutch ports. On the conquest of Belgium the French\r\nGovernment gave orders to Dumouriez to send a flotilla down the river, and\r\nto declare Antwerp an open port in right of the law of nature, which\r\ntreaties cannot abrogate. Whatever the folly of commercial restraints, the\r\nnavigation of the Schelde was a question between the Antwerpers and the\r\nDutch, and one in which France had no direct concern. The incident, though\r\ntrivial, was viewed in England as one among many proofs of the intention of\r\nthe French to interfere with the affairs of neighbouring States at their\r\npleasure. In ordinary times it would not have been easy to excite much\r\ninterest in England on behalf of a Dutch monopoly; but the feeling of this\r\ncountry towards the French Revolution had been converted into a passionate\r\nhatred by the massacres of September, and by the open alliance between the\r\nConvention and the Revolutionary societies in England itself. Pitt indeed,\r\nwhom the Parisians imagined to be their most malignant enemy, laboured\r\nagainst the swelling national passion, and hoped against all hope for\r\npeace. Not only was Pitt guiltless of the desire to add this country to the\r\nenemies of France, but he earnestly desired to reconcile France with\r\nAustria, in order that the Western States, whose embroilment left Eastern\r\nEurope at the mercy of Catherine of Russia, might unite to save both Poland\r\nand Turkey from falling into the hands of a Power whose steady aggression\r\nthreatened Europe more seriously than all the noisy and outspoken\r\nexcitement of the French Convention. Pitt, moreover, viewed with deep\r\ndisapproval the secret designs of Austria and Prussia. [24] If the French\r\nexecutive would have given any assurance that the Netherlands should not be\r\nannexed, or if the French ambassador, Chauvelin, who was connected with\r\nEnglish plotters, had been superseded by a trustworthy negotiator, it is\r\nprobable that peace might have been preserved. But when, on the execution\r\nof King Louis (Jan. 21, 1793), Chauvelin was expelled from England as a\r\nsuspected alien, war became a question of days. [25]\r\n\r\n[Holland and Mediterranean States enter the war.]\r\n\r\n[War with England, Feb. 1st, 1793.]\r\n\r\nPoints of technical right figured in the complaints of both sides; but the\r\nreal ground of war was perfectly understood. France considered itself\r\nentitled to advance the Revolution and the Rights of Man wherever its own\r\narms or popular insurrection gave it the command. England denied the right\r\nof any Power to annul the political system of Europe at its pleasure. No\r\nmore serious, no more sufficient, ground of war ever existed between two\r\nnations; yet the event proved that, with the highest justification for war,\r\nthe highest wisdom would yet have chosen peace. England's entry into the\r\nwar converted it from an affair of two or three campaigns into a struggle\r\nof twenty years, resulting in more violent convulsions, more widespread\r\nmisery, and more atrocious crimes, than in all probability would have\r\nresulted even from the temporary triumph of the revolutionary cause in\r\n1793. But in both nations political passion welcomed impending calamity;\r\nand the declaration of war by the Convention on February 1st only\r\nanticipated the desire of the English people. Great Britain once committed\r\nto the struggle, Pitt spared neither money nor intimidation in his efforts\r\nto unite all Europe against France. Holland was included with England in\r\nthe French declaration of war. The Mediterranean States felt that the navy\r\nof England was nearer to them than the armies of Austria and Prussia; and\r\nbefore the end of the summer of 1793, Spain, Portugal, Naples, Tuscany, and\r\nthe Papal States had joined the Coalition.\r\n\r\n[French wrongly think England inclined to revolution.]\r\n\r\nThe Jacobins of Paris had formed a wrong estimate of the political\r\ncondition of England. At the outbreak of the war they believed that England\r\nitself was on the verge of revolution. They mistook the undoubted\r\ndiscontent of a portion of the middle and lower classes, which showed\r\nitself in the cry for parliamentary reform, for a general sentiment of\r\nhatred towards existing institutions, like that which in France had swept\r\naway the old order at a single blow. The Convention received the addresses\r\nof English Radical societies, and imagined that the abuses of the\r\nparliamentary system under George III. had alienated the whole nation. What\r\nthey had found in Belgium and in Savoy--a people thankful to receive the\r\nRights of Man from the soldiers of the Revolution--they expected to find\r\namong the dissenting congregations of London and the factory-hands of\r\nSheffield. The singular attraction exercised by each class in England upon\r\nthe one below it, as well as the indifference of the nation generally to\r\nall ideals, was little understood in France, although the Revolutions of\r\nthe two countries bore this contrast on their face. A month after the fall\r\nof the Bastille, the whole system of class-privilege and monopoly had\r\nvanished from French law; fifteen years of the English Commonwealth had\r\nleft the structure of English society what it had been at the beginning.\r\nBut political observation vanished in the delirium of 1793; and the French\r\nonly discovered, when it was too late, that in Great Britain the Revolution\r\nhad fallen upon an enemy of unparalleled stubbornness and inexhaustible\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n[The Whigs not democratic.]\r\n\r\n[Political condition of England.]\r\n\r\nIn the first Assembly of the Revolution it was usual to speak of the\r\nEnglish as free men whom the French ought to imitate; in the Convention it\r\nwas usual to speak of them as slaves whom the French ought to deliver. The\r\ninstitutions of England bore in fact a very different aspect when compared\r\nwith the absolute monarchy of the Bourbons and when compared with the\r\ndemocracy of 1793. Frenchmen who had lived under the government of a Court\r\nwhich made laws by edict and possessed the right to imprison by\r\nletters-patent looked with respect upon the Parliament of England, its\r\ntrial by jury, and its freedom of the press. The men who had sent a king to\r\nprison and confiscated the estates of a great part of the aristocracy could\r\nonly feel compassion for a land where three-fourths of the national\r\nrepresentatives were nominees of the Crown or of wealthy peers. Nor, in\r\nspite of the personal sympathy of Fox with the French revolutionary\r\nmovement, was there any real affinity between the English Whig party and\r\nthat which now ruled in the Convention. The event which fixed the character\r\nof English liberty during the eighteenth century, the Revolution of 1688,\r\nhad nothing democratic in its nature. That revolution was directed against\r\na system of Roman Catholic despotism; it gave political power not to the\r\nmass of the nation, which had no desire and no capacity to exercise it, but\r\nto a group of noble families and their retainers, who, during the reigns of\r\nthe first two Georges, added all the patronage and influence of the Crown\r\nto their social and constitutional weight in the country. The domestic\r\nhistory of England since the accession of George III. had turned chiefly\r\nupon the obstinate struggle of this monarch to deliver himself from all\r\ndependence upon party. The divisions of the Whigs, their jealousies, but,\r\nabove all, their real alienation from the mass of the people whose rights\r\nthey professed to defend, ultimately gave the King the victory, when, after\r\ntwenty years of errors, be found in the younger Pitt a Minister capable of\r\nuniting the interests of the Crown with the ablest and most patriotic\r\nliberal statesmanship. Bribes, threats, and every species of base influence\r\nhad been employed by King George to break up the great Coalition of 1783,\r\nwhich united all sections of the Whigs against him under the Ministry of\r\nFox and North; but the real support of Pitt, whom the King placed in office\r\nwith a minority in the House of Commons, was the temper of the nation\r\nitself, wearied with the exclusiveness, the corruption, and the\r\nparty-spirit of the Whigs, and willing to believe that a popular Minister,\r\neven if he had entered upon power unconstitutionally, might do more for the\r\ncountry than the constitutional proprietors of the rotten boroughs.\r\n\r\n[Pitt Minister, 1783.]\r\n\r\n[Effect of French Revolution on English Parties.]\r\n\r\nFrom 1783 down to the outbreak of the French Revolution, Pitt, as a Tory\r\nMinister confronted by a Whig Opposition, governed England on more liberal\r\nprinciples than any statesman who had held power during the eighteenth\r\ncentury. These years were the last of the party-system of England in its\r\noriginal form. The French Revolution made an end of that old distinction in\r\nwhich the Tory was known as the upholder of Crown-prerogative and the Whig\r\nas the supporter of a constitutional oligarchy of great families. It\r\ncreated that new political antagonism in which, whether under the names of\r\nWhig and Tory, or of Liberal and Conservative, two great parties have\r\ncontended, one for a series of beneficial changes, the other for the\r\npreservation of the existing order. The convulsions of France and the dread\r\nof revolutionary agitation in England transformed both Pitt and the Whigs\r\nby whom he was opposed. Pitt sacrificed his schemes of peaceful progress to\r\nforeign war and domestic repression, and set his face against the reform of\r\nParliament which he had once himself proposed. The Whigs broke up into two\r\nsections, led respectively by Burke and by Fox, the one denouncing the\r\nviolence of the Revolution, and ultimately uniting itself with Pitt; the\r\nother friendly to the Revolution, in spite of its excesses, as the cause of\r\ncivil and religious liberty, and identifying itself, under the healthy\r\ninfluence of parliamentary defeat and disappointment, with the defence of\r\npopular rights in England and the advocacy of enlightened reform.\r\n\r\n[Burke's \"Reflections,\" Oct. 1790.]\r\n\r\n[Most of the Whigs support Pitt against France.]\r\n\r\nThe obliteration of the old dividing-line in English politics may be said\r\nto date from the day when the ancient friendship of Burke and Fox was\r\nbitterly severed by the former in the House of Commons (May 6, 1791). The\r\ncharter of the modern Conservative party was that appeal to the nation\r\nwhich Burke had already published, in the autumn of 1790, under the title\r\nof \"Reflections on the French Revolution.\" In this survey of the political\r\nforces which he saw in action around him, the great Whig writer, who in\r\npast times had so passionately defended the liberties of America and the\r\nconstitutional tradition of the English Parliament against the aggression\r\nof George III., attacked the Revolution as a system of violence and caprice\r\nmore formidable to freedom than the tyranny of any Crown. He proved that\r\nthe politicians and societies of England who had given it their sympathy\r\nhad given their sympathy to measures and to theories opposed to every\r\nprinciple of 1688. Above all, he laid bare that agency of riot and\r\ndestructiveness which, even within the first few months of the Revolution,\r\nfilled him with presentiment of the calamities about to fall upon France.\r\nBurke's treatise was no dispassionate inquiry into the condition of a\r\nneighbouring state: it was a denunciation of Jacobinism as fierce and as\r\nlittle qualified by political charity as were the maledictions of the\r\nHebrew prophets upon their idolatrous neighbours; and it was intended, like\r\nthese, to excite his own countrymen against innovations among themselves.\r\nIt completely succeeded. It expressed, and it heightened, the alarm arising\r\namong the Liberal section of the propertied class, at first well inclined\r\nto the Revolution; and, although the Whigs of the House of Commons\r\npronounced in favour of Fox upon his first rupture with Burke, the tide of\r\npublic feeling, rising higher with every new outrage of the Revolution,\r\nsoon invaded the legislature, and carried the bulk of the Whig party to the\r\nside of the Minister, leaving to Fox and his few faithful adherents the\r\ntask of maintaining an unheeded protest against the blind passions of war,\r\nand the increasing rigour with which Pitt repressed every symptom of\r\npopular disaffection.\r\n\r\n[The Gironde and the Mountain in the Convention.]\r\n\r\n[The Gironde and the Commune of Paris.]\r\n\r\nThe character of violence which Burke traced and condemned in the earliest\r\nacts of the Revolution displayed itself in a much stronger light after the\r\noverthrow of the Monarchy by the insurrection of August 10th. That event\r\nwas the work of men who commanded the Parisian democracy, not the work of\r\norators and party-leaders in the Assembly. The Girondins had not hesitated\r\nto treat the victory as their own, by placing the great offices of State,\r\nwith one exception, in the hands of their leaders; they instantly found\r\nthat the real sovereignty lay elsewhere. The Council of the Commune, or\r\nMunicipality, of Paris, whose members had seized their post at the moment\r\nof the insurrection, was the only administrative body that possessed the\r\npower to enforce its commands; in the Ministries of State one will alone\r\nmade itself felt, that of Danton, whom the Girondins had unwillingly\r\nadmitted to office along with themselves. The massacres of September threw\r\ninto full light the powerlessness of the expiring Assembly. For five\r\nsuccessive days it was unable to check the massacres; it was unable to\r\nbring to justice the men who had planned them, and who called upon the rest\r\nof France to follow their example. With the meeting of the Convention,\r\nhowever, the Girondins, who now regarded themselves as the legitimate\r\ngovernment, and forgot that they owed office to an insurrection, expected\r\nto reduce the capital to submission. They commanded an overwhelming\r\nmajority in the new chamber; they were supported by the middle class in all\r\nthe great cities of France. The party of the Mountain embraced at first\r\nonly the deputies of Paris, and a group of determined men who admitted no\r\ncriticism on the measures which the democracy of Paris had thought\r\nnecessary for the Revolution. In the Convention they were the assailed, not\r\nthe assailants. Without waiting to secure themselves by an armed force, the\r\norators of the Gironde attempted to crush both the Municipality and the\r\ndeputies who ruled at the Clubs. They reproached the Municipality with the\r\nmurders of September; they accused Robespierre of aiming at the\r\nDictatorship. It was under the pressure of these attacks that the party of\r\nthe Mountain gathered its strength within the Convention, and that the\r\npopulace of Paris transferred to the Gironde the passionate hatred which it\r\nhad hitherto borne to the King and the aristocracy. The gulf that lay\r\nbetween the people and those who had imagined themselves to be its leaders\r\nburst into view. The Girondins saw with dismay that the thousands of hungry\r\nworkmen whose victory had placed them in power had fought for something\r\nmore tangible than Republican phrases from Tacitus and Plutarch. On one\r\nside was a handful of orators and writers, steeped in the rhetoric and the\r\ncommonplace of ancient Rome, and totally strange to the real duties of\r\ngovernment; on the other side the populace of Paris, such as centuries of\r\ndespotism, privilege, and priestcraft had made it: sanguinary, unjust,\r\nvindictive; convulsed since the outbreak of the Revolution with every\r\npassion that sways men in the mass; taught no conception of progress but\r\nthe overthrow of authority, and acquainted with no title to power but that\r\nwhich was bestowed by itself. If the Girondins were to remain in power,\r\nthey could do so only by drawing an army from the departments, or by\r\nidentifying themselves with the multitude. They declined to take either\r\ncourse. Their audience was in the Assembly alone; their support in the\r\ndistant provinces. Paris, daily more violent, listened to men of another\r\nstamp. The Municipality defied the Government; the Mountain answered the\r\nthreats and invectives of the majority in the Assembly by displays of\r\npopular menace and tumult. In the eyes of the common people, who after so\r\nmany changes of government found themselves more famished and more\r\ndestitute than ever, the Gironde was now but the last of a succession of\r\ntyrannies; its statesmen but impostors who stood between the people and the\r\nenjoyment of their liberty.\r\n\r\nAmong the leaders of the Mountain, Danton aimed at the creation of a\r\ncentral Revolutionary Government, armed with absolute powers for the\r\nprosecution of the war; and he attacked the Girondins only when they\r\nthemselves had rejected his support. Robespierre, himself the author of\r\nlittle beyond destruction, was the idol of those whom Rousseau's writings\r\nhad filled with the idea of a direct exercise of sovereignty by the people.\r\nIt was in the trial of the King that the Gironde first confessed its\r\nsubmission to the democracy of Paris. The Girondins in their hearts desired\r\nto save the King; they voted for his death with the hope of maintaining\r\ntheir influence in Paris, and of clearing themselves from the charge of\r\nlukewarmness in the cause of the Revolution. But the sacrifice was as vain\r\nas it was dishonourable. The populace and the party of the Mountain took\r\nthe act in its true character, as an acknowledgment of their own victory. A\r\nseries of measures was brought forward providing for the poorer classes at\r\nthe expense of the wealthy. The Gironde, now forced to become the defenders\r\nof property, encountered the fatal charge of deserting the cause of the\r\npeople; and from this time nothing but successful foreign warfare could\r\nhave saved their party from ruin.\r\n\r\n[Defeat and treason of Dumouriez, March, 1793.]\r\n\r\nInstead of success came inaction, disaster, and treason. The army of\r\nFlanders lay idle during January and February for want of provisions and\r\nmaterials of war; and no sooner had Dumouriez opened the campaign against\r\nHolland than he was recalled by intelligence that the Austrians had fallen\r\nupon his lieutenant, Miranda, at Maestricht, and driven the French army\r\nbefore them. Dumouriez returned, in order to fight a pitched battle before\r\nBrussels. He attacked the Austrians at Neerwinden (March 18), and suffered\r\na repulse inconsiderable in itself, but sufficient to demoralise an army\r\ncomposed in great part of recruits and National Guards. [26] His defeat\r\nlaid Flanders open to the Austrians; but Dumouriez intended that it should\r\ninflict upon the Republic a far heavier blow. Since the execution of the\r\nKing, he had been at open enmity with the Jacobins. He now proposed to the\r\nAustrian commander to unite with him in an attack upon the Convention, and\r\nin re-establishing monarchy in France. The first pledge of Dumouriez's\r\ntreason was the surrender of three commissioners sent by the Convention to\r\nhis camp; the second was to have been the surrender of the fortress of\r\nCondé. But Dumouriez had overrated his influence with the army. Plainer\r\nminds than his own knew how to deal with a general who intrigues with the\r\nforeigner. Dumouriez's orders were disregarded; his movements watched; and\r\nhe fled to the Austrian lines under the fire of his own soldiers. About\r\nthirty officers and eight hundred men passed with him to the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Defeats on the North and East. Revolt of La Vendée, March, 1793.]\r\n\r\n[The Commune crushes the Gironde, June 2.]\r\n\r\nThe defeat and treason of Dumouriez brought the army of Austria over the\r\nnorthern frontier. Almost at the same moment Custine was overpowered in the\r\nPalatinate; and the conquests of the previous autumn, with the exception of\r\nMainz, were lost as rapidly as they had been won. Custine fell back upon\r\nthe lines of Weissenburg, leaving the defence of Mainz to a garrison of\r\n17,000 men, which, alone among the Republican armies, now maintained its\r\nreputation. In France itself civil war broke out. The peasants of La\r\nVendée, a district destitute of large towns, and scarcely touched either by\r\nthe evils which had produced the Revolution or by the hopes which animated\r\nthe rest of France, had seen with anger the expulsion of the parish priests\r\nwho refused to take the oath to the Constitution. A levy of 300,000 men,\r\nwhich was ordered by the Convention in February, 1793, threw into revolt\r\nthe simple Vendeans, who cared for nothing outside their own parishes, and\r\npreferred to fight against their countrymen rather than to quit their\r\nhomes. The priests and the Royalists fanned these village outbreaks into a\r\nreligious war of the most serious character. Though poorly armed, and\r\naccustomed to return to their homes as soon as fighting was over, the\r\nVendean peasantry proved themselves a formidable soldiery in the moment of\r\nattack, and cut to pieces the half-disciplined battalions which the\r\nGovernment sent against them. On the north, France was now assailed by the\r\nEnglish as well as by the Austrians. The Allies laid siege to Condé and\r\nValenciennes, and drove the French army back in disorder at Famars. Each\r\ndefeat was a blow dealt to the Government of the Gironde at Paris. With\r\nforeign and civil war adding disaster to disaster, with the general to whom\r\nthe Gironde had entrusted the defence of the Republic openly betraying it\r\nto its enemies, the fury of the capital was easily excited against the\r\nparty charged with all the misfortunes of France. A threatening movement of\r\nthe middle classes in resistance to a forced loan precipitated the\r\nstruggle. The Girondins were accused of arresting the armies of the\r\nRepublic in the midst of their conquests, of throwing the frontier open to\r\nthe foreigner, and of kindling the civil war of La Vendée. On the 31st of\r\nMay a raging mob invaded the Convention. Two days later the representatives\r\nof France were surrounded by the armed forces of the Commune; the\r\ntwenty-four leading members of the Gironde were placed under arrest, and\r\nthe victory of the Mountain was completed. [27]\r\n\r\n[Civil War. The Committee of Public Safety.]\r\n\r\nThe situation of France, which was serious before, now became desperate;\r\nfor the Girondins, escaping from their arrest, called the departments to\r\narms against Paris. Normandy, Bordeaux, Marseilles, Lyons, rose in\r\ninsurrection against the tyranny of the Mountain, and the Royalists of the\r\nsouth and west threw themselves into a civil war which they hoped to turn\r\nto their own advantage. But a form of government had now arisen in France\r\nwell fitted to cope with extraordinary perils. It was a form of government\r\nin which there was little trace of the constitutional tendencies of 1789,\r\none that had come into being as the stress of conflict threw into the\r\nbackground the earlier hopes and efforts of the Revolution. In the two\r\nearlier Assemblies it had been a fixed principle that the representatives\r\nof the people were to control the Government, but were not to assume\r\nexecutive powers themselves. After the overthrow of Monarchy on the 10th\r\nAugust, the Ministers, though still nominally possessed of powers distinct\r\nfrom the representative body, began to be checked by Committees of the\r\nConvention appointed for various branches of the public service; and in\r\nMarch, 1793, in order to meet the increasing difficulties of the war, a\r\nCommittee of Public Safety was appointed, charged with the duty of\r\nexercising a general surveillance over the administration. In this\r\nCommittee, however, as in all the others, the Gironde were in the majority;\r\nand the twenty-four members who composed it were too numerous a body to act\r\nwith effect. The growing ascendancy of the Mountain produced that\r\nconcentration of force which the times required. The Committee was reduced\r\nin April to nine members, and in this form it ultimately became the supreme\r\ncentral power. It was not until after the revolt of Lyons that the\r\nCommittee, exchanging Danton's influence for that of Robespierre, adopted\r\nthe principle of Terror which has made the memory of their rule one of the\r\nmost sinister in history. Their authority steadily increased. The members\r\ndivided among themselves the great branches of government. One directed the\r\narmy, another the navy, another foreign affairs; the signature of three\r\nmembers practically gave to any measure the force of law, for the\r\nConvention accepted and voted their reports as a matter of course.\r\n\r\n[Commissioners of the Convention]\r\n\r\nWhilst the Committee gave orders as the supreme executive, eighty of the\r\nmost energetic of the Mountain spread themselves over France, in parties of\r\ntwo and three, with the title of Commissioners of the Convention, and with\r\npowers over-riding those of all the local authorities. They were originally\r\nappointed for the purpose of hastening on the levy ordered by the\r\nConvention in March, but their powers were gradually extended over the\r\nwhole range of administration. Their will was absolute, their authority\r\nsupreme. Where the councillors of the Departments or the municipal officers\r\nwere good Jacobins, the Commissioners availed themselves of local\r\nmachinery; where they suspected their principles, they sent them to the\r\nscaffold, and enforced their own orders by whatever means were readiest.\r\nThey censured and dismissed the generals; one of them even directed the\r\nmovements of a fleet at sea. What was lost by waste and confusion and by\r\nthe interference of the Commissioners in military movements was more than\r\ncounterbalanced by the vigour which they threw into all the preparations of\r\nwar, and by the unity of purpose which, at the price of unsparing\r\nbloodshed, they communicated to every group where Frenchmen met together.\r\n\r\n[Local revolutionary system of 1793]\r\n\r\nBut no individual energy could have sustained these dictatorships without\r\nthe support of a popular organisation. All over France a system of\r\nrevolutionary government sprang up, which superseded all existing\r\ninstitutions just as the authority of the Commissioners of the Convention\r\nsuperseded all existing local powers. The local revolutionary\r\nadministration consisted of a Committee, a Club, and a Tribunal. [28] In\r\neach of 21,000 communes a committee of twelve was elected by the people,\r\nand entrusted by the Convention, as the Terror gained ground, with\r\nboundless powers of arrest and imprisonment. Popular excitement was\r\nsustained by clubs, where the peasants and labourers assembled at the close\r\nof their day's work, and applauded the victories or denounced the enemies\r\nof the Revolution. A Tribunal with swift procedure and powers of life and\r\ndeath sat in each of the largest towns, and judged the prisoners who were\r\nsent to it by the committees of the neighbouring district. Such was the\r\ngovernment of 1793--an executive of uncontrolled power drawn from the\r\nmembers of a single Assembly, and itself brought into immediate contact\r\nwith the poorest of the people in their assemblies and clubs. The balance\r\nof interests which creates a constitutional system, the security of life,\r\nliberty, and property, which is the essence of every recognised social\r\norder, did not now exist in France. One public purpose, the defence of the\r\nRevolution, became the law before which all others lost their force.\r\nTreating all France like a town in a state of siege, the Government took\r\nupon itself the duty of providing support for the poorest classes by\r\nenactments controlling the sale and possession of the necessaries of life.\r\n\r\n[Law of the Maximum]\r\n\r\nThe price of corn and other necessaries was fixed; and, when the traders\r\nand producers consequently ceased to bring their goods to market, the\r\nCommissioners of the Convention were empowered to make requisition of a\r\ncertain quantity of corn for every acre of ground. Property was thus placed\r\nat the disposal of the men who already exercised absolute political power.\r\n\"The state of France,\" said Burke, \"is perfectly simple. It consists of but\r\ntwo descriptions, the oppressors and the oppressed.\" It is in vain that the\r\nattempt has been made to extenuate the atrocious and senseless cruelties of\r\nthis time by extolling the great legislative projects of the Convention, or\r\npleading the dire necessity of a land attacked on every side by the\r\nforeigner, and rent with civil war. The more that is known of the Reign of\r\nTerror, the more hateful, the meaner and more disgusting is the picture\r\nunveiled. France was saved not by the brutalities, but by the energy, of\r\nthe faction that ruled it. It is scarcely too much to say that the cause of\r\nEuropean progress would have been less injured by the military overthrow of\r\nthe Republic, by the severance of the border provinces from France and the\r\nrestoration of some shadow of the ancient _régime_, than by the traditions\r\nof horror which for the next fifty years were inseparably associated in\r\nmen's minds with the victory of the people over established power.\r\n\r\n[French disasters, March-Sept., 1793.]\r\n\r\nThe Revolutionary organisation did not reach its full vigour till the\r\nautumn of 1793, when the prospects of France were at their worst. Custine,\r\nwho was brought up from Alsace to take command of the Army of the North,\r\nfound it so demoralised that he was unable to attempt the relief of the\r\nfortresses which were now besieged by the Allies. Condé surrendered to the\r\nAustrians on the 10th of July; Valenciennes capitulated to the Duke of York\r\na fortnight later. In the east the fortune of war was no better. An attack\r\nmade on the Prussian army besieging Mainz totally failed; and on the 23rd\r\nof July this great fortress, which had been besieged since the middle of\r\nApril, passed back into the hands of the Germans. On every side the\r\nRepublic seemed to be sinking before its enemies. Its frontier defences had\r\nfallen before the victorious Austrians and English; Brunswick was ready to\r\nadvance upon Alsace from conquered Mainz; Lyons and Toulon were in revolt;\r\nLa Vendée had proved the grave of the forces sent to subdue it. It was in\r\nthis crisis of misfortune that the Convention placed the entire male\r\npopulation of France between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five at the\r\ndisposal of the Government, and turned the whole country into one great\r\ncamp and arsenal of war. Nor was there wanting a mind equal to the task of\r\ngiving order to this vast material. The appointment of Carnot, an officer\r\nof engineers, to a seat on the Committee of Public Safety placed the\r\nmilitary administration of France in the hands of a man who, as an\r\norganiser, if not as a strategist, was soon to prove himself without equal\r\nin Europe.\r\n\r\n[The Allies seek each their separate ends.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it was to the dissensions and to the bad policy of the Allies\r\nmore than to the energy of its own Government that France owed its safety.\r\nThe object for which the Allies professed to be carrying on the war, the\r\nestablishment of a pacific Government in France, was subordinated to\r\nschemes of aggrandisement, known as the acquisition of just indemnities.\r\nWhile Prussia, bent chiefly on preventing the Emperor from gaining Bavaria\r\nin exchange for Belgium, kept its own army inactive on the Rhine, [29]\r\nAustria, with the full approval of Pitt's Cabinet, claimed annexations in\r\nNorthern France, as well as Alsace, and treated the conquered town of Condé\r\nas Austrian territory. [30] Henceforward all the operations of the northern\r\narmy were directed to the acquisition of frontier territory, not to the\r\npursuit and overthrow of the Republican forces. The war was openly\r\nconverted from a war of defence into a war of spoliation. It was a change\r\nwhich mocked the disinterested professions with which the Allies had taken\r\nup arms; in its military results it was absolutely ruinous. In face of the\r\nimmense levies which promised the French certain victory in a long war, the\r\nonly hope for the Allies lay in a rapid march to Paris; they preferred the\r\nextreme of division and delay. No sooner had the advance of their united\r\narmies driven Custine from his stronghold at Famars, than the English\r\ncommander led off his forces to besiege Dunkirk, while the Austrians, under\r\nPrince Coburg, proceeded to invest Cambray and Le Quesnoy. The line of the\r\ninvaders thus extended from the Channel to Brunswick's posts at Landau, on\r\nthe border of Alsace; the main armies were out of reach of one another, and\r\ntheir strength was diminished by the corps detached to keep up their\r\ncommunications. The French held the inner circle; and the advantage which\r\nthis gave them was well understood by Carnot, who now inspired the measures\r\nof the Committee. In steadiness and precision the French recruits were no\r\nmatch for the trained armies of Germany; but the supply of them was\r\ninexhaustible, and Carnot knew that when they were thrown in sufficient\r\nmasses upon the enemy their courage and enthusiasm would make amends for\r\ntheir inexperience. The successes of the Allies, unbroken from February to\r\nAugust, now began to alternate with defeats; the flood of invasion was\r\nfirst slowly and obstinately repelled, then swept away before a victorious\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\n[York driven from Dunkirk Sept. 8.]\r\n\r\nIt was on the British commander that the first blow was struck. The forces\r\nthat could be detached from the French Northern army were not sufficient to\r\ndrive York from before Dunkirk; but on the Moselle there were troops\r\nengaged in watching an enemy who was not likely to advance; and the\r\nCommittee did not hesitate to leave this side of France open to the\r\nPrussians in order to deal a decisive stroke in the north. Before the\r\nmovement was noticed by the enemy, Carnot had transported 30,000 men from\r\nMetz to the English Channel; and in the first week of September the German\r\ncorps covering York was assailed by General Houchard with numbers double\r\nits own. The Germans were driven back upon Dunkirk; York only saved his own\r\narmy from destruction by hastily raising the siege and abandoning his heavy\r\nartillery. The victory of the French, however, was ill followed up.\r\nHouchard was sent before the Revolutionary Tribunal, and he paid with his\r\nlife for his mistakes. Custine had already perished, unjustly condemned for\r\nthe loss of Mainz and Valenciennes.\r\n\r\n[Commands given to men of the people.]\r\n\r\n[Jourdan's victory at Wattignies, Oct 15.]\r\n\r\nIt was no unimportant change for France when the successors of Custine and\r\nHouchard received their commands from the Committee of Public Safety. The\r\nlevelling principle of the Reign of Terror left its effect on France\r\nthrough its operation in the army, and through this almost alone. Its\r\nexecutions produced only horror and reaction; its confiscations were soon\r\nreversed; but the creation of a thoroughly democratic army, the work of the\r\nmen who overthrew the Gironde, gave the most powerful and abiding impulse\r\nto social equality in France. The first generals of the Revolution had been\r\nofficers of the old army, men, with a few exceptions, of noble birth, who,\r\nlike Custine, had enrolled themselves on the popular side when most of\r\ntheir companions quitted the country. These generals were connected with\r\nthe politicians of the Gironde, and were involved in its fall. The victory\r\nof the Mountain brought men of another type into command. Almost all the\r\nleaders appointed by the Committee of Public Safety were soldiers who had\r\nserved in the ranks. In the levies of 1792 and 1793 the officers of the\r\nnewly-formed battalions were chosen by the recruits themselves. Patriotism,\r\nenergy of character, acquaintance with warfare, instantly brought men into\r\nprominence. Soldiers of the old army, like Massena, who had reached middle\r\nlife with their knapsacks on their backs; lawyers, like the Breton Moreau;\r\nwaiters at inns, like Murat, found themselves at the head of their\r\nbattalions, and knew that Carnot was ever watching for genius and ability\r\nto call it to the highest commands. With a million of men under arms, there\r\nwere many in whom great natural gifts supplied the want of professional\r\ntraining. It was also inevitable that at the outset command should\r\nsometimes fall into the hands of mere busy politicians; but the character\r\nof the generals steadily rose as the Committee gained the ascendancy over a\r\nknot of demagogues who held the War Ministry during the summer of 1793; and\r\nby the end of the year there was scarcely one officer in high command who\r\nhad not proved himself worthy of his post. In the investigation into\r\nHouchard's conduct at Dunkirk, Carnot learnt that the victory had in fact\r\nbeen won by Jourdan, one of the generals of division. Jourdan had begun\r\nlife as a common soldier fifteen years before. Discharged at the end of the\r\nAmerican War, he had set up a draper's shop in Limoges, his native town. He\r\njoined the army a second time on the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, and\r\nthe men of his battalion elected him captain. His ability was noticed; he\r\nwas made successively general of brigade and general of division; and, upon\r\nthe dismissal of Houchard, Carnot summoned him to the command of the Army\r\nof the North. The Austrians were now engaged in the investment of Maubeuge.\r\nOn the 15th of October Jourdan attacked and defeated their covering army at\r\nWattignies. His victory forced the Austrians to raise the siege, and\r\nbrought the campaign to an end for the winter.\r\n\r\n[Lyons, Toulon, La Vendée, conquered, Oct.-Dec. 1793.]\r\n\r\nThus successful on the northern frontier, the Republic carried on war\r\nagainst its internal enemies without pause and without mercy. Lyons\r\nsurrendered in October; its citizens were slaughtered by hundreds in cold\r\nblood. Toulon had thrown itself into the hands of the English, and\r\nproclaimed King Louis XVII. It was besieged by land; but the operations\r\nproduced no effect until Napoleon Bonaparte, captain of artillery, planned\r\nthe capture of a ridge from which the cannon of the besiegers would command\r\nthe English fleet in the harbour. Hood, the British admiral, now found his\r\nposition hopeless. He took several thousands of the inhabitants on board\r\nhis ships, and put out to sea, blowing up the French ships which he left in\r\nthe harbour. Hood had received the fleet from the Royalists in trust for\r\ntheir King; its destruction gave England command of the Mediterranean and\r\nfreed Naples from fear of attack; and Hood thought too little of the\r\nconsequences which his act would bring down upon those of the inhabitants\r\nof Toulon whom he left behind. [31]\r\n\r\nThe horrors that followed the entry of the Republican army into the city\r\ndid not prevent Pitt from including among the subjects of congratulation in\r\nthe King's Speech of 1794 \"the circumstances attending the evacuation of\r\nToulon.\" It was perhaps fortunate for the Royalists in other parts of\r\nFrance that they failed to receive the assistance of England. Help was\r\npromised to the Vendeans, but it arrived too late. The appearance of Kleber\r\nat the head of the army which had defended Mainz had already turned the\r\nscale. Brave as they were, the Vendeans could not long resist trained\r\narmies. The war of pitched battles ended on the Loire with the year 1793.\r\nIt was succeeded by a war of merciless and systematic destruction on the\r\none side, and of ambush and surprises on the other.\r\n\r\n[Prussia withdrawing from the war on account of Polish affairs.]\r\n\r\nAt home the foes of the Republic were sinking; its invaders were too much\r\nat discord with one another to threaten it any longer with serious danger.\r\nPrussia was in fact withdrawing from the war. It has been seen that when\r\nKing Frederick William and the Emperor concerted the autumn campaign of\r\n1792, the understanding was formed that Prussia, in return for its efforts\r\nagainst France, should be allowed to seize part of western Poland, if the\r\nEmpress Catherine should give her consent. With this prospect before it,\r\nthe thoughts of the Prussian Government had been from the first busied more\r\nwith Poland, where it hoped to enter into possession, than with France,\r\nwhere it had only to fight Austria's battles. Negotiations on the Polish\r\nquestion had been actively carried on between Berlin and St. Petersburg\r\nduring the first months of the war; and in January, 1793, the Empress\r\nCatherine had concluded a Treaty of Partition with King Frederick William,\r\nin virtue of which a Prussian army under General Möllendorf immediately\r\nentered western Poland. It was thought good policy to keep the terms of\r\nthis treaty secret from Austria, as it granted a much larger portion of\r\nPoland to Prussia than Austria was willing that it should receive. Two\r\nmonths passed before the Austrian Sovereign learnt how he had been treated\r\nby his ally. He then denounced the treaty, and assumed so threatening an\r\nattitude that the Prussians thought it necessary to fortify the territory\r\nthat they had seized. [32] The Ministers who had been outwitted by the\r\nCourt of Berlin were dismissed; Baron Thugut, who from the first had\r\nprophesied nothing but evil of the Prussian alliance, was called to power.\r\nThe history of this statesman, who for the next eight years directed the\r\nwar-policy of Austria, and filled a part in Europe subordinate only to\r\nthose of Pitt and Bonaparte, has until a recent date been drawn chiefly\r\nfrom the representations of his enemies. Humbly born, scornful and\r\ninaccessible, Thugut was detested by the Viennese aristocracy; the French\r\nemigrants hated and maligned him on account of his indifference to their\r\ncause; the public opinion of Austria held him responsible for unparalleled\r\nmilitary disasters; Prussian generals and ambassadors, whose reports have\r\nformed the basis of Prussian histories, pictured him as a Satanic\r\nantagonist. It was long believed of Thugut that while ambassador at\r\nConstantinople he had sold the Austrian cypher to the French; that in 1794\r\nhe prevented his master's armies from winning victories because he had\r\nspeculated in the French funds; and that in 1799 he occasioned the murder\r\nof the French envoys at Rastadt, in order to recover documents\r\nincriminating himself. Better sources of information are now opened, and a\r\nstatesman, jealous, bitter, and over-reaching, but not without great\r\nqualities of character, stands in the place of the legendary criminal. It\r\nis indeed clear that Thugut's hatred of Prussia amounted almost to mania;\r\nit is also clear that his designs of aggression, formed in the school of\r\nthe Emperor Joseph, were fatally in conflict with the defensive principles\r\nwhich Europe ought to have opposed to the aggressions of France. Evidence\r\nexists that during the eight years of Thugut's ministry he entertained,\r\ntogether or successively, projects for the annexation of French Flanders,\r\nBavaria, Alsace, part of Poland, Venice and Dalmatia, Salzburg, the Papal\r\nLegations, the Republic of Genoa, Piedmont, and Bosnia; and to this list\r\nTuscany and Savoy ought probably to be added. But the charges brought\r\nagainst Thugut of underhand dealings with France, and of the willing\r\nabandonment of German interests in return for compensation to Austria in\r\nItaly, rest on insufficient ground. Though, like every other politician at\r\nVienna and Berlin, he viewed German affairs not as a matter of nationality\r\nbut in subordination to the general interests of his own Court, Thugut\r\nappears to have been, of all the Continental statesmen of that time, the\r\nsteadiest enemy of French aggression, and to have offered the longest\r\nresistance to a peace that was purchased by the cession of German soil.\r\n[33]\r\n\r\n[Victories of Hoche and Pichegru at Wörth and Weissenburg, Dec. 23, 26.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, from the moment when Thugut was called to power the alliance\r\nbetween Austria and Prussia was doomed. Others might perhaps have averted a\r\nrupture; Thugut made no attempt to do so. The siege of Mainz was the last\r\nserious operation of war which the Prussian army performed. The mission of\r\nan Austrian envoy, Lehrbach, to the Prussian camp in August, 1793, and his\r\nnegotiations on the Polish and the Bavarian questions, only widened the\r\nbreach between the two Courts. It was known that the Austrians were\r\nencouraging the Polish Diet to refuse the cession of the provinces occupied\r\nby Prussia; and the advisers of King Frederick William in consequence\r\nrecommended him to quit the Rhine, and to place himself at the head of an\r\narmy in Poland. At the headquarters of the Allies, between Mainz and the\r\nAlsatian frontier, all was dissension and intrigue. The impetuosity of the\r\nAustrian general, Wurmser, who advanced upon Alsace without consulting the\r\nKing, was construed as a studied insult. On the 29th of September, after\r\ninforming the allied Courts that Prussia would henceforth take only a\r\nsubordinate part in the war, King Frederick William quitted the army,\r\nleaving orders with the Duke of Brunswick to fight no great battle. It was\r\nin vain that Wurmser stormed the lines of Weissenburg (Oct. 13), and\r\nvictoriously pushed forward into Alsace. The hopes of a Royalist\r\ninsurrection in Strasburg proved illusory. The German sympathies shown by a\r\nportion of the upper and middle classes of Alsace only brought down upon\r\nthem a bloody vengeance at the hands of St. Just, commissioner of the\r\nConvention. The peasantry, partly from hatred of the feudal burdens of the\r\nold _régime_, partly from fear of St. Just and the guillotine, thronged to\r\nthe French camp. In place of the beaten generals came Hoche and Pichegru:\r\nHoche, lately a common soldier in the Guards, earning by a humble industry\r\nlittle sums for the purchase of books, now, at the age of twenty-six, a\r\ncommander more than a match for the wrangling veterans of Germany;\r\nPichegru, six years older, also a man sprung from the people, once a\r\nteacher in the military school of Brienne, afterwards a private of\r\nartillery in the American War. A series of harassing encounters took place\r\nduring December. At length, with St. Just cheering on the Alsatian peasants\r\nin the hottest of the fire, these generals victoriously carried the\r\nAustrian positions at Wörth and at Weissenburg (Dec. 23, 26). The Austrian\r\ncommander declared his army to be utterly ruined; and Brunswick, who had\r\nabstained from rendering his ally any real assistance, found himself a\r\nsecond time back upon the Rhine. [34]\r\n\r\n[Pitt's bargain with Prussia, April, 1794.]\r\n\r\n[Revolt of Kosciusko. April, 1794.]\r\n\r\n[Möllendorf refuses to help in Flanders.]\r\n\r\nThe virtual retirement of Prussia from the Coalition was no secret to the\r\nFrench Government: amongst the Allies it was viewed in various lights. The\r\nEmpress Catherine, who had counted on seeing her troublesome Prussian\r\nfriend engaged with her detested French enemy, taunted the King of Prussia\r\nwith the loss of his personal honour. Austria, conscious of the antagonism\r\nbetween Prussian and Austrian interests and of the hollow character of the\r\nCoalition, would concede nothing to keep Prussia in arms. Pitt alone was\r\nwilling to make a sacrifice, in order to prevent the rupture of the\r\nalliance. The King of Prussia was ready to continue the struggle with\r\nFrance if his expenses were paid, but not otherwise. Accordingly, after\r\nAustria had refused to contribute the small sum which Pitt asked, a bargain\r\nwas struck between Lord Malmesbury and the Prussian Minister Haugwitz, by\r\nwhich Great Britain undertook to furnish a subsidy, provided that 60,000\r\nPrussian troops, under General Möllendorf, were placed at the disposal of\r\nthe Maritime Powers. [35] It was Pitt's intention that the troops which he\r\nsubsidised should be massed with Austrian and English forces for the\r\ndefence of Belgium: the Prussian Ministry, availing themselves of an\r\nambiguous expression in the treaty, insisted on keeping them inactive upon\r\nthe Upper Rhine. Möllendorf wished to guard Mainz: other men of influence\r\nlonged to abandon the alliance with Austria, and to employ the whole of\r\nPrussia's force in Poland. At the moment when Haugwitz was contracting to\r\nplace Möllendorf's army at Pitt's disposal, Poland had risen in revolt\r\nunder Kosciusko, and the Russian garrison which occupied Warsaw had been\r\noverpowered and cut to pieces. Catherine called upon the King of Prussia\r\nfor assistance; but it was not so much a desire to rescue the Empress from\r\na momentary danger that excited the Prussian Cabinet as the belief that her\r\nvengeance would now make an absolute end of what remained of the Polish\r\nkingdom. The prey was doomed; the wisdom of Prussia was to be the first to\r\nseize and drag it to the ground. So large a prospect offered itself to the\r\nPower that should crush Poland during the brief paralysis of the Russian\r\narms, that, on the first news of the outbreak, the King's advisers urged\r\nhim instantly to make peace with France and to throw his whole strength\r\ninto the Polish struggle. Frederick William could not reconcile himself to\r\nmaking peace with the Jacobins; but he ordered an army to march upon\r\nWarsaw, and shortly afterwards placed himself at its head (May, 1794). When\r\nthe King, who was the only politician in Prussia who took an interest in\r\nthe French war, thus publicly acknowledged the higher importance of the\r\nPolish campaign, his generals upon the Rhine made it their only object to\r\ndo nothing which it was possible to leave undone without actually\r\nforfeiting the British subsidy. Instead of fighting, Möllendorf spent his\r\ntime in urging other people to make peace. It was in vain that Malmesbury\r\nargued that the very object of Pitt's bargain was to keep the French out of\r\nthe Netherlands: Möllendorf had made up his mind that the army should not\r\nbe committed to the orders of Pitt and the Austrians. He continued in the\r\nPalatinate, alleging that any movement of the Prussian army towards the\r\nnorth would give the French admittance to southern Germany. Pitt's hope of\r\ndefending the Netherlands now rested on the energy and on the sincerity of\r\nthe Austrian Cabinet, and on this alone.\r\n\r\n[Battles on the Sambre, May-June, 1794.]\r\n\r\nAfter breaking up from winter quarters in the spring of 1794, the Austrian\r\nand English allied forces had successfully laid siege to Landrecies, and\r\ndefeated the enemy in its neighbourhood. [36] Their advance, however, was\r\nchecked by a movement of the French Army of the North, now commanded by\r\nPichegru, towards the Flemish coast. York and the English troops were\r\nexposed to the attack, and suffered a defeat at Turcoing. The decision of\r\nthe campaign lay, however, not in the west of Flanders, but at the other\r\nend of the Allies' position, at Charleroi on the Sambre, where a French\r\nvictory would either force the Austrians to fall back eastwards, leaving\r\nYork to his fate, or sever their communications with Germany. This became\r\nevident to the French Government; and in May the Commissioners of the\r\nConvention forced the generals on the Sambre to fight a series of battles,\r\nin which the French repeatedly succeeded in crossing the Sambre, and were\r\nrepeatedly driven back again. The fate of the Netherlands depended,\r\nhowever, on something beside victory or defeat on the Sambre. The Emperor\r\nhad come with Baron Thugut to Belgium in the hope of imparting greater\r\nunity and energy to the allied forces, but his presence proved useless.\r\nAmong the Austrian generals and diplomatists there were several who desired\r\nto withdraw from the contest in the Netherlands, and to follow the example\r\nof Prussia in Poland. The action of the army was paralysed by intrigues.\r\n\"Every one,\" wrote Thugut, \"does exactly as he pleases: there is absolute\r\nanarchy and disorder.\" [37] At the beginning of June the Emperor quitted\r\nthe army; the combats on the Sambre were taken up by Jourdan and 50,000\r\nfresh troops brought from the army of the Moselle; and on the 26th of June\r\nthe French defeated Coburg at Fleurus, as he advanced to the relief of\r\nCharleroi, unconscious that Charleroi had surrendered on the day before.\r\nEven now the defence of Belgium was not hopeless; but after one council of\r\nwar had declared in favour of fighting, a second determined on a retreat.\r\nIt was in vain that the representatives of England appealed to the good\r\nfaith and military honour of Austria. Namur and Louvain were abandoned; the\r\nFrench pressed onwards; and before the end of July the Austrian army had\r\nfallen back behind the Meuse. York, forsaken by the allies, retired\r\nnorthwards before the superior forces of Pichegru, who entered Antwerp and\r\nmade himself master of the whole of the Netherlands up to the Dutch\r\nfrontier. [38]\r\n\r\n[England disappointed by the Allies.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the result of Great Britain's well-meant effort to assist the two\r\ngreat military Powers to defend Europe against the Revolution. To the aim\r\nof the English Minister, the defence of existing rights against democratic\r\naggression, most of the public men alike of Austria and Prussia were now\r\nabsolutely indifferent. They were willing to let the French seize and\r\nrevolutionise any territory they pleased, provided that they themselves\r\nobtained their equivalent in Poland. England was in fact in the position of\r\na man who sets out to attack a highway robber, and offers each of his arms\r\nto a pickpocket. The motives and conduct of these politicians were justly\r\nenough described by the English statesmen and generals who were brought\r\ninto closest contact with them. In the councils of Prussia, Malmesbury\r\ndeclared that he could find no quality but \"great and shabby art and\r\ncunning; ill-will, jealousy, and every sort of dirty passion.\" From the\r\nhead quarters of Möllendorf he wrote to a member of Pitt's Cabinet: \"Here I\r\nhave to do with knavery and dotage.... If we listened only to our feelings,\r\nit would be difficult to keep any measure with Prussia. We must consider it\r\nan alliance with the Algerians, whom it is no disgrace to pay, or any\r\nimpeachment of good sense to be cheated by.\" To the Austrian commander the\r\nDuke of York addressed himself with royal plainness: \"Your Serene Highness,\r\nthe British nation, whose public opinion is not to be despised, will\r\nconsider that it has been bought and sold.\" [39]\r\n\r\n[French reach the Rhine, Oct., 1794.]\r\n\r\n[Pichegru conquers Holland, Dec., 1794.]\r\n\r\nThe sorry concert lasted for a few months longer. Coburg, the Austrian\r\ncommander, was dismissed at the peremptory demand of Great Britain; his\r\nsuccessor, Clerfayt, after losing a battle on the Ourthe, offered no\r\nfurther resistance to the advance of the Republican army, and the campaign\r\nended in the capture of Cologne by the French, and the disappearance of the\r\nAustrians behind the Rhine. The Prussian subsidies granted by England\r\nresulted in some useless engagements between Möllendorf's corps in the\r\nPalatinate and a French army double its size, followed by the retreat of\r\nthe Prussians into Mainz. It only remained for Great Britain to attempt to\r\nkeep the French out of Holland. The defence of the Dutch, after everything\r\nsouth of the river Waal had been lost, Pitt determined to entrust to abler\r\nhands than those of the Duke of York; but the presence of one high-born\r\nblunderer more or less made little difference in a series of operations\r\nconceived in indifference and perversity. Clerfayt would not, or could not,\r\nobey the Emperor's orders and succour his ally. City after city in Holland\r\nwelcomed the French. The very elements seemed to declare for the Republic.\r\nPichegru's army marched in safety over the frozen rivers; and, when the\r\nconquest of the land was completed, his cavalry crowned the campaign by the\r\ncapture of the Dutch fleet in the midst of the ice-bound waters of the\r\nTexel. The British regiments, cut off from home, made their way eastward\r\nthrough the snow towards the Hanoverian frontier, in a state of prostrate\r\nmisery which is compared by an eye-witness of both events to that of the\r\nFrench on their retreat in 1813 after the battle of Leipzig. [40]\r\n\r\n[Treaties of Basle with Prussia, April 5, and Spain, July 22, 1795.]\r\n\r\nThe first act of the struggle between France and the Monarchies of Europe\r\nwas concluded. The result of three years of war was that Belgium, Nice, and\r\nSavoy had been added to the territory of the Republic, and that French\r\narmies were in possession of Holland, and the whole of Germany west of the\r\nRhine. In Spain and in Piedmont the mountain-passes and some extent of\r\ncountry had been won. Even on the seas, in spite of the destruction of the\r\nfleet at Toulon, and of a heavy defeat by Lord Howe off Ushant on the 1st\r\nof June, 1794, the strength of France was still formidable; and the losses\r\nwhich she inflicted on the commercial marine of her enemies exceeded those\r\nwhich she herself sustained. England, which had captured most of the French\r\nWest Indian Islands, was the only Power that had wrested anything from the\r\nRepublic. The dream of suppressing the Revolution by force of arms had\r\nvanished away; and the States which had entered upon the contest in levity,\r\nin fanaticism, or at the bidding of more powerful allies, found it\r\nnecessary to make peace upon such terms as they could obtain. Holland, in\r\nwhich a strong Republican party had always maintained connection with\r\nFrance, abolished the rule of its Stadtholder, and placed its resources at\r\nthe disposal of its conquerors. Sardinia entered upon abortive\r\nnegotiations. Spain, in return for peace, ceded to the Republic the Spanish\r\nhalf of St. Domingo (July 22, 1795). Prussia concluded a Treaty at Basle\r\n(April 5), which marked and perpetuated the division of Germany by\r\nproviding that, although the Empire as a body was still at war with France,\r\nthe benefit of Prussia's neutrality should extend to all German States\r\nnorth of a certain line. A secret article stipulated that, upon the\r\nconclusion of a general peace, if the Empire should cede to France the\r\nprincipalities west of the Rhine, Prussia should cede its own territory\r\nlying in that district, and receive compensation elsewhere. [41]\r\n\r\n[Austria and England continue the war, 1795.]\r\n\r\nHumiliating such a peace certainly was; yet it would probably have been the\r\nhappiest issue for Europe had every Power been forced to accept its\r\nconditions. The territory gained by France was not much more than the very\r\nprinciple of the Balance of Power would have entitled it to demand, at a\r\nmoment when Russia, victorious over the Polish rebellion, was proceeding to\r\nmake the final partition of Poland among the three Eastern Monarchies; and,\r\nwith all its faults, the France of 1795 would have offered to Europe the\r\nexample of a great free State, such as the growth of the military spirit\r\nmade impossible after the first of Napoleon's campaigns. But the dark\r\nfuture was withdrawn from the view of those British statesmen who most\r\nkeenly felt the evils of the present; and England, resolutely set against\r\nthe course of French aggression, still found in Austria an ally willing to\r\ncontinue the struggle. The financial help of Great Britain, the Russian\r\noffer of a large share in the spoils of Poland, stimulated the flagging\r\nenergy of the Emperor's government. Orders were sent to Clerfayt to advance\r\nfrom the Rhine at whatever risk, in order to withdraw the troops of the\r\nRepublic from the west of France, where England was about to land a body of\r\nRoyalists. Clerfayt, however, disobeyed his instructions, and remained\r\ninactive till the autumn. He then defeated a French army pushing beyond the\r\nRhine, and drove back the besiegers of Mainz; but the British expedition\r\nhad already failed, and the time was passed when Clerfayt's successes might\r\nhave produced a decisive result. [42]\r\n\r\n[Landing at Quiberon, June 27, 1795.]\r\n\r\n[France in 1795.]\r\n\r\nA new Government was now entering upon power in France. The Reign of Terror\r\nhad ended in July, 1794, with the life of Robespierre. The men by whom\r\nRobespierre was overthrown were Terrorists more cruel and less earnest than\r\nhimself, who attacked him only in order to save their own lives, and\r\nwithout the least intention of restoring a constitutional Government to\r\nFrance. An overwhelming national reaction forced them, however, to\r\nrepresent themselves as the party of clemency. The reaction was indeed a\r\nsimple outburst of human feeling rather than a change in political opinion.\r\nAmong the victims of the Terror the great majority had been men of the\r\nlower or middle class, who, except in La Vendée and Brittany, were as\r\nlittle friendly to the old _régime_ as their executioners. Every class in\r\nFrance, with the exception of the starving city mobs, longed for security,\r\nand the quiet routine of life. After the disorders of the Republic a\r\nmonarchical government naturally seemed to many the best guarantee of\r\npeace; but the monarchy so contemplated was the liberal monarchy of 1791,\r\nnot the ancient Court, with its accessories of a landed Church and\r\nprivileged noblesse. Religion was still a power in France; but the peasant,\r\nwith all his superstition and all his desire for order, was perfectly free\r\nfrom any delusions about the good old times. He liked to see his children\r\nbaptised; but he had no desire to see the priest's tithe-collector back in\r\nhis barn: he shuddered at the summary marketing of Conventional\r\nCommissioners; but he had no wish to resume his labours on the fields of\r\nhis late seigneur. To be a Monarchist in 1795, among the shopkeepers of\r\nParis or the farmers of Normandy, meant no more than to wish for a\r\npolitical system capable of subsisting for twelve months together, and\r\nresting on some other basis than forced loans and compulsory sales of\r\nproperty. But among the men of the Convention, who had abolished monarchy\r\nand passed sentence of death upon the King, the restoration of the Crown\r\nseemed the bitterest condemnation of all that the Convention had done for\r\nFrance, and a sentence of outlawry against themselves. If the will of the\r\nnation was for the moment in favour of a restored monarchy, the Convention\r\ndetermined that its will must be overpowered by force or thwarted by\r\nconstitutional forms. Threatened alternately by the Jacobin mob of Paris\r\nand by the Royalist middle class, the Government played off one enemy\r\nagainst the other, until an ill-timed effort of the emigrant noblesse gave\r\nto the Convention the prestige of a decisive victory over Royalists and\r\nforeigners combined. On the 27th of June, 1795, an English fleet landed the\r\nflower of the old nobility of France at the Bay of Quiberon in southern\r\nBrittany. It was only to give one last fatal proof of their incapacity that\r\nthese unhappy men appeared once more on French soil. Within three weeks\r\nafter their landing, in a region where for years together the peasantry,\r\nled by their landlords, baffled the best generals of the Republic, this\r\ninvading army of the nobles, supported by the fleet, the arms, and the\r\nmoney of England, was brought to utter ruin by the discord of its own\r\nleaders. Before the nobles had settled who was to command and who was to\r\nobey, General Hoche surprised their fort, beat them back to the edge of the\r\npeninsula where they had landed, and captured all who were not killed\r\nfighting or rescued by English boats (July 20). The Commissioner Tallien,\r\nin order to purge himself from the just suspicion of Royalist intrigues,\r\ncaused six hundred prisoners to be shot in cold blood. [43]\r\n\r\n[Project of Constitution, 1795.]\r\n\r\nAt the moment when the emigrant army reached France, the Convention was\r\nengaged in discussing the political system which was to succeed its own\r\nrule. A week earlier, the Committee appointed to draw up a new constitution\r\nfor France had presented its report. The main object of the new\r\nconstitution in its original form was to secure France against a recurrence\r\nof those evils which it had suffered since 1792. The calamities of the last\r\nthree years were ascribed to the sovereignty of a single Assembly. A vote\r\nof the Convention had established the Revolutionary Tribunal, proscribed\r\nthe Girondins, and placed France at the mercy of eighty individuals\r\nselected by the Convention from itself. The legislators of 1795 desired a\r\nguarantee that no party, however determined, should thus destroy its\r\nenemies by a single law, and unite supreme legislative and executive power\r\nin its own hands. With the object of dividing authority, the executive was,\r\nin the new draft-constitution, made independent of the legislature, and the\r\nlegislature itself was broken up into two chambers. A Directory of five\r\nmembers, chosen by the Assemblies, but not responsible except under actual\r\nimpeachment, was to conduct the administration, without the right of\r\nproposing laws; a Chamber of five hundred was to submit laws to the\r\napproval of a Council of two hundred and fifty Ancients, or men of middle\r\nlife; but neither of these bodies was to exercise any influence upon the\r\nactual government. One director and a third part of each of the legislative\r\nbodies were to retire every year. [44]\r\n\r\n[Constitution of 1795. Insurrection of Vendémiaire, Oct. 4.]\r\n\r\nThe project thus outlined met with general approval, and gained even that\r\nof the Royalists, who believed that a popular election would place them in\r\na majority in the two new Assemblies. Such an event was, however, in the\r\neyes of the Convention, the one fatal possibility that must be averted at\r\nevery cost. In the midst of the debates upon the draft-constitution there\r\narrived the news of Hoche's victory at Quiberon. The Convention gained\r\ncourage to add a clause providing that two-thirds of the new deputies\r\nshould be appointed from among its own members, thus rendering a Royalist\r\nmajority in the Chambers impossible. With this condition attached to it,\r\nthe Constitution was laid before the country. The provinces accepted it;\r\nthe Royalist middle class of Paris rose in insurrection, and marched\r\nagainst the Convention in the Tuileries. Their revolt was foreseen; the\r\ndefence of the Convention was entrusted to General Bonaparte, who met the\r\nattack of the Parisians in a style unknown in the warfare of the capital.\r\nBonaparte's command of trained artillery secured him victory; but the\r\nstruggle of the 4th of October (13 Vendémiaire) was the severest that took\r\nplace in Paris during the Revolution, and the loss of life in fighting\r\ngreater than on the day that overthrew the Monarchy.\r\n\r\n[The Directory, Oct., 1795.]\r\n\r\nThe new Government of France now entered into power. Members of the\r\nConvention formed two-thirds of the new legislative bodies; the one-third\r\nwhich the country was permitted to elect consisted chiefly of men of\r\nmoderate or Royalist opinions. The five persons who were chosen Directors\r\nwere all Conventionalists who had voted for the death of the King; Carnot,\r\nhowever, who had won the victories without sharing in the cruelties of the\r\nReign of Terror, was the only member of the late Committee of Public Safety\r\nwho was placed in power. In spite of the striking homage paid to the great\r\nact of regicide in the election of the five Directors, the establishment of\r\nthe Directory was accepted by Europe as the close of revolutionary\r\ndisorder. The return of constitutional rule in France was marked by a\r\ndeclaration on the part of the King of England of his willingness to treat\r\nfor peace. A gentler spirit seemed to have arisen in the Republic. Although\r\nthe laws against the emigrants and non-juring priests were still\r\nunrepealed, the exiles began to return unmolested to their homes. Life\r\nresumed something of its old aspect in the capital. The rich and the gay\r\nconsoled themselves with costlier luxury for all the austerities of the\r\nReign of Terror. The labouring classes, now harmless and disarmed, were\r\nsharply taught that they must be content with such improvement in their lot\r\nas the progress of society might bring.\r\n\r\n[What was new to Europe in the Revolution.]\r\n\r\n[Absolute governments of 18th century engaged in reforms.]\r\n\r\nAt the close of this first period of the Revolutionary War we may pause to\r\nmake an estimate of the new influences which the French Revolution had\r\nbrought into Europe, and of the effects which had thus far resulted from\r\nthem. The opinion current among the French people themselves, that the\r\nRevolution gave birth to the modern life not of France only but of the\r\nWestern Continent generally, is true of one great set of facts; it is\r\nuntrue of another. There were conceptions in France in 1789 which made\r\nFrance a real contrast to most of the Continental monarchies; there were\r\nothers which it shared in common with them. The ideas of social, legal, and\r\necclesiastical reform which were realised in 1789 were not peculiar to\r\nFrance; what was peculiar to France was the idea that these reforms were to\r\nbe effected by the nation itself. In other countries reforms had been\r\ninitiated by Governments, and forced upon an unwilling people. Innovation\r\nsprang from the Crown; its agents were the servants of the State. A\r\ndistinct class of improvements, many of them identical with the changes\r\nmade by the Revolution in France, attracted the attention in a greater or\r\nless degree of almost all the Western Courts of the eighteenth century. The\r\ncreation of a simple and regular administrative system; the reform of the\r\nclergy; the emancipation of the Church from the jurisdiction of the Pope,\r\nand of all orders in the State from the jurisdiction of the Church; the\r\namelioration of the lot of the peasant; the introduction of codes of law\r\nabolishing both the cruelties and the confusion of ancient practice,--all\r\nthese were purposes more or less familiar to the absolute sovereigns of the\r\neighteenth century, whom the French so summarily described as benighted\r\ntyrants. It was in Austria, Prussia, and Tuscany that the civilising energy\r\nof the Crown had been seen in its strongest form, but even the Governments\r\nof Naples and Spain had caught the spirit of change. The religious\r\ntolerance which Joseph gave to Austria, the rejection of Papal authority\r\nand the abolition of the punishment of death which Leopold effected in\r\nTuscany, were bolder efforts of the same political rationalism which in\r\nSpain minimised the powers of the Inquisition and in Naples attempted to\r\nfound a system of public education. In all this, however, there was no\r\ntrace of the action of the people, or of any sense that a nation ought to\r\nraise itself above a state of tutelage. Men of ideas called upon\r\nGovernments to impose better institutions upon the people, not upon the\r\npeople to wrest them from the Governments.\r\n\r\n[In France, the nation itself acted.]\r\n\r\nIn France alone a view of public affairs had grown up which impelled the\r\nnation to create its reforms for itself. If the substance of many of the\r\nFrench revolutionary changes coincided with the objects of Austrian or of\r\nTuscan reform, there was nothing similar in their method. In other\r\ncountries reform sprang from the command of an enlightened ruler; in France\r\nit started with the Declaration of the Rights of Man, and aimed at the\r\ncreation of local authority to be exercised by the citizens themselves. The\r\nsource of this difference lay partly in the influence of England and\r\nAmerica upon French opinion, but much more in the existence within France\r\nof a numerous and energetic middle class, enriched by commerce, and keenly\r\ninterested in all the speculation and literary activity of the age. This\r\nwas a class that both understood the wrongs which the other classes\r\ninflicted or suffered, and felt itself capable of redressing them. For the\r\nflogged and over-driven peasant in Naples or Hungary no ally existed but\r\nthe Crown. In most of those poor and backward States which made up\r\nmonarchical Europe, the fraction of the inhabitants which neither enjoyed\r\nprivilege nor stood in bondage to it was too small to think of forcing\r\nitself into power. The nobles sought to preserve their feudal rights: the\r\nCrown sought to reduce them; the nation, elsewhere than in France, did not\r\nintervene and lay hands upon power for itself, because the nation was\r\nnothing but the four mutually exclusive classes of the landlords who\r\ncommanded, the peasants who served, the priests who idled, and the soldiers\r\nwho fought. France differed from all the other monarchies of the Continent\r\nin possessing a public which blended all classes and was dominated by none;\r\na public comprehending thousands of men who were familiar with the great\r\ninterests of society, and who, whether noble or not noble, possessed the\r\nwealth and the intelligence that made them rightly desire a share in power.\r\n\r\n[Movements against governments outside France.]\r\n\r\nLiberty, the right of the nation to govern itself, seemed at the outset to\r\nbe the great principle of the Revolution. The French people themselves\r\nbelieved the question at issue to be mainly between authority and popular\r\nright; the rest of Europe saw the Revolution under the same aspect. Hence,\r\nin those countries where the example of France produced political\r\nmovements, the effect was in the first instance to excite agitation against\r\nthe Government, whatever might be the form of the latter. In England the\r\nagitation was one of the middle class against the aristocratic\r\nparliamentary system; in Hungary, it was an agitation of the nobles against\r\nthe Crown; on the Rhine it was an agitation of the commercial classes\r\nagainst ecclesiastical rule. But in every case in which the reforming\r\nmovement was not supported by the presence of French armies, the terrors\r\nwhich succeeded the first sanguine hopes of the Revolution struck the\r\nleaders of these movements with revulsion and despair, and converted even\r\nthe better Governments into engines of reaction. In France itself it was\r\nseen that the desire for liberty among an enlightened class could not\r\nsuddenly transform the habits of a nation accustomed to accept everything\r\nfrom authority. Privilege was destroyed, equality was advanced; but instead\r\nof self-government the Revolution brought France the most absolute rule it\r\nhad ever known. It was not that the Revolution had swept by, leaving things\r\nwhere they were before: it had in fact accomplished most of those great\r\nchanges which lay the foundation of a sound social life: but the faculty of\r\nself-government, the first condition of any lasting political liberty,\r\nremained to be slowly won.\r\n\r\n[Reaction.]\r\n\r\nOutside France reaction set in without the benefit of previous change. At\r\nLondon, Vienna, Naples, and Madrid, Governments gave up all other objects\r\nin order to devote themselves to the suppression of Jacobinism. Pitt, whose\r\nnoble aims had been the extinction of the slave-trade, the reform of\r\nParliament, and the advance of national intercourse by free trade,\r\nsurrendered himself to men whose thoughts centred upon informers, Gagging\r\nActs, and constructive treasons, and who opposed all legislation upon the\r\nslave-trade because slaves had been freed by the Jacobins of the\r\nConvention. State trials and imprisonments became the order of the day; but\r\nthe reaction in England at least stopped short of the scaffold. At Vienna\r\nand Naples fear was more cruel. The men who either were, or affected to be,\r\nin such fear of revolution that they discovered a Jacobinical allegory in\r\nMozart's last opera, [45] did not spare life when the threads of anything\r\nlike a real conspiracy were placed in their hands. At Vienna terror was\r\nemployed to crush the constitutional opposition of Hungary to the Austrian\r\nCourt. In Naples a long reign of cruelty and oppression began with the\r\ncreation of a secret tribunal to investigate charges of conspiracy made by\r\ninformers. In Mainz, the Archbishop occupied the last years of his\r\ngovernment, after his restoration in 1793, with a series of brutal\r\npunishments and tyrannical precautions.\r\n\r\nThese were but instances of the effect which the first epoch of the\r\nRevolution produced upon the old European States. After a momentary\r\nstimulus to freedom it threw the nations themselves into reaction and\r\napathy; it totally changed the spirit of the better governments, attaching\r\nto all liberal ideas the stigma of Revolution, and identifying the work of\r\nauthority with resistance to every kind of reform. There were States in\r\nwhich this change, the first effect of the Revolution, was also its only\r\none; States whose history, as in the case of England, is for a whole\r\ngeneration the history of political progress unnaturally checked and thrown\r\nout of its course. There were others, and these the more numerous, where\r\nthe first stimulus and the first reaction were soon forgotten in new and\r\npenetrating changes produced by the successive victories of France. The\r\nnature of these changes, even more than the warfare which introduced them,\r\ngives its interest to the period on which we are about to enter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nTriple attack on Austria--Moreau, Jourdan--Bonaparte in Italy--Condition of\r\nthe Italian States--Professions and real intentions of Bonaparte and the\r\nDirectory--Battle of Montenotte--Armistice with Sardinia--Campaign in\r\nLombardy--Treatment of the Pope, Naples, Tuscany--Siege of Mantua--\r\nCastiglione, Moreau and Jourdan in Germany Their retreat--Secret Treaty\r\nwith Prussia--Negotiations with England--Cispadane Republic--Rise of the\r\nidea of Italian Independence--Battles of Arcola and Rivoli--Peace with the\r\nPope at Tolentino--Venice--Preliminaries of Leoben--The French in\r\nVenice--The French take the Ionian Islands and give Venice to\r\nAustria--Genoa--Coup d'état of 17 Fructidor in Paris--Treaty of Campo\r\nFormio--Victories of England at sea--Bonaparte's project against Egypt.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Armies of Italy, the Danube, and the Main, 1796.]\r\n\r\nWith the opening of the year 1796 the leading interest of European history\r\npasses to a new scene. Hitherto the progress of French victory had been in\r\nthe direction of the Rhine: the advance of the army of the Pyrenees had\r\nbeen cut short by the conclusion of peace with Spain; the army of Italy had\r\nachieved little beyond some obscure successes in the mountains. It was the\r\nappointment of Napoleon Bonaparte to the command of the latter force, in\r\nthe spring of 1796, that first centred the fortunes of the Republic in the\r\nland beyond the Alps. Freed from Prussia by the Treaty of Basle, the\r\nDirectory was now able to withdraw its attention from Holland and from the\r\nLower Rhine, and to throw its whole force into the struggle with Austria.\r\nBy the advice of Bonaparte a threefold movement was undertaken against\r\nVienna, by way of Lombardy, by the valley of the Danube, and by the valley\r\nof the Main. General Jourdan, in command of the army that had conquered the\r\nNetherlands, was ordered to enter Germany by Frankfort; Moreau crossed the\r\nRhine at Strasburg: Bonaparte himself, drawing his scanty supplies along\r\nthe coast-road from Nice, faced the allied forces of Austria and Sardinia\r\nupon the slopes of the Maritime Apennines, forty miles to the west of\r\nGenoa. The country in which he was about to operate was familiar to\r\nBonaparte from service there in 1794; his own descent and language gave him\r\nsingular advantages in any enterprise undertaken in Italy. Bonaparte was no\r\nItalian at heart; but he knew at least enough of the Italian nature to work\r\nupon its better impulses, and to attach its hopes, so long as he needed the\r\nsupport of Italian opinion, to his own career of victory.\r\n\r\n[Condition of Italy.]\r\n\r\nThree centuries separated the Italy of that day from the bright and\r\nvigorous Italy which, in the glow of its Republican freedom, had given so\r\nmuch to Northern Europe in art, in letters, and in the charm of life. A\r\nlong epoch of subjection to despotic or foreign rule, of commercial\r\ninaction, of decline in mind and character, had made the Italians of no\r\naccount among the political forces of Europe. Down to the peace of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle in 1748 their provinces were bartered between the Bourbons\r\nand the Hapsburgs; and although the settlement of that date left no part of\r\nItaly, except the Duchy of Milan, incorporated in a foreign empire, yet the\r\ncrown of Naples was vested in a younger branch of the Spanish Bourbons, and\r\nthe marriage of Maria Theresa with the Archduke Francis made Tuscany an\r\nappanage of the House of Austria. Venice and Genoa retained their\r\nindependence and their republican government, but little of their ancient\r\nspirit. At the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, Austrian influence was\r\ndominant throughout the peninsula, Marie Caroline, the Queen and the ruler\r\nof Ferdinand of Naples, being the sister of the Emperor Leopold and Marie\r\nAntoinette. With the exception of Piedmont, which preserved a strong\r\nmilitary sentiment and the tradition of an active and patriotic policy, the\r\nItalian States were either, like Venice and Genoa, anxious to keep\r\nthemselves out of danger by seeming to hear and see nothing that passed\r\naround them, or governed by families in the closest connection with the\r\ngreat reigning Houses of the Continent. Neither in Italy itself, nor in the\r\ngeneral course of European affairs during the Napoleonic period, was\r\nanything determined by the sentiment of the Italian people. The peasantry\r\nat times fought against the French with energy; but no strong impulse, like\r\nthat of the Spaniards, enlisted the upper class of Italians either on the\r\nside of Napoleon or on that of his enemies. Acquiescence and submission had\r\nbecome the habit of the race; the sense of national unity and worth, the\r\npersonal pride which makes the absence of liberty an intolerable wrong,\r\nonly entered the Italian character at a later date.\r\n\r\n[Revival after 1740.]\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of its political nullity, Italy was not in a state of\r\ndecline. Its worst days had ended before the middle of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. The fifty years preceding the French Revolution, if they had\r\nbrought nothing of the spirit of liberty, had in all other respects been\r\nyears of progress and revival. In Lombardy the government of Maria Theresa\r\nand Joseph awoke life and motion after ages of Spanish torpor and misrule.\r\nTraditions of local activity revived; the communes were encouraged in their\r\nworks of irrigation and rural improvement; a singular liberality towards\r\npublic opinion and the press made the Austrian possessions the centre of\r\nthe intellectual movement of Italy. In the south, progress began on the day\r\nwhen the last foreign Viceroy disappeared from Naples (1735), and King\r\nCharles III., though a member of the Spanish House, entered upon the\r\ngovernment of the two Sicilies as an independent kingdom. Venice and the\r\nPapal States alone seemed to be untouched by the spirit of material and\r\nsocial improvement, so active in the rest of Italy before the interest in\r\npolitical life had come into being.\r\n\r\nNor was the age without its intellectual distinction. If the literature of\r\nItaly in the second half of the eighteenth century had little that recalled\r\nthe inspiration of its splendid youth, it showed at least a return to\r\nseriousness and an interest in important things. The political economists\r\nof Lombardy were scarcely behind those of England; the work of the Milanese\r\nBeccaria on \"Crimes and Punishments\" stimulated the reform of criminal law\r\nin every country in Europe; an intelligent and increasing attention to\r\nproblems of agriculture, commerce, and education took the place of the\r\nfatuous gallantries and insipid criticism which had hitherto made up the\r\nlife of Italians of birth and culture. One man of genius, Vittorio Alfieri,\r\nthe creator of Italian tragedy, idealised both in prose and verse a type of\r\nrugged independence and resistance to tyrannical power. Alfieri was neither\r\na man of political judgment himself nor the representative of any real\r\npolitical current in Italy; but the lesson which he taught to the Italians,\r\nthe lesson of respect for themselves and their country, was the one which\r\nItaly most of all required to learn; and the appearance of this manly and\r\nenergetic spirit in its literature gave hope that the Italian nation would\r\nnot long be content to remain without political being.\r\n\r\n[Social condition.]\r\n\r\n[Tuscany.]\r\n\r\nItaly, to the outside world, meant little more than the ruins of the Roman\r\nForum, the galleries of Florence, the paradise of Capri and the Neapolitan\r\ncoast; the singular variety in its local conditions of life gained little\r\nattention from the foreigner. There were districts in Italy where the\r\nsocial order was almost of a Polish type of barbarism; there were others\r\nwhere the rich and the poor lived perhaps under a happier relation than in\r\nany other country in Europe. The difference depended chiefly upon the\r\nextent to which municipal life had in past time superseded the feudal order\r\nunder which the territorial lord was the judge and the ruler of his own\r\ndomain. In Tuscany the city had done the most in absorbing the landed\r\nnobility; in Naples and Sicily it had done the least. When, during the\r\nmiddle ages, the Republic of Florence forced the feudal lords who\r\nsurrounded it to enter its walls as citizens, in some cases it deprived\r\nthem of all authority, in others it permitted them to retain a jurisdiction\r\nover their peasants; but even in these instances the sovereignty of the\r\ncity deprived the feudal relation of most of its harshness and force. After\r\nthe loss of Florentine liberty, the Medici, aping the custom of older\r\nmonarchies, conferred the title of marquis and count upon men who preferred\r\nservitude to freedom, and accompanied the grant of rank with one of\r\nhereditary local authority; but the new institutions took no deep hold on\r\ncountry life, and the legislation of the first Archduke of the House of\r\nLorraine (1749) left the landed aristocracy in the position of mere country\r\ngentlemen. [46] Estates were not very large: the prevalent agricultural\r\nsystem was, as it still is, that of the _mezzeria_, a partnership between\r\nthe landlord and tenant; the tenant holding by custom in perpetuity, and\r\nsharing the produce with the landlord, who supplied a part of the stock and\r\nmaterials for farming. In Tuscany the conditions of the _mezzeria_ were\r\nextremely favourable to the tenant; and if a cheerful country life under a\r\nmild and enlightened government were all that a State need desire, Tuscany\r\nenjoyed rare happiness.\r\n\r\n[Naples and Sicily.]\r\n\r\n[Piedmont.]\r\n\r\nFar different was the condition of Sicily and Naples. Here the growth of\r\ncity life had never affected the rough sovereignty which the barons\r\nexercised over great tracts of country withdrawn from the civilised world.\r\nWhen Charles III. ascended the throne in 1735, he found whole provinces in\r\nwhich there was absolutely no administration of justice on the part of the\r\nState. The feudal rights of the nobility were in the last degree\r\noppressive, the barbarism of the people was in many districts extreme. Out\r\nof two thousand six hundred towns and villages in the kingdom, there were\r\nonly fifty that were not subject to feudal authority. In the manor of San\r\nGennaro di Palma, fifteen miles from Naples, even down to the year 1786 the\r\nofficers of the baron were the only persons who lived in houses; the\r\npeasants, two thousand in number, slept among the corn-ricks. [47] Charles,\r\nduring his tenure of the Neapolitan crown, from 1735 to 1759, and the\r\nMinisters Tanucci and Caraccioli under his feeble successor Ferdinand IV.,\r\nenforced the authority of the State in justice and administration, and\r\nabolished some of the most oppressive feudal rights of the nobility; but\r\ntheir legislation, though bold and even revolutionary according to an\r\nEnglish standard, could not in the course of two generations transform a\r\nsocial system based upon centuries of misgovernment and disorder. At the\r\noutbreak of the French Revolution the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was, as\r\nit still in a less degree is, a land of extreme inequalities of wealth and\r\npoverty, a land where great estates wasted in the hands of oppressive or\r\nindolent owners, and the peasantry, untrained either by remunerative\r\nindustry or by a just and regular enforcement of the law, found no better\r\nguide than a savage and fanatical priesthood. Over the rest of Italy the\r\nconditions of life varied through all degrees between the Tuscan and the\r\nNeapolitan type. Piedmont, in military spirit and patriotism far superior\r\nto the other Italian States, was socially one of the most backward of all.\r\nIt was a land of priests, nobles, and soldiers, where a gloomy routine and\r\nthe repression of all originality of thought and character drove the most\r\ngifted of its children, like the poet Alfieri, to seek a home on some more\r\nliberal soil.\r\n\r\n[Professions and real intentions of the Directory and Bonaparte, 1796.]\r\n\r\nDuring the first years of the Revolution, an attempt had been made by\r\nFrench enthusiasts to extend the Revolution into Italy by means of\r\nassociations in the principal towns; but it met with no great success. A\r\ncertain liberal movement arose among the young men of the upper classes at\r\nNaples, where, under the influence of Queen Marie Caroline, the Government\r\nhad now become reactionary; and in Turin and several of the Lombard cities\r\nthe French were not without partisans; but no general disaffection like\r\nthat of Savoy existed east of the Alps. The agitation of 1789 and 1792 had\r\npassed by without bringing either liberty or national independence to the\r\nItalians. When Bonaparte received his command, that fervour of Republican\r\npassion which, in the midst of violence and wrong, had seldom been wanting\r\nin the first leaders of the Revolutionary War, had died out in France. The\r\npoliticians who survived the Reign of Terror and gained office in the\r\nDirectory repeated the old phrases about the Rights of Man and the\r\nLiberation of the Peoples only as a mode of cajolery. Bonaparte entered\r\nItaly proclaiming himself the restorer of Italian freedom, but with the\r\ndeliberate purpose of using Italy as a means of recruiting the exhausted\r\ntreasury of France. His correspondence with the Directory exposes with\r\nbrazen frankness this well-considered system of pillage and deceit, in\r\nwhich the general and the Government were cordially at one. On the further\r\nquestion, how France should dispose of any territory that might be\r\nconquered in Northern Italy, Bonaparte and the Directory had formed no\r\nunderstanding, and their purposes were in fact at variance. The Directory\r\nwished to conquer Lombardy in order to hand it back to Austria in return\r\nfor the Netherlands; Bonaparte had at least formed the conception that an\r\nItalian State was possible, and he intended to convert either Austrian\r\nLombardy itself, or some other portion of Northern Italy, into a Republic,\r\nserving as a military outwork for France.\r\n\r\n[Bonaparte separates the Austrian and Sardinian Armies, April, 1796.]\r\n\r\n[Armistice and peace with Sardinia.]\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1796 commenced in April, in the mountains above the\r\ncoast-road connecting Nice and Genoa. Bonaparte's own army numbered 40,000\r\nmen; the force opposed to it consisted of 38,000 Austrians, under Beaulieu,\r\nand a smaller Sardinian army, so placed upon the Piedmontese Apennines as\r\nto block the passes from the coast-road into Piedmont, and to threaten the\r\nrear of the French if they advanced eastward against Genoa. The Piedmontese\r\narmy drew its supplies from Turin, the Austrian from Mantua; to sever the\r\ntwo armies was to force them on to lines of retreat conducting them farther\r\nand farther apart from one another. Bonaparte foresaw the effect which such\r\na separation of the two armies would produce upon the Sardinian Government.\r\nFor four days he reiterated his attacks at Montenotte and Millesimo, until\r\nhe had forced his own army into a position in the centre of the Allies;\r\nthen, leaving a small force to watch the Austrians, he threw the mass of\r\nhis troops upon the Piedmontese, and drove them back to within thirty miles\r\nof Turin. The terror-stricken Government, anticipating an outbreak in the\r\ncapital itself, accepted an armistice from Bonaparte at Cherasco (April\r\n28), and handed over to the French the fortresses of Coni, Ceva, and\r\nTortona, which command the entrances of Italy. It was an unworthy\r\ncapitulation for Turin could not have been taken before the Austrians\r\nreturned in force; but Bonaparte had justly calculated the effect of his\r\nvictory; and the armistice, which was soon followed by a treaty of peace\r\nbetween France and Sardinia, ceding Savoy to the Republic, left him free to\r\nfollow the Austrians, untroubled by the existence of some of the strongest\r\nfortresses of Europe behind him.\r\n\r\n[Bridge of Lodi, May 10.]\r\n\r\nIn the negotiations with Sardinia Bonaparte demanded the surrender of the\r\ntown of Valenza, as necessary to secure his passage over the river Po.\r\nHaving thus led the Austrian Beaulieu to concentrate his forces at this\r\npoint, he suddenly moved eastward along the southern bank of the river, and\r\ncrossed at Piacenza, fifty miles below the spot where Beaulieu was awaiting\r\nhim. It was an admirable movement. The Austrian general, with the enemy\r\nthreatening his communications, had to abandon Milan and all the country\r\nwest of it, and to fall back upon the line of the Adda. Bonaparte followed,\r\nand on the 10th of May attacked the Austrians at Lodi. He himself stormed\r\nthe bridge of Lodi at the head of his Grenadiers. The battle was so\r\ndisastrous to the Austrians that they could risk no second engagement, and\r\nretired upon Mantua and the line of the Mincio. [48]\r\n\r\n[Bonaparte in Milan. Extortions.]\r\n\r\nBonaparte now made his triumphal entry into Milan (May 15). The splendour\r\nof his victories and his warm expressions of friendship for Italy excited\r\nthe enthusiasm of a population not hitherto hostile to Austrian rule. A new\r\npolitical movement began. With the French army there came all the partisans\r\nof the French Republic who had been expelled from other parts of Italy.\r\nUniting with the small revolutionary element already existing in Milan,\r\nthey began to form a new public opinion by means of journals and patriotic\r\nmeetings. It was of the utmost importance to Bonaparte that a Republican\r\nparty should be organised among the better classes in the towns of\r\nLombardy; for the depredations of the French army exasperated the peasants,\r\nand Bonaparte's own measures were by no means of a character to win him\r\nunmixed goodwill. The instructions which he received from the Directory\r\nwere extremely simple. \"Leave nothing in Italy,\" they wrote to him on the\r\nday of his entry into Milan, \"which will be useful to us, and which the\r\npolitical situation will allow you to remove.\" If Bonaparte had felt any\r\ndoubt as to the meaning of such an order, the pillage of works of art in\r\nBelgium and Holland in preceding years would have shown him that it was\r\nmeant to be literally interpreted. Accordingly, in return for the gift of\r\nliberty, the Milanese were invited to offer to their deliverers twenty\r\nmillion francs, and a selection from the paintings in their churches and\r\ngalleries. The Dukes of Parma and Modena, in return for an armistice, were\r\nrequired to hand over forty of their best pictures, and a sum of money\r\nproportioned to their revenues. The Dukes and the townspeople paid their\r\ncontributions with good grace: the peasantry of Lombardy, whose cattle were\r\nseized in order to supply an army that marched without any stores of its\r\nown, rose in arms, and threw themselves into Pavia, killing all the French\r\nsoldiers who fell in their way. The revolt was instantly suppressed, and\r\nthe town of Pavia given up to pillage. In deference to the Liberal party of\r\nItaly, the movement was described as a conspiracy of priests and nobles.\r\n\r\n[Venice.]\r\n\r\n[Battle on the Mincio, May 29.]\r\n\r\nThe way into Central Italy now lay open before Bonaparte. Rome and Naples\r\nwere in no condition to offer resistance; but with true military judgment\r\nthe French general declined to move against this feeble prey until the army\r\nof Austria, already crippled, was completely driven out of the field.\r\nInstead of crossing the Apennines, Bonaparte advanced against the Austrian\r\npositions upon the Mincio. It suited him to violate the neutrality of the\r\nadjacent Venetian territory by seizing the town of Brescia. His example was\r\nfollowed by Beaulieu, who occupied Peschiera, at the foot of the Lake of\r\nGarda, and thus held the Mincio along its whole course from the lake to\r\nMantua. A battle was fought and lost by the Austrians half-way between the\r\nlake and the fortress. Beaulieu's strength was exhausted; he could meet the\r\nenemy no more in the field, and led his army out of Italy into the Tyrol,\r\nleaving Mantua to be invested by the French. The first care of the\r\nconqueror was to make Venice pay for the crime of possessing territory\r\nintervening between the eastern and western extremes of the Austrian\r\ndistrict. Bonaparte affected to believe that the Venetians had permitted\r\nBeaulieu to occupy Peschiera before he seized upon Brescia himself. He\r\nuttered terrifying threats to the envoys who came from Venice to excuse an\r\nimaginary crime. He was determined to extort money from the Venetian\r\nRepublic; he also needed a pretext for occupying Verona, and for any future\r\nwrongs. \"I have purposely devised this rupture,\" he wrote to the Directory\r\n(June 7th), \"in case you should wish to obtain five or six millions of\r\nfrancs from Venice. If you have more decided intentions, I think it would\r\nbe well to keep up the quarrel.\" The intention referred to was the\r\ndisgraceful project of sacrificing Venice to Austria in return for the\r\ncession of the Netherlands, a measure based on plans familiar to Thugut as\r\nearly as the year 1793. [49]\r\n\r\n[Armistice with Naples, June 6.]\r\n\r\n[Armistice with the Pope, June 23.]\r\n\r\nThe Austrians were fairly driven out of Lombardy, and Bonaparte was now\r\nfree to deal with southern Italy. He advanced into the States of the\r\nChurch, and expelled the Papal Legate from Bologna. Ferdinand of Naples,\r\nwho had lately called heaven and earth to witness the fury of his zeal\r\nagainst an accursed horde of regicides, thought it prudent to stay\r\nBonaparte's hand, at least until the Austrians were in a condition to renew\r\nthe war in Lombardy. He asked for a suspension of hostilities against his\r\nown kingdom. The fleet and the sea-board of Naples gave it importance in\r\nthe struggle between France and England, and Bonaparte granted the king an\r\narmistice on easy terms. The Pope, in order to gain a few months' truce,\r\nhad to permit the occupation of Ferrara, Ravenna, and Ancona, and to\r\nrecognise the necessities, the learning, the taste, and the virtue of his\r\nconquerors by a gift of twenty million francs, five hundred manuscripts, a\r\nhundred pictures, and the busts of Marcus and Lucius Brutus. The rule of\r\nthe Pope was unpopular in Bologna, and a Senate which Bonaparte placed in\r\npower, pending the formation of a popular Government gladly took the oath\r\nof fidelity to the French Republic. Tuscany was the only State that\r\nremained to be dealt with. Tuscany had indeed made peace with the Republic\r\na year before, but the ships and cargoes of the English merchants at\r\nLeghorn were surely fair prey; and, with the pretence of punishing insults\r\noffered by the English to the French flag, Bonaparte descended upon\r\nLeghorn, and seized upon everything that was not removed before his\r\napproach. Once established in Leghorn, the French declined to quit it. By\r\nway of adjusting the relations of the Grand Duke, the English seized his\r\nharbour of Porto Ferraio, in the island of Elba.\r\n\r\n[Battles of Lonato and Castiglione, July, Aug., 1796.]\r\n\r\nMantua was meanwhile invested, and thither, after his brief incursion into\r\nCentral Italy, Bonaparte returned. Towards the end of July an Austrian\r\nrelieving army, nearly double the strength of Bonaparte's, descended from\r\nthe Tyrol. It was divided into three corps: one, under Quosdanovich,\r\nadvanced by the road on the west of Lake Garda; the others, under Wurmser,\r\nthe commander-in-chief, by the roads between the lake and the river Adige.\r\nThe peril of the French was extreme; their outlying divisions were defeated\r\nand driven in; Bonaparte could only hope to save himself by collecting all\r\nhis forces at the foot of the lake, and striking at one or other of the\r\nAustrian armies before they effected their junction on the Mincio. He\r\ninstantly broke up the siege of Mantua, and withdrew from every position\r\neast of the river. On the 30th of July, Quosdanovich was attacked and\r\nchecked at Lonato, on the west of the Lake of Garda. Wurmser, unaware of\r\nhis colleague's repulse, entered Mantua in triumph, and then set out,\r\nexpecting to envelop Bonaparte between two fires. But the French were ready\r\nfor his approach. Wurmser was stopped and defeated at Castiglione, while\r\nthe western Austrian divisions were still held in check at Lonato. The\r\njunction of the Austrian armies had become impossible. In five days the\r\nskill of Bonaparte and the unsparing exertions of his soldiery had more\r\nthan retrieved all that appeared to have been lost. [50] The Austrians\r\nretired into the Tyrol, beaten and dispirited, and leaving 15,000 prisoners\r\nin the hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\nBonaparte now prepared to force his way into Germany by the Adige, in\r\nfulfilment of the original plan of the campaign. In the first days of\r\nSeptember he again routed the Austrians, and gained possession of Roveredo\r\nand Trent. Wurmser hereupon attempted to shut the French up in the\r\nmountains by a movement southwards; but, while he operated with\r\ninsufficient forces between the Brenta and the Adige, he was cut off from\r\nGermany, and only escaped capture by throwing himself into Mantua with the\r\nshattered remnant of his army. The road into Germany through the Tyrol now\r\nlay open; but in the midst of his victories Bonaparte learnt that the\r\nnorthern armies of Moreau and Jourdan, with which he had intended to\r\nco-operate in an attack upon Vienna, were in full retreat.\r\n\r\n[Invasion of Germany by Moreau and Jourdan, June-Oct., 1796.]\r\n\r\n[The Archduke Charles overpowers Jourdan.]\r\n\r\nMoreau's advance into the valley of the Danube had, during the months of\r\nJuly and August, been attended with unbroken military and political\r\nsuccess. The Archduke Charles, who was entrusted with the defence of the\r\nEmpire, found himself unable to bring two armies into the field capable of\r\nresisting those of Moreau and Jourdan separately, and he therefore\r\ndetermined to fall back before Moreau towards Nuremberg, ordering\r\nWartensleben, who commanded the troops facing Jourdan on the Main, to\r\nretreat in the same direction, in order that the two armies might throw\r\ntheir collected force upon Jourdan while still at some distance north of\r\nMoreau. [51] The design of the Archduke succeeded in the end, but it opened\r\nGermany to the French for six weeks, and showed how worthless was the\r\nmilitary constitution of the Empire, and how little the Germans had to\r\nexpect from one another. After every skirmish won by Moreau some\r\nneighbouring State abandoned the common defence and hastened to make its\r\nterms with the invader. On the 17th of July the Duke of Würtemberg\r\npurchased an armistice at the price of four million francs; a week later\r\nBaden gained the French general's protection in return for immense supplies\r\nof food and stores. The troops of the Swabian Circle of the Empire, who\r\nwere ridiculed as \"harlequins\" by the more martial Austrians, dispersed to\r\ntheir homes; and no sooner had Moreau entered Bavaria than the Bavarian\r\ncontingent in its turn withdrew from the Archduke. Some consideration was\r\nshown by Moreau's soldiery to those districts which had paid tribute to\r\ntheir general; but in the region of the Main, Jourdan's army plundered\r\nwithout distinction and without mercy. They sacked the churches, they\r\nmaltreated the children, they robbed the very beggars of their pence.\r\nBefore the Archduke Charles was ready to strike, the peasantry of this\r\ncountry, whom their governments were afraid to arm, had begun effective\r\nreprisals of their own. At length the retreating movement of the Austrians\r\nstopped. Leaving 30,000 men on the Lech to disguise his motions from\r\nMoreau, Charles turned suddenly northwards from Neuburg on the 17th August,\r\nmet Wartensleben at Amberg, and attacked Jourdan at this place with greatly\r\nsuperior numbers. Jourdan was defeated and driven back in confusion towards\r\nthe Rhine. The issue of the campaign was decided before Moreau heard of his\r\ncolleague's danger. It only remained for him to save his own army by a\r\nskilful retreat. Jourdan's soldiers, returning through districts which they\r\nhad devastated, suffered heavier losses from the vengeance of the peasantry\r\nthan from the army that pursued them. By the autumn of 1796 no Frenchman\r\nremained beyond the Rhine. The campaign had restored the military spirit of\r\nAustria and given Germany a general in whom soldiers could trust; but it\r\nhad also shown how willing were the Governments of the minor States to\r\nbecome the vassals of a foreigner, how little was wanting to convert the\r\nwestern half of the Empire into a dependency of France.\r\n\r\n[Secret Treaty with Prussia, Aug. 5.]\r\n\r\nWith each change in the fortunes of the campaign of 1796 the diplomacy of\r\nthe Continent had changed its tone. When Moreau won his first victories,\r\nthe Court of Prussia, yielding to the pressure of the Directory,\r\nsubstituted for the conditional clauses of the Treaty of Basle a definite\r\nagreement to the cession of the left bank of the Rhine, and a stipulation\r\nthat Prussia should be compensated for her own loss by the annexation of\r\nthe Bishopric of Münster. Prussia could not itself cede provinces of the\r\nEmpire: it could only agree to their cession. In this treaty, however,\r\nPrussia definitely renounced the integrity of the Empire, and accepted the\r\nsystem known as the Secularisation of Ecclesiastical States, the first step\r\ntowards an entire reconstruction of Germany. [52] The engagement was kept\r\nsecret both from the Emperor and from the ecclesiastical princes. In their\r\nnegotiations with Austria the Directory were less successful. Although the\r\nlong series of Austrian disasters had raised a general outcry against\r\nThugut's persistence in the war, the resolute spirit of the Minister never\r\nbent; and the ultimate victory of the Archduke Charles more than restored\r\nhis influence over the Emperor. Austria refused to enter into any\r\nnegotiation not conducted in common with England, and the Directory were\r\nfor the present foiled in their attempts to isolate England from the\r\nContinental Powers. It was not that Thugut either hoped or cared for that\r\nrestoration of Austrian rule in the Netherlands which was the first object\r\nof England's Continental policy. The abandonment of the Netherlands by\r\nFrance was, however, in his opinion necessary for Austria, as a step\r\ntowards the acquisition of Bavaria, which was still the cherished hope of\r\nthe Viennese Government. It was in vain that the Directory suggested that\r\nAustria should annex Bavaria without offering Belgium or any other\r\ncompensation to its ruler. Thugut could hardly be induced to listen to the\r\nFrench overtures. He had received the promise of immediate help from the\r\nEmpress Catherine; he was convinced that the Republic, already anxious for\r\npeace, might by one sustained effort be forced to abandon all its\r\nconquests; and this was the object for which, in the winter of 1796, army\r\nafter army was hurled against the positions where Bonaparte kept his guard\r\non the north of the still unconquered Mantua. [53]\r\n\r\n[Malmesbury sent to Paris, Oct., 1796.]\r\n\r\nIn England itself the victory of the Archduke Charles raised expectations\r\nof peace. The war had become unpopular through the loss of trade with\r\nFrance, Spain, and Holland, and petitions for peace daily reached\r\nParliament. Pitt so far yielded to the prevalent feeling as to enter into\r\nnegotiations with the Directory, and despatched Lord Malmesbury to Paris;\r\nbut the condition upon which Pitt insisted, the restoration of the\r\nNetherlands to Austria, rendered agreement hopeless; and as soon as Pitt's\r\nterms were known to the Directory, Malmesbury was ordered to leave Paris.\r\nNevertheless, the negotiation was not a mere feint on Pitt's part. He was\r\npossessed by a fixed idea that the resources of France were exhausted, and\r\nthat, in spite of the conquest of Lombardy and the Rhine, the Republic must\r\nfeel itself too weak to continue the war. Amid the disorders of\r\nRevolutionary finance, and exaggerated reports of suffering and distress,\r\nPitt failed to recognise the enormous increase of production resulting from\r\nthe changes which had given the peasant full property in his land and\r\nlabour, and thrown vast quantities of half-waste domain into the busy hands\r\nof middling and small proprietors. [54]\r\n\r\nWhatever were the resources of France before the Revolution, they were now\r\nprobably more than doubled. Pitt's belief in the economic ruin of France,\r\nthe only ground on which he could imagine that the Directory would give up\r\nBelgium without fighting for it, was wholly erroneous, and the French\r\nGovernment would have acted strangely if they had listened to his demand.\r\n\r\n[Bonaparte creates a Cispadane Republic, Oct., 1796.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, though the Directory would not hear of surrendering Belgium,\r\nthey were anxious to conclude peace with Austria, and unwilling to enter\r\ninto any engagements in the conquered provinces of Italy which might render\r\npeace with Austria more difficult. They had instructed Bonaparte to stir up\r\nthe Italians against their Governments, but this was done with the object\r\nof paralysing the Governments, not of emancipating the peoples. They looked\r\nwith dislike upon any scheme of Italian reconstruction which should bind\r\nFrance to the support of newly-formed Italian States. Here, however, the\r\nscruples of the Directory and the ambition of Bonaparte were in direct\r\nconflict. Bonaparte intended to create a political system in Italy which\r\nshould bear the stamp of his own mind and require his own strong hand to\r\nsupport it. In one of his despatches to the Directory he suggested the\r\nformation of a client Republic out of the Duchy of Modena, where\r\nrevolutionary movements had broken out. Before it was possible for the\r\nGovernment to answer him, he published a decree, declaring the population\r\nof Modena and Reggio under the protection of the French army, and deposing\r\nall the officers of the Duke (Oct. 4). When, some days later, the answer of\r\nthe Directory arrived, it cautioned Bonaparte against disturbing the\r\nexisting order of the Italian States. Bonaparte replied by uniting to\r\nModena the Papal provinces of Bologna and Ferrara, and by giving to the\r\nState which he had thus created the title of the Cispadane Republic. [55]\r\n\r\n[Idea of free Italy.]\r\n\r\nThe event was no insignificant one. It is from this time that the idea of\r\nItalian independence, though foreign to the great mass of the nation, may\r\nbe said to have taken birth as one of those political hopes which wane and\r\nrecede, but do not again leave the world. A class of men who had turned\r\nwith dislike from the earlier agitation of French Republicans in Italy\r\nrightly judged the continued victories of Bonaparte over the Austrians to\r\nbe the beginning of a series of great changes, and now joined the\r\nrevolutionary movement in the hope of winning from the overthrow of the old\r\nPowers some real form of national independence. In its origin the French\r\nparty may have been composed of hirelings and enthusiasts. This ceased to\r\nbe the case when, after the passage of the Mincio, Bonaparte entered the\r\nPapal States. Among the citizens of Bologna in particular there were men of\r\nweight and intelligence who aimed at free constitutional government, and\r\nchecked in some degree the more numerous popular party which merely\r\nrepeated the phrases of French democracy. Bonaparte's own language and\r\naction excited the brightest hopes. At Modena he harangued the citizens\r\nupon the mischief of Italy's divisions, and exhorted them to unite with\r\ntheir brethren whom he had freed from the Pope. A Congress was held at\r\nModena on the 16th of October. The representatives of Modena, Reggio,\r\nBologna, and Ferrara declared themselves united in a Republic under the\r\nprotection of France. They abolished feudal nobility, decreed a national\r\nlevy, and summoned a General Assembly to meet at Reggio two months later,\r\nin order to create the Constitution of the new Cispadane Republic. It was\r\nin the Congress of Modena, and in the subsequent Assembly of Reggio (Dec.\r\n23), that the idea of Italian unity and independence first awoke the\r\nenthusiasm of any considerable body of men. With what degree of sincerity\r\nBonaparte himself acted may be judged from the circumstance that, while he\r\nharangued the Cispadanes on the necessity of Italian union, he imprisoned\r\nthe Milanese who attempted to excite a popular movement for the purpose of\r\nextending this union to themselves. Peace was not yet made with Austria,\r\nand it was uncertain to what account Milan might best be turned.\r\n\r\n[Rivoli, Jan. 14, 15, 1797.]\r\n\r\n[Arcola, Nov. 15-17.]\r\n\r\nMantua still held out, and in November the relieving operations of the\r\nAustrians were renewed. Two armies, commanded by Allvintzy and Davidovich,\r\ndescended the valleys of the Adige and the Piave, offering to Bonaparte,\r\nwhose centre was at Verona, a new opportunity of crushing his enemy in\r\ndetail. Allvintzy, coming from the Piave, brought the French into extreme\r\ndanger in a three days' battle at Arcola, but was at last forced to retreat\r\nwith heavy loss. Davidovich, who had been successful on the Adige, retired\r\non learning the overthrow of his colleague. Two months more passed, and the\r\nAustrians for the third time appeared on the Adige. A feint made below\r\nVerona nearly succeeded in drawing Bonaparte away from Rivoli, between the\r\nAdige and Lake Garda, where Allvintzy and his main army were about to make\r\nthe assault; but the strength of Allvintzy's force was discovered before it\r\nwas too late, and by throwing his divisions from point to point with\r\nextraordinary rapidity, Bonaparte at length overwhelmed the Austrians in\r\nevery quarter of the battle-field. This was their last effort. The\r\nsurrender of Mantua on the 2nd February, 1797, completed the French\r\nconquest of Austrian Lombardy. [56]\r\n\r\n[Peace of Tolentino, Feb. 19, 1797.]\r\n\r\nThe Pope now found himself left to settle his account with the invaders,\r\nagainst whom, even after the armistice, he had never ceased to intrigue.\r\n[57] His despatches to Vienna fell into the hands of Bonaparte, who\r\ndeclared the truce broken, and a second time invaded the Papal territory. A\r\nshow of resistance was made by the Roman troops; but the country was in\r\nfact at the mercy of Bonaparte, who advanced as far as Tolentino, thirty\r\nmiles south of Ancona. Here the Pope tendered his submission. If the Roman\r\nCourt had never appeared to be in a more desperate condition, it had never\r\nfound a more moderate or a more politic conqueror. Bonaparte was as free\r\nfrom any sentiment of Christian piety as Nero or Diocletian; but he\r\nrespected the power of the Papacy over men's minds, and he understood the\r\nimmense advantage which any Government of France supported by the\r\npriesthood would possess over those who had to struggle with its hostility.\r\nIn his negotiations with the Papal envoys he deplored the violence of the\r\nFrench Executive, and consoled the Church with the promise of his own\r\nprotection and sympathy. The terms of peace which he granted, although they\r\ngreatly diminished the ecclesiastical territory were in fact more\r\nfavourable than the Pope had any right to expect. Bologna, Ferrara, and the\r\nRomagna, which had been occupied in virtue of the armistice, were now ceded\r\nby the Papacy. But conditions affecting the exercise of the spiritual power\r\nwhich had been proposed by the Directory were withdrawn; and, beyond a\r\nprovision for certain payments in money, nothing of importance was added to\r\nthe stipulations of the armistice.\r\n\r\nThe last days of the Venetian Republic were now at hand. It was in vain\r\nthat Venice had maintained its neutrality when all the rest of Italy joined\r\nthe enemies of France; its refusal of a French alliance was made an\r\nunpardonable crime. So long as the war with Austria lasted, Bonaparte\r\nexhausted the Venetian territory with requisitions: when peace came within\r\nview, it was necessary that he should have some pretext for seizing it or\r\nhanding it over to the enemy. In fulfilment of his own design of keeping a\r\nquarrel open, he had subjected the Government to every insult and wrong\r\nlikely to goad it into an act of war. When at length Venice armed for the\r\npurpose of protecting its neutrality, the organs of the invader called upon\r\nthe inhabitants of the Venetian mainland to rise against the oligarchy, and\r\nto throw in their lot with the liberated province of Milan. A French\r\nalliance was once more urged upon Venice by Bonaparte: it was refused, and\r\nthe outbreak which the French had prepared instantly followed. Bergamo and\r\nBrescia, where French garrisons deprived the Venetian Government of all\r\npower of defence, rose in revolt, and renounced all connection with Venice.\r\nThe Senate begged Bonaparte to withdraw the French garrisons; its\r\nentreaties drew nothing from him but repeated demands for the acceptance of\r\nthe French alliance, which was only another name for subjection. Little as\r\nthe Venetians suspected it, the only doubt now present to Bonaparte was\r\nwhether he should add the provinces of Venetia to his own Cispadane\r\nRepublic or hand them over to Austria in exchange for other cessions which\r\nFrance required.\r\n\r\n[Preliminaries of Leoben, April 18.]\r\n\r\nAustria could defend itself in Italy no longer. Before the end of March the\r\nmountain-passes into Carinthia were carried by Bonaparte. His army drove\r\nthe enemy before it along the road to Vienna, until both pursuers and\r\npursued were within eighty miles of the capital. At Leoben, on the 7th of\r\nApril, Austrian commander asked for a suspension of arms. It was granted,\r\nand negotiations for peace commenced. [58] Bonaparte offered the Venetian\r\nprovinces, but not the city of Venice, to the Emperor. On the 18th of April\r\npreliminaries of peace were signed at Leoben, by which, in return for the\r\nNetherlands and for Lombardy west of the river Oglio, Bonaparte secretly\r\nagreed to hand over to Austria the whole of the territory of Venice upon\r\nthe mainland east of the Oglio, in addition to its Adriatic provinces of\r\nIstria and Dalmatia. To disguise the act of spoliation, it was pretended\r\nthat Bologna and Ferrara should be offered to Venice in return. [59]\r\n\r\n[French enter Venice.]\r\n\r\nBut worse was yet to come. While Bonaparte was in conference at Leoben, an\r\noutbreak took place at Verona, and three hundred French soldiers, including\r\nthe sick in the hospital, perished by popular violence. The Venetian Senate\r\ndespatched envoys to Bonaparte to express their grief and to offer\r\nsatisfaction; in the midst of the negotiations intelligence arrived that\r\nthe commander of a Venetian fort had fired upon a French vessel and killed\r\nsome of the crew. Bonaparte drove the envoys from his presence, declaring\r\nthat he could not treat with men whose hands were dripping with French\r\nblood. A declaration of war was published, charging the Senate with the\r\ndesign of repeating the Sicilian Vespers, and the panic which it was\r\nBonaparte's object to inspire instantly followed. The Government threw\r\nthemselves upon his mercy. Bonaparte pretended that he desired no more than\r\nto establish a popular government in Venice in the place of the oligarchy.\r\nHis terms were accepted. The Senate consented to abrogate the ancient\r\nConstitution of the Republic, and to introduce a French garrison into\r\nVenice. On the 12th of May the Grand Council voted its own dissolution.\r\nPeace was concluded. The public articles of the treaty declared that there\r\nshould be friendship between the French and the Venetian Republics; that\r\nthe sovereignty of Venice should reside in the body of the citizens; and\r\nthat the French garrison should retire so soon as the new Government\r\nannounced that it had no further need of its support. Secret articles\r\nstipulated for a money payment, and for the usual surrender of works of\r\nart; an indefinite expression relating to an exchange of territory was\r\nintended to cover the surrender of the Venetian mainland, and the union of\r\nBologna and Ferrara with what remained of Venice. The friendship and\r\nalliance of France, which Bonaparte had been so anxious to bestow on\r\nVenice, were now to bear their fruit. \"I shall do everything in my power,\"\r\nhe wrote to the new Government of Venice, \"to give you proof of the great\r\ndesire I have to see your liberty take root, and to see this unhappy Italy,\r\nfreed from the rule of the stranger, at length take its place with glory on\r\nthe scene of the world, and resume, among the great nations, the rank to\r\nwhich nature, destiny, and its own position call it.\" This was for Venice;\r\nfor the French Directory Bonaparte had a very different tale. \"I had\r\nseveral motives,\" he wrote (May 19), \"in concluding the treaty:--to enter\r\nthe city without difficulty; to have the arsenal and all else in our\r\npossession, in order to take from it whatever we needed, under pretext of\r\nthe secret articles; ... to evade the odium attaching to the Preliminaries\r\nof Leoben; to furnish pretexts for them, and to facilitate their\r\nexecution.\"\r\n\r\n[French seize Ionian islands.]\r\n\r\n[Venice to be given to Austria.]\r\n\r\nAs the first fruits of the Venetian alliance, Bonaparte seized upon Corfu\r\nand the other Ionian Islands. \"You will start,\" he wrote to General\r\nGentili, \"as quickly and as secretly as possible, and take possession of\r\nall the Venetian establishments in the Levant.... If the inhabitants\r\nshould be inclined for independence, you should flatter their tastes, and\r\nin all your proclamations you should not fail to allude to Greece, Athens,\r\nand Sparta.\" This was to be the French share in the spoil. Yet even now,\r\nthough stripped of its islands, its coasts, and its ancient Italian\r\nterritory, Venice might still have remained a prominent city in Italy. It\r\nwas sacrificed in order to gain the Rhenish Provinces for France. Bonaparte\r\nhad returned to the neighbourhood of Milan, and received the Austrian\r\nenvoy, De Gallo, at the villa of Montebello. Wresting a forced meaning from\r\nthe Preliminaries of Leoben, Bonaparte claimed the frontier of the Rhine,\r\noffering to Austria not only the territory of Venice upon the mainland, but\r\nthe city of Venice itself. De Gallo yielded. Whatever causes subsequently\r\nprolonged the negotiation, no trace of honour or pity in Bonaparte led him\r\neven to feign a reluctance to betray Venice. \"We have to-day had our first\r\nconference on the definitive treaty,\" he wrote to the Directory, on the\r\nnight of the 26th of May, \"and have agreed to present the following\r\npropositions: the line of the Rhine for France; Salzburg, Passau for the\r\nEmperor; ... the maintenance of the Germanic Body; ... Venice for the\r\nEmperor. Venice,\" he continued, \"which has been in decadence since the\r\ndiscovery of the Cape of Good Hope and the rise of Trieste and Ancona, can\r\nscarcely survive the blows we have just struck. With a cowardly and\r\nhelpless population in no way fit for liberty, without territory and\r\nwithout rivers, it is but natural that she should go to those to whom we\r\ngive the mainland.\" Thus was Italy to be freed from foreign intervention;\r\nand thus was Venice to be regenerated by the friendship of France!\r\n\r\n[Genoa.]\r\n\r\nIn comparison with the fate preparing for Venice, the sister-republic of\r\nGenoa met with generous treatment. A revolutionary movement, long prepared\r\nby the French envoy, overthrew the ancient oligarchical Government; but\r\ndemocratic opinion and French sympathies did not extend below the middle\r\nclasses of the population; and, after the Government had abandoned its own\r\ncause, the charcoal-burners and dock-labourers rose in its defence, and\r\nattacked the French party with the cry of \"Viva Maria,\" and with figures of\r\nthe Virgin fastened to their hats, in the place where their opponents wore\r\nthe French tricolour. Religious fanaticism won the day; the old Government\r\nwas restored, and a number of Frenchmen who had taken part in the conflict\r\nwere thrown into prison. The imprisonment of the Frenchmen gave Bonaparte a\r\npretext for intervention. He disclaimed all desire to alter the Government,\r\nand demanded only the liberation of his countrymen and the arrest of the\r\nenemies of France. But the overthrow of the oligarchy had been long\r\narranged with Faypoult, the French envoy; and Genoa received a democratic\r\nconstitution which place the friends of France in power (June 5).\r\n\r\n[France in 1797.]\r\n\r\nWhile Bonaparte, holding Court in the Villa of Montebello, continued to\r\nnegotiate with Austria upon the basis of the Preliminaries of Leoben,\r\nevents took place in France which offered him an opportunity of interfering\r\ndirectly in the government of the Republic. The elections which were to\r\nreplace one-third of the members of the Legislature took place in the\r\nspring of 1797. The feeling of the country was now much the same as it had\r\nbeen in 1795, when a large Royalist element was returned for those seats in\r\nthe Councils which the Convention had not reserved for its own members.\r\nFrance desired a more equitable and a more tolerant rule. The Directory had\r\nindeed allowed the sanguinary laws against non-juring priests and returning\r\nemigrants to remain unenforced; but the spirit and traditions of official\r\nJacobinism were still active in the Government. The Directors themselves\r\nwere all regicides; the execution of the King was still celebrated by a\r\nnational _fête_; offices, great and small, were held by men who had risen\r\nin the Revolution; the whole of the old gentry of France was excluded from\r\nparticipation in public life. It was against this revolutionary class-rule,\r\nagainst a system which placed the country as much at the mercy of a few\r\ndirectors and generals as it had been at the mercy of the Conventional\r\nCommittee, that the elections of 1797 were a protest. Along with certain\r\nBourbonist conspirators, a large majority of men were returned who, though\r\ndescribed as Royalists, were in fact moderate Constitutionalists, and\r\ndesired only to undo that part of the Revolution which excluded whole\r\nclasses of the nation from public life. [60]\r\n\r\n[Opposition to the Directory.]\r\n\r\nSuch a party in the legislative body naturally took the character of an\r\nOpposition to the more violent section of the Directory. The Director\r\nretiring in 1797 was replaced by the Constitutionalist Barthélemy,\r\nnegotiator of the treaty of Basle; Carnot, who continued in office, took\r\npart with the Opposition, justly fearing that the rule of the Directory\r\nwould soon amount to nothing more than the rule of Bonaparte himself. The\r\nfirst debates in the new Chamber arose upon the laws relating to emigrants;\r\nthe next, upon Bonaparte's usurpation of sovereign power in Italy. On the\r\n23rd of June a motion for information on the affairs of Venice and Genoa\r\nwas brought forward in the Council of Five Hundred. Dumolard, the mover,\r\ncomplained of the secrecy of Bonaparte's action, of the contempt shown by\r\nhim to the Assembly, of his tyrannical and un-republican interference with\r\nthe institutions of friendly States. No resolution was adopted by the\r\nAssembly; but the mere fact that the Assembly had listened to a hostile\r\ncriticism of his own actions was sufficient ground in Bonaparte's eyes to\r\ncharge it with Royalism and with treason. Three of the Directors, Barras,\r\nRewbell, and Laréveillère, had already formed the project of overpowering\r\nthe Assembly by force. Bonaparte's own interests led him to offer them his\r\nsupport. If the Constitutional party gained power, there was an end to his\r\nown unshackled rule in Italy; if the Bourbonists succeeded, a different\r\nclass of men would hold all the honours of the State. However feeble the\r\nGovernment of the Directory, its continuance secured his own present\r\nascendency, and left him the hope of gaining supreme power when the public\r\ncould tolerate the Directory no longer.\r\n\r\n[Coup d'état, 17 Fructidor (Sept. 3).]\r\n\r\nThe fate of the Assembly was sealed. On the anniversary of the capture of\r\nthe Bastille, Bonaparte issued a proclamation to his army declaring the\r\nRepublic to be threatened by Royalist intrigues. A banquet was held, and\r\nthe officers and soldiers of every division signed addresses to the\r\nDirectory full of threats and fury against conspiring aristocrats.\r\n\"Indignation is at its height in the army,\" wrote Bonaparte to the\r\nGovernment; \"the soldiers are asking with loud cries whether they are to be\r\nrewarded by assassination on their return home, as it appears all patriots\r\nare to be so dealt with. The peril is increasing every day, and I think,\r\ncitizen Directors, you must decide to act one way or other.\" The Directors\r\nhad no difficulty in deciding after such an exhortation as this; but, as\r\nsoon as Bonaparte had worked up their courage, he withdrew into the\r\nbackground, and sent General Augereau, a blustering Jacobin, to Paris, to\r\nrisk the failure or bear the odium of the crime. Augereau received the\r\nmilitary command of the capital; the air was filled with rumours of an\r\nimpending blow; but neither the majority in the Councils nor the two\r\nthreatened Directors, Carnot and Barthélemy, knew how to take measures of\r\ndefence. On the night of the 3rd September (17 Fructidor) the troops of\r\nAugereau surrounded the Tuileries. Barthélemy was seized at the Luxembourg;\r\nCarnot fled for his life; the members of the Councils, marching in\r\nprocession to the Tuileries early the next morning, were arrested or\r\ndispersed by the soldiers. Later in the day a minority of the Councils was\r\nassembled to ratify the measures determined upon by Augereau and the three\r\nDirectors. Fifty members of the Legislature, and the writers, proprietors,\r\nand editors of forty-two journals, were sentenced to exile; the elections\r\nof forty-eight departments were annulled; the laws against priests and\r\nemigrants were renewed; and the Directory was empowered to suppress all\r\njournals at its pleasure. This coup d'état was described as the suppression\r\nof a Royalist conspiracy. It was this, but it was something more. It was\r\nthe suppression of all Constitutional government, and all but the last step\r\nto the despotism of the chief of the army.\r\n\r\n[Peace signed with Austria, Oct. 17.]\r\n\r\nThe effect of the movement was instantly felt in the negotiations with\r\nAustria and with England. Lord Malmesbury was now again in France, treating\r\nfor peace with fair hopes of success, since the Preliminaries of Leoben had\r\nremoved England's opposition to the cession of the Netherlands, the\r\ndiscomfiture of the moderate party in the Councils brought his mission to\r\nan abrupt end. Austria, on the other hand, had prolonged its negotiations\r\nbecause Bonaparte claimed Mantua and the Rhenish Provinces in addition to\r\nthe cessions agreed upon at Leoben. Count Ludwig Cobenzl, Austrian\r\nambassador at St. Petersburg, who had protected his master's interests only\r\ntoo well in the last partition of Poland, was now at the head of the\r\nplenipotentiaries in Italy, endeavouring to bring Bonaparte back to the\r\nterms fixed in the Preliminaries, or to gain additional territory for\r\nAustria in Italy. The Jacobin victory at Paris depressed the Austrians as\r\nmuch as it elated the French leader. Bonaparte was resolved on concluding a\r\npeace that should be all his own, and this was only possible by\r\nanticipating an invasion of Germany, about to be undertaken by Augereau at\r\nthe head of the Army of the Rhine. It was to this personal ambition of\r\nBonaparte that Venice was sacrificed. The Directors were willing that\r\nAustria should receive part of the Venetian territory: they forbade the\r\nproposed cession of Venice itself. Within a few weeks more, the advance of\r\nthe Army of the Rhine would have enabled France to dictate its own terms;\r\nbut no consideration either for France or for Italy could induce Bonaparte\r\nto share the glory of the Peace with another. On the 17th of October he\r\nsigned the final treaty of Campo Formio, which gave France the frontier of\r\nthe Rhine, and made both the Venetian territory beyond the Adige and Venice\r\nitself the property of the Emperor. For a moment it seemed that the Treaty\r\nmight be repudiated at Vienna as well as at Paris. Thugut protested against\r\nit, because it surrendered Mantua and the Rhenish Provinces without gaining\r\nfor Austria the Papal Legations; and he drew up the ratification only at\r\nthe absolute command of the Emperor. The Directory, on the other hand,\r\ncondemned the cession of Venice. But their fear of Bonaparte and their own\r\nbad conscience left them impotent accessories of his treachery; and the\r\nFrench nation at large was too delighted with the peace to resent its baser\r\nconditions. [61]\r\n\r\n[Treaty of Campo Formio, Oct. 17.]\r\n\r\nBy the public articles of the Treaty of Campo Formio, the Emperor ceded to\r\nFrance the Austrian possessions in Lombardy and in the Netherlands, and\r\nagreed to the establishment of a Cisalpine Republic, formed out of Austrian\r\nLombardy, the Venetian territory west of the Adige, and the districts\r\nhitherto composing the new Cispadane State. France took the Ionian Islands,\r\nAustria the City of Venice, with Istria and Dalmatia, and the Venetian\r\nmainland east of the Adige. For the conclusion of peace between France and\r\nthe Holy Roman Empire, it was agreed that a Congress should meet at\r\nRastadt; but a secret article provided that the Emperor should use his\r\nefforts to gain for France the whole left bank of the Rhine, except a tract\r\nincluding the Prussian Duchies of Cleve and Guelders. With humorous\r\nduplicity the French Government, which had promised Prussia the Bishopric\r\nof Münster in return for this very district, now pledged itself to Austria\r\nthat Prussia should receive no extension whatever, and affected to exclude\r\nthe Prussian Duchies from the Rhenish territory which was to be made over\r\nto France. Austria was promised the independent Bishopric of Salzburg, and\r\nthat portion of Bavaria which lies between the Inn and the Salza. The\r\nsecular princes dispossessed in the Rhenish Provinces were to be\r\ncompensated in the interior of the Empire by a scheme framed in concert\r\nwith France.\r\n\r\n[Austria sacrifices Germany.]\r\n\r\nThe immense advantages which the Treaty of Campo Formio gave to France--its\r\nextension over the Netherlands and the Rhenish Provinces, and the virtual\r\nannexation of Lombardy, Modena, and the Papal Legations under the form of a\r\nclient republic--were not out of proportion to its splendid military\r\nsuccesses. Far otherwise was it with Austria. With the exception of the\r\nArchduke's campaign of 1796, the warfare of the last three years had\r\nbrought Austria nothing but a series of disasters; yet Austria gained by\r\nthe Treaty of Campo Formio as much as it lost. In the place of the distant\r\nNetherlands and of Milan it gained, in Venice and Dalmatia, a territory\r\ntouching its own, nearly equal to the Netherlands and Milan together in\r\npopulation, and so situated as to enable Austria to become one of the naval\r\nPowers of the Mediterranean. The price which Austria paid was the\r\nabandonment of Germany, a matter which, in spite of Thugut's protests,\r\ndisturbed the Court of Vienna as little as the betrayal of Venice disturbed\r\nBonaparte. The Rhenish Provinces were surrendered to the stranger; German\r\ndistricts were to be handed over to compensate the ejected Sovereigns of\r\nHolland and of Modena; the internal condition and order of the Empire were\r\nto be superseded by one framed not for the purpose of benefiting Germany,\r\nbut for the purpose of extending the influence of France.\r\n\r\n[Policy of Bonaparte.]\r\n\r\nAs defenders of Germany, both Prussia and Austria had been found wanting.\r\nThe latter Power seemed to have reaped in Italy the reward of its firmness\r\nin prolonging the war. Bonaparte ridiculed the men who, in the earlier\r\nspirit of the Revolution, desired to found a freer political system in\r\nEurope upon the ruins of Austria's power. \"I have not drawn my support in\r\nItaly,\" he wrote to Talleyrand (Oct. 7), \"from the love of the peoples for\r\nliberty and equality, or at least but a very feeble support. The real\r\nsupport of the army of Italy has been its own discipline, ... above all,\r\nour promptitude in repressing malcontents and punishing those who declared\r\nagainst us. This is history; what I say in my proclamations and speeches is\r\na romance.... If we return to the foreign policy of 1793, we shall do so\r\nknowing that a different policy has brought us success, and that we have no\r\nlonger the great masses of 1793 to enrol in our armies, nor the support of\r\nan enthusiasm which has its day and does not return.\" Austria might well,\r\nfor the present, be left in some strength, and France was fortunate to have\r\nso dangerous an enemy off her hands. England required the whole forces of\r\nthe Republic. \"The present situation,\" wrote Bonaparte, after the Peace of\r\nCampo Formio, \"offers us a good chance. We must set all our strength upon\r\nthe sea; we must destroy England; and the Continent is at our feet.\"\r\n\r\n[Battles of St. Vincent, Feb. 14, 1797, and Camperdown, Oct. 6.]\r\n\r\nIt had been the natural hope of the earlier Republicans that the Spanish\r\nand the Dutch navies, if they could be brought to the side of France, would\r\nmake France superior to Great Britain as a maritime Power. The conquest of\r\nHolland had been planned by Carnot as the first step towards an invasion of\r\nEngland. For a while these plans seemed to be approaching their fulfilment,\r\nHolland was won; Spain first made peace, and then entered into alliance\r\nwith the Directory (Aug. 1796). But each increase in the naval forces of\r\nthe Republic only gave the admirals of Great Britain new material to\r\ndestroy. The Spanish fleet was beaten by Jarvis off St. Vincent; even the\r\nmutiny of the British squadrons at Spithead and the Nore, in the spring and\r\nsummer of 1797, caused no change in the naval situation in the North Sea.\r\nDuncan, who was blockading the Dutch fleet in the Texel when his own\r\nsquadron joined the mutineers, continued the blockade with one ship beside\r\nhis own, signalling all the while as if the whole fleet were at his back;\r\nuntil the misused seamen, who had lately turned their guns upon the Thames,\r\nreturned to the admiral, and earned his forgiveness by destroying the Dutch\r\nat Camperdown as soon as they ventured out of shelter.\r\n\r\n[Bonaparte about to invade Egypt.]\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether at any time after his return from Italy Bonaparte\r\nseriously entertained the project of invading England. The plan was at any\r\nrate soon abandoned, and the preparations, which caused great alarm in the\r\nEnglish coast-towns, were continued only for the purpose of disguising\r\nBonaparte's real design of an attack upon Egypt. From the beginning of his\r\ncareer Bonaparte's thoughts had turned towards the vast and undefended\r\nEast. While still little known, he had asked the French Government to send\r\nhim to Constantinople to organise the Turkish army; as soon as Venice fell\r\ninto his hands, he had seized the Ionian Islands as the base for a future\r\nconquest of the Levant. Every engagement that confirmed the superiority of\r\nEngland upon the western seas gave additional reason for attacking her\r\nwhere her power was most precarious, in the East. Bonaparte knew that\r\nAlexander had conquered the country of the Indus by a land-march from the\r\nMediterranean, and this was perhaps all the information which he possessed\r\nregarding the approaches to India; but it was enough to fix his mind upon\r\nthe conquest of Egypt and Syria, as the first step towards the destruction\r\nof the Asiatic Empire of England. Mingled with the design upon India was a\r\ndream of overthrowing the Mohammedan Government of Turkey, and attacking\r\nAustria from the East with an army drawn from the liberated Christian races\r\nof the Ottoman Empire. The very vagueness of a scheme of Eastern conquest\r\nmade it the more attractive to Bonaparte's genius and ambition. Nor was\r\nthere any inclination on the part of the Government to detain the general\r\nat home. The Directory, little concerned with the real merits or dangers of\r\nthe enterprise, consented to Bonaparte's project of an attack upon Egypt,\r\nthankful for any opportunity of loosening the grasp which was now closing\r\nso firmly upon themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nCongress of Rastadt--The Rhenish Provinces ceded--Ecclesiastical States of\r\nGermany suppressed--French intervention in Switzerland--Helvetic Republic--\r\nThe French invade the Papal States--Roman Republic--Expedition to Egypt--\r\nBattle of the Nile--Coalition of 1798--Ferdinand of Naples enters\r\nRome--Mack's defeats--French enter Naples--Parthenopean Republic--War with\r\nAustria and Russia--Battle of Stockach--Murder of the French Envoys at\r\nRastadt--Campaign in Lombardy--Reign of Terror at Naples--Austrian designs\r\nupon Italy--Suvaroff and the Austrians--Campaign in Switzerland--Campaign\r\nin Holland--Bonaparte returns from Egypt--Coup d'état of 18 Brumaire--\r\nConstitution of 1799--System of Bonaparte in France--Its effect on the\r\ninfluence of France abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Congress of Rastadt, Nov. 1797.]\r\n\r\nThe public articles of the Treaty of Campo Formio contained only the terms\r\nwhich had been agreed upon by France and Austria in relation to Italy and\r\nthe Netherlands: the conditions of peace between France and the Germanic\r\nBody, which had been secretly arranged between France and the two leading\r\nPowers, were referred by a diplomatic fiction to a Congress that was to\r\nassemble at Rastadt. Accordingly, after Prussia and Austria had each signed\r\nan agreement abandoning the Rhenish Provinces, the Congress was duly\r\nsummoned. As if in mockery of his helpless countrymen, the Emperor informed\r\nthe members of the Diet that \"in unshaken fidelity to the great principle\r\nof the unity and indivisibility of the German Empire, they were to maintain\r\nthe common interests of the Fatherland with noble conscientiousness and\r\nGerman steadfastness; and so, united with their imperial head, to promote a\r\njust and lasting peace, founded upon the basis of the integrity of the\r\nEmpire and of its Constitution.\" [62] Thus the Congress was convoked upon\r\nthe pretence of preserving what the two greater States had determined to\r\nsacrifice; while its real object, the suppression of the ecclesiastical\r\nprincipalities and the curtailment of Bavaria, was studiously put out of\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n[Rivalry of the Germans.]\r\n\r\nThe Congress was composed of two French envoys, of the representatives of\r\nPrussia and Austria, and of a committee, numbering with their secretaries\r\nseventy-four persons, appointed by the Diet of Ratisbon. But the recognised\r\nnegotiators formed only a small part of the diplomatists who flocked to\r\nRastadt in the hope of picking up something from the wreck of the Empire.\r\nEvery petty German sovereign, even communities which possessed no political\r\nrights at all, thought it necessary to have an agent on the spot, in order\r\nto filch, if possible, some trifling advantage from a neighbour, or to\r\ncatch the first rumour of a proposed annexation. It was the saturnalia of\r\nthe whole tribe of busybodies and intriguers who passed in Germany for men\r\nof state. They spied upon one another; they bribed the secretaries and\r\ndoorkeepers, they bribed the very cooks and coachmen, of the two omnipotent\r\nFrench envoys. Of the national humiliation of Germany, of the dishonour\r\nattaching to the loss of entire provinces and the reorganisation of what\r\nremained at the bidding of the stranger, there seems to have been no sense\r\nin the political circles of the day. The collapse of the Empire was viewed\r\nrather as a subject of merriment. A gaiety of life and language prevailed,\r\nimpossible among men who did not consider themselves as the spectators of a\r\ncomedy. Cobenzl, the chief Austrian plenipotentiary, took his travels in a\r\nfly, because his mistress, the _citoyenne_ Hyacinthe, had decamped with all\r\nhis carriages and horses. A witty but profane pamphlet was circulated, in\r\nwhich the impending sacrifice of the Empire was described in language\r\nborrowed from the Gospel narrative, Prussia taking the part of Judas\r\nIscariot, Austria that of Pontius Pilate, the Congress itself being the\r\nchief priests and Pharisees assembling that they may take the Holy Roman\r\nEmpire by craft, while the army of the Empire figures as the \"multitude who\r\nsmote upon their breasts and departed.\" In the utter absence of any German\r\npride or patriotism the French envoys not only obtained the territory that\r\nthey required, but successfully embroiled the two leading Powers with one\r\nanother, and accustomed the minor States to look to France for their own\r\npromotion at the cost of their neighbours. The contradictory pledges which\r\nthe French Government had given to Austria and to Prussia caused it no\r\nembarrassment. To deceive one of the two powers was to win the gratitude of\r\nthe other; and the Directory determined to fulfil its engagement to Prussia\r\nat the expense of the bishoprics, and to ignore what it had promised to\r\nAustria at the expense of Bavaria.\r\n\r\n[Rhenish Provinces.]\r\n\r\n[Ecclesiastical States suppressed.]\r\n\r\nA momentary difficulty arose upon the opening of the Congress, when it\r\nappeared that, misled by the Emperor's protestations, the Diet had only\r\nempowered its Committee to treat upon the basis of the integrity of the\r\nEmpire (Dec. 9). The French declined to negotiate until the Committee had\r\nprocured full powers: and the prospects of the integrity of the Empire were\r\nmade clear enough a few days later by the entry of the French into Mainz,\r\nand the formal organisation of the Rhenish Provinces as four French\r\nDepartments. In due course a decree of the Diet arrived, empowering the\r\nCommittee to negotiate at their discretion: and for some weeks after the\r\ninhabitants of the Rhenish Provinces had been subjected to the laws, the\r\nmagistracy, and the taxation of France, the Committee deliberated upon the\r\nproposal for their cession with as much minuteness and as much impartiality\r\nas if it had been a point of speculative philosophy. At length the French\r\nput an end to the tedious trifling, and proceeded to the question of\r\ncompensation for the dispossessed lay Princes. This they proposed to effect\r\nby means of the disestablishment, or secularisation, of ecclesiastical\r\nStates in the interior of Germany. Prussia eagerly supported the French\r\nproposal, both with a view to the annexation of the great Bishopric of\r\nMünster, and from ancient hostility to the ecclesiastical States as\r\ninstruments and allies of Catholic Austria. The Emperor opposed the\r\ndestruction of his faithful dependents; the ecclesiastical princes\r\nthemselves raised a bitter outcry, and demonstrated that the fall of their\r\norder would unloose the keystone of the political system of Europe; but\r\nthey found few friends. If Prussia coveted the great spoils of Münster, the\r\nminor sovereigns, as a rule, wore just as eager for the convents and abbeys\r\nthat broke the continuity of their own territories: only the feeblest of\r\nall the members of the Empire, the counts, the knights, and the cities,\r\nfelt a respectful sympathy for their ecclesiastical neighbours, and foresaw\r\nthat in a system of annexation their own turn would come next. The\r\nprinciple of secularisation was accepted by the Congress without much\r\ndifficulty, all the energy of debate being reserved for the discussion of\r\ndetails: arrangements which were to transfer a few miles of ground and half\r\na dozen custom-houses from some bankrupt ecclesiastic to some French-bought\r\nduke excited more interest in Germany than the loss of the Rhenish\r\nProvinces, and the subjection of a tenth part of the German nation to a\r\nforeign rule.\r\n\r\n[Austria determines on war, 1798.]\r\n\r\nOne more question was unexpectedly presented to the Congress. After\r\nproclaiming for six years that the Rhine was the natural boundary of\r\nFrance, the French Government discovered that a river cannot be a military\r\nfrontier at all. Of what service, urged the French plenipotentiaries, were\r\nStrasburg and Mainz, so long as they were commanded by the guns on the\r\nopposite bank? If the Rhine was to be of any use to France, France must be\r\nput in possession of the fortresses of Kehl and Castel upon the German\r\nside. Outrageous as such a demand appears, it found supporters among the\r\nvenal politicians of the smaller Courts, and furnished the Committee with\r\nmaterial for arguments that extended over four months. But the policy of\r\nAustria was now taking a direction that rendered the resolutions of the\r\nCongress of very little importance. It had become clear that France was\r\ninclining to an alliance with Prussia, and that the Bavarian annexations\r\npromised to Austria by the secret articles of Campo Formio were to be\r\nwithheld. Once convinced, by the failure of a private negotiation in\r\nAlsace, that the French would neither be content with their gains of 1797,\r\nnor permit Austria to extend its territory in Italy, Thugut determined upon\r\na renewal of the war. [63] In spite of a powerful opposition at Court,\r\nThugut's stubborn will still controlled the fortune of Austria: and the\r\naggressions of the French Republic in Switzerland and the Papal States, at\r\nthe moment when it was dictating terms of peace to the Empire, gave only\r\ntoo much cause for the formation of a new European league.\r\n\r\n[French intervention in Switzerland.]\r\n\r\nAt the close of the last century there was no country where the spirit of\r\nRepublican freedom was so strong, or where the conditions of life were so\r\nlevel, as in Switzerland; its inhabitants, however, were far from enjoying\r\ncomplete political equality. There were districts which stood in the\r\nrelation of subject dependencies to one or other of the ruling cantons: the\r\nPays de Vaud was governed by an officer from Berne; the valley of the\r\nTicino belonged to Uri; and in most of the sovereign cantons themselves\r\nauthority was vested in a close circle of patrician families. Thus,\r\nalthough Switzerland was free from the more oppressive distinctions of\r\ncaste, and the Governments, even where not democratic, were usually just\r\nand temperate, a sufficiently large class was excluded from political\r\nrights to give scope to an agitation which received its impulse from Paris.\r\nIt was indeed among communities advanced in comfort and intelligence, and\r\ndivided from those who governed them by no great barrier of wealth and\r\nprestige, that the doctrines of the Revolution found a circulation which\r\nthey could never gain among the hereditary serfs of Prussia or the\r\npriest-ridden peasantry of the Roman States. As early as the year 1792 a\r\nFrench army had entered the territory of Geneva, in order to co-operate\r\nwith the democratic party in the city. The movement was, however, checked\r\nby the resolute action of the Bernese Senate; and the relations of France\r\nto the Federal Government had subsequently been kept upon a friendly\r\nfooting by the good sense of Barthélemy, the French ambassador at Berne,\r\nand the discretion with which the Swiss Government avoided every occasion\r\nof offence. On the conquest of Northern Italy, Bonaparte was brought into\r\ndirect connection with Swiss affairs by a reference of certain points in\r\ndispute to his authority as arbitrator. Bonaparte solved the difficulty by\r\nannexing the district of the Valteline to the Cisalpine Republic; and from\r\nthat time he continued in communication with the Swiss democratic leaders\r\non the subject of a French intervention in Switzerland, the real purpose of\r\nwhich was to secure the treasure of Berne, and to organise a government,\r\nlike that of Holland and the Cisalpine Republic, in immediate dependence\r\nupon France.\r\n\r\n[Helvetic Republic, April 12.]\r\n\r\n[War between France and Swiss Federation, June, 1798.]\r\n\r\nAt length the moment for armed interference arrived. On the 15th December,\r\n1797, a French force entered the Bishopric of Basle, and gave the signal\r\nfor insurrection in the Pays de Vaud. The Senate of Berne summoned the Diet\r\nof the Confederacy to provide for the common defence: the oath of\r\nfederation was renewed, and a decree was passed calling out the Federal\r\narmy. It was now announced by the French that they would support the\r\nVaudois revolutionary party, if attacked. The Bernese troops, however,\r\nadvanced; and the bearer of a flag of truce having been accidentally\r\nkilled, war was declared between the French Republic and the Government of\r\nBerne. Democratic movements immediately followed in the northern and\r\nwestern cantons; the Bernese Government attempted to negotiate with the\r\nFrench invaders, but discovered that no terms would be accepted short of\r\nthe entire destruction of the existing Federal Constitution. Hostilities\r\ncommenced; and the Bernese troops, supported by contingents from most of\r\nthe other cantons, offered a brave but ineffectual resistance to the\r\nadvance of the French, who entered the Federal capital on the 6th of March,\r\n1798. The treasure of Berne, amounting to about £800,000, accumulated by\r\nages of thrift and good management, was seized in order to provide for\r\nBonaparte's next campaign, and for a host of voracious soldiers and\r\ncontractors. A system of robbery and extortion, more shameless even than\r\nthat practised in Italy, was put in force against the cantonal governments,\r\nagainst the monasteries, and against private individuals. In compensation\r\nfor the material losses inflicted upon the country, the new Helvetic\r\nRepublic, one and indivisible, was proclaimed at Aarau. It conferred an\r\nequality of political rights upon all natives of Switzerland, and\r\nsubstituted for the ancient varieties of cantonal sovereignty a single\r\nnational government, composed, like that of France, of a Directory and two\r\nCouncils of Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe towns and districts which had been hitherto excluded from a share in\r\ngovernment welcomed a change which seemed to place them on a level with\r\ntheir former superiors: the mountain-cantons fought with traditional\r\nheroism in defence of the liberties which they had inherited from their\r\nfathers; but they were compelled, one after another, to submit to the\r\noverwhelming force of France, and to accept the new constitution. Yet, even\r\nnow, when peace seemed to have been restored, and the whole purpose of\r\nFrance attained, the tyranny and violence of the invaders exhausted the\r\nendurance of a spirited people. The magistrates of the Republic were\r\nexpelled from office at the word of a French Commission; hostages were\r\nseized; at length an oath of allegiance to the new order was required as a\r\ncondition for the evacuation of Switzerland by the French army. Revolt\r\nbroke out in Unterwalden, and a handful of peasants met the French army at\r\nthe village of Stanz, near the eastern shore of the Lake of Lucerne (Sept.\r\n8). There for three days they fought with unyielding courage. Their\r\nresistance inflamed the French to a cruel vengeance; slaughtered families\r\nand burning villages renewed, in this so-called crusade of liberty, the\r\nsavagery of ancient war.\r\n\r\n[French intrigues in Rome.]\r\n\r\nIntrigues at Rome paved the way for a French intervention in the affairs of\r\nthe Papal States, coincident in time with the invasion of Switzerland. The\r\nresidence of the French ambassador at Rome, Joseph Bonaparte, was the\r\ncentre of a democratic agitation. The men who moved about him were in great\r\npart strangers from the north of Italy, but they found adherents in the\r\nmiddle and professional classes in Rome itself, although the mass of the\r\npoor people, as well as the numerous body whose salaries or profits\r\ndepended upon ecclesiastical expenditure, were devoted to the priests and\r\nthe Papacy. In anticipation of disturbances, the Government ordered\r\ncompanies of soldiers to patrol the city. A collision occurred on the 28th\r\nDecember, 1797, between the patrols and a band of revolutionists, who,\r\nbeing roughly handled by the populace as well as by the soldiers, made\r\ntheir way for protection to the courtyard of the Palazzo Corsini, where\r\nJoseph Bonaparte resided. Here, in the midst of a confused struggle,\r\nGeneral Duphot, a member of the Embassy, was shot by a Papal soldier. [64]\r\n\r\n[Berthier enters Rome, Feb. 10, 1798.]\r\n\r\n[Roman Republic, Feb. 15, 1798.]\r\n\r\nThe French had now the pretext against the Papal Government which they\r\ndesired. Joseph Bonaparte instantly left the city, and orders were sent to\r\nBerthier, chief of the staff in northern Italy, to march upon Rome.\r\nBerthier advanced amid the acclamations of the towns and the curses of the\r\npeasantry, and entered Rome on the 10th of February, 1798. Events had\r\nproduced in the capital a much stronger inclination towards change than\r\nexisted on the approach of Bonaparte a year before. The treaty of Tolentino\r\nhad shaken the prestige of Papal authority; the loss of so many well-known\r\nworks of art, the imposition of new and unpopular taxes, had excited as\r\nmuch hatred against the defeated government as against the extortionate\r\nconquerors; even among the clergy and their retainers the sale of a portion\r\nof the Church-lands and the curtailment of the old Papal splendours had\r\nproduced alienation and discontent. There existed too within the Italian\r\nChurch itself a reforming party, lately headed by Ricci, bishop of Pistoia,\r\nwhich claimed a higher degree of independence for the clergy, and condemned\r\nthe assumption of universal authority by the Roman See. The ill-judged\r\nexercise of the Pope's temporal power during the last six years had gained\r\nmany converts to the opinion that the head of the Church would best perform\r\nhis office if emancipated from a worldly sovereignty, and restored to his\r\noriginal position of the first among the bishops. Thus, on its approach to\r\nRome, the Republican army found the city ripe for revolution. On the 15th\r\nof February an excited multitude assembled in the Forum, and, after\r\nplanting the tree of liberty in front of the Capitol, renounced the\r\nauthority of the Pope, and declared that the Roman people constituted\r\nitself a free Republic. The resolution was conveyed to Berthier, who\r\nrecognised the Roman Commonwealth, and made a procession through the city\r\nwith the solemnity of an ancient triumph. The Pope shut himself up in the\r\nVatican. His Swiss guard was removed, and replaced by one composed of\r\nFrench soldiers, at whose hands the Pontiff, now in his eighty-first year,\r\nsuffered unworthy insults. He was then required to renounce his temporal\r\npower, and, upon his refusal, was removed to Tuscany, and afterwards beyond\r\nthe Alps to Valence, where in 1799 he died, attended by a solitary\r\necclesiastic.\r\n\r\nIn the liberated capital a course of spoliation began, more thorough and\r\nsystematic than any that the French had yet effected. The riches of Rome\r\nbrought all the brokers and contractors of Paris to the spot. The museums,\r\nthe Papal residence, and the palaces of many of the nobility were robbed of\r\nevery article that could be moved; the very fixtures were cut away, when\r\nworth the carriage. On the first meeting of the National Institute in the\r\nVatican it was found that the doors had lost their locks; and when, by\r\norder of the French, masses were celebrated in the churches in expiation of\r\nthe death of Duphot, the patrols who were placed at the gates to preserve\r\norder rushed in and seized the sacred vessels. Yet the general robbery was\r\nfar less the work of the army than of the agents and contractors sent by\r\nthe Government. In the midst of endless peculation the soldiers were in\r\nwant of their pay and their food. A sense of the dishonour done to France\r\narose at length in the subordinate ranks of the army; and General Massena,\r\nwho succeeded Berthier, was forced to quit his command in consequence of\r\nthe protests of the soldiery against a system to which Massena had\r\nconspicuously given his personal sanction. It remained to embody the\r\nrecovered liberties of Rome in a Republican Constitution, which was, as a\r\nmatter of course, a reproduction of the French Directory and Councils of\r\nLegislature, under the practical control of the French general in command.\r\nWhat Rome had given to the Revolution in the fashion of classical\r\nexpressions was now more than repaid. The Directors were styled Consuls;\r\nthe divisions of the Legislature were known as the Senate and the\r\nTribunate; the Prætorship and the Quæstorship were recalled to life in the\r\nCourts of Justice. That the new era might not want its classical memorial,\r\na medal was struck, with the image and superscription of Roman heroism, to\r\n\"Berthier, the restorer of the city,\" and to \"Gaul, the salvation of the\r\nhuman race.\"\r\n\r\n[Expedition to Egypt, May, 1798.]\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of these enterprises in Switzerland and Central Italy\r\nthat the Directory assembled the forces which Bonaparte was to lead to the\r\nEast. The port of Expedition to embarkation was Toulon; and there, on the\r\n9th of May, 1798, Bonaparte took the command of the most formidable\r\narmament that had ever left the French shores. Great Britain was still but\r\nfeebly represented in the Mediterranean, a detachment from St. Vincent's\r\nfleet at Cadiz, placed under the command of Nelson, being the sole British\r\nforce in these waters. Heavy reinforcements were at hand; but in the\r\nmeantime Nelson had been driven by stress of weather from his watch upon\r\nToulon. On the 19th of May the French armament put out to sea, its\r\ndestination being still kept secret from the soldiers themselves. It\r\nappeared before Malta on the 16th of June. By the treachery of the knights\r\nBonaparte was put in possession of this stronghold, which he could not even\r\nhave attempted to besiege. After a short delay the voyage was resumed, and\r\nthe fleet reached Alexandria without having fallen in with the English, who\r\nhad now received their reinforcements. The landing was safely effected, and\r\nAlexandria fell at the first assault. After five days the army advanced\r\nupon Cairo. At the foot of the Pyramids the Mameluke cavalry vainly threw\r\nthemselves upon Bonaparte's soldiers. They were repulsed with enormous loss\r\non their own side and scarcely any on that of the French. Their camp was\r\nstormed; Cairo was occupied; and there no longer existed a force in Egypt\r\ncapable of offering any serious resistance to the invaders.\r\n\r\n[Battle of the Nile, Aug. 1.]\r\n\r\nBut the fortune which had brought Bonaparte's army safe into the Egyptian\r\ncapital was destined to be purchased by the utter destruction of his fleet.\r\nNelson had passed the French in the night, when, after much perplexity, he\r\ndecided on sailing in the direction of Egypt. Arriving at Alexandria before\r\nhis prey, he had hurried off in an imaginary pursuit to Rhodes and Crete.\r\nAt length he received information which led him to visit Alexandria a\r\nsecond time. He found the French fleet, numbering thirteen ships of the\r\nline and four frigates, at anchor in Aboukir Bay. [65] His own fleet was\r\nslightly inferior in men and guns, but he entered battle with a\r\npresentiment of the completeness of his victory. Other naval battles have\r\nbeen fought with larger forces; no destruction was ever so complete as that\r\nof the Battle of the Nile (August 1). Two ships of the line and two\r\nfrigates, out of the seventeen sail that met Nelson, alone escaped from his\r\nhands. Of eleven thousand officers and men, nine thousand were taken\r\nprisoners, or perished in the engagement. The army of Bonaparte was cut off\r\nfrom all hope of support or return; the Republic was deprived of\r\ncommunication with its best troops and its greatest general.\r\n\r\n[Coalition of 1798.]\r\n\r\nA coalition was now gathering against France superior to that of 1793 in\r\nthe support of Russia and the Ottoman Empire, although Spain was now on the\r\nside of the Republic, and Prussia, in spite of the warnings of the last two\r\nyears, refused to stir from its neutrality. The death of the Empress\r\nCatherine, and the accession of Paul, had caused a most serious change in\r\nthe prospects of Europe. Hitherto the policy of the Russian Court had been\r\nto embroil the Western Powers with one another, and to confine its efforts\r\nagainst the French Republic to promises and assurances; with Paul, after an\r\ninterval of total reaction, the professions became realities. [66] No\r\nmonarch entered so cordially into Pitt's schemes for a renewal of the\r\nEuropean league; no ally had joined the English minister with a sincerity\r\nso like his own. On the part of the Ottoman Government, the pretences of\r\nfriendship with which Bonaparte disguised the occupation of Egypt were\r\ntaken at their real worth. War was declared by the Porte; and a series of\r\nnegotiations, carried on during the autumn of 1798, united Russia, England,\r\nTurkey, and Naples in engagements of mutual support against the French\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n[Nelson at Naples, Sept., 1798.]\r\n\r\nA Russian army set out on its long march towards the Adriatic: the levies\r\nof Austria prepared for a campaign in the spring of 1799; but to the\r\nEnglish Government every moment that elapsed before actual hostilities was\r\nso much time given to uncertainties; and the man who had won the Battle of\r\nthe Nile ridiculed the precaution which had hitherto suffered the French to\r\nspread their intrigues through Italy, and closed the ports of Sicily and\r\nNaples to his own most urgent needs. Towards the end of September, Nelson\r\nappeared in the Bay of Naples, and was received with a delirium that\r\nrecalled the most effusive scenes in the French Revolution. [67] In the\r\ncity of Naples, as in the kingdom generally, the poorest classes were the\r\nfiercest enemies of reform, and the steady allies of the Queen and the\r\npriesthood against that section of the better-educated classes which had\r\nbegun to hope for liberty. The system of espionage and persecution with\r\nwhich the sister of Marie Antoinette avenged upon her own subjects the\r\nsufferings of her kindred had grown more oppressive with every new victory\r\nof the Revolution. In the summer of 1798 there were men languishing for the\r\nfifth year in prison, whose offences had never been investigated, and whose\r\nrelatives were not allowed to know whether they were dead or alive. A mode\r\nof expression, a fashion of dress, the word of an informer, consigned\r\ninnocent persons to the dungeon, with the possibility of torture. In the\r\nmidst of this tyranny of suspicion, in the midst of a corruption which made\r\nthe naval and military forces of the kingdom worse than useless, King\r\nFerdinand and his satellites were unwearied in their theatrical invocations\r\nof the Virgin and St. Januarius against the assailants of divine right and\r\nthe conquerors of Rome. A Court cowardly almost beyond the example of\r\nCourts, a police that had trained every Neapolitan to look upon his\r\nneighbour as a traitor, an administration that had turned one of the\r\nhardiest races in Europe into soldiers of notorious and disgraceful\r\ncowardice--such were the allies whom Nelson, ill-fitted for politics by his\r\nsailor-like inexperience and facile vanity, heroic in his tenderness and\r\nfidelity, in an evil hour encouraged to believe themselves invincible\r\nbecause they possessed his own support. On the 14th of November, 1798, King\r\nFerdinand published a proclamation, which, without declaring war on the\r\nFrench, announced that the King intended to occupy the Papal States and\r\nrestore the Papal government. The manifesto disclaimed all intention of\r\nconquest, and offered a free pardon to all compromised persons. Ten days\r\nlater the Neapolitan army crossed the frontier, led by the Austrian\r\ngeneral, Mack, who passed among his admirers for the greatest soldier in\r\nEurope. [68]\r\n\r\n[Ferdinand enters Rome, Nov. 29.]\r\n\r\nThe mass of the French troops, about twelve thousand in number, lay in the\r\nneighbourhood of Ancona; Rome and the intermediate stations were held by\r\nsmall detachments. Had Mack pushed forward towards the Upper Tiber, his\r\ninroad, even if it failed to crush the separated wings of the French army,\r\nmust have forced them to retreat; but, instead of moving with all his\r\nstrength through Central Italy, Mack led the bulk of his army upon Rome,\r\nwhere there was no French force capable of making a stand, and sent weak\r\nisolated columns towards the east of the peninsula, where the French were\r\nstrong enough to make a good defence. On the approach of the Neapolitans to\r\nRome, Championnet, the French commander, evacuated the city, leaving a\r\ngarrison in the Castle of St. Angelo, and fell back on Civita Castellana,\r\nthirty miles north of the capital. The King of Naples entered Rome on the\r\n29th November. The restoration of religion was celebrated by the erection\r\nof an immense cross in the place of the tree of liberty, by the immersion\r\nof several Jews in the Tiber, by the execution of a number of compromised\r\npersons whose pardon the King had promised, and by a threat to shoot one of\r\nthe sick French soldiers in the hospital for every shot fired by the guns\r\nof St. Angelo. [69] Intelligence was despatched to the exiled Pontiff of\r\nthe discomfiture of his enemies. \"By help of the divine grace,\" wrote King\r\nFerdinand, \"and of the most miraculous St. Januarius, we have to-day with\r\nour army entered the sacred city of Rome, so lately profaned by the\r\nimpious, who now fly terror-stricken at the sight of the Cross and of my\r\narms. Leave then, your Holiness, your too modest abode, and on the wings of\r\ncherubim, like the virgin of Loreto, come and descend upon the Vatican, to\r\npurify it by your sacred presence.\" A letter to the King of Piedmont, who\r\nhad already been exhorted by Ferdinand to encourage his peasants to\r\nassassinate French soldiers, informed him that \"the Neapolitans, guided by\r\nGeneral Mack, had sounded the hour of death to the French, and proclaimed\r\nto Europe, from the summit of the Capitol, that the time of the Kings had\r\ncome.\"\r\n\r\n[Mack defeated by Championnet, Dec. 6-13.]\r\n\r\nThe despatches to Piedmont fell into the hands of the enemy, and the usual\r\nmodes of locomotion would scarcely have brought Pope Pius to Rome in time\r\nto witness the exit of his deliverer. Ferdinand's rhapsodies were cut short\r\nby the news that his columns advancing into the centre and east of the\r\nPapal States had all been beaten or captured. Mack, at the head of the main\r\narmy, now advanced to avenge the defeat upon the French at Civita\r\nCastellana and Terni. But his dispositions were as unskilful as ever:\r\nwherever his troops encountered the enemy they were put to the rout; and,\r\nas he had neglected to fortify or secure a single position upon his line of\r\nmarch, his defeat by a handful of French soldiers on the north of Rome\r\ninvolved the loss of the country almost up to the gates of Naples. On the\r\nfirst rumour of Mack's reverses the Republican party at Rome declared for\r\nFrance. King Ferdinand fled; Championnet re-entered Rome, and, after a few\r\ndays' delay, advanced into Neapolitan territory. Here, however, he found\r\nhimself attacked by an enemy more formidable than the army which had been\r\norganised to expel the French from Italy. The Neapolitan peasantry, who, in\r\nsoldiers' uniform and under the orders of Mack, could scarcely be brought\r\nwithin sight of the French, fought with courage when an appeal to their\r\nreligious passions collected them in brigand-like bands under leaders of\r\ntheir own. Divisions of Championnet's army sustained severe losses; they\r\nsucceeded, however, in effecting their junction upon the Volturno; and the\r\nstronghold of Gaeta, being defended by regular soldiers and not by\r\nbrigands, surrendered to the French at the first summons.\r\n\r\n[French enter Naples, Jan. 23, 1799.]\r\n\r\nMack was now concentrating his troops in an entrenched camp before Capua.\r\nThe whole country was rising against the invaders; and, in spite of lost\r\nbattles and abandoned fortresses, the Neapolitan Government if it had\r\npossessed a spark of courage, might still have overthrown the French army,\r\nwhich numbered only 18,000 men. But the panic and suspicion which the\r\nGovernment had fostered among its subjects were now avenged upon itself.\r\nThe cry of treachery was raised on every side. The Court dreaded a\r\nRepublican rising; the priests and the populace accused the Court of\r\nconspiracy with the French; Mack protested that the soldiers were resolved\r\nto be beaten; the soldiers swore that they were betrayed by Mack. On the\r\nnight of the 21st of December, the Royal Family secretly went on board\r\nNelson's ship the _Vanguard_, and after a short interval they set sail\r\nfor Palermo, leaving the capital in charge of Prince Pignatelli, a courtier\r\nwhom no one was willing to obey. [70] Order was, however, maintained by a\r\ncivic guard enrolled by the Municipality, until it became known that Mack\r\nand Pignatelli had concluded an armistice with the French, and surrendered\r\nCapua and the neighbouring towns. Then the populace broke into wild uproar.\r\nThe prisons were thrown open; and with the arms taken from the arsenal the\r\nlazzaroni formed themselves into a tumultuous army, along with thousands of\r\ndesperate men let loose from the gaols and the galleys. The priests,\r\nhearing that negotiations for peace were opened, raised the cry of treason\r\nanew; and, with the watchword of the Queen, \"All the gentlemen are\r\nJacobins; only the people are faithful,\" they hounded on the mob to riot\r\nand murder. On the morning of January 15th hordes of lazzaroni issued from\r\nthe gates to throw themselves upon the French, who were now about nine\r\nmiles from the city; others dragged the guns down from the forts to defend\r\nthe streets. The Republican party, however, and that considerable body\r\namong the upper class which was made Republican by the chaos into which the\r\nCourt, with its allies, the priests, and the populace, had thrown Naples,\r\nkept up communication with Championnet, and looked forward to the entrance\r\nof the French as the only means of averting destruction and massacre. By a\r\nstratagem carried out on the night of the 20th they gained possession of\r\nthe fort of St. Elmo, while the French were already engaged in a bloody\r\nassault upon the suburbs. On the 23rd Championnet ordered the attack to be\r\nrenewed. The conspirators within St. Elmo hoisted the French flag and\r\nturned their guns upon the populace; the fortress of the Carmine was\r\nstormed by the French; and, before the last struggle for life and death\r\ncommenced in the centre of the city, the leaders of the lazzaroni listened\r\nto words of friendship which Championnet addressed to them in their own\r\nlanguage, and, with the incoherence of a half-savage race, escorted his\r\nsoldiers with cries of joy to the Church of St. Januarius, which\r\nChampionnet promised to respect and protect.\r\n\r\n[Parthenopean Republic.]\r\n\r\nChampionnet used his victory with a discretion and forbearance rare amongst\r\nFrench conquerors. He humoured the superstition of the populace; he\r\nencouraged the political hopes of the enlightened. A vehement revulsion of\r\nfeeling against the fugitive Court and in favour of Republican government\r\nfollowed the creation of a National Council by the French general, and his\r\nironical homage to the patron saint. The Kingdom of Naples was converted\r\ninto the Parthenopean Republic. New laws, new institutions, discussed in a\r\nrepresentative assembly, excited hopes and interests unknown in Naples\r\nbefore. But the inevitable incidents of a French occupation, extortion and\r\nimpoverishment, with all their bitter effects on the mind of the people,\r\nwere not long delayed. In every country district the priests were exciting\r\ninsurrection. The agents of the new Government, men with no experience in\r\npublic affairs, carried confusion wherever they went. Civil war broke out\r\nin fifty different places; and the barbarity of native leaders of\r\ninsurrection, like Fra Diavolo, was only too well requited by the French\r\ncolumns which traversed the districts in revolt.\r\n\r\n[War with Austria and Russia, March, 1799.]\r\n\r\nThe time was ill chosen by the French Government for an extension of the\r\narea of combat to southern Italy. Already the first division of the Russian\r\narmy, led by Suvaroff, had reached Moravia, and the Court of Vienna was\r\nonly awaiting its own moment for declaring war. So far were the\r\nnewly-established Governments in Rome and Naples from being able to assist\r\nthe French upon the Adige, that the French had to send troops to Rome and\r\nNaples to support the new Governments. The force which the French could\r\nplace upon the frontier was inferior to that which two years of preparation\r\nhad given to Austria: the Russians, who were expected to arrive in Lombardy\r\nin April, approached with the confidence of men who had given to the French\r\nnone of their recent triumphs. Nor among the leaders was personal\r\nsuperiority any longer markedly on the side of the French, as in the war of\r\nthe First Coalition. Suvaroff and the Archduke Charles were a fair match\r\nfor any of the Republican generals, except Bonaparte, who was absent in\r\nEgypt. The executive of France had deeply declined. Carnot was in exile;\r\nthe work of organisation which he had pursued with such energy and\r\ndisinterestedness flagged under his mediocre and corrupt successors.\r\nSkilful generals and brave soldiers were never wanting to the Republic; but\r\nno single controlling will, no storm of national passion, inspired the\r\nGovernment with the force which it had possessed under the Convention, and\r\nwhich returned to it under Napoleon.\r\n\r\nA new character was given to the war now breaking out by the inclusion of\r\nSwitzerland in the area of combat. In the war of the First Coalition,\r\nSwitzerland had been neutral territory; but the events of 1798 had left the\r\nFrench in possession of all Switzerland west of the Rhine, and an Austrian\r\nforce subsequently occupied the Grisons. The line separating the combatants\r\nnow ran without a break from Mainz to the Adriatic. The French armies were\r\nin continuous communication with one another, and the movements of each\r\ncould be modified according to the requirements of the rest. On the other\r\nhand, a disaster sustained at any one point of the line endangered every\r\nother point; for no neutral territory intervened, as in 1796, to check a\r\nlateral movement of the enemy, and to protect the communications of a\r\nFrench army in Lombardy from a victorious Austrian force in southern\r\nGermany. The importance of the Swiss passes in this relation was understood\r\nand even overrated by the French Government; and an energy was thrown into\r\ntheir mountain warfare which might have produced greater results upon the\r\nplains.\r\n\r\n[The Archduke Charles defeats Jourdan at Stockach, March, 25.]\r\n\r\nThree armies formed the order of battle on either side. Jourdan held the\r\nFrench command upon the Rhine; Massena in Switzerland; Scherer, the least\r\ncapable of the Republican generals, on the Adige. On the side of the\r\nAllies, the Archduke Charles commanded in southern Germany; in Lombardy the\r\nAustrians were led by Kray, pending the arrival of Suvaroff and his corps;\r\nin Switzerland the command was given to Hotze, a Swiss officer who had\r\ngained some distinction in foreign service. It was the design of the French\r\nto push their centre under Massena through the mountains into the Tyrol,\r\nand by a combined attack of the central and the southern army to destroy\r\nthe Austrians upon the upper Adige, while Jourdan, also in communication\r\nwith the centre, drove the Archduke down the Danube upon Vienna. Early in\r\nMarch the campaign opened. Massena assailed the Austrian positions east of\r\nthe head-waters of the Rhine, and forced back the enemy into the heart of\r\nthe Grisons. Jourdan crossed the Rhine at Strasburg, and passed the Black\r\nForest with 40,000 men. His orders were to attack the Archduke Charles,\r\nwhatever the Archduke's superiority of force. The French and the Austrian\r\narmies met at Stockach, near the head of the Lake of Constance (March 25).\r\nOverwhelming numbers gave the Archduke a complete victory. Jourdan was not\r\nonly stopped in his advance, but forced to retreat beyond the Rhine.\r\nWhatever might be the fortune of the armies of Switzerland and Italy, all\r\nhope of an advance upon Vienna by the Danube was at an end.\r\n\r\n[Murder of the French envoys at Rastadt, April 28.]\r\n\r\nFreed from the invader's presence, the Austrians now spread themselves over\r\nBaden, up to the gates of Rastadt, where, in spite of the war between\r\nFrance and Austria, the envoys of the minor German States still continued\r\ntheir conferences with the French agents. On the 28th of April the French\r\nenvoys, now three in number, were required by the Austrians to depart\r\nwithin twenty-four hours. An escort, for which they applied, was refused.\r\nScarcely had their carriages passed through the city gates when they were\r\nattacked by a squadron of Austrian hussars. Two of French envoys the French\r\nenvoys were murdered; the third left for dead. Whether this frightful\r\nviolation of international law was the mere outrage of a drunken soldiery,\r\nas it was represented to be by the Austrian Government; whether it was to\r\nany extent occasioned by superior civil orders, or connected with French\r\nemigrants living in the neighbourhood, remains unknown. Investigations\r\nbegun by the Archduke Charles were stopped by the Cabinet, in order that a\r\nmore public inquiry might be held by the Diet. This inquiry, however, never\r\ntook place. In the year 1804 all papers relating to the Archduke's\r\ninvestigation were removed by the Government from the military archives.\r\nThey have never since been discovered. [71]\r\n\r\n[Battle of Magnano, April 5.]\r\n\r\nThe outburst of wrath with which the French people learnt the fate of their\r\nenvoys would have cost Austria dear if Austria had now been the losing\r\nparty in the war; but, for the present, everything seemed to turn against\r\nthe Republic. Jourdan had scarcely been overthrown in Germany before a\r\nruinous defeat at Magnano, on the Adige, drove back the army of Italy to\r\nwithin a few miles of Milan; while Massena, deprived of the fruit of his\r\nown victories by the disasters of his colleagues, had to abandon the\r\neastern half of Switzerland, and to retire upon the line of the river\r\nLimnat, Lucerne, and the Gothard. Charles now moved from Germany into\r\nSwitzerland. Massena fixed his centre at Zürich, and awaited the Archduke's\r\nassault. For five weeks Charles remained inactive: at length, on the 4th of\r\nJune, he gave battle. After two days' struggle against greatly superior\r\nforces, Massena was compelled to evacuate Zürich. He retreated, however, no\r\nfarther than to the ridge of the Uetliberg, a few miles west of the city;\r\nand here, fortifying his new position, he held obstinately on, while the\r\nAustrians established themselves in the central passes of Switzerland, and\r\ndisaster after disaster seemed to be annihilating the French arms in Italy.\r\n\r\n[Suvaroff's Campaign in Lombardy, April-June.]\r\n\r\nSuvaroff, at the head of 17,000 Russians, had arrived in Lombardy in the\r\nmiddle of April. His first battle was fought, and his first victory won, at\r\nthe passage of the Adda on the 25th of April. It was followed by the\r\nsurrender of Milan and the dissolution of the Cisalpine Republic. Moreau,\r\nwho now held the French command, fell back upon Alessandria, intending to\r\ncover both Genoa and Turin; but a sudden movement of Suvaroff brought the\r\nRussians into the Sardinian capital before it was even known to be in\r\njeopardy. The French general, cut off from the roads over the Alps, threw\r\nhimself upon the Apennines above Genoa, and waited for the army which had\r\noccupied Naples, and which, under the command of Macdonald, was now\r\nhurrying to his support, gathering with it on its march the troops that lay\r\nscattered on the south of the Po. Macdonald moved swiftly through central\r\nItaly, and crossed the Apennines above Pistoia in the beginning of June.\r\nHis arrival at Modena with 20,000 men threatened to turn the balance in\r\nfavour of the French. Suvaroff, aware of his danger, collected all the\r\ntroops within reach with the utmost despatch, and pushed eastwards to meet\r\nMacdonald on the Trebbia. Moreau descended from the Apennines in the same\r\ndirection; but he had underrated the swiftness of the Russian general; and,\r\nbefore he had advanced over half the distance, Macdonald was attacked by\r\nSuvaroff on the Trebbia, and overthrown in three days of the most desperate\r\nfighting that had been seen in the war (June 18). [72]\r\n\r\n[Naples.]\r\n\r\nAll southern Italy now rose against the Governments established by the\r\nFrench. Cardinal Ruffo, with a band of fanatical peasants, known as the\r\nArmy of the Faith, made himself master of Apulia and Calabria amid scenes\r\nof savage cruelty, and appeared before Naples, where the lazzaroni were\r\nready to unite with the hordes of the Faithful in murder and pillage.\r\nConfident of support within the city, and assisted by some English and\r\nRussian vessels in the harbour, Ruffo attacked the suburbs of Naples on the\r\nmorning of the 13th of June. Massacre and outrage continued within and\r\nwithout the city for five days. On the morning of the 19th, the Cardinal\r\nproposed a suspension of arms. It was accepted by the Republicans, who were\r\nin possession of the forts. Negotiations followed. On the 23rd conditions\r\nof peace were signed by Ruffo on behalf of the King of Naples, and by the\r\nrepresentatives of Great Britain and of Russia in guarantee for their\r\nfaithful execution. It was agreed that the Republican garrison should march\r\nout with the honours of war; that their persons and property should be\r\nrespected; that those who might prefer to leave the country should be\r\nconveyed to Toulon on neutral vessels; and that all who remained at home\r\nshould be free from molestation.\r\n\r\n[Reign of Terror.]\r\n\r\nThe garrison did not leave the forts that night. On the following morning,\r\nwhile they were embarking on board the polaccas which were to take them to\r\nToulon, Nelson's fleet appeared in the Bay of Naples. Nelson declared that\r\nin treating with rebels Cardinal Ruffo had disobeyed the King's orders, and\r\nhe pronounced the capitulation null and void. The polaccas, with the\r\nRepublicans crowded on board, were attached to the sterns of the English\r\nships, pending the arrival of King Ferdinand. On the 29th of June, Admiral\r\nCaracciolo, who had taken office under the new Government, and on its fall\r\nhad attempted to escape in disguise, was brought a captive before Nelson.\r\nNelson ordered him to be tried by a Neapolitan court-martial, and, in spite\r\nof his old age, his rank, and his long service to the State, caused him to\r\nbe hanged from a Neapolitan ship's yard-arm, and his body to be thrown into\r\nthe sea. Some days later, King Ferdinand arrived from Palermo, and Nelson\r\nnow handed over all his prisoners to the Bourbon authorities. A reign of\r\nterror followed. Innumerable persons were thrown into prison.\r\nCourts-martial, or commissions administering any law that pleased\r\nthemselves, sent the flower of the Neapolitan nation to the scaffold. Above\r\na hundred sentences of death were carried out in Naples itself:\r\nconfiscation, exile, and imprisonment struck down thousands of families. It\r\nwas peculiar to the Neapolitan proscriptions that a Government with the\r\nnames of religion and right incessantly upon its lips selected for\r\nextermination both among men and women those who were most distinguished in\r\ncharacter, in science, and in letters, whilst it chose for promotion and\r\nenrichment those who were known for deeds of savage violence. The part\r\nborne by Nelson in this work of death has left a stain on his glory which\r\ntime cannot efface. [73]\r\n\r\n[Austrian designs in Italy.]\r\n\r\n[New plan of the War.]\r\n\r\nIt was on the advance of the Army of Naples under Macdonald that the French\r\nrested their last hope of recovering Lombardy. The battle of the Trebbia\r\nscattered this hope to the winds, and left it only too doubtful whether\r\nFrance could be saved from invasion. Suvaroff himself was eager to fall\r\nupon Moreau before Macdonald could rally from his defeat, and to drive him\r\nwestwards along the coast-road into France. It was a moment when the\r\nfortune of the Republic hung in the scales. Had Suvaroff been permitted to\r\nfollow his own counsels, France would probably have seen the remnant of her\r\nItalian armies totally destroyed, and the Russians advancing upon Lyons or\r\nMarseilles. The Republic was saved, as it had been in 1793, by the\r\ndissensions of its enemies. It was not only for the purpose of resisting\r\nFrench aggression that Austria had renewed the war, but for the purpose of\r\nextending its own dominion in Italy. These designs were concealed from\r\nRussia; they were partially made known by Thugut to the British Ambassador,\r\nunder the most stringent obligation to secrecy. On the 17th of August,\r\n1799, Lord Minto acquainted his Government with the intentions of the\r\nAustrian Court. \"The Emperor proposes to retain Piedmont, and to take all\r\nthat part of Savoy which is important in a military view. I have no doubt\r\nof his intention to keep Nice also, if he gets it, which will make the Var\r\nhis boundary with France. The whole territory of the Genoese Republic seems\r\nto be an object of serious speculation ... The Papal Legations will, I am\r\npersuaded, be retained by the Emperor ... I am not yet master of the\r\ndesigns on Tuscany.\" [74] This was the sense in which Austria understood\r\nthe phrase of defending the rights of Europe against French aggression. It\r\nwas not, however, for this that the Czar had sent his army from beyond the\r\nCarpathians. Since the opening of the campaign Suvaroff had been in\r\nperpetual conflict with the military Council of Vienna. [75] Suvaroff was\r\nbent upon a ceaseless pursuit of the enemy; the Austrian Council insisted\r\nupon the reduction of fortresses. What at first appeared as a mere\r\ndifference of military opinion appeared in its true political character\r\nwhen the allied troops entered Piedmont. The Czar desired with his whole\r\nsoul to crush the men of the Revolution, and to restore the governments\r\nwhich France had overthrown. As soon as his troops entered Turin, Suvaroff\r\nproclaimed the restoration of the House of Savoy, and summoned all\r\nSardinian officers to fight for their King. He was interrupted by a letter\r\nfrom Vienna requiring him to leave political affairs in the hands of the\r\nViennese Ministry. [76] The Russians had already done as much in Italy as\r\nthe Austrian Cabinet desired them to do, and the first wish of Thugut was\r\nnow to free himself from his troublesome ally. Suvaroff raged against the\r\nAustrian Government in every despatch, and tendered his resignation. His\r\ncomplaints inclined the Czar to accept a new military scheme, which was\r\nsupported by the English Government in the hope of terminating the\r\ncontention between Suvaroff and the Austrian Council. It was agreed at St.\r\nPetersburg that, as soon as the French armies were destroyed, the reduction\r\nof the Italian fortresses should be left exclusively to the Austrians; and\r\nthat Suvaroff, uniting with a new Russian army now not far distant, should\r\ncomplete the conquest of Switzerland, and then invade France by the Jura,\r\nsupported on his right by the Archduke Charles. An attack was to be made at\r\nthe same time upon Holland by a combined British and Russian force.\r\n\r\nIf executed in its original form, this design would have thrown a\r\nformidable army upon France at the side of Franche Comté, where it is least\r\nprotected by fortresses. But at the last moment an alteration in the plan\r\nwas made at Vienna. The prospect of an Anglo-Russian victory in Holland\r\nagain fixed the thoughts of the Austrian Minister upon Belgium, which had\r\nbeen so lightly abandoned five years before, and which Thugut now hoped to\r\nre-occupy and to barter for Bavaria or some other territory. \"The Emperor,\"\r\nhe wrote, \"cannot turn a deaf ear to the appeal of his subjects. He cannot\r\nconsent that the Netherlands shall be disposed of without his own\r\nconcurrence.\" [77] The effect of this perverse and mischievous resolution\r\nwas that the Archduke Charles received orders to send the greater part of\r\nhis army from Switzerland to the Lower Rhine, and to leave only 25,000 men\r\nto support the new Russian division which, under General Korsakoff, was\r\napproaching from the north to meet Suvaroff. The Archduke, as soon as the\r\nnew instructions reached him, was filled with the presentiment of disaster,\r\nand warned his Government that in the general displacement of forces an\r\nopportunity would be given to Massena, who was still above Zürich, to\r\nstrike a fatal blow. Every despatch that passed between Vienna and St.\r\nPetersburg now increased the Czar's suspicion of Austria. The Pope and the\r\nKing of Naples were convinced that Thugut had the same design upon their\r\nown territories which had been shown in his treatment of Piedmont. [78]\r\nThey appealed to the Czar for protection. The Czar proposed a European\r\nCongress, at which the Powers might learn one another's real intentions.\r\nThe proposal was not accepted by Austria; but, while disclaiming all desire\r\nto despoil the King of Sardinia, the Pope, or the King of Naples, Thugut\r\nadmitted that Austria claimed an improvement of its Italian frontier, in\r\nother words, the annexation of a portion of Piedmont, and of the northern\r\npart of the Roman States. The Czar replied that he had taken up arms in\r\norder to check one aggressive Government, and that he should not permit\r\nanother to take its place.\r\n\r\n[Battle of Novi, Aug. 15.]\r\n\r\nFor the moment, however, the allied forces continued to co-operate in Italy\r\nagainst the French army on the Apennines covering Genoa. This army had\r\nreceived reinforcements, and was now placed under the command of Joubert,\r\none of the youngest and most spirited of the Republican generals. Joubert\r\ndetermined to attack the Russians before the fall of Mantua should add the\r\nbesieging army to Suvaroff's forces in the field. But the information which\r\nhe received from Lombardy misled him. In the second week of August he was\r\nstill unaware that Mantua had fallen a fortnight before. He descended from\r\nthe mountains to attack Suvaroff at Tortona, with a force about equal to\r\nSuvaroff's own. On reaching Novi he learnt that the army of Mantua was also\r\nbefore him (Aug. 15). It was too late to retreat; Joubert could only give\r\nto his men the example of Republican spirit and devotion. Suvaroff himself,\r\nwith Kray, the conqueror of Mantua, began the attack: the onset of a second\r\nAustrian corps, at the moment when the strength of the Russians was\r\nfailing, decided the day. Joubert did not live to witness the close of a\r\ndefeat which cost France eleven thousand men. [79]\r\n\r\n[Suvaroff goes into Switzerland.]\r\n\r\nThe allied Governments had so framed their plans that the most overwhelming\r\nvictory could produce no result. Instead of entering France, Suvaroff was\r\ncompelled to turn back into Switzerland, while the Austrians continued to\r\nbesiege the fortresses of Piedmont. In Switzerland Suvaroff had to meet an\r\nenemy who was forewarned of his approach, and who had employed every\r\nresource of military skill and daring to prevent the union of the two\r\nRussian armies now advancing from the south and the north. Before Suvaroff\r\ncould leave Italy, a series of admirably-planned attacks had given Massena\r\nthe whole network of the central Alpine passes, and closed every avenue of\r\ncommunication between Suvaroff and the army with which he hoped to\r\nco-operate. The folly of the Austrian Cabinet seconded the French general's\r\nexertions. No sooner had Korsakoff and the new Russian division reached\r\nSchaffhausen than the Archduke Charles, forced by his orders from Vienna,\r\nturned northwards (Sept. 3), leaving the Russians with no support but\r\nHotze's corps, which was scattered over six cantons. [80] Korsakoff\r\nadvanced to Zürich; Massena remained in his old position on the Uetliberg.\r\nIt was now that Suvaroff began his march into the Alps, sorely harassed and\r\ndelayed by the want of the mountain-teams which the Austrians had promised\r\nhim, and filled with the apprehension that Korsakoff would suffer some\r\nirreparable disaster before his own arrival.\r\n\r\n[Second Battle of Zürich, Sept. 26.]\r\n\r\nTwo roads lead from the Italian lakes to central Switzerland; one, starting\r\nfrom the head of Lago Maggiore and crossing the Gothard, ends on the shore\r\nof Lake Lucerne; the other, crossing the Splügen, runs from the Lake of\r\nComo to Reichenau, in the valley of the Rhine. The Gothard in 1799 was not\r\npracticable for cannon; it was chosen by Suvaroff, however, for his own\r\nadvance, with the object of falling upon Massena's rear with the utmost\r\npossible speed. He left Bellinzona on the 21st of September, fought his way\r\nin a desperate fashion through the French outposts that guarded the defiles\r\nof the Gothard, and arrived at Altorf near the Lake of Lucerne. Here it was\r\ndiscovered that the westward road by which Suvaroff meant to strike upon\r\nthe enemy's communications had no existence. Abandoning this design,\r\nSuvaroff made straight for the district where his colleague was encamped,\r\nby a shepherd's path leading north-eastwards across heights of 7,000 feet\r\nto the valley of the Muotta. Over this desolate region the Russians made\r\ntheir way; and the resolution which brought them as far as the Muotta would\r\nhave brought them past every other obstacle to the spot where they were to\r\nmeet their countrymen. But the hour was past. While Suvaroff was still\r\nstruggling in the mountains, Massena advanced against Zürich, put\r\nKorsakoff's army to total rout, and drove it, with the loss of all its\r\nbaggage and of a great part of its artillery, outside the area of\r\nhostilities.\r\n\r\n[Retreat of Suvaroff.]\r\n\r\nThe first rumours of the catastrophe reached Suvaroff on the Muotta; he\r\nstill pushed on eastwards, and, though almost without ammunition, overthrew\r\na corps commanded by Massena in person, and cleared the road over the\r\nPragel at the point of the bayonet, arriving in Glarus on the 1st of\r\nOctober. Here the full extent of Korsakoff's disaster was made known to\r\nhim. To advance or to fall back was ruin. It only remained for Suvaroff's\r\narmy to make its escape across a wild and snow-covered mountain-tract into\r\nthe valley of the Rhine, where the river flows below the northern heights\r\nof the Grisons. This exploit crowned a campaign which filled Europe with\r\nastonishment. The Alpine traveller of to-day turns with some distrust from\r\nnarratives which characterise with every epithet of horror and dismay\r\nscenes which are the delight of our age; but the retreat of Suvaroff's\r\narmy, a starving, footsore multitude, over what was then an untrodden\r\nwilderness of rock, and through fresh-fallen autumn snow two feet deep, had\r\nlittle in common with the boldest feats of Alpine hardihood. [81] It was\r\nachieved with loss and suffering; it brought the army from a position of\r\nthe utmost danger into one of security; but it was followed by no renewed\r\nattack. Proposals for a combination between Suvaroff and the Archduke\r\nCharles resulted only in mutual taunts and menaces. The co-operation of\r\nRussia in the war was at an end. The French remained masters of the whole\r\nof the Swiss territory that they had lost since the beginning of the\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\n[British and Russian expedition against Holland Aug. 1799.]\r\n\r\nIn the summer months of 1799 the Czar had relieved his irritation against\r\nAustria by framing in concert with the British Cabinet the plan for a joint\r\nexpedition against Holland. It was agreed that 25,000 English and 17,000\r\nRussian troops, brought from the Baltic in British ships, should attack the\r\nFrench in the Batavian Republic, and raise an insurrection on behalf of the\r\nexiled Stadtholder. Throughout July the Kentish coast-towns were alive with\r\nthe bustle of war; and on the 13th of August the first English division,\r\nnumbering 12,000 men, set sail from Deal under the command of Sir Ralph\r\nAbercromby. After tossing off the Dutch coast for a fortnight, the troops\r\nlanded at the promontory of the Helder. A Dutch corps was defeated on the\r\nsand-hills, and the English captured the fort of the Helder, commanding the\r\nTexel anchorage. Immediately afterwards a movement in favour of the\r\nStadtholder broke out among the officers of the Dutch fleet. The captains\r\nhoisted the Orange flag, and brought their ships over to the English.\r\n\r\nThis was the first and the last result of the expedition. The Russian\r\ncontingent and a second English division reached Holland in the middle of\r\nSeptember, and with them came the Duke of York, who now took the command\r\nout of the hands of Abercromby. On the other side reinforcements daily\r\narrived from France, until the enemy's troops, led by General Brune, were\r\nequal in strength to the invaders. A battle fought at Alkmaar on the 19th\r\nof September gave the Allies some partial successes and no permanent\r\nadvantage; and on the 3rd of October the Duke of York gained one of those\r\nso-called victories which result in the retreat of the conquerors. Never\r\nwere there so many good reasons for a bad conclusion. The Russians moved\r\ntoo fast or too slow; the ditches set at nought the rules of strategy; it\r\nwas discovered that the climate of Holland was unfavourable to health, and\r\nthat the Dutch had not the slightest inclination to get back their\r\nStadtholder. The result of a series of mischances, every one of which would\r\nhave been foreseen by an average midshipman in Nelson's fleet, or an\r\naverage sergeant in Massena's army, was that York had to purchase a retreat\r\nfor the allied forces at a price equivalent to an unconditional surrender.\r\nHe was allowed to re-embark on consideration that Great Britain restored to\r\nthe French 8,000 French and Dutch prisoners, and handed over in perfect\r\nrepair all the military works which our own soldiers had erected at the\r\nHelder. Bitter complaints were raised among the Russian officers against\r\nYork's conduct of the expedition. He was accused of sacrificing the Russian\r\nregiments in battle, and of courting a general defeat in order not to\r\nexpose his own men. The accusation was groundless. Where York was,\r\ntreachery or bad faith was superfluous. York in command, the feeblest enemy\r\nbecame invincible. Incompetence among the hereditary chiefs of the English\r\narmy had become part of the order of nature. The Ministry, when taxed with\r\nfailure, obstinately shut their eyes to the true cause of the disaster.\r\nParliament was reminded that defeat was the most probable conclusion of any\r\nmilitary operations that we might undertake, and that England ought not to\r\nexpect success when Prussia and Austria had so long met only with\r\nmisfortune. Under the command of Nelson, English sailors were indeed\r\nmanifesting that kind of superiority to the seamen of other nations which\r\nthe hunter possesses over his prey; yet this gave no reason why foresight\r\nand daring should count for anything ashore. If the nation wished to see\r\nits soldiers undefeated, it must keep them at home to defend their country.\r\nEven among the Opposition no voice was raised to protest against the system\r\nwhich sacrificed English life and military honour to the dignity of the\r\nRoyal Family. The collapse of the Anglo-Russian expedition was viewed with\r\nmore equanimity in England than in Russia. The Czar dismissed his\r\nunfortunate generals. York returned home, to run horses at Newmarket, to\r\njob commissions with his mistress, and to earn his column at St. James's\r\nPark.\r\n\r\n[Unpopularity of the Directory.]\r\n\r\n[Plans of Siéyès 1799.]\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment, when the tide of military success was already\r\nturning in favour of the Republic, that the revolution took place which\r\nmade Bonaparte absolute ruler of France. Since the attack of the Government\r\nupon the Royalists in Fructidor, 1797, the Directory and the factions had\r\ncome no nearer to a system of mutual concession, or to a peaceful\r\nacquiescence in the will of a parliamentary majority. The Directory,\r\nassailed both by the extreme Jacobins and by the Constitutionalists, was\r\nstill strong enough to crush each party in its turn. The elections of 1798,\r\nwhich strengthened the Jacobins, were annulled with as little scruple as\r\nthe Royalist elections in the preceding year; it was only when defeat in\r\nGermany and Italy had brought the Government into universal discredit that\r\nthe Constitutionalist party, fortified by the return of a large majority in\r\nthe elections of 1799, dared to turn the attack upon the Directors\r\nthemselves. The excitement of foreign conquest had hitherto shielded the\r\nabuses of Government from criticism; but when Italy was lost, when generals\r\nand soldiers found themselves without pay, without clothes, without\r\nreinforcements, one general outcry arose against the Directory, and the\r\nnation resolved to have done with a Government whose outrages and\r\nextortions had led to nothing but military ruin. The disasters of France in\r\nthe spring of 1799, which resulted from the failure of the Government to\r\nraise the armies to their proper strength, were not in reality connected\r\nwith the defects of the Constitution. They were caused in part by the\r\nshameless jobbery of individual members of the Administration, in part by\r\nthe absence of any agency, like that of the Conventional Commissioners of\r\n1793, to enforce the control of the central Government over the local\r\nauthorities, left isolated and independent by the changes of 1789. Faults\r\nenough belonged, however, to the existing political order; and the\r\nConstitutionalists, who now for the second time found themselves with a\r\nmajority in the Councils, were not disposed to prolong a system which from\r\nthe first had turned their majorities into derision. A party grew up around\r\nthe Abbé Siéyès intent upon some change which should give France a\r\ngovernment really representing its best elements. What the change was to be\r\nfew could say; but it was known that Siéyès, who had taken a leading part\r\nin 1789, and had condemned the Constitution of 1795 from the moment when it\r\nwas sketched, had elaborated a scheme which he considered exempt from every\r\nerror that had vitiated its predecessors. As the first step to reform,\r\nSiéyès himself was elected to a Directorship then falling vacant. Barras\r\nattached himself to Siéyès; the three remaining Directors, who were\r\nJacobins and popular in Paris, were forced to surrender their seats. Siéyès\r\nnow only needed a soldier to carry out his plans. His first thought had\r\nturned on Joubert, but Joubert was killed at Novi. Moreau scrupled to raise\r\nhis hand against the law; Bernadotte, a general distinguished both in war\r\nand in administration, declined to play a secondary part. Nor in fact was\r\nthe support of Siéyès indispensable to any popular and ambitious soldier\r\nwho was prepared to attack the Government. Siéyès and his friends offered\r\nthe alliance of a party weighty in character and antecedents; but there\r\nwere other well-known names and powerful interests at the command of an\r\nenterprising leader, and all France awaited the downfall of a Government\r\nwhose action had resulted only in disorder at home and defeat abroad.\r\n\r\n[Bonaparte returns from Egypt, Oct., 1799.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the political situation when, in the summer of 1799, Bonaparte,\r\nbaffled in an attack upon the Syrian fortress of St. Jean d'Acre, returned\r\nto Egypt, and received the first tidings from Europe which had reached him\r\nsince the outbreak of the war. He saw that his opportunity had arrived. He\r\ndetermined to leave his army, whose ultimate failure was inevitable, and to\r\noffer to France in his own person that sovereignty of genius and strength\r\nfor which the whole nation was longing. On the 7th of October a despatch\r\nfrom Bonaparte was read in the Council of Five Hundred, announcing a\r\nvictory over the Turks at Aboukir. It brought the first news that had been\r\nreceived for many months from the army of Egypt; it excited an outburst of\r\njoyous enthusiasm for the general and the army whom a hated Government was\r\nbelieved to have sent into exile; it recalled that succession of victories\r\nwhich had been unchecked by a single defeat, and that Peace which had given\r\nFrance a dominion wider than any that her Kings had won. While every\r\nthought was turned upon Bonaparte, the French nation suddenly heard that\r\nBonaparte himself had landed on the coast of Provence. \"I was sitting that\r\nday,\" says Béranger in his autobiography, \"in our reading-room with thirty\r\nor forty other persons. Suddenly the news was brought in that Bonaparte had\r\nreturned from Egypt. At the words, every man in the room started to his\r\nfeet and burst into one long shout of joy.\" The emotion portrayed by\r\nBéranger was that of the whole of France. Almost everything that now\r\ndarkens the early fame of Bonaparte was then unknown. His falsities, his\r\ncold, unpitying heart were familiar only to accomplices and distant\r\nsufferers; even his most flagrant wrongs, such as the destruction of\r\nVenice, were excused by a political necessity, or disguised as acts of\r\nrighteous chastisement. The hopes, the imagination of France saw in\r\nBonaparte the young, unsullied, irresistible hero of the Republic. His fame\r\nhad risen throughout a crisis which had destroyed all confidence in others.\r\nThe stale placemen of the factions sank into insignificance by his side;\r\neven sincere Republicans, who feared the rule of a soldier, confessed that\r\nit is not always given to a nation to choose the mode of its own\r\ndeliverance. From the moment that Bonaparte landed at Fréjus, he was master\r\nof France.\r\n\r\n[Conspiracy of Siéyès and Bonaparte.]\r\n\r\nSiéyès saw that Bonaparte, and no one else, was the man through whom he\r\ncould overthrow the existing Constitution. [82] So little sympathy existed,\r\nhowever, between Siéyès and the soldier to whom he now offered his support,\r\nthat Bonaparte only accepted Siéyès' project after satisfying himself that\r\nneither Barras nor Bernadotte would help him to supreme power. Once\r\nconvinced of this, Bonaparte closed with Siéyès' offers. It was agreed that\r\nSiéyès and his friend Ducos should resign their Directorships, and that the\r\nthree remaining Directors should be driven from office. The Assemblies, or\r\nany part of them favourable to the plot, were to appoint a Triumvirate\r\ncomposed of Bonaparte, Siéyès, and Ducos, for the purpose of drawing up a\r\nnew Constitution. In the new Constitution it was understood, though without\r\nany definite arrangement, that Bonaparte and Siéyès were to be the leading\r\nfigures. The Council of Ancients was in great part in league with the\r\nconspirators: the only obstacle likely to hinder the success of the plot\r\nwas a rising of the Parisian populace. As a precaution against attack, it\r\nwas determined to transfer the meeting of the Councils to St. Cloud.\r\nBonaparte had secured the support of almost all the generals and troops in\r\nParis. His brother Lucien, now President of the Council of Five Hundred,\r\nhoped to paralyse the action of his own Assembly, in which the conspirators\r\nwere in the minority.\r\n\r\n[Coup d'état, 18 Brumaire (Nov. 9), 1799.]\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the 9th of November (18 Brumaire), a crowd of\r\ngenerals and officers met before Bonaparte's house. At the same moment a\r\nportion of the Council of Ancients assembled, and passed a decree which\r\nadjourned the session to St. Cloud, and conferred on Bonaparte the command\r\nover all the troops in Paris. The decree was carried to Bonaparte's house\r\nand read to the military throng, who acknowledged it by brandishing their\r\nswords. Bonaparte then ordered the troops to their posts, received the\r\nresignation of Barras, and arrested the two remaining Directors in the\r\nLuxembourg. During the night there was great agitation in Paris. The arrest\r\nof the two Directors and the display of military force revealed the true\r\nnature of the conspiracy, and excited men to resistance who had hitherto\r\nseen no great cause for alarm. The Councils met at St. Cloud at two on the\r\nnext day. The Ancients were ready for what was coming; the Five Hundred\r\nrefused to listen to Bonaparte's accomplices, and took the oath of fidelity\r\nto the Constitution. Bonaparte himself entered the Council of Ancients, and\r\nin violent, confused language declared that he had come to save the\r\nRepublic from unseen dangers. He then left the Assembly, and entered the\r\nChamber of the Five Hundred, escorted by armed grenadiers. A roar of\r\nindignation greeted the appearance of the bayonets. The members rushed in a\r\nmass upon Bonaparte, and drove him out of the hall. His brother now left\r\nthe President's chair and joined the soldiers outside, whom he harangued in\r\nthe character of President of the Assembly. The soldiers, hitherto\r\nwavering, were assured by Lucien's civil authority and his treacherous\r\neloquence. The drums beat; the word of command was given; and the last free\r\nrepresentatives of France struggled through doorways and windows before the\r\nlevelled and advancing bayonets.\r\n\r\n[Siéyès' plan of Constitution.]\r\n\r\nThe Constitution which Siéyès hoped now to impose upon France had been\r\nelaborated by its author at the close of the Reign of Terror. Designed at\r\nthat epoch, it bore the trace of all those apprehensions which gave shape\r\nto the Constitution of 1795. The statutory outrages of 1793, the Royalist\r\nreaction shown in the events of Vendémiaire, were the perils from which\r\nboth Siéyès and the legislators of 1795 endeavoured to guard the future of\r\nFrance. It had become clear that a popular election might at any moment\r\nreturn a royalist majority to the Assembly: the Constitution of 1795\r\naverted this danger by prolonging the power of the Conventionalists; Siéyès\r\novercame it by extinguishing popular election altogether. He gave to the\r\nnation no right but that of selecting half a million persons who should be\r\neligible to offices in the Communes, and who should themselves elect a\r\nsmaller body of fifty thousand, eligible to offices in the Departments. The\r\nfifty thousand were in their turn to choose five thousand, who should be\r\neligible to places in the Government and the Legislature. The actual\r\nappointments were to be made, however, not by the electors, but by the\r\nExecutive. With the irrational multitude thus deprived of the power to\r\nbring back its old oppressors, priests, royalists, and nobles might safely\r\ndo their worst. By way of still further precaution, Siéyès proposed that\r\nevery Frenchman who had been elected to the Legislature since 1789 should\r\nbe inscribed for ten years among the privileged five thousand.\r\n\r\nSuch were the safeguards provided against a Bourbonist reaction. To guard\r\nagainst a recurrence of those evils which France had suffered from the\r\nprecipitate votes of a single Assembly, Siéyès broke up the legislature\r\ninto as many chambers as there are stages in the passing of a law. The\r\nfirst chamber, or Council of State, was to give shape to measures suggested\r\nby the Executive; a second chamber, known as the Tribunate, was to discuss\r\nthe measures so framed, and ascertain the objections to which they were\r\nliable; the third chamber, known as the Legislative Body, was to decide in\r\nsilence for or against the measures, after hearing an argument between\r\nrepresentatives of the Council and of the Tribunate. As a last impregnable\r\nbulwark against Jacobins and Bourbonists alike, Siéyès created a Senate\r\nwhose members should hold office for life, and be empowered to annul every\r\nlaw in which the Chambers might infringe upon the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt only remained to invent an Executive. In the other parts of his\r\nConstitution, Siéyès had borrowed from Rome, from Greece, and from Venice;\r\nin his Executive he improved upon the political theories of Great Britain.\r\nHe proposed that the Government should consist of two Consuls and a Great\r\nElector; the Elector, like an English king, appointing and dismissing the\r\nConsuls, but taking no active part in the administration himself. The\r\nConsuls were to be respectively restricted to the affairs of peace and of\r\nwar. Grotesque under every aspect, the Constitution of Siéyès was really\r\ncalculated to effect in all points but one the end which he had in view.\r\nHis object was to terminate the convulsions of France by depriving every\r\nelement in the State of the power to create sudden change. The members of\r\nhis body politic, a Council that could only draft, a Tribunate that could\r\nonly discuss, a Legislature that could only vote, Yes or No, were impotent\r\nfor mischief; and the nation itself ceased to have a political existence as\r\nsoon as it had selected its half-million notables.\r\n\r\n[Siéyès and Bonaparte.]\r\n\r\nSo far, nothing could have better suited the views of Bonaparte; and up to\r\nthis point Bonaparte quietly accepted Siéyès' plan. But the general had his\r\nown scheme for what was to follow. Siéyès might apportion the act of\r\ndeliberation among debating societies and dumb juries to the full extent of\r\nhis own ingenuity; but the moment that he applied his disintegrating method\r\nto the Executive, Bonaparte swept away the flimsy reasoner, and set in the\r\nmidst of his edifice of shadows the reality of an absolute personal rule.\r\nThe phantom Elector, and the Consuls who were to be the Elector's\r\ntenants-at-will, corresponded very little to the power which France desired\r\nto see at its head. \"Was there ever anything so ridiculous?\" cried\r\nBonaparte. \"What man of spirit could accept such a post?\" It was in vain\r\nthat Siéyès had so nicely set the balance. His theories gave to France only\r\nthe pageants which disguised the extinction of the nation beneath a single\r\nwill: the frame of executive government which the country received in 1799\r\nwas that which Bonaparte deduced from the conception of an absolute central\r\npower. The First Consul summed up all executive authority in his own\r\nperson. By his side there were set two colleagues whose only function was\r\nto advise. A Council of State placed the highest skill and experience in\r\nFrance at the disposal of the chief magistrate, without infringing upon his\r\nsovereignty. All offices, both in the Ministries of State and in the\r\nprovinces, were filled by the nominees of the First Consul. No law could be\r\nproposed but at his desire.\r\n\r\n[Contrast of the Institutions of 1791 and 1799.]\r\n\r\n[Centralisation of 1799.]\r\n\r\nThe institutions given to France by the National Assembly of 1789 and those\r\ngiven to it in the Consulate exhibited a direct contrast seldom found\r\noutside the region of abstract terms. Local customs, survivals of earlier\r\nlaw, such as soften the difference between England and the various\r\ndemocracies of the United States, had no place in the sharp-cut types in\r\nwhich the political order of France was recast in 1791 and 1799. The\r\nConstituent Assembly had cleared the field before it began to reconstruct.\r\nIts reconstruction was based upon the Rights of Man, identified with the\r\nprinciple of local self-government by popular election. It deduced a system\r\nof communal administration so completely independent that France was\r\ndescribed by foreign critics as partitioned into 40,000 republics; and the\r\ncriticism was justified when, in 1793, it was found necessary to create a\r\nnew central Government, and to send commissioners from the capital into the\r\nprovinces. In the Constitution of 1791, judges, bishops, officers of the\r\nNational Guard, were all alike subjected to popular election; the Minister\r\nof War could scarcely move a regiment from one village to another without\r\nthe leave of the mayor of the commune. In the Constitution of 1799 all\r\nauthority was derived from the head of the State. A system of\r\ncentralisation came into force with which France under her kings had\r\nnothing to compare. All that had once served as a check upon monarchical\r\npower, the legal Parliaments, the Provincial Estates of Brittany and\r\nLanguedoc, the rights of lay and ecclesiastical corporations, had vanished\r\naway. In the place of the motley of privileges that had tempered the\r\nBourbon monarchy, in the place of the popular Assemblies of the Revolution,\r\nthere sprang up a series of magistracies as regular and as absolute as the\r\norders of military rank. [83] Where, under the Constitution of 1791, a body\r\nof local representatives had met to conduct the business of the Department,\r\nthere was now a Préfet, appointed by the First Consul, absolute, like the\r\nFirst Consul himself, and assisted only by the advice of a nominated\r\ncouncil, which met for one fortnight in the year. In subordination to the\r\nPréfet, an officer and similar council transacted the local business of the\r\nArrondissement. Even the 40,000 Maires with their communal councils were\r\nall appointed directly or indirectly by the Chief of the State. There\r\nexisted in France no authority that could repair a village bridge, or light\r\nthe streets of a town, but such as owed its appointment to the central\r\nGovernment. Nor was the power of the First Consul limited to the\r\nadministration. With the exception of the lowest and the highest members of\r\nthe judicature, he nominated all judges, and transferred them at his\r\npleasure to inferior or superior posts.\r\n\r\nSuch was the system which, based to a great extent upon the preferences of\r\nthe French people, fixed even more deeply in the national character the\r\nwillingness to depend upon an omnipresent, all-directing power. Through its\r\nrational order, its regularity, its command of the highest science and\r\nexperience, this system of government could not fail to confer great and\r\nrapid benefits upon the country. It has usually been viewed by the French\r\nthemselves as one of the finest creations of political wisdom. In\r\ncomparison with the self-government which then and long afterwards existed\r\nin England, the centralisation of France had all the superiority of\r\nprogress and intelligence over torpor and self-contradiction. Yet a heavy,\r\nan incalculable price is paid by every nation which for the sake of\r\nadministrative efficiency abandons its local liberties, and all that is\r\nbound up with their enjoyment. No practice in the exercise of public right\r\narmed a later generation of Frenchmen against the audacity of a common\r\nusurper: no immortality of youth secured the institutions framed by\r\nNapoleon against the weakness and corruption which at some period undermine\r\nall despotisms. The historian who has exhausted every term of praise upon\r\nthe political system of the Consulate lived to declare, as Chief of the\r\nState himself, that the first need of France was the decentralisation of\r\npower. [84]\r\n\r\n[State policy of Bonaparte.]\r\n\r\nAfter ten years of disquiet, it was impossible that any Government could be\r\nmore welcome to the French nation than one which proclaimed itself the\r\nrepresentative, not of party or of opinion, but of France itself. No\r\nsection of the nation had won a triumph in the establishment of the\r\nConsulate; no section had suffered a defeat. In his own elevation Bonaparte\r\nannounced the close of civil conflict. A Government had arisen which\r\nsummoned all to its service which would employ all, reward all, reconcile\r\nall. The earliest measures of the First Consul exhibited the policy of\r\nreconciliation by which he hoped to rally the whole of France to his side.\r\nThe law of hostages, under which hundreds of families were confined in\r\nretaliation for local Royalist disturbances, was repealed, and Bonaparte\r\nhimself went to announce their liberty to the prisoners in the Temple.\r\nGreat numbers of names were struck off the list of the emigrants, and the\r\nroad to pardon was subsequently opened to all who had not actually served\r\nagainst their country. In the selection of his officers of State, Bonaparte\r\nshowed the same desire to win men of all parties. Cambacérès, a regicide,\r\nwas made Second Consul; Lebrun, an old official of Louis XVI., became his\r\ncolleague. In the Ministries, in the Senate, and in the Council of State\r\nthe nation saw men of proved ability chosen from all callings in life and\r\nfrom all political ranks. No Government of France had counted among its\r\nmembers so many names eminent for capacity and experience. One quality\r\nalone was indispensable, a readiness to serve and to obey. In that\r\nintellectual greatness which made the combination of all the forces of\r\nFrance a familiar thought in Bonaparte's mind, there was none of the moral\r\ngenerosity which could pardon opposition to himself, or tolerate energy\r\nacting under other auspices than his own. He desired to see authority in\r\nthe best hands; he sought talent and promoted it, but on the understanding\r\nthat it took its direction from himself. Outside this limit ability was his\r\nenemy, not his friend; and what could not be caressed or promoted was\r\ntreated with tyrannical injustice. While Bonaparte boasted of the career\r\nthat he had thrown open to talent, he suppressed the whole of the\r\nindependent journalism of Paris, and banished Mme. de Stael, whose guests\r\ncontinued to converse, when they might not write, about liberty. Equally\r\npartial, equally calculated, was Bonaparte's indulgence towards the ancient\r\nenemies of the Revolution, the Royalists and the priests. He felt nothing\r\nof the old hatred of Paris towards the Vendean noble and the superstitious\r\nBreton; he offered his friendship to the stubborn Breton race, whose\r\nloyalty and piety he appreciated as good qualities in subjects; but failing\r\ntheir submission, he instructed his generals in the west of France to burn\r\ndown their villages, and to set a price upon the heads of their chiefs.\r\nJustice, tolerance, good faith, were things which had no being for\r\nBonaparte outside the circle of his instruments and allies.\r\n\r\n[France ceases to excite democracy abroad, but promotes equality under\r\nmonarchical systems.]\r\n\r\n[Effect of Bonaparte's autocracy outside France.]\r\n\r\nIn the foreign relations of France it was not possible for the most\r\nunscrupulous will to carry aggression farther than it had been already\r\ncarried; yet the elevation of Bonaparte deeply affected the fortunes of all\r\nthose States whose lot depended upon France. It was not only that a mind\r\naccustomed to regard all human things as objects for its own disposal now\r\ndirected an irresistible military force, but from the day when France\r\nsubmitted to Bonaparte, the political changes accompanying the advance of\r\nthe French armies took a different character. Belgium and Holland, the\r\nRhine Provinces, the Cisalpine, the Roman, and the Parthenopean Republics,\r\nhad all received, under whatever circumstances of wrong, at least the forms\r\nof popular sovereignty. The reality of power may have belonged to French\r\ngenerals and commissioners; but, however insincerely uttered, the call to\r\nfreedom excited hopes and aspirations which were not insincere themselves.\r\nThe Italian festivals of emancipation, the trees of liberty, the rhetoric\r\nof patriotic assemblies, had betrayed little enough of the instinct for\r\nself-government; but they marked a separation from the past; and the period\r\nbetween the years 1796 and 1799 was in fact the birth-time of those hopes\r\nwhich have since been realised in the freedom and the unity of Italy. So\r\nlong as France had her own tumultuous assemblies, her elections in the\r\nvillage and in the county-town, it was impossible for her to form republics\r\nbeyond the Alps without introducing at least some germ of republican\r\norganisation and spirit. But when all power was concentrated in a single\r\nman, when the spoken and the written word became an offence against the\r\nState, when the commotion of the old municipalities was succeeded by the\r\nsilence and the discipline of a body of clerks working round their chief,\r\nthen the advance of French influence ceased to mean the support of popular\r\nforces against the Governments. The form which Bonaparte had given to\r\nFrance was the form which he intended for the clients of France. Hence in\r\nthose communities which directly received the impress of the Consulate, as\r\nin Bavaria and the minor German States, authority, instead of being\r\noverthrown, was greatly strengthened. Bonaparte carried beyond the Rhine\r\nthat portion of the spirit of the Revolution which he accepted at home, the\r\nsuppression of privilege, the extinction of feudal rights, the reduction of\r\nall ranks to equality before the law, and the admission of all to the\r\npublic service. But this levelling of the social order in the client-states\r\nof France, and the establishment of system and unity in the place of\r\nobsolete privilege, cleared the way not for the supremacy of the people,\r\nbut for the supremacy of the Crown. The power which was taken away from\r\ncorporations, from knights, and from ecclesiastics, was given, not to a\r\npopular Representative, but to Cabinet Ministers and officials ranged after\r\nthe model of the official hierarchy of France. What the French had in the\r\nfirst epoch of their Revolution endeavoured to impart to Europe--the spirit\r\nof liberty and self-government--they had now renounced themselves. The\r\nbelief in popular right, which made the difference between the changes of\r\n1789 and those attempted by the Emperor Joseph, sank in the storms of the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\n[Bonaparte legislates in the spirit of the reforming monarchs of the 18th\r\ncentury.]\r\n\r\nYet the statesmanship of Bonaparte, if it repelled the liberal and\r\ndisinterested sentiment of 1789, was no mere cunning of a Corsican soldier,\r\nor exploit of mediæval genius born outside its age. Subject to the fullest\r\ngratification of his own most despotic or most malignant impulse, Bonaparte\r\ncarried into his creations the ideas upon which the greatest European\r\ninnovators before the French Revolution had based their work. What\r\nFrederick and Joseph had accomplished, or failed to accomplish, was\r\nrealised in Western Germany when its Sovereigns became the clients of the\r\nFirst Consul. Bonaparte was no child of the French Revolution; he was the\r\nlast and the greatest of the autocratic legislators who worked in an unfree\r\nage. Under his rule France lost what had seemed to be most its own; it most\r\npowerfully advanced the forms of progress common to itself and the rest of\r\nEurope. Bonaparte raised no population to liberty: in extinguishing\r\nprivilege and abolishing the legal distinctions of birth, in levelling all\r\npersonal and corporate authority beneath the single rule of the State, he\r\nprepared the way for a rational freedom, when, at a later day, the\r\nGovernment of the State should itself become the representative of the\r\nnation's will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nOvertures of Bonaparte to Austria and England--The War continues--Massena\r\nbesieged in Genoa--Moreau invades Southern Germany--Bonaparte crosses the\r\nSt. Bernard, and descends in the rear of the Austrians--Battle of\r\nMarengo--Austrians retire behind the Mincio--Treaty between England and\r\nAustria--Austria continues the War--Battle of Hohenlinden--Peace of\r\nLunéville--War between England and the Northern Maritime League--Battle of\r\nCopenhagen--Murder of Paul--End of the Maritime War--English Army enters\r\nEgypt--French defeated at Alexandria--They capitulate at Cairo and\r\nAlexandria--Preliminaries of Peace between England and France signed at\r\nLondon, followed by Peace of Amiens--Pitt's Irish Policy and his\r\nretirement--Debates on the Peace--Aggressions of Bonaparte during the\r\nContinental Peace--Holland, Italy, Switzerland--Settlement of Germany under\r\nFrench and Russian influence--Suppression of Ecclesiastical States and Free\r\nCities--Its effects--Stein--France under the Consulate--The Civil Code--The\r\nConcordat.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Overtures of Bonaparte to Austria and to England, 1799.]\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the Consulate gave France peace from the strife of\r\nparties. Peace from foreign warfare was not less desired by the nation; and\r\nalthough the First Consul himself was restlessly planning the next\r\ncampaign, it belonged to his policy to represent himself as the mediator\r\nbetween France and Europe. Discarding the usual diplomatic forms, Bonaparte\r\naddressed letters in his own name to the Emperor Francis and to King George\r\nIII., deploring the miseries inflicted by war upon nations naturally\r\nallied, and declaring his personal anxiety to enter upon negotiations for\r\npeace. The reply of Austria which was courteously worded, produced an offer\r\non the part of Bonaparte to treat for peace upon the basis of the Treaty of\r\nCampo Formio. Such a proposal was the best evidence of Bonaparte's real\r\nintentions. Austria had re-conquered Lombardy, and driven the armies of the\r\nRepublic from the Adige to within a few miles of Nice. To propose a peace\r\nwhich should merely restore the situation existing at the beginning of the\r\nwar was pure irony. The Austrian Government accordingly declared itself\r\nunable to treat without the concurrence of its allies. The answer of\r\nEngland to the overtures of the First Consul was rough and defiant. It\r\nrecounted the causes of war and distrust which precluded England from\r\nnegotiating with a revolutionary Government; and, though not insisting on\r\nthe restoration of the Bourbons as a condition of peace, it stated that no\r\nguarantee for the sincerity and good behaviour of France would be so\r\nacceptable to Great Britain as the recall of the ancient family. [85]\r\n\r\nFew State papers have been distinguished by worse faults of judgment than\r\nthis English manifesto. It was intended to recommend the Bourbons to France\r\nas a means of procuring peace: it enabled Bonaparte to represent England as\r\nviolently interfering with the rights of the French people, and the\r\nBourbons as seeking their restoration at the hand of the enemy of their\r\ncountry. The answer made to Pitt's Government from Paris was such as one\r\nhigh-spirited nation which had recently expelled its rulers might address\r\nto another that had expelled its rulers a century before. France, it was\r\nsaid, had as good a right to dismiss an incapable dynasty as Great Britain.\r\nIf Talleyrand's reply failed to convince King George that before restoring\r\nthe Bourbons he ought to surrender his own throne to the Stuarts, it\r\nsucceeded in transferring attention from the wrongs inflicted by France to\r\nthe pretensions advanced by England. That it affected the actual course of\r\nevents there is no reason to believe. The French Government was well\r\nacquainted with the real grounds of war possessed by England, in spite of\r\nthe errors by which the British Cabinet weakened the statement of its\r\ncause. What the mass of the French people now thought, or did not think,\r\nhad become a matter of very little importance.\r\n\r\n[Situation of the Armies.]\r\n\r\n[Moreau invades South Germany, April, 1800.]\r\n\r\nThe war continued. Winter and the early spring of 1800 passed in France\r\namidst vigorous but concealed preparations for the campaign which was to\r\ndrive the Austrians from Italy. In Piedmont the Austrians spent months in\r\ninaction, which might have given them Genoa and completed the conquest of\r\nItaly before Bonaparte's army could take the field. It was not until the\r\nbeginning of April that Melas, their general, assailed the French positions\r\non the Genoese Apennines; a fortnight more was spent in mountain warfare\r\nbefore Massena, who now held the French command, found himself shut up in\r\nGenoa and blockaded by land and sea. The army which Bonaparte was about to\r\nlead into Italy lay in between Dijon and Geneva, awaiting the arrival of\r\nthe First Consul. On the Rhine, from Strasburg to Schaffhausen, a force of\r\n100,000 men was ready to cross into Germany under the command of Moreau,\r\nwho was charged with the task of pushing the Austrians back from the Upper\r\nDanube, and so rendering any attack through Switzerland upon the\r\ncommunications of Bonaparte's Italian force impossible. Moreau's army was\r\nthe first to move. An Austrian force, not inferior to Moreau's own, lay\r\nwithin the bend of the Rhine that covers Baden and Würtemberg. Moreau\r\ncrossed the Rhine at various points, and by a succession of ingenious\r\nmanoeuvres led his adversary, Kray, to occupy all the roads through the\r\nBlack Forest except those by which the northern divisions of the French\r\nwere actually passing. A series of engagements, conspicuous for the skill\r\nof the French general and the courage of the defeated Austrians, gave\r\nMoreau possession of the country south of the Danube as far as Ulm, where\r\nKray took refuge in his entrenched camp. Beyond this point Moreau's\r\ninstructions forbade him to advance. His task was fulfilled by the\r\nseverance of the Austrian army from the roads into Italy.\r\n\r\n[Bonaparte crosses the Alps, May, 1800.]\r\n\r\nBonaparte's own army was now in motion. Its destination was still secret;\r\nits very existence was doubted by the Austrian generals. On the 8th of May\r\nthe First Consul himself arrived at Geneva, and assumed the command. The\r\ncampaign upon which this army was now entering was designed by Bonaparte to\r\nsurpass everything that Europe had hitherto seen most striking in war. The\r\nfeats of Massena and Suvaroff in the Alps had filled his imagination with\r\nmountain warfare. A victory over nature more imposing than theirs might, in\r\nthe present position of the Austrian forces in Lombardy, be made the\r\nprelude to a victory in the field without a parallel in its effects upon\r\nthe enemy. Instead of relieving Genoa by an advance along the coast-road,\r\nBonaparte intended to march across the Alps and to descend in the rear of\r\nthe Austrians. A single defeat would then cut the Austrians off from their\r\ncommunications with Mantua, and result either in the capitulation of their\r\narmy or in the evacuation of the whole of the country that they had won,\r\nBonaparte led his army into the mountains. The pass of the Great St.\r\nBernard, though not a carriage-road, offered little difficulty to a\r\ncommander supplied with every resource of engineering material and skill;\r\nand by this road the army crossed the Alps. The cannons were taken from\r\ntheir carriages and dragged up the mountain in hollowed trees; thousands of\r\nmules transported the ammunition and supplies; workshops for repairs were\r\nestablished on either slope of the mountain; and in the Monastery of St.\r\nBernard there were stores collected sufficient to feed the soldiers as they\r\nreached the summit during six successive days (May 15-20). The passage of\r\nthe St. Bernard was a triumph of organisation, foresight, and good\r\nmanagement; as a military exploit it involved none of the danger, none of\r\nthe suffering, none of the hazard, which gave such interest to the campaign\r\nof Massena and Suvaroff.\r\n\r\n[Bonaparte cuts off the Austrian army from Eastern Lombardy.]\r\n\r\nBonaparte had rightly calculated upon the unreadiness of his enemy. The\r\nadvanced guard of the French army poured down the valley of the Dora-Baltea\r\nupon the scanty Austrian detachments at Ivrea and Chiusella, before Melas,\r\nwho had in vain been warned of the departure of the French from Geneva,\r\narrived with a few thousand men at Turin to dispute the entrance into\r\nItaly. Melas himself, on the opening of the campaign, had followed a French\r\ndivision to Nice, leaving General Ott in charge of the army investing\r\nGenoa. On reaching Turin he discovered the full extent of his peril, and\r\nsent orders to Ott to raise the siege of Genoa and to join him with every\r\nregiment that he could collect. Ott, however, was unwilling to abandon the\r\nprey at this moment falling into his grasp. He remained stationary till the\r\n5th of June, when Massena, reduced to the most cruel extremities by famine,\r\nwas forced to surrender Genoa to the besiegers. But his obstinate endurance\r\nhad the full effect of a battle won. Ott's delay rendered Melas powerless\r\nto hinder the movements of Bonaparte, when, instead of marching upon Genoa,\r\nas both French and Austrians expected him to do, he turned eastward, and\r\nthrust his army between the Austrians and their own fortresses. Bonaparte\r\nhimself entered Milan (June 2); Lannes and Murat were sent to seize the\r\nbridges over the Po and the Adda. The Austrian detachment guarding Piacenza\r\nwas overpowered; the communications of Melas with the country north of the\r\nPowere completely severed. Nothing remained for the Austrian commander but\r\nto break through the French or to make his escape to Genoa.\r\n\r\n[Battle of Marengo, June 14, 1800.]\r\n\r\n[Conditions of Armistice.]\r\n\r\nThe French centre was now at Stradella, half-way between Piacenza and\r\nAlessandria. Melas was at length joined by Ott at Alessandria, but so\r\nscattered were the Austrian forces, that out of 80,000 men Melas had not\r\nmore than 33,000 at his command. Bonaparte's forces were equal in number;\r\nhis only fear was that Melas might use his last line of retreat, and escape\r\nto Genoa without an engagement. The Austrian general, however, who had\r\nshared with Suvaroff the triumph over Joubert at Novi, resolved to stake\r\neverything upon a pitched battle. He awaited Bonaparte's approach at\r\nAlessandria. On the 12th of June Bonaparte advanced westward from\r\nStradella. His anxiety lest Melas might be escaping from his hands\r\nincreased with every hour of the march that brought him no tidings of the\r\nenemy; and on the 13th, when his advanced guard had come almost up to the\r\nwalls of Alessandria without seeing an enemy, he could bear the suspense no\r\nlonger, and ordered Desaix to march southward towards Novi and hold the\r\nroad to Genoa. Desaix led off his division. Early the next morning the\r\nwhole army of Melas issued from Alessandria, and threw itself upon the\r\nweakened line of the French at Marengo. The attack carried everything\r\nbefore it: at the end of seven hours' fighting, Melas, exhausted by his\r\npersonal exertions, returned into Alessandria, and sent out tidings of a\r\ncomplete victory. It was at this moment that Desaix, who had turned at the\r\nsound of the cannon, appeared on the field, and declared that, although one\r\nbattle had been lost, another might be won. A sudden cavalry-charge struck\r\npanic into the Austrians, who believed the battle ended and the foe\r\noverthrown. Whole brigades threw down their arms and fled; and ere the day\r\nclosed a mass of fugitives, cavalry and infantry, thronging over the\r\nmarshes of the Bormida, was all that remained of the victorious Austrian\r\ncentre. The suddenness of the disaster, the desperate position of the army,\r\ncut off from its communications, overthrew the mind of Melas, and he agreed\r\nto an armistice more fatal than an unconditional surrender. The Austrians\r\nretired behind the Mincio, and abandoned to the French every fortress in\r\nNorthern Italy that lay west of that river. A single battle had produced\r\nthe result of a campaign of victories and sieges. Marengo was the most\r\nbrilliant in conception of all Bonaparte's triumphs. If in its execution\r\nthe genius of the great commander had for a moment failed him, no mention\r\nof the long hours of peril and confusion was allowed to obscure the\r\nsplendour of Bonaparte's victory. Every document was altered or suppressed\r\nwhich contained a report of the real facts of the battle. The descriptions\r\ngiven to the French nation claimed only new homage to the First Consul's\r\ninvincible genius and power. [86]\r\n\r\n[Austria continues the war.]\r\n\r\nAt Vienna the military situation was viewed more calmly than in Melas'\r\ncamp. The conditions of the armistice were generally condemned, and any\r\nsudden change in the policy of Austria was prevented by a treaty with\r\nEngland, binding Austria, in return for British subsidies, and for a secret\r\npromise of part of Piedmont, to make no separate peace with France before\r\nthe end of February, 1801. This treaty was signed a few hours before the\r\narrival of the news of Marengo. It was the work of Thugut, who still\r\nmaintained his influence over the Emperor, in spite of growing unpopularity\r\nand almost universal opposition. Public opinion, however, forced the\r\nEmperor at least to take steps for ascertaining the French terms of peace.\r\nAn envoy was sent to Paris; and, as there could be no peace without the\r\nconsent of England, conferences were held with the object of establishing a\r\nnaval armistice between England and France. England, however, refused the\r\nconcessions demanded by the First Consul; and the negotiations were broken\r\noff in September. But this interval of three months had weakened the\r\nauthority of the Minister and stimulated the intrigues which at every great\r\ncrisis paralysed the action of Austria. At length, while Thugut was\r\nreceiving the subsidies of Great Britain and arranging for the most\r\nvigorous prosecution of the war, the Emperor, concealing the transaction\r\nfrom his Minister, purchased a new armistice by the surrender of the\r\nfortresses of Ulm and Ingolstadt to Moreau's army. [87]\r\n\r\n[Battle of Hohenlinden, Dec. 3, 1800.]\r\n\r\nA letter written by Thugut after a council held on the 25th of September\r\ngives some indication of the stormy scene which then passed in the\r\nEmperor's presence. Thugut tendered his resignation, which was accepted;\r\nand Lehrbach, the author of the new armistice, was placed in office. But\r\nthe reproaches of the British ambassador forced the weak Emperor to rescind\r\nthis appointment on the day after it had been published to the world. There\r\nwas no one in Vienna capable of filling the vacant post; and after a short\r\ninterval the old Minister resumed the duties of his office, without,\r\nhowever, openly resuming the title. The remainder of the armistice was\r\nemployed in strengthening the force opposed to Moreau, who now received\r\norders to advance upon Vienna. The Archduke John, a royal strategist of\r\neighteen, was furnished with a plan for surrounding the French army and\r\ncutting it off from its communications. Moreau lay upon the Isar; the\r\nAustrians held the line of the Inn. On the termination of the armistice the\r\nAustrians advanced and made some devious marches in pursuance of the\r\nArchduke's enterprise, until a general confusion, attributed to the\r\nweather, caused them to abandon their manoeuvres and move straight against\r\nthe enemy. On the 3rd of December the Austrians plunged into the\r\nsnow-blocked roads of the Forest of Hohenlinden, believing that they had\r\nnothing near them but the rear-guard of a retiring French division. Moreau\r\nwaited until they had reached the heart of the forest, and then fell upon\r\nthem with his whole force in front, in flank, and in the rear. The defeat\r\nof the Austrians was overwhelming. What remained of the war was rather a\r\nchase than a struggle. Moreau successively crossed the Inn, the Salza, and\r\nthe Traun; and on December 25th the Emperor, seeing that no effort of Pitt\r\ncould keep Moreau out of Vienna, accepted an armistice at Steyer, and\r\nagreed to treat for peace without reference to Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Peace of Lunéville, Feb. 9, 1801.]\r\n\r\nDefeats on the Mincio, announced during the following days, increased the\r\nnecessity for peace. Thugut was finally removed from power. Some resistance\r\nwas offered to the conditions proposed by Bonaparte, but these were\r\ndirected more to the establishment of French influence in Germany than to\r\nthe humiliation of the House of Hapsburg. Little was taken from Austria but\r\nwhat she had surrendered at Campo Formio. It was not by the cession of\r\nItalian or Slavonic provinces that the Government of Vienna paid for\r\nMarengo and Hohenlinden, but at the cost of that divided German race whose\r\nmisfortune it was to have for its head a sovereign whose interests in the\r\nEmpire and in Germany were among the least of all his interests. The Peace\r\nof Lunéville, [88] concluded between France and the Emperor on the 9th of\r\nFebruary, 1801, without even a reference to the Diet of the Empire, placed\r\nthe minor States of Germany at the mercy of the French Republic. It left to\r\nthe House of Hapsburg the Venetian territory which it had gained in 1797;\r\nit required no reduction of the Hapsburg influence in Italy beyond the\r\nabdication of the Grand Duke of Tuscany; but it ceded to France, without\r\nthe disguises of 1797, the German provinces west of the Rhine, and it\r\nformally bound the Empire to compensate the dispossessed lay Sovereigns in\r\nsuch a manner as should be approved by France. The French Republic was thus\r\nmade arbiter, as a matter of right, in the rearrangement of the maimed and\r\nshattered Empire. Even the Grand Duke of Tuscany, like his predecessor in\r\nejection, the Duke of Modena, was to receive some portion of the German\r\nrace for his subjects, in compensation for the Italians taken from him. To\r\nsuch a pass had political disunion brought a nation which at that time\r\ncould show the greatest names in Europe in letters, in science, and in art.\r\n\r\n[Peace with Naples.]\r\n\r\n[Russia turns against England.]\r\n\r\n[Northern Maritime League, Dec., 1800.]\r\n\r\nAustria having succumbed, the Court of Naples, which had been the first of\r\nthe Allies to declare war, was left at the mercy of Bonaparte. Its\r\ncruelties and tyranny called for severe punishment; but the intercession of\r\nthe Czar kept the Bourbons upon the throne, and Naples received peace upon\r\nno harder condition than the exclusion of English vessels from its ports.\r\nEngland was now left alone in its struggle with the French Republic. Nor\r\nwas it any longer to be a struggle only against France and its\r\ndependencies. The rigour with which the English Government had used its\r\nsuperiority at sea, combined with the folly which it had shown in the\r\nAnglo-Russian attack upon Holland, raised against it a Maritime League\r\nunder the leadership of a Power which England had offended as a neutral and\r\nexasperated as an ally. Since the pitiful Dutch campaign, the Czar had\r\ntransferred to Great Britain the hatred which he had hitherto borne to\r\nFrance. The occasion was skilfully used by Bonaparte, to whom, as a\r\nsoldier, the Czar felt less repugnance than to the Government of advocates\r\nand contractors which he had attacked in 1799. The First Consul restored\r\nwithout ransom several thousands of Russian prisoners, for whom the\r\nAustrians and the English had refused to give up Frenchmen in exchange, and\r\nfollowed up this advance by proposing that the guardianship of Malta, which\r\nwas now blockaded by the English, should be given to the Czar. Paul had\r\ncaused himself to be made Grand Master of the Maltese Order of St. John of\r\nJerusalem. His vanity was touched by Bonaparte's proposal, and a friendly\r\nrelation was established between the French and Russian Governments.\r\nEngland, on the other hand, refused to place Malta under Russian\r\nguardianship, either before or after its surrender. This completed the\r\nbreach between the Courts of London and St. Petersburg. The Czar seized all\r\nthe English vessels in his ports and imprisoned their crews (Sept. 9). A\r\ndifference of long standing existed between England and the Northern\r\nMaritime Powers, which was capable at any moment of being made a cause of\r\nwar. The rights exercised over neutral vessels by English ships in time of\r\nhostilities, though good in international law, were so oppressive that, at\r\nthe time of the American rebellion, the Northern Powers had formed a\r\nleague, known as the Armed Neutrality, for the purpose of resisting by\r\nforce the interference of the English with neutral merchantmen upon the\r\nhigh seas. Since the outbreak of war with France, English vessels had again\r\npushed the rights of belligerents to extremes. The Armed Neutrality of 1780\r\nwas accordingly revived under the auspices of the Czar. The League was\r\nsigned on the 16th of December, 1800, by Russia, Sweden, and Denmark. Some\r\ndays later Prussia gave in its adhesion. [89]\r\n\r\n[Points at issue.]\r\n\r\nThe points at issue between Great Britain and the Neutrals were such as\r\narise between a great naval Power intent upon ruining its adversary and\r\nthat larger part of the world which remains at peace and desires to carry\r\non its trade with as little obstruction as possible. It was admitted on all\r\nsides that a belligerent may search a neutral vessel in order to ascertain\r\nthat it is not conveying contraband of war, and that a neutral vessel,\r\nattempting to enter a blockaded port, renders itself liable to forfeiture;\r\nbut beyond these two points everything was in dispute. A Danish ship\r\nconveys a cargo of wine from a Bordeaux merchant to his agent in New York.\r\nIs the wine liable to be seized in the mid-Atlantic by an English cruiser,\r\nto the destruction of the Danish carrying-trade, or is the Danish flag to\r\nprotect French property from a Power whose naval superiority makes capture\r\nupon the high seas its principal means of offence? England announces that a\r\nFrench port is in a state of blockade. Is a Swedish vessel, stopped while\r\nmaking for the port in question, to be considered a lawful prize, when, if\r\nit had reached the port, it would as a matter of fact have found no real\r\nblockade in existence? A Russian cargo of hemp, pitch, and timber is\r\nintercepted by an English vessel on its way to an open port in France. Is\r\nthe staple produce of the Russian Empire to lose its market as contraband\r\nof war? Or is an English man-of-war to allow material to pass into France,\r\nwithout which the repair of French vessels of war would be impossible?\r\n\r\n[War between England and the Northern Maritime Powers, Jan., 1801.]\r\n\r\nThese were the questions raised as often as a firm of shipowners in a\r\nneutral country saw their vessel come back into port cleared of its cargo,\r\nor heard that it was lying in the Thames awaiting the judgment of the\r\nAdmiralty Court. Great Britain claimed the right to seize all French\r\nproperty, in whatever vessel it might be sailing, and to confiscate, as\r\ncontraband of war, not only muskets, gunpowder, and cannon, but wheat, on\r\nwhich the provisioning of armies depended, and hemp, pitch, iron, and\r\ntimber, out of which the navies of her adversary were formed. The Neutrals,\r\non the other hand, demanded that a neutral flag should give safe passage to\r\nall goods on board, not being contraband of war; that the presence of a\r\nvessel of State as convoy should exempt merchantmen from search; that no\r\nport should be considered in a state of blockade unless a competent\r\nblockading force was actually in front of it; and that contraband of war\r\nshould include no other stores than those directly available for battle.\r\nConsiderations of reason and equity may be urged in support of every\r\npossible theory of the rights of belligerents and neutrals; but the theory\r\nof every nation has, as a matter of fact, been that which at the time\r\naccorded with its own interests. When a long era of peace had familiarised\r\nGreat Britain with the idea that in the future struggles of Europe it was\r\nmore likely to be a spectator than a belligerent, Great Britain accepted\r\nthe Neutrals' theory of international law at the Congress of Paris in 1856;\r\nbut in 1801, when the lot of England seemed to be eternal warfare, any\r\nlimitation of the rights of a belligerent appeared to every English jurist\r\nto contradict the first principles of reason. Better to add a general\r\nmaritime war to the existing difficulties of the country than to abandon\r\nthe exercise of its naval superiority in crippling the commerce of an\r\nadversary. The Declaration of armed Neutrality, announcing the intention of\r\nthe Allied Powers to resist the seizure of French goods on board their own\r\nmerchantmen, was treated in this country as a declaration of war. The\r\nGovernment laid an embargo upon all vessels of the allied neutrals lying in\r\nEnglish ports (Jan. 14th, 1801), and issued a swarm of privateers against\r\nthe trading ships making for the Baltic. Negotiations failed to lower the\r\ndemands of either side, and England prepared to deal with the navies of\r\nRussia, Denmark, Sweden, and Prussia.\r\n\r\n[Battle of Copenhagen, April 2, 1801.]\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the concentrated naval strength of England made it more than\r\na match for its adversaries. A fleet of seventeen ships of the line sailed\r\nfrom Yarmouth on the 12th of March, under the command of Parker and Nelson,\r\nwith orders to coerce the Danes and to prevent the junction of the\r\nconfederate navies. The fleet reached the Sound. The Swedish batteries\r\ncommanding the Sound failed to open fire. Nelson kept to the eastern side\r\nof the channel, and brought his ships safely past the storm of shot poured\r\nupon them from the Danish guns at Elsinore. He appeared before Copenhagen\r\nat mid-day on the 30th of March. Preparations for resistance were made by\r\nthe Danes with extraordinary spirit and resolution. The whole population of\r\nCopenhagen volunteered for service on the ships, the forts, and the\r\nfloating batteries. Two days were spent by the English in exploring the\r\nshallows of the channel; on the morning of the 2nd of April Nelson led his\r\nships into action in front of the harbour. Three ran aground; the Danish\r\nfire from land and sea was so violent that after some hours Admiral Parker,\r\nwho watched the engagement from the mid-channel, gave the signal of recall.\r\nNelson laughed at the signal, and continued the battle. In another hour the\r\nsix Danish men-of-war and the whole of the floating batteries were disabled\r\nor sunk. The English themselves had suffered most severely from a\r\nresistance more skilful and more determined than anything that they had\r\nexperienced from the French, and Nelson gladly offered a truce as soon as\r\nhis own victory was assured. The truce was followed by negotiation, and the\r\nnegotiation by an armistice for fourteen weeks, a term which Nelson\r\nconsidered sufficient to enable him to visit and to overthrow the navies of\r\nSweden and Russia.\r\n\r\n[Murder of Paul, March 23.]\r\n\r\n[Peace between England and the Northern Powers.]\r\n\r\nBut an event had already occurred more momentous in its bearing upon the\r\nNorthern Confederacy than the battle of Copenhagen itself. On the night of\r\nthe 23rd of March the Czar of Russia was assassinated in his palace. Paul's\r\ntyrannical violence, and his caprice verging upon insanity, had exhausted\r\nthe patience of a court acquainted with no mode of remonstrance but\r\nhomicide. Blood-stained hands brought to the Grand Duke Alexander the crown\r\nwhich he had consented to receive after a pacific abdication. Alexander\r\nimmediately reversed the policy of his father, and sent friendly\r\ncommunications both to the Government at London and to the commander of the\r\nBritish fleet in the Baltic. The maintenance of commerce with England was\r\nin fact more important to Russia than the protection of its carrying trade.\r\nNelson's attack was averted. A compromise was made between the two\r\nGovernments, which saved Russia's interests, without depriving England of\r\nits chief rights against France. The principles of the Armed Neutrality\r\nwere abandoned by the Government of St. Petersburg in so far as they\r\nrelated to the protection of an enemy's goods by the neutral flag. Great\r\nBritain continued to seize French merchandise on board whatever craft it\r\nmight be found; but it was stipulated that the presence of a ship of war\r\nshould exempt neutral vessels from search by privateers, and that no port\r\nshould be considered as in a state of blockade unless a reasonable\r\nblockading force was actually in front of it. The articles condemned as\r\ncontraband were so limited as not to include the flax, hemp, and timber, on\r\nwhose export the commerce of Russia depended. With these concessions the\r\nCzar was easily brought to declare Russia again neutral. The minor Powers\r\nof the Baltic followed the example of St. Petersburg; and the naval\r\nconfederacy which had threatened to turn the balance in the conflict\r\nbetween England and the French Republic left its only trace in the\r\nundeserved suffering of Denmark.\r\n\r\n[Affairs in Egypt.]\r\n\r\nEight years of warfare had left France unassailable in Western Europe, and\r\nEngland in command of every sea. No Continental armies could any longer be\r\nraised by British subsidies: the navies of the Baltic, with which Bonaparte\r\nhad hoped to meet England on the seas, lay at peace in their ports. Egypt\r\nwas now the only arena remaining where French and English combatants could\r\nmeet, and the dissolution of the Northern Confederacy had determined the\r\nfate of Egypt by leaving England in undisputed command of the approach to\r\nEgypt by sea. The French army, vainly expecting reinforcements, and\r\nattacked by the Turks from the east, was caught in a trap. Soon after the\r\ndeparture of Bonaparte from Alexandria, his successor, General Kleber, had\r\naddressed a report to the Directory, describing the miserable condition of\r\nthe force which Bonaparte had chosen to abandon. The report was intercepted\r\nby the English, and the Government immediately determined to accept no\r\ncapitulation which did not surrender the whole of the French army as\r\nprisoners of war. An order to this effect was sent to the Mediterranean.\r\nBefore, however, the order reached Sir Sidney Smith, the English admiral\r\nco-operating with the Turks, an agreement had been already signed by him at\r\nEl Arish, granting Kleber's army a free return to France (Feb. 24, 1800).\r\nAfter Kleber, in fulfilment of the conditions of the treaty, had withdrawn\r\nhis troops from certain positions, Sir Sidney Smith found himself compelled\r\nto inform the French General that in the negotiations of El Arish he had\r\nexceeded his powers, and that the British Government insisted upon the\r\nsurrender of the French forces. Kleber replied by instantly giving battle\r\nto the Turks at Heliopolis, and putting to the rout an army six times as\r\nnumerous as his own. The position of the French seemed to be growing\r\nstronger in Egypt, and the prospect of a Turkish re-conquest more doubtful,\r\nwhen the dagger of a fanatic robbed the French of their able chief, and\r\ntransferred the command to General Menou, one of the very few French\r\nofficers of marked incapacity who held command at any time during the war.\r\nThe British Government, as soon as it learnt what had taken place between\r\nKleber and Sir Sidney Smith, declared itself willing to be bound by the\r\nconvention of El Arish. The offer was, however, rejected by the French. It\r\nwas clear that the Turks could never end the war by themselves; and the\r\nBritish Ministry at last came to understand that Egypt must be re-conquered\r\nby English arms.\r\n\r\n[English army lands in Egypt, March, 1801.]\r\n\r\n[French capitulate at Cairo, June 27, 1801.]\r\n\r\n[And at Alexandria, Aug. 30.]\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of March, 1801, a corps of 17,000 men, led by Sir Ralph\r\nAbercromby, landed at Aboukir Bay. According to the plan of the British\r\nGovernment, Abercromby's attack was to be supported by a Turkish corps from\r\nSyria, and by an Anglo-Indian division brought from Ceylon to Kosseir, on\r\nthe Red Sea. The Turks and the Indian troops were, however, behind their\r\ntime, and Abercromby opened the campaign alone. Menou had still 27,000\r\ntroops at his disposal. Had he moved up with the whole of his army from\r\nCairo, he might have destroyed the English immediately after their landing.\r\nInstead of doing so, he allowed weak isolated detachments of the French to\r\nsink before superior numbers. The English had already gained confidence of\r\nvictory when Menou advanced in some force in order to give battle in front\r\nof Alexandria. The decisive engagement took place on the 21st of March. The\r\nFrench were completely defeated. Menou, however, still refused to\r\nconcentrate his forces; and in the course of a few weeks 13,000 French\r\ntroops which had been left behind at Cairo were cut off from communication\r\nwith the rest of the army. A series of attempts made by Admiral Ganteaume\r\nto land reinforcements from France ended fruitlessly. Towards the end of\r\nJune the arrival of a Turkish force enabled the English to surround the\r\nFrench in Cairo. The circuit of the works was too large to be successfully\r\ndefended; on the other hand, the English were without the heavy artillery\r\nnecessary for a siege. Under these circumstances the terms which had\r\noriginally been offered at El Arish were again proposed to General Belliard\r\nfor himself and the army of Cairo. They were accepted, and Cairo was\r\nsurrendered to the English on condition that the garrison should be\r\nconveyed back to France (June 27). Soon after the capitulation General\r\nBaird reached Lower Egypt with an Anglo-Indian division. Menou with the\r\nremainder of the French army was now shut up in Alexandria. His forts and\r\noutworks were successively carried; his flotilla was destroyed; and when\r\nall hope of support from France had been abandoned, the army of Alexandria,\r\nwhich formed the remnant of the troops with which Bonaparte had won his\r\nearliest victories in Italy, found itself compelled to surrender the last\r\nstronghold of the French in Egypt (Aug. 30). It was the first important\r\nsuccess which had been gained by English soldiers over the troops of the\r\nRepublic; the first campaign in which English generalship had permitted the\r\narmy to show itself in its true quality.\r\n\r\n[Negotiations for peace.]\r\n\r\n[Preliminaries of London, Oct. 1, 1801.]\r\n\r\n[Peace of Amiens, March 27, 1802.]\r\n\r\nPeace was now at hand. Soon after the Treaty of Lunéville had withdrawn\r\nAustria from the war, unofficial negotiations had begun between the\r\nGovernments of Great Britain and France. The object with which Pitt had\r\nentered upon the war, the maintenance of the old European system against\r\nthe aggression of France, was now seen to be one which England must\r\nabandon. England had borne its share in the defence of the Continent. If\r\nthe Continental Powers could no longer resist the ascendancy of a single\r\nState, England could not struggle for the Balance of Power alone. The\r\nnegotiations of 1801 had little in common with those of 1796. Belgium,\r\nwhich had been the burden of all Pitt's earlier despatches, no longer\r\nfigured as an object of contention. The frontier of the Rhine, with the\r\nvirtual possession of Holland and Northern Italy, under the title of the\r\nBatavian, Ligurian, and Cisalpine Republics, was tacitly conceded to\r\nFrance. In place of the restoration of the Netherlands, the negotiators of\r\n1801 argued about the disposal of Egypt, of Malta, and of the colonies\r\nwhich Great Britain had conquered from France and its allies. Events\r\ndecided the fate of Egypt. The restoration of Malta to the Knights of St.\r\nJohn was strenuously demanded by France, and not refused by England. It was\r\nin relation to the colonial claims of France that the two Governments found\r\nit most difficult to agree. Great Britain, which had lost no territory\r\nitself, had conquered nearly all the Asiatic and Atlantic colonies of the\r\nFrench Republic and of its Dutch and Spanish allies. In return for the\r\nrestoration of Ceylon, the Cape of Good Hope, Guiana, Trinidad, and various\r\nEast and West Indian settlements, France had nothing to offer to Great\r\nBritain but peace. If peace, however, was to be made, the only possible\r\nsettlement was by means of a compromise; and it was finally agreed that\r\nEngland should retain Ceylon and Trinidad, and restore the rest of the\r\ncolonies which it had taken from France, Spain, and Holland. Preliminaries\r\nof peace embodying these conditions were signed at London on the 1st of\r\nOctober, 1801. Hostilities ceased; but an interval of several months\r\nbetween the preliminary agreement and the conclusion of the final treaty\r\nwas employed by Bonaparte in new usurpations upon the Continent, to which\r\nhe forced the British Government to lend a kind of sanction in the\r\ncontinuance of the negotiations. The Government, though discontented, was\r\nunwilling to treat these acts as new occasions of war. The conferences were\r\nat length brought to a close, and the definitive treaty between France and\r\nGreat Britain was signed at Amiens on the 27th of March, 1802. [90]\r\n\r\n[Pitt's retirement. Its cause.]\r\n\r\n[Union of Ireland and Great Britain, 1800.]\r\n\r\nThe Minister who, since the first outbreak of war, had so resolutely\r\nstruggled for the freedom of Europe, was no longer in power when Great\r\nBritain entered into negotiations with the First Consul. In the same week\r\nthat Austria signed the Peace of Lunéville, Pitt had retired from office.\r\nThe catastrophe which dissolved his last Continental alliance may possibly\r\nhave disposed Pitt to make way for men who could treat for peace with a\r\nbetter grace than himself, but the immediate cause of his retirement was an\r\naffair of internal policy. Among the few important domestic measures which\r\nPitt had not sacrificed to foreign warfare was a project for the\r\nLegislative Union of Great Britain and Ireland. Ireland had up to this time\r\npossessed a Parliament nominally independent of that of Great Britain. Its\r\npopulation, however, was too much divided to create a really national\r\ngovernment; and, even if the internal conditions of the country had been\r\nbetter, the practical sovereignty of Great Britain must at that time have\r\nprevented the Parliament of Dublin from being more than an agency of\r\nministerial corruption. It was the desire of Pitt to give to Ireland, in\r\nthe place of a fictitious independence, that real participation in the\r\npolitical life of Great Britain which has more than recompensed Scotland\r\nand Wales for the loss of separate nationality. As an earnest of\r\nlegislative justice, Pitt gave hopes to the leaders of the Irish Catholic\r\nparty that the disabilities which excluded Roman Catholics from the House\r\nof Commons and from many offices in the public service would be no longer\r\nmaintained. On this understanding the Catholics of Ireland abstained from\r\noffering to Pitt's project a resistance which would probably have led to\r\nits failure. A majority of members in the Protestant Parliament of Dublin\r\naccepted the price which the Ministry offered for their votes. A series of\r\nresolutions in favour of the Legislative Union of the two countries was\r\ntransmitted to England in the spring of 1800; the English Parliament passed\r\nthe Act of Union in the same summer; and the first United Parliament of\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland assembled in London at the beginning of the year\r\n1801.\r\n\r\n[Pitt desires to emancipate the Catholics.]\r\n\r\n[Pitt resigns Feb. 1801.]\r\n\r\n[Addington Minister.]\r\n\r\nPitt now prepared to fulfil his virtual promise to the Irish Catholics. A\r\nmeasure obliterating the ancient lines of civil and religious enmity, and\r\ncalling to public life a class hitherto treated as alien and hostile to the\r\nState, would have been in true consonance with all that was best in Pitt's\r\nown statesmanship. But the ignorant bigotry of King George III. was excited\r\nagainst him by men who hated every act of justice or tolerance to Roman\r\nCatholics; and it proved of greater force than the genius of the Minister.\r\nThe old threat of the King's personal enmity was publicly addressed to\r\nPitt's colleague, Dundas, when the proposal for Catholic emancipation was\r\nunder discussion in the Cabinet; and, with a just regard for his own\r\ndignity, Pitt withdrew from office (Feb. 5, 1801), unable to influence a\r\nSovereign who believed his soul to be staked on the letter of the\r\nCoronation Oath. The ablest members of Pitt's government, Grenville,\r\nDundas, and Windham, retired with their leader. Addington, Speaker of the\r\nHouse of Commons, became Prime Minister, with colleagues as undistinguished\r\nas himself. It was under the government of Addington that the negotiations\r\nwere begun which resulted in the signature of Preliminaries of Peace in\r\nOctober 1801.\r\n\r\n[The Peace of 1801.]\r\n\r\nPitt himself supported the new Ministry in their policy of peace;\r\nGrenville, lately Pitt's Foreign Minister, unsparingly condemned both the\r\ncession of the conquered colonies and the policy of granting France peace\r\non any terms whatever. Viewed by the light of our own knowledge of events,\r\nthe Peace of 1801 appears no more than an unprofitable break in an\r\ninevitable war; and perhaps even then the signs of Bonaparte's ambition\r\njustified those who, like Grenville, urged the nation to give no truce to\r\nFrance, and to trust to Bonaparte's own injustice to raise us up allies\r\nupon the Continent. But, for the moment, peace seemed at least worth a\r\ntrial. The modes of prosecuting a war of offence were exhausted; the cost\r\nof the national defence remained the same. There were no more navies to\r\ndestroy, no more colonies to seize; the sole means of injuring the enemy\r\nwas by blockading his ports, and depriving him of his maritime commerce. On\r\nthe other hand, the possibility of a French invasion required the\r\nmaintenance of an enormous army and militia in England, and prevented any\r\ngreat reduction in the expenses of the war, which had already added two\r\nhundred millions to the National Debt. Nothing was lost by making peace,\r\nexcept certain colonies and military positions which few were anxious to\r\nretain. The argument that England could at any moment recover what she now\r\nsurrendered was indeed a far sounder one than most of those which went to\r\nprove that the positions in question were of no real service. Yet even on\r\nthe latter point there was no want of high authority. It was Nelson himself\r\nwho assured the House of Lords that neither Malta nor the Cape of Good Hope\r\ncould ever be of importance to Great Britain. [91] In the face of such\r\ntestimony, the men who lamented that England should allow the adversary to\r\nrecover any lost ground in the midst of a struggle for life or death,\r\npassed for obstinate fanatics. The Legislature reflected the general\r\nfeeling of the nation; and the policy of the Government was confirmed in\r\nthe Lords and the Commons by majorities of ten to one.\r\n\r\n[Aggressions of Bonaparte during the Continental peace.]\r\n\r\n[Holland, Sept., 1801.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Ministry of Addington had acted with energy both in Egypt and\r\nin the Baltic, it was generally felt that Pitt's retirement marked the\r\nsurrender of that resolute policy which had guided England since 1793. When\r\nonce the Preliminaries of Peace had been signed in London, Bonaparte\r\nrightly judged that Addington would waive many just causes of complaint,\r\nrather than break off the negotiations which were to convert the\r\nPreliminaries into a definitive treaty. Accordingly, in his instructions to\r\nJoseph Bonaparte, who represented France at the conferences held at Amiens,\r\nthe First Consul wrote, through Talleyrand, as follows:--\"You are forbidden\r\nto entertain any proposition relating to the King of Sardinia, or to the\r\nStadtholder, or to the internal affairs of Batavia, of Helvetia, or the\r\nRepublic of Italy. None of these subjects have anything to do with the\r\ndiscussions of England.\" The list of subjects excluded from the\r\nconsideration of England was the list of aggressions by which Bonaparte\r\nintended to fill up the interval of Continental peace. In the Treaty of\r\nLunéville, the independence of the newly-established republics in Holland,\r\nSwitzerland, and Italy had been recognised by France. The restoration of\r\nPiedmont to the House of Savoy had been the condition on which the Czar\r\nmade peace. But on every one of these points the engagements of France were\r\nmade only to be broken. So far from bringing independence to the\r\nclient-republics of France, the peace of Lunéville was but the introduction\r\nto a series of changes which brought these States directly into the hands\r\nof the First Consul. The establishment of absolute government in France\r\nitself entailed a corresponding change in each of its dependencies, and the\r\ncreation of an executive which should accept the First Consul's orders with\r\nas little question as the Prefect of a French department. Holland received\r\nits new constitution while France was still at war with England. The\r\nexisting Government and Legislature of the Batavian Republic were dissolved\r\n(Sept., 1801), and replaced by a council of twelve persons, each holding\r\nthe office of President in turn for a period of three months, and by a\r\nlegislature of thirty-five, which met only for a few days in the year. The\r\npower given to the new President during his office was enough, and not more\r\nthan enough, to make him an effective servant: a three-months' Minister and\r\nan Assembly that met and parted at the word of command were not likely to\r\nenter into serious rivalry with the First Consul. The Dutch peaceably\r\naccepted the constitution thus forced upon them; they possessed no means of\r\nresistance, and their affairs excited but little interest upon the\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\n[Bonaparte made President of the Italian Republic, Jan., 1802.]\r\n\r\n[Piedmont annexed to France, Sept., 1802.]\r\n\r\nFar more striking was the revolution next effected by the First Consul. In\r\nobedience to orders sent from Paris to the Legislature of the Cisalpine\r\nRepublic, a body of four hundred and fifty Italian representatives crossed\r\nthe Alps in the middle of winter in order to meet the First Consul at\r\nLyons, and to deliberate upon a constitution for the Cisalpine Republic.\r\nThe constitution had, as a matter of fact, been drawn up by Talleyrand, and\r\nsent to the Legislature at Milan some months before. But it was not for the\r\nsake of Italy that its representatives were collected at Lyons, in the\r\npresence of the First Consul, with every circumstance of national\r\nsolemnity. It was the most striking homage which Bonaparte could exact from\r\na foreign race in the face of all France; it was the testimony that other\r\nlands besides France desired Bonaparte to be their sovereign. When all the\r\nminor offices in the new Cisalpine Constitution had been filled, the\r\nItalians learnt that the real object of the convocation was to place the\r\nsceptre in Bonaparte's hands. They accepted the part which they found\r\nthemselves forced to play, and offered to the First Consul the presidency\r\nof the Cisalpine State (Jan. 25, 1802). Unlike the French Consulate, the\r\nchief magistracy in the new Cisalpine Constitution might be prolonged\r\nbeyond the term of ten years. Bonaparte had practically won the Crown of\r\nLombardy; and he had given to France the example of a submission more\r\nunqualified than its own. A single phrase rewarded the people who had thus\r\nplaced themselves in his hands. The Cisalpine Republic was allowed to\r\nassume the name of Italian Republic. The new title indicated the national\r\nhopes which had sprung up in Italy during the past ten years; it indicated\r\nno real desire on the part of Bonaparte to form either a free or a united\r\nItalian nation. In the Cisalpine State itself, although a good\r\nadministration and the extinction of feudal privileges made Bonaparte's\r\ngovernment acceptable, patriots who asked for freedom ran the risk of exile\r\nor imprisonment. What further influence was exercised by France upon\r\nItalian soil was not employed for the consolidation of Italy. Tuscany was\r\nbestowed by Bonaparte upon the Spanish Prince of Parma, and controlled by\r\nagents of the First Consul. Piedmont, which had long been governed by\r\nFrench generals, was at length definitely annexed to France.\r\n\r\n[Intervention in Switzerland.]\r\n\r\n[Bonaparte Mediator of the Helvetic League, Oct. 4, 1802.]\r\n\r\nSwitzerland had not, like the Cisalpine Republic, derived its liberty from\r\nthe victories of French armies, nor could Bonaparte claim the presidency of\r\nthe Helvetic State under the title of its founder. The struggles of the\r\nSwiss parties, however, placed the country at the mercy of France. Since\r\nthe expulsion of the Austrians by Massena in 1799, the antagonism between\r\nthe Democrats of the town and the Federalists of the Forest Cantons had\r\nbroken out afresh. A French army still occupied Switzerland; the Minister\r\nof the First Consul received instructions to interfere with all parties and\r\nconsolidate none. In the autumn of 1801, the Federalists were permitted to\r\ndissolve the central Helvetic Government, which had been created by the\r\nDirectory in 1798. One change followed another, until, on the 19th of May,\r\n1802, a second Constitution was proclaimed, based, like that of 1798, on\r\ncentralising and democratic principles, and almost extinguishing the old\r\nlocal independence of the members of the Swiss League. No sooner had French\r\npartisans created this Constitution, which could only be maintained by\r\nforce against the hostility of Berne and the Forest Cantons, than the\r\nFrench army quitted Switzerland. Civil war instantly broke out, and in the\r\ncourse of a few weeks the Government established by the French had lost all\r\nSwitzerland except the Pays de Vaud. This was the crisis for which\r\nBonaparte had been waiting. On the 4th of October a proclamation appeared\r\nat Lausanne, announcing that the First Consul had accepted the office of\r\nMediator of the Helvetic League. A French army entered Switzerland.\r\nFifty-six deputies from the cantons were summoned to Paris; and, in the\r\nbeginning of 1803, a new Constitution, which left the central Government\r\npowerless in the hands of France and reduced the national sovereignty to\r\ncantonal self-administration, placed Switzerland on a level with the\r\nBatavian and the Cisalpine dependencies of Bonaparte. The Rhone Valley,\r\nwith the mountains crossed by the new road over the Simplon, was converted\r\ninto a separate republic under the title of La Valais. The new chief\r\nmagistrate of the Helvetic Confederacy entered upon his office with a\r\npension paid out of Bonaparte's secret police fund.\r\n\r\n[Settlement of Germany.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the nature of the independence which the Peace of Lunéville gave\r\nto Holland, to Northern Italy, and to Switzerland. The re-organisation of\r\nGermany, which was provided for by the same treaty, affected larger\r\ninterests, and left more permanent traces upon European history. In the\r\nprovinces ceded to France lay the territory of the ancient ecclesiastical\r\nprinces of the empire, the Electors of Mainz, Cologne, and Trèves; but,\r\nbesides these spiritual sovereigns, a variety of secular potentates,\r\nranging from the Elector Palatine, with 600,000 subjects, to the Prince of\r\nWiedrunkel, with a single village, owned territory upon the left bank of\r\nthe Rhine; and for the dispossessed lay princes new territories had now to\r\nbe formed by the destruction of other ecclesiastical States in the interior\r\nof Germany. Affairs returned to the state in which they had stood in 1798,\r\nand the comedy of Rastadt was renewed at the point where it had been broken\r\noff: the only difference was that the French statesmen who controlled the\r\npartition of ecclesiastical Germany now remained in Paris, instead of\r\ncoming to the Rhine, to run the risk of being murdered by Austrian hussars.\r\nScarcely was the Treaty of Lunéville signed when the whole company of\r\nintriguers who had touted at Rastadt posted off to the French capital with\r\ntheir maps and their money-bags, the keener for the work when it became\r\nknown that by common consent the Free Cities of the Empire were now to be\r\nthrown into the spoil. Talleyrand and his confidant Mathieu had no occasion\r\nto ask for bribes, or to manoeuvre for the position of arbiters in Germany.\r\nThey were overwhelmed with importunities. Solemn diplomatists of the old\r\nschool toiled up four flights of stairs to the office of the needy\r\nsecretary, or danced attendance at the parties of the witty Minister. They\r\nhugged Talleyrand's poodle; they vied with one another in gaining a smile\r\nfrom the child whom he brought up at his house. [92] The shrewder of them\r\nfortified their attentions with solid bargains, and made it their principal\r\ncare not to be outbidden at the auction. Thus the game was kept up as long\r\nas there was a bishopric or a city in the market.\r\n\r\nThis was the real process of the German re-organisation. A pretended one\r\nwas meanwhile enacted by the Diet of Ratisbon. The Diet deliberated during\r\nthe whole of the summer of 1801 without arriving at a single resolution.\r\nNot even the sudden change of Russian policy that followed the death of the\r\nEmperor Paul and deprived Bonaparte of the support of the Northern Maritime\r\nLeague, could stimulate the German Powers to united action. The old\r\nantagonism of Austria and Prussia paralysed the Diet. Austria sought a\r\nGerman indemnity for the dethroned Grand Duke of Tuscany; Prussia aimed at\r\nextending its influence into Southern Germany by the annexation of Würzburg\r\nand Bamberg. Thus the summer of 1801 was lost in interminable debate, until\r\nBonaparte regained the influence over Russia which he had held before the\r\ndeath of Paul, and finally set himself free from all check and restraint by\r\nconcluding peace with England.\r\n\r\n[German policy of Bonaparte.]\r\n\r\nNo part of Bonaparte's diplomacy was more ably conceived or more likely to\r\nresult in a permanent empire than that which affected the secondary States\r\nof Germany. The rivalry of Austria and Prussia, the dread of Austrian\r\naggression felt in Bavaria, the grotesque ambition of the petty sovereigns\r\nof Baden and Würtemburg, were all understood and turned to account in the\r\npolicy which from this time shaped the French protectorate beyond the\r\nRhine. Bonaparte intended to give to Prussia such an increase of territory\r\nupon the Baltic as should counterbalance the power of Austria; and for this\r\npurpose he was willing to sacrifice Hanover or Mecklenburg: but he forbade\r\nPrussia's extension to the south. Austria, so far from gaining new\r\nterritory in Bavaria, was to be deprived of its own outlying possessions in\r\nWestern Germany, and excluded from all influence in this region. Bavaria,\r\ndependent upon French protection against Austria, was to be greatly\r\nstrengthened. Baden and Würtemberg, enriched by the spoil of little\r\nsovereignties, of Bishoprics and Free Cities, were to look to France for\r\nfurther elevation and aggrandisement. Thus, while two rival Powers balanced\r\none another upon the Baltic and the Lower Danube, the sovereigns of central\r\nand western Germany, owing everything to the Power that had humbled\r\nAustria, would find in submission to France the best security for their own\r\ngains, and the best protection against their more powerful neighbours.\r\n\r\n[Treaty between France and Russia for joint action in Germany, Oct. 11,\r\n1801.]\r\n\r\nOne condition alone could have frustrated a policy agreeable to so many\r\ninterests, namely, the existence of a national sentiment among the Germans\r\nthemselves. But the peoples of Germany cared as little about a Fatherland\r\nas their princes. To the Hessian and the Bavarian at the centre of the\r\nEmpire, Germany was scarcely more than it was to the Swiss or the Dutch,\r\nwho had left the Empire centuries before. The inhabitants of the Rhenish\r\nProvinces had murmured for a while at the extortionate rule of the\r\nDirectory; but their severance from Germany and their incorporation with a\r\nforeign race touched no fibre of patriotic regret; and after the\r\nestablishment of a better order of things under the Consulate the\r\nannexation to France appears to have become highly popular. [93] Among a\r\nrace whose members could thus be actually conquered and annexed without\r\ndoing violence to their feelings Bonaparte had no difficulty in finding\r\nwilling allies. While the Diet dragged on its debates upon the settlement\r\nof the Empire, the minor States pursued their bargainings with the French\r\nGovernment; and on the 14th of August, 1801, Bavaria signed the first of\r\nthose treaties which made the First Consul the patron of Western Germany.\r\nTwo months later a secret treaty between France and Russia admitted the new\r\nCzar, Alexander, to a share in the reorganisation of the Empire. The\r\nGovernments of Paris and St. Petersburg pledged themselves to united action\r\nfor the purpose of maintaining an equilibrium between Austria and Prussia;\r\nand the Czar further stipulated for the advancement of his own relatives,\r\nthe Sovereigns of Bavaria, Baden, and Würtemberg. The relationship of these\r\npetty princes to the Russian family enabled Bonaparte to present to the\r\nCzar, as a graceful concession, the very measure which most vitally\r\nadvanced his own power in Germany. Alexander's intervention made resistance\r\non the part of Austria hopeless. One after another the German Sovereigns\r\nsettled with their patrons for a share in the spoil; and on the 3rd of\r\nJune, 1802, a secret agreement between France and Russia embodied the whole\r\nof these arrangements, and disposed of almost all the Free Cities and the\r\nentire ecclesiastical territory of the Empire.\r\n\r\n[Diet of Ratisbon accepts French Scheme.]\r\n\r\n[End of German Ecclesiastical States and forty-five Free Cities, March,\r\n1803.]\r\n\r\nWhen everything had thus been settled by the foreigners, a Committee, to\r\nwhich the Diet of Ratisbon had referred the work of re-organisation, began\r\nits sessions, assisted by a French and a Russian representative. The Scheme\r\nwhich had been agreed upon between France and Russia was produced entire;\r\nand in spite of the anger and the threats of Austria it passed the\r\nCommittee with no greater delay than was inseparable from everything\r\nconnected with German affairs. The Committee presented the Scheme to the\r\nDiet: the Diet only agitated itself as to the means of passing the Scheme\r\nwithout violating those formalities which were the breath of its life. The\r\nproposed destruction of all the Ecclesiastical States, and of forty-five\r\nout of the fifty Free Cities, would extinguish a third part of the members\r\nof the Diet itself. If these unfortunate bodies were permitted to vote upon\r\nthe measure, their votes might result in its rejection: if unsummoned,\r\ntheir absence would impair the validity of the resolution. By a masterpiece\r\nof conscientious pedantry it was agreed that the doomed prelates and cities\r\nshould be duly called to vote in their turn, and that upon the mention each\r\nname the answer \"absent\" should be returned by an officer. Thus, faithful\r\nto its formalities, the Empire voted the destruction of its ancient\r\nConstitution; and the sovereignties of the Ecclesiastics and Free Cities,\r\nwhich had lasted for so many centuries, vanished from Europe (March, 1803).\r\n[94]\r\n\r\n[Effect on Germany.]\r\n\r\nThe loss was small indeed. The internal condition of the priest-ruled\r\ndistricts was generally wretched; heavy ignorance, beggary, and intolerance\r\nreduced life to a gross and dismal inertia. Except in their patronage of\r\nmusic, the ecclesiastical princes had perhaps rendered no single service to\r\nGermany. The Free Cities, as a rule, were sunk in debt; the management of\r\ntheir affairs had become the perquisite of a few lawyers and privileged\r\nfamilies. For Germany, as a nation, the destruction of these petty\r\nsovereignties was not only an advantage but an absolute necessity. The\r\norder by which they were superseded was not devised in the interest of\r\nGermany itself; yet even in the arrangements imposed by the foreigner\r\nGermany gained centres from which the institutions of modern political life\r\nentered into regions where no public authority had yet been known beyond\r\nthe court of the bishop or the feudal officers of the manor. [95] Through\r\nthe suppression of the Ecclesiastical States a Protestant majority was\r\nproduced in the Diet. The change bore witness to the decline of Austrian\r\nand of Catholic energy during the past century; it scarcely indicated the\r\nfuture supremacy of the Protestant rival of Austria; for the real interests\r\nof Germany were but faintly imaged in the Diet, and the leadership of the\r\nrace was still open to the Power which should most sincerely identify\r\nitself with the German nation. The first result of the changed character of\r\nthe Diet was the confiscation of all landed property held by religious or\r\ncharitable bodies, even where these had never advanced the slightest claim\r\nto political independence. The Diet declared the whole of the land held in\r\nGermany by pious foundations to be at the disposal of the Governments for\r\npurposes of religion, of education, and of financial relief. The more needy\r\ncourts immediately seized so welcome an opportunity of increasing their\r\nrevenues. Germany lost nothing by the dissolution of some hundreds of\r\nmonasteries; the suppression of hospitals and the impoverishment of\r\nUniversities was a doubtful benefit. Through the destruction of the\r\nEcclesiastical States and the confiscation of Church lands, the support of\r\nan army of priests was thrown upon the public revenues. The Elector of\r\nCologne, who had been an indifferent civil ruler, became a very prosperous\r\nclergyman on £20,000 a year. All the members of the annexed or disendowed\r\nestablishments, down to the acolytes and the sacristans, were credited with\r\nannuities equal in value to what they had lost. But in the confusion caused\r\nby war the means to satisfy these claims was not always forthcoming; and\r\nthe ecclesiastical revolution, so beneficial on the whole to the public\r\ninterest, was not effected without much severe and undeserved individual\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\n[Governments in Germany become more absolute and more regular.]\r\n\r\n[Bavaria. Reforms of Montgelas.]\r\n\r\n[Suppression of the Knights.]\r\n\r\nThe movement of 1803 put an end to an order of things more curious as a\r\nsurvival of the mixed religious and political form of the Holy Roman Empire\r\nthan important in the actual state of Europe. The temporal power now lost\r\nby the Church in Germany had been held in such sluggish hands that its\r\neffect was hardly visible except in a denser prejudice and an idler life\r\nthan prevailed under other Governments. The first consequence of its\r\ndownfall was that a great part of Germany which had hitherto had no\r\npolitical organisation at all gained the benefit of a regular system of\r\ntaxation, of police, of civil and of criminal justice. If harsh and\r\ndespotic, the Governments which rose to power at the expense of the Church\r\nwere usually not wanting in the love of order and uniformity. Officers of\r\nthe State administered a fixed law where custom and privilege had hitherto\r\nbeen the only rule. Appointments ceased to be bought or inherited; trades\r\nand professions were thrown open; the peasant was relieved of his heaviest\r\nfeudal burdens. Among the newly consolidated States, Bavaria was the one\r\nwhere the reforming impulse of the time took the strongest form. A new\r\ndynasty, springing from the west of the Rhine, brought something of the\r\nspirit of French liberalism into a country hitherto unsurpassed in Western\r\nEurope for its ignorance and bigotry. [96] The Minister Montgelas, a\r\npolitician of French enlightenment, entered upon the same crusade against\r\nfeudal and ecclesiastical disorder which Joseph had inaugurated in Austria\r\ntwenty years before. His measures for subjecting the clergy to the law, and\r\nfor depriving the Church of its control over education, were almost\r\nidentical with those which in 1790 had led to the revolt of Belgium; and\r\nthe Bavarian landowners now unconsciously reproduced all the mediæval\r\nplatitudes of the University of Louvain. Montgelas organised and levelled\r\nwith a remorseless common sense. Among his victims there was a class which\r\nhad escaped destruction in the recent changes. The Knights of the Empire,\r\nwith their village jurisdictions, were still legally existent; but to\r\nMontgelas such a class appeared a mere absurdity, and he sent his soldiers\r\nto disperse their courts and to seize their tolls. Loud lamentation\r\nassailed the Emperor at Vienna. If the dethroned bishops had bewailed the\r\napproaching extinction of Christianity in Europe, the knights just as\r\nconvincingly deplored the end of chivalry. Knightly honour, now being swept\r\nfrom the earth, was proved to be the true soul of German nationality, the\r\ninvisible support of the Imperial throne. For a moment the intervention of\r\nthe Emperor forced Montgelas to withdraw his grasp from the sacred rents\r\nand turnpikes; but the threatening storm passed over, and the example of\r\nBavaria was gradually followed by the neighbouring Courts.\r\n\r\n[Stein and the Duke of Nassau.]\r\n\r\n[Stein's attack on the Minor Princes.]\r\n\r\nIt was to the weak and unpatriotic princes who were enriched by the French\r\nthat the knights fell victims. Among the knights thus despoiled by the Duke\r\nof Nassau was the Ritter vom Stein, a nobleman who had entered the Prussian\r\nservice in the reign of Frederick the Great, and who had lately been placed\r\nin high office in the newly-acquired province of Münster. Stein was\r\nthoroughly familiar with the advantages of systematic government; the loss\r\nof his native parochial jurisdiction was not a serious one to a man who had\r\nbecome a power in Prussia; and although domestic pride had its share in\r\nStein's resentment, the protest now published by him against the\r\naggressions of the Duke of Nassau sounded a different note from that of his\r\norder generally. That a score of farmers should pay their dues and take off\r\ntheir hats to the officer of the Duke of Nassau instead of to the bailiff\r\nof the Ritter vom Stein was not a matter to excite deep feeling in Europe;\r\nbut that the consolidation of Germany should be worked out in the interest\r\nof French hirelings instead of in the interests of the German people was\r\njustly treated by Stein as a subject for patriotic anger. In his letter\r\n[97] to the Duke of Nassau, Stein reproached his own despoiler and the\r\nwhole tribe of petty princes with that treason to German interests which\r\nhad won them the protection of the foreigner. He argued that the knights\r\nwere a far less important obstacle to German unity than those very princes\r\nto whom the knights were sacrificed; and he invoked that distant day which\r\nshould give to Germany a real national unity, over knights and princes\r\nalike, under the leadership of a single patriotic sovereign. Stein's appeal\r\nfound little response among his contemporaries. Like a sober man among\r\ndrunkards, he seemed to be scarcely rational. The simple conception of a\r\nnation sacrificing its internal rivalries in order to avert foreign rule\r\nwas folly to the politicians who had all their lives long been outwitting\r\none another at Vienna or Berlin, or who had just become persons of\r\nconsequence in Europe through the patronage of Bonaparte. Yet, if years of\r\nintolerable suffering were necessary before any large party in Germany rose\r\nto the idea of German union, the ground had now at least been broken. In\r\nthe changes that followed the Peace of Lunéville the fixity and routine of\r\nGermany received its death-blow. In all but name the Empire had ceased to\r\nexist. Change and re-constitution in one form or another had become\r\nfamiliar to all men's minds; and one real statesman at the least was\r\nalready beginning to learn the lesson which later events were to teach to\r\nthe rest of the German race.\r\n\r\n[France, 1801-1804.]\r\n\r\n[Civil Code.]\r\n\r\nFour years of peace separated the Treaty of Lunéville from the next\r\noutbreak of war between France and any Continental Power. They were years\r\nof extension of French influence in every neighbouring State; in France\r\nitself, years of the consolidation of Bonaparte's power, and of the decline\r\nof everything that checked his personal rule. The legislative bodies sank\r\ninto the insignificance for which they had been designed; everything that\r\nwas suffered to wear the appearance of strength owed its vigour to the\r\npersonal support of the First Consul. Among the institutions which date\r\nfrom this period, two, equally associated with the name of Napoleon, have\r\ntaken a prominent place in history, the Civil Code and the Concordat. Since\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century the codification of law had been\r\npursued with more or less success by almost every Government in Europe. In\r\nFrance the Constituent Assembly of 1789 had ordered the statutes, by which\r\nit superseded the old variety of local customs, to be thus cast into a\r\nsystematic form. A Committee of the Convention had completed the draft of a\r\nCivil Code. The Directory had in its turn appointed a Commission; but the\r\nproject still remained unfulfilled when the Directory was driven from\r\npower. Bonaparte instinctively threw himself into a task so congenial to\r\nhis own systematising spirit, and stimulated the efforts of the best\r\njurists in France by his personal interest and pride in the work of\r\nlegislation. A Commission of lawyers, appointed by the First Consul,\r\npresented the successive chapters of a Civil Code to the Council of State.\r\nIn the discussions in the Council of State Bonaparte himself took an\r\nactive, though not always a beneficial, part. The draft of each chapter, as\r\nit left the Council of State, was submitted, as a project of Law, to the\r\nTribunate and to the Legislative Body. For a moment the free expression of\r\nopinion in the Tribunate caused Bonaparte to suspend his work in impatient\r\njealousy. The Tribunate, however, was soon brought to silence; and in\r\nMarch, 1804, France received the Code which has formed from that time to\r\nthe present the basis of its civil rights.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon as a legislator.]\r\n\r\nWhen Napoleon declared that he desired his fame to rest upon the Civil\r\nCode, he showed his appreciation of the power which names exercise over\r\nmankind. It is probable that a majority of the inhabitants of Western\r\nEurope believe that Napoleon actually invented the laws which bear his\r\nname. As a matter of fact, the substance of these laws was fixed by the\r\nsuccessive Assemblies of the Revolution; and, in the final revision which\r\nproduced the Civil Code, Napoleon appears to have originated neither more\r\nnor less than several of the members of his Council whose names have long\r\nbeen forgotten. He is unquestionably entitled to the honour of a great\r\nlegislator, not, however, as one who, like Solon or like Mahomet, himself\r\ncreated a new body of law, but as one who most vigorously pursued the work\r\nof consolidating and popularising law by the help of all the skilled and\r\nscientific minds whose resources were at his command. Though faulty in\r\nparts, the Civil Code, through its conciseness, its simplicity, and its\r\njustice, enabled Napoleon to carry a new and incomparably better social\r\norder into every country that became part of his Empire. Four other Codes,\r\nappearing at intervals from the year 1804 to the year 1810, embodied, in a\r\ncorresponding form, the Law of Commerce, the Criminal Law, and the Rules of\r\nCivil and of Criminal Process. [98] The whole remains a monument of the\r\nlegal energy of the period which began in 1789, and of the sagacity with\r\nwhich Napoleon associated with his own rule all the science and the\r\nreforming zeal of the jurists of his day.\r\n\r\n[The Concordat.]\r\n\r\n[The Concordat destroys the Free Church.]\r\n\r\nFar more distinctively the work of Napoleon's own mind was the\r\nreconciliation with the Church of Rome effected by the Concordat. It was a\r\nrestoration of religion similar to that restoration of political order\r\nwhich made the public service the engine of a single will. The bishops and\r\npriests, whose appointment the Concordat transferred from their\r\ncongregations to the Government, were as much instruments of the First\r\nConsul as his prefects and his gendarmes. The spiritual wants of the\r\npublic, the craving of the poor for religious consolation, were made the\r\npretext for introducing the new theological police. But the situation of\r\nthe Catholic Church was in reality no worse in France at the commencement\r\nof the Consulate than its present situation in Ireland. The Republic had\r\nindeed subjected the non-juring priests to the heaviest penalties, but the\r\nexercise of Christian worship, which, even in the Reign of Terror, had only\r\nbeen interrupted by local and individual fanaticism, had long recovered the\r\nprotection of the law, services in the open air being alone prohibited.\r\n[99] Since 1795 the local authorities had been compelled to admit the\r\nreligious societies of their district to the use of church-buildings.\r\nThough the coup d'état of Fructidor, 1797, renewed the persecution of\r\nnon-juring priests, it in no way checked the activity of the Constitutional\r\nChurch, now free from all connection with the Civil Government. While the\r\nnon-juring priests, exiled as political offenders, or theatrically adoring\r\nthe sacred elements in the woods, pretended that the age of the martyrs had\r\nreturned to France, a Constitutional Church, ministering in 4,000 parishes,\r\nunprivileged but unharassed by the State, supplied the nation with an\r\nearnest and respectable body of clergy. [100] But in the eyes of the First\r\nConsul everything left to voluntary association was so much lost to the\r\ncentral power. In the order of nature, peasants must obey priests, priests\r\nmust obey bishops, and bishops must obey the First Consul. An alliance with\r\nthe Pope offered to Bonaparte the means of supplanting the popular\r\norganisation of the Constitutional Church by an imposing hierarchy, rigid\r\nin its orthodoxy and unquestioning in its devotion to himself. In return\r\nfor the consecration of his own rule, Bonaparte did not shrink from\r\ninviting the Pope to an exercise of authority such as the Holy See had\r\nnever even claimed in France. The whole of the existing French Bishops,\r\nboth the exiled non-jurors and those of the Constitutional Church, were\r\nsummoned to resign their Sees into the hands of the Pope; against all who\r\nrefused to do so sentence of deposition was pronounced by the Pontiff,\r\nwithout a word heard in defence, or the shadow of a fault alleged. The Sees\r\nwere re-organised, and filled up by nominees of the First Consul. The\r\nposition of the great body of the clergy was substantially altered in its\r\nrelation to the Bishops. Episcopal power was made despotic, like all other\r\npower in France: thousands of the clergy, hitherto secure in their livings,\r\nwere placed at the disposal of their bishop, and rendered liable to be\r\ntransferred at the pleasure of their superior from place to place. The\r\nConstitutional Church vanished, but religion appeared to be honoured by\r\nbecoming part of the State.\r\n\r\n[Results in Ultramontanism.]\r\n\r\nIn its immediate action, the Napoleonic Church served the purpose for which\r\nit was intended. For some few years the clergy unflaggingly preached,\r\nprayed, and catechised to the glory of their restorer. In the greater cycle\r\nof religious change, the Concordat of Bonaparte appears in another light.\r\nHowever little appreciated at the time, it was the greatest, the most\r\ncritical, victory which the Roman See has ever gained over the more\r\nenlightened and the more national elements in the Catholic Church. It\r\nconverted the Catholicism of France from a faith already far more\r\nindependent than that of Fénélon and Bossuet into the Catholicism which in\r\nour own day has outstripped the bigotry of Spain and Austria in welcoming\r\nthe dogma of Papal infallibility. The lower clergy, condemned by the State\r\nto an intolerable subjection, soon found their only hope in an appeal to\r\nRome, and instinctively worked as the emissaries of the Roman See. The\r\nBishops, who owed their office to an unprecedented exercise of Papal power\r\nand to the destruction of religious independence in France, were not the\r\nmen who could maintain a struggle with the Papacy for the ancient Gallican\r\nliberties. In the resistance to the Papacy which had been maintained by the\r\nContinental Churches in a greater or less degree during the eighteenth\r\ncentury, France had on the whole taken the most effective part; but, from\r\nthe time when the Concordat dissolved both the ancient and the\r\nrevolutionary Church system of France, the Gallican tradition of the past\r\nbecame as powerless among the French clergy as the philosophical liberalism\r\nof the Revolution.\r\n\r\n[So do the German changes.]\r\n\r\nIn Germany the destruction of the temporal power of the Church tended\r\nequally to Ultramontanism. An archbishop of Cologne who governed half a\r\nmillion subjects was less likely to prostrate himself before the Papal\r\nChair than an archbishop of Cologne who was only one among a regiment of\r\nchurchmen. The spiritual Electors and Princes who lost their dominions in\r\n1801 had understood by the interests of their order something more tangible\r\nthan a body of doctrines. When not hostile to the Papacy, they had usually\r\ntreated it with indifference. The conception of a Catholic society exposed\r\nto persecution at the hands of the State on account of its devotion to Rome\r\nwas one which had never entered the mind of German ecclesiastics in the\r\neighteenth century. Without the changes effected in Germany by the Treaty\r\nof Lunéville, without the Concordat of Bonaparte, Catholic orthodoxy would\r\nnever have become identical with Ultramontanism. In this respect the\r\nopening years of the present century mark a turning-point in the relation\r\nof the Church to modern life. Already, in place of the old monarchical\r\nGovernments, friendly on the whole to the Catholic Church, events were\r\npreparing the way for that changed order with which the century seems\r\ndestined to close--an emancipated France, a free Italy, a secular,\r\nstate-disciplined Germany, and the Church in conspiracy against them all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nEngland claims Malta--War renewed--Bonaparte occupies Hanover, and\r\nblockades the Elbe--Remonstrances of Prussia--Cadoudal's Plot--Murder of\r\nthe Duke of Enghien--Napoleon Emperor--Coalition of 1805--Prussia holds\r\naloof--State of Austria--Failure of Napoleon's attempt to gain naval\r\nsuperiority in the Channel--Campaign in Western Germany--Capitulation of\r\nUlm--Trafalgar--Treaty of Potsdam between Prussia and the Allies--The\r\nFrench enter Vienna--Haugwitz sent to Napoleon with Prussian Ultimatum--\r\nBattle of Austerlitz--Haugwitz signs a Treaty of Alliance with\r\nNapoleon--Peace--Treaty of Presburg--End of the Holy Roman Empire--\r\nNaples given to Joseph Bonaparte--Battle of Maida--The Napoleonic Empire\r\nand Dynasty--Federation of the Rhine--State of Germany--Possibility of\r\nmaintaining the Empire of 1806.\r\n\r\n\r\n[England prepares for war, Nov., 1802.]\r\n\r\n[England claims Malta.]\r\n\r\nWar was renewed between France and Great Britain in the spring of 1803.\r\nAddington's Government, in their desire for peace, had borne with\r\nBonaparte's aggressions during all the months of negotiation at Amiens;\r\nthey had met his complaints against the abuse of the English press by\r\nprosecuting his Royalist libellers; throughout the Session of 1802 they had\r\nupheld the possibility of peace against the attacks of their parliamentary\r\nopponents. The invasion of Switzerland in the autumn of 1802, following the\r\nannexation of Piedmont, forced the Ministry to alter its tone. The King's\r\nSpeech at the meeting of Parliament in November declared that the changes\r\nin operation on the Continent demanded measures of security on the part of\r\nGreat Britain. The naval and military forces of the country were restored\r\nto a war-footing; the evacuation of Malta by Great Britain, which had\r\nhitherto been delayed chiefly through a misunderstanding with Russia, was\r\nno longer treated as a matter of certainty. While the English Government\r\nstill wavered, a challenge was thrown down by the First Consul which forced\r\nthem into decided action. The _Moniteur_ published on the 13th of January,\r\n1803, a report upon Egypt by Colonel Sebastiani, pointing in the plainest\r\nterms to the renewal of French attacks upon the East. The British\r\nGovernment demanded explanations, and declared that until satisfaction was\r\ngiven upon this point they should retain possession of Malta. Malta was in\r\nfact appropriated by Great Britain as an equivalent for the Continental\r\nterritory added to France since the end of the war. [101]\r\n\r\n[War, May, 1803.]\r\n\r\nIt would have been better policy if, some months earlier, Bonaparte had\r\nbeen required to withdraw from Piedmont or from Switzerland, under pain of\r\nhostilities with England. Great Britain had as little technical right to\r\nretain Malta as Bonaparte had to annex Piedmont. The desire for peace had,\r\nhowever, led Addington's Government to remain inactive until Bonaparte's\r\naggressions had become accomplished facts. It was now too late to attempt\r\nto undo them: England could only treat the settlement of Amiens as\r\nsuperseded, and claim compensation on its own side. Malta was the position\r\nmost necessary to Great Britain, in order to prevent Bonaparte from\r\ncarrying out projects in Egypt and Greece of which the Government had\r\nevidence independent of Sebastiani's report. The value of Malta, so lately\r\ndenied by Nelson, was now fully understood both in France and England. No\r\nsooner had the English Ministry avowed its intention of retaining the\r\nisland than the First Consul declared himself compelled to take up arms in\r\nbehalf of the faith of treaties. Ignoring his own violations of\r\ntreaty-rights in Italy and Switzerland, Bonaparte declared the retention of\r\nMalta by Great Britain to be an outrage against all Europe. He assailed the\r\nBritish Ambassador with the utmost fury at a reception held at the\r\nTuileries on the 13th of March; and, after a correspondence of two months,\r\nwhich probably marked his sense of the power and obstinacy of his enemy,\r\nthe conflict was renewed which was now to continue without a break until\r\nBonaparte was driven from his throne.\r\n\r\n[Bonaparte and Hanover.]\r\n\r\nSo long as England was without Continental allies its warfare was limited\r\nto the seizure of colonies and the blockade of ports: on the part of France\r\nnothing could be effected against the island Power except by actual\r\ninvasion. There was, however, among the communities of Germany one which,\r\nin the arguments of a conqueror, might be treated as a dependency of\r\nEngland, and made to suffer for its connection with the British Crown.\r\nHanover had hitherto by common agreement been dissociated from the wars in\r\nwhich its Elector engaged as King of England; even the personal presence of\r\nKing George II. at the battle of Dettingen had been held no ground for\r\nviolating its neutrality. Bonaparte, however, was untroubled by precedents\r\nin a case where he had so much to gain. Apart from its value as a possible\r\nobject of exchange in the next treaty with England, Hanover would serve as\r\na means of influencing Prussia: it was also worth so many millions in cash\r\nthrough the requisitions which might be imposed upon its inhabitants. The\r\nonly scruple felt by Bonaparte in attacking Hanover arose from the\r\npossibility of a forcible resistance on the part of Prussia to the\r\nappearance of a French army in North Germany. Accordingly, before the\r\ninvasion began, General Duroc was sent to Berlin to inform the King of the\r\nFirst Consul's intentions, and to soothe any irritation that might be felt\r\nat the Prussian Court by assurances of friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n[Prussia and Hanover.]\r\n\r\nIt was a moment of the most critical importance to Prussia. Prussia was the\r\nrecognised guardian of Northern Germany; every consideration of interest\r\nand of honour required that its Government should forbid the proposed\r\noccupation of Hanover--if necessary, at the risk of actual war. Hanover in\r\nthe hands of France meant the extinction of German independence up to the\r\nfrontiers of the Prussian State. If, as it was held at Berlin, the cause of\r\nGreat Britain was an unjust one, and if the connection of Hanover with the\r\nBritish Crown was for the future to make that province a scapegoat for the\r\noffences of England, the wisest course for Prussia would have been to\r\ndeliver Hanover at once from its French and from its English enemies by\r\noccupying it with its own forces. The Foreign Minister, Count Haugwitz,\r\nappears to have recommended this step, but his counsels were overruled.\r\nKing Frederick William III., who had succeeded his father in 1797, was a\r\nconscientious but a timid and spiritless being. Public affairs were in the\r\nhands of his private advisers, of whom the most influential were the\r\nso-called cabinet-secretaries, Lombard and Beyme, men credulously anxious\r\nfor the goodwill of France, and perversely blind to the native force and\r\nworth which still existed in the Prussian Monarchy. [102] Instead of\r\ndeclaring the entry of the French into Hanover to be absolutely\r\nincompatible with the safety of the other North German States, King\r\nFrederick William endeavoured to avert it by diplomacy. He tendered his\r\nmediation to the British Government upon condition of the evacuation of\r\nMalta; and, when this proposal was bluntly rejected, he offered to the\r\nFirst Consul his personal security that Hanover should pay a sum of money\r\nin order to be spared the intended invasion.\r\n\r\n[French enter Hanover, May, 1803.]\r\n\r\n[Oppression in Hanover, 1803-1805.]\r\n\r\nSuch a proposal marked the depth to which Prussian statemanship had sunk;\r\nit failed to affect the First Consul in the slightest degree. While\r\nnegotiations were still proceeding, a French division, commanded by General\r\nMortier, entered Hanover (May, 1803). The Hanoverian army was lost through\r\nthe follies of the civil Government; the Duke of Cambridge, commander of\r\none of its divisions, less ingenious than his brother the Duke of York in\r\nfinding excuses for capitulation, resigned his commission, and fled to\r\nEngland, along with many brave soldiers, who subsequently found in the army\r\nof Great Britain the opportunity for honourable service which was denied to\r\nthem at home. Hanover passed into the possession of France, and for two\r\nyears the miseries of French occupation were felt to the full. Extortion\r\nconsumed the homely wealth of the country; the games and meetings of the\r\npeople were prohibited; French spies violated the confidences of private\r\nlife; law was administered by foreign soldiers; the press existed only for\r\nthe purpose of French proselytism. It was in Hanover that the bitterness of\r\nthat oppression was first felt which subsequently roused all North Germany\r\nagainst a foreign master, and forced upon the race the long-forgotten\r\nclaims of patriotism and honour.\r\n\r\n[French blockade the Elbe.]\r\n\r\n[Vain remonstrance of Prussia.]\r\n\r\nBonaparte had justly calculated upon the inaction of the Prussian\r\nGovernment when he gave the order to General Mortier to enter Hanover; his\r\nnext step proved the growth of his confidence in Prussia's impassivity. A\r\nFrench force was despatched to Cuxhaven, at the mouth of the Elbe, in order\r\nto stop the commerce of Great Britain with the interior of Germany. The\r\nBritish Government immediately informed the Court of Berlin that it should\r\nblockade the Elbe and the Weser against the ships of all nations unless the\r\nFrench soldiers withdrew from the Elbe. As the linen trade of Silesia and\r\nother branches of Prussian industry depended upon the free navigation of\r\nthe Elbe, the threatened reprisals of the British Government raised very\r\nserious questions for Prussia. It was France, not England, that had first\r\nviolated the neutrality of the river highway; and the King of Prussia now\r\nfelt himself compelled to demand assurances Bonaparte that the interests of\r\nGermany should suffer no further injury at his hands. A letter was written\r\nby the King to the First Consul, and entrusted to the cabinet-secretary,\r\nLombard, who carried it to Napoleon at Brussels (July, 1803). Lombard, the\r\nson of French parents who had settled at Berlin in the reign of Frederick\r\nthe Great, had risen from a humble station through his skill in expression\r\nin the two languages that were native to him; and the accomplishments which\r\nwould have made him a good clerk or a successful journalist made him in the\r\neyes of Frederick William a counsellor for kings. The history of his\r\nmission to Brussels gives curious evidence both of the fascination\r\nexercised by Napoleon over common minds, and of the political helplessness\r\nwhich in Prussia could now be mistaken for the quality of a statesman.\r\nLombard failed to obtain from Napoleon any guarantee or security whatever;\r\nyet he wrote back in terms of the utmost delight upon the success of his\r\nmission. Napoleon had infatuated him by the mere exercise of his personal\r\ncharm. \"What I cannot describe,\" said Lombard, in his report to the King\r\nrelating his interview with the First Consul, [103] \"is the tone of\r\ngoodness and noble frankness with which he expressed his reverence for your\r\nMajesty's rights, and asked for that confidence from your Majesty which he\r\nso well deserves.\" \"I only wish,\" he cried at the close of Napoleon's\r\naddress, \"that I could convey to the King, my master, every one of your\r\nwords and the tone in which they are uttered; he would then, I am sure,\r\nfeel a double joy at the justice with which you have always been treated at\r\nhis hands.\" Lombard's colleagues at Berlin were perhaps not stronger men\r\nthan the envoy himself, but they were at least beyond the range of\r\nNapoleon's voice and glance, and they received this rhapsody with coldness.\r\nThey complained that no single concession had been made by the First Consul\r\nupon the points raised by the King. Cuxhaven continued in French hands; the\r\nBritish inexorably blockaded the Germans upon their own neutral waters; and\r\nthe cautious statecraft of Prussia proved as valueless to Germany as the\r\nobstinate, speculating warfare of Austria.\r\n\r\n[Alexander displeased.]\r\n\r\nThere was, however, a Power which watched the advance of French dominion\r\ninto Northern Germany with less complaisance than the Germans themselves.\r\nThe Czar of Russia had gradually come to understand the part allotted to\r\nhim by Bonaparte since the Peace of Lunéville, and was no longer inclined\r\nto serve as the instrument of French ambition. Bonaparte's occupation of\r\nHanover changed the attitude of Alexander into one of coldness and\r\ndistrust. Alexander saw and lamented the help which he himself had given to\r\nBonaparte in Germany: events that now took place in France itself, as well\r\nas the progress of French intrigues in Turkey, [104] threw him into the\r\narms of Bonaparte's enemies, and prepared the way for a new European\r\ncoalition.\r\n\r\n[Bonaparte about to become Emperor.]\r\n\r\n[Murder of the Duke of Enghien, March 20, 1804.]\r\n\r\nThe First Bonaparte Consul had determined to assume the dignity of Emperor.\r\nThe renewal of war with England excited a new outburst of enthusiasm for\r\nhis person; nothing was wanting to place the crown on his head but the\r\ndiscovery of a plot against his life. Such a plot had been long and\r\ncarefully followed by the police. A Breton gentleman, Georges Cadoudal, had\r\nformed the design of attacking the First Consul in the streets of Paris in\r\nthe midst of his guards. Cadoudal and his fellow-conspirators, including\r\nGeneral Pichegru, were traced by the police from the coast of Normandy to\r\nParis: an unsuccessful attempt was made to lure the Count of Artois, and\r\nother royal patrons of the conspiracy, from Great Britain. When all the\r\nconspirators who could be enticed to France were collected within the\r\ncapital, the police, who had watched every stage of the movement, began to\r\nmake arrests. Moreau, the last Republican soldier of France, was charged\r\nwith complicity in the plot. Pichegru and Cadoudal were thrown into prison,\r\nthere to await their doom; Moreau, who probably wished for the overthrow of\r\nthe Consular Government, but had no part in the design against Bonaparte's\r\nlife, [105] was kept under arrest and loaded with official calumny. One\r\nsacrifice more remained to be made, in place of the Bourbon d'Artois, who\r\nbaffled the police of the First Consul beyond the seas. In the territory of\r\nBaden, twelve miles from the French frontier, there lived a prince of the\r\nexiled house, the Duke of Enghien, a soldier under the first Coalition\r\nagainst France, now a harmless dependent on the bounty of England. French\r\nspies surrounded him; his excursions into the mountains gave rise to a\r\nsuspicion that he was concerned in Pichegru's plot. This was enough to mark\r\nhim for destruction. Bonaparte gave orders that he should be seized,\r\nbrought to Paris, and executed. On the 15th of March, 1804, a troop of\r\nFrench soldiers crossed the Rhine and arrested the Duke in his own house at\r\nEttenheim. They arrived with him at Paris on the 20th. He was taken to the\r\nfort of Vincennes without entering the city. On that same night a\r\ncommission of six colonels sat in judgment upon the prisoner, whose grave\r\nwas already dug, and pronounced sentence of death without hearing a word of\r\nevidence. At daybreak the Duke was led out and shot.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon Emperor, May 18, 1804.]\r\n\r\nIf some barbaric instinct made the slaughter of his predecessor's kindred\r\nin Bonaparte's own eyes the omen of a successful usurpation, it was not so\r\nwith Europe generally. One universal sense of horror passed over the\r\nContinent. The Court of Russia put on mourning; even the Diet of Ratisbon\r\nshowed signs of human passion at the indignity done to Germany by the\r\nseizure of the Duke of Enghien on German soil. Austria kept silent, but\r\nwatched the signs of coming war. France alone showed no pity. Before the\r\nDuke of Enghien had been dead a week, the Senate besought Napoleon to give\r\nto France the security of a hereditary throne. Prefects, bishops, mayors,\r\nand councils with one voice repeated the official prayer. A resolution in\r\nfavour of imperial rule was brought forward in the Tribunate, and passed,\r\nafter a noble and solitary protest on the part of Carnot. A decree of the\r\nSenate embodied the terms of the new Constitution; and on the 18th of May,\r\nwithout waiting for the sanction of a national vote, Napoleon assumed the\r\ntitle of Emperor of the French.\r\n\r\n[Title of Emperor of Austria, Aug., 1804.]\r\n\r\nIn France itself the change was one more of the name than of the substance\r\nof power. Napoleon could not be vested with a more absolute authority than\r\nhe already possessed; but the forms of republican equality vanished; and\r\nalthough the real social equality given to France by the Revolution was\r\nbeyond reach of change, the nation had to put up with a bastard Court and a\r\nfictitious aristocracy of Corsican princes, Terrorist excellencies, and\r\nJacobin dukes. The new dynasty was recognised at Vienna and Berlin: on the\r\npart of Austria it received the compliment of an imitation. Three months\r\nafter the assumption of the Imperial title by Napoleon, the Emperor Francis\r\n(Emperor in Germany, but King in Hungary and Bohemia) assumed the title of\r\nEmperor of all his Austrian dominions. The true reason for this act was the\r\nvirtual dissolution of the Germanic system by the Peace of Lunéville, and\r\nthe probability that the old Imperial dignity, if preserved in name, would\r\nsoon be transferred to some client of Napoleon or to Napoleon himself. Such\r\nan apprehension was, however, not one that could be confessed to Europe.\r\nInstead of the ruin of Germany, the grandeur of Austria was made the\r\nostensible ground of change. In language which seemed to be borrowed from\r\nthe scriptural history of Nebuchadnezzar, the Emperor Francis declared\r\nthat, although no possible addition could be made to his own personal\r\ndignity, as Roman Emperor, yet the ancient glory of the Austrian House, the\r\ngrandeur of the principalities and kingdoms which were united under its\r\ndominion, required that the Sovereigns of Austria should hold a title equal\r\nto that of the greatest European throne. A general war against Napoleon was\r\nalready being proposed by the Court of St. Petersburg; but for the present\r\nthe Corsican and the Hapsburg Cæsar exchanged their hypocritical\r\ncongratulations. [106]\r\n\r\n[Pitt again Minister, May, 1804.]\r\n\r\n[Coalition of 1805.]\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same time that Bonaparte ascended the throne, Pitt returned\r\nto power in Great Britain. He was summoned by the general distrust felt in\r\nAddington's Ministry, and by the belief that no statesman but himself could\r\nrally the Powers of Europe against the common enemy. Pitt was not long in\r\nframing with Russia the plan of a third Coalition. The Czar broke off\r\ndiplomatic intercourse with Napoleon in September, 1804, and induced the\r\nCourt of Vienna to pledge itself to resist any further extension of French\r\npower. Sweden entered into engagements with Great Britain. On the opening\r\nof Parliament at the beginning of 1805, King George III. announced that an\r\nunderstanding existed between Great Britain and Russia, and asked in\r\ngeneral terms for a provision for Continental subsidies. In April, a treaty\r\nwas signed at St. Petersburg by the representatives of Russia and Great\r\nBritain, far more comprehensive and more serious in its provisions than any\r\nwhich had yet united the Powers against France. [107] Russia and England\r\nbound themselves to direct their efforts to the formation of a European\r\nLeague capable of placing five hundred thousand men in the field. Great\r\nBritain undertook to furnish subsidies to every member of the League; no\r\npeace was to be concluded with France but by common consent; conquests\r\nmade by any of the belligerents were to remain unappropriated until the\r\ngeneral peace; and at the termination of the war a Congress was to fix\r\ncertain disputed points of international right, and to establish a\r\nfederative European system for their maintenance and enforcement. As the\r\nimmediate objects of the League, the treaty specified the expulsion of\r\nthe French from Holland, Switzerland, Italy, and Northern Germany; the\r\nre-establishment of the King of Sardinia in Piedmont, with an increase of\r\nterritory; and the creation of a solid barrier against any future\r\nusurpations of France. The last expression signified the union of Holland\r\nand part of Belgium under the House of Orange. In this respect, as in the\r\nprovision for a common disposal of conquests and for the settlement of\r\nEuropean affairs by a Congress, the Anglo-Russian Treaty of 1805 defined\r\nthe policy actually carried out in 1814. Other territorial changes now\r\nsuggested by Pitt, including the annexation of the Rhenish Provinces to\r\nthe Prussian Monarchy, were not embodied in the treaty, but became from\r\nthis time understood possibilities.\r\n\r\n[Policy of Prussia.]\r\n\r\n[Prussia neutral.]\r\n\r\nEngland and Russia had, however, some difficulty in securing allies.\r\nAlthough in violation of his promises to Austria, Napoleon had accepted the\r\ntitle of King of Italy from the Senate of the Italian Republic, and had\r\ncrowned himself with the Iron Crown of Lombardy (March, 1805), the\r\nMinisters at Vienna would have preferred peace, if that had been possible;\r\nand their master reluctantly consented to a war against Napoleon when war\r\nin some form or other seemed inevitable. The policy of Prussia was\r\ndoubtful. For two years past Napoleon had made every effort to induce\r\nPrussia to enter into alliance with himself. After the invasion of Hanover\r\nhe had doubled his attentions to the Court of Berlin, and had spared\r\nnothing in the way of promises and assurances of friendship to win the King\r\nover to his side. The neutrality of Prussia was of no great service to\r\nFrance: its support would have been of priceless value, rendering any\r\nattack upon France by Russia or Austria almost impossible, and thus\r\nenabling Napoleon to throw his whole strength into the combat with Great\r\nBritain. In the spring of 1804, the King of Prussia, uncertain of the\r\nfriendship of the Czar, and still unconvinced of the vanity of Napoleon's\r\nprofessions, had inclined to a defensive alliance with France. The news of\r\nthe murder of the Duke of Enghien, arriving almost simultaneously with a\r\nmessage of goodwill from St. Petersburg, led him to abandon this project of\r\nalliance, but caused no breach with Napoleon. Frederick William adhered to\r\nthe temporising policy which Prussia had followed since 1795, and the\r\nForeign Minister, Haugwitz, who had recommended bolder measures, withdrew\r\nfor a time from the Court. [108] Baron Hardenberg, who had already acted as\r\nhis deputy, stepped into his place. Hardenberg, the negotiator of the peace\r\nof Basle, had for the last ten years advocated a system of neutrality. A\r\npolitician quick to grasp new social and political ideas, he was without\r\nthat insight into the real forces at work in Europe which, in spite of\r\nerrors in detail, made the political aims of Pitt, and of many far inferior\r\nmen, substantially just and correct. So late as the end of the year 1804,\r\nHardenberg not only failed to recognise the dangers to which Prussia was\r\nexposed from Napoleon's ambition, but conceived it to be still possible for\r\nPrussia to avert war between France and the Allied Powers by maintaining a\r\ngood understanding with all parties alike. Hardenberg's neutrality excited\r\nthe wrath of the Russian Cabinet. While Metternich, the Austrian ambassador\r\nat Berlin, cautiously felt his way, the Czar proposed in the last resort to\r\nforce Prussia to take up arms. A few months more passed; and, when\r\nhostilities were on the point of breaking out, Hanover was definitely\r\noffered to Prussia by Napoleon as the price of an alliance. Hardenberg,\r\nstill believing that it lay within the power of Prussia, by means of a\r\nFrench alliance, both to curb Napoleon and to prevent a European war, urged\r\nthe King to close with the offer of the French Emperor. [109] But the King\r\nshrank from a decision which involved the possibility of immediate war. The\r\noffer of Hanover was rejected, and Prussia connected itself neither with\r\nNapoleon nor his enemies.\r\n\r\n[State of Austria. The army.]\r\n\r\nPitt, the author of the Coalition of 1805, had formed the most sanguine\r\nestimate of the armaments of his allies. Austria was said to have entered\r\nupon a new era since the peace of Lunéville, and to have turned to the best\r\naccount all the disasters of its former campaigns. There had indeed been no\r\nwant of fine professions from Vienna, but Pitt knew little of the real\r\nstate of affairs. The Archduke Charles had been placed at the head of the\r\nmilitary administration, and entrusted with extraordinary powers; but the\r\nwhole force of routine and corruption was ranged against him. He was\r\ndeceived by his subordinates; and after three years of reorganisation he\r\nresigned his post, confessing that he left the army no nearer efficiency\r\nthan it was before. Charles was replaced at the War Office by General Mack.\r\nWithin six months this bustling charlatan imagined himself to have effected\r\nthe reorganisation of which the Archduke despaired, [110] while he had in\r\nfact only introduced new confusion into an army already hampered beyond any\r\nin Europe by its variety of races and languages.\r\n\r\n[Political condition of Austria.]\r\n\r\nIf the military reforms of Austria were delusive, its political reforms\r\nwere still more so. The Emperor had indeed consented to unite the\r\nMinisters, who had hitherto worked independently, in a Council of State;\r\nbut here reform stopped. Cobenzl, who was now First Minister, understood\r\nnothing but diplomacy. Men continued in office whose presence was an\r\ninsuperable bar to any intelligent action: even in that mechanical routine\r\nwhich, in the eyes of the Emperor Francis, constituted the life of the\r\nState, everything was antiquated and self-contradictory. In all that\r\naffected the mental life of the people the years that followed the peace of\r\nLunéville were distinctly retrograde. Education was placed more than ever\r\nin the hands of the priests; the censorship of the press was given to the\r\npolice; a commission was charged with the examination of all the books\r\nprinted during the reign of the Emperor Joseph, and above two thousand\r\nworks, which had come into being during that brief period of Austrian\r\nliberalism, were suppressed and destroyed. Trade regulations were issued\r\nwhich combined the extravagance of the French Reign of Terror with the\r\nignorance of the Middle Ages. All the grain in the country was ordered to\r\nbe sold before a certain date, and the Jews were prohibited from carrying\r\non the corn-trade for a year. Such were the reforms described by Pitt in\r\nthe English Parliament as having effected the regeneration of Austria.\r\nNearer home things were judged in a truer light. Mack's paper-regiments,\r\nthe helplessness and unreality of the whole system of Austrian officialism,\r\nwere correctly appreciated by the men who had been most in earnest during\r\nthe last war. Even Thugut now thought a contest hopeless. The Archduke\r\nCharles argued to the end for peace, and entered upon the war with the\r\npresentiment of defeat and ruin.\r\n\r\n[Plans of campaign, 1805.]\r\n\r\nThe plans of the Allies for the campaign of 1805 covered an immense field.\r\n[111] It was intended that one Austrian army should operate in Lombardy\r\nunder the Archduke Charles, while a second, under General Mack, entered\r\nBavaria, and there awaited the arrival of the Russians, who were to unite\r\nwith it in invading France: British and Russian contingents were to combine\r\nwith the King of Sweden in Pomerania, and with the King of Naples in\r\nSouthern Italy. At the head-quarters of the Allies an impression prevailed\r\nthat Napoleon was unprepared for war. It was even believed that his\r\ncharacter had lost something of its energy under the influence of an\r\nImperial Court. Never was there a more fatal illusion. The forces of France\r\nhad never been so overwhelming; the plans of Napoleon had never been worked\r\nout with greater minuteness and certainty. From Hanover to Strasburg masses\r\nof troops had been collected upon the frontier in readiness for the order\r\nto march; and, before the campaign opened, the magnificent army of\r\nBoulogne, which had been collected for the invasion of England, was thrown\r\ninto the scale against Austria.\r\n\r\n[Failure of Napoleon's naval designs against England.]\r\n\r\n[Nelson and Villeneuve, April-June, 1805.]\r\n\r\nEvents had occurred at sea which frustrated Napoleon's plan for an attack\r\nupon Great Britain. This attack, which in 1797 had been but lightly\r\nthreatened, had, upon the renewal of war with England in 1803, become the\r\nobject of Napoleon's most serious efforts. An army was concentrated at\r\nBoulogne sufficient to overwhelm the military forces of England, if once it\r\ncould reach the opposite shore. Napoleon's thoughts were centred on a plan\r\nfor obtaining the naval superiority in the Channel, if only for the few\r\nhours which it would take to transport the army from Boulogne to the\r\nEnglish coast. It was his design to lure Nelson to the other side of the\r\nAtlantic by a feigned expedition against the West Indies, and, during the\r\nabsence of the English admiral, to unite all the fleets at present lying\r\nblockaded in the French ports, as a cover for the invading armament.\r\nAdmiral Villeneuve was ordered to sail to Martinique, and, after there\r\nmeeting with some other ships, to re-cross the Atlantic with all possible\r\nspeed, and liberate the fleets blockaded in Ferrol, Brest, and Rochefort.\r\nThe junction of the fleets would give Napoleon a force of fifty sail in the\r\nBritish Channel, a force more than sufficient to overpower all the\r\nsquadrons which Great Britain could possibly collect for the defence of its\r\nshores. Such a design exhibited all the power of combination which marked\r\nNapoleon's greatest triumphs; but it required of an indifferent marine the\r\nprecision and swiftness of movement which belonged to the land-forces of\r\nFrance; it assumed in the seamen of Great Britain the same absence of\r\nresource which Napoleon had found among the soldiers of the Continent. In\r\nthe present instance, however, Napoleon had to deal with a man as far\r\nsuperior to all the admirals of France as Napoleon himself was to the\r\ngenerals of Austria and Prussia. Villeneuve set sail for the West Indies in\r\nthe spring of 1805, and succeeded in drawing Nelson after him; but, before\r\nhe could re-cross the Atlantic, Nelson, incessantly pursuing the French\r\nsquadron in the West-Indian seas, and at length discovering its departure\r\nhomewards at Antigua (June 13), had warned the English Government of\r\nVilleneuve's movement by a message sent in the swiftest of the English\r\nbrigs. [112] The Government, within twenty-four hours of receiving Nelson's\r\nmessage, sent orders to Sir Robert Calder instantly to raise the blockades\r\nof Ferrol and Rochefort, and to wait for Villeneuve off Cape Finisterre.\r\nHere Villeneuve met the English fleet (July 22). He was worsted in a\r\npartial engagement, and retired into the harbour of Ferrol. The pressing\r\norders of Napoleon forced the French admiral, after some delay, to attempt\r\nthat movement on Brest and Rochefort on which the whole plan of the\r\ninvasion of England depended. But Villeneuve was no longer in a condition\r\nto meet the English force assembled against him. He put back without\r\nfighting, and retired to Cadiz. All hope of carrying out the attack upon\r\nEngland was lost.\r\n\r\n[March of French armies on Bavaria, Sept.]\r\n\r\nIt only remained for Napoleon to avenge himself upon Austria through the\r\narmy which was baulked of its English prey. On the 1st of September, when\r\nthe Austrians were now on the point of crossing the Inn, the camp of\r\nBoulogne was broken up. The army turned eastwards, and distributed itself\r\nover all the roads leading from the Channel to the Rhine and the Upper\r\nDanube. Far on the north-east the army of Hanover, commanded by Bernadotte,\r\nmoved as its left wing, and converged upon a point in Southern Germany\r\nhalf-way between the frontiers of France and Austria. In the fables that\r\nlong disguised the true character of every action of Napoleon, the\r\nadmirable order of march now given to the French armies appears as the\r\ninspiration of a moment, due to the rebound of Napoleon's genius after\r\nlearning the frustration of all his naval plans. In reality, the employment\r\nof the \"Army of England\" against a Continental coalition had always been an\r\nalternative present to Napoleon's mind; and it was threateningly mentioned\r\nin his letters at a time when Villeneuve's failure was still unknown.\r\n\r\n[Austrians invade Bavaria, Sept. 8.]\r\n\r\nThe only advantage which the Allies derived from the remoteness of the\r\nChannel army was that Austria was able to occupy Bavaria without\r\nresistance. General Mack, who was charged with this operation, crossed the\r\nInn on the 8th of September. The Elector of Bavaria was known to be\r\nsecretly hostile to the Coalition. The design of preventing his union with\r\nthe French was a correct one; but in the actual situation of the allied\r\narmies it was one that could not be executed without great risk. The\r\npreparations of Russia required more time than was allowed for them; no\r\nRussian troops could reach the Inn before the end of October; and, in\r\nconsequence, the entire force operating in Western Germany did not exceed\r\nseventy thousand men. Any doubts, however, as to the prudence of an advance\r\nthrough Bavaria were silenced by the assurance that Napoleon had to bring\r\nthe bulk of his army from the British Channel. [113] In ignorance of the\r\nreal movements of the French, Mack pushed on to the western limit of\r\nBavaria, and reached the river Iller, the border of Würtemberg, where he\r\nintended to stand on the defensive until the arrival of the Russians.\r\n\r\n[Mack at Ulm, October.]\r\n\r\n[Capitulation of Ulm, Oct. 17.]\r\n\r\nHere, in the first days of October, he became aware of the presence of\r\nFrench troops, not only in front but to the east of his own position.\r\nWith some misgiving as to the situation of the enemy, Mack nevertheless\r\nrefused to fall back from Ulm. Another week revealed the true state of\r\naffairs. Before the Russians were anywhere near Bavaria, the vanguard of\r\nNapoleon's Army of the Channel and the Army of Hanover had crossed\r\nNorth-Western Germany, and seized the roads by which Mack had advanced\r\nfrom Vienna. Every hour that Mack remained in Ulm brought new divisions\r\nof the French into the Bavarian towns and villages behind him. Escape was\r\nonly possible by a retreat into the Tyrol, or by breaking through the\r\nFrench line while it was yet incompletely formed. Resolute action might\r\nstill have saved the Austrian army; but the only energy that was shown\r\nwas shown in opposition to the general. The Archduke Ferdinand, who was\r\nthe titular commander-in-chief, cut his way through the French with part\r\nof the cavalry; Mack remained in Ulm, and the iron circle closed around\r\nhim. At the last moment, after the hopelessness of the situation had\r\nbecome clear even to himself, Mack was seized by an illusion that some\r\ngreat disaster had befallen the French in their rear, and that in the\r\ncourse of a few days Napoleon would be in full retreat. \"Let no man utter\r\nthe word 'Surrender'\"--he proclaimed in an order of October 15th--\"the\r\nenemy is in the most fearful straits; it is impossible that he can\r\ncontinue more than a few days in the neighbourhood. If provisions run\r\nshort, we have three thousand horses to nourish us.\" \"I myself,\" continued\r\nthe general, \"will be the first to eat horseflesh.\" Two days later the\r\ninevitable capitulation took place; and Mack with 25,000 men, fell into the\r\nhands of the enemy without striking a blow. A still greater number of the\r\nAustrians outside Ulm surrendered in detachments. [114]\r\n\r\n[Trafalgar, Oct. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Effects.]\r\n\r\nAll France read with wonder Napoleon's bulletins describing the capture of\r\nan entire army and the approaching presentation of forty Austrian standards\r\nto the Senate at Paris. No imperial rhetoric acquainted the nation with an\r\nevent which, within four days of the capitulation of Ulm, inflicted a\r\nheavier blow on France than Napoleon himself had ever dealt to any\r\nadversary. On the 21st of October Nelson's crowning victory of Trafalgar,\r\nwon over Villeneuve venturing out from Cadiz, annihilated the combined\r\nfleets of France and Spain. Nelson fell in the moment of his triumph; but\r\nthe work which his last hours had achieved was one to which years prolonged\r\nin glory could have added nothing. He had made an end of the power of\r\nFrance upon the sea. Trafalgar was not only the greatest naval victory, it\r\nwas the greatest and most momentous victory won either by land or by sea\r\nduring the whole of the Revolutionary War. No victory, and no series of\r\nvictories, of Napoleon produced the same effect upon Europe. Austria was in\r\narms within five years of Marengo, and within four years of Austerlitz;\r\nPrussia was ready to retrieve the losses of Jena in 1813; a generation\r\npassed after Trafalgar before France again seriously threatened England at\r\nsea. The prospect of crushing the British navy, so long as England had the\r\nmeans to equip a navy, vanished: Napoleon henceforth set his hopes on\r\nexhausting England's resources by compelling every State on the Continent\r\nto exclude her commerce. Trafalgar forced him to impose his yoke upon all\r\nEurope, or to abandon the hope of conquering Great Britain. If national\r\nlove and pride have idealised in our great sailor a character which, with\r\nits Homeric force and freshness, combined something of the violence and the\r\nself-love of the heroes of a rude age, the common estimate of Nelson's work\r\nin history is not beyond the truth. So long as France possessed a navy,\r\nNelson sustained the spirit of England by his victories; his last triumph\r\nleft England in such a position that no means remained to injure her but\r\nthose which must result in the ultimate deliverance of the Continent.\r\n\r\n[Treaty of Potsdam, Nov. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Violation of Prussian territory.]\r\n\r\nThe consequences of Trafalgar lay in the future; the military situation in\r\nGermany after Mack's catastrophe was such that nothing could keep the army\r\nof Napoleon out of Vienna. In the sudden awakening of Europe to its danger,\r\none solitary gleam of hope appeared in the attitude of the Prussian Court.\r\nNapoleon had not scrupled, in his anxiety for the arrival of the Army of\r\nHanover, to order Bernadotte, its commander, to march through the Prussian\r\nterritory of Anspach, which lay on his direct route towards Ulm. It was\r\nsubsequently alleged by the Allies that Bernadotte's violation of Prussian\r\nneutrality had actually saved him from arriving too late to prevent Mack's\r\nescape; but, apart from all imaginary grounds of reproach, the insult\r\noffered to Prussia by Napoleon was sufficient to incline even Frederick\r\nWilliam to decided action. Some weeks earlier the approach of Russian\r\nforces to his frontier had led Frederick William to arm; the French had now\r\nmore than carried out what the Russians had only suggested. When the\r\noutrage was made known to the King of Prussia, that cold and reserved\r\nmonarch displayed an emotion which those who surrounded him had seldom\r\nwitnessed. [115] The Czar was forthwith offered a free passage for his\r\narmies through Silesia; and, before the news of Mack's capitulation reached\r\nthe Russian frontier, Alexander himself was on the way to Berlin. The\r\nresult of the deliberations of the two monarchs was the Treaty of Potsdam,\r\nsigned on November 3rd. By this treaty Prussia undertook to demand from\r\nNapoleon an indemnity for the King of Piedmont, and the evacuation of\r\nGermany, Switzerland, and Holland: failing Napoleon's acceptance of\r\nPrussia's mediation upon these terms, Prussia engaged to take the field\r\nwith 180,000 men.\r\n\r\n[French enter Vienna, Nov. 13.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon was now close upon Vienna. A few days after the capitulation of\r\nUlm thirty thousand Russians, commanded by General Kutusoff, had reached\r\nBavaria; but Mack's disaster rendered it impossible to defend the line of\r\nthe Inn, and the last detachments of the Allies disappeared as soon as\r\nNapoleon's vanguard approached the river. The French pushed forth in\r\noverpowering strength upon the capital. Kutusoff and the weakened Austrian\r\narmy could neither defend Vienna nor meet the invader in the field. It was\r\nresolved to abandon the city, and to unite the retreating forces on the\r\nnorthern side of the Danube with a second Russian army now entering\r\nMoravia. On the 7th of November the Court quitted Vienna. Six days later\r\nthe French entered the capital, and by an audacious stratagem of Murat's\r\ngained possession of the bridge connecting the city with the north bank of\r\nthe Danube, at the moment when the Austrian gunners were about to blow it\r\ninto the air. [116] The capture of this bridge deprived the allied army of\r\nthe last object protecting it from Napoleon's pursuit. Vienna remained in\r\nthe possession of the French. All the resources of a great capital were now\r\nadded to the means of the conqueror; and Napoleon prepared to follow his\r\nretreating adversary beyond the Danube, and to annihilate him before he\r\ncould reach his supports.\r\n\r\n[The Allies and Napoleon in Moravia, Nov.]\r\n\r\nThe retreat of the Russian army into Moravia was conducted with great skill\r\nby General Kutusoff, who retorted upon Murat the stratagem practised at the\r\nbridge of Vienna, and by means of a pretended armistice effected his\r\njunction with the newly-arrived Russian corps between Olmütz and Brünn.\r\nNapoleon's anger at the escape of his prey was shown in the bitterness of\r\nhis attacks upon Murat. The junction of the allied armies in Moravia had in\r\nfact most seriously altered the prospects of the war. For the first time\r\nsince the opening of the campaign, the Allies had concentrated a force\r\nsuperior in numbers to anything that Napoleon could bring against it. It\r\nwas impossible for Napoleon, while compelled to protect himself on the\r\nItalian side, to lead more than 70,000 men into Moravia. The Allies had now\r\n80,000 in camp, with the prospect of receiving heavy reinforcements. The\r\nwar, which lately seemed to be at its close, might now, in the hands of a\r\nskilful general, be but beginning. Although the lines of Napoleon's\r\ncommunication with France were well guarded, his position in the heart of\r\nEurope exposed him to many perils; the Archduke Charles had defeated\r\nMassena at Caldiero on the Adige, and was hastening northwards; above all,\r\nthe army of Prussia was preparing to enter the field. Every mile that\r\nNapoleon advanced into Moravia increased the strain upon his resources;\r\nevery day that postponed the decision of the campaign brought new strength\r\nto his enemies. Merely to keep the French in their camp until a Prussian\r\nforce was ready to assail their communications seemed enough to ensure the\r\nAllies victory; and such was the counsel of Kutusoff, who made war in the\r\ntemper of the wariest diplomatist. But the scarcity of provisions was\r\ntelling upon the discipline of the army, and the Czar was eager for battle.\r\n[117] The Emperor Francis gave way to the ardour of his allies. Weyrother,\r\nthe Austrian chief of the staff, drew up the most scientific plans for a\r\ngreat victory that had ever been seen even at the Austrian head-quarters;\r\nand towards the end of November it was agreed by the two Emperors that the\r\nallied army should march right round Napoleon's position near Brünn, and\r\nfight a battle with the object of cutting off his retreat upon Vienna.\r\n\r\n[Haugwitz comes with Prussian demands to Napoleon, Nov. 28.]\r\n\r\n[Haugwitz goes away to Vienna.]\r\n\r\nIt was in the days immediately preceding the intended battle, and after\r\nNapoleon had divined the plans of his enemy, that Count Haugwitz, bearing\r\nthe demands of the Cabinet of Berlin, reached the French camp at Brünn.\r\n[118] Napoleon had already heard something of the Treaty of Potsdam, and\r\nwas aware that Haugwitz had started from Berlin. He had no intention of\r\nmaking any of those concessions which Prussia required; at the same time it\r\nwas of vital importance to him to avoid the issue of a declaration of war\r\nby Prussia, which would nerve both Austria and Russia to the last\r\nextremities. He therefore resolved to prevent Haugwitz by every possible\r\nmethod from delivering his ultimatum, until a decisive victory over the\r\nallied armies should have entirely changed the political situation. The\r\nPrussian envoy himself played into Napoleon's hands. Haugwitz had obtained\r\na disgraceful permission from his sovereign to submit to all Napoleon's\r\nwishes, if, before his arrival, Austria should be separately treating for\r\npeace; and he had an excuse for delay in the fact that the military\r\npreparations of Prussia were not capable of being completed before the\r\nmiddle of December. He passed twelve days on the journey from Berlin, and\r\npresented himself before Napoleon on the 28th of November. The Emperor,\r\nafter a long conversation, requested that he would proceed to Vienna and\r\ntransact business with Talleyrand. He was weak enough to permit himself to\r\nbe removed to a distance with his ultimatum to Napoleon undelivered. When\r\nnext the Prussian Government heard of their envoy, he was sauntering in\r\nTalleyrand's drawing-rooms at Vienna, with the cordon of the French Legion\r\nof Honour on his breast, exchanging civilities with officials who politely\r\ndeclined to enter upon any question of business.\r\n\r\n[Austerlitz, Dec. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Armistice, Dec. 4.]\r\n\r\nHaugwitz once removed to Vienna, and the Allies thus deprived of the\r\ncertainty that Prussia would take the field, Napoleon trusted that a single\r\ngreat defeat would suffice to break up the Coalition. The movements of the\r\nAllies were exactly those which he expected and desired. He chose his own\r\npositions between Brünn and Austerlitz in the full confidence of victory;\r\nand on the morning of the 2nd of December, when the mists disappeared\r\nbefore a bright wintry sun, he saw with the utmost delight that the Russian\r\ncolumns were moving round him in a vast arc, in execution of the\r\nturning-movement of which he had forewarned his own army on the day before.\r\nNapoleon waited until the foremost columns were stretched far in advance of\r\ntheir supports; then, throwing Soult's division upon the gap left in the\r\ncentre of the allied line, he cut the army into halves, and crushed its\r\nsevered divisions at every point along the whole line of attack. The\r\nAllies, although they outnumbered Napoleon, believed themselves to be\r\noverpowered by an army double their own size. The incoherence of the allied\r\nmovements was as marked as the unity and effectiveness of those of the\r\nFrench. It was alleged in the army that Kutusoff, the commander-in-chief,\r\nhad fallen asleep while the Austrian Weyrother was expounding his plans for\r\nthe battle; a truer explanation of the palpable errors in the allied\r\ngeneralship was that the Russian commander had been forced by the Czar to\r\ncarry out a plan of which he disapproved. The destruction in the ranks of\r\nthe Allies was enormous, for the Russians fought with the same obstinacy as\r\nat the Trebbia and at Novi. Austria had lost a second army in addition to\r\nits capital; and the one condition which could have steeled its Government\r\nagainst all thoughts of peace--the certainty of an immediate Prussian\r\nattack upon Napoleon--had vanished with the silent disappearance of the\r\nPrussian envoy. Two days after the battle, the Emperor Francis met his\r\nconqueror in the open field, and accepted an armistice, which involved the\r\nwithdrawal of the Russian army from his dominions.\r\n\r\n[Haugwitz signs Treaty with Napoleon, Dec. 15.]\r\n\r\nYet even now the Czar sent appeals to Berlin for help, and the negotiation\r\nbegun by Austria would possibly have been broken off if help had been\r\ngiven. But the Cabinet of Frederick William had itself determined to evade\r\nits engagements; and as soon as the news of Austerlitz reached Vienna,\r\nHaugwitz had gone over heart and soul to the conqueror. While negotiations\r\nfor peace were carried on between France and Austria, a parallel\r\nnegotiation was carried on with the envoy of Prussia; and even before the\r\nEmperor Francis gave way to the conqueror's demands, Haugwitz signed a\r\ntreaty with Napoleon at Schönbrunn, by which Prussia, instead of attacking\r\nNapoleon, entered into an alliance with him, and received from him in\r\nreturn the dominion of Hanover (December 15, 1805). [119] Had Prussia been\r\nthe defeated power at Austerlitz, the Treaty of Schönbrunn could not have\r\nmore completely reversed the policy to which King Frederick William had\r\npledged himself six weeks before. While Haugwitz was making his pact with\r\nNapoleon, Hardenberg had been arranging with an English envoy for the\r\ncombination of English and Russian forces in Northern Germany. [120]\r\n\r\nThere were some among the King's advisers who declared that the treaty must\r\nbe repudiated, and the envoy disgraced. But the catastrophe of Austerlitz,\r\nand the knowledge that the Government of Vienna was entering upon a\r\nseparate negotiation, had damped the courage of the men in power. The\r\nconduct of Haugwitz was first excused, then supported, then admired. The\r\nDuke of Brunswick disgraced himself by representing to the French\r\nAmbassador in Berlin that the whole course of Prussian policy since the\r\nbeginning of the campaign had been an elaborate piece of dissimulation in\r\nthe interest of France. The leaders of the patriotic party in the army\r\nfound themselves without influence or following; the mass of the nation\r\nlooked on with the same stupid unconcern with which it had viewed every\r\nevent of the last twenty years. The King finally decided that the treaty by\r\nwhich Haugwitz had thrown the obligations of his country to the winds\r\nshould be ratified, with certain modifications, including one that should\r\nnominally reserve to King George III. a voice in the disposal of Hanover.\r\n[121]\r\n\r\n[Treaty of Presburg, Dec. 27.]\r\n\r\n[End of the Holy Roman Empire, Aug. 6, 1806.]\r\n\r\nTen days after the departure of the Prussian envoy from Vienna, peace was\r\nconcluded between France and Austria by the Treaty of Presburg [122]\r\n(December 27). At the outbreak of the war Napoleon had declared to his army\r\nthat he would not again spare Austria, as he had spared her at Campo Formio\r\nand at Lunéville; and he kept his word. The Peace of Presburg left the\r\nAustrian State in a condition very different from that in which it had\r\nemerged from the two previous wars. The Treaty of Campo Formio had only\r\ndeprived Austria of Belgium in order to replace it by Venice; the\r\nSettlement of Lunéville had only substituted French for Austrian influence\r\nin Western Germany: the Treaty that followed the battle of Austerlitz\r\nwrested from the House of Hapsburg two of its most important provinces, and\r\ncut it off at once from Italy, from Switzerland, and from the Rhine.\r\nVenetia was ceded to Napoleon's kingdom of Italy; the Tyrol was ceded to\r\nBavaria; the outlying districts belonging to Austria in Western Germany\r\nwere ceded to Baden and to Würtemberg. Austria lost 28,000 square miles of\r\nterritory and 3,000,000 inhabitants. The Emperor recognised the sovereignty\r\nand independence of Bavaria, Baden, and Würtemberg, and renounced all\r\nrights over those countries as head of the Germanic Body. The Electors of\r\nBavaria and Würtemberg, along with a large increase of territory, received\r\nthe title of King. The constitution of the Empire ceased to exist even in\r\nname. It only remained for its chief, the successor of the Roman Cæsars, to\r\nabandon his title at Napoleon's bidding; and on the 6th of August, 1806, an\r\nAct, published by Francis II. at Vienna, made an end of the outworn and\r\ndishonoured fiction of a Holy Roman Empire.\r\n\r\n[Naples given to Joseph Bonaparte.]\r\n\r\nThough Russia had not made peace with Napoleon, the European Coalition was\r\nat an end. Now, as in 1801, the defeat of the Austrian armies left the\r\nNeapolitan Monarchy to settle its account with the conqueror. Naples had\r\nstruck no blow; but it was only through the delays of the Allies that the\r\nNeapolitan army had not united with an English and a Russian force in an\r\nattack upon Lombardy. What had been pardoned in 1801 was now avenged upon\r\nthe Bourbon despot of Naples and his Austrian Queen, who from the first had\r\nshown such bitter enmity to France. Assuming the character of a judge over\r\nthe sovereigns of Europe, Napoleon pronounced from Vienna that the House of\r\nNaples had ceased to reign (Dec. 27, 1805). The sentence was immediately\r\ncarried into execution. Ferdinand fled, as he had fled in 1798, to place\r\nhimself under the protection of the navy of Great Britain. The vacant\r\nthrone was given by Napoleon to his own brother, Joseph Bonaparte.\r\nFerdinand, with the help of the English fleet, maintained himself in\r\nSicily. A thread of sea two miles broad was sufficient barrier against the\r\nPower which had subdued half the Continent; and no attempt was made either\r\nby Napoleon or his brother to gain a footing beyond the Straits of Messina.\r\nIn Southern Italy the same fanatical movements took place among the\r\npeasantry as in the previous period of French occupation. When the armies\r\nof Austria and Russia were crushed, and the continent lay at the mercy of\r\nFrance, Great Britain imagined that it could effect something against\r\nNapoleon in a corner of Italy, with the help of some ferocious villagers. A\r\nBritish force, landing near Maida, on the Calabrian coast, in the summer of\r\n1806, had the satisfaction of defeating the French at the point of the\r\nbayonet, of exciting a horde of priests and brigands to fruitless\r\nbarbarities, and of abandoning them to their well-merited chastisement.\r\n\r\n[Battle of Maida, July 6, 1806.]\r\n\r\n[The Empire. Napoleonic dynasty and titles.]\r\n\r\nThe elevation of Napoleon's brother Joseph to the throne of Naples was the\r\nfirst of a series of appointments now made by Napoleon in the character of\r\nEmperor of the West. He began to style himself the new Charlemagne; his\r\nthoughts and his language were filled with pictures of universal\r\nsovereignty; his authority, as a military despot who had crushed his\r\nneighbours, became strangely confused in his own mind with that half-sacred\r\nright of the Cæsars from which the Middle Ages derived all subordinate\r\nforms of power. He began to treat the government of the different countries\r\nof Western Europe as a function to be exercised by delegation from himself.\r\nEven the territorial grants which under the Feudal System accompanied\r\nmilitary or civil office were now revived and the commander of a French\r\narmy-corps or the chief of the French Foreign Office became the titular\r\nlord of some obscure Italian principality. [123] Napoleon's own family were\r\nto reign in many lands, as the Bourbons and the Hapsburgs had reigned\r\nbefore them, but in strict dependence on their head. Joseph Bonaparte had\r\nnot long been installed at Naples when his brother Louis was compelled to\r\naccept the Crown of Holland. Jerome, for whom no kingdom was at present\r\nvacant, was forced to renounce his American wife, in order that he might\r\nmarry the daughter of the King of Würtemberg. Eugène Beauharnais,\r\nNapoleon's step-son, held the office of Viceroy of Italy; Murat, who had\r\nmarried Napoleon's sister, had the German Duchy of Berg. Bernadotte,\r\nTalleyrand, and Berthier found themselves suzerains of districts whose\r\nnames were almost unknown to them. Out of the revenues of Northern Italy a\r\nyearly sum was reserved as an endowment for the generals whom the Emperor\r\nchose to raise to princely honours.\r\n\r\n[Federation of the Rhine.]\r\n\r\nMore statesmanlike, more practical than Napoleon's dynastic policy, was his\r\norganisation of Western Germany under its native princes as a dependency of\r\nFrance. The object at which all French politicians had aimed since the\r\noutbreak of the Revolutionary War, the exclusion of both Austria and\r\nPrussia from influence in Western Germany, was now completely attained. The\r\ntriumph of French statesmanship, the consummation of two centuries of\r\nGerman discord, was seen in the Act of Federation subscribed by the Western\r\nGerman Sovereigns in the summer of 1806. By this Act the Kings of Bavaria\r\nand Würtemberg, the Elector of Baden, and thirteen minor princes, united\r\nthemselves, in the League known as the Rhenish Confederacy, under the\r\nprotection of the French Emperor, and undertook to furnish contingents,\r\namounting to 63,000 men, in all wars in which the French Empire should\r\nengage. Their connection with the ancient Germanic Body was completely\r\nsevered; the very town in which the Diet of the Empire had held its\r\nmeetings was annexed by one of the members of the Confederacy. The\r\nConfederacy itself, with a population of 8,000,000, became for all purposes\r\nof war and foreign policy a part of France. Its armies were organised by\r\nFrench officers; its frontiers were fortified by French engineers; its\r\ntreaties were made for it at Paris. In the domestic changes which took\r\nplace within these States the work of consolidation begun in 1801 was\r\ncarried forward with increased vigour. Scores of tiny principalities which\r\nhad escaped dissolution in the earlier movement were now absorbed by their\r\nstronger neighbours. Governments became more energetic, more orderly, more\r\nambitious. The princes who made themselves the vassals of Napoleon assumed\r\na more despotic power over their own subjects. Old constitutional forms\r\nwhich had imposed some check on the will of the sovereign, like the Estates\r\nof Würtemberg, were contemptuously suppressed; the careless, ineffective\r\nroutine of the last age gave place to a system of rigorous precision\r\nthroughout the public services. Military service was enforced in countries\r\nhitherto free from it. The burdens of the people became greater, but they\r\nwere more fairly distributed. The taxes were more equally levied; justice\r\nwas made more regular and more simple. A career both in the army and the\r\noffices of Government was opened to a people to whom the very conception of\r\npublic life had hitherto been unknown.\r\n\r\n[No national unity in Germany.]\r\n\r\nThe establishment of German unity in our own day after a victorious\r\nstruggle with France renders it difficult to imagine the voluntary\r\nsubmission of a great part of the race to a French sovereign, or to excuse\r\na policy which, like that of 1806, appears the opposite of everything\r\nhonourable and patriotic. But what seems strange now was not strange then.\r\nNo expression more truly describes the conditions of that period than one\r\nof the great German poet who was himself so little of a patriot. \"Germany,\"\r\nsaid Goethe, \"is not a nation.\" Germany had indeed the unity of race; but\r\nall that truly constitutes a nation, the sense of common interest, a common\r\nhistory, pride, and desire, Germany did not possess at all. Bavaria, the\r\nstrongest of the western States, attached itself to France from a\r\nwell-grounded fear of Austrian aggression. To be conquered by Austria was\r\njust as much conquest for Bavaria as to be conquered by any other Power; it\r\nwas no step to German unity, but a step in the aggrandisement of the House\r\nof Hapsburg. The interests of the Austrian House were not the interests of\r\nGermany any more than they were the interests of Croatia, or of Venice, or\r\nof Hungary. Nor, on the other hand, had Prussia yet shown a form of\r\npolitical life sufficiently attractive to lead the southern States to\r\ndesire to unite with it. Frederick's genius had indeed made him the hero of\r\nGermany, but his military system was harsh and tyrannical. In the actual\r\ncondition of Austria and Prussia, it is doubtful whether the population of\r\nthe minor States would have been happier united to these Powers than under\r\ntheir own Governments. Conquest in any case was impossible, and there was\r\nnothing to stimulate to voluntary union. It followed that the smaller\r\nStates were destined to remain without a nationality, until the violence of\r\nsome foreign Power rendered weakness an intolerable evil, and forced upon\r\nthe better minds of Germany the thought of a common Fatherland.\r\n\r\n[What German unity desirable.]\r\n\r\nThe necessity of German unity is no self-evident political truth. Holland\r\nand Switzerland in past centuries detached themselves from the Empire, and\r\nbecame independent States, with the highest advantage to themselves.\r\nIdentity of blood is no more conclusive reason for political union between\r\nHolstein and the Tyrol than between Great Britain and the United States of\r\nAmerica. The conditions which determine both the true area and the true\r\nquality of German unity are, in fact, something more complex than an\r\nethnological law or an outburst of patriotic indignation against the\r\nFrench. Where local circumstances rendered it possible for a German\r\ndistrict, after detaching itself from the race, to maintain a real national\r\nlife and defend itself from foreign conquest, there it was perhaps better\r\nthat the connection with Germany should be severed; where, as in the great\r\nmajority of minor States, independence resulted only in military\r\nhelplessness and internal stagnation, there it was better that independence\r\nshould give place to German unity. But the conditions of any tolerable\r\nunity were not present so long as Austria was the leading Power. Less was\r\nimperilled in the future of the German people by the submission of the\r\nwestern States to France than would have been lost by their permanent\r\nincorporation under Austria.\r\n\r\n[The Empire of 1806 might have been permanent.]\r\n\r\n[Limits of a possible Napoleonic Empire.]\r\n\r\nWith the establishment of the Rhenish Confederacy and the conquest of\r\nNaples, Napoleon's empire reached, but did not overpass, the limits within\r\nwhich the sovereignty of France might probably have been long maintained.\r\nIt has been usual to draw the line between the sound statesmanship and the\r\nhazardous enterprises of Napoleon at the Peace of Lunéville: a juster\r\nappreciation of the condition of Western Europe would perhaps include\r\nwithin the range of a practical, though mischievous, ideal the whole of the\r\npolitical changes which immediately followed the war of 1805, and which\r\nextended Napoleon's dominion to the Inn and to the Straits of Messina.\r\nItaly and Germany were not then what they have since become. The districts\r\nthat lay between the Rhine and the Inn were not more hostile to the\r\nforeigner than those Rhenish Provinces which so readily accepted their\r\nunion with France. The more enterprising minds in Italy found that the\r\nNapoleonic rule, with all its faults, was superior to anything that Italy\r\nhad known in recent times. If we may judge from the feeling with which\r\nNapoleon was regarded in Germany down to the middle of the year 1806, and\r\nin Italy down to a much later date, the Empire then founded might have been\r\npermanently upheld, if Napoleon had abstained from attacking other States.\r\nNo comparison can be made between the attractive power exercised by the\r\nsocial equality of France, its military glory, and its good administration,\r\nand the slow and feeble process of assimilation which went on within the\r\ndominions of Austria; yet Austria succeeded in uniting a greater variety of\r\nraces than France sought to unite in 1806. The limits of a possible France\r\nwere indeed fixed, and fixed more firmly than by any geographical line, in\r\nthe history and national character of two other peoples. France could not\r\npermanently overpower Prussia, and it could not permanently overpower\r\nSpain. But within a boundary-line drawn roughly from the mouth of the Elbe\r\nto the head of the Adriatic, that union of national sentiment and material\r\nforce which checks the formation of empires did not exist. The true\r\nturning-point in Napoleon's career was the moment when he passed beyond the\r\npolicy which had planned the Federation of the Rhine, and roused by his\r\noppression the one State which was still capable of giving a national life\r\nto Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeath of Pitt--Ministry of Fox and Grenville--Napoleon forces Prussia into\r\nWar with England, and then offers Hanover to England--Prussia resolves on\r\nWar with Napoleon--State of Prussia--Decline of the Army--Southern Germany\r\nwith Napoleon--Austria Neutral--England and Russia about to help Prussia,\r\nbut not immediately--Campaign of 1806--Battles of Jena and Auerstädt--Ruin\r\nof the Prussian Army--Capitulation of Fortresses--Demands of Napoleon--The\r\nWar continues--Berlin Decree--Exclusion of English Goods from the\r\nContinent--Russia enters the War--Campaign in Poland and East\r\nPrussia--Eylau--Treaty of Bartenstein--Friedland--Interview at\r\nTilsit--Alliance of Napoleon and Alexander--Secret Articles--English\r\nExpedition to Denmark--The French enter Portugal--Prussia after the Peace\r\nof Tilsit--Stein's Edict of Emancipation--The Prussian Peasant--Reform of\r\nthe Prussian Army, and Creation of Municipalities--Stein's other Projects\r\nof Reform, which are not carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Death of Pitt, Jan. 23rd, 1806.]\r\n\r\n[Coalition Ministry of Fox and Grenville.]\r\n\r\nSix weeks after the tidings of Austerlitz reached Great Britain, the\r\nstatesman who had been the soul of every European coalition against France\r\nwas carried to the grave. [124] Pitt passed away at a moment of the deepest\r\ngloom. His victories at sea appeared to have effected nothing; his\r\ncombinations on land had ended in disaster and ruin. If during Pitt's\r\nlifetime a just sense of the greatness and patriotism of all his aims\r\ncondoned the innumerable faults of his military administration, that\r\npersonal ascendancy which might have disarmed criticism even after the\r\ndisaster of Austerlitz belonged to no other member of his Ministry. His\r\ncolleagues felt their position to be hopeless. Though the King attempted to\r\nset one of Pitt's subordinates in the vacant place, the prospects of Europe\r\nwere too dark, the situation of the country too serious, to allow a\r\nMinistry to be formed upon the ordinary principles of party-organisation or\r\nin accordance with the personal preferences of the monarch. The nation\r\ncalled for the union of the ablest men of all parties in the work of\r\ngovernment; and, in spite of the life-long hatred of King George to Mr.\r\nFox, a Ministry entered upon office framed by Fox and Grenville conjointly;\r\nFox taking the post of Foreign Secretary, with a leading influence in the\r\nCabinet, and yielding to Grenville the title of Premier. Addington received\r\na place in the Ministry, and carried with him the support of a section of\r\nthe Tory party, which was willing to countenance a policy of peace.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon hopes to intimidate Fox through Prussia.]\r\n\r\nFox had from the first given his whole sympathy to the French Revolution,\r\nas the cause of freedom. He had ascribed the calamities of Europe to the\r\nintervention of foreign Powers in favour of the Bourbon monarchy: he had\r\npalliated the aggressions of the French Republic as the consequences of\r\nunjust and unprovoked attack: even the extinction of liberty in France\r\nitself had not wholly destroyed his faith in the honour and the generosity\r\nof the soldier of the Revolution. In the brief interval of peace which in\r\n1802 opened the Continent to English travellers, Fox had been the guest of\r\nthe First Consul. His personal feeling towards the French Government had in\r\nit nothing of that proud and suspicious hatred which made negotiation so\r\ndifficult while Pitt continued in power. It was believed at Paris, and with\r\ngood reason, that the first object of Fox on entering upon office would be\r\nthe restoration of peace. Napoleon adopted his own plan in view of the\r\nchange likely to arise in the spirit of the British Cabinet. It was his\r\nhabit, wherever he saw signs of concession, to apply more violent means of\r\nintimidation. In the present instance he determined to work upon the\r\npacific leanings of Fox by adding Prussia to the forces arrayed against\r\nGreat Britain. Prussia, isolated and discredited since the battle of\r\nAusterlitz, might first be driven into hostilities with England, and then\r\nbe made to furnish the very satisfaction demanded by England as the primary\r\ncondition of peace.\r\n\r\n[The King of Prussia wishes to disguise the cession of Hanover.]\r\n\r\n[Napoleon forces Prussia into war with England, March, 1806.]\r\n\r\nAt the moment when Napoleon heard of Pitt's death, he was expecting the\r\narrival of Count Haugwitz at Paris for the purpose of obtaining some\r\nmodification in the treaty which he had signed on behalf of Prussia after\r\nthe battle of Austerlitz. The principal feature in that treaty had been the\r\ngrant of Hanover to Prussia by the French Emperor in return for its\r\nalliance. This was the point which above all others excited King Frederick\r\nWilliam's fears and scruples. He desired to retain Hanover, but he also\r\ndesired to derive his title rather from its English owner than from its\r\nFrench invader. It was the object of Haugwitz' visit to Paris to obtain an\r\nalteration in the terms of the treaty which should make the Prussian\r\noccupation of Hanover appear to be merely provisional, and reserve to the\r\nKing of England at least a nominal voice in its ultimate transfer. In full\r\nconfidence that Napoleon would agree to such a change, the King of Prussia\r\nhad concealed the fact of its cession to himself by Napoleon, and published\r\nan untruthful proclamation, stating that, in the interests of the\r\nHanoverian people themselves, a treaty had been signed and ratified by the\r\nFrench and Prussian Governments, in virtue of which Hanover was placed\r\nunder the protection of the King of Prussia until peace should be concluded\r\nbetween Great Britain and France. The British Government received\r\nassurances of Prussia's respect for the rights of King George III.: the\r\nbitter truth that the treaty between France and Prussia contained no single\r\nword reserving the rights of the Elector, and that the very idea of\r\nqualifying the absolute cession of Hanover was an afterthought, lay hidden\r\nin the conscience of the Prussian Cabinet. Never had a Government more\r\ncompletely placed itself at the mercy of a pitiless enemy. Count Haugwitz,\r\non reaching Paris, was received by Napoleon with a storm of invective\r\nagainst the supposed partisans of England at the Prussian Court. Napoleon\r\ndeclared that the ill faith of Prussia had made an end even of that\r\nmiserable pact which had been extorted after Austerlitz, and insisted that\r\nKing Frederick William should openly defy Great Britain by closing the\r\nports of Northern Germany to British vessels, and by declaring himself\r\nendowed by Napoleon with Hanover in virtue of Napoleon's own right of\r\nconquest. Haugwitz signed a second and more humiliating treaty embodying\r\nthese conditions; and the Prussian Government, now brought into the depths\r\nof contempt, but unready for immediate war, executed the orders of its\r\nmaster. [125] A proclamation, stating that Prussia had received the\r\nabsolute dominion of Hanover from its conqueror Napoleon, gave the lie to\r\nthe earlier announcements of King Frederick William. A decree was published\r\nexcluding the ships of England from the ports of Prussia and from those of\r\nHanover itself (March 28, 1806). It was promptly answered by the seizure of\r\nfour hundred Prussian vessels in British harbours, and by the total\r\nextinction of Prussian maritime commerce by British privateers. [126]\r\n\r\n[Napoleon negotiates with Fox. Offers Hanover to England.]\r\n\r\nScarcely was Prussia committed to this ruinous conflict with Great Britain,\r\nwhen Napoleon opened negotiations for peace with Mr. Fox's Government. The\r\nfirst condition required by Great Britain was the restitution of Hanover to\r\nKing George III. It was unhesitatingly granted by Napoleon. [127] Thus was\r\nPrussia to be mocked of its prey, after it had been robbed of all its\r\nhonour. For the present, however, no rumour of this part of the negotiation\r\nreached Berlin. The negotiation itself, which dragged on through several\r\nmonths, turned chiefly upon the future ownership of Sicily. Napoleon had in\r\nthe first instance agreed that Sicily should be left in the hands of\r\nFerdinand of Naples, who had never been expelled from it by the French.\r\nFinding, however, that the Russian envoy d'Oubril, who had been sent to\r\nParis with indefinite instructions by the Emperor Alexander, was willing to\r\nseparate the cause of Russia from that of England, and to sign a separate\r\npeace, Napoleon retracted his promise relating to Sicily, and demanded that\r\nthis island should be ceded to his brother Joseph. D'Oubril signed\r\nPreliminaries on behalf of Russia on the 20th of July, and left the English\r\nnegotiator to obtain what terms he could. Fox had been willing to recognise\r\nthe order of things established by Napoleon on the Italian mainland; he\r\nwould even have ceded Sicily, if Russia had urged this in a joint\r\nnegotiation; but he was too good a statesman to be cheated out of Sicily by\r\na mere trick. He recalled the English envoy from Paris, and waited for the\r\njudgment of the Czar upon the conduct of his own representative. The Czar\r\ndisavowed d'Oubril's negotiations, and repudiated the treaty which he\r\nbrought back to St. Petersburg. Napoleon had thus completely overreached\r\nhimself, and, instead of severing Great Britain and Russia by separate\r\nagreements, had only irritated and displeased them both. The negotiations\r\nwent no further; their importance lay only in the effect which they\r\nproduced upon Prussia, when Napoleon's offer of Hanover to Great Britain\r\nbecame known at Berlin.\r\n\r\n[Prussia learns of Napoleon's offer of Hanover to England, Aug. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Prussia determines on war.]\r\n\r\nFrom the time when Haugwitz' second treaty placed his master at Napoleon's\r\nfeet, Prussia had been subjected to an unbroken series of insults and\r\nwrongs. Murat, as Duke of Berg, had seized upon territory allotted to\r\nPrussia in the distribution of the ecclesiastical lands; the establishment\r\nof a North German Confederacy under Prussian leadership was suggested by\r\nNapoleon himself, only to be summarily forbidden as soon as Prussia\r\nattempted to carry the proposal into execution. There was scarcely a\r\ncourtier in Berlin who did not feel that the yoke of the French had become\r\npast endurance; even Haugwitz himself now considered war as a question of\r\ntime. The patriotic party in the capital and the younger officers of the\r\narmy bitterly denounced the dishonoured Government, and urged the King to\r\nstrike for the credit of his country. [128] In the midst of this deepening\r\nagitation, a despatch arrived from Lucchesini, the Prussian Ambassador at\r\nParis (August 7), relating the offer of Hanover made by Napoleon to the\r\nBritish Government. For nearly three months Lucchesini had caught no\r\nglimpse of the negotiations between Great Britain and France; suddenly, on\r\nentering into conversation with the English envoy at a dinner-party, he\r\nlearnt the blow which Napoleon had intended to deal to Prussia. Lucchesini\r\ninstantly communicated with the Court of Berlin; but his despatch was\r\nopened by Talleyrand's agents before it left Paris, and the French\r\nGovernment was thus placed on its guard against the sudden explosion of\r\nPrussian wrath. Lucchesini's despatch had indeed all the importance that\r\nTalleyrand attributed to it. It brought that spasmodic access of resolution\r\nto the irresolute King which Bernadotte's violation of his territory had\r\nbrought in the year before. The whole Prussian army was ordered to prepare\r\nfor war; Brunswick was summoned to form plans of a campaign; and appeals\r\nfor help were sent to Vienna, to St. Petersburg, and even to the hostile\r\nCourt of London.\r\n\r\n[Condition of Prussia.]\r\n\r\n[Ministers not in the King's Cabinet.]\r\n\r\nThe condition of Prussia at this critical moment was one which filled with\r\nthe deepest alarm those few patriotic statesmen who were not blinded by\r\nnational vanity or by slavery to routine. The foreign policy of Prussia in\r\n1805, miserable as it was, had been but a single manifestation of the\r\nhelplessness, the moral deadness that ran through every part of its\r\nofficial and public life. Early in the year 1806 a paper was drawn up by\r\nStein, [129] exposing, in language seldom used by a statesman, the\r\ncharacter of the men by whom Frederick William was surrounded, and\r\ndeclaring that nothing but a speedy change of system could save the\r\nPrussian State from utter downfall and ruin. Two measures of immediate\r\nnecessity were specified by Stein, the establishment of a responsible\r\ncouncil of Ministers, and the removal of Haugwitz and all his friends from\r\npower. In the existing system of government the Ministers were not the\r\nmonarch's confidential advisers. The Ministers performed their work in\r\nisolation from one another; the Cabinet, or confidential council of the\r\nKing, was composed of persons holding no public function, and free from all\r\npublic responsibility. No guarantee existed that the policy of the country\r\nwould be the same for two days together. The Ministers were often unaware\r\nof the turn that affairs had taken in the Cabinet; and the history of\r\nHaugwitz' mission to Austerlitz showed that an individual might commit the\r\nState to engagements the very opposite of those which he was sent to\r\ncontract. The first necessity for Prussia was a responsible governing\r\ncouncil: with such a council, formed from the heads of the actual\r\nAdministration, the reform of the army and of the other branches of the\r\npublic service, which was absolutely hopeless under the present system,\r\nmight be attended with some chance of success.\r\n\r\n[State of the Prussian Army.]\r\n\r\n[Higher officers.]\r\n\r\nThe army of Prussia, at an epoch when the conscription and the genius of\r\nNapoleon had revolutionised the art of war, was nothing but the army of\r\nFrederick the Great grown twenty years older. [130] It was obvious to all\r\nthe world that its commissariat and marching-regulations belonged to a time\r\nwhen weeks were allowed for movements now reckoned by days; but there were\r\ncircumstances less conspicuous from the outside which had paralysed the\r\nvery spirit of soldiership, and prepared the way for a military collapse in\r\nwhich defeats in the field were the least dishonourable event. Old age had\r\nrendered the majority of the higher officers totally unfit for military\r\nservice. In that barrack-like routine of officialism which passed in\r\nPrussia for the wisdom of government, the upper ranks of the army formed a\r\nspecies of administrative corps in time of peace, and received for their\r\ncivil employment double the pay that they could earn in actual war. Aged\r\nmen, with the rank of majors, colonels, and generals, mouldered in the\r\noffices of country towns, and murmured at the very mention of a war, which\r\nwould deprive them of half their salaries. Except in the case of certain\r\nprinces, who were placed in high rank while young, and of a few vigorous\r\npatriarchs like Blücher, all the energy and military spirit of the army was\r\nto be found in men who had not passed the grade of captain. The higher\r\nofficers were, on an average, nearly double the age of French officers of\r\ncorresponding rank. [131] Of the twenty-four lieutenant-generals, eighteen\r\nwere over sixty; the younger ones, with a single exception, were princes.\r\nFive out of the seven commanders of infantry were over seventy; even the\r\nsixteen cavalry generals included only two who had not reached sixty-five.\r\nThese were the men who, when the armies of Prussia were beaten in the\r\nfield, surrendered its fortresses with as little concern as if they had\r\nbeen receiving the French on a visit of ceremony. Their vanity was as\r\nlamentable as their faint-heartedness. \"The army of his Majesty,\" said\r\nGeneral Rüchel on parade, \"possesses several generals equal to Bonaparte.\"\r\nFaults of another character belonged to the generation which had grown up\r\nsince Frederick. The arrogance and licentiousness of the younger officers\r\nwas such that their ruin on the field of Jena caused positive joy to a\r\ngreat part of the middle classes of Prussia. But, however hateful their\r\nmanners, and however rash their self-confidence, the vices of these younger\r\nmen had no direct connection with the disasters of 1806. The gallants who\r\nsharpened their swords on the window-sill of the French Ambassador received\r\na bitter lesson from the plebeian troopers of Murat; but they showed\r\ncourage in disaster, and subsequently gave to their country many officers\r\nof ability and honour.\r\n\r\n[Common soldiers.]\r\n\r\nWhat was bad in the higher grades of the army was not retrieved by any\r\nexcellence on the part of the private soldier. The Prussian army was\r\nrecruited in part from foreigners, but chiefly from Prussian serfs, who\r\nwere compelled to serve. Men remained with their regiments till old age;\r\nthe rough character of the soldiers and the frequency of crimes and\r\ndesertions occasioned the use of brutal punishments, which made the\r\nmilitary service an object of horror to the better part of the middle and\r\nlower classes. The soldiers themselves, who could be flogged and drilled\r\ninto high military perfection by a great general like Frederick, felt a\r\nsurly indifference to their present taskmasters, and were ready to desert\r\nin masses to their homes as soon as a defeat broke up the regimental muster\r\nand roll-call. A proposal made in the previous year to introduce that\r\nsystem of general service which has since made Prussia so great a military\r\npower was rejected by a committee of generals, on the ground that it \"would\r\nconvert the most formidable army of Europe into a militia.\" But whether\r\nPrussia entered the war with a militia or a regular army, under the men who\r\nheld command in 1806 it could have met with but one fate. Neither soldiery\r\nnor fortresses could have saved a kingdom whose generals knew only how to\r\ncapitulate.\r\n\r\n[Southern Germany. Execution of Palm, Aug. 26.]\r\n\r\nAll southern Germany was still in Napoleon's hands. As the probability of a\r\nwar with Prussia became greater and greater, Napoleon had tightened his\r\ngrasp upon the Confederate States. Publications originating among the\r\npatriotic circles of Austria were beginning to appeal to the German people\r\nto unite against a foreign oppressor. An anonymous pamphlet, entitled\r\n\"Germany in its Deep Humiliation,\" was sold by various booksellers in\r\nBavaria, among others by Palm, a citizen of Nuremberg. There is no evidence\r\nthat Palm was even acquainted with the contents of the pamphlet; but as in\r\nthe case of the Duke of Enghien, two years before, Napoleon had required a\r\nvictim to terrify the House of Bourbon, so now he required a victim to\r\nterrify those who among the German people might be inclined to listen to\r\nthe call of patriotism. Palm was not too obscure for the new Charlemagne.\r\nThe innocent and unoffending man, innocent even of the honourable crime of\r\nattempting to save his country, was dragged before a tribunal of French\r\nsoldiers, and executed within twenty-four hours, in pursuance of the\r\nimperative orders of Napoleon (August 26). The murder was an unnecessary\r\none, for the Bavarians and the Würtembergers were in fact content with the\r\nyoke they bore; its only effect was to arouse among a patient and\r\nhome-loving class the doubt whether the German citizen and his family might\r\nnot after all have some interest in the preservation of national\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n[Austria neutral. England and Russia can give Prussia no prompt help.]\r\n\r\nWhen, several years later, the oppressions of Napoleon had given to a great\r\npart of the German race at least the transient nobleness of a real\r\npatriotism, the story of Palm's death was one of those that kindled the\r\nbitterest sense of wrong: at the time, it exercised no influence upon the\r\ncourse of political events. Southern Germany remained passive, and supplied\r\nNapoleon with a reserve of soldiers: Prussia had to look elsewhere for\r\nallies. Its prospects of receiving support were good, if the war should\r\nprove a protracted one, but not otherwise. Austria, crippled by the\r\ndisasters of 1805, could only hope to renew the struggle if victory should\r\ndeclare against Napoleon. In other quarters help might be promised, but it\r\ncould not be given at the time and at the place where it was needed. The\r\nCzar proffered the whole forces of his Empire; King George III. forgave the\r\ndespoilers of his patrimony when he found that they really intended to\r\nfight the French; but the troops of Alexander lay far in the East, and the\r\naction of England in any Continental war was certain to be dilatory and\r\nineffective. Prussia was exposed to the first shock of the war alone. In\r\nthe existing situation of the French armies, a blow unusually swift and\r\ncrushing might well be expected by all who understood Napoleon's warfare.\r\n\r\n[Situation of the French and Prussian armies, Sept., 1806.]\r\n\r\n[French on the Main.]\r\n\r\n[Prussians on the Saale.]\r\n\r\nA hundred and seventy thousand French soldiers, with contingents from the\r\nRhenish Confederate States, lay between the Main and the Inn. The last\r\nweeks of peace, in which the Prussian Government imagined themselves to be\r\ndeceiving the enemy while they pushed forward their own preparations, were\r\nemployed by Napoleon in quietly concentrating this vast force upon the Main\r\n(September, 1806). Napoleon himself appeared to be absorbed in friendly\r\nnegotiations with General Knobelsdorff, the new Prussian Ambassador at\r\nParis. In order to lull Napoleon's suspicions, Haugwitz had recalled\r\nLucchesini from Paris, and intentionally deceived his successor as to the\r\nreal designs of the Prussian Cabinet. Knobelsdorff confidentially informed\r\nthe Emperor that Prussia was not serious in its preparations for war.\r\nNapoleon, caring very little whether Prussia intended to fight or not,\r\ncontinued at Paris in the appearance of the greatest calm, while his\r\nlieutenants in Southern Germany executed those unobserved movements which\r\nwere to collect the entire army upon the Upper Main. In the meantime the\r\nadvisers of King Frederick William supposed themselves to have made\r\neverything ready for a vigorous offensive. Divisions of the Prussian army,\r\nnumbering nearly 130,000 men, were concentrated in the neighbourhood of\r\nJena, on the Saale. The bolder spirits in the military council pressed for\r\nan immediate advance through the Thuringian Forest, and for an attack upon\r\nwhat were supposed to be the scattered detachments of the French in\r\nBavaria. Military pride and all the traditions of the Great Frederick\r\nimpelled Prussia to take the offensive rather than to wait for the enemy\r\nupon the strong line of the Elbe. Political motives pointed in the same\r\ndirection, for the support of Saxony was doubtful if once the French were\r\npermitted to approach Dresden.\r\n\r\n[Confusion of the Prussians.]\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of September King Frederick William arrived at the\r\nhead-quarters of the army, which were now at Naumburg, on the Saale. But\r\nhis presence brought no controlling mind to the direction of affairs.\r\nCouncils of war held on the two succeeding days only revealed the discord\r\nand the irresolution of the military leaders of Prussia. Brunswick, the\r\ncommander-in-chief, sketched the boldest plans, and shrank from the\r\nresponsibility of executing them. Hohenlohe, who commanded the left wing,\r\nlost no opportunity of opposing his superior; the suggestions of officers\r\nof real ability, like Scharnhorst, chief of the staff, fell unnoticed among\r\nthe wrangling of pedants and partisans. Brunswick, himself a man of great\r\nintelligence though of little resolution, saw the true quality of the men\r\nwho surrounded him. \"Rüchel,\" he cried, \"is a tin trumpet, Möllendorf a\r\ndotard, Kalkreuth a cunning trickster. The generals of division are a set\r\nof stupid journeymen. Are these the people with whom one can make war on\r\nNapoleon? No. The best service that I could render to the King would be to\r\npersuade him to keep the peace.\" [132] It was ultimately decided, after two\r\ndays of argument, that the army should advance through the Thuringian\r\nForest, while feints on the right and left deceived the French as to its\r\nreal direction. The diplomatists, however, who were mad enough to think\r\nthat an ultimatum which they had just despatched to Paris would bring\r\nNapoleon on to his knees, insisted that the opening of hostilities should\r\nbe deferred till the 8th of October, when the term of grace which they had\r\ngiven to Napoleon would expire.\r\n\r\n[Prussians at Erfurt, Oct. 4.]\r\n\r\nA few days after this decision had been formed, intelligence arrived at\r\nhead-quarters that Napoleon himself was upon the Rhine. Before the\r\nultimatum reached the hands of General Knobelsdorff in Paris, Napoleon had\r\nquitted the capital, and the astonished Ambassador could only send the\r\nultimatum in pursuit of him after he had gone to place himself at the head\r\nof 200,000 men. The news that Napoleon was actually in Mainz confounded the\r\ndiplomatists in the Prussian camp, and produced an order for an immediate\r\nadvance. This was the wisest as well as the boldest determination that had\r\nyet been formed; and an instant assault upon the French divisions on the\r\nMain might perhaps even now have given the Prussian army the superiority in\r\nthe first encounter. But some fatal excuse was always at hand to justify\r\nBrunswick in receding from his resolutions. A positive assurance was\r\nbrought into camp by Lucchesini that Napoleon had laid his plans for\r\nremaining on the defensive on the south of the Thuringian Forest. If this\r\nwere true, there might yet be time to improve the plan of the campaign; and\r\non the 4th of October, when every hour was of priceless value, the forward\r\nmarch was arrested, and a new series of deliberations began at the\r\nhead-quarters at Erfurt. In the council held on the 4th of October, a total\r\nchange in the plan of operations was urged by Hohenlohe's staff. They\r\ncontended, and rightly, that it was the design of Napoleon to pass the\r\nPrussian army on the east by the valley of the Saale, and to cut it off\r\nfrom the roads to the Elbe. The delay in Brunswick's movements had in fact\r\nbrought the French within striking distance of the Prussian communications.\r\nHohenlohe urged the King to draw back the army from Erfurt to the Saale, or\r\neven to the east of it, in order to cover the roads to Leipzig and the\r\nElbe. His theory of Napoleon's movements, which was the correct one, was\r\nadopted by the council, and the advance into the Thuringian Forest was\r\nabandoned; but instead of immediately marching eastwards with the whole\r\narmy, the generals wasted two more days in hesitations and half-measures.\r\nAt length it was agreed that Hohenlohe should take post at Jena, and that\r\nthe mass of the army should fall back to Weimar, with the object of\r\nstriking a blow at some undetermined point on the line of Napoleon's\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\n[Encounter at Saalfeld, Oct. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Napoleon defeats Hohenlohe at Jena, Oct. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Davoust defeats Brunswick at Auerstädt, Oct. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Ruin of the Prussian Army.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon, who had just received the Prussian ultimatum with unbounded\r\nridicule and contempt, was now moving along the roads that lead from\r\nBamberg and Baireuth to the Upper Saale. On the 10th of October, as the\r\ndivision of Lannes was approaching Saalfeld, it was attacked by Prince\r\nLouis Ferdinand at the head of Hohenlohe's advanced guard. The attack was\r\nmade against Hohenlohe's orders. It resulted in the total rout of the\r\nPrussian force. Though the numbers engaged were small, the loss of\r\nmagazines and artillery, and the death of Prince Louis Ferdinand, the hero\r\nof the war-party, gave to this first repulse the moral effect of a great\r\nmilitary disaster. Hohenlohe's troops at Jena were seized with panic;\r\nnumbers of men threw away their arms and dispersed; the drivers of\r\nartillery-waggons and provision-carts cut the traces and rode off with\r\ntheir horses. Brunswick, however, and the main body of the army, were now\r\nat Weimar, close at hand; and if Brunswick had decided to fight a great\r\nbattle at Jena, the Prussians might have brought nearly 90,000 men into\r\naction. But the plans of the irresolute commander were again changed. It\r\nwas resolved to fall back upon Magdeburg and the Elbe. Brunswick himself\r\nmoved northwards to Naumburg; Hohenlohe was ordered to hold the French in\r\ncheck at Jena until this movement was completed. Napoleon reached Jena. He\r\nhad no intelligence of Brunswick's retreat, and imagined the mass of the\r\nPrussian army to be gathered round Hohenlohe, on the plateau before him. He\r\nsent Davoust, with a corps 27,000 strong, to outflank the enemy by a march\r\nin the direction of Naumburg, and himself prepared to make the attack in\r\nfront with 90,000 men, a force more than double Hohenlohe's real army. The\r\nattack was made on the 14th of October. Hohenlohe's army was dashed to\r\npieces by Napoleon, and fled in wild disorder. Davoust's weak corps, which\r\nhad not expected to meet with any important forces until it fell upon\r\nHohenlohe's flank, found itself in the presence of Brunswick's main army,\r\nwhen it arrived at Auerstädt, a few miles to the north. Fortune had given\r\nto the Prussian commander an extraordinary chance of retrieving what\r\nstrategy had lost. A battle conducted with common military skill would not\r\nonly have destroyed Davoust, but have secured, at least for the larger\r\nportion of the Prussian forces, a safe retreat to Leipzig or the Elbe. The\r\nFrench general, availing himself of steep and broken ground, defeated\r\nnumbers nearly double his own through the confusion of his adversary, who\r\nsent up detachment after detachment instead of throwing himself upon\r\nDavoust with his entire strength. The fighting was as furious on the\r\nPrussian side as its conduct was unskilful. King Frederick William, who led\r\nthe earlier cavalry charges, had two horses killed under him. Brunswick was\r\nmortally wounded. Many of the other generals were killed or disabled. There\r\nremained, however, a sufficient number of unbroken regiments to preserve\r\nsome order in the retreat until the army came into contact with the remnant\r\nof Hohenlohe's forces, flying for their lives before the cavalry of Murat.\r\nThen all hope was lost. The fugitive mass struck panic and confusion into\r\nthe retreating columns; and with the exception of a few regiments which\r\ngathered round well-known leaders, the soldiers threw away their arms and\r\nspread over the country in headlong rout. There was no line of retreat, and\r\nno rallying-point. The disaster of a single day made an end of the Prussian\r\narmy as a force capable of meeting the enemy in the field. A great part of\r\nthe troops was captured by the pursuing enemy during the next few days. The\r\nregiments which preserved their coherence were too weak to make any attempt\r\nto check Napoleon's advance, and could only hope to save themselves by\r\nescaping to the fortresses on the Oder.\r\n\r\n[Haugwitz and Lord Morpeth.]\r\n\r\n[Retreat and surrender of Hohenlohe.]\r\n\r\nTwo days before the battle of Jena, an English envoy, Lord Morpeth, had\r\narrived at the head-quarters of the King of Prussia, claiming the\r\nrestoration of Hanover, and bearing an offer of the friendship and support\r\nof Great Britain. At the moment when the Prussian monarchy was on the point\r\nof being hurled to the ground, its Government might have been thought\r\nlikely to welcome any security that it should not be abandoned in its\r\nutmost need. Haugwitz, however, was at head-quarters, dictating lying\r\nbulletins, and perplexing the generals with ridiculous arguments of policy\r\nuntil the French actually opened fire. When the English envoy made known\r\nhis arrival, he found that no one would transact business with him.\r\nHaugwitz had determined to evade all negotiations until the battle had been\r\nfought. He was unwilling to part with Hanover, and he hoped that a victory\r\nover Napoleon would enable him to meet Lord Morpeth with a bolder\r\ncountenance on the following day. When that day arrived, Ministers and\r\ndiplomatists were flying headlong over the country. The King made his\r\nescape to Weimar, and wrote to Napoleon, begging for an armistice; but the\r\narmistice was refused, and the pursuit of the broken army was followed up\r\nwithout a moment's pause. The capital offered no safe halting-place; and\r\nFrederick William only rested when he had arrived at Graudenz, upon the\r\nVistula. Hohenlohe's poor remnant of an army passed the Elbe at Magdeburg,\r\nand took the road for Stettin, at the mouth of the Oder, leaving Berlin to\r\nits fate. The retreat was badly conducted; alternate halts and strained\r\nmarches discouraged the best of the soldiers. As the men passed their\r\nnative villages they abandoned the famishing and broken-spirited columns;\r\nand at the end of a fortnight's disasters Prince Hohenlohe surrendered to\r\nhis pursuers at Prenzlau with his main body, now numbering only 10,000 men\r\n(Oct. 28).\r\n\r\n[Blücher at Lübeck.]\r\n\r\nBlücher, who had shown the utmost energy and fortitude after the\r\ncatastrophe of Jena, was moving in the rear of Hohenlohe with a\r\nconsiderable force which his courage had gathered around him. On learning\r\nof Hohenlohe's capitulation, he instantly reversed his line of march, and\r\nmade for the Hanoverian fortress of Hameln, in order to continue the war in\r\nthe rear of the French. Overwhelming forces, however, cut off his retreat\r\nto the Elbe; he was hemmed in on the east and on the west; and nothing\r\nremained for him but to throw himself into the neutral town of Lübeck, and\r\nfight until food and ammunition failed him. The French were at his heels.\r\nThe magistrates of Lübeck prayed that their city might not be made into a\r\nbattle-field, but in vain; Blücher refused to move into the open country.\r\nThe town was stormed by the French, and put to the sack. Blücher was driven\r\nout, desperately fighting, and pent in between the Danish frontier and the\r\nsea. Here, surrounded by overpowering numbers, without food, without\r\nammunition, he capitulated on the 7th of November, after his courage and\r\nresolution had done everything that could ennoble both general and soldiers\r\nin the midst of overwhelming calamity.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon at Berlin, Oct. 27.]\r\n\r\n[Capitulation of Prussian fortresses.]\r\n\r\nThe honour of entering the Prussian capital was given by Napoleon to\r\nDavoust, whose victory at Auerstädt had in fact far surpassed his own.\r\nDavoust entered Berlin without resistance on the 25th of October; Napoleon\r\nhimself went to Potsdam, and carried off the sword and the scarf that lay\r\nupon the grave of Frederick the Great. Two days after Davoust, the Emperor\r\nmade his own triumphal entry into the capital. He assumed the part of the\r\nprotector of the people against the aristocracy, ordering the formation of\r\na municipal body and of a civic guard for the city of Berlin. The military\r\naristocracy he treated with the bitterest hatred and contempt. \"I will make\r\nthat noblesse,\" he cried, \"so poor that they shall beg their bread.\" The\r\ndisaster of Jena had indeed fearfully punished the insolence with which the\r\nofficers of the army had treated the rest of the nation. The Guards were\r\nmarched past the windows of the citizens of Berlin, a miserable troop of\r\ncaptives; soldiers of rank who remained in the city had to attend upon the\r\nFrench Emperor to receive his orders. But calamity was only beginning. The\r\noverthrow of Jena had been caused by faults of generalship, and cast no\r\nstain upon the courage of the officers; the surrender of the Prussian\r\nfortresses, which began on the day when the French entered Berlin, attached\r\nthe utmost personal disgrace to their commanders. Even after the\r\ndestruction of the army in the field, Prussia's situation would not have\r\nbeen hopeless if the commanders of fortresses had acted on the ordinary\r\nrules of military duty. Magdeburg and the strongholds upon the Oder were\r\nsufficiently armed and provisioned to detain the entire French army, and to\r\ngive time to the King to collect upon the Vistula a force as numerous as\r\nthat which he had lost. But whatever is weakest in human nature--old age,\r\nfear, and credulity--seemed to have been placed at the head of Prussia's\r\ndefences. The very object for which fortresses exist was forgotten; and the\r\nfact that one army had been beaten in the field was made a reason for\r\npermitting the enemy to forestall the organisation of another. Spandau\r\nsurrendered on the 25th of October, Stettin on the 29th. These were places\r\nof no great strength; but the next fortress to capitulate, Küstrin on the\r\nOder, was in full order for a long siege. It was surrendered by the older\r\nofficers, amidst the curses of the subalterns and the common soldiers: the\r\nartillerymen had to be dragged from their guns by force. Magdeburg, with a\r\ngarrison of 24,000 men and enormous supplies, fell before a French force\r\nnot numerous enough to beleaguer it (Nov. 8).\r\n\r\n[Napoleon's demands.]\r\n\r\nNeither Napoleon himself nor any one else in Europe could have foreseen\r\nsuch conduct on the part of the Prussian commanders. The unexpected series\r\nof capitulations made him demand totally different terms of peace from\r\nthose which he had offered after the battle of Jena. A week after the\r\nvictory, Napoleon had demanded, as the price of peace, the cession of\r\nPrussia's territory west of the Elbe, with the exception of the town of\r\nMagdeburg, and the withdrawal of Prussia from the affairs of Germany. These\r\nterms were communicated to King Frederick William; he accepted them, and\r\nsent Lucchesini to Berlin to negotiate for peace upon this basis.\r\nLucchesini had scarcely reached the capital when the tidings arrived of\r\nHohenlohe's capitulation, followed by the surrender of Stettin and Küstrin.\r\nThe Prussian envoy now sought in vain to procure Napoleon's ratification of\r\nthe terms which he had himself proposed. No word of peace could be\r\nobtained: an armistice was all that the Emperor would grant, and the terms\r\non which the armistice was offered rose with each new disaster to the\r\nPrussian arms. On the fall of Magdeburg becoming known, Napoleon demanded\r\nthat the troops of Prussia should retire behind the Vistula, and surrender\r\nevery fortress that they still retained, with the single exception of\r\nKönigsberg. Much as Prussia had lost, it would have cost Napoleon a second\r\ncampaign to make himself master of what he now asked; but to such a depth\r\nhad the Prussian Government sunk, that Lucchesini actually signed a\r\nconvention at Charlottenburg (November 16), surrendering to Napoleon, in\r\nreturn for an armistice, the entire list of uncaptured fortresses,\r\nincluding Dantzig and Thorn on the Lower Vistula, Breslau, with the rest of\r\nthe untouched defences of Silesia, Warsaw and Praga in Prussian Poland, and\r\nColberg upon the Pomeranian coast. [133]\r\n\r\n[Frederick William continues the war.]\r\n\r\nThe treaty, however, required the King's ratification. Frederick William,\r\ntimorous as he was, hesitated to confirm an agreement which ousted him from\r\nhis dominions as completely as if the last soldier of Prussia had gone into\r\ncaptivity. The patriotic party, headed by Stein, pleaded for the honour of\r\nthe country against the miserable Cabinet which now sought to complete its\r\nwork of ruin. Assurances of support arrived from St. Petersburg. The King\r\ndetermined to reject the treaty, and to continue the war to the last\r\nextremity. Haugwitz hereupon tendered his resignation, and terminated a\r\npolitical career disastrous beyond any recorded in modern times. For a\r\nmoment, it seemed as if the real interests of the country were at length to\r\nbe recognised in the appointment of Stein to one of the three principal\r\noffices of State. But the King still remained blind to the necessity of\r\nunity in the government, and angrily dismissed Stein when he refused to\r\nhold the Ministry if representatives of the old Cabinet and of the\r\npeace-party were to have places beside him. The King's act was ill\r\ncalculated to serve the interests of Prussia, either at home or abroad.\r\nStein was the one Minister on whom the patriotic party of Prussia and the\r\nGovernments of Europe could rely with perfect confidence. [134] His\r\ndismissal at this crisis proved the incurable poverty of Frederick\r\nWilliam's mental nature; it also proved that, so long as any hope remained\r\nof saving the Prussian State by the help of the Czar of Russia, the\r\npatriotic party had little chance of creating a responsible government at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon at Berlin.]\r\n\r\n[The Berlin decree against English commerce, Nov. 21, 1806.]\r\n\r\nThroughout the month of November French armies overran Northern Germany:\r\nNapoleon himself remained at Berlin, and laid the foundations of a\r\npolitical system corresponding to that which he had imposed upon Southern\r\nGermany after the victory of Austerlitz. The Houses of Brunswick and\r\nHesse-Cassel were deposed, in order to create a new client-kingdom of\r\nWestphalia; Saxony, with Weimar and four other duchies, entered the\r\nConfederation of the Rhine. A measure more widely affecting the Continent\r\nof Europe dated from the last days of the Emperor's residence at the\r\nPrussian capital. On the 21st of November, 1806, a decree was published at\r\nBerlin prohibiting the inhabitants of the entire European territory allied\r\nwith France from carrying on any commerce with Great Britain, or admitting\r\nany merchandise that had been produced in Great Britain or in its colonies.\r\n[135] The line of coast thus closed to the shipping and the produce of the\r\nBritish Empire included everything from the Vistula to the southern point\r\nof Dalmatia, with the exception of Denmark and Portugal and the Austrian\r\nport of Trieste. All property belonging to English subjects, all\r\nmerchandise of British origin, whoever might be the owner, was ordered to\r\nbe confiscated: no vessel that had even touched at a British port was\r\npermitted to enter a Continental harbour. It was the fixed purpose of\r\nNapoleon to exhaust Great Britain, since he could not destroy its navies,\r\nor, according to his own expression, to conquer England upon the Continent.\r\nAll that was most harsh and unjust in the operation of the Berlin Decree\r\nfell, however, more upon Napoleon's own subjects than upon Great Britain.\r\nThe exclusion of British ships from the harbours of the allies of France\r\nwas no more than the exercise of a common right in war; even the seizure of\r\nthe property of Englishmen, though a violation of international law, bore\r\nat least an analogy to the seizure of French property at sea; but the\r\nconfiscation of the merchandise of German and Dutch traders, after it had\r\nlain for weeks in their own warehouses, solely because it had been produced\r\nin the British Empire, was an act of flagrant and odious oppression. The\r\nfirst result of the Berlin Decree was to fill the trading towns of North\r\nGermany with French revenue-officers and inquisitors. Peaceable tradesmen\r\nbegan to understand the import of the battle of Jena when French gendarmes\r\nthrew their stock into the common furnace, or dragged them to prison for\r\npossessing a hogshead of Jamaica sugar or a bale of Leeds cloth. The\r\nmerchants who possessed a large quantity of English or colonial wares were\r\nthe heaviest sufferers by Napoleon's commercial policy: the public found\r\nthe markets supplied by American and Danish traders, until, at a later\r\nperiod, the British Government adopted reprisals, and prevented the ships\r\nof neutrals from entering any port from which English vessels were\r\nexcluded. Then every cottage felt the stress of the war. But if the full\r\nconsequences of the Berlin Decree were delayed until the retaliation of\r\nGreat Britain reached the dimensions of Napoleon's own tyranny, the Decree\r\nitself marked on the part of Napoleon the assumption of a power in conflict\r\nwith the needs and habits of European life. Like most of the schemes of\r\nNapoleon subsequent to the victories of 1806, it transgressed the limits of\r\npractical statesmanship, and displayed an ambition no longer raised above\r\nmere tyranny by its harmony with forms of progress and with the better\r\ntendencies of the age.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon and the Poles.]\r\n\r\nImmediately after signing the Berlin Decree, Napoleon quitted the Prussian\r\ncapital (Nov. 25). The first act of the war had now closed. The Prussian\r\nState was overthrown; its territory as far as the Vistula lay at the mercy\r\nof the invader; its King was a fugitive at Königsberg, at the eastern\r\nextremity of his dominions. The second act of the war began with the\r\nrejection of the armistice which had been signed by Lucchesini, and with\r\nthe entry of Russia into the field against Napoleon. The scene of\r\nhostilities was henceforward in Prussian Poland and in the Baltic Province\r\nlying between the lower Vistula and the Russian frontier. Napoleon entered\r\nPoland, as he had entered Italy ten years before, with the pretence of\r\nrestoring liberty to an enslaved people. Kosciusko's name was fraudulently\r\nattached to a proclamation summoning the Polish nation to arms; and\r\nalthough Kosciusko himself declined to place any trust in the betrayer of\r\nVenice, thousands of his countrymen flocked to Napoleon's standard, or\r\nanticipated his arrival by capturing and expelling the Prussian detachments\r\nscattered through their country. Promises of the restoration of Polish\r\nindependence were given by Napoleon in abundance; but the cause of Poland\r\nwas the last to attract the sympathy of a man who considered the sacrifice\r\nof the weak to the strong to be the first principle of all good policy. To\r\nhave attempted the restoration of Polish independence would have been to\r\nmake permanent enemies of Russia and Prussia for the sake of an ally weaker\r\nthan either of them. The project was not at this time seriously entertained\r\nby Napoleon. He had no motive to face a work of such enormous difficulty as\r\nthe creation of a solid political order among the most unpractical race in\r\nEurope. He was glad to enrol the Polish nobles among his soldiers; he knew\r\nthe value of their enthusiasm, and took pains to excite it; but, when the\r\nbattle was over, it was with Russia, not Poland, that France had to settle;\r\nand no better fate remained, even for the Prussian provinces of Poland,\r\nthan in part to be formed into a client-state, in part to be surrendered as\r\na means of accommodation with the Czar.\r\n\r\n[Campaign in Poland against Russia, Dec., 1806.]\r\n\r\nThe armies of Russia were at some distance from the Vistula when, in\r\nNovember, 1806, Napoleon entered Polish territory. Their movements were\r\nslow, their numbers insufficient. At the moment when all the forces of the\r\nEmpire were required for the struggle against Napoleon, troops were being\r\nsent into Moldavia against the Sultan. Nor were the Russian commanders\r\nanxious to save what still remained of the Prussian kingdom. The disasters\r\nof Prussia, like those of Austria at the beginning of the campaign of 1805,\r\nexcited less sympathy than contempt; and the inclination of the Czar's\r\ngenerals was rather to carry on the war upon the frontier of their own\r\ncountry than to commit themselves to a distant campaign with a despised\r\nally. Lestocq, who commanded the remnant of the Prussian army upon the\r\nVistula, was therefore directed to abandon his position at Thorn and to\r\nmove eastwards. The French crossed the Vistula higher up the river; and by\r\nthe middle of December the armies of France and Russia lay opposite to one\r\nanother in the neighbourhood of Pultusk, upon the Ukra and the Narew. The\r\nfirst encounter, though not of a decisive character, resulted in the\r\nretreat of the Russians. Heavy rains and fathomless mud checked the\r\npursuit. War seemed almost impossible in such a country and such a climate;\r\nand Napoleon ordered his troops to take up their winter quarters along the\r\nVistula, believing that nothing more could be attempted on either side\r\nbefore the spring.\r\n\r\n[Eylau, Feb. 8, 1807.]\r\n\r\n[Napoleon and Bennigsen in East Prussia.]\r\n\r\nBut the command of the Russian forces was now transferred from the aged and\r\nhalf-mad Kamenski, [136] who had opened the campaign, to a general better\r\nqualified to cope with Napoleon. Bennigsen, the new commander-in-chief, was\r\nan active and daring soldier. Though a German by birth, his soldiership was\r\nof that dogged and resolute order which suits the character of Russian\r\ntroops; and, in the mid-winter of 1806, Napoleon found beyond the Vistula\r\nsuch an enemy as he had never encountered in Western Europe. Bennigsen\r\nconceived the design of surprising the extreme left of the French line,\r\nwhere Ney's division lay stretched towards the Baltic, far to the\r\nnorth-east of Napoleon's main body. Forest and marsh concealed the movement\r\nof the Russian troops, and both Ney and Bernadotte narrowly escaped\r\ndestruction. Napoleon now broke up his winter quarters, and marched in\r\ngreat force against Bennigsen in the district between Königsberg and the\r\nmouth of the Vistula. Bennigsen manoeuvred and retired until his troops\r\nclamoured for battle. He then took up a position at Eylau, and waited for\r\nthe attack of the French. The battle of Eylau, fought in the midst of\r\nsnowstorms on the 8th of February, 1807, was unlike anything that Napoleon\r\nhad ever yet seen. His columns threw themselves in vain upon the Russian\r\ninfantry. Augereau's corps was totally destroyed in the beginning of the\r\nbattle. The Russians pressed upon the ground where Napoleon himself stood;\r\nand, although the superiority of the Emperor's tactics at length turned the\r\nscale, and the French began a forward movement, their advance was stopped\r\nby the arrival of Lestocq and a body of 13,000 Prussians. At the close of\r\nthe engagement 30,000 men lay wounded or dead in the snow; the positions of\r\nthe armies remained what they had been in the morning. Bennigsen's\r\nlieutenants urged him to renew the combat on the next day; but the\r\nconfusion of the Russian army was such that the French, in spite of their\r\nlosses and discouragement, would probably have gained the victory in a\r\nsecond battle; [137] and the Russian commander determined to fall back\r\ntowards Königsberg, content with having disabled the enemy and given\r\nNapoleon such a check as he had never received before. Napoleon, who had\r\nannounced his intention of entering Königsberg in triumph, fell back upon\r\nthe river Passarge, and awaited the arrival of reinforcements.\r\n\r\n[Sieges of Dantzig and Colberg, March, 1807.]\r\n\r\n[Inaction of England.]\r\n\r\n[Fall of Grenville's Ministry, March 24, 1807.]\r\n\r\n[Treaty of Bartenstein between Russia, Prussia, England, and Sweden.\r\nApril, 1807.]\r\n\r\nThe warfare of the next few months was confined to the reduction of the\r\nPrussian fortresses which had not yet fallen into the hands of the French.\r\nDantzig surrendered after a long and difficult siege; the little town of\r\nColberg upon the Pomeranian coast prolonged a defence as honourable to its\r\ninhabitants as to the military leaders. Two soldiers of singularly\r\ndifferent character, each destined to play a conspicuous part in coming\r\nyears, first distinguished themselves in the defence of Colberg. Gneisenau,\r\na scientific soldier of the highest order, the future guide of Blücher's\r\nvictorious campaigns, commanded the garrison; Schill, a cavalry officer of\r\nadventurous daring, gathered round him a troop of hardy riders, and\r\nharassed the French with an audacity as perplexing to his military\r\nsuperiors as to the enemy. The citizens, led by their burgomaster, threw\r\nthemselves into the work of defence with a vigour in striking contrast to\r\nthe general apathy of the Prussian people; and up to the end of the war\r\nColberg remained uncaptured. Obscure as Colberg was, its defence might have\r\ngiven a new turn to the war if the Government of Great Britain had listened\r\nto the entreaties of the Emperor Alexander, and despatched a force to the\r\nBaltic to threaten the communications of Napoleon. The task was not a\r\ndifficult one for a Power which could find troops, as England now did, to\r\nsend to Constantinople, to Alexandria, and to Buenos Ayres; but military\r\njudgment was more than ever wanting to the British Cabinet. Fox had died at\r\nthe beginning of the war; his successors in Grenville's Ministry, though\r\nthey possessed a sound theory of foreign policy, [138] were not fortunate\r\nin its application, nor were they prompt enough in giving financial help to\r\ntheir allies. Suddenly, however, King George quarrelled with his Ministers\r\nupon the ancient question of Catholic Disabilities, and drove them from\r\noffice (March 24). The country sided with the King. A Ministry came into\r\npower, composed of the old supporters of Pitt, men, with the exception of\r\nCanning and Castlereagh, of narrow views and poor capacity, headed by the\r\nDuke of Portland, who, in 1793, had given his name to the section of the\r\nWhig party which joined Pitt. The foreign policy of the new Cabinet, which\r\nconcealed its total lack of all other statesmanship, returned to the lines\r\nlaid down by Pitt in 1805. Negotiations were opened with Russia for the\r\ndespatch of an English army to the Baltic; arms and money were promised to\r\nthe Prussian King. For a moment it seemed as if the Powers of Europe had\r\nnever been united in so cordial a league. The Czar embraced the King of\r\nPrussia in the midst of his soldiers, and declared with tears that the two\r\nshould stand or fall together. The Treaty of Bartenstein, signed in April\r\n1807 pledged the Courts of St. Petersburg, Stockholm, and Berlin to a joint\r\nprosecution of the war, and the common conclusion of peace. Great Britain\r\njoined the pact, and prepared to fulfil its part in the conflict upon the\r\nBaltic. But the task was a difficult one, for Grenville's Ministry had\r\ndispersed the fleet of transports; and, although Canning determined upon\r\nthe Baltic expedition in April, two months passed before the fleet was\r\nready to sail.\r\n\r\n[Summer campaign in East Prussia, 1807.]\r\n\r\n[Battle of Friedland.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime army upon army was moving to the support of Napoleon, from\r\nFrance, from Spain, from Holland, and from Southern Germany. The fortresses\r\nof the Elbe and the Oder, which ought to have been his barrier, had become\r\nhis base of operations; and so enormous were the forces at his command,\r\nthat, after manning every stronghold in Central Europe, he was able at the\r\nbeginning of June to bring 140,000 men into the field beyond the Vistula.\r\nThe Russians had also received reinforcements, but Bennigsen's army was\r\nstill weaker than that of the enemy. It was Bennigsen, nevertheless, who\r\nbegan the attack; and now, as in the winter campaign, he attempted to\r\nsurprise and crush the northern corps of Ney. The same general movement of\r\nthe French army followed as in January. The Russian commander, outnumbered\r\nby the French, retired to his fortified camp at Heilsberg. After sustaining\r\na bloody repulse in an attack upon this position, Napoleon drew Bennigsen\r\nfrom his lair by marching straight upon Königsberg. Bennigsen supposed\r\nhimself to be in time to deal with an isolated corps; he found himself face\r\nto face with the whole forces of the enemy at Friedland, accepted battle,\r\nand was unable to save his army from a severe and decisive defeat (June\r\n14). The victory of Friedland brought the French into Königsberg. Bennigsen\r\nretired behind the Niemen; and on the 19th of June an armistice closed the\r\noperations of the hostile forces upon the frontiers of Russia. [139]\r\n\r\nThe situation of Bennigsen's army was by no means desperate. His men had\r\nnot been surrounded; they had lost scarcely any prisoners; they felt no\r\nfear of the French. But the general exaggerated the seriousness of his\r\ndefeat. Like most of his officers, he was weary of the war, and felt no\r\nsympathy with the motives which led the Emperor to fight for the common\r\ncause of Europe. The politicians who surrounded Alexander urged him to\r\nwithdraw Russia from a conflict in which she had nothing to gain. The\r\nEmperor wavered. The tardiness of Great Britain, the continued neutrality\r\nof Austria, cast a doubt upon the wisdom of his own disinterestedness; and\r\nhe determined to meet Napoleon, and ascertain the terms on which Russia\r\nmight be reconciled to the master of half the Continent.\r\n\r\n[Interview of Napoleon and Alexander at Tilsit, June 25.]\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of June the two sovereigns met one another on the raft of\r\nTilsit, in the midstream of the river Niemen. The conversation, which is\r\nalleged to have been opened by Alexander with an expression of hatred\r\ntowards England, was heard by no one but the speakers. But whatever the\r\neagerness or the reluctance of the Russian monarch to sever himself from\r\nGreat Britain, the purpose of Napoleon was effected. Alexander surrendered\r\nhimself to the addresses of a conqueror who seemed to ask for nothing and\r\nto offer everything. The negotiations were prolonged; the relations of the\r\ntwo monarchs became more and more intimate; and the issue of the struggle\r\nfor life or death was that Russia accepted the whole scheme of Napoleonic\r\nconquest, and took its place by the side of the despoiler in return for its\r\nshare of the prey. It was in vain that the King of Prussia had rejected\r\nNapoleon's offers after the battle of Eylau, in fidelity to his engagements\r\ntowards his ally. Promises, treaties, and pity were alike cast to the\r\nwinds. The unfortunate Frederick William received no more embraces; the\r\nfriend with whom he was to stand or fall bargained away the larger half of\r\nhis dominions to Napoleon, and even rectified the Russian frontier at his\r\nexpense. Prussia's continued existence in any shape whatever was described\r\nas a concession made by Napoleon to Alexander. By the public articles of\r\nthe Treaties of Tilsit, signed by France, Russia, and Prussia in the first\r\nweek of July, the King of Prussia ceded to Napoleon the whole of his\r\ndominions west of the Elbe, and the entire territory which Prussia had\r\ngained in the three partitions of Poland, with the exception of a district\r\nupon the Lower Vistula connecting Pomerania with Eastern Prussia. Out of\r\nthe ceded territory on the west of the Elbe a Kingdom of Westphalia was\r\ncreated for Napoleon's brother Jerome; the Polish provinces of Prussia,\r\nwith the exception of a strip made over to Alexander, were formed into the\r\nGrand-Duchy of Warsaw, and presented to Napoleon's vassal, the King of\r\nSaxony. Russia recognised the Napoleonic client-states in Italy, Holland,\r\nand Germany. The Czar undertook to offer his mediation in the conflict\r\nbetween France and Great Britain; a secret article provided that, in the\r\nevent of Great Britain and France being at war on the ensuing 1st of\r\nDecember, Prussia should declare war against Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Secret Treaty of Alliance.]\r\n\r\n[Conspiracy of the two Emperors.]\r\n\r\nSuch were the stipulations contained in the formal Treaties of Peace\r\nbetween the three Powers. These, however, contained but a small part of the\r\nterms agreed upon between the masters of the east and of the west.\r\nA secret Treaty of Alliance, distinct from the Treaty of Peace, was also\r\nsigned by Napoleon and Alexander. In the conversations which won over the\r\nCzar to the cause of France, Napoleon had offered to Alexander the spoils\r\nof Sweden and the Ottoman Empire. Finland and the Danubian provinces were\r\nnot too high a price for the support of a Power whose arms could paralyse\r\nAustria and Prussia. In return for the promise of this extension of his\r\nEmpire, Alexander undertook, in the event of Great Britain refusing terms\r\nof peace dictated by himself, to unite his arms to those of Napoleon, and\r\nto force the neutral maritime Powers, Denmark and Portugal, to take part in\r\nthe struggle against England. The annexation of Moldavia and Wallachia to\r\nthe Russian Empire was provided for under the form of a French mediation.\r\nIn the event of the Porte declining this mediation, Napoleon undertook to\r\nassist Russia to liberate all the European territory subject to the yoke of\r\nthe Sultan, with the exception of Roumelia and Constantinople. A partition\r\nof the liberated territory between France and Russia, as well as the\r\nestablishment of the Napoleonic house in Spain, probably formed the subject\r\nrather of a verbal understanding than of any written agreement. [140]\r\n\r\nSuch was this vast and threatening scheme, conceived by the man whose whole\r\ncareer had been one consistent struggle for personal domination, accepted\r\nby the man who among the rulers of the Continent had hitherto shown the\r\ngreatest power of acting for a European end, and of interesting himself in\r\na cause not directly his own. In the imagination of Napoleon, the national\r\nforces of the western continent had now ceased to exist. Austria excepted,\r\nthere was no State upon the mainland whose army and navy were not\r\nprospectively in the hands of himself and his new ally. The commerce of\r\nGreat Britain, already excluded from the greater part of Europe, was now to\r\nbe shut out from all the rest; the armies which had hitherto fought under\r\nBritish subsidies for the independence of Europe, the navies which had\r\npreserved their existence by neutrality or by friendship with England, were\r\nsoon to be thrown without distinction against that last foe. If even at\r\nthis moment an English statesman who had learnt the secret agreement of\r\nTilsit might have looked without fear to the future of his country, it was\r\nnot from any imperfection in the structure of Continental tyranny. The\r\nfleets of Denmark and Portugal might be of little real avail against\r\nEnglish seamen; the homes of the English people might still be as secure\r\nfrom foreign invasion as when Nelson guarded the seas; but it was not from\r\nany vestige of political honour surviving in the Emperor Alexander. Where\r\nAlexander's action was of decisive importance, in his mediation between\r\nFrance and Prussia, he threw himself without scruple on to the side of\r\noppression. It lay within his power to gain terms of peace for Prussia as\r\nlenient as those which Austria had gained at Campo Formio and at Lunéville:\r\nhe sacrificed Prussia, as he allied himself against the last upholders of\r\nnational independence in Europe, in order that he might himself receive\r\nFinland and the Danubian Provinces.\r\n\r\n[English expedition against Denmark, July, 1807.]\r\n\r\nTwo days before the signature of the Treaty of Tilsit the British troops\r\nwhich had once been so anxiously expected by the Czar landed in the island\r\nof Rügen. The struggle in which they were intended to take their part was\r\nover. Sweden alone remained in arms; and even the Quixotic pugnacity of\r\nKing Gustavus was unable to save Stralsund from a speedy capitulation. But\r\nthe troops of Great Britain were not destined to return without striking a\r\nblow. The negotiations between Napoleon and Alexander had scarcely begun,\r\nwhen secret intelligence of their purport was sent to the British\r\nGovernment. [141] It became known in London that the fleet of Denmark was\r\nto be seized by Napoleon, and forced to fight against Great Britain.\r\nCanning and his colleagues acted with the promptitude that seldom failed\r\nthe British Government when it could effect its object by the fleet alone.\r\nThey determined to anticipate Napoleon's violation of Danish neutrality,\r\nand to seize upon the navy which would otherwise be seized by France and\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\n[Bombardment of Copenhagen, Sept. 2.]\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of July a fleet with 20,000 men on board set sail from the\r\nBritish coast. The troops landed in Denmark in the middle of August, and\r\nunited with the corps which had already been despatched to Rügen. The\r\nDanish Government was summoned to place its navy in the hands of Great\r\nBritain, in order that it might remain as a deposit in some British port\r\nuntil the conclusion of peace. While demanding this sacrifice of Danish\r\nneutrality, England undertook to protect the Danish nation and colonies\r\nfrom the hostility of Napoleon, and to place at the disposal of its\r\nGovernment every means of naval and military defence. Failing the surrender\r\nof the fleet, the English declared that they would bombard Copenhagen. The\r\nreply given to this summons was such as might be expected from a courageous\r\nnation exasperated against Great Britain by its harsh treatment of neutral\r\nships of commerce, and inclined to submit to the despot of the Continent\r\nrather than to the tyrants of the seas. Negotiations proved fruitless, and\r\non the 2nd of September the English opened fire on Copenhagen. For three\r\ndays and nights the city underwent a bombardment of cruel efficiency.\r\nEighteen hundred houses were levelled, the town was set on fire in several\r\nplaces, and a large number of the inhabitants lost their lives. At length\r\nthe commander found himself compelled to capitulate. The fleet was handed\r\nover to Great Britain, with all the stores in the arsenal of Copenhagen. It\r\nwas brought to England, no longer under the terms of a friendly neutrality,\r\nbut as a prize of war.\r\n\r\nThe captors themselves were ashamed of their spoil. England received an\r\narmament which had been taken from a people who were not our enemies, and\r\nby an attack which was not war, with more misgiving than applause. In\r\nEurope the seemingly unprovoked assault upon a weak neutral State excited\r\nthe utmost indignation. The British Ministry, who were prevented from\r\nmaking public the evidence which they had received of the intention of the\r\ntwo Emperors, were believed to have invented the story of the Secret\r\nTreaty. The Danish Government denied that Napoleon had demanded their\r\nco-operation; Napoleon and Alexander themselves assumed the air of\r\nindignant astonishment. But the facts alleged by Canning and his colleagues\r\nwere correct. The conspiracy of the two Emperors was no fiction. The only\r\nquestion still remaining open--and this is indeed an essential one--relates\r\nto the engagements entered into by the Danish Government itself. Napoleon\r\nin his correspondence of this date alludes to certain promises made to him\r\nby the Court of Denmark, but he also complains that these promises had not\r\nbeen fulfilled; and the context of the letter renders it almost certain\r\nthat, whatever may have been demanded by Napoleon, nothing more was\r\npromised by Denmark than that its ports should be closed to English\r\nvessels. [142] Had the British Cabinet possessed evidence of the\r\ndetermination of the Danish Government to transfer its fleet to Napoleon\r\nwithout resistance, the attack upon Denmark, considered as virtually an act\r\nof war, would not have been unjust. But beyond an alleged expression of\r\nNapoleon at Tilsit, no such evidence was even stated to have reached\r\nLondon; and the undoubted conspiracy of the Emperors against Danish\r\nneutrality was no sufficient ground for an action on the part of Great\r\nBritain which went so far beyond the mere frustration of their designs. The\r\nsurrender of the Danish fleet demanded by England would have been an\r\nunqualified act of war on the part of Denmark against Napoleon; it was no\r\nmere guarantee for a continued neutrality. Nor had the British Government\r\nthe last excuse of an urgent and overwhelming necessity. Nineteen Danish\r\nmen-of-war would not have turned the scale against England. The memory of\r\nTrafalgar might well have given a British Ministry courage to meet its\r\nenemies by the ordinary methods of war. Had the forces of Denmark been far\r\nlarger than they actually were, the peril of Great Britain was not so\r\nextreme as to excuse the wrong done to mankind by an example encouraging\r\nall future belligerents to anticipate one another in forcing each neutral\r\nstate to take part with themselves.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon's demands upon Portugal.]\r\n\r\nThe fleet which Napoleon had meant to turn against this country now lay\r\nsafe within Portsmouth harbour. Denmark, in bitter resentment, declared war\r\nagainst Great Britain, and rendered some service to the Continental League\r\nby the attacks of its privateers upon British merchant-vessels in the\r\nBaltic. The second neutral Power whose fate had been decided by the two\r\nEmperors at Tilsit received the summons of Napoleon a few days before the\r\nattack on Copenhagen. The Regent of Portugal himself informed the British\r\nGovernment that he had been required by Napoleon to close his ports to\r\nBritish vessels, to declare war on England, and to confiscate all British\r\nproperty within his dominions. Placed between a Power which could strip him\r\nof his dominions on land, and one which could despoil him of everything he\r\npossessed beyond the sea, the Regent determined to maintain his ancient\r\nfriendship with Great Britain, and to submit to Napoleon only in so far as\r\nthe English Government would excuse him, as acting under coercion. Although\r\na nominal state of war arose between Portugal and England, the Regent\r\nreally acted in the interest of England, and followed the advice of the\r\nBritish Cabinet up to the end.\r\n\r\n[Treaty of Fontainebleau between France and Spain for the partition of\r\nPortugal, Oct. 27.]\r\n\r\nThe end was soon to come. The demands of Napoleon, arbitrary and oppressive\r\nas they were, by no means expressed his full intentions towards Portugal.\r\nHe had determined to seize upon this country, and to employ it as a means\r\nfor extending his own dominion over the whole of the Spanish Peninsula. An\r\narmy-corps, under the command of Junot, had been already placed in the\r\nPyrenees. On the 12th of October Napoleon received the answer of the Regent\r\nof Portugal, consenting to declare war upon England, and only rejecting the\r\ndishonourable order to confiscate all English property. This single act of\r\nresistance was sufficient for Napoleon's purpose. He immediately recalled\r\nhis ambassador from Lisbon, and gave orders to Junot to cross the frontier,\r\nand march upon Portugal. The King of Spain, who was to be Napoleon's next\r\nvictim, was for the moment employed as his accomplice. A treaty was\r\nconcluded at Fontainebleau between Napoleon and King Charles IV. for the\r\npartition of Portugal (Oct. 27). [143] In return for the cession of the\r\nkingdom of Etruria, which was still nominally governed by a member of the\r\nSpanish house, the King of Spain was promised half the Portuguese colonies,\r\nalong with the title of Emperor of the Indies; the northern provinces of\r\nPortugal were reserved for the infant King of Etruria, its southern\r\nprovinces for Godoy, Minister of Charles IV.; the central districts were to\r\nremain in the hands of France, and to be employed as a means of regaining\r\nthe Spanish colonies from England upon the conclusion of a general peace.\r\n\r\n[Junot invades Portugal, Nov., 1807.]\r\n\r\n[Flight of the House of Braganza.]\r\n\r\nNot one of these provisions was intended to be carried into effect. The\r\nconquest of Portugal was but a part of the conquest of the whole peninsula.\r\nBut neither the Spanish Court nor the Spanish people suspected Napoleon's\r\ndesign. Junot advanced without resistance through the intervening Spanish\r\nterritory, and pushed forward upon Lisbon with the utmost haste. The speed\r\nat which Napoleon's orders forced him to march reduced his army to utter\r\nprostration, and the least resistance would have resulted in its ruin. But\r\nthe Court of Lisbon had determined to quit a country which they could not\r\nhope to defend against the master of the Continent. Already in the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries the House of Braganza had been\r\nfamiliar with the project of transferring the seat of their Government to\r\nBrazil; and now, with the approval of Great Britain, the Regent resolved to\r\nmaintain the independence of his family by flight across the Atlantic. As\r\nJunot's troops approached the capital, the servants of the palace hastily\r\nstowed the royal property on ship-board. On the 29th of November, when the\r\nFrench were now close at hand, the squadron which bore the House of\r\nBraganza to its colonial home dropped down the Tagus, saluted by the cannon\r\nof the English fleet that lay in the same river. Junot entered the capital\r\na few hours later, and placed himself at the head of the Government without\r\nencountering any opposition. The occupation of Portugal was described by\r\nNapoleon as a reprisal for the bombardment of Copenhagen. It excited but\r\nlittle attention in Europe; and even at the Spanish Court the only feeling\r\nwas one of satisfaction at the approaching aggrandisement of the Bourbon\r\nmonarchy. The full significance of Napoleon's intervention in the affairs\r\nof the Peninsula was not discovered until some months were passed.\r\n\r\n[Prussia after the Peace of Tilsit.]\r\n\r\n[Stein Minister, Oct. 5, 1807.]\r\n\r\nPortugal and Denmark had felt the consequences of the peace made at Tilsit.\r\nLess, however, depended upon the fate of the Danish fleet and the\r\nPortuguese Royal Family than upon the fate of Prussia, the most cruelly\r\nwronged of all the victims sacrificed by Alexander's ambition. The\r\nunfortunate Prussian State, reduced to half its former extent, devastated\r\nand impoverished by war, and burdened with the support of a French army,\r\nfound in the crisis of its ruin the beginning of a worthier national life.\r\nNapoleon, in his own vindictive jealousy, unwittingly brought to the head\r\nof the Prussian Government the ablest and most patriotic statesman of the\r\nContinent. Since the spring of 1807 Baron Hardenberg had again been the\r\nleading Minister of Prussia, and it was to his counsel that the King's\r\nhonourable rejection of a separate peace after the battle of Eylau was due.\r\nNapoleon could not permit this Minister, whom he had already branded as a\r\npartisan of Great Britain, to remain in power; he insisted upon\r\nHardenberg's dismissal, and recommended the King of Prussia to summon\r\nStein, who was as yet known to Napoleon only as a skilful financier, likely\r\nto succeed in raising the money which the French intended to extort.\r\n\r\n[Edict of Emancipation, Oct. 9, 1807.]\r\n\r\nStein entered upon office on the 5th of October, 1807, with almost\r\ndictatorial power. The need of the most radical changes in the public\r\nservices, as well as in the social order of the Prussian State, had been\r\nbrought home to all enlightened men by the disasters of the war; and a\r\ncommission, which included among its members the historian Niebuhr, had\r\nalready sketched large measures of reform before Hardenberg quitted office.\r\nStein's appointment brought to the head of the State a man immeasurably\r\nsuperior to Hardenberg in the energy necessary for the execution of great\r\nchanges, and gave to those who were the most sincerely engaged in civil or\r\nmilitary reform a leader unrivalled in patriotic zeal, in boldness, and in\r\npurity of character. The first great legislative measure of Stein was the\r\nabolition of serfage, and of all the legal distinctions which fixed within\r\nthe limits of their caste the noble, the citizen, and the peasant. In\r\nsetting his name to the edict [144] which, on the 9th of October, 1807,\r\nmade an end of the mediæval framework of Prussian society, Stein was indeed\r\nbut consummating a change which the progress of neighbouring States must\r\nhave forced upon Prussia, whoever held its government. The Decree was\r\nframed upon the report of Hardenberg's Commission, and was published by\r\nStein within six days after his own entry upon office. Great as were the\r\nchanges involved in this edict of emancipation, it contained no more than\r\nwas necessary to bring Prussia up to the level of the least advanced of the\r\nwestern Continental States. In Austria pure serfage had been abolished by\r\nMaria Theresa thirty years before; it vanished, along with most of the\r\nlegal distinctions of class, wherever the victories of France carried a new\r\npolitical order; even the misused peasantry of Poland had been freed from\r\ntheir degrading yoke within the borders of the newly-founded Duchy of\r\nWarsaw. If Prussia was not to renounce its partnership in European progress\r\nand range itself with its barbarous eastern neighbour, that order which\r\nfettered the peasant to the soil, and limited every Prussian to the\r\nhereditary occupations of his class could no longer be maintained. It is\r\nnot as an achievement of individual genius, but as the most vivid\r\nexpression of the differences between the old and the new Europe, that the\r\nfirst measure of Stein deserves a closer examination.\r\n\r\n[The Prussian peasant before and after the Edict of Oct. 9.]\r\n\r\nThe Edict of October 9, 1807, extinguished all personal servitude; it\r\npermitted the noble, the citizen, and the peasant to follow any calling; it\r\nabolished the rule which prevented land held by a member of one class from\r\npassing into the hands of another class; it empowered families to free\r\ntheir estates from entail. Taken together, these enactments substitute the\r\nfree disposition of labour and property for the outworn doctrine which\r\nPrussia had inherited from the feudal ages, that what a man is born that he\r\nshall live and die. The extinction of serfage, though not the most\r\nprominent provision of the Edict, was the one whose effects were the\r\nsoonest felt. In the greater part of Prussia the marks of serfage, as\r\ndistinct from payments and services amounting to a kind of rent, were the\r\nobligation of the peasant to remain on his holding, and the right of the\r\nlord to take the peasant's children as unpaid servants into his house. A\r\ngeneral relation of obedience and command existed, as between an hereditary\r\nsubject and master, although the lord could neither exact an arbitrary\r\namount of labour nor inflict the cruel punishments which had been common in\r\nPoland and Hungary. What the villein was in England in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, that the serf was in Prussia in the year 1806; and the change\r\nwhich in England gradually elevated the villein into the free copyholder\r\nwas that change which, so many centuries later, the Prussian legislator\r\neffected by one great measure. Stein made the Prussian peasant what the\r\nEnglish copyholder had become at the accession of Henry VII., and what the\r\nFrench peasant had been before 1789, a free person, but one bound to render\r\nfixed dues and service to the lord of the manor in virtue of the occupation\r\nof his land. These feudal dues and services, which the French peasant,\r\naccustomed for centuries before the Revolution to consider himself as the\r\nfull proprietor of the land, treated as a mere grievance and abuse, Stein\r\nconsidered to be the best form in which the joint interest of the lord and\r\nthe peasant could be maintained. It was reserved for Hardenberg, four years\r\nlater, to free the peasant from all obligations towards his lord, and to\r\nplace him in unshackled proprietorship of two-thirds of his former holding,\r\nthe lord receiving the remaining one-third in compensation for the loss of\r\nfeudal dues. Neither Stein nor Hardenberg interfered with the right of the\r\nlord to act as judge and police-magistrate within the limits of his manor;\r\nand the hereditary legal jurisdiction, which was abolished in Scotland in\r\n1747, and in France in 1789, continued unchanged in Prussia down to the\r\nyear 1848.\r\n\r\n[Relative position of the peasant in Prussia and England.]\r\n\r\nThe history of Agrarian Reform upon the Continent shows how vast was the\r\ninterval of time by which some of the greatest social changes in England\r\nhad anticipated the corresponding changes in almost all other nations. But\r\nif the Prussian peasant at the beginning of this century remained in the\r\nservile condition which had passed out of mind in Great Britain before the\r\nReformation, the early prosperity of the peasant in England was dearly\r\npurchased by a subsequent decline which has made his present lot far\r\ninferior to that of the children or grandchildren of the Prussian serf.\r\nHowever heavy the load of the Prussian serf, his holding was at least\r\nprotected by law from absorption into the domain of his lord. Before\r\nsufficient capital had been amassed in Prussia to render landed property an\r\nobject of competition, the forced military service of Frederick had made it\r\na rule of State that the farmsteads of the peasant class must remain\r\nundiminished in number, at whatever violence to the laws of the market or\r\nthe desires of great landlords. No process was permitted to take place\r\ncorresponding to that by which in England, after the villein had become the\r\nfree copyholder, the lord, with or without technical legal right,\r\nterminated the copyhold tenure of his retainer, and made the land as much\r\nhis own exclusive property as the chairs and tables in his house. In\r\nPrussia, if the law kept the peasant on the land, it also kept the land for\r\nthe peasant. Economic conditions, in the absence of such control in\r\nEngland, worked against the class of small holders. Their early\r\nenfranchisement in fact contributed to their extinction. It would perhaps\r\nhave been better for the English labouring class to remain bound by a\r\nsemi-servile tie to their land, than to gain a free holding which the law,\r\nsiding with the landlord, treated as terminable at the expiration of\r\nparticular lives, and which the increasing capital of the rich made its\r\nfavourite prey. It is little profit to the landless, resourceless English\r\nlabourer to know that his ancestor was a yeoman when the Prussian was a\r\nserf. Long as the bondage of the peasant on the mainland endured,\r\nprosperity came at last. The conditions which once distinguished\r\nagricultural England from the Continent are now reversed. Nowhere on the\r\nContinent is there a labouring class so stripped and despoiled of all\r\ninterest in the soil, so sedulously excluded from all possibilities of\r\nproprietorship, as in England. In England alone the absence of internal\r\nrevolution and foreign pressure has preserved a class whom a life spent in\r\ntoil leaves as bare and dependent as when it began, and to whom the only\r\nboon which their country can offer is the education which may lead them to\r\nquit it.\r\n\r\n[Reform of Prussian Army.]\r\n\r\n[Short service.]\r\n\r\nBesides the commission which had drafted the Edict of Emancipation, Stein\r\nfound a military commission engaged on a plan for the reorganisation of the\r\nPrussian army. The existing system forced the peasant to serve in the ranks\r\nfor twenty years, and drew the officers from the nobility, leaving the\r\ninhabitants of towns without either the duty or the right to enter the army\r\nat all. Since the battle of Jena, no one doubted that the principle of\r\nuniversal liability to military service must be introduced into Prussia; on\r\nthe other hand, the very disasters of the State rendered it impossible to\r\nmaintain an army on anything approaching to its former scale. With half its\r\nterritory torn from it, and the remainder devastated by war, Prussia could\r\nbarely afford to keep 40,000 soldiers in arms. Such were the conditions\r\nlaid before the men who were charged with the construction of a new\r\nPrussian military system. Their conclusions, imperfect in themselves, and\r\nbut partially carried out in the succeeding years, have nevertheless been\r\nthe basis of the latest military organisation of Prussia and of Europe\r\ngenerally. The problem was solved by the adoption of a short period of\r\nservice and the rapid drafting of the trained conscript into a\r\nreserve-force. Scharnhorst, President of the Military Commission, to whom\r\nmore than to any one man Prussia owed its military revival, proposed to\r\nmaintain an Active Army of 40,000 men; a Reserve, into which soldiers\r\nshould pass after short service in the active army; a Landwehr, to be\r\nemployed only for the internal defence of the country; and a Landsturm, or\r\ngeneral arming of the population, for a species of guerilla warfare.\r\nScharnhorst's project was warmly supported by Stein, who held a seat and a\r\nvote on the Military Commission; and the system of short service, with a\r\nReserve, was immediately brought into action, though on a very limited\r\nscale. The remainder of the scheme had to wait for the assistance of\r\nevents. The principle of universal military obligation was first proclaimed\r\nin the war of 1813, when also the Landwehr was first enrolled.\r\n\r\n[Stein's plans of political reform.]\r\n\r\n[Design for a Parliament, for Municipalities, and District boards.]\r\n\r\nThe reorganisation of the Prussian military system and the emancipation of\r\nthe peasant, though promoted by Stein's accession to power, did not\r\noriginate in Stein himself; the distinctive work of Stein was a great\r\nscheme of political reform. Had Stein remained longer in power, he would\r\nhave given to Prussia at least the beginnings of constitutional government.\r\nEvents drove him from office when but a small part of his project was\r\ncarried into effect; but the project itself was great and comprehensive. He\r\ndesigned to give Prussia a Parliament, and to establish a system of\r\nself-government in its towns and country districts. Stein had visited\r\nEngland in his youth. The history and the literature of England interested\r\nhim beyond those of any other country; and he had learnt from England that\r\nthe partnership of the nation in the work of government, so far from\r\nweakening authority, animates it with a force which no despotic system can\r\nlong preserve. Almost every important State-paper written by Stein\r\ndenounces the apathy of the civil population of Prussia, and attributes it\r\nto their exclusion from all exercise of public duties. He declared that the\r\nnation must be raised from its torpor by the establishment of\r\nrepresentative government and the creation of free local institutions in\r\ntown and country. Stein was no friend of democracy. Like every other\r\nPrussian statesman he took for granted the exercise of a vigorous\r\nmonarchical power at the centre of the State; but around the permanent\r\nexecutive he desired to gather the Council of the Nation, checking at least\r\nthe caprices of Cabinet-rule, and making the opinion of the people felt by\r\nthe monarch. Stein's Parliament would have been a far weaker body than the\r\nEnglish House of Commons, but it was at least not intended to be a mockery,\r\nlike those legislative bodies which Napoleon and his clients erected as the\r\ndisguise of despotism. The transaction of local business in the towns and\r\ncountry districts, which had hitherto belonged to officials of the Crown,\r\nStein desired to transfer in part to bodies elected by the inhabitants\r\nthemselves. The functions allotted to the new municipal bodies illustrated\r\nthe modest and cautious nature of Stein's attempt in the direction of\r\nself-government, including no more than the care of the poor, the\r\nsuperintendence of schools, and the maintenance of streets and public\r\nbuildings. Finance remained partly, police wholly, in the hands of the\r\ncentral Government. Equally limited were the powers which Stein proposed to\r\nentrust to the district councils elected by the rural population. In\r\ncomparison with the self-government of England or America, the\r\nself-government which Stein would have introduced into Prussia was of the\r\nmost elementary character; yet his policy stood out in striking contrast to\r\nthat which in every client-state of Napoleon was now crushing out the last\r\nelements of local independence under a rigid official centralisation.\r\n\r\n[Municipal reform alone carried out.]\r\n\r\nStein was indeed unable to transform Prussia as he desired. Of the\r\nlegislative, the municipal, and the district reforms which he had sketched,\r\nthe municipal reform was the only one which he had time to carry out before\r\nbeing driven from power; and for forty years the municipal institutions\r\ncreated by Stein were the only fragment of liberty which Prussia enjoyed. A\r\nvehement opposition to reform was excited among the landowners, and\r\nsupported by a powerful party at the Court. Stein was detested by the\r\nnobles whose peasants he had emancipated, and by the Berlin aristocracy,\r\nwhich for the last ten years had maintained the policy of friendship with\r\nFrance, and now declared the only safety of the Prussian State to lie in\r\nunconditional submission to Napoleon. The fire of patriotism, of energy, of\r\nself-sacrifice, which burned in Stein made him no representative of the\r\nPrussian governing classes of his time. It was not long before the\r\nlandowners, who deemed him a Jacobin, and the friends of the French, who\r\ncalled him a madman, had the satisfaction of seeing the Minister sent into\r\nbanishment by order of Napoleon himself (Dec., 1808). Stein left the\r\ngreater part of his work uncompleted, but he had not laboured in vain. The\r\nyears of his ministry in 1807 and 1808 were the years that gathered\r\ntogether everything that was worthiest in Prussia in the dawn of a national\r\nrevival, and prepared the way for that great movement in which, after an\r\ninterval of the deepest gloom, Stein was himself to light the nation to its\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpain in 1806--Napoleon uses the quarrel between Ferdinand and Godoy--He\r\naffects to be Ferdinand's protector--Dupont's army enters Spain--Murat in\r\nSpain--Charles abdicates--Ferdinand King--Savary brings Ferdinand to\r\nBayonne--Napoleon makes both Charles and Ferdinand resign--Spirit of the\r\nSpanish Nation--Contrast with Germany--Rising of all Spain--The Notables at\r\nBayonne--Campaign of 1808--Capitulation of Baylen--Wellesley lands in\r\nPortugal--Vimieiro--Convention of Cintra--Effect of the Spanish Rising on\r\nEurope--War Party in Prussia--Napoleon and Alexander at Erfurt--Stein\r\nresigns, and is proscribed--Napoleon in Spain--Spanish Misgovernment--\r\nCampaign on the Ebro--Campaign of Sir John Moore--Corunna--Napoleon\r\nleaves Spain--Siege of Saragossa--Successes of the French.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Spanish affairs, 1793-1806.]\r\n\r\n[Spain in 1806.]\r\n\r\nSpain, which had played so insignificant a part throughout the\r\nRevolutionary War, was now about to become the theatre of events that\r\nopened a new world of hope to Europe. Its King, the Bourbon Charles IV.,\r\nwas more weak and more pitiful than any sovereign of the age. Power\r\nbelonged to the Queen and to her paramour Godoy, who for the last fourteen\r\nyears had so conducted the affairs of the country that every change in its\r\npolicy had brought with it new disaster. In the war of the First Coalition\r\nSpain had joined the Allies, and French armies had crossed the Pyrenees. In\r\n1796 Spain entered the service of France, and lost the battle of St.\r\nVincent. At the Peace of Amiens, Napoleon surrendered its colony Trinidad\r\nto England; on the renewal of the war he again forced it into hostilities\r\nwith Great Britain, and brought upon it the disaster of Trafalgar. This\r\nunbroken humiliation of the Spanish arms, combined with intolerable\r\noppression and impoverishment at home, raised so bitter an outcry against\r\nGodoy's government, that foreign observers, who underrated the loyalty of\r\nthe Spanish people, believed the country to be on the verge of revolution.\r\nAt the Court itself the Crown Prince Ferdinand, under the influence of his\r\nNeapolitan wife, headed a party in opposition to Godoy and the supporters\r\nof French dominion. Godoy, insecure at home, threw himself the more\r\nunreservedly into the arms of Napoleon, who bestowed upon him a\r\ncontemptuous patronage, and flattered him with the promise of an\r\nindependent principality in Portugal. Izquierdo, Godoy's agent at Paris,\r\nreceived proposals from Napoleon which were concealed from the Spanish\r\nAmbassador; and during the first months of 1806 Napoleon possessed no more\r\ndevoted servant than the man who virtually held the government of Spain.\r\n\r\n[Spain intends to join Prussia in 1806.]\r\n\r\nThe opening of negotiations between Napoleon and Fox's Ministry in May,\r\n1806, first shook this relation of confidence and obedience. Peace between\r\nFrance and England involved the abandonment on the part of Napoleon of any\r\nattack upon Portugal; and Napoleon now began to meet Godoy's inquiries\r\nafter his Portuguese principality with an ominous silence. The next\r\nintelligence received was that the Spanish Balearic Islands had been\r\noffered by Napoleon to Great Britain, with the view of providing an\r\nindemnity for Ferdinand of Naples, if he should give up Sicily to Joseph\r\nBonaparte (July, 1806.) This contemptuous appropriation of Spanish\r\nterritory, without even the pretence of consulting the Spanish Government,\r\nexcited scarcely less anger at Madrid than the corresponding proposal with\r\nregard to Hanover excited at Berlin. The Court began to meditate a change\r\nof policy, and watched the events which were leading Prussia to arm for the\r\nwar of 1806. A few weeks more passed, and news arrived that Buenos Ayres,\r\nthe capital of Spanish South America, had fallen into the hands of the\r\nEnglish. This disaster produced the deepest impression, for the loss of\r\nBuenos Ayres was believed, and with good reason, to be but the prelude to\r\nthe loss of the entire American empire of Spain. Continuance of the war\r\nwith England was certain ruin; alliance with the enemies of Napoleon was at\r\nleast not hopeless, now that Prussia was on the point of throwing its army\r\ninto the scale against France. An agent was despatched by the Spanish\r\nGovernment to London (Sept., 1806); and, upon the commencement of\r\nhostilities by Prussia, a proclamation was issued by Godoy, which, without\r\nnaming any actual enemy, summoned the Spanish people to prepare for a war\r\non behalf of their country.\r\n\r\n[Treaty of Fontainebleau, Oct., 1807.]\r\n\r\nScarcely had the manifesto been read by the Spaniards when the Prussian\r\narmy was annihilated at Jena. The dream of resistance to Napoleon vanished\r\naway; the only anxiety of the Spanish Government was to escape from the\r\nconsequences of its untimely daring. Godoy hastened to explain that his\r\nmartial proclamation had been directed not against the Emperor of the\r\nFrench, but against the Emperor of Morocco. Napoleon professed himself\r\nsatisfied with this palpable absurdity: it appeared as if the events of the\r\nlast few months had left no trace on his mind. Immediately after the Peace\r\nof Tilsit he resumed his negotiations with Godoy upon the old friendly\r\nfooting, and brought them to a conclusion in the Treaty of Fontainebleau\r\n(Oct., 1807), which provided for the invasion of Portugal by a French and a\r\nSpanish army, and for its division into principalities, one of which was to\r\nbe conferred upon Godoy himself. The occupation of Portugal was duly\r\neffected, and Godoy looked forward to the speedy retirement of the French\r\nfrom the province which was to be his portion of the spoil.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon uses the enmity of Ferdinand against Godoy.]\r\n\r\n[Napoleon about to intervene as protector of Ferdinand.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon, however, had other ends in view. Spain, not Portugal, was the\r\ntrue prize. Napoleon had gradually formed the determination of taking Spain\r\ninto his own hands, and the dissensions of the Court itself enabled him to\r\nappear upon the scene as the judge to whom all parties appealed. The Crown\r\nPrince Ferdinand had long been at open enmity with Godoy and his own\r\nmother. So long as Ferdinand's Neapolitan wife was alive, her influence\r\nmade the Crown Prince the centre of the party hostile to France; but after\r\nher death in 1806, at a time when Godoy himself inclined to join Napoleon's\r\nenemies, Ferdinand took up a new position, and allied himself with the\r\nFrench Ambassador, at whose instigation he wrote to Napoleon, soliciting\r\nthe hand of a princess of the Napoleonic House. [145] Godoy, though unaware\r\nof the letter, discovered that Ferdinand was engaged in some intrigue. King\r\nCharles was made to believe that his son had entered into a conspiracy to\r\ndethrone him. The Prince was placed under arrest, and on the 30th of\r\nOctober, 1807, a royal proclamation appeared at Madrid, announcing that\r\nFerdinand had been detected in a conspiracy against his parents, and that\r\nhe was about to be brought to justice along with his accomplices. King\r\nCharles at the same time wrote a letter to Napoleon, of whose connection\r\nwith Ferdinand he had not the slightest suspicion, stating that he intended\r\nto exclude the Crown Prince from the succession to the throne of Spain. No\r\nsooner had Napoleon received the communication from the simple King than he\r\nsaw himself in possession of the pretext for intervention which he had so\r\nlong desired. The most pressing orders were given for the concentration of\r\ntroops on the Spanish frontier; Napoleon appeared to be on the point of\r\nentering Spain as the defender of the hereditary rights of Ferdinand. The\r\nopportunity, however, proved less favourable than Napoleon had expected.\r\nThe Crown Prince, overcome by his fears, begged forgiveness of his father,\r\nand disclosed the negotiations which had taken place between himself and\r\nthe French Ambassador. Godoy, dismayed at finding Napoleon's hand in what\r\nhe had supposed to be a mere palace-intrigue, abandoned all thought of\r\nproceeding further against the Crown Prince; and a manifesto announced that\r\nFerdinand was restored to the favour of his father. Napoleon now\r\ncountermanded the order which he had given for the despatch of the Rhenish\r\ntroops to the Pyrenees, and contented himself with directing General\r\nDupont, the commander of an army-corps nominally destined for Portugal, to\r\ncross the Spanish frontier and advance as far as Vittoria.\r\n\r\n[Dupont enters Spain, Dec., 1807.]\r\n\r\n[French welcomed in Spain as Ferdinand's protectors.]\r\n\r\nDupont's troops entered Spain in the last days of the year 1807, and were\r\nreceived with acclamations. It was universally believed that Napoleon had\r\nespoused the cause of Ferdinand, and intended to deliver the Spanish nation\r\nfrom the detested rule of Godoy. Since the open attack made upon Ferdinand\r\nin the publication of the pretended conspiracy, the Crown Prince, who was\r\npersonally as contemptible as any of his enemies, had become the idol of\r\nthe people. For years past the hatred of the nation towards Godoy and the\r\nQueen had been constantly deepening, and the very reforms which Godoy\r\neffected in the hope of attaching to himself the more enlightened classes\r\nonly served to complete his unpopularity with the fanatical mass of the\r\nnation. The French, who gradually entered the Peninsula to the number of\r\n80,000, and who described themselves as the protectors of Ferdinand and of\r\nthe true Catholic faith, were able to spread themselves over the northern\r\nprovinces without exciting suspicion. It was only when their commanders, by\r\na series of tricks worthy of American savages, obtained possession of the\r\nfrontier citadels and fortresses, that the wiser part of the nation began\r\nto entertain some doubt as to the real purpose of their ally. At the Court\r\nitself and among the enemies of Ferdinand the advance of the French roused\r\nthe utmost alarm. King Charles wrote to Napoleon in the tone of ancient\r\nfriendship; but the answer he received was threatening and mysterious. The\r\nutterances which the Emperor let fall in the presence of persons likely to\r\nreport them at Madrid were even more alarming, and were intended to terrify\r\nthe Court into the resolution to take flight from Madrid. The capital once\r\nabandoned by the King, Napoleon judged that he might safely take everything\r\ninto his own hands on the pretence of restoring to Spain the government\r\nwhich it had lost.\r\n\r\n[Murat sent to Spain, Feb., 1808.]\r\n\r\n[Charles IV. abdicates, March 17, 1808.]\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of February, 1808, Murat was ordered to quit Paris in order to\r\nassume the command in Spain. Not a word was said by Napoleon to him before\r\nhis departure. His instructions first reached him at Bayonne; they were of\r\na military nature, and gave no indication of the ultimate political object\r\nof his mission. Murat entered Spain on the 1st of March, knowing no more\r\nthan that he was ordered to reassure all parties and to commit himself to\r\nnone, but with full confidence that he himself was intended by Napoleon to\r\nbe the successor of the Bourbon dynasty. It was now that the Spanish Court,\r\nexpecting the appearance of the French army in Madrid, resolved upon that\r\nflight which Napoleon considered so necessary to his own success. The\r\nproject was not kept a secret. It passed from Godoy to the Ministers of\r\nState, and from them to the friends of Ferdinand. The populace of Madrid\r\nwas inflamed by the report that Godoy was about to carry the King to a\r\ndistance, in order to prolong the misgovernment which the French had\r\ndetermined to overthrow. A tumultuous crowd marched from the capital to\r\nAranjuez, the residence of the Court. On the evening of the 17th of March,\r\nthe palace of Godoy was stormed by the mob. Godoy himself was seized, and\r\ncarried to the barracks amid the blows and curses of the populace. The\r\nterrified King, who already saw before him the fate of his cousin, Louis\r\nXVI., first published a decree depriving Godoy of all his dignities, and\r\nthen abdicated in favour of his son. On the 19th of March Ferdinand was\r\nproclaimed King.\r\n\r\n[French enter Madrid, March 23.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the unexpected intelligence that met Murat as he approached\r\nMadrid. The dissensions of the Court, which were to supply his ground of\r\nintervention, had been terminated by the Spaniards themselves: in the place\r\nof a despised dotard and a menaced favourite, Spain had gained a youthful\r\nsovereign around whom all classes of the nation rallied with the utmost\r\nenthusiasm. Murat's position became a very difficult one; but he supplied\r\nwhat was wanting in his instructions by the craft of a man bent upon\r\ncreating a vacancy in his own favour. He sent his aide-de-camp, Monthieu,\r\nto visit the dethroned sovereign, and obtained a protest from King Charles\r\nIV., declaring his abdication to have been extorted from him by force, and\r\nconsequently to be null and void. This document Murat kept secret; but he\r\ncarefully abstained from doing anything which might involve a recognition\r\nof Ferdinand's title. On the 23rd of March the French troops entered\r\nMadrid. Nothing had as yet become known to the public that indicated an\r\naltered policy on the part of the French; and the soldiers of Murat, as the\r\nsupposed friends of Ferdinand, met with as friendly a reception in Madrid\r\nas in the other towns of Spain. On the following day Ferdinand himself made\r\nhis solemn entry into the capital, amid wild demonstrations of an almost\r\nbarbaric loyalty.\r\n\r\n[Savary brings Ferdinand to Bayonne, April, 1808.]\r\n\r\nIn the tumult of popular joy it was noticed that Murat's troops continued\r\ntheir exercises without the least regard to the pageant that so deeply\r\nstirred the hearts of the Spaniards. Suspicions were aroused; the\r\nenthusiasm of the people for the French soldiers began to change into\r\nirritation and ill-will. The end of the long drama of deceit was in fact\r\nnow close at hand. On the 4th of April General Savary arrived at Madrid\r\nwith instructions independent of those given to Murat. He was charged to\r\nentice the new Spanish sovereign from his capital, and to bring him, either\r\nas a dupe or as a prisoner, on to French soil. The task was not a difficult\r\none. Savary pretended that Napoleon had actually entered Spain, and that he\r\nonly required an assurance of Ferdinand's continued friendship before\r\nrecognising him as the legitimate successor of Charles IV. Ferdinand, he\r\nadded, could show no greater mark of cordiality to his patron than by\r\nadvancing to meet him on the road. Snared by these hopes, Ferdinand set out\r\nfrom Madrid, in company with Savary and some of his own foolish confidants.\r\nOn reaching Burgos, the party found no signs of the Emperor. They continued\r\ntheir journey to Vittoria. Here Ferdinand's suspicions were aroused, and he\r\ndeclined to proceed farther. Savary hastened to Bayonne to report the delay\r\nto Napoleon. He returned with a letter which overcame Ferdinand's scruples\r\nand induced him to cross the Pyrenees, in spite of the prayers of statesmen\r\nand the loyal violence of the simple inhabitants of the district. At\r\nBayonne Ferdinand was visited by Napoleon, but not a word was spoken on the\r\nobject of his journey. In the afternoon the Emperor received Ferdinand and\r\nhis suite at a neighbouring château, but preserved the same ominous\r\nsilence. When the other guests departed, the Canon Escoiquiz, a member of\r\nFerdinand's retinue, was detained, and learned from Napoleon's own lips the\r\nfate in store for the Bourbon Monarchy. Savary returned to Bayonne with\r\nFerdinand, and informed the Prince that he must renounce the crown of\r\nSpain. [146]\r\n\r\n[Charles and Ferdinand surrender their rights to Napoleon.]\r\n\r\n[Attack on the French in Madrid, May 2.]\r\n\r\nFor some days Ferdinand held out against Napoleon's demands with a\r\nstubbornness not often shown by him in the course of his mean and\r\nhypocritical career. He was assailed not only by Napoleon but by those\r\nwhose fall had been his own rise; for Godoy was sent to Bayonne by Murat,\r\nand the old King and Queen hurried after their son in order to witness his\r\nhumiliation. Ferdinand's parents attacked him with an indecency that\r\nastonished even Napoleon himself; but the Prince maintained his refusal\r\nuntil news arrived from Madrid which terrified him into submission. The\r\nirritation of the capital had culminated in an armed conflict between the\r\npopulace and the French troops. On an attempt being made by Murat to remove\r\nthe remaining members of the royal family from the palace, the capital had\r\nbroken into open insurrection, and wherever French soldiers were found\r\nalone or in small bodies they were massacred. (May 2.) Some hundreds of the\r\nFrench perished; but the victory of Murat was speedy, and his vengeance\r\nruthless. The insurgents were driven into the great central square of the\r\ncity, and cut down by repeated charges of cavalry. When all resistance was\r\nover, numbers of the citizens were shot in cold blood. Such was the\r\nintelligence which reached Bayonne in the midst of Napoleon's struggle with\r\nFerdinand. There was no further need of argument. Ferdinand was informed\r\nthat if he withheld his resignation for twenty-four hours longer he would\r\nbe treated as a rebel. He yielded; and for a couple of country houses and\r\ntwo life-annuities the crown of Spain and the Indies was renounced in\r\nfavour of Napoleon by father and son.\r\n\r\n[National spirit of the Spaniards.]\r\n\r\nThe crown had indeed been won without a battle. That there remained a\r\nSpanish nation ready to fight to the death for its independence was not a\r\ncircumstance which Napoleon had taken into account. His experience had as\r\nyet taught him of no force but that of Governments and armies. In the\r\nlarger States, or groups of States, which had hitherto been the spoil of\r\nFrance, the sense of nationality scarcely existed. Italy had felt it no\r\ndisgrace to pass under the rule of Napoleon. The Germans on both sides of\r\nthe Rhine knew of a fatherland only as an arena of the keenest jealousies.\r\nIn Prussia and in Austria the bond of citizenship was far less the love of\r\ncountry than the habit of obedience to government. England and Russia,\r\nwhere patriotism existed in the sense in which it existed in Spain, had as\r\nyet been untouched by French armies. Judging from the action of the Germans\r\nand the Italians, Napoleon might well suppose that in settling with the\r\nSpanish Government he had also settled with the Spanish people, or, at the\r\nworst, that his troops might have to fight some fanatical peasants, like\r\nthose who resisted the expulsion of the Bourbons from Naples. But the\r\nSpanish nation was no mosaic of political curiosities like the Holy Roman\r\nEmpire, and no divided and oblivious family like the population of Italy.\r\nSpain, as a single nation united under its King, had once played the\r\nforemost part in Europe: when its grandeur departed, its pride had remained\r\nbehind: the Spaniard, in all his torpor and impoverishment, retained the\r\nimpulse of honour, the spirited self-respect, which periods of national\r\ngreatness leave behind them among a race capable of cherishing their\r\nmemory. Nor had those influences of a common European culture, which\r\ndirectly opposed themselves to patriotism in Germany, affected the\r\nhome-bred energy of Spain. The temper of mind which could find satisfaction\r\nin the revival of a form of Greek art when Napoleon's cavalry were scouring\r\nGermany, or which could inquire whether mankind would not profit by the\r\nremoval of the barriers between nations, was unknown among the Spanish\r\npeople. Their feeling towards a foreign invader was less distant from that\r\nof African savages than from that of the civilised and literary nations\r\nwhich had fallen so easy a prey to the French. Government, if it had\r\ndegenerated into everything that was contemptible, had at least failed to\r\nreduce the people to the passive helplessness which resulted from the\r\nperfection of uniformity in Prussia. Provincial institutions, though\r\ncorrupted, were not extinguished; provincial attachments and prejudices\r\nexisted in unbounded strength. Like the passion of the Spaniard for his\r\nnative district, his passion for Spain was of a blind and furious\r\ncharacter. Enlightened conviction, though not altogether absent, had small\r\nplace in the Spanish war of defence. Religious fanaticism, hatred of the\r\nforeigner, delight in physical barbarity, played their full part by the\r\nside of nobler elements in the struggle for national independence.\r\n\r\n[Rising of Spain, May, 1808.]\r\n\r\nThe captivity of Ferdinand, and the conflict of Murat's troops with the\r\ninhabitants of Madrid, had become known in the Spanish cities before the\r\nmiddle of May. On the 20th of the same month the _Gaceta_ announced\r\nthe abdication of the Bourbon family. Nothing more was wanting to throw\r\nSpain into tumult. The same irresistible impulse seized provinces and\r\ncities separated by the whole breadth of the Peninsula. Without\r\ncommunication, and without the guidance of any central authority, the\r\nSpanish people in every part of the kingdom armed themselves against the\r\nusurper. Carthagena rose on the 22nd. Valencia forced its magistrates to\r\nproclaim King Ferdinand on the 23rd. Two days later the mountain-district\r\nof Asturias, with a population of half a million, formally declared war on\r\nNapoleon, and despatched envoys to Great Britain to ask for assistance. On\r\nthe 26th, Santander and Seville, on opposite sides of the Peninsula, joined\r\nthe national movement. Corunna, Badajoz, and Granada declared themselves on\r\nthe Feast of St. Ferdinand, the 30th of May. Thus within a week the entire\r\ncountry was in arms, except in those districts where the presence of French\r\ntroops rendered revolt impossible. The action of the insurgents was\r\neverywhere the same. They seized upon the arms and munitions of war\r\ncollected in the magazines, and forced the magistrates or commanders of\r\ntowns to place themselves at their head. Where the latter resisted, or were\r\nsuspected of treachery to the national cause, they were in many cases put\r\nto death. Committees of Government were formed in the principal cities, and\r\nas many armies came into being as there were independent centres of the\r\ninsurrection.\r\n\r\n[Joseph Bonaparte made King.]\r\n\r\n[Napoleon's Assembly at Bayonne, June, 1808.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon was in the meantime collecting a body of prelates and grandees at\r\nBayonne, under the pretence of consulting the representatives of the\r\nSpanish nation. Half the members of the intended Assembly received a\r\npersonal summons from the Emperor; the other half were ordered to be chosen\r\nby popular election. When the order, however, was issued from Bayonne, the\r\ncountry was already in full revolt. Elections were held only in the\r\ndistricts occupied by the French, and not more than twenty representatives\r\nso elected proceeded to Bayonne. The remainder of the Assembly, which\r\nnumbered in all ninety-one persons, was composed of courtiers who had\r\naccompanied the Royal Family across the Pyrenees, and of any Spaniards of\r\ndistinction upon whom the French could lay their hands. Joseph Bonaparte\r\nwas brought from Naples to receive the crown of Spain. [147] On the 15th of\r\nJune the Assembly of the Notables was opened. Its discussions followed the\r\norder prescribed by Napoleon on all similar occasions. Articles disguising\r\na central absolute power with some pretence of national representation were\r\nlaid before the Assembly, and adopted without criticism. Except in the\r\nprivileges accorded to the Church, little indicated that the Constitution\r\nof Bayonne was intended for the Spanish rather than for any other nation.\r\nIts political forms were as valuable or as valueless as those which\r\nNapoleon had given to his other client States; its principles of social\r\norder were those which even now despotism could not dissever from French\r\nsupremacy--the abolition of feudal services, equality of taxation,\r\nadmission of all ranks to public employment. Titles of nobility were\r\npreserved, the privileges of nobility abolished. One genuine act of homage\r\nwas rendered to the national character. The Catholic religion was declared\r\nto be the only one permitted in Spain.\r\n\r\n[Attempts of Napoleon to suppress the Spanish rising.]\r\n\r\nWhile Napoleon was thus emancipating the peasants from the nobles, and\r\nreconciling his supremacy with the claims of the Church, peasants and\r\ntownspeople were flocking to arms at the call of the priests, who so little\r\nappreciated the orthodoxy of their patron as to identify him in their\r\nmanifestos with Calvin, with the Antichrist, and with Apollyon. [148] The\r\nEmperor underrated the military efficiency of the national revolt, and\r\ncontented himself with sending his lieutenants to repress it, while he\r\nhimself, expecting a speedy report of victory, remained in Bayonne.\r\nDivisions of the French army moved in all directions against the\r\ninsurgents. Dupont was ordered to march upon Seville from the capital,\r\nMoncey upon Valencia; Marshal Bessières took command of a force intended to\r\ndisperse the main army of the Spaniards, which threatened the roads from\r\nthe Pyrenees to Madrid. The first encounters were all favourable to the\r\npractised French troops; yet the objects which Napoleon set before his\r\ngenerals were not achieved. Moncey failed to reduce Valencia; Dupont found\r\nhimself outnumbered on passing the Sierra Morena, and had to retrace his\r\nsteps and halt at Andujar, where the road to Madrid leaves the valley of\r\nthe Guadalquivir. Without sustaining any severe loss, the French divisions\r\nwere disheartened by exhausting and resultless marches; the Spaniards\r\ngained new confidence on each successive day which passed without\r\ninflicting upon them a defeat. At length, however, the commanders of the\r\nnorthern army were forced by Marshal Bessières to fight a pitched battle at\r\nRio Seco, on the west of Valladolid (July 13th). Bessières won a complete\r\nvictory, and gained the lavish praises of his master for a battle which,\r\naccording to Napoleon's own conception, ended the Spanish war by securing\r\nthe roads from the Pyrenees to Madrid.\r\n\r\n[Capitulation of Baylen, July 19.]\r\n\r\n[Dupont in Andalusia.]\r\n\r\nNever had Napoleon so gravely mistaken the true character of a campaign.\r\nThe vitality of the Spanish insurrection lay not in the support of the\r\ncapital, which had never passed out of the hands of the French, but in the\r\nvery independence of the several provincial movements. Unlike Vienna and\r\nBerlin, Madrid might be held by the French without the loss being felt by\r\ntheir adversary; Cadiz, Corunna, Lisbon, were equally serviceable bases for\r\nthe insurrection. The victory of Marshal Bessières in the north preserved\r\nthe communication between France and Madrid, and it did nothing more. It\r\nfailed to restore the balance of military force in the south of Spain, or\r\nto affect the operations of the Spanish troops which were now closing round\r\nDupont upon the Guadalquivir. On the 15th of July Dupont was attacked at\r\nAndujar by greatly superior forces. His lieutenant, Vedel, knowing the\r\nSpaniards to be engaged in a turning movement, made a long march northwards\r\nin order to guard the line of retreat. In his absence the position of\r\nBaylen, immediately in Dupont's rear, was seized by the Spanish general\r\nReding. Dupont discovered himself to be surrounded. He divided his army\r\ninto two columns, and moved on the night of the 18th from Andujar towards\r\nBaylen, in the hope of overpowering Reding's division. At daybreak on the\r\n19th the positions of Reding were attacked by the French. The struggle\r\ncontinued until mid-day, though the French soldiers sank exhausted with\r\nthirst and with the burning heat. At length the sound of cannon was heard\r\nin the rear. Castanos, the Spanish general commanding at Andujar, had\r\ndiscovered Dupont's retreat, and pressed behind him with troops fresh and\r\nunwearied by conflict. Further resistance was hopeless. Dupont had to\r\nnegotiate for a surrender. He consented to deliver up Vedel's division as\r\nwell as his own, although Vedel's troops were in possession of the road to\r\nMadrid, the Spanish commander promising, on this condition, that the\r\ncaptives should not be retained as prisoners of war in Spain, but be\r\npermitted to return by sea to their native country. The entire army of\r\nAndalusia, numbering 23,000 men, thus passed into the hands of an enemy\r\nwhom Napoleon had not believed to possess a military existence. Dupont's\r\nanxiety to save something for France only aggravated the extent of the\r\ncalamity; for the Junta of Seville declined to ratify the terms of the\r\ncapitulation, and the prisoners, with the exception of the superior\r\nofficers, were sent to the galleys at Cadiz. The victorious Spaniards\r\npushed forwards upon Madrid. King Joseph, who had entered the city only a\r\nweek before, had to fly from his capital. The whole of the French troops in\r\nSpain were compelled to retire to a defensive position upon the Ebro.\r\n\r\n[Wellesley lands in Portugal, Aug. 1, 1808.]\r\n\r\n[Vimieiro, Aug. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Convention of Cintra, Aug. 30.]\r\n\r\nThe disaster of Baylen did not come alone. Napoleon's attack upon Portugal\r\nhad brought him within the striking-range of Great Britain. On the 1st of\r\nAugust an English army, commanded by Sir Arthur Wellesley, landed on the\r\nPortuguese coast at the mouth of the Mondego. Junot, the first invader of\r\nthe Peninsula, was still at Lisbon; his forces in occupation of Portugal\r\nnumbered nearly 30,000 men, but they were widely dispersed, and he was\r\nunable to bring more than 13,000 men into the field against the 16,000 with\r\nwhom Wellesley moved upon Lisbon. Junot advanced to meet the invader. A\r\nbattle was fought at Vimieiro, thirty miles north of Lisbon, on the 21st of\r\nAugust. The victory was gained by the British; and had the first advantage\r\nbeen followed up, Junot's army would scarcely have escaped capture. But the\r\ncommand had passed out of Wellesley's hands. His superior officer, Sir\r\nHarry Burrard, took up the direction of the army immediately the battle\r\nended, and Wellesley had to acquiesce in a suspension of operations at a\r\nmoment when the enemy seemed to be within his grasp. Junot made the best\r\nuse of his reprieve. He entered into negotiations for the evacuation of\r\nPortugal, and obtained the most favourable terms in the Convention of\r\nCintra, signed on the 30th of August. The French army was permitted to\r\nreturn to France with its arms and baggage. Wellesley, who had strongly\r\ncondemned the inaction of his superior officers after the battle of the\r\n21st, agreed with them that, after the enemy had once been permitted to\r\nescape, the evacuation of Portugal was the best result which the English\r\ncould obtain. [149] Junot's troops were accordingly conveyed to French\r\nports at the expense of the British Government, to the great displeasure of\r\nthe public, who expected to see the marshal and his army brought prisoners\r\ninto Portsmouth. The English were as ill-humoured with their victory as the\r\nFrench with their defeat. When on the point of sending Junot to a\r\ncourt-martial for his capitulation, Napoleon learnt that the British\r\nGovernment had ordered its own generals to be brought to trial for\r\npermitting the enemy to escape them.\r\n\r\n[Effect of Spanish rising on Europe.]\r\n\r\n[War-party in Austria and Prussia.]\r\n\r\n[Napoleon and Prussia.]\r\n\r\nIf the Convention of Cintra gained little glory for England, the tidings of\r\nthe successful uprising of the Spanish people against Napoleon, and of\r\nDupont's capitulation at Baylen, created the deepest impression in every\r\ncountry of Europe that still entertained the thought of resistance to\r\nFrance. The first great disaster had befallen Napoleon's arms. It had been\r\ninflicted by a nation without a government, without a policy, without a\r\nplan beyond that of the liberation of its fatherland from the foreigner.\r\nWhat Coalition after Coalition had failed to effect, the patriotism and\r\nenergy of a single people deserted by its rulers seemed about to\r\naccomplish. The victory of the regular troops at Baylen was but a part of\r\nthat great national movement in which every isolated outbreak had had its\r\nshare in dividing and paralysing the Emperor's force. The capacity of\r\nuntrained popular levies to resist practised troops might be exaggerated in\r\nthe first outburst of wonder and admiration caused by the Spanish rising;\r\nbut the difference made in the nature of the struggle by the spirit of\r\npopular resentment and determination was one upon which mistake was\r\nimpossible. A sudden light broke in upon the politicians of Austria and\r\nPrussia, and explained the powerlessness of those Coalitions in which the\r\nwars had always been the affair of the Cabinets, and never the affair of\r\nthe people. What the Spanish nation had effected for itself against\r\nNapoleon was not impossible for the German nation, if once a national\r\nmovement like that of Spain sprang up among the German race. \"I do not\r\nsee,\" wrote Blücher some time afterwards, \"why we should not think\r\nourselves as good as the Spaniards.\" The best men in the Austrian and\r\nPrussian Governments began to look forward to the kindling of popular\r\nspirit as the surest means for combating the tyranny of Napoleon. Military\r\npreparations were pushed forward in Austria with unprecedented energy and\r\non a scale rivalling that of France itself. In Prussia the party of Stein\r\ndetermined upon a renewal of the war, and decided to risk the extinction of\r\nthe Prussian State rather than submit to the extortions by which Napoleon\r\nwas completing the ruin of their country. It was among the patriots of\r\nNorthern Germany that the course of the Spanish struggle excited the\r\ndeepest emotion, and gave rise to the most resolute purpose of striking for\r\nEuropean liberty.\r\n\r\nSince the nominal restoration of peace between France and Prussia by the\r\ncession of half the Prussian kingdom, not a month had passed without the\r\ninfliction of some gross injustice upon the conquered nation. The\r\nevacuation of the country had in the first instance been made conditional\r\nupon the payment of certain requisitions in arrear. While the amount of\r\nthis sum was being settled, all Prussia, except Königsberg, remained in the\r\nhands of the French, and 157,000 French soldiers lived at free quarters\r\nupon the unfortunate inhabitants. At the end of the year 1807 King\r\nFrederick William was informed that, besides paying to Napoleon 60,000,000\r\nfrancs in money, and ceding domain lands of the same value, he must\r\ncontinue to support 40,000 French troops in five garrison-towns upon the\r\nOder. Such was the dismay caused by this announcement, that Stein quitted\r\nKönigsberg, now the seat of government, and passed three months at the\r\nhead-quarters of the French at Berlin, endeavouring to frame some\r\nsettlement less disastrous to his country. Count Daru, Napoleon's\r\nadministrator in Prussia, treated the Minister with respect, and accepted\r\nhis proposal for the evacuation of Prussian territory on payment of a fixed\r\nsum to the French. But the agreement required Napoleon's ratification, and\r\nfor this Stein waited in vain. [150]\r\n\r\n[Stein urges war.]\r\n\r\n[Demands of Napoleon, Sept., 1808.]\r\n\r\nMonth after month dragged on, and Napoleon made no reply. At length the\r\nvictories of the Spanish insurrection in the summer of 1808 forced the\r\nEmperor to draw in his troops from beyond the Elbe. He placed a bold front\r\nupon his necessities, and demanded from the Prussian Government, as the\r\nprice of evacuation, a still larger sum than that which had been named in\r\nthe previous winter: he insisted that the Prussian army should be limited\r\nto 40,000 men, and the formation of the Landwehr abandoned; and he required\r\nthe support of a Prussian corps of 16,000 men, in the event of hostilities\r\nbreaking out between France and Austria. Not even on these conditions was\r\nPrussia offered the complete evacuation of her territory. Napoleon still\r\ninsisted on holding the three principal fortresses on the Oder with a\r\ngarrison of 10,000 men. Such was the treaty proposed to the Prussian Court\r\n(September, 1808) at a time when every soldierly spirit thrilled with the\r\ntidings from Spain, and every statesman was convinced by the events of the\r\nlast few months that Napoleon's treaties were but stages in a progression\r\nof wrongs. Stein and Scharnhorst urged the King to arm the nation for a\r\nstruggle as desperate as that of Spain, and to delay only until Napoleon\r\nhimself was busied in the warfare of the Peninsula. Continued submission\r\nwas ruin; revolt was at least not hopeless. However forlorn the condition\r\nof Prussia, its alliances were of the most formidable character. Austria\r\nwas arming without disguise; Great Britain had intervened in the warfare of\r\nthe Peninsula with an efficiency hitherto unknown in its military\r\noperations; Spain, on the estimate of Napoleon himself, required an army of\r\n200,000 men. Since the beginning of the Spanish insurrection Stein had\r\noccupied himself with the organisation of a general outbreak throughout\r\nNorthern Germany. Rightly or wrongly, he believed the train to be now laid,\r\nand encouraged the King of Prussia to count upon the support of a popular\r\ninsurrection against the French in all the territories which they had taken\r\nfrom Prussia, from Hanover, and from Hesse.\r\n\r\n[Stein resigns, Nov. 24. Proscribed by Napoleon.]\r\n\r\n[Napoleon and Alexander meet at Erfurt, Oct. 7, 1808.]\r\n\r\nIn one point alone Stein was completely misinformed. He believed that\r\nAlexander, in spite of the Treaty of Tilsit, would not be unwilling to see\r\nthe storm burst upon Napoleon, and that in the event of another general war\r\nthe forces of Russia would more probably be employed against France than in\r\nits favour. The illusion was a fatal one. Alexander was still the\r\naccomplice of Napoleon. For the sake of the Danubian Principalities,\r\nAlexander was willing to hold central Europe in check while Napoleon\r\ncrushed the Spaniards, and to stifle every bolder impulse in the simple\r\nKing of Prussia. Napoleon himself dreaded the general explosion of Europe\r\nbefore Spain was conquered, and drew closer to his Russian ally.\r\nDifficulties that had been placed in the way of the Russian annexation of\r\nRoumania vanished. The Czar and the Emperor determined to display to all\r\nEurope the intimacy of their union by a festal meeting at Erfurt in the\r\nmidst of their victims and their dependents. The whole tribe of vassal\r\nGerman sovereigns was summoned to the meeting-place; representatives\r\nattended from the Courts of Vienna and Berlin. On the 7th of October\r\nNapoleon and Alexander made their entry into Erfurt. Pageants and\r\nfestivities required the attendance of the crowned and titled rabble for\r\nseveral days; but the only serious business was the settlement of a treaty\r\nconfirming the alliance of France and Russia, and the notification of the\r\nCzar to the envoy of the King of Prussia that his master must accept the\r\nterms demanded by Napoleon, and relinquish the idea of a struggle with\r\nFrance. [151] Count Goltz, the Prussian envoy, unwillingly signed the\r\ntreaty which gave Prussia but a partial evacuation at so dear a cost, and\r\nwrote to the King that no course now remained for him but to abandon\r\nhimself to unreserved dependence upon France, and to permit Stein and the\r\npatriotic party to retire from the direction of the State. Unless the King\r\ncould summon up courage to declare war in defiance of Alexander, there was,\r\nin fact, no alternative left open to him. Napoleon had discovered Stein's\r\nplans for raising an insurrection in Germany several weeks before, and had\r\ngiven vent to the most furious outburst of wrath against Stein in the\r\npresence of the Prussian Ambassador at Erfurt. If the great struggle on\r\nwhich Stein's whole heart and soul were set was to be relinquished, if\r\nSpain was to be crushed before Prussia moved an arm, and Austria was to be\r\nleft to fight its inevitable battle alone, then the presence of Stein at\r\nthe head of the Prussian State was only a snare to Europe, a peril to\r\nPrussia, and a misery to himself. Stein asked for and received his\r\ndismissal. (Nov. 24, 1808.)\r\n\r\nStein's retirement averted the wrath of Napoleon from the King of Prussia;\r\nbut the whole malignity of that Corsican nature broke out against the\r\nhigh-spirited patriot as soon as fresh victories had released Napoleon from\r\nthe ill-endured necessity of self-control. On the 16th of December, when\r\nMadrid had again passed into the possession of the French, an imperial\r\norder appeared, which gave the measure of Napoleon's hatred of the fallen\r\nMinister. Stein was denounced as the enemy of the Empire; his property was\r\nconfiscated; he was ordered to be seized by the troops of the Emperor or\r\nhis allies wherever they could lay their hands upon him. As in the days of\r\nRoman tyranny, the west of Europe could now afford no asylum to the enemies\r\nof the Emperor. Russia and Austria remained the only refuge of the exile.\r\nStein escaped into Bohemia; and, as the crowning humiliation of the\r\nPrussian State, its police were forced to pursue as a criminal the\r\nstatesman whose fortitude had still made it possible in the darkest days\r\nfor Prussian patriots not to despair of their country.\r\n\r\n[Misgovernment of the Spanish Junta.]\r\n\r\n[Napoleon goes to Spain, Nov., 1808.]\r\n\r\nCentral Europe secured by the negotiations with Alexander at Erfurt,\r\nNapoleon was now able to place himself at the head of the French forces in\r\nSpain without fear of any immediate attack from the side of Germany. Since\r\nthe victory of Baylen the Spaniards had made little progress either towards\r\ngood government or towards a good military administration. The provincial\r\nJuntas had consented to subordinate themselves to a central committee\r\nchosen from among their own members; but this new supreme authority, which\r\nheld its meetings at Aranjuez, proved one of the worst governments that\r\neven Spain itself had ever endured. It numbered thirty persons,\r\ntwenty-eight of whom were priests, nobles, or officials. [152] Its\r\nqualities were those engrained in Spanish official life. In legislation it\r\nattempted absolutely nothing but the restoration of the Inquisition and the\r\nprotection of Church lands; its administration was confined to a foolish\r\ninterference with the better generals, and the acquisition of enormous\r\nsupplies of war from Great Britain, which were either stolen by contractors\r\nor allowed to fall into the hands of the French. While the members of the\r\nJunta discussed the titles of honour which were to attach to them\r\ncollectively and individually, and voted themselves salaries equal to those\r\nof Napoleon's generals, the armies fell into a state of destitution which\r\nscarcely any but Spanish troops would have been capable of enduring. The\r\nenergy of the humbler classes alone prolonged the military existence of the\r\ninsurrection; the Government organised nothing, comprehended nothing. Its\r\npart in the national movement was confined to a system of begging and\r\nboasting, which demoralised the Spaniards, and bewildered the agents and\r\ngenerals of England who first attempted the difficult task of assisting the\r\nSpaniards to help themselves. When the approach of army after army, the\r\nlevies of Germany, Poland, Holland, and Italy, in addition to Napoleon's\r\nown veteran troops of Austerlitz and Jena, gave to the rest of the world\r\nsome idea of the enormous force which Napoleon was about to throw on to\r\nSpain, the Spanish Government could form no better design than to repeat\r\nthe movement of Baylen against Napoleon himself on the banks of the Ebro.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon enters Madrid, Dec. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Campaign on the Ebro, Nov., 1808.]\r\n\r\nThe Emperor for the first time crossed the Pyrenees in the beginning of\r\nNovember, 1808. The victory of the Spaniards in the summer had forced the\r\ninvaders to retire into the district between the Ebro and the Pyrenees, and\r\nthe Ebro now formed the dividing-line between the hostile armies. It was\r\nthe intention of Napoleon to roll back the extremes of the Spanish line to\r\nthe east and the west, and, breaking through its centre, to move straight\r\nupon Burgos and Madrid. The Spaniards, for their part, were not content to\r\nact upon the defensive. When Napoleon arrived at Vittoria on the 5th of\r\nNovember, the left wing of the Spanish army under General Blake had already\r\nreceived orders to move eastwards from the upper waters of the Ebro, and to\r\ncut the French off from their communication with the Pyrenees. The movement\r\nwas exactly that which Napoleon desired; for in executing it, Blake had\r\nonly to march far enough eastwards to find himself completely surrounded by\r\nFrench divisions. A premature movement of the French generals themselves\r\nalone saved Blake from total destruction. He was attacked and defeated at\r\nEspinosa, on the upper Ebro, before he had advanced far enough to lose his\r\nline of retreat (Nov. 10); and, after suffering great losses, he succeeded\r\nin leading off a remnant of his army into the mountains of Asturias. In the\r\ncentre, Soult drove the enemy before him, and captured Burgos. Of the army\r\nwhich was to have cleared Spain of the French, nothing now remained but a\r\ncorps on the right at Tudela, commanded by Palafox. The destruction of this\r\nbody was committed by the Emperor to Lannes and Ney. Ney was ordered to\r\ntake a long march southwards in order to cut off the retreat of the\r\nSpaniards; he found it impossible, however, to execute his march within the\r\ntime prescribed; and Palafox, beaten by Lannes at Tudela, made good his\r\nretreat into Saragossa. A series of accidents had thus saved the divisions\r\nof the Spanish army from actual capture, but there no longer existed a\r\nforce capable of meeting the enemy in the field. Napoleon moved forward\r\nfrom Burgos upon Madrid. The rest of his march was a triumph. The batteries\r\ndefending the mountain-pass of Somo Sierra were captured by a charge of\r\nPolish cavalry; and the capital itself surrendered, after a short artillery\r\nfire, on the 4th of December, four weeks after the opening of the campaign.\r\n\r\n[Campaign of Sir John Moore.]\r\n\r\nAn English army was slowly and painfully making its way towards the Ebro at\r\nthe time when Napoleon broke in pieces the Spanish line of defence. On the\r\n14th of October Sir John Moore had assumed the command of 20,000 British\r\ntroops at Lisbon. He was instructed to march to the neighbourhood of\r\nBurgos, and to co-operate with the Spanish generals upon the Ebro.\r\nAccording to the habit of the English, no allowance was made for the\r\nmovements of the enemy while their own were under consideration; and the\r\nmountain-country which Moore had to traverse placed additional obstacles in\r\nthe way of an expedition at least a month too late in its starting. Moore\r\nbelieved it to be impossible to carry his artillery over the direct road\r\nfrom Lisbon to Salamanca, and sent it round by way of Madrid, while he\r\nhimself advanced through Ciudad Rodrigo, reaching Salamanca on the 13th of\r\nNovember. Here, while still waiting for his artillery, rumours reached him\r\nof the destruction of Blake's army at Espinosa, and of the fall of Burgos.\r\nLater came the report of Palafox's overthrow at Tudela. Yet even now Moore\r\ncould get no trustworthy information from the Spanish authorities. He\r\nremained for some time in suspense, and finally determined to retreat into\r\nPortugal. Orders were sent to Sir David Baird, who was approaching with\r\nreinforcements from Corunna, to turn back towards the northern coast.\r\nScarcely had Moore formed this decision, when despatches arrived from\r\nFrere, the British agent at Madrid, stating that the Spaniards were about\r\nto defend the capital to the last extremity, and that Moore would be\r\nresponsible for the ruin of Spain and the disgrace of England if he failed\r\nto advance to its relief. To the great joy of his soldiers, Moore gave\r\norders for a forward march. The army advanced upon Valladolid, with the\r\nview of attacking the French upon their line of communication, while the\r\nsiege of the capital engaged them in front. Baird was again ordered\r\nsouthwards. It was not until the 14th of December, ten days after Madrid\r\nhad passed into the hands of the French, that Moore received intelligence\r\nof its fall. Neither the Spanish Government nor the British agent who had\r\ncaused Moore to advance took the trouble to inform him of the surrender of\r\nthe capital; he learnt it from an intercepted French despatch. From the\r\nsame despatch Moore learnt that to the north of him, at Saldanha, on the\r\nriver Carrion, there lay a comparatively small French force under the\r\ncommand of Soult. The information was enough for Moore, heart-sick at the\r\nmockery to which his army had been subjected, and burning for decisive\r\naction. He turned northwards, and marched against Soult, in the hope of\r\nsurprising him before the news of his danger could reach Napoleon in the\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon marches against Moore, Dec. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Retreat of the English.]\r\n\r\n[Corunna, Jan. 16, 1809.]\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of December a report reached Madrid that Moore had suspended\r\nhis retreat on Portugal. Napoleon instantly divined the actual movement of\r\nthe English, and hurried from Madrid against Moore at the head of 40,000\r\nmen. Moore had met Baird on the 20th at Mayorga; on the 23rd the united\r\nBritish divisions reached Sahagun, scarcely a day's march from Soult at\r\nSaldanha. Here the English commander learnt that Napoleon himself was on\r\nhis track. Escape was a question of hours. Napoleon had pushed across the\r\nGuadarama mountains in forced marches through snow and storm. Had his\r\nvanguard been able to seize the bridge over the river Esla at Benavente\r\nbefore the English crossed it, Moore would have been cut off from all\r\npossibility of escape. The English reached the river first and blew up the\r\nbridge. This rescued them from immediate danger. The defence of the river\r\ngave Moore's army a start which rendered the superiority of Napoleon's\r\nnumbers of little effect. For a while Napoleon followed Moore towards the\r\nnorthern coast. On the 1st of January, 1809, he wrote an order which showed\r\nthat he looked upon Moore's escape as now inevitable, and on the next day\r\nhe quitted the army, leaving to his marshals the honour of toiling after\r\nMoore to the coast, and of seizing some thousands of frozen or drunken\r\nBritish stragglers. Moore himself pushed on towards Corunna with a rapidity\r\nwhich was dearly paid for by the demoralisation of his army. The sufferings\r\nand the excesses of the troops were frightful; only the rear-guard, which\r\nhad to face the enemy, preserved soldierly order. At length Moore found it\r\nnecessary to halt and take up position, in order to restore the discipline\r\nof his army. He turned upon Soult at Lugo, and offered battle for two\r\nsuccessive days; but the French general declined an engagement; and Moore,\r\nsatisfied with having recruited his troops, continued his march upon\r\nCorunna. Soult still followed. On January 11th the English army reached the\r\nsea; but the ships which were to convey them back to England were nowhere\r\nto be seen. A battle was inevitable, and Moore drew up his troops, 14,000\r\nin number, on a range of low hills outside the town to await the attack of\r\nthe French. On the 16th, when the fleet had now come into harbour, Soult\r\ngave battle. The French were defeated at every point of their attack. Moore\r\nfell at the moment of his victory, conscious that the army which he had so\r\nbravely led had nothing more to fear. The embarkation was effected that\r\nnight; on the next day the fleet put out to sea.\r\n\r\n[Siege of Saragossa, Dec., 1808.]\r\n\r\n[Napoleon leaves Spain, Jan 19, 1809.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon quitted Spain on the 19th of January, 1809, leaving his brother\r\nJoseph again in possession of the capital, and an army of 300,000 men under\r\nthe best generals of France engaged with the remnants of a defeated force\r\nwhich had never reached half that number. No brilliant victories remained\r\nto be won; no enemy remained in the field important enough to require the\r\npresence of Napoleon. Difficulties of transit and the hostility of the\r\npeople might render the subjugation of Spain a slower process than the\r\nsubjugation of Prussia or Italy; but, to all appearance, the ultimate\r\nsuccess of the Emperor's plans was certain, and the worst that lay before\r\nhis lieutenants was a series of wearisome and obscure exertions against an\r\ninconsiderable foe. Yet, before the Emperor had been many weeks in Paris, a\r\nreport reached him from Marshal Lannes which told of some strange form of\r\nmilitary capacity among the people whose armies were so contemptible in the\r\nfield. The city of Saragossa, after successfully resisting its besiegers in\r\nthe summer of 1808, had been a second time invested after the defeats of\r\nthe Spanish armies upon the Ebro. [153] The besiegers themselves were\r\nsuffering from extreme scarcity when, on the 22nd of January, 1809, Lannes\r\ntook up the command. Lannes immediately called up all the troops within\r\nreach, and pressed the battering operations with the utmost vigour. On the\r\n29th, the walls of Saragossa were stormed in four different places.\r\n\r\n[Defeats of the Spaniards, March, 1809.]\r\n\r\nAccording to all ordinary precedents of war, the French were now in\r\npossession of the city. But the besiegers found that their real work was\r\nonly beginning. The streets were trenched and barricaded; every dwelling\r\nwas converted into a fortress; for twenty days the French were forced to\r\nbesiege house by house. In the centre of the town the popular leaders\r\nerected a gallows, and there they hanged every one who flinched from\r\nmeeting the enemy. Disease was added to the horrors of warfare. In the\r\ncellars, where the women and children crowded in filth and darkness, a\r\nmalignant pestilence broke out, which, at the beginning of February, raised\r\nthe deaths to five hundred a day. The dead bodies were unburied; in that\r\npoisoned atmosphere the slightest wound produced mortification and death.\r\nAt length the powers of the defenders sank. A fourth part of the town had\r\nbeen won by the French; of the townspeople and peasants who were within the\r\nwalls at the beginning of the siege, it is said that thirty thousand had\r\nperished; the remainder could only prolong their defence to fall in a few\r\ndays more before disease or the enemy. Even now there were members of the\r\nJunta who wished to fight as long as a man remained, but they were\r\noutnumbered. On the 20th of February what was left of Saragossa\r\ncapitulated. Its resistance gave to the bravest of Napoleon's soldiers an\r\nimpression of horror and dismay new even to men who had passed through\r\nseventeen years of revolutionary warfare, but it failed to retard\r\nNapoleon's armies in the conquest of Spain. No attempt was made to relieve\r\nthe heroic or ferocious city. Everywhere the tide of French conquest\r\nappeared to be steadily making its advance. Soult invaded Portugal; in\r\ncombination with him, two armies moved from Madrid upon the southern and\r\nthe south-western provinces of Spain. Oporto fell on the 28th of March; in\r\nthe same week the Spanish forces covering the south were decisively beaten\r\nat Ciudad Real and at Medellin upon the line of the Guadiana. The hopes of\r\nEurope fell. Spain itself could expect no second Saragossa. It appeared as\r\nif the complete subjugation of the Peninsula could now only be delayed by\r\nthe mistakes of the French generals themselves, and by the untimely removal\r\nof that controlling will which had hitherto made every movement a step\r\nforward in conquest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAustria preparing for war--The war to be one on behalf of the German\r\nNation--Patriotic Movement in Prussia--Expected Insurrection in North\r\nGermany--Plans of Campaign--Austrian Manifesto to the Germans--Rising of\r\nthe Tyrolese--Defeats of the Archduke Charles in Bavaria--French in\r\nVienna--Attempts of Dörnberg and Schill--Battle of Aspern--Second Passage\r\nof the Danube--Battle of Wagram--Armistice of Znaim--Austria waiting for\r\nevents--Wellesley in Spain--He gains the Battle of Talavera, but\r\nretreats--Expedition against Antwerp fails--Austria makes Peace--Treaty of\r\nVienna--Real Effects of the War of 1809--Austria after 1809--Metternich--\r\nMarriage of Napoleon with Marie Louise--Severance of Napoleon and\r\nAlexander--Napoleon annexes the Papal States, Holland, La Valais, and the\r\nNorth German Coast--The Napoleonic Empire: Its Benefits and Wrongs--The\r\nCzar withdraws from Napoleon's Commercial System--War with Russia\r\nimminent--Wellington in Portugal: Lines of Torres Vedras; Massena's\r\nCampaign of 1810, and retreat--Soult in Andalusia--Wellington's Campaign\r\nof 1810--Capture of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz--Salamanca.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Austria preparing for war, 1808-9.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon, quitting Spain in the third week of January, 1809, travelled to\r\nParis with the utmost haste. He believed Austria to be on the point of\r\ndeclaring war; and on the very day of his arrival at the capital he called\r\nout the contingents of the Rhenish Federation. In the course of the next\r\nfew weeks, however, he formed the opinion that Austria would either decline\r\nhostilities altogether, or at least find it impossible to declare war\r\nbefore the middle of May. For once the efforts of Austria outstripped the\r\ncalculations of her enemy. Count Stadion, the earnest and enlightened\r\nstatesman who had held power in Austria since the Peace of Presburg, had\r\nsteadily prepared for a renewal of the struggle with France. He was\r\nconvinced that Napoleon would soon enter upon new enterprises of conquest,\r\nand still farther extend his empire at the expense of Austria, unless\r\nattacked before Spain had fallen under his dominion. Metternich, now\r\nAustrian Ambassador at Paris, reported that Napoleon was intending to\r\ndivide Turkey as soon as he had conquered Spain; and, although he advised\r\ndelay, he agreed with the Cabinet at Vienna that Austria must sooner or\r\nlater strike in self-defence. [154] Stadion, more sanguine, was only\r\nprevented from declaring war in 1808 by the counsels of the Archduke\r\nCharles and of other generals who were engaged in bringing the immense mass\r\nof new levies into military formation. Charles himself attached little\r\nvalue to the patriotic enthusiasm which, since the outbreak of the Spanish\r\ninsurrection, had sprung up in the German provinces of Austria. He saw the\r\napproach of war with more apprehension than pleasure; but, however faint\r\nhis own hopes, he laboured earnestly in creating for Austria a force far\r\nsuperior to anything that she had possessed before, and infused into the\r\nmass of the army that confident and patriotic spirit which he saw in others\r\nrather than felt in himself. By the beginning of March, 1809, Austria had\r\n260,000 men ready to take the field.\r\n\r\n[The war of 1809 to be a war for Germany.]\r\n\r\nThe war now breaking out was to be a war for the German nation, as the\r\nstruggle of the Spaniards had been a struggle for Spain. The animated\r\nappeals of the Emperor's generals formed a singular contrast to the silence\r\nwith which the Austrian Cabinet had hitherto entered into its wars. The\r\nHapsburg sovereign now stood before the world less as the inheritor of an\r\nancient empire and the representative of the Balance of Power than as the\r\ndisinterested champion of the German race. On the part of the Emperor\r\nhimself the language of devotion for Germany was scarcely more than\r\nironical. Francis belonged to an age and to a system in which the idea of\r\nnationality had no existence; and, like other sovereigns, he regarded his\r\npossessions as a sort of superior property which ought to be defended by\r\nobedient domestic dogs against marauding foreign wolves. The same personal\r\nview of public affairs had hitherto satisfied the Austrians. It had been\r\nenough for them to be addressed as the dutiful children of a wise and\r\naffectionate father. The Emperor spoke the familiar Viennese dialect; he\r\nwas as homely in his notions and his prejudices as any beerseller in his\r\ndominions; his subjects might see him at almost any hour of the day or\r\nnight; and out of the somewhat tough material of his character popular\r\nimagination had no difficulty in framing an idol of parental geniality and\r\nwisdom. Fifteen years of failure and mismanagement had, however, impaired\r\nthe beauty of the domestic fiction; and although old-fashioned Austrians,\r\nlike Haydn, the composer of the Austrian Hymn, were ready to go down to the\r\ngrave invoking a blessing on their gracious master, the Emperor himself and\r\nhis confidants were shrewd enough to see that the newly-excited sense of\r\nGerman patriotism would put them in possession of a force which they could\r\nhardly evoke by the old methods.\r\n\r\n[Austrian Parties.]\r\n\r\nOne element of reality lay in the professions which were not for the most\r\npart meant very seriously. There was probably now no statesman in Austria\r\nwho any longer felt a jealousy of the power of Prussia. With Count Stadion\r\nand his few real supporters the restoration of Germany was a genuine and\r\ndeeply-cherished desire; with the majority of Austrian politicians the\r\ninterests of Austria herself seemed at least for the present to require the\r\nliberation of North Germany. Thus the impassioned appeals of the Archduke\r\nCharles to all men of German race to rise against their foreign oppressor,\r\nand against their native princes who betrayed the interests of the\r\nFatherland, gained the sanction of a Court hitherto very little inclined to\r\nform an alliance with popular agitation. If the chaotic disorder of the\r\nAustrian Government had been better understood in Europe, less importance\r\nwould have been attached to this sudden change in its tone. No one in the\r\nhigher ranks at Vienna was bound by the action of his colleagues. The\r\nEmperor, though industrious, had not the capacity to enforce any coherent\r\nsystem of government. His brothers caballed one against another, and\r\nagainst the persons who figured as responsible ministers. State-papers were\r\nbrought by soldiers to the Emperor for his signature without the knowledge\r\nof his advisers. The very manifestos which seemed to herald a new era for\r\nGermany owed most of their vigour to the literary men who were entrusted\r\nwith their composition. [155]\r\n\r\n[Patriotic movement in Prussia.]\r\n\r\n[Governing classes in South Germany on the side of Napoleon.]\r\n\r\nThe answer likely to be rendered by Germany to the appeal of Austria was\r\nuncertain. In the Rhenish Federation there were undoubted signs of\r\ndiscontent with French rule among the common people; but the official\r\nclasses were universally on the side of Napoleon, who had given them their\r\nposts and their salaries; while the troops, and especially the officers,\r\nwho remembered the time when they had been mocked by the Austrians as\r\n\"harlequins\" and \"nose-bags,\" were won by the kindness of the great\r\nconqueror, who organised them under the hands of his own generals, and gave\r\nthem the companionship of his own victorious legions. Little could be\r\nexpected from districts where to the mass of the population the old régime\r\nof German independence had meant nothing more than attendance at the\r\nmanor-court of a knight, or the occasional spectacle of a ducal wedding, or\r\na deferred interest in the droning jobbery of some hereditary\r\ntown-councillor. In Northern Germany there was far more prospect of a\r\nnational insurrection. There the spirit of Stein and of those who had\r\nworked with him was making itself felt, in spite of the fall of the\r\nMinister. Scharnhorst's reforms had made the Prussian army a school of\r\npatriotism, and the work of statesmen and soldiers was promoted by men who\r\nspoke to the feelings and the intelligence of the nation. Literature lost\r\nits indifference to nationality and to home. The philosopher Fichte, the\r\npoet Arndt, the theologian Schleiermacher pressed the claims of Germany and\r\nof the manlier virtues upon a middle class singularly open to literary\r\ninfluences, singularly wanting in the experience and the impulses of active\r\npublic life. [156] In the Kingdom of Westphalia preparations for an\r\ninsurrection against the French were made by officers who had served in the\r\nPrussian and the Hessian armies. In Prussia itself, by the side of many\r\nnobler agencies, the newly-founded Masonic society of the Tugendbund, or\r\nLeague of Virtue, made the cause of the Fatherland popular among thousands\r\nto whom it was an agreeable novelty to belong to any society at all. No\r\nspontaneous, irresistible uprising, like that which Europe had seen in the\r\nSpanish Peninsula, was to be expected among the unimpulsive population of\r\nthe North German plains; but the military circles of Prussia were generally\r\nin favour of war, and an insurrection of the population west of the Elbe\r\nwas not improbable in the event of Napoleon's army being defeated by\r\nAustria in the field. King Frederick William, too timid to resolve upon war\r\nhimself, too timid even to look with satisfaction upon the bold attitude of\r\nAustria, had every reason for striking, if once the balance should incline\r\nagainst Napoleon: even against his own inclination it was possible that the\r\nardour of his soldiers might force him into war.\r\n\r\n[Plans of campaign.]\r\n\r\nSo strong were the hopes of a general rising in Northern Germany, that the\r\nAustrian Government to some extent based its plans for the campaign on this\r\nevent. In the ordinary course of hostilities between France and Austria the\r\nline of operations in Germany is the valley of the Danube; but in preparing\r\nfor the war of 1809 the Austrian Government massed its forces in the\r\nnorth-west of Bohemia, with the object of throwing them directly upon\r\nCentral Germany. The French troops which were now evacuating Prussia were\r\nstill on their way westwards at the time when Austria was ready to open the\r\ncampaign. Davoust, with about 60,000 men, was in Northern Bavaria,\r\nseparated by a great distance from the nearest French divisions in Baden\r\nand on the Rhine. By a sudden incursion of the main army of Austria across\r\nthe Bohemian mountains, followed by an uprising in Northern Germany,\r\nDavoust and his scattered detachments could hardly escape destruction. Such\r\nwas the original plan of the campaign, and it was probably a wise one in\r\nthe present exceptional superiority of the Austrian preparations over those\r\nof France. For the first time since the creation of the Consulate it\r\nappeared as if the opening advantages of the war must inevitably be upon\r\nthe side of the enemies of France. Napoleon had underrated both the energy\r\nand the resources of his adversary. By the middle of March, when the\r\nAustrians were ready to descend upon Davoust from Bohemia, Napoleon's first\r\ntroops had hardly crossed the Rhine. Fortunately for the French commander,\r\nthe Austrian Government, at the moment of delivering its well-planned blow,\r\nwas seized with fear at its own boldness. Recollections of Hohenlinden and\r\nUlm filled anxious minds with the thought that the valley of the Danube was\r\ninsufficiently defended; and on the 20th of March, when the army was on the\r\npoint of breaking into Northern Bavaria, orders were given to divert the\r\nline of march to the south, and to enter the Rhenish Confederacy by the\r\nroads of the Danube and the Inn. Thus the fruit of so much energy, and of\r\nthe enemy's rare neglectfulness, was sacrificed at the last moment. It was\r\nnot until the 9th of April that the Austrian movement southward was\r\ncompleted, and that the army lay upon the line of the Inn, ready to attack\r\nNapoleon in the territory of his principal German ally.\r\n\r\n[Austrian manifesto to the Germans.]\r\n\r\nThe proclamations now published by the Emperor and the Archduke bore\r\nstriking testimony to the influence of the Spanish insurrection in exciting\r\nthe sense of national right, and awakening the Governments of Europe to the\r\nforce which this placed in their hands. For the first time in history a\r\nmanifesto was addressed \"to the German nation.\" The contrast drawn in the\r\nArchduke's address to his army between the Spanish patriots dying in the\r\ndefence of their country, and the German vassal-contingents dragged by\r\nNapoleon into Spain to deprive a gallant nation of its freedom, was one of\r\nthe most just and the most telling that tyranny has ever given to the\r\nleaders of a righteous cause. [157] The Emperor's address \"to the German\r\nnation\" breathed the same spirit. It was not difficult for the politicians\r\nof the Rhenish Federation to ridicule the sudden enthusiasm for liberty and\r\nnationality shown by a Government which up to the present time had dreaded\r\nnothing so much as the excitement of popular movements; but, however\r\nunconcernedly the Emperor and the old school of Austrian statesmen might\r\nadopt patriotic phrases which they had no intention to remember when the\r\nstruggle was over, such language was a reality in the effect which it\r\nproduced upon the thousands who, both in Austria and other parts of\r\nGermany, now for the first time heard the summons to unite in defence of a\r\ncommon Fatherland.\r\n\r\n[Austrians invade Bavaria, April 9, 1809.]\r\n\r\n[Rising of the Tyrol, April, 1809.]\r\n\r\n[Its causes religious.]\r\n\r\nThe leading divisions of the Archduke's army crossed the Inn on the 9th of\r\nApril. Besides the forces intended for the invasion of Bavaria, which\r\nnumbered 170,000 men, the Austrian Government had formed two smaller\r\narmies, with which the Princes Ferdinand and John were to take up the\r\noffensive in the Grand Duchy of Warsaw and in Northern Italy. On every side\r\nAustria was first in the field; but even before its regular forces could\r\nencounter the enemy, a popular outbreak of the kind that the Government had\r\ninvoked wrested from the French the whole of an important province. While\r\nthe army crossed the Inn, the Tyrolese people rose, and overpowered the\r\nFrench and Bavarian detachments stationed in their country. The Tyrol had\r\nbeen taken from Austria at the Peace of Presburg, and attached to\r\nNapoleon's vassal kingdom of Bavaria. In geographical position and in\r\nrelationship of blood the Tyrolese were as closely connected with the\r\nBavarians as with the Austrians; and the annexation would probably have\r\ncaused no lasting discontent if the Bavarian Government had condescended to\r\ntake some account of the character of its new subjects. Under the rule of\r\nAustria the Tyrolese had enjoyed many privileges. They were exempt from\r\nmilitary service, except in their own militia; they paid few taxes; they\r\npossessed forms of self-government which were at least popular enough to be\r\nregretted after they had been lost. The people adored their bishops and\r\nclergy. Nowhere could the Church exhibit a more winning example of unbroken\r\naccord between a simple people and a Catholic Crown. Protestantism and the\r\nunholy activities of reason had never brought trouble into the land. The\r\npeople believed exactly what the priests told them, and delighted in the\r\ninnumerable holidays provided by the Church. They had so little cupidity\r\nthat no bribe could induce a Tyrolese peasant to inform the French of any\r\nmovement; they had so little intelligence that, when their own courage and\r\nstout-heartedness had won their first battle, they persuaded one another\r\nthat they had been led by a Saint on a white horse. Grievances of a\r\nsubstantial character were not wanting under the new Bavarian rule; but it\r\nwas less the increased taxation and the enforcement of military service\r\nthat exasperated the people than the attacks made by the Government upon\r\nthe property and rights of the Church. Montgelas, the reforming Bavarian\r\nminister, treated the Tyrolese bishops with as little ceremony as the\r\nSwabian knights. The State laid claim to all advowsons; and upon the\r\nrefusal of the bishops to give up their patronage, the bishops themselves\r\nwere banished and their revenues sequestrated. A passion for uniformity and\r\ncommon sense prompted the Government to revive the Emperor Joseph's edicts\r\nagainst pilgrimages and Church holidays. It became a police-offence to shut\r\nup a shop on a saint's day, or to wear a gay dress at a festival. Bavarian\r\nsoldiers closed the churches at the end of a prescribed number of masses.\r\nAt a sale of Church property, ordered by the Government, some of the sacred\r\nvessels were permitted to fall into the hands of the Jews.\r\n\r\nThese were the wrongs that fired the simple Tyrolese. They could have borne\r\nthe visits of the tax-gatherer and the lists of conscription; they could\r\nnot bear that their priests should be overruled, or that their observances\r\nshould be limited to those sufficient for ordinary Catholics. Yet, with all\r\nits aspect of unreason, the question in the Tyrol was also part of that\r\nlarger question whether Napoleon's pleasure should be the rule of European\r\nlife, or nations should have some voice in the disposal of their own\r\naffairs. The Tyrolese were not more superstitious, and they were certainty\r\nmuch less cruel, than the Spaniards. They fought for ecclesiastical\r\nabsurdities; but their cause was also the cause of national right, and the\r\nadmiration which their courage excited in Europe was well deserved.\r\n\r\n[Tyrolese expel Bavarians and French, April 1809.]\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1809 the Archduke John had met the leaders of the\r\nTyrolese peasantry, and planned the first movements of a national\r\ninsurrection. As soon as the Austrian army crossed the Inn, the peasants\r\nthronged to their appointed meeting-places. Scattered detachments of the\r\nBavarians were surrounded, and on the 12th of April the main body of the\r\nTyrolese, numbering about 15,000 men, advanced upon Innsbruck. The town was\r\ninvested; the Bavarian garrison, consisting of 3,000 regular troops, found\r\nitself forced to surrender after a severe engagement. On the next morning a\r\nFrench column, on the march from Italy to the Danube, approached Innsbruck,\r\ntotally unaware of the events of the preceding day. The Tyrolese closed\r\nbehind it as it advanced. It was not until the column was close to the town\r\nthat its commander, General Brisson, discovered that Innsbruck had fallen\r\ninto an enemy's hands. Retreat was impossible; ammunition was wanting for a\r\nbattle; and Brisson had no choice but to surrender to the peasants, who had\r\nalready proved more than a match for the Bavarian regular troops. The\r\nTyrolese had done their work without the help of a single Austrian\r\nregiment. In five days the weak fabric of Bavarian rule had been thrown to\r\nthe ground. The French only maintained themselves in the lower valley of\r\nthe Adige: and before the end of April their last positions at Trent and\r\nRoveredo were evacuated, and no foreign soldier remained on Tyrolese soil.\r\n\r\n[Campaign of Archduke Charles in Bavaria.]\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Austrian commanders upon the Inn formed a melancholy\r\ncontrast to the activity of the mountaineers. In spite of the delay of\r\nthree weeks in opening the campaign, Davoust had still not effected his\r\njunction with the French troops in Southern Bavaria, and a rapid movement\r\nof the Austrians might even now have overwhelmed his isolated divisions at\r\nRatisbon. Napoleon himself had remained in Paris till the last moment,\r\ninstructing Berthier, the chief of the staff, to concentrate the vanguard\r\nat Ratisbon, if by the 15th of April the enemy had not crossed the Inn, but\r\nto draw back to the line of the Lech if the enemy crossed the Inn before\r\nthat day. [158] The Archduke entered Bavaria on the 9th; but, instead of\r\nretiring to the Lech, Berthier allowed the army to be scattered over an\r\narea sixty miles broad, from Ratisbon to points above Augsburg. Davoust lay\r\nat Ratisbon, a certain prey if the Archduke pushed forwards with vigour and\r\nthrust his army between the northern and the southern positions of the\r\nFrench. But nothing could change the sluggishness of the Austrian march.\r\nThe Archduke was six days in moving from the Inn to the Isar; and before\r\nthe order was given for an advance upon Ratisbon, Napoleon himself had\r\narrived at Donauwörth, and taken the command out of the hands of his feeble\r\nlieutenant.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon restores superiority of French, April 18, 19.]\r\n\r\nIt needed all the Emperor's energy to snatch victory from the enemy's\r\ngrasp. Davoust was bidden to fall back from Ratisbon to Neustadt; the most\r\npressing orders were sent to Massena, who commanded the right at Augsburg,\r\nto push forward to the north-east in the direction of his colleague, before\r\nthe Austrians could throw the mass of their forces upon Davoust's weak\r\ncorps. Both generals understood the urgency of the command. Davoust set out\r\nfrom Ratisbon on the morning of the 19th. He was attacked by the Archduke,\r\nbut so feebly and irresolutely that, with all their superiority in numbers,\r\nthe Austrians failed to overpower the enemy at any one point. Massena,\r\nimmediately after receiving his orders, hurried from Augsburg\r\nnorth-eastwards, while Napoleon himself advanced into the mid-space between\r\nthe two generals, and brought the right and left wings of the French army\r\ninto communication with one another. In two days after the Emperor's\r\narrival all the advantages of the Austrians were gone: the French, so\r\nlately exposed to destruction, formed a concentrated mass in the presence\r\nof a scattered enemy. The issue of the campaign was decided by the\r\nmovements of these two days. Napoleon was again at the head of 150,000 men;\r\nthe Archduke, already baulked in his first attack upon Davoust, was seized\r\nwith unworthy terror when he found that Napoleon himself was before him,\r\nand resigned himself to anticipations of ruin.\r\n\r\n[Austrian defeats at Landshut and Eggmühl, April 22.]\r\n\r\n[French enter Vienna, May 13.]\r\n\r\nA series of manoeuvres and engagements in the finest style of Napoleonic\r\nwarfare filled the next three days with French victories and Austrian\r\ndisasters. On April the 20th the long line of the Archduke's army was cut\r\nin halves by an attack at Abensberg. The left was driven across the Isar at\r\nLandshut; the right, commanded by the Archduke himself, was overpowered at\r\nEggmühl on the 22nd, and forced northwards. The unbroken mass of the French\r\narmy now thrust itself between the two defeated wings of the enemy. The\r\nonly road remaining open to the Archduke was that through Ratisbon to the\r\nnorth of the Danube. In five days, although no engagement of the first\r\norder had taken place between the French and Austrian armies, Charles had\r\nlost 60,000 men; the mass of his army was retreating into Bohemia, and the\r\nroad to Vienna lay scarcely less open than after Mack's capitulation at Ulm\r\nfour years before. A desperate battle fought against the advancing French\r\nat Edelsberg by the weak divisions that had remained on the south of the\r\nDanube, proved that the disasters of the campaign were due to the faults of\r\nthe general, not to the men whom he commanded. But whatever hopes of\r\nultimate success might still be based on the gallant temper of the army, it\r\nwas impossible to prevent the fall of the capital. The French, leaving the\r\nArchduke on the north of the Danube, pressed forwards along the direct\r\nroute from the Inn to Vienna. The capital was bombarded and occupied. On\r\nthe 13th of May Napoleon again took up his quarters in the palace of the\r\nAustrian monarchs where he had signed the Peace of 1806. The divisions\r\nwhich had fallen back before him along the southern road crossed the Danube\r\nat Vienna, and joined the Archduke on the bank of the river opposite the\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\n[Attempts of Dörnberg and Schill in Northern Germany, April, 1809.]\r\n\r\nThe disasters of the Bavarian campaign involved the sacrifice of all that\r\nhad resulted from Austrian victories elsewhere, and of all that might have\r\nbeen won by a general insurrection in Northern Germany. In Poland and in\r\nItaly the war had opened favourably for Austria. Warsaw had been seized;\r\nEugene Beauharnais, the Viceroy of Italy, had been defeated by the Archduke\r\nJohn at Sacile, in Venetia; but it was impossible to pursue these\r\nadvantages when the capital itself was on the point of falling into the\r\nhands of the enemy. The invading armies halted, and ere long the Archduke\r\nJohn commenced his retreat into the mountains. In Northern Germany no\r\npopular uprising could be expected when once Austria had been defeated. The\r\nonly movements that took place were undertaken by soldiers, and undertaken\r\nbefore the disasters in Bavaria became known. The leaders in this military\r\nconspiracy were Dörnberg, an officer in the service of King Jerome of\r\nWestphalia, and Schill, the Prussian cavalry leader who had so brilliantly\r\ndistinguished himself in the defence of Colberg. Dörnberg had taken service\r\nunder Jerome with the design of raising Jerome's own army against him. It\r\nhad been agreed by the conspirators that at the same moment Dörnberg should\r\nraise the Hessian standard in Westphalia, and Schill, marching from Berlin\r\nwith any part of the Prussian army that would follow him, should proclaim\r\nwar against the French in defiance of the Prussian Government. Dörnberg had\r\nmade sure of the support of his own regiment; but at the last moment the\r\nplot was discovered, and he was transferred to the command of a body of men\r\nupon whom he could not rely. He placed himself at the head of a band of\r\npeasants, and raised the standard of insurrection. King Jerome's troops met\r\nthe solicitations of their countrymen with a volley of bullets. Dörnberg\r\nfled for his life; and the revolt ended on the day after it had begun\r\n(April 23). Schill, unconscious of Dörnberg's ruin, and deceived by reports\r\nof Austrian victories upon the Danube, led out his regiment from Berlin as\r\nif for a day's manoeuvring, and then summoned his men to follow him in\r\nraising a national insurrection against Napoleon. The soldiers answered\r\nSchill's eloquent words with shouts of applause; the march was continued\r\nwestwards, and Schill crossed the Elbe, intending to fall upon the\r\ncommunications of Napoleon's army, already, as he believed, staggering\r\nunder the blows delivered by the Archduke in the valley of the Danube.\r\n\r\n[Schill at Stralsund, May 23.]\r\n\r\nOn reaching Halle, Schill learnt of the overthrow of the Archduke and of\r\nDörnberg's ruin in Westphalia. All hope of success in the enterprise on\r\nwhich he had quitted Berlin was dashed to the ground. The possibility of\r\nraising a popular insurrection vanished. Schill, however, had gone too far\r\nto recede; and even now it was not too late to join the armies of\r\nNapoleon's enemies. Schill might move into Bohemia, or to some point on the\r\nnorthern coast where he would be within reach of English vessels. But in\r\nany case quick and steady decision was necessary; and this Schill could not\r\nattain. Though brave even to recklessness, and gifted with qualities which\r\nmade him the idol of the public, Schill lacked the disinterestedness and\r\nself-mastery which calm the judgment in time of trial. The sudden ruin of\r\nhis hopes left him without a plan. He wasted day after day in purposeless\r\nmarches, while the enemy collected a force to overwhelm him. His influence\r\nover his men became impaired; the denunciations of the Prussian Government\r\nprevented other soldiers from joining him. At length Schill determined to\r\nrecross the Elbe, and to throw himself into the coast town of Stralsund, in\r\nSwedish Pomerania. He marched through Mecklenburg, and suddenly appeared\r\nbefore Stralsund at moment when the French cannoneers in garrison were\r\nfiring a salvo in honour of Napoleon's entry into Vienna. A hand-to-hand\r\nfight gave Schill possession of the town, with all its stores. For a moment\r\nit seemed as if Stralsund might become a second Saragossa; but the French\r\nwere at hand before it was possible to create works of defence. Schill had\r\nbut eighteen hundred men, half of whom were cavalry; he understood nothing\r\nof military science, and would listen to no counsels. A week after his\r\nentry into Stralsund the town was stormed by a force four times more\r\nnumerous than its defenders. Capitulation was no word for the man who had\r\ndared to make a private war upon Napoleon; Schill could only set the\r\nexample of an heroic death. [159] The officers who were not so fortunate as\r\nto fall with their leader were shot in cold blood, after trial by a French\r\ncourt-martial. Six hundred common soldiers who surrendered were sent to the\r\ngalleys of Toulon to sicken among French thieves and murderers. The cruelty\r\nof the conqueror, the heroism of the conquered, gave to Schill's\r\nill-planned venture the importance of a great act of patriotic martyrdom.\r\nAnother example had been given of self-sacrifice in the just cause.\r\nSchill's faults were forgotten; his memory deepened the passion with which\r\nall the braver spirits of Germany now looked for the day of reckoning with\r\ntheir oppressor. [160]\r\n\r\n[Napoleon crosses the Danube, May 20.]\r\n\r\n[Battle of Aspern, May 21, 22.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon had finished the first act of the war of 1809 by the occupation of\r\nVienna; but no peace was possible until the Austrian army, which lay upon\r\nthe opposite bank of the river, had been attacked and beaten. Four miles\r\nbelow Vienna the Danube is divided into two streams by the island of Lobau:\r\nthe southern stream is the main channel of the river, the northern is only\r\na hundred and fifty yards broad. It was here that Napoleon determined to\r\nmake the passage. The broad arm of the Danube, sheltered by the island from\r\nthe enemy's fire, was easily bridged by boats; the passage from the island\r\nto the northern bank, though liable to be disputed by the Austrians, was\r\nfacilitated by the narrowing of the stream. On the 18th of May, Napoleon,\r\nsupposing himself to have made good the connection between the island and\r\nthe southern bank, began to bridge the northern arm of the river. His\r\nmovements were observed by the enemy, but no opposition was offered. On the\r\n20th a body of 40,000 French crossed to the northern bank, and occupied the\r\nvillages of Aspern and Essling. This was the movement for which the\r\nArchduke Charles, who had now 80,000 men under arms, had been waiting.\r\nEarly on the 21st a mass of heavily-laden barges was let loose by the\r\nAustrians above the island. The waters of the Danube were swollen by the\r\nmelting of the snows, and at midday the bridges of the French over the\r\nbroad arm of the river were swept away. A little later, dense Austrian\r\ncolumns were seen advancing upon the villages of Aspern and Essling, where\r\nthe French, cut off from their supports, had to meet an overpowering enemy\r\nin front, with an impassable river in their rear. The attack began at four\r\nin the afternoon; when night fell the French had been driven out of Aspern,\r\nthough they still held the Austrians at bay in their other position at\r\nEssling. During the night the long bridges were repaired; forty thousand\r\nadditional troops moved across the island to the northern bank of the\r\nDanube; and the engagement was renewed, now between equal numbers, on the\r\nfollowing morning. Five times the village of Aspern was lost and won. In\r\nthe midst of the struggle the long bridges were again carried away. Unable\r\nto break the enemy, unable to bring up any new forces from Vienna, Napoleon\r\nordered a retreat. The army was slowly withdrawn into the island of Lobau.\r\nThere for the next two days it lay without food and without ammunition,\r\nsevered from Vienna, and exposed to certain destruction if the Archduke\r\ncould have thrown his army across the narrow arm of the river and renewed\r\nthe engagement. But the Austrians were in no condition to follow up their\r\nvictory. Their losses were enormous; their stores were exhausted. The\r\nmoments in which a single stroke might have overthrown the whole fabric of\r\nNapoleon's power were spent in forced inaction. By the third day after the\r\nbattle of Aspern the communications between the island and the mainland\r\nwere restored, and Napoleon's energy had brought the army out of immediate\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n[Effect on Europe.]\r\n\r\n[Brunswick invades Saxony.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, although the worst was averted, and the French now lay secure\r\nin their island fortress, the defeat of Aspern changed the position of\r\nNapoleon in the eyes of all Europe. The belief in his invincibility was\r\ndestroyed; he had suffered a defeat in person, at the head of his finest\r\ntroops, from an enemy little superior in strength to himself. The disasters\r\nof the Austrians in the opening of the campaign were forgotten; everywhere\r\nthe hopes of resistance woke into new life. Prussian statesmen urged their\r\nKing to promise his support if Austria should gain one more victory. Other\r\nenemies were ready to fall upon Napoleon without waiting for this\r\ncondition. England collected an immense armament destined for an attack\r\nupon some point of the northern coast. Germany, lately mute and nerveless,\r\ngave threatening signs. The Duke of Brunswick, driven from his inheritance\r\nafter his father's death at Jena, invaded the dominions of Napoleon's\r\nvassal, the King of Saxony, and expelled him from his capital. Popular\r\ninsurrections broke out in Würtemberg and in Westphalia, and proved the\r\nrising force of national feeling even in districts where the cause of\r\nGermany lately seemed so hopelessly lost.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon's preparations for the second passage of the Danube, June.]\r\n\r\n[French cross the Danube, July 4.]\r\n\r\nBut Napoleon concerned himself little with these remoter enemies. Every\r\nenergy of his mind was bent to the one great issue on which victory\r\ndepended, the passage of the Danube. His chances of success were still\r\ngood, if the French troops watching the enemy between Vienna and the\r\nAdriatic could be brought up in time for the final struggle. The Archduke\r\nCharles was in no hurry for a battle, believing that every hour increased\r\nthe probability of an attack upon Napoleon by England or Prussia, or\r\ninsurgent Germany. Never was the difference between Napoleon and his ablest\r\nadversaries more strikingly displayed than in the work which was\r\naccomplished by him during this same interval. He had determined that in\r\nthe next battle his army should march across the Danube as safely and as\r\nrapidly as it could march along the streets of Vienna. Two solid bridges\r\nwere built on piles across the broad arm of the river; no less than six\r\nbridges of rafts were made ready to be thrown across the narrow arm when\r\nthe moment arrived for the attack. By the end of June all the outlying\r\ndivisions of the French army had gathered to the great rallying-point; a\r\nhundred and eighty thousand men were in the island, or ready to enter it;\r\nevery movement, every position to be occupied by each member of this vast\r\nmass in its passage and advance, was fixed down to the minutest details.\r\nNapoleon had decided to cross from the eastern, not from the northern side\r\nof the island, and thus to pass outside the fortifications which the\r\nArchduke had erected on the former battle-field. Towards midnight on the 4th\r\nof July, in the midst of a violent storm, the six bridges were successively\r\nswung across the river. The artillery opened fire. One army corps after\r\nanother, each drawn up opposite to its own bridge, marched to the northern\r\nshore, and by sunrise nearly the whole of Napoleon's force deployed on the\r\nleft bank of the Danube. The river had been converted into a great highway;\r\nthe fortifications which had been erected by the Archduke were turned by\r\nthe eastward direction of the passage. All that remained for the Austrian\r\ncommander was to fight a pitched battle on ground that was now at least\r\nthoroughly familiar to him. Charles had taken up a good position on the\r\nhills that look over the village of Wagram. Here, with 130,000 men, he\r\nawaited the attack of the French. The first attack was made in the\r\nafternoon after the crossing of the river. It failed; and the French army\r\nlay stretched during the night between the river and the hills, while the\r\nArchduke prepared to descend upon their left on the morrow, and to force\r\nhimself between the enemy and the bridges behind them.\r\n\r\n[Battle of Wagram, July 5, 6.]\r\n\r\n[Armistice of Znaim, July 12.]\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the 6th the two largest armies that had ever been\r\nbrought face to face in Europe began their onslaught. Spectators from the\r\nsteeples of Vienna saw the fire of the French little by little receding on\r\ntheir left, and dense masses of the Austrians pressing on towards the\r\nbridges, on whose safety the existence of the French army depended. But ere\r\nlong the forward movement stopped. Napoleon had thrown an overpowering\r\nforce against the Austrian centre, and the Archduke found himself compelled\r\nto recall his victorious divisions and defend his own threatened line.\r\nGradually the superior numbers of the French forced the enemy back. The\r\nArchduke John, who had been ordered up from Presburg, failed to appear on\r\nthe field; and at two o'clock Charles ordered a retreat. The order of the\r\nAustrians was unbroken; they had captured more prisoners than they had\r\nlost; their retreat was covered by so powerful an artillery that the French\r\ncould make no pursuit. The victory was no doubt Napoleon's, but it was a\r\nvictory that had nothing in common with Jena and Austerlitz. Nothing was\r\nlost by the Austrians at Wagram but their positions and the reputation of\r\ntheir general. The army was still in fighting-order, with the fortresses of\r\nBohemia behind it. Whether Austria would continue the war depended on the\r\naction of the other European Powers. If Great Britain successfully landed\r\nan armament in Northern Germany or dealt any overwhelming blow in Spain, if\r\nPrussia declared war on Napoleon, Austria might fight on. If the other\r\nPowers failed, Austria, must make peace. The armistice of Znaim, concluded\r\non the 12th of July, was recognised on all sides as a mere device to gain\r\ntime. There was a pause in the great struggle in the central Continent. Its\r\nrenewal or its termination depended upon the issue of events at a distance.\r\n\r\n[Wellesley invades Spain, June, 1809.]\r\n\r\n[Talavera, July 27.]\r\n\r\n[Wellesley retreats to Portugal.]\r\n\r\nFor the moment the eyes of all Europe were fixed upon the British army in\r\nSpain. Sir Arthur Wellesley, who took command at Lisbon in the spring, had\r\ndriven Soult out of Oporto, and was advancing by the valley of the Tagus\r\nupon the Spanish capital. Some appearance of additional strength was given\r\nto him by the support of a Spanish army under the command of General\r\nCuesta. Wellesley's march had, however, been delayed by the neglect and bad\r\nfaith of the Spanish Government, and time had been given to Soult to\r\ncollect a large force in the neighbourhood of Salamanca, ready either to\r\nfall upon Wellesley from the north, or to unite with another French army\r\nwhich lay at Talavera, if its commander, Victor, had the wisdom to postpone\r\nan engagement. The English general knew nothing of Soult's presence on his\r\nflank: he continued his march towards Madrid along the valley of the Tagus,\r\nand finally drew up for battle at Talavera, when Victor, after retreating\r\nbefore Cuesta to some distance, hunted back his Spanish pursuer to the\r\npoint from which he had started. [161] The first attack was made by Victor\r\nupon the English positions at evening on the 27th of July. Next morning the\r\nassault was renewed, and the battle became general. Wellesley gained a\r\ncomplete victory, but the English themselves suffered heavily, and the army\r\nremained in its position. Within the next few days Soult was discovered to\r\nbe descending from the mountains between Salamanca and the Tagus. A force\r\nsuperior to Wellesley's own threatened to close upon him from the rear, and\r\nto hem him in between two fires. The sacrifices of Talavera proved to have\r\nbeen made in vain. Wellesley had no choice but to abandon his advance upon\r\nthe Spanish capital, and to fall back upon Portugal by the roads south of\r\nthe Tagus. In spite of the defeat of Victor, the French were the winners of\r\nthe campaign. Madrid was still secure; the fabric of French rule in the\r\nSpanish Peninsula was still unshaken. The tidings of Wellesley's retreat\r\nreached Napoleon and the Austrian negotiators, damping the hopes of\r\nAustria, and easing Napoleon's fears. Austria's continuance of the war now\r\ndepended upon the success or failure of the long-expected descent of an\r\nEnglish army upon the northern coast of Europe.\r\n\r\nThree months before the Austrian Government declared war upon Napoleon, it\r\nhad acquainted Great Britain with its own plans, and urged the Cabinet to\r\ndispatch an English force to Northern Germany. Such a force, landing at the\r\ntime of the battle of Aspern, would certainly have aroused both Prussia and\r\nthe country between the Elbe and the Maine. But the difference between a\r\nmovement executed in time and one executed weeks and months too late was\r\nstill unknown at the English War Office. The Ministry did not even begin\r\ntheir preparations till the middle of June, and then they determined, in\r\npursuance of a plan made some years earlier, to attack the French fleet and\r\ndocks at Antwerp, and to ignore that patriotic movement in Northern Germany\r\nfrom which they had so much to hope.\r\n\r\n[British Expedition against Antwerp, July, 1809.]\r\n\r\n[Total failure.]\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of July, two months after the battle of Aspern and three weeks\r\nafter the battle of Wagram, a fleet of thirty-seven ships of the line, with\r\ninnumerable transports and gunboats, set sail from Dover for the Schelde.\r\nForty thousand troops were on board; the commander of the expedition was\r\nthe Earl of Chatham, a court-favourite in whom Nature avenged herself upon\r\nGreat Britain for what she had given to this country in his father and his\r\nyounger brother. The troops were landed on the island of Walcheren. Instead\r\nof pushing forward to Antwerp with all possible haste, and surprising it\r\nbefore any preparations could be made for its defence, Lord Chatham placed\r\nhalf his army on the banks of various canals, and with the other half\r\nproceeded to invest Flushing. On the 16th of August this unfortunate town\r\nsurrendered, after a bombardment that had reduced it to a mass of ruins.\r\nDuring the next ten days the English commander advanced about as many\r\nmiles, and then discovered that for all prospect of taking Antwerp he might\r\nas well have remained in England. Whilst Chatham was groping about in\r\nWalcheren, the fortifications of Antwerp were restored, the fleet carried\r\nup the river, and a mass of troops collected sufficient to defend the town\r\nagainst a regular siege. Defeat stared the English in the face. At the end\r\nof August the general recommended the Government to recall the expedition,\r\nonly leaving a force of 15,000 soldiers to occupy the marshes of Walcheren.\r\nChatham's recommendations were accepted; and on a spot so notoriously\r\npestiferous that Napoleon had refused to permit a single French soldier to\r\nserve there on garrison duty, [162] an English army-corps, which might at\r\nleast have earned the same honour as Schill and Brunswick in Northern\r\nGermany, was left to perish of fever and ague. When two thousand soldiers\r\nwere in their graves, the rest were recalled to England.\r\n\r\n[Austria makes peace.]\r\n\r\nGreat Britain had failed to weaken or to alarm Napoleon; the King of\r\nPrussia made no movement on behalf of the losing cause; and the Austrian\r\nGovernment unwillingly found itself compelled to accept conditions of\r\npeace. It was not so much a deficiency in its forces as the universal\r\ndistrust of its generals that made it impossible for Austria to continue\r\nthe war. The soldiers had fought as bravely as the French, but in vain. \"If\r\nwe had a million soldiers,\" it was said, \"we must make peace; for we have\r\nno one to command them.\" Count Stadion, who was for carrying on the war to\r\nthe bitter end, despaired of throwing his own energetic courage into the\r\nmen who surrounded the Emperor, and withdrew from public affairs. For week\r\nafter week the Emperor fluctuated between the acceptance of Napoleon's hard\r\nconditions and the renewal of a struggle which was likely to involve his\r\nown dethronement as well as the total conquest of the Austrian State. At\r\nlength Napoleon's demands were presented in the form of an ultimatum. In\r\nhis distress the Emperor's thoughts turned towards the Minister who, eight\r\nyears before, had been so strong, so resolute, when all around him wavered.\r\nThugut, now seventy-six years old, was living in retirement. The Emperor\r\nsent one of his generals to ask his opinion on peace or war. \"I thought to\r\nfind him,\" reported the general, \"broken in mind and body; but the fire of\r\nhis spirit is in its full force.\" Thugut's reply did honour to his\r\nforesight: \"Make peace at any price. The existence of the Austrian monarchy\r\nis at stake: the dissolution of the French Empire is not far off.\" On the\r\n14th of October the Emperor Francis accepted his conqueror's terms, and\r\nsigned conditions of peace. [163]\r\n\r\n[Peace of Vienna, Oct. 14, 1809.]\r\n\r\n[Real effects of the war of 1809.]\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Vienna, the last which Napoleon signed as a conqueror, took\r\nfrom the Austrian Empire 50,000 square miles of territory and more than\r\n4,000,000 inhabitants. Salzburg, with part of Upper Austria, was ceded to\r\nBavaria; Western Galicia, the territory gained by Austria in the final\r\npartition of Poland, was transferred to the Grand-Duchy of Warsaw; part of\r\nCarinthia, with the whole of the country lying between the Adriatic and the\r\nSave as far as the frontier of Bosnia, was annexed to Napoleon's own\r\nEmpire, under the title of the Illyrian Provinces. Austria was cut off from\r\nthe sea, and the dominion of Napoleon extended without a break to the\r\nborders of Turkey. Bavaria and Saxony, the outposts of French sovereignty\r\nin Central Europe, were enriched at the expense of the Power which had\r\ncalled Germany to arms; Austria, which at the beginning of the\r\nRevolutionary War had owned territory upon the Rhine and exercised a\r\npredominating influence over all Italy, seemed now to be finally excluded\r\nboth from Germany and the Mediterranean. Yet, however striking the change\r\nof frontier which gave to Napoleon continuous dominion from the Straits of\r\nCalais to the border of Bosnia, the victories of France in 1809 brought in\r\ntheir train none of those great moral changes which had hitherto made each\r\nFrench conquest a stage in European progress. The campaign of 1796 had\r\naroused the hope of national independence in Italy; the settlements of 1801\r\nand 1806 had put an end to Feudalism in Western Germany; the victories of\r\n1809 originated nothing but a change of frontier such as the next war might\r\nobliterate and undo. All that was permanent in the effects of the year 1809\r\nwas due, not to any new creations of Napoleon, but to the spirit of\r\nresistance which France had at length excited in Europe. The revolt of the\r\nTyrol, the exploits of Brunswick and Schill, gave a stimulus to German\r\npatriotism which survived the defeat of Austria. Austria itself, though\r\noverpowered, had inflicted a deadly injury upon Napoleon, by withdrawing\r\nhim from Spain at the moment when he might have completed its conquest, and\r\nby enabling Wellesley to gain a footing in the Peninsula. Napoleon appeared\r\nto have gathered a richer spoil from the victories of 1809 than from any of\r\nhis previous wars; in reality he had never surrounded himself with so many\r\ndangers. Russia was alienated by the annexation of West Galicia to the\r\nPolish Grand Duchy of Warsaw; Northern Germany had profited by the examples\r\nof courage and patriotism shown so largely in 1809 on behalf of the\r\nFatherland; Spain, supported by Wellesley's army, was still far from\r\nsubmission. The old indifference which had smoothed the way for the earlier\r\nFrench conquests was no longer the characteristic of Europe. The\r\nestrangement of Russia, the growth of national spirit in Germany and in\r\nSpain, involved a danger to Napoleon's power which far outweighed the\r\nvisible results of his victory.\r\n\r\n[Austria and the Tyrol.]\r\n\r\nAustria itself could only acquiesce in defeat: nor perhaps would the\r\npermanent interests of Europe have been promoted by its success. The\r\nchampionship of Germany which it assumed at the beginning of the war would\r\nno doubt have resulted in the temporary establishment of some form of\r\nGerman union under Austrian leadership, if the event of the war had been\r\ndifferent; but the sovereign of Hungary and Croatia could never be the true\r\nhead of the German people; and the conduct of the Austrian Government after\r\nthe peace of 1809 gave little reason to regret its failure to revive a\r\nTeutonic Empire. No portion of the Emperor's subjects had fought for him\r\nwith such determined loyalty as the Tyrolese. After having been the first\r\nto throw off the yoke of the stranger, they had again and again freed their\r\ncountry when Napoleon's generals supposed all resistance overcome; and in\r\nreturn for their efforts the Emperor had solemnly assured them that he\r\nwould never accept a peace which did not restore them to his Empire. If\r\nfair dealing was due anywhere it was due from the Court of Austria to the\r\nTyrolese. Yet the only reward of the simple courage of these mountaineers\r\nwas that the war-party at head-quarters recklessly employed them as a means\r\nof prolonging, hostilities after the armistice of Znaim, and that up to the\r\nmoment when peace was signed they were left in the belief that the Emperor\r\nmeant to keep his promise, Austria, however, could not ruin herself to\r\nplease the Tyrolese. Circumstances were changed; and the phrases of\r\npatriotism which had excited so much rejoicing at the beginning of the war\r\nwere now fallen out of fashion at Vienna. Nothing more was heard about the\r\nrights of nations and the deliverance of Germany. Austria had made a great\r\nventure and failed; and the Government rather resumed than abandoned its\r\nnormal attitude in turning its back upon the professions of 1809.\r\n\r\n[Austrian policy after 1809.]\r\n\r\n[Metternich.]\r\n\r\nHenceforward the policy of Austria was one of calculation, untinged by\r\nnational sympathies. France had been a cruel enemy; yet if there was a\r\nprospect of winning something for Austria by a French alliance,\r\nconsiderations of sentiment could not be allowed to stand in the way. A\r\nstatesman who, like Count Stadion, had identified the interests of Austria\r\nwith the liberation of Germany, was no fitting helmsman for the State in\r\nthe shifting course that now lay before it. A diplomatist was called to\r\npower who had hitherto by Napoleon's own desire represented the Austrian\r\nState at Paris. Count Metternich, the new Chief Minister, was the son of a\r\nRhenish nobleman who had held high office under the Austrian crown. His\r\nyouth had been passed at Coblentz, and his character and tastes were those\r\nwhich in the eighteenth century had marked the court-circles of the little\r\nRhenish Principalities, French in their outer life, unconscious of the\r\ninstinct of nationality, polished and seductive in that personal management\r\nwhich passed for the highest type of statesmanship. Metternich had been\r\nambassador at Dresden and at Berlin before he went to Paris. Napoleon had\r\nrequested that he might be transferred to the Court of the Tuileries, on\r\naccount of the marked personal courtesy shown by Metternich to the French\r\nambassador at Berlin during the war between France and Austria in 1805.\r\nMetternich carried with him all the friendliness of personal intercourse\r\nwhich Napoleon expected in him, but he also carried with him a calm and\r\npenetrating self-possession, and the conviction that Napoleon would give\r\nEurope no rest until his power was greatly diminished. He served Austria\r\nwell at Paris, and in the negotiations for peace which followed the battle\r\nof Wagram he took a leading part. After the disasters of 1809, when war was\r\nimpossible and isolation ruin, no statesman could so well serve Austria as\r\none who had never confessed himself the enemy of any Power; and, with the\r\nfull approval of Napoleon, the late Ambassador at Paris was placed at the\r\nhead of the Austrian State.\r\n\r\n[Marriage of Napoleon with Marie Louise, 1810.]\r\n\r\n[Severance of Napoleon and Alexander.]\r\n\r\nMetternich's first undertaking gave singular evidence of the flexibility of\r\nsystem which was henceforward to guard Austria's interests. Before the\r\ngrass had grown over the graves at Wagram, the Emperor Francis was\r\npersuaded to give his daughter in marriage to Napoleon. For some time past\r\nNapoleon had determined on divorcing Josephine and allying himself to one\r\nof the reigning houses of the Continent. His first advances were made at\r\nSt. Petersburg; but the Czar hesitated to form a connection which his\r\nsubjects would view as a dishonour; and the opportunity was seized by the\r\nless fastidious Austrians as soon as the fancies of the imperial suitor\r\nturned towards Vienna. The Emperor Francis, who had been bullied by\r\nNapoleon upon the field of Austerlitz, ridiculed and insulted in every\r\nproclamation issued during the late campaign, gave up his daughter for what\r\nwas called the good of his people, and reconciled himself to a son-in-law\r\nwho had taken so many provinces for his dowry. Peace had not been\r\nproclaimed four months when the treaty was signed which united the House of\r\nBonaparte to the family of Marie Antoinette. The Archduke Charles\r\nrepresented Napoleon in the espousals; the Archbishop of Vienna anointed\r\nthe bride with the same sacred oil with which he had consecrated the\r\nbanners of 1809; the servile press which narrated the wedding festivities\r\nfound no space to mention that the Emperor's bravest subject, the Tyrolese\r\nleader Hofer, was executed by Napoleon as a brigand in the interval between\r\nthe contract and the celebration of the marriage. Old Austrian families,\r\nmembers of the only aristocracy upon the Continent that still possessed\r\npolitical weight and a political tradition, lamented the Emperor's consent\r\nto a union which their prejudices called a mis-alliance, and their\r\nconsciences an adultery; but the object of Metternich was attained. The\r\nfriendship between France and Russia, which had inflicted so much evil on\r\nthe Continent since the Peace of Tilsit, was dissolved; the sword of\r\nNapoleon was turned away from Austria for at least some years; the\r\nrestoration of the lost provinces of the Hapsburg seemed not impossible,\r\nnow that Napoleon and Alexander were left face to face in Europe, and the\r\nalliance of Austria had become so important to the power which had hitherto\r\nenriched itself at Austria's expense.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon annexes Papal States, May, 1809.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon crowned his new bride, and felt himself at length the equal of the\r\nHapsburgs and the Bourbons. Except in Spain, his arms were no longer\r\nresisted upon the Continent, and the period immediately succeeding the\r\nPeace of Vienna was that which brought the Napoleonic Empire to its widest\r\nbounds. Already, in the pride of the first victories of 1809, Napoleon had\r\ncompleted his aggressions upon the Papal sovereignty by declaring the\r\nEcclesiastical States to be united to the French Empire (May 17, 1809). The\r\nPope retorted upon his despoiler with a Bull of Excommunication; but the\r\nspiritual terrors were among the least formidable of those then active in\r\nEurope, and the sanctity of the Pontiff did not prevent Napoleon's soldiers\r\nfrom arresting him in the Quirinal, and carrying him as a prisoner to\r\nSavona. Here Pius VII., was detained for the next three years. The Roman\r\nStates received the laws and the civil organisation of France. [164]\r\nBishops and clergy who refused the oath of fidelity to Napoleon were\r\nimprisoned or exiled; the monasteries and convents were dissolved; the\r\ncardinals and great officers, along with the archives and the whole\r\napparatus of ecclesiastical rule, were carried to Paris. In relation to the\r\nfuture of European Catholicism, the breach between Napoleon and Pius VII.,\r\nwas a more important event than was understood at the time; its immediate\r\nand visible result was that there was one sovereign the fewer in Europe,\r\nand one more province opened to the French conscription.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon annexes, Holland, July, 1810.]\r\n\r\nThe next of Napoleon's vassals who lost his throne was the King of Holland.\r\nLike Joseph in Spain, and like Murat in Naples, Louis Bonaparte had made an\r\nhonest effort to govern for the benefit of his subjects. He had endeavoured\r\nto lighten the burdens which Napoleon laid upon the Dutch nation, already\r\ndeprived of its colonies, its commerce, and its independence; and every\r\nplea which Louis had made for his subjects had been treated by Napoleon as\r\na breach of duty towards himself. The offence of the unfortunate King of\r\nHolland became unpardonable when he neglected to enforce the orders of\r\nNapoleon against the admission of English goods. Louis was summoned to\r\nParis, and compelled to sign a treaty, ceding part of his dominions and\r\nplacing his custom-houses in the hands of French officers. He returned to\r\nHolland, but affairs grew worse and worse. French troops overran the\r\ncountry; Napoleon's letters were each more menacing than the last; and at\r\nlength Louis fled from his dominions (July 1, 1810), and delivered himself\r\nfrom a royalty which had proved the most intolerable kind of servitude. A\r\nweek later Holland was incorporated with the French Empire.\r\n\r\n[Annexation of Le Valais, and of the North German coast.]\r\n\r\nTwo more annexations followed before the end of the year. The Republic of\r\nthe Valais was declared to have neglected the duty imposed upon it of\r\nrepairing the road over the Simplon, and forfeited its independence. The\r\nNorth German coast district, comprising the Hanse towns, Oldenburg, and\r\npart of the Kingdom of Westphalia, was annexed to the French Empire, with\r\nthe alleged object of more effectually shutting out British goods from the\r\nports of the Elbe and the Weser. Hamburg, however, and most of the\r\nterritory now incorporated with France, had been occupied by French troops\r\never since the war of 1806, and the legal change in its position scarcely\r\nmade its subjection more complete. Had the history of this annexation been\r\nwritten by men of the peasant-class, it would probably have been described\r\nin terms of unmixed thankfulness and praise. In the Decree introducing the\r\nFrench principle of the free tenure of land, thirty-six distinct forms of\r\nfeudal service are enumerated, as abolished without compensation. [165]\r\n\r\n[Extent of Napoleon's Empire and Dependencies, 1810.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon's dominion had now reached its widest bounds. The frontier of the\r\nEmpire began at Lübeck on the Baltic, touched the Rhine at Wesel, and\r\nfollowed the river and the Jura mountains to the foot of the Lake of\r\nGeneva; then, crossing the Alps above the source of the Rhone, it ran with\r\nthe rivers Sesia and Po to a point nearly opposite Mantua, mounted to the\r\nwatershed of the Apennines, and descended to the Mediterranean at\r\nTerracina. The late Ecclesiastical States were formed into the two\r\nDepartments of the Tiber and of Trasimene; Tuscany, also divided into\r\nFrench Departments, and represented in the French Legislative Body, gave\r\nthe title of Archduchess and the ceremonial of a Court to Napoleon's sister\r\nEliza; the Kingdom of Italy, formed by Lombardy, Venice, and the country\r\neast of the Apennines as far south as Ascoli, belonged to Napoleon himself,\r\nbut was not constitutionally united with the French Empire. On the east of\r\nthe Adriatic the Illyrian Provinces extended Napoleon's rule to the borders\r\nof Bosnia and Montenegro. Outside the frontier of this great Empire an\r\norder of feudatories ruled in Italy, in Germany, and in Poland. Murat, King\r\nof Naples, and the client-princes of the Confederation of the Rhine,\r\nholding all Germany up to the frontiers of Prussia and Austria, as well as\r\nthe Grand-Duchy of Warsaw, were nominally sovereigns within their own\r\ndominions; but they held their dignities at Napoleon's pleasure, and the\r\npopulation and revenues of their States were at his service.\r\n\r\n[Benefits of Napoleon's rule.]\r\n\r\n[Wrongs of Napoleon's rule.]\r\n\r\n[Commercial blockade.]\r\n\r\nThe close of the year 1810 saw the last changes effected which Europe was\r\ndestined to receive at the hands of Napoleon. The fabric of his sovereignty\r\nwas raised upon the ruins of all that was obsolete and forceless upon the\r\nwestern Continent; the benefits as well as the wrongs or his supremacy were\r\nnow seen in their widest operation. All Italy, the northern districts of\r\nGermany which were incorporated with the Empire, and a great part of the\r\nConfederate Territory of the Rhine, received in the Code Napoleon a law\r\nwhich, to an extent hitherto unknown in Europe, brought social justice into\r\nthe daily affairs of life. The privileges of the noble, the feudal burdens\r\nof the peasant, the monopolies of the guilds, passed away, in most\r\ninstances for ever. The comfort and improvement of mankind were vindicated\r\nas the true aim of property by the abolition of the devices which convert\r\nthe soil into an instrument of family pride, and by the enforcement of a\r\nfair division of inheritances among the children of the possessor. Legal\r\nprocess, both civil and criminal, was brought within the comprehension of\r\nordinary citizens, and submitted to the test of publicity. These were among\r\nthe fruits of an earlier enlightenment which Napoleon's supremacy bestowed\r\nupon a great part of Europe. The price which was paid for them was the\r\nsuppression of every vestige of liberty, the conscription, and the\r\nContinental blockade. On the whole, the yoke was patiently borne. The\r\nItalians and the Germans of the Rhenish Confederacy cared little what\r\nGovernment they obeyed; their recruits who were sent to be killed by the\r\nAustrians or the Spaniards felt it no especial hardship to fight Napoleon's\r\nbattles. More galling was the pressure of Napoleon's commercial system and\r\nof the agencies by which he attempted to enforce it. In the hope of ruining\r\nthe trade of Great Britain, Napoleon spared no severity against the owners\r\nof anything that had touched British hands, and deprived the Continent of\r\nits entire supply of colonial produce, with the exception of such as was\r\nimported at enormous charges by traders licensed by himself. The possession\r\nof English goods became a capital offence. In the great trading towns a\r\nsystem of permanent terrorism was put in force against the merchants.\r\nSoldiers ransacked their houses; their letters were opened; spies dogged\r\ntheir steps. It was in Hamburg, where Davoust exercised a sort of\r\nindependent sovereignty, that the violence and injustice of the Napoleonic\r\ncommercial system was seen in its most repulsive form; in the greater part\r\nof the Empire it was felt more in the general decline of trade and in a\r\nmultitude of annoying privations than in acts of obtrusive cruelty. [166]\r\nThe French were themselves compelled to extract sugar from beetroot, and to\r\nsubstitute chicory for coffee; the Germans, less favoured by nature, and\r\nless rapid in adaptation, thirsted and sulked. Even in such torpid\r\ncommunities as Saxony political discontent was at length engendered by\r\nbodily discomfort. Men who were proof against all the patriotic exaltation\r\nof Stein and Fichte felt that there must be something wrong in a system\r\nwhich sent up the price of coffee to five shillings a pound, and reduced\r\nthe tobacconist to exclusive dependence upon the market-gardener.\r\n\r\n[The Czar withdraws from Napoleon's commercial system, Dec., 1810.]\r\n\r\n[France and Russia preparing for war, 1811.]\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, by its effects upon Napoleon's German vassals that the\r\nContinental system contributed to the fall of its author. Whatever the\r\ndiscontent of these communities, they obeyed Napoleon as long as he was\r\nvictorious, and abandoned him only when his cause was lost. Its real\r\npolitical importance lay in the hostility which it excited between France\r\nand Russia. The Czar, who had attached himself to Napoleon's commercial\r\nsystem at the Peace of Tilsit, withdrew from it in the year succeeding the\r\nPeace of Vienna. The trade of the Russian Empire had been ruined by the\r\nclosure of its ports to British vessels and British goods. Napoleon had\r\nbroken his promise to Russia by adding West Galicia to the Polish Duchy of\r\nWarsaw; and the Czar refused to sacrifice the wealth of his subjects any\r\nlonger in the interest of an insincere ally. At the end of the year 1810 an\r\norder was published at St. Petersburg, opening the harbours of Russia to\r\nall ships bearing a neutral flag, and imposing a duty upon many of the\r\nproducts of France. This edict was scarcely less than a direct challenge to\r\nthe French Emperor. Napoleon exaggerated the effect of his Continental\r\nprohibitions upon English traffic. He imagined that the command of the\r\nEuropean coast-line, and nothing short of this, would enable him to exhaust\r\nhis enemy; and he was prepared to risk a war with Russia rather than permit\r\nit to frustrate his long-cherished hopes. Already in the Austrian marriage\r\nNapoleon had marked the severance of his interests from those of Alexander.\r\nAn attempted compromise upon the affairs of Poland produced only new\r\nalienation and distrust; an open affront was offered to Alexander in the\r\nannexation of the Duchy of Oldenburg, whose sovereign was a member of his\r\nown family. The last event was immediately followed by the publication of\r\nthe new Russian tariff. In the spring of 1811 Napoleon had determined upon\r\nwar. With Spain still unsubdued, he had no motive to hurry on hostilities;\r\nAlexander on his part was still less ready for action; and the forms of\r\ndiplomatic intercourse were in consequence maintained for some time longer\r\nat Paris and St. Petersburg. But the true nature of the situation was shown\r\nby the immense levies that were ordered both in France and Russia; and the\r\nrest of the year was spent in preparations for the campaign which was\r\ndestined to decide the fate of Europe.\r\n\r\n[Affairs in Spain and Portugal, 1809-1812.]\r\n\r\n[Lines of Torres Vedras, 1809-1810.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that during the period of more than two years that elapsed\r\nbetween the Peace of Vienna and the outbreak of war with Russia, Napoleon\r\nhad no enemy in arms upon the Continent except in the Spanish Peninsula.\r\nHad the Emperor himself taken up the command in Spain, he would probably\r\nwithin a few months have crushed both the Spanish armies and their English\r\nally. A fatal error in judgment made him willing to look on from a distance\r\nwhilst his generals engaged with this last foe. The disputes with the Pope\r\nand the King of Holland might well have been adjourned for another year;\r\nbut Napoleon felt no suspicions that the conquest of the Spanish Peninsula\r\nwas too difficult a task for his marshals; nor perhaps would it have been\r\nso if Wellington had been like any of the generals whom Napoleon had\r\nhimself encountered. The French forces in the Peninsula numbered over\r\n300,000 men: in spite of the victory of Talavera, the English had been\r\nforced to retreat into Portugal. But the warfare of Wellington was a\r\ndifferent thing from that even of the best Austrian or Russian commanders.\r\nFrom the time of the retreat from Talavera he had foreseen that Portugal\r\nwould be invaded by an army far outnumbering his own; and he planned a\r\nscheme of defence as original, as strongly marked with true military\r\ninsight, as Napoleon's own most daring schemes of attack. Behind Lisbon a\r\nrugged mountainous tract stretches from the Tagus to the sea: here, while\r\nthe English army wintered in the neighbourhood of Almeida, Wellington\r\nemployed thousands of Portuguese labourers in turning the promontory into\r\none vast fortress. No rumour of the operation was allowed to reach the\r\nenemy. A double series of fortifications, known as the Lines of Torres\r\nVedras, followed the mountain-bastion on the north of Lisbon, and left no\r\nsingle point open between the Tagus and the sea. This was the barrier to\r\nwhich Wellington meant in the last resort to draw his assailants, whilst\r\nthe country was swept of everything that might sustain an invading army,\r\nand the irregular troops of Portugal closed in upon its rear. [167]\r\n\r\n[Retreat of Massena, 1810-11.]\r\n\r\n[Massena's campaign against Wellington, 1810.]\r\n\r\nIn June, 1810, Marshal Massena, who had won the highest distinction at\r\nAspern and Wagram, arrived in Spain, and took up the command of the army\r\ndestined for the conquest of Portugal. Ciudad Rodrigo was invested:\r\nWellington, too weak to effect its relief, too wise to jeopardise his army\r\nfor the sake of Spanish praise, lay motionless while this great fortress\r\nfell into the hands of the invader. In September, the French, 70,000\r\nstrong, entered Portugal. Wellington retreated down the valley of the\r\nMondego, devastating the country. At length he halted at Busaco and gave\r\nbattle (September 27). The French were defeated; the victory gave the\r\nPortuguese full confidence in the English leader; but other roads were open\r\nto the invader, and Wellington continued his retreat. Massena followed, and\r\nheard for the first time of the fortifications of Torres Vedras when he was\r\nwithin five days' march of them. On nearing the mountain-barrier, Massena\r\nsearched in vain for an unprotected point. Fifty thousand English and\r\nPortuguese regular troops, besides a multitude of Portuguese militia, were\r\ncollected behind the lines; with the present number of the French an\r\nassault was hopeless. Massena waited for reinforcements. It was with the\r\nutmost difficulty that he could keep his army from starving; at length,\r\nwhen the country was utterly exhausted, he commenced his retreat (Nov. 14).\r\nWellington descended from the heights, but his marching force was still too\r\nweak to risk a pitched battle. Massena halted and took post at Santarem, on\r\nthe Tagus. Here, and in the neighbouring valley of the Zezere, he\r\nmaintained himself during the winter. But in March, 1811, reinforcements\r\narrived from England: Wellington moved forward against his enemy, and the\r\nretreat of the French began in real earnest. Massena made his way\r\nnorthwards, hard pressed by the English, and devastating the country with\r\nmerciless severity in order to retard pursuit. Fire and ruin marked the\r\ntrack of the retreating army; but such were the sufferings of the French\r\nthemselves, both during the invasion and the retreat, that when Massena\r\nre-entered Spain, after a campaign in which only one pitched battle had\r\nbeen fought, his loss exceeded 30,000 men.\r\n\r\n[Soult conquers Spain as far as Cadiz.]\r\n\r\n[Wellington's campaign of 1811.]\r\n\r\nOther French armies, in spite of a most destructive guerilla warfare, were\r\nin the meantime completing the conquest of the south and the east of Spain.\r\nSoult captured Seville, and began to lay siege to Cadiz. Here, at the end\r\nof 1810, an order reached him from Napoleon to move to the support of\r\nMassena. Leaving Victor in command at Cadiz, Soult marched northwards,\r\nrouted the Spaniards, and conquered the fortress of Badajoz, commanding the\r\nsouthern road into Portugal. Massena, however, was already in retreat, and\r\nSoult's own advance was cut short by intelligence that Graham, the English\r\ngeneral in Cadiz, had broken out upon the besiegers and inflicted a heavy\r\ndefeat. Soult returned to Cadiz and resumed the blockade. Wellington, thus\r\nfreed from danger of attack from the south, and believing Massena to be\r\nthoroughly disabled, considered that the time had come for a forward\r\nmovement into Spain. It was necessary for him to capture the fortresses of\r\nAlmeida and Ciudad Rodrigo on the northern road, and to secure his own\r\ncommunications with Portugal by wresting back Badajoz from the French. He\r\nleft a small force to besiege Almeida, and moved to Elvas to make\r\narrangements with Beresford for the siege of Badajoz. But before the\r\nEnglish commander had deemed it possible, the energy of Massena had\r\nrestored his troops to efficiency; and the two armies of Massena and Soult\r\nwere now ready to assail the English on the north and the south. Massena\r\nmarched against the corps investing Almeida. Wellington hastened back to\r\nmeet him, and fought a battle at Fuentes d'Onoro. The French were defeated;\r\nAlmeida passed into the hands of the English. In the south, Soult advanced\r\nto the relief of Badajoz. He was overthrown by Beresford in the bloody\r\nengagement of Albuera (May 16th); but his junction with the army of the\r\nnorth, which was now transferred from Massena to Marmont, forced the\r\nEnglish to raise the siege; and Wellington, after audaciously offering\r\nbattle to the combined French armies, retired within the Portuguese\r\nfrontier, and marched northwards with the design of laying siege to Ciudad\r\nRodrigo. Again outnumbered by the French, he was compelled to retire to\r\ncantonments on the Coa.\r\n\r\n[Capture of Ciudad Rodrigo, Jan. 19, 1812.]\r\n\r\n[Capture of Badajoz, April 6.]\r\n\r\nThroughout the autumn months, which were spent in forced inaction,\r\nWellington held patiently to his belief that the French would be unable to\r\nkeep their armies long united, on account of the scarcity of food. His\r\ncalculations were correct, and at the close of the year 1811 the English\r\nwere again superior in the field. Wellington moved against Ciudad Rodrigo,\r\nand took it by storm on the 19th of January, 1812. The road into Spain was\r\nopened; it only remained to secure Portugal itself by the capture of\r\nBadajoz. Wellington crossed the Tagus on the 8th of March, and completed\r\nthe investment of Badajoz ten days later. It was necessary to gain\r\npossession of the city, at whatever cost, before Soult could advance to its\r\nrelief. On the night of the 6th of April Wellington gave orders for the\r\nassault. The fury of the attack, the ferocity of the English soldiers in\r\nthe moment of their victory, have made the storm of Badajoz conspicuous\r\namongst the most terrible events of war. But the purpose of Wellington was\r\neffected; the base of the English army in Portugal was secured from all\r\npossibility of attack; and at the moment when Napoleon was summoning his\r\nveteran regiments from beyond the Pyrenees for the invasion of Russia, the\r\nEnglish commander, master of the frontier fortresses of Spain, was\r\npreparing to overwhelm the weakened armies in the Peninsula, and to drive\r\nthe French from Madrid.\r\n\r\n[Wellington invades Spain, June 1812.]\r\n\r\n[Salamanca, July 22.]\r\n\r\n[Wellington retires to Portugal.]\r\n\r\nIt was in the summer of 1812, when Napoleon was now upon the point of\r\nopening the Russian campaign, that Wellington advanced against Marmont's\r\npositions in the north of Spain and the French lines of communication with\r\nthe capital. Marmont fell back and allowed Wellington to pass Salamanca;\r\nbut on reaching the Douro he turned upon his adversary, and by a succession\r\nof swift and skilful marches brought the English into some danger of losing\r\ntheir communications with Portugal. Wellington himself now retreated as far\r\nas Salamanca, and there gave battle (July 22). A decisive victory freed the\r\nEnglish army from its peril, and annihilated all the advantages gained by\r\nMarmont's strategy and speed. The French were so heavily defeated that they\r\nhad to fall back on Burgos. Wellington marched upon Madrid. At his approach\r\nKing Joseph fled from the capital, and ordered Soult to evacuate Andalusia,\r\nand to meet him at Valencia, on the eastern coast. Wellington entered\r\nMadrid amidst the wild rejoicing of the Spaniards, and then turned\r\nnorthwards to complete the destruction of the army which he had beaten at\r\nSalamanca. But the hour of his final success was not yet come. His advance\r\nupon Madrid, though wise as a political measure, had given the French\r\nnorthern army time to rally. He was checked by the obstinate defence of\r\nBurgos; and finding the French strengthened by the very abandonment of\r\nterritory which his victory had forced upon them, he retired to Portugal,\r\ngiving to King Joseph a few months' more precarious enjoyment of his\r\nvassal-sovereignty before his final and irrevocable overthrow.\r\n\r\n[The war excites a constitutional movement in Spain.]\r\n\r\nIn Spain itself the struggle of the nation for its independence had\r\nproduced a political revolution as little foreseen by the Spaniards as by\r\nNapoleon himself when the conflict began. When, in 1808, the people had\r\ntaken up arms for its native dynasty, the voices of those who demanded a\r\nreform in the abuses of the Bourbon government had scarcely been heard amid\r\nthe tumult of loyal enthusiasm for Ferdinand. There existed, however, a\r\ngroup of liberally-minded men in Spain; and as soon as the invasion of the\r\nFrench and the subsequent successes of the Spaniards had overthrown both\r\nthe old repressive system of the Bourbons and that which Napoleon attempted\r\nto put in its place, the opinions of these men, hitherto scarcely known\r\noutside the circle of their own acquaintances, suddenly became a power in\r\nthe country through the liberation of the press. Jovellanos, an upright and\r\nlarge-minded statesman, who had suffered a long imprisonment in the last\r\nreign in consequence of his labours in the cause of progress, now\r\nrepresented in the Central Junta the party of constitutional reform. The\r\nJunta itself acted with but little insight or sincerity. A majority of its\r\nmembers neither desired nor understood the great changes in government\r\nwhich Jovellanos advocated; yet the Junta itself was an irregular and\r\nrevolutionary body, and was forced to appeal to the nation in order to hold\r\nits ground against the old legal Councils of the monarchy, which possessed\r\nnot only a better formal right, but all the habits of authority. The\r\nvictories of Napoleon at the end of 1808, and the threatening attitude both\r\nof the old official bodies and of the new provincial governments which had\r\nsprung up in every part of the kingdom, extorted from the Junta in the\r\nspring of 1809 a declaration in favour of the assembling of the Cortes, or\r\nNational Parliament, in the following year. Once made, the declaration\r\ncould not be nullified or withdrawn. It was in vain that the Junta, alarmed\r\nat the progress of popular opinions, restored the censorship of the press,\r\nand attempted to suppress the liberal journals. The current of political\r\nagitation swept steadily on; and before the end of the year 1809 the\r\nconflict of parties, which Spain was henceforward to experience in common\r\nwith the other Mediterranean States, had fairly begun. [168]\r\n\r\n[Spanish Liberals in 1809 and 1810.]\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Liberals of 1809 made the same attack upon despotic power, and\r\nupheld the same theories of popular right, as the leaders of the French\r\nnation twenty years before. Against them was ranged the whole force of\r\nSpanish officialism, soon to be supported by the overwhelming power of the\r\nclergy. In the outset, however, the Liberals carefully avoided infringing\r\non the prerogatives of the Church. Thus accommodating its policy to the\r\nCatholic spirit of the nation, the party of reform gathered strength\r\nthroughout the year 1809, as disaster after disaster excited the wrath of\r\nthe people against both the past and the present holders of power. It was\r\ndetermined by the Junta that the Cortes should assemble on the 1st of\r\nMarch, 1810. According to the ancient usage of Spain, each of the Three\r\nEstates, the Clergy, the Nobles, and the Commons, would have been\r\nrepresented in the Cortes by a separate assembly. The opponents of reform\r\npressed for the maintenance of this mediæval order, the Liberals declared\r\nfor a single Chamber; the Junta, guided by Jovellanos, adopted a middle\r\ncourse, and decided that the higher clergy and nobles should be jointly\r\nrepresented by one Chamber, the Commons by a second. Writs of election had\r\nalready been issued, when the Junta, driven to Cadiz by the advance of the\r\nFrench armies, and assailed alike by Liberals, by reactionists, and by city\r\nmobs, ended its ineffective career, and resigned its powers into the hands\r\nof a Regency composed of five persons (Jan. 30, 1810). Had the Regency\r\nimmediately taken steps to assemble the Cortes, Spain would probably have\r\nbeen content with the moderate reforms which two Chambers, formed according\r\nto the plans of Jovellanos, would have been likely to sanction. The\r\nRegency, however, preferred to keep power in its own hands and ignored the\r\npromise which the Junta had given to the nation. Its policy of obstruction,\r\nwhich was continued for months after the time when the Cortes ought to have\r\nassembled, threw the Liberal party into the hands of men of extremes, and\r\nprepared the way for revolution instead of reform. It was only when the\r\nreport reached Spain that Ferdinand was about to marry the daughter of King\r\nJoseph, and to accept the succession to the Spanish crown from the usurper\r\nhimself, that the Regency consented to convoke the Cortes. But it was now\r\nno longer possible to create an Upper House to serve as a check upon the\r\npopular Assembly. A single Chamber was elected, and elected in great part\r\nwithin the walls of Cadiz itself; for the representatives of districts\r\nwhere the presence of French soldiery rendered election impossible were\r\nchosen by refugees from those districts within Cadiz, amid the tumults of\r\npolitical passion which stir a great city in time of war and revolution.\r\n\r\n[Constitution made by the Cortes, 1812.]\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of September, 1810, the Cortes opened. Its first act was to\r\ndeclare the sovereignty of the people, its next act to declare the freedom\r\nof the Press. In every debate a spirit of bitter hatred towards the old\r\nsystem of government and of deep distrust towards Ferdinand himself\r\nrevealed itself in the speeches of the Liberal deputies, although no one in\r\nthe Assembly dared to avow the least want of loyalty towards the exiled\r\nHouse. The Liberals knew how passionate was the love of the Spanish people\r\nfor their Prince; but they resolved that, if Ferdinand returned to his\r\nthrone, he should return without the power to revive the old abuses of\r\nBourbon rule. In this spirit the Assembly proceeded to frame a Constitution\r\nfor Spain. The Crown was treated as the antagonist and corrupter of the\r\npeople; its administrative powers were jealously reduced; it was confronted\r\nby an Assembly to be elected every two years, and the members of this\r\nAssembly were prohibited both from holding office under the Crown, and from\r\npresenting themselves for re-election at the end of their two years'\r\nservice. To a Representative Body thus excluded from all possibility of\r\ngaining any practical acquaintance with public affairs was entrusted not\r\nonly the right of making laws, but the control of every branch of\r\ngovernment. The executive was reduced to a mere cypher.\r\n\r\n[The Clergy against the Constitution.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the Constitution which, under the fire of the French artillery now\r\nencompassing Cadiz, the Cortes of Spain proclaimed in the spring of the\r\nyear 1812. Its principles had excited the most vehement opposition within\r\nthe Assembly itself; by the nation, or at least that part of it which was\r\nin communication with Cadiz, it appeared to be received with enthusiasm.\r\nThe Liberals, who had triumphed over their opponents in the debates in the\r\nAssembly, believed that their own victory was the victory of the Spanish\r\npeople over the forces of despotism. But before the first rejoicings were\r\nover, ominous signs appeared of the strength of the opposite party, and of\r\nthe incapacity of the Liberals themselves to form any effective Government.\r\nThe fanaticism of the clergy was excited by a law partly ratifying the\r\nsuppression of monasteries begun by Joseph Bonaparte; the enactments of the\r\nCortes regarding the censorship of religious writings threw the Church into\r\nopen revolt. In declaring the freedom of the Press, the Cortes had\r\nexpressly guarded themselves against extending this freedom to religious\r\ndiscussion; the clergy now demanded the restoration of the powers of the\r\nInquisition, which had been in abeyance since the beginning of the war. The\r\nCortes were willing to grant to the Bishops the right of condemning any\r\nwriting as heretical, and they were willing to enforce by means of the\r\nordinary tribunals the law which declared the Catholic religion to be the\r\nonly one permitted in Spain; but they declined to restore the jurisdiction\r\nof the Holy Office (Feb., 1813). Without this engine for the suppression of\r\nall mental independence the priesthood of Spain conceived its cause to be\r\nlost. The anathema of the Church went out against the new order. Uniting\r\nwith the partisans of absolutism, whom Wellington, provoked by the\r\nextravagances of the Liberals, now took under his protection, the clergy\r\nexcited an ignorant people against its own emancipators, and awaited the\r\ntime when the return of Ferdinand, and a combination of all the interests\r\nhostile to reform, should overthrow the Constitution which the Liberals\r\nfondly imagined to have given freedom to Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nWar approaching between France and Russia--Policy of Prussia--Hardenberg's\r\nMinistry--Prussia forced into Alliance with Napoleon--Austrian Alliance--\r\nNapoleon's Preparations--He enters Russia--Alexander and Bernadotte--Plan\r\nof the Russians to fight a Battle at Drissa frustrated--They retreat on\r\nWitepsk--Sufferings of the French--French enter Smolensko--Battle of\r\nBorodino--Evacuation of Moscow--Moscow fired--The Retreat from Moscow--The\r\nFrench at Smolensko--Advance of Russian Armies from North and South--\r\nBattle of Krasnoi--Passage of the Beresina--The French reach the Niemen--\r\nYork's Convention with the Russians--The Czar and Stein--Russian Army\r\nenters Prussia--Stein raises East Prussia--Treaty of Kalisch--Prussia\r\ndeclares War--Enthusiasm of the Nation--Idea of German Unity--The Landwehr.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Austria and Prussia in 1811.]\r\n\r\n[Hardenberg's Ministry.]\r\n\r\nWar between France and Russia was known to be imminent as early as the\r\nspring of 1811. The approach of the conflict was watched with the deepest\r\nanxiety by the two States of central Europe which still retained some\r\ndegree of independence. The Governments of Berlin and Vienna had been drawn\r\ntogether by misfortune. The same ultimate deliverance formed the secret\r\nhope of both; but their danger was too great to permit them to combine in\r\nopen resistance to Napoleon's will. In spite of a tacit understanding\r\nbetween the two powers, each was compelled for the present to accept the\r\nconditions necessary to secure its own existence. The situation of Prussia\r\nin especial was one of the utmost danger. Its territory lay directly\r\nbetween the French Empire and Russia; its fortresses were in the hands of\r\nNapoleon, its resources were certain to be seized by one or other of the\r\nhostile armies. Neutrality was impossible, however much desired by Prussia\r\nitself; and the only question to be decided by the Government was whether\r\nPrussia should enter the war as the ally of France or of Russia. Had the\r\nparty of Stein been in power, Prussia would have taken arms against\r\nNapoleon at every risk. Stein, however, was in exile his friends, though\r\nstrong in the army, were not masters of the Government; the foreign policy\r\nof the country was directed by a statesman who trusted more to time and\r\nprudent management than to desperate resolves. Hardenberg had been recalled\r\nto office in 1810, and permitted to resume the great measures of civil\r\nreform which had been broken off two years before. The machinery of\r\nGovernment was reconstructed upon principles that had been laid down by\r\nStein; agrarian reform was carried still farther by the abolition of\r\npeasant's service, and the partition of peasant's land between the occupant\r\nand his lord; an experiment, though a very ill-managed one, was made in the\r\nforms of constitutional Government by the convocation of three successive\r\nassemblies of the Notables. On the part of the privileged orders Hardenberg\r\nencountered the most bitter opposition; his own love of absolute power\r\nprevented him from winning popular confidence by any real approach towards\r\na Representative System. Nor was the foreign policy of the Minister of a\r\ncharacter to excite enthusiasm. A true patriot at heart, he seemed at times\r\nto be destitute of patriotism, when he was in fact only destitute of the\r\npower to reveal his real motives.\r\n\r\n[Hardenberg's foreign policy, 1811.]\r\n\r\nConvinced that Prussia could not remain neutral in the coming war, and\r\nbelieving some relief from its present burdens to be absolutely necessary,\r\nHardenberg determined in the first instance to offer Prussia's support to\r\nNapoleon, demanding in return for it a reduction of the payments still due\r\nto France, and the removal of the limits imposed upon the Prussian army.\r\n[169] The offer of the Prussian alliance reached Napoleon in the spring of\r\n1811: he maintained an obstinate silence. While the Prussian envoy at Paris\r\nvainly waited for an audience, masses of troops advanced from the Rhine\r\ntowards the Prussian frontier, and the French garrisons on the Oder were\r\nraised far beyond their stipulated strength. In July the envoy returned\r\nfrom Paris, announcing that Napoleon declined even to enter upon a\r\ndiscussion of the terms proposed by Hardenberg. King Frederick William\r\nnow wrote to the Czar, proposing an alliance between Prussia and Russia.\r\nIt was not long before the report of Hardenberg's military preparations\r\nreached Paris. Napoleon announced that if they were not immediately\r\nsuspended he should order Davoust to march on Berlin; and he presented a\r\ncounter-proposition for a Prussian alliance, which was in fact one of\r\nunqualified submission. The Government had to decide between accepting a\r\ntreaty which placed Prussia among Napoleon's vassals, or certain war.\r\nHardenberg, expecting favourable news from St. Petersburg, pronounced in\r\nfavour of war; but the Czar, though anxious for the support of Prussia,\r\nhad determined on a defensive plan of operations, and declared that he\r\ncould send no troops beyond the Russian frontier.\r\n\r\n[Prussia accepts alliance with Napoleon Feb, 1812.]\r\n\r\nPrussia was thus left to face Napoleon alone. Hardenberg shrank from the\r\nresponsibility of proclaiming a war for life or death, and a treaty was\r\nsigned which added the people of Frederick the Great to that inglorious\r\ncrowd which fought at Napoleon's orders against whatever remained of\r\nindependence and nationality in Europe. [170] (Feb. 24th, 1812.) Prussia\r\nundertook to supply Napoleon with 20,000 men for the impending campaign,\r\nand to raise no levies and to give no orders to its troops without\r\nNapoleon's consent. Such was the bitter termination of all those patriotic\r\nhopes and efforts which had carried Prussia through its darkest days.\r\nHardenberg himself might make a merit of bending before the storm, and of\r\npreserving for Prussia the means of striking when the time should come; but\r\nthe simpler instincts of the patriotic party felt his submission to be the\r\nvery surrender of national existence. Stein in his exile denounced the\r\nMinister with unsparing bitterness. Scharnhorst resigned his post; many of\r\nthe best officers in the Prussian army quitted the service of King\r\nFrederick William in order to join the Russians in the last struggle for\r\nEuropean liberty.\r\n\r\n[Alliance of Austria with Napoleon.]\r\n\r\nThe alliance which Napoleon pressed upon Austria was not of the same\r\nhumiliating character as that which Prussia was forced to accept. Both\r\nMetternich and the Emperor Francis would have preferred to remain neutral,\r\nfor the country was suffering from a fearful State-bankruptcy, and the\r\nGovernment had been compelled to reduce its paper money, in which all debts\r\nand salaries were payable, to a fifth of its nominal value. Napoleon,\r\nhowever, insisted on Austria's co-operation. The family-relations of the\r\ntwo Emperors pointed to a close alliance, and the reward which Napoleon\r\nheld out to Austria, the restoration of the Illyrian provinces, was one of\r\nthe utmost value. Nor was the Austrian contingent to be treated, like the\r\nPrussian, as a mere French army-corps. Its operations were to be separate\r\nfrom those of the French, and its command was to be held by an Austrian\r\ngeneral, subordinate only to Napoleon himself. On these terms Metternich\r\nwas not unwilling to enter the campaign. He satisfied his scruples by\r\ninventing a strange diplomatic form in which Austria was still described as\r\na neutral, although she took part in the war, [171] and felt as little\r\ncompunction in uniting with France as in explaining to the Courts of St.\r\nPetersburg and Berlin that the union was a hypocritical one. The Sovereign\r\nwho was about to be attacked by Napoleon, and the Sovereigns who sent their\r\ntroops to Napoleon's support, perfectly well understood one another's\r\nposition. The Prussian corps, watched and outnumbered by the French, might\r\nhave to fight the Russians because they could not help it; the Austrians,\r\ndirected by their own commander, would do no serious harm to the Russians\r\nso long as the Russians did no harm to them. Should the Czar succeed in\r\ngiving a good account of his adversary, he would have no difficulty in\r\ncoming to a settlement with his adversary's forced allies.\r\n\r\n[Preparations of Napoleon for invasion of Russia.]\r\n\r\nThe Treaties which gave to Napoleon the hollow support of Austria and\r\nPrussia were signed early in the year 1812. During the next three months\r\nall Northern Germany was covered with enormous masses of troops and\r\nwaggon-trains, on their way from the Rhine to the Vistula. No expedition\r\nhad ever been organised on anything approaching to the scale of the\r\ninvasion of Russia. In all the wars of the French since 1793 the enemy's\r\ncountry had furnished their armies with supplies, and the generals had\r\ntrusted to their own exertions for everything but guns and ammunition. Such\r\na method could not, however, be followed in an invasion of Russia. The\r\ncountry beyond the Niemen was no well-stocked garden, like Lombardy or\r\nBavaria. Provisions for a mass of 450,000 men, with all the means of\r\ntransport for carrying them far into Russia, had to be collected at Dantzig\r\nand the fortresses of the Vistula. No mercy was shown to the unfortunate\r\ncountries whose position now made them Napoleon's harvest-field and\r\nstorehouse. Prussia was forced to supplement its military assistance with\r\ncolossal grants of supplies. The whole of Napoleon's troops upon the march\r\nthrough Germany lived at the expense of the towns and villages through\r\nwhich they passed; in Westphalia such was the ruin caused by military\r\nrequisitions that King Jerome wrote to Napoleon, warning him to fear the\r\ndespair of men who had nothing more to lose. [172]\r\n\r\n[Napoleon crosses Russian frontier, June, 1812.]\r\n\r\n[Alexander and Bernadotte.]\r\n\r\nAt length the vast stores were collected, and the invading army reached the\r\nVistula. Napoleon himself quitted Paris on the 9th of May, and received the\r\nhomage of the Austrian and Prussian Sovereigns at Dresden. The eastward\r\nmovement of the army continued. The Polish and East Prussian districts\r\nwhich had been the scene of the combats of 1807 were again traversed by\r\nFrench columns. On the 23rd of June the order was given to cross the Niemen\r\nand enter Russian territory. Out of 600,000 troops whom Napoleon had\r\norganised for this campaign, 450,000 were actually upon the frontier. Of\r\nthese, 380,000 formed the central army, under Napoleon's own command, at\r\nKowno, on the Niemen; to the north, at Tilsit, there was formed a corps of\r\n32,000, which included the contingent furnished by Prussia; the Austrians,\r\nunder Schwarzenburg, with a small French division, lay to the south, on the\r\nborders of Galicia. Against the main army of Napoleon, the real invading\r\nforce, the Russians could only bring up 150,000 men. These were formed into\r\nthe First and Second Armies of the West. The First, or Northern Army, with\r\nwhich the Czar himself was present, numbered about 100,000, under the\r\ncommand of Barclay de Tolly; the Second Army, half that strength, was led\r\nby Prince Bagration. In Southern Poland and on the Lower Niemen the French\r\nauxiliary corps were faced by weak divisions. In all, the Russians had only\r\n220,000 men to oppose to more than double that number of the enemy. The\r\nprincipal reinforcements which they had to expect were from the armies\r\nhitherto engaged with the Turks upon the Danube. Alexander found it\r\nnecessary to make peace with the Porte at the cost of a part of the spoils\r\nof Tilsit. The Danubian provinces, with the exception of Bessarabia, were\r\nrestored to the Sultan, in order that Russia might withdraw its forces from\r\nthe south. Bernadotte, Crown Prince of Sweden, who was threatened with the\r\nloss of his own dominions in the event of Napoleon's victory, concluded an\r\nalliance with the Czar. In return for the co-operation of a Swedish army,\r\nAlexander undertook, with an indifference to national right worthy of\r\nNapoleon himself, to wrest Norway from Denmark, and to annex it to the\r\nSwedish crown.\r\n\r\n[Russians intend to fight at Drissa.]\r\n\r\n[Russian armies severed, and retreat on Witepsk.]\r\n\r\nThe head-quarters of the Russian army were at Wilna when Napoleon crossed\r\nthe Niemen. It was unknown whether the French intended to advance upon\r\nMoscow or upon St. Petersburg; nor had any systematic plan of the campaign\r\nbeen adopted by the Czar. The idea of falling back before the enemy was\r\nindeed familiar in Russia since the war between Peter the Great and Charles\r\nXII. of Sweden, and there was no want of good counsel in favour of a\r\ndefensive warfare; [173] but neither the Czar nor any one of his generals\r\nunderstood the simple theory of a retreat in which no battles at all should\r\nbe fought. The most that was understood by a defensive system was the\r\noccupation of an entrenched position for battle, and a retreat to a second\r\nline of entrenchments before the engagement was repeated. The actual course\r\nof the campaign was no result of a profound design; it resulted from the\r\ndisagreements of the general's plans, and the frustration of them all. It\r\nwas intended in the first instance to fight a battle at Drissa, on the\r\nriver Dwina. In this position, which was supposed to cover the roads both\r\nto Moscow and St. Petersburg, a great entrenched camp had been formed, and\r\nhere the Russian army was to make its first stand against Napoleon.\r\nAccordingly, as soon as the French crossed the Niemen, both Barclay and\r\nBagration were ordered by the Czar to fall back upon Drissa. But the\r\nmovements of the French army were too rapid for the Russian commanders to\r\neffect their junction. Bagration, who lay at some distance to the south,\r\nwas cut off from his colleague, and forced to retreat along the eastern\r\nroad towards Witepsk. Barclay reached Drissa in safety, but he knew himself\r\nto be unable to hold it alone against 300,000 men. He evacuated the lines\r\nwithout waiting for the approach of the French, and fell back in the\r\ndirection taken by the second army. The first movement of defence had thus\r\nfailed, and the Czar now quitted the camp, leaving to Barclay the command\r\nof the whole Russian forces.\r\n\r\n[Collapse of the French transport.]\r\n\r\n[Barclay and Bagration unite at Smolensko, Aug. 3.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon entered Wilna, the capital of Russian Poland, on the 28th of June.\r\nThe last Russian detachments had only left it a few hours before; but the\r\nFrench were in no condition for immediate pursuit. Before the army reached\r\nthe Niemen the unparalleled difficulties of the campaign had become only\r\ntoo clear. The vast waggon-trains broke down on the highways. The stores\r\nwere abundant, but the animals which had to transport them died of\r\nexhaustion. No human genius, no perfection of foresight and care, could\r\nhave achieved the enormous task which Napoleon had undertaken. In spite of\r\na year's preparations the French suffered from hunger and thirst from the\r\nmoment that they set foot on Russian soil. Thirty thousand stragglers had\r\nleft the army before it reached Wilna; twenty-five thousand sick were in\r\nthe hospitals; the transports were at an unknown distance in the rear. At\r\nthe end of six days' march from the Niemen, Napoleon found himself\r\ncompelled to halt for nearly three weeks. The army did not leave Wilna till\r\nthe 16th of July, when Barclay had already evacuated the camp at Drissa.\r\nWhen at length a march became possible, Napoleon moved upon the Upper\r\nDwina, hoping to intercept Barclay upon the road to Witepsk; but\r\ndifficulties of transport again brought him to a halt, and the Russian\r\ncommander reached Witepsk before his adversary. Here Barclay drew up for\r\nbattle, supposing Bagration's army to be but a short distance to the south.\r\nIn the course of the night intelligence arrived that Bagration's army was\r\nnowhere near the rallying-point, but had been driven back towards\r\nSmolensko. Barclay immediately gave up the thought of fighting a battle,\r\nand took the road to Smolensko himself, leaving his watch-fires burning.\r\nHis movement was unperceived by the French; the retreat was made in good\r\norder; and the two severed Russian armies at length effected their junction\r\nat a point three hundred miles distant from the frontier.\r\n\r\n[The French waste away.]\r\n\r\n[French enter Smolensko, Aug. 18.]\r\n\r\n[Barclay superseded by Kutusoff.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon, disappointed of battle, entered Witepsk on the evening after the\r\nRussians had abandoned it (July 28). Barclay's escape was, for the French,\r\na disaster of the first magnitude, since it extinguished all hope of\r\ncrushing the larger of the two Russian armies by overwhelming numbers in\r\none great and decisive engagement. The march of the French during the last\r\ntwelve days showed at what cost every further step must be made. Since\r\nquitting Wilna the 50,000 sick and stragglers had risen to 100,000. Fever\r\nand disease struck down whole regiments. The provisioning of the army was\r\nbeyond all human power. Of the 200,000 men who still remained, it might\r\nalmost be calculated in how many weeks the last would perish. So fearful\r\nwas the prospect that Napoleon himself thought of abandoning any further\r\nadvance until the next year, and of permitting the army to enter into\r\nwinter-quarters upon the Dwina. But the conviction that all Russian\r\nresistance would end with the capture of Moscow hurried him on. The army\r\nleft Witepsk on the 13th of August, and followed the Russians to Smolensko.\r\nHere the entire Russian army clamoured for battle. Barclay stood alone in\r\nperceiving the necessity for retreat. The generals caballed against him;\r\nthe soldiers were on the point of mutiny; the Czar himself wrote to express\r\nhis impatience for an attack upon the French. Barclay nevertheless\r\npersisted in his resolution to abandon Smolensko. He so far yielded to the\r\narmy as to permit the rearguard to engage in a bloody struggle with the\r\nFrench when they assaulted the town; but the evacuation was completed under\r\ncover of night; and when the French made their entrance into Smolensko on\r\nthe next morning they found it deserted and in rums. The surrender of\r\nSmolensko was the last sacrifice that Barclay could extort from Russian\r\npride. He no longer opposed the universal cry for battle, and the retreat\r\nwas continued only with the intention of halting at the first strong\r\nposition. Barclay himself was surveying a battleground when he heard that\r\nthe command had been taken out of his hands. The Czar had been forced by\r\nnational indignation at the loss of Smolensko to remove this able soldier,\r\nwho was a Livonian by birth, and to transfer the command to Kutusoff, a\r\nthorough Russian, whom a life-time spent in victories over the Turk had\r\nmade, in spite of his defeat at Austerlitz, the idol of the nation.\r\n\r\n[The French advance from Smolensko.]\r\n\r\nWhen Kutusoff reached the camp, the prolonged miseries of the French\r\nadvance had already reduced the invaders to the number of the army opposed\r\nto them. As far as Smolensko the French had at least not suffered from the\r\nhostility of the population, who were Poles, not Russians; but on reaching\r\nSmolensko they entered a country where every peasant was a fanatical enemy.\r\nThe villages were burnt down by their inhabitants, the corn destroyed, and\r\nthe cattle driven into the woods. Every day's march onward from Smolensko\r\ncost the French three thousand men. On reaching the river Moskwa in the\r\nfirst week of September, a hundred and seventy-five thousand out of\r\nNapoleon's three hundred and eighty thousand soldiers were in the\r\nhospitals, or missing, or dead. About sixty thousand guarded the line of\r\nmarch. The Russians, on the other hand, had received reinforcements which\r\ncovered their losses at Smolensko; and although detachments had been sent\r\nto support the army of Riga, Kutusoff was still able to place over one\r\nhundred thousand men in the field.\r\n\r\n[Battle of Borodino, Sept. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Evacuation of Moscow. French enter Moscow, Sept. 14.]\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of September the Russian army drew up for battle at Borodino, on\r\nthe Moskwa, seventy miles west of the capital. At early morning on the 7th\r\nthe French advanced to the attack. The battle was, in proportion to its\r\nnumbers, the most sanguinary of modern times. Forty thousand French, thirty\r\nthousand Russians were struck down. At the close of the day the French were\r\nin possession of the enemy's ground, but the Russians, unbroken in their\r\norder, had only retreated to a second line of defence. Both sides claimed\r\nthe victory; neither had won it. It was no catastrophe such as Napoleon\r\nrequired for the decision of the war, it was no triumph sufficient to save\r\nRussia from the necessity of abandoning its capital. Kutusoff had sustained\r\ntoo heavy a loss to face the French beneath the walls of Moscow. Peace was\r\nno nearer for the 70,000 men who had been killed or wounded in the fight.\r\nThe French steadily advanced; the Russians retreated to Moscow, and\r\nevacuated the capital when their generals decided that they could not\r\nencounter the French assault. The Holy City was left undefended before the\r\ninvader. But the departure of the army was the smallest part of the\r\nevacuation. The inhabitants, partly of their own free will, partly under\r\nthe compulsion of the Governor, abandoned the city in a mass. No gloomy or\r\nexcited crowd, as at Vienna and Berlin, thronged the streets to witness the\r\nentrance of the great conqueror, when on the 14th of September Napoleon\r\ntook possession of Moscow. His troops marched through silent and deserted\r\nstreets. In the solitude of the Kremlin Napoleon received the homage of a\r\nfew foreigners, who alone could be collected by his servants to tender to\r\nhim the submission of the city.\r\n\r\n[Moscow fired.]\r\n\r\nBut the worst was yet to come. On the night after Napoleon's entry, fires\r\nbroke out in different parts of Moscow. They were ascribed at first to\r\naccident; but when on the next day the French saw the flames gaining ground\r\nin every direction, and found that all the means for extinguishing fire had\r\nbeen removed from the city, they understood the doom to which Moscow had\r\nbeen devoted by its own defenders. Count Rostopchin, the governor, had\r\ndetermined on the destruction of Moscow without the knowledge of the Czar.\r\nThe doors of the prisons were thrown open. Rostopchin gave the signal by\r\nsetting fire to his own palace, and let loose his bands of incendiaries\r\nover the city. For five days the flames rose and fell; and when, on the\r\nevening of the 20th, the last fires ceased, three-fourths of Moscow lay in\r\nruins.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon at Moscow, Sept. 14-Oct. 19.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the prize for which Napoleon had sacrificed 200,000 men, and\r\nengulfed the weak remnant of his army six hundred miles deep in an enemy's\r\ncountry. Throughout all the terrors of the advance Napoleon had held fast\r\nto the belief that Alexander's resistance would end with the fall of his\r\ncapital. The events that accompanied the entry of the French into Moscow\r\nshook his confidence; yet even now Napoleon could not believe that the Czar\r\nremained firm against all thoughts of peace. His experience in all earlier\r\nwars had given him confidence in the power of one conspicuous disaster to\r\nunhinge the resolution of kings. His trust in the deepening impression made\r\nby the fall of Moscow was fostered by negotiations begun by Kutusoff for\r\nthe very purpose of delaying the French retreat. For five weeks Napoleon\r\nremained at Moscow as if spell-bound, unable to convince himself of his\r\npowerlessness to break Alexander's determination, unable to face a retreat\r\nwhich would display to all Europe the failure of his arms and the\r\ntermination of his career of victory. At length the approach of winter\r\nforced him to action. It was impossible to provision the army at Moscow\r\nduring the winter months, even if there had been nothing to fear from the\r\nenemy. Even the mocking overtures of Kutusoff had ceased. The frightful\r\nreality could no longer be concealed. On the 19th of October the order for\r\nretreat was given. It was not the destruction of Moscow, but the departure\r\nof its inhabitants, that had brought the conqueror to ruin. Above two\r\nthousand houses were still standing; but whether the buildings remained or\r\nperished made little difference; the whole value of the capital to Napoleon\r\nwas lost when the inhabitants, whom he could have forced to procure\r\nsupplies for his army, disappeared. Vienna and Berlin had been of such\r\nincalculable service to Napoleon because the whole native administration\r\nplaced itself under his orders, and every rich and important citizen became\r\na hostage for the activity of the rest. When the French gained Moscow, they\r\ngained nothing beyond the supplies which were at that moment in the city.\r\nAll was lost to Napoleon when the class who in other capitals had been his\r\ninstruments fled at his approach. The conflagration of Moscow acted upon\r\nall Europe as a signal of inextinguishable national hatred; as a military\r\noperation, it neither accelerated the retreat of Napoleon nor added to the\r\nmiseries which his army had to undergo.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon leaves Moscow, Oct. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Forced to retreat by the same road.]\r\n\r\nThe French forces which quitted Moscow in October numbered about 100,000\r\nmen. Reinforcements had come in during the occupation of the city, and the\r\nhealth of the soldiers had been in some degree restored by a month's rest.\r\nEverything now depended upon gaining a line of retreat where food could be\r\nfound. Though but a fourth part of the army which entered Russia in the\r\nsummer, the army which left Moscow was still large enough to protect itself\r\nagainst the enemy, if allowed to retreat through a fresh country; if forced\r\nback upon the devastated line of its advance it was impossible for it to\r\nescape destruction. Napoleon therefore determined to make for Kaluga, on\r\nthe south of Moscow, and to endeavour to gain a road to Smolensko far\r\ndistant from that by which he had come. The army moved from Moscow in a\r\nsouthern direction. But its route had been foreseen by Kutusoff. At the end\r\nof four days' march it was met by a Russian corps at Jaroslavitz. A bloody\r\nstruggle left the French in possession of the road: they continued their\r\nadvance; but it was only to find that Kutusoff, with his full strength, had\r\noccupied a line of heights farther south, and barred the way to Kaluga. The\r\neffort of an assault was beyond the powers of the French. Napoleon surveyed\r\nthe enemy's position, and recognised the fatal necessity of abandoning the\r\nmarch southwards and returning to the wasted road by which he had advanced.\r\nThe meaning of the backward movement was quickly understood by the army.\r\nFrom the moment of quitting Jaroslavitz, disorder and despair increased\r\nwith every march. Thirty thousand men were lost upon the road before a\r\npursuer appeared in sight. When, on the 2nd of November, the army reached\r\nWiazma, it numbered no more than 65,000 men.\r\n\r\n[Kutusoff follows by parallel road.]\r\n\r\nKutusoff was unadventurous in pursuit. The necessity of moving his army\r\nalong a parallel road south of the French, in order to avoid starvation,\r\ndiminished the opportunities for attack; but the general himself disliked\r\nrisking his forces, and preferred to see the enemy's destruction effected\r\nby the elements. At Wiazma, where, on the 3rd of November, the French were\r\nfor the first time attacked in force, Kutusoff's own delay alone saved them\r\nfrom total ruin. In spite of heavy loss the French kept possession of the\r\nroad, and secured their retreat to Smolensko, where stores of food had been\r\naccumulated, and where other and less exhausted French troops were at hand.\r\n\r\n[Frost, Nov. 6.]\r\n\r\n[French reach Smolensko, Nov. 9.]\r\n\r\nUp to the 6th of November the weather had been sunny and dry. On the 6th\r\nthe long-delayed terrors of Russian winter broke upon the pursuers and the\r\npursued. Snow darkened the air and hid the last traces of vegetation from\r\nthe starving cavalry trains. The temperature sank at times to forty degrees\r\nof frost. Death came, sometimes in the unfelt release from misery,\r\nsometimes in horrible forms of mutilation and disease. Both armies were\r\nexposed to the same sufferings; but the Russians had at least such succour\r\nas their countrymen could give; where the French sank, they died. The order\r\nof war disappeared under conditions which made life itself the accident of\r\na meal or of a place by the camp-fire. Though most of the French soldiery\r\ncontinued to carry their arms, the Guard alone kept its separate formation;\r\nthe other regiments marched in confused masses. From the 9th to the 13th of\r\nNovember these starving bands arrived one after another at Smolensko,\r\nexpecting that here their sufferings would end. But the organisation for\r\ndistributing the stores accumulated in Smolensko no longer existed. The\r\nperishing crowds were left to find shelter where they could; sacks of corn\r\nwere thrown to them for food.\r\n\r\n[Russian armies from north and south attempt to cut off French retreat.]\r\n\r\n[Krasnoi, Nov. 17.]\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for Napoleon to give his wearied soldiers rest, for new\r\nRussian armies were advancing from the north and the south to cut off their\r\nretreat. From the Danube and from the Baltic Sea troops were pressing\r\nforward to their meeting-point upon the rear of the invader. Witgenstein,\r\nmoving southwards at the head of the army of the Dwina, had overpowered the\r\nFrench corps stationed upon that river, and made himself master of Witepsk.\r\nThe army of Bucharest, which had been toiling northwards ever since the\r\nbeginning of August, had advanced to within a few days' march of its\r\nmeeting-point with the army of the Dwina upon the line of Napoleon's\r\ncommunications. Before Napoleon reached Smolensko he sent orders to Victor,\r\nwho was at Smolensko with some reserves, to march against Witgenstein and\r\ndrive him back upon the Dwina. Victor set out on his mission. During the\r\nshort halt of Napoleon in Smolensko, Kutusoff pushed forward to the west of\r\nthe French, and took post at Krasnoi, thirty miles farther along the road\r\nby which Napoleon had to pass. The retreat of the French seemed to be\r\nactually cut off. Had the Russian general dared to face Napoleon and his\r\nGuards, he might have held the French in check until the arrival of the two\r\nauxiliary armies from the north and south enabled him to capture Napoleon\r\nand his entire force. Kutusoff, however, preferred a partial and certain\r\nvictory to a struggle with Napoleon for life or death. He permitted\r\nNapoleon and the Guard to pass by unattacked, and then fell upon the hinder\r\ndivisions of the French army. (Nov. 17.) These unfortunate troops were\r\nsuccessively cut to pieces. Twenty-six thousand were made prisoners. Ney,\r\nwith a part of the rear-guard, only escaped by crossing the Dnieper on the\r\nice. Of the army that had quitted Moscow there now remained but 10,000\r\ncombatants and 20,000 followers. Kutusoff himself was brought to such a\r\nstate of exhaustion that he could carry the pursuit no further, and entered\r\ninto quarters upon the Dnieper.\r\n\r\n[Victor joins Napoleon.]\r\n\r\n[Passage of the Beresina, Nov. 28th.]\r\n\r\nIt was a few days after the battle at Krasnoi that the divisions of Victor,\r\ncoming from the direction of the Dwina, suddenly encountered the remnant\r\nof Napoleon's army. Though aware that Napoleon was in retreat, they knew\r\nnothing of the calamities that had befallen him, and were struck with\r\namazement when, in the middle of a forest, they met with what seemed more\r\nlike a miserable troop of captives than an army upon the march. Victor's\r\nsoldiers of a mere auxiliary corps found themselves more than double the\r\neffective strength of the whole army of Moscow. Their arrival again placed\r\nNapoleon at the head of 30,000 disciplined troops, and gave the French a\r\ngleam of victory in the last and seemingly most hopeless struggle in the\r\ncampaign. Admiral Tchitchagoff, in command of the army marching from the\r\nDanube, had at length reached the line of Napoleon's retreat, and\r\nestablished himself at Borisov, where the road through Poland crosses the\r\nriver Beresina. The bridge was destroyed by the Russians, and Tchitchagoff\r\nopened communication with Witgenstein's army, which lay only a few miles to\r\nthe north. It appeared as if the retreat of the French was now finally\r\nintercepted, and the surrender of Napoleon inevitable. Yet even in this\r\nhopeless situation the military skill and daring of the French worked with\r\nsomething of its ancient power. The army reached the Beresina; Napoleon\r\nsucceeded in withdrawing the enemy from the real point of passage; bridges\r\nwere thrown across the river, and after desperate fighting a great part of\r\nthe army made good its footing upon the western bank (Nov. 28). But the\r\nlosses even among the effective troops were enormous. The fate of the\r\nmiserable crowd that followed them, torn by the cannon-fire of the\r\nRussians, and precipitated into the river by the breaking of one of the\r\nbridges, has made the passage of the Beresina a synonym for the utmost\r\ndegree of human woe.\r\n\r\n[French reach the Niemen, Dec. 13.]\r\n\r\nThis was the last engagement fought by the army. The Guards still preserved\r\ntheir order: Marshal Ney still found soldiers capable of turning upon the\r\npursuer with his own steady and unflagging courage; but the bulk of the\r\narmy struggled forward in confused crowds, harassed by the Cossacks, and\r\nlaying down their arms by thousands before the enemy. The frost, which had\r\nbroken up on the 19th, returned on the 30th of November with even greater\r\nseverity. Twenty thousand fresh troops which joined the army between the\r\nBeresina and Wilna scarcely arrested the process of dissolution. On the 3rd\r\nof December Napoleon quitted the army. Wilna itself was abandoned with all\r\nits stores; and when at length the fugitives reached the Niemen, they\r\nnumbered little more than twenty thousand. Here, six months earlier, three\r\nhundred and eighty thousand men had crossed with Napoleon. A hundred\r\nthousand more had joined the army in the course of its retreat. Of all this\r\nhost, not the twentieth part reached the Prussian frontier. A hundred and\r\nseventy thousand remained prisoners in the hands of the Russians; a greater\r\nnumber had perished. Of the twenty thousand men who now beheld the Niemen,\r\nprobably not seven thousand had crossed with Napoleon. In the presence of a\r\ncatastrophe so overwhelming and so unparalleled the Russian generals might\r\nwell be content with their own share in the work of destruction. Yet the\r\nevent proved that Kutusoff had done ill in sparing the extremest effort to\r\ncapture or annihilate his foe. Not only was Napoleon's own escape the\r\npledge of continued war, but the remnant that escaped with him possessed a\r\nmilitary value out of all proportion to its insignificant numbers. The best\r\nof the army were the last to succumb. Out of those few thousands who\r\nendured to the end, a very large proportion were veteran officers, who\r\nimmediately took their place at the head of Napoleon's newly-raised armies,\r\nand gave to them a military efficiency soon to be bitterly proved by Europe\r\non many a German battle-field.\r\n\r\n[York's convention with the Russians, Dec. 30.]\r\n\r\n[York and the Prussian contingent at Riga.]\r\n\r\nFour hundred thousand men were lost to a conqueror who could still stake\r\nthe lives of half a million more. The material power of Napoleon, though\r\nlargely, was not fatally diminished by the Russian campaign; it was through\r\nits moral effect, first proved in the action of Prussia, that the retreat\r\nfrom Moscow created a new order of things in Europe. The Prussian\r\ncontingent, commanded by General von York, lay in front of Riga, where it\r\nformed part of the French subsidiary army-corps led by Marshal Macdonald.\r\nEarly in November the Russian governor of Riga addressed himself to York,\r\nassuring him that Napoleon was ruined, and soliciting York himself to take\r\nup arms against Macdonald. [174] York had no evidence, beyond the word of\r\nthe Russian commander, of the extent of Napoleon's losses; and even if the\r\nfacts were as stated, it was by no means clear that the Czar might not be\r\ninclined to take vengeance on Prussia on account of its alliance with\r\nNapoleon. York returned a guarded answer to the Russian, and sent an\r\nofficer to Wilna to ascertain the real state of the French army. On the 8th\r\nof December the officer returned, and described what he had himself seen.\r\nSoon afterwards the Russian commandant produced a letter from the Czar,\r\ndeclaring his intention to deal with Prussia as a friend, not as an enemy.\r\nOn these points all doubt was removed; York's decision was thrown upon\r\nhimself. York was a rigid soldier of the old Prussian type, dominated by\r\nthe idea of military duty. The act to which the Russian commander invited\r\nhim, and which the younger officers were ready to hail as the liberation of\r\nPrussia, might be branded by his sovereign as desertion and treason.\r\nWhatever scruples and perplexity might be felt in such a situation by a\r\nloyal and obedient soldier were felt by York. He nevertheless chose the\r\ncourse which seemed to be for his country's good; and having chosen it, he\r\naccepted all the consequences which it involved. On the 30th of December a\r\nconvention was signed at Tauroggen, which, under the guise of a truce,\r\npractically withdrew the Prussian army from Napoleon, and gave the Russians\r\npossession of Königsberg. The momentous character of the act was recognised\r\nby Napoleon as soon as the news reached Paris. York's force was the\r\nstrongest military body upon the Russian frontier; united with Macdonald,\r\nit would have forced the Russian pursuit to stop at the Niemen; abandoning\r\nNapoleon, it brought his enemies on to the Vistula, and threatened\r\nincalculable danger by its example to all the rest of Germany. For the\r\nmoment, however, Napoleon could count upon the spiritless obedience of King\r\nFrederick William. In the midst of the French regiments that garrisoned\r\nBerlin, the King wrote orders pronouncing York's convention null and void,\r\nand ordering York himself to be tried by court-martial. The news reached\r\nthe loyal soldier: he received it with grief, but maintained his resolution\r\nto act for his country's good. \"With bleeding heart,\" he wrote, \"I burst\r\nthe bond of obedience, and carry on the war upon my own responsibility. The\r\narmy desires war with France; the nation desires it; the King himself\r\ndesires it, but his will is not free. The army must make his will free.\"\r\n\r\n[The Czar and Stein.]\r\n\r\n[Alexander enters Prussia, Jan., 1813.]\r\n\r\nYork's act was nothing less than the turning-point in Prussian history.\r\nAnother Prussian, at this great crisis of Europe, played as great, though\r\nnot so conspicuous, a part. Before the outbreak of the Russian war, the\r\nCzar had requested the exile Stein to come to St. Petersburg to aid him\r\nwith his counsels during the struggle with Napoleon. Stein gladly accepted\r\nthe call; and throughout the campaign he encouraged the Czar in the\r\nresolute resistance which the Russian nation itself required of its\r\nGovernment. So long as French soldiers remained on Russian soil, there was\r\nindeed little need for a foreigner to stimulate the Czar's energies; but\r\nwhen the pursuit had gloriously ended on the Niemen, the case became very\r\ndifferent. Kutusoff and the generals were disinclined to carry the war into\r\nGermany. The Russian army had itself lost three-fourths of its numbers;\r\nRussian honour was satisfied; the liberation of Western Europe might be\r\nleft to Western Europe itself. Among the politicians who surrounded\r\nAlexander, there were a considerable number, including the first minister\r\nRomanzoff, who still believed in the good policy of a French alliance.\r\nThese were the influences with which Stein had to contend, when the\r\nquestion arose whether Russia should rest satisfied with its own victories,\r\nor summon all Europe to unite in overthrowing Napoleon's tyranny. No record\r\nremains of the stages by which Alexander's mind rose to the clear and firm\r\nconception of a single European interest against Napoleon; indications\r\nexist that it was Stein's personal influence which most largely affected\r\nhis decision. Even in the darkest moments of the war, when the forces of\r\nRussia seemed wholly incapable of checking Napoleon's advance, Stein had\r\nnever abandoned his scheme for raising the German nation against Napoleon.\r\nThe confidence with which he had assured Alexander of ultimate victory over\r\nthe invader had been thoroughly justified; the triumph which he had\r\npredicted had come with a rapidity and completeness even surpassing his\r\nhopes. For a moment Alexander identified himself with the statesman who, in\r\nthe midst of Germany's humiliation, had been so resolute, so far-sighted,\r\nso aspiring. [175] The minister of the peace-party was dismissed: Alexander\r\nordered his troops to advance into Prussia, and charged Stein himself to\r\nassume the government of the Prussian districts occupied by Russian armies.\r\nStein's mission was to arm the Landwehr, and to gather all the resources of\r\nthe country for war against France; his powers were to continue until some\r\ndefinite arrangement should be made between the King of Prussia and the\r\nCzar.\r\n\r\n[Stein's commission from Alexander.]\r\n\r\n[Province of East Prussia arms, Jan., 1813.]\r\n\r\nArmed with this commission from a foreign sovereign, Stein appeared at\r\nKönigsberg on the 22nd of January, 1813, and published an order requiring\r\nthe governor of the province of East Prussia to convoke an assembly for the\r\npurpose of arming the people. Stein would have desired York to appear as\r\nPresident of the Assembly; but York, like most of the Prussian officials,\r\nwas alarmed and indignant at Stein's assumption of power in Prussia as the\r\nrepresentative of the Russian Czar, and hesitated to connect himself with\r\nso revolutionary a measure as the arming of the people. It was only upon\r\ncondition that Stein himself should not appear in the Assembly that York\r\nconsented to recognise its powers. The Assembly met. York entered the\r\nhouse, and spoke a few soul-stirring words. His undisguised declaration of\r\nwar with France was received with enthusiastic cheers. A plan for the\r\nformation of a Landwehr, based on Scharnhorst's plans of 1808, was laid\r\nbefore the Assembly, and accepted. Forty thousand men were called to arms\r\nin a province which included nothing west of the Vistula. The nation itself\r\nhad begun the war, and left its Government no choice but to follow. Stein's\r\ntask was fulfilled; and he retired to the quarters of Alexander, unwilling\r\nto mar by the appearance of foreign intervention the work to which the\r\nPrussian nation had now committed itself beyond power of recall. It was the\r\nfortune of the Prussian State, while its King dissembled before the French\r\nin Berlin, to possess a soldier brave enough to emancipate its army, and a\r\ncitizen bold enough to usurp the government of its provinces. Frederick\r\nWilliam forgave York his intrepidity; Stein's action was never forgiven by\r\nthe timid and jealous sovereign whose subjects he had summoned to arm\r\nthemselves for their country's deliverance.\r\n\r\n[Policy of Hardenberg.]\r\n\r\n[Treaty of Kalisch, Feb. 27.]\r\n\r\nThe Government of Berlin, which since the beginning of the Revolutionary\r\nWar had neither been able to fight, nor to deceive, nor to be honest, was\r\nat length forced by circumstances into a certain effectiveness in all three\r\nforms of action. In the interval between the first tidings of Napoleon's\r\ndisasters and the announcement of York's convention with the Russians,\r\nHardenberg had been assuring Napoleon of his devotion, and collecting\r\ntroops which he carefully prevented from joining him. [176] The desire of\r\nthe King was to gain concessions without taking part in the war either\r\nagainst Napoleon or on his side. When, however, the balance turned more\r\ndecidedly against Napoleon, he grew bolder; and the news of York's\r\ndefection, though it seriously embarrassed the Cabinet for the moment,\r\npractically decided it in favour of war with France. The messenger who was\r\nsent to remove York from his command received private instructions to fall\r\ninto the hands of the Russians, and to inform the Czar that, if his troops\r\nadvanced as far as the Oder, King Frederick William would be ready to\r\nconclude an alliance. Every post that arrived from East Prussia\r\nstrengthened the warlike resolutions of the Government. At length the King\r\nventured on the decisive step of quitting Berlin and placing himself at\r\nBreslau (Jan. 25). At Berlin he was in the power of the French; at Breslau\r\nhe was within easy reach of Alexander. The significance of the journey\r\ncould not be mistaken: it was immediately followed by open preparation for\r\nwar with France. On February 3rd there appeared an edict inviting\r\nvolunteers to enrol themselves: a week later all exemptions from military\r\nservice were abolished, and the entire male population of Prussia between\r\nthe ages of seventeen and twenty-four was declared liable to serve. General\r\nKnesebeck was sent to the headquarters of the Czar, which were now between\r\nWarsaw and Kalisch, to conclude a treaty of alliance. Knesebeck demanded\r\nsecurities for the restoration to Prussia of all the Polish territory which\r\nit had possessed before 1806; the Czar, unwilling either to grant this\r\ncondition or to lose the Prussian alliance, kept Knesebeck at his quarters,\r\nand sent Stein with a Russian plenipotentiary to Breslau to conclude the\r\ntreaty with Hardenberg himself. Stein and Hardenberg met at Breslau on the\r\n26th of February. Hardenberg accepted the Czar's terms, and the treaty,\r\nknown as the Treaty of Kalisch, [177] was signed on the following day. By\r\nthis treaty, without guaranteeing the restoration of Prussian Poland,\r\nRussia undertook not to lay down its arms until the Prussian State as a\r\nwhole was restored to the area and strength which it had possessed before\r\n1806. For this purpose annexations were promised in Northern Germany. With\r\nregard to Poland, Russia promised no more than to permit Prussia to retain\r\nwhat it had received in 1772, together with a strip of territory to connect\r\nthis district with Silesia. The meaning of the agreement was that Prussia\r\nshould abandon to Russia the greater part of its late Polish provinces, and\r\nreceive an equivalent German territory in its stead. The Treaty of Kalisch\r\nvirtually surrendered to the Czar all that Prussia had gained in the\r\npartitions of Poland made in 1793 and in 1795. The sacrifice was deemed a\r\nmost severe one by every Prussian politician, and was accepted only as a\r\nless evil than the loss of Russia's friendship, and a renewed submission to\r\nNapoleon. No single statesman, not even Stein himself, appears to have\r\nunderstood that in exchanging its Polish conquests for German annexations,\r\nin turning to the German west instead of to the alien Slavonic east,\r\nPrussia was in fact taking the very step which made it the possible head of\r\na future united Germany.\r\n\r\n[French retreat to the Elbe.]\r\n\r\nWar was still undeclared upon Napoleon by King Frederick William, but\r\nthroughout the month of February the light cavalry of the Russians pushed\r\nforward unhindered through Prussian territory towards the Oder, and crowds\r\nof volunteers, marching through Berlin on their way to the camps in\r\nSilesia, gave the French clear signs of the storm that was about to burst\r\nupon them. [178] The remnant of Napoleon's army, now commanded by Eugene\r\nBeauharnais, had fallen back step by step to the Oder. Here, resting on the\r\nfortresses, it might probably have checked the Russian advance; but the\r\nheart of Eugene failed; the line of the Oder was abandoned, and the retreat\r\ncontinued to Berlin and the Elbe. The Cossacks followed. On the 20th of\r\nFebruary they actually entered Berlin and fought with the French in the\r\nstreets. The French garrison was far superior in force; but the appearance\r\nof the Cossacks caused such a ferment that, although the alliance between\r\nFrance and Prussia was still in nominal existence, the French troops\r\nexpected to be cut to pieces by the people. For some days they continued to\r\nbivouac in the streets, and as soon as it became known that a regular\r\nRussian force had reached the Oder, Eugene determined to evacuate Berlin.\r\nOn the 4th of March the last French soldier quitted the Prussian capital.\r\nThe Cossacks rode through the town as the French left it, and fought with\r\ntheir rear-guard. Some days later Witgenstein appeared with Russian\r\ninfantry. On March 17th York made his triumphal entry at the head of his\r\ncorps, himself cold and rigid in the midst of tumultuous outbursts of\r\npatriotic joy.\r\n\r\n[King of Prussia declares war March 17.]\r\n\r\nIt was on this same day that King Frederick William issued his proclamation\r\nto the Prussian people, declaring that war had begun with France, and\r\nsummoning the nation to enter upon the struggle as one that must end either\r\nin victory or in total destruction. The proclamation was such as became a\r\nmonarch conscious that his own faint-heartedness had been the principal\r\ncause of Prussia's humiliation. It was simple and unboastful, admitting\r\nthat the King had made every effort to preserve the French alliance, and\r\nascribing the necessity for war to the intolerable wrongs inflicted by\r\nNapoleon in spite of Prussia's fulfilment of its treaty-obligations. The\r\nappeal to the great memories of Prussia's earlier sovereigns, and to the\r\nexample of Russia, Spain, and all countries which in present or in earlier\r\ntimes had fought for their independence against a stronger foe, was worthy\r\nof the truthful and modest tone in which the King spoke of the misfortunes\r\nof Prussia under his own rule.\r\n\r\n[Spirit of the Prussian nation.]\r\n\r\n[Idea of Germany unity.]\r\n\r\nBut no exhortations were necessary to fire the spirit of the Prussian\r\npeople. Seven years of suffering and humiliation had done their work. The\r\nold apathy of all classes had vanished under the pressure of a bitter sense\r\nof wrong. If among the Court party of Berlin and the Conservative\r\nlandowners there existed a secret dread of the awakening of popular forces,\r\nthe suspicion could not be now avowed. A movement as penetrating and as\r\nuniversal as that which France had experienced in 1792 swept through the\r\nPrussian State. It had required the experience of years of wretchedness,\r\nthe intrusion of the French soldier upon the peace of the family, the sight\r\nof the homestead swept bare of its stock to supply the invaders of Russia,\r\nthe memory of Schill's companions shot in cold blood for the cause of the\r\nFatherland, before the Prussian nation caught that flame which had\r\nspontaneously burst out in France, in Spain, and in Russia at the first\r\nshock of foreign aggression. But the passion of the Prussian people, if it\r\nhad taken long to kindle, was deep, steadfast, and rational. It was\r\nundisgraced by the frenzies of 1792, or by the religious fanaticism of the\r\nSpanish war of liberation; where religion entered into the struggle, it\r\nheightened the spirit of self-sacrifice rather than that of hatred to the\r\nenemy. Nor was it a thing of small moment to the future of Europe that in\r\nevery leading mind the cause of Prussia was identified with the cause of\r\nthe whole German race. The actual condition of Germany warranted no such\r\nconclusion, for Saxony, Bavaria, and the whole of the Rhenish Federation\r\nstill followed Napoleon: but the spirit and the ideas which became a living\r\nforce when at length the contest with Napoleon broke out were those of men\r\nlike Stein, who in the depths of Germany's humiliation had created the\r\nbright and noble image of a common Fatherland. It was no more given to\r\nStein to see his hopes fulfilled than it was given to Mirabeau to establish\r\nconstitutional liberty in France, or to the Italian patriots of 1797 to\r\ncreate a united Italy. A group of States where kings like Frederick William\r\nand Francis, ministers like Hardenberg and Metternich, governed millions of\r\npeople totally destitute of political instincts and training, was not to be\r\nsuddenly transformed into a free nation by the genius of an individual or\r\nthe patriotism of a single epoch. But if the work of German union was one\r\nwhich, even in the barren form of military empire, required the efforts of\r\ntwo more generations, the ideals of 1813 were no transient and ineffective\r\nfancy. Time was on the side of those who called the Prussian monarchy the\r\ntrue centre round which Germany could gather. If in the sequel Prussia was\r\nslow to recognise its own opportunities, the fault was less with patriots\r\nwho hoped too much than with kings and ministers who dared too little.\r\n\r\n[Formation of the Landwehr.]\r\n\r\nFor the moment, the measures of the Prussian Government were worthy of the\r\nspirit shown by the nation. Scharnhorst's military system had given Prussia\r\n100,000 trained soldiers ready to join the existing army of 45,000. The\r\nscheme for the formation of a Landwehr, though not yet carried into effect,\r\nneeded only to receive the sanction of the King. On the same day that\r\nFrederick William issued his proclamation to the people, he decreed the\r\nformation of the Landwehr and the Landsturm. The latter force, which was\r\nintended in case of necessity to imitate the peasant warfare of Spain and\r\nLa Vendée, had no occasion to act: the Landwehr, though its arming was\r\ndelayed by the poverty and exhaustion of the country, gradually became a\r\nmost formidable reserve, and sent its battalions to fight by the side of\r\nthe regulars in some of the greatest engagements in the war. It was the\r\nwant of arms and money, not of willing soldiers, that prevented Prussia\r\nfrom instantly attacking Napoleon with 200,000 men. The conscription was\r\nscarcely needed from the immense number of volunteers who joined the ranks.\r\nThough the completion of the Prussian armaments required some months more,\r\nPrussia did not need to stand upon the defensive. An army of 50,000 men was\r\nready to cross the Elbe immediately on the arrival of the Russians, and to\r\nopen the next campaign in the territory of Napoleon's allies of the Rhenish\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe War of Liberation--Blücher crosses the Elbe--Battle of Lützen--The\r\nAllies retreat to Silesia--Battle of Bautzen--Armistice--Napoleon intends\r\nto intimidate Austria--Mistaken as to the Forces of Austria--Metternich's\r\nPolicy--Treaty of Reichenbach--Austria offers its Mediation--Congress of\r\nPrague--Austria enters the War--Armies and Plans of Napoleon and the\r\nAllies--Campaign of August--Battles of Dresden, Grosbeeren, the Katzbach,\r\nand Kulm--Effect of these Actions--Battle of Dennewitz--German Policy of\r\nAustria favourable to the Princes of the Rhenish Confederacy--Frustrated\r\nHopes of German Unity--Battle of Leipzig--The Allies reach the Rhine--\r\nOffers of Peace at Frankfort--Plan of Invasion of France--Backwardness of\r\nAustria--The Allies enter France--Campaign of 1814--Congress of Châtillon--\r\nNapoleon moves to the rear of the Allies--The Allies advance on Paris--\r\nCapitulation of Paris--Entry of the Allies--Dethronement of Napoleon--\r\nRestoration of the Bourbons--The Charta--Treaty of Paris--Territorial\r\nEffects of the War, 1792-1814--Every Power except France had gained--France\r\nrelatively weaker in Europe--Summary of the Permanent Effects of this\r\nPeriod on Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Napoleon in 1813.]\r\n\r\nThe first three months of the year 1813 were spent by Napoleon in vigorous\r\npreparation for a campaign in Northern Germany. Immediately after receiving\r\nthe news of York's convention with the Russians he had ordered a levy of\r\n350,000 men. It was in vain that Frederick William and Hardenberg affected\r\nto disavow the general as a traitor; Napoleon divined the national\r\ncharacter of York's act, and laid his account for a war against the\r\ncombined forces of Prussia and Russia. In spite of the catastrophe of the\r\nlast campaign, Napoleon was still stronger than his enemies. Italy and the\r\nRhenish Federation had never wavered in their allegiance; Austria, though a\r\ncold ally, had at least shown no signs of hostility. The resources of an\r\nempire of forty million inhabitants were still at Napoleon's command. It\r\nwas in the youth and inexperience of the new soldiers, and in the scarcity\r\nof good officers, [179] that the losses of the previous year showed their\r\nmost visible effect. Lads of seventeen, commanded in great part by officers\r\nwho had never been through a campaign, took the place of the soldiers who\r\nhad fought at Friedland and Wagram. They were as brave as their\r\npredecessors, but they failed in bodily strength and endurance. Against\r\nthem came the remnant of the men who had pursued Napoleon from Moscow, and\r\na Prussian army which was but the vanguard of an armed nation.\r\nNevertheless, Napoleon had no cause to expect defeat, provided that Austria\r\nremained on his side. Though the Prussian nation entered upon the conflict\r\nin the most determined spirit, a war on the Elbe against Russia and Prussia\r\ncombined was a less desperate venture than a war with Russia alone beyond\r\nthe Niemen.\r\n\r\n[Blücher crosses the Elbe, March, 1813.]\r\n\r\nWhen King Frederick William published his declaration of war (March 17),\r\nthe army of Eugène had already fallen back as far west as Magdeburg,\r\nleaving garrisons in most of the fortresses between the Elbe and the\r\nRussian frontier. Napoleon was massing troops on the Main, and preparing\r\nfor an advance in force, when the Prussians, commanded by Blücher, and some\r\nweak divisions of the Russian army, pushed forward to the Elbe. On the 18th\r\nof March the Cossacks appeared in the suburbs of Dresden, on the right bank\r\nof the river. Davoust, who was in command of the French garrison, blew up\r\ntwo arches of the bridge, and retired to Magdeburg: Blücher soon afterwards\r\nentered Dresden, and called upon the Saxon nation to rise against Napoleon.\r\nBut he spoke to deaf ears. The common people were indifferent; the\r\nofficials waited to see which side would conquer. Blücher could scarcely\r\nobtain provisions for his army; he passed on westwards, and came into the\r\nneighbourhood of Leipzig. Here he found himself forced to halt, and to wait\r\nfor his allies. Though a detachment of the Russian army under Witgenstein\r\nhad already crossed the Elbe, the main army, with Kutusoff, was still\r\nlingering at Kalisch on the Polish frontier, where it had arrived six weeks\r\nbefore. As yet the Prussians had only 50,000 men ready for action; until\r\nthe Russians came up, it was unsafe to advance far beyond the Elbe. Blücher\r\ncounted every moment lost that kept him from battle: the Russian\r\ncommander-in-chief, sated with glory and sinking beneath the infirmities of\r\na veteran, could scarcely be induced to sign an order of march. At length\r\nKutusoff's illness placed the command in younger hands. His strength failed\r\nhim during the march from Poland; he was left dying in Silesia; and on the\r\n24th of April the Czar and the King of Prussia led forward his veteran\r\ntroops into Dresden.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon enters Dresden, May 14.]\r\n\r\n[Battle of Lützen, May 2.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon was now known to be approaching with considerable force by the\r\nroads of the Saale. A pitched battle west of the Elbe was necessary before\r\nthe Allies could hope to win over any of the States of the Rhenish\r\nConfederacy; the flat country beyond Leipzig offered the best possible\r\nfield for cavalry, in which the Allies were strong and Napoleon extremely\r\ndeficient. It was accordingly determined to unite all the divisions of the\r\narmy with Blücher on the west of Leipzig, and to attack the French as soon\r\nas they descended from the hilly country of the Saale, and began their\r\nmarch across the Saxon plain. The Allies took post at Lützen: the French\r\nadvanced, and at midday on the 2nd of May the battle of Lützen began. Till\r\nevening, victory inclined to the Allies. The Prussian soldiery fought with\r\nthe utmost spirit; for the first time in Napoleon's campaigns, the French\r\ninfantry proved weaker than an enemy when fighting against them in equal\r\nnumbers. But the generalship of Napoleon turned the scale. Seventy thousand\r\nof the French were thrown upon fifty thousand of the Allies; the battle was\r\nfought in village streets and gardens, where cavalry were useless; and at\r\nthe close of the day, though the losses on each side were equal, the Allies\r\nwere forced from the positions which they had gained. Such a result was\r\nequivalent to a lost battle. Napoleon's junction with the army of Eugène at\r\nMagdeburg was now inevitable, unless a second engagement was fought and\r\nwon. No course remained to the Allies but to stake everything upon a\r\nrenewed attack, or to retire behind the Elbe and meet the reinforcements\r\nassembling in Silesia. King Frederick William declared for a second battle;\r\n[180] he was over-ruled, and the retreat commenced. Napoleon entered\r\nDresden on May 14th. No attempt was made by the Allies to hold the line of\r\nthe Elbe; all the sanguine hopes with which Blücher and his comrades had\r\nadvanced to attack Napoleon within the borders of the Rhenish Confederacy\r\nwere dashed to the ground. The Fatherland remained divided against itself.\r\nSaxony and the rest of the vassal States were secured to France by the\r\nvictory of Lützen; the liberation of Germany was only to be wrought by\r\nprolonged and obstinate warfare, and by the wholesale sacrifice of Prussian\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n[Armistice, June 4.]\r\n\r\n[Battle of Bautzen, May 21.]\r\n\r\nIt was with deep disappointment, but not with any wavering of purpose, that\r\nthe allied generals fell back before Napoleon towards the Silesian\r\nfortresses. The Prussian troops which had hitherto taken part in the war\r\nwere not the third part of those which the Government was arming; new\r\nRussian divisions were on the march from Poland. As the Allies moved\r\neastwards from the Elbe, both their own forces and those of Napoleon\r\ngathered strength. The retreat stopped at Bautzen, on the river Spree; and\r\nhere, on the 19th of May, 90,000 of the Allies and the same number of the\r\nFrench drew up in order of battle. The Allies held a long, broken chain of\r\nhills behind the river, and the ground lying between these hills and the\r\nvillage of Bautzen. On the 20th the French began the attack, and won the\r\npassage of the river. In spite of the approach of Ney with 40,000 more\r\ntroops, the Czar and the King of Prussia determined to continue the battle\r\non the following day. The struggle of the 21st was of the same obstinate\r\nand indecisive character as that at Lützen. Twenty-five thousand French had\r\nbeen killed or wounded before the day was over, but the bad generalship of\r\nthe Allies had again given Napoleon the victory. The Prussian and Russian\r\ncommanders were all at variance; Alexander, who had to decide in their\r\ncontentions, possessed no real military faculty. It was not for want of\r\nbrave fighting and steadfastness before the enemy that Bautzen was lost.\r\nThe Allies retreated in perfect order, and without the loss of a single\r\ngun. Napoleon followed, forcing his wearied regiments to ceaseless\r\nexertion, in the hope of ruining by pursuit an enemy whom he could not\r\noverthrow in battle. In a few more days the discord of the allied generals\r\nand the sufferings of the troops would probably have made them unable to\r\nresist Napoleon's army, weakened as it was. But the conqueror himself\r\nhalted in the moment of victory. On the 4th of June an armistice of seven\r\nweeks arrested the pursuit, and brought the first act of the War of\r\nLiberation to a close.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon and Austria.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon's motive for granting this interval to his enemies, the most fatal\r\nstep in his whole career, has been vaguely sought among the general reasons\r\nfor military delay; as a matter of fact, Napoleon was thinking neither of\r\nthe condition of his own army nor of that of the Allies when he broke off\r\nhostilities, but of the probable action of the Court of Vienna. [181] \"I\r\nshall grant a truce,\" he wrote to the Viceroy of Italy (June 2, 1813), \"on\r\naccount of the armaments of Austria, and in order to gain time to bring up\r\nthe Italian army to Laibach to threaten Vienna.\" Austria had indeed\r\nresolved to regain, either by war or negotiation, the provinces which it\r\nhad lost in 1809. It was now preparing to offer its mediation, but it was\r\nalso preparing to join the Allies in case Napoleon rejected its demands.\r\nMetternich was anxious to attain his object, if possible, without war. The\r\nAustrian State was bankrupt; its army had greatly deteriorated since 1809;\r\nMetternich himself dreaded both the ambition of Russia and what he\r\nconsidered the revolutionary schemes of the German patriots. It was his\r\nobject not to drive Napoleon from his throne, but to establish a European\r\nsystem in which neither France nor Russia should be absolutely dominant.\r\nSoon after the retreat from Moscow the Cabinet of Vienna had informed\r\nNapoleon, though in the most friendly terms, that Austria could not longer\r\nremain in the position of a dependent ally. [182] Metternich stated, and\r\nnot insincerely, that by certain concessions Napoleon might still count on\r\nAustria's friendship; but at the same time he negotiated with the allied\r\nPowers, and encouraged them to believe that Austria would, under certain\r\ncircumstances, strike on their behalf. The course of the campaign of May\r\nwas singularly favourable to Metternich's policy. Napoleon had not won a\r\ndecided victory; the Allies, on the other hand, were so far from success\r\nthat Austria could set almost any price it pleased upon its alliance. By\r\nthe beginning of June it had become a settled matter in the Austrian\r\nCabinet that Napoleon must be made to resign the Illyrian Provinces\r\nconquered in 1809 and the districts of North Germany annexed in 1810; but\r\nit was still the hope of the Government to obtain this result by peaceful\r\nmeans. Napoleon saw that Austria was about to change its attitude, but he\r\nhad by no means penetrated the real intentions of Metternich. He credited\r\nthe Viennese Government with a stronger sentiment of hostility towards\r\nhimself than it actually possessed; at the same time he failed to\r\nappreciate the fixed and settled character of its purpose. He believed that\r\nthe action of Austria would depend simply upon the means which he possessed\r\nto intimidate it; that, if the army of Italy were absent, Austria would\r\nattack him; that, on the other hand, if he could gain time to bring the\r\narmy of Italy into Carniola, Austria would keep the peace. It was with this\r\nbelief, and solely for the purpose of bringing up a force to menace\r\nAustria, that Napoleon stayed his hand against the Prussian and Russian\r\narmies after the battle of Bautzen, and gave time for the gathering of the\r\nimmense forces which were destined to effect his destruction.\r\n\r\n[Metternich offers Austria's mediation.]\r\n\r\nImmediately after the conclusion of the armistice of June 4th, Metternich\r\ninvited Napoleon to accept Austria's mediation for a general peace. The\r\nsettlement which Metternich contemplated was a very different one from that\r\non which Stein and the Prussian patriots had set their hopes. Austria was\r\nwilling to leave to Napoleon the whole of Italy and Holland, the frontier\r\nof the Rhine, and the Protectorate of Western Germany: all that was\r\nrequired by Metternich, as arbiter of Europe, was the restoration of the\r\nprovinces taken from Austria after the war of 1809, the reinstatement of\r\nPrussia in Western Poland, and the abandonment by France of the\r\nNorth-German district annexed in 1810. But to Napoleon the greater or less\r\nextent of the concessions asked by Austria was a matter of no moment. He\r\nwas determined to make no concessions at all, and he entered into\r\nnegotiations only for the purpose of disguising from Austria the real\r\nobject with which he had granted the armistice. While Napoleon affected to\r\nbe weighing the proposals of Austria, he was in fact calculating the number\r\nof marches which would place the Italian army on the Austrian frontier;\r\nthis once effected, he expected to hear nothing more of Metternich's\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon deceived as to the forces of Austria.]\r\n\r\nIt was a game of deceit; but there was no one who was so thoroughly\r\ndeceived as Napoleon himself. By some extraordinary miscalculation on\r\nthe part of his secret agents, he was led to believe that the whole\r\nforce of Austria, both in the north and the south, amounted to only\r\n100,000 men, [183] and it was on this estimate that he had formed his\r\nplans of intimidation. In reality Austria had double that number of men\r\nready to take the field. By degrees Napoleon saw reason to suspect\r\nhimself in error. On the 11th of July he wrote to his Foreign Minister,\r\nMaret, bitterly reproaching him with the failure of the secret service\r\nto gain any trustworthy information. It was not too late to accept\r\nMetternich's terms. Yet even now, when the design of intimidating\r\nAustria had proved an utter delusion, and Napoleon was convinced that\r\nAustria would fight, and fight with very powerful forces, his pride and\r\nhis invincible belief in his own superiority prevented him from drawing\r\nback. He made an attempt to enter upon a separate negotiation with\r\nRussia, and, when this failed, he resolved to face the conflict with\r\nthe whole of Europe.\r\n\r\n[Treaty of Reichenbach, June 27.]\r\n\r\nThere was no longer any uncertainty among Napoleon's enemies. On the 27th\r\nof June, Austria had signed a treaty at Reichenbach, pledging itself to\r\njoin the allied Powers in the event of Napoleon rejecting the conditions to\r\nbe proposed by Austria as mediator; and the conditions so to be proposed\r\nwere fixed by the same treaty. They were the following:--The suppression of\r\nthe Duchy of Warsaw; the restoration to Austria of the Illyrian Provinces;\r\nand the surrender by Napoleon of the North-German district annexed to his\r\nEmpire in 1810. Terms more hostile to France than these Austria declined to\r\nembody in its mediation. The Elbe might still sever Prussia from its German\r\nprovinces lost in 1807; Napoleon might still retain, as chief of the\r\nRhenish Confederacy, his sovereignty over the greater part of the German\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n[Austria enters the war, Aug. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Congress of Prague, July 15-Aug. 10.]\r\n\r\nFrom the moment when these conditions were fixed, there was nothing which\r\nthe Prussian generals so much dreaded as that Napoleon might accept them,\r\nand so rob the Allies of the chance of crushing him by means of Austria's\r\nsupport. But their fears were groundless. The counsels of Napoleon were\r\nexactly those which his worst enemies would have desired him to adopt. War,\r\nand nothing but war, was his fixed resolve. He affected to entertain\r\nAustria's propositions, and sent his envoy Caulaincourt to a Congress which\r\nAustria summoned at Prague; but it was only for the purpose of gaining a\r\nfew more weeks of preparation. The Congress met; the armistice was\r\nprolonged to the 10th of August. Caulaincourt, however, was given no power\r\nto close with Austria's demands. He was ignorant that he had only been sent\r\nto Prague in order to gain time. He saw the storm gathering: unable to\r\nbelieve that Napoleon intended to fight all Europe rather than make the\r\nconcessions demanded of him, he imagined that his master still felt some\r\ndoubt whether Austria and the other Powers meant to adhere to their word.\r\nAs the day drew nigh which closed the armistice and the period given for a\r\nreply to Austria's ultimatum, Caulaincourt implored Napoleon not to deceive\r\nhimself with hopes that Austria would draw back. Napoleon had no such hope;\r\nhe knew well that Austria would declare war, and he accepted the issue.\r\nCaulaincourt heard nothing more. At midnight on the 10th of August the\r\nCongress declared itself dissolved. Before the dawn of the next morning the\r\narmy in Silesia saw the blaze of the beacon-fires which told that\r\nnegotiation was at an end, and that Austria was entering the war on the\r\nside of the Allies. [184]\r\n\r\n[Armies of Napoleon and the Allies.]\r\n\r\nSeven days' notice was necessary before the commencement of actual\r\nhostilities. Napoleon, himself stationed at Dresden, held all the lower\r\ncourse of the Elbe; and his generals had long had orders to be ready to\r\nmarch on the morning of the 18th. Forces had come up from all parts of the\r\nEmpire, raising the French army at the front to 300,000 men; but, for the\r\nfirst time in Napoleon's career, his enemies had won from a pause in war\r\nresults even surpassing his own. The strength of the Prussian and Russian\r\narmies was now enormously different from what it had been at Lützen and\r\nBautzen. The Prussian Landwehr, then a weaponless and ill-clad militia\r\ndrilling in the villages, was now fully armed, and in great part at the\r\nfront. New Russian divisions had reached Silesia. Austria took the field\r\nwith a force as numerous as that which had checked Napoleon in 1809. At the\r\nclose of the armistice, 350,000 men actually faced the French positions\r\nupon the Elbe; 300,000 more were on the march, or watching the German\r\nfortresses and the frontier of Italy. The allied troops operating against\r\nNapoleon were divided into three armies. In the north, between Wittenberg\r\nand Berlin, Bernadotte commanded 60,000 Russians and Prussians, in addition\r\nto his own Swedish contingent. Blücher was placed at the head of 100,000\r\nRussians and Prussians in Silesia. The Austrians remained undivided, and\r\nformed, together with some Russian and Prussian divisions, the great army\r\nof Bohemia, 200,000 strong, under the command of Schwarzenberg. The plan of\r\nthe campaign had been agreed upon by the Allies soon after the Treaty of\r\nReichenbach had been made with Austria. It was a sound, though not a daring\r\none.\r\n\r\n[Plan of the Allies.]\r\n\r\nThe three armies, now forming an arc from Wittenberg to the north of\r\nBohemia, were to converge upon the line of Napoleon's communications behind\r\nDresden; if separately attacked, their generals were to avoid all hazardous\r\nengagements, and to manoeuvre so as to weary the enemy and preserve their\r\nown general relations, as far as possible, unchanged. Blücher, as the most\r\nexposed, was expected to content himself the longest with the defensive;\r\nthe great army of Bohemia, after securing the mountain-passes between\r\nBohemia and Saxony, might safely turn Napoleon's position at Dresden, and\r\nso draw the two weaker armies towards it for one vast and combined\r\nengagement in the plain of Leipzig.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon's plan of attack.]\r\n\r\nIn outline, the plan of the Allies was that which Napoleon expected them to\r\nadopt. His own design was to anticipate it by an offensive of extraordinary\r\nsuddenness and effect. Hostilities could not begin before the morning of\r\nthe 18th of August; by the 21st or the 22nd, Napoleon calculated that he\r\nshould have captured Berlin. Oudinot, who was at Wittenberg with 80,000\r\nmen, had received orders to advance upon the Prussian capital at the moment\r\nthat the armistice expired, and to force it, if necessary by bombardment,\r\ninto immediate surrender. The effect of this blow, as Napoleon supposed,\r\nwould be to disperse the entire reserve-force of the Prussian monarchy, and\r\nparalyse the action of its army in the field. While Oudinot marched on\r\nBerlin, Blücher was to be attacked in Silesia, and prevented from rendering\r\nany assistance either on the north or on the south. The mass of Napoleon's\r\nforces, centred at Dresden, and keeping watch upon the movements of the\r\narmy of Bohemia, would either fight a great battle, or, if the Allies made\r\na false movement, march straight upon Prague, the centre of Austria's\r\nsupplies, and reach it before the enemy. All the daring imagination of\r\nNapoleon's earlier campaigns displayed itself in such a project, which, if\r\nsuccessful, would have terminated the war within ten days; but this\r\nimagination was no longer, as in those earlier campaigns, identical with\r\ninsight into real possibilities. The success of Napoleon's plan involved\r\nthe surprise or total defeat of Bernadotte before Berlin, the disablement\r\nof Blücher, and a victory, or a strategical success equivalent to a\r\nvictory, over the vast army of the south. It demanded of a soldiery,\r\ninferior to the enemy in numerical strength, the personal superiority which\r\nhad belonged to the men of Jena and Austerlitz, when in fact the French\r\nregiments of conscripts had ceased to be a match for equal numbers of the\r\nenemy. But no experience could alter Napoleon's fixed belief in the fatuity\r\nof all warfare except his own. After the havoc of Borodino, after the even\r\nstruggles of Lützen and Bautzen, he still reasoned as if he had before him\r\nthe armies of Brunswick and Mack. His plan assumed the certainty of success\r\nin each of its parts; for the failure of a single operation hazarded all\r\nthe rest, by requiring the transfer of reinforcements from armies already\r\ntoo weak for the tasks assigned to them. Nevertheless, the utmost that\r\nNapoleon would acknowledge was that the execution of his design needed\r\nenergy. He still underrated the force which Austria had brought into the\r\nfield against him. Though ignorant of the real position and strength of the\r\narmy in Bohemia, and compelled to wait for the enemy's movements before\r\nstriking on this side, he already in imagination saw the war decided by the\r\nfall of the Prussian capital.\r\n\r\n[Triple movement, Aug. 18-26.]\r\n\r\n[Battle of Dresden, Aug. 26, 27.]\r\n\r\n[Battles of Grossbeeren, Aug. 23, and the Katzbach, Aug. 26.]\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of August the forward movement began. Oudinot advanced from\r\nWittenberg towards Berlin; Napoleon himself hurried into Silesia, intending\r\nto deal Blücher one heavy blow, and instantly to return and place himself\r\nbefore Schwarzenberg. On the 21st, and following days, the Prussian general\r\nwas attacked and driven eastwards. Napoleon committed the pursuit to\r\nMacdonald, and hastened back to Dresden, already threatened by the advance\r\nof the Austrians from Bohemia. Schwarzenberg and the allied sovereigns, as\r\nsoon as they heard that Napoleon had gone to seek Blücher in Silesia, had\r\nin fact abandoned their cautious plans, and determined to make an assault\r\nupon Dresden with the Bohemian army alone. But it was in vain that they\r\ntried to surprise Napoleon. He was back at Dresden on the 25th, and ready\r\nfor the attack. Never were Napoleon's hopes higher than on this day. His\r\nsuccess in Silesia had filled him with confidence. He imagined Oudinot to\r\nbe already in Berlin; and the advance of Schwarzenberg against Dresden gave\r\nhim the very opportunity which he desired for crushing the Bohemian army in\r\none great battle, before it could draw support either from Blücher or from\r\nBernadotte. Another Austerlitz seemed to be at hand. Napoleon wrote to\r\nParis that he should be in Prague before the enemy; and, while he completed\r\nhis defences in front of Dresden, he ordered Vandamme, with 40,000 men, to\r\ncross the Elbe at Königstein, and force his way south-westwards on to the\r\nroads into Bohemia, in the rear of the Great Army, in order to destroy its\r\nmagazines and menace its line of retreat on Prague. On August 26th\r\nSchwarzenberg's host assailed the positions of Napoleon on the slopes and\r\ngardens outside Dresden. Austrians, Russians, and Prussians all took part\r\nin the attack. Moreau, the victor of Hohenlinden, stood by the side of the\r\nEmperor Alexander, whom he had come to help against his own countrymen. He\r\nlived only to witness one of the last and greatest victories of France. The\r\nattack was everywhere repelled: the Austrian divisions were not only\r\nbeaten, but disgraced and overthrown. At the end of two days' fighting the\r\nAllies were in full retreat, leaving 20,000 prisoners in the hands of\r\nNapoleon. It was a moment when the hearts of the bravest sank, and when\r\nhope itself might well vanish, as the rumour passed through the Prussian\r\nregiments that Metternich was again in friendly communication with\r\nNapoleon. But in the midst of Napoleon's triumph intelligence arrived which\r\nrobbed it of all its worth. Oudinot, instead of conquering Berlin, had been\r\ndefeated by the Prussians of Bernadotte's army at Grossbeeren (Aug. 23),\r\nand driven back upon the Elbe. Blücher had turned upon Macdonald in\r\nSilesia, and completely overthrown his army on the river Katzbach, at the\r\nvery moment when the Allies were making their assault upon Dresden. It was\r\nvain to think of a march upon Prague, or of the annihilation of the\r\nAustrians, when on the north and the east Napoleon's troops were meeting\r\nwith nothing but disaster. The divisions which had been intended to support\r\nVandamme's movement from Königstein upon the rear of the Great Army were\r\nretained in the neighbourhood of Dresden, in order to be within reach of\r\nthe points where their aid might be needed. Vandamme, ignorant of his\r\nisolation, was left with scarcely 40,000 men to encounter the Great Army in\r\nits retreat.\r\n\r\n[Battle of Kulm, Aug. 29, 30.]\r\n\r\nHe threw himself upon a Russian corps at Kulm, in the Bohemian mountains,\r\non the morning of the 29th. The Russians, at first few in number, held\r\ntheir ground during the day; in the night, and after the battle had\r\nrecommenced on the morrow, vast masses of the allied troops poured in. The\r\nFrench fought desperately, but were overwhelmed. Vandamme himself was made\r\nprisoner, with 10,000 of his men. The whole of the stores and most of the\r\ncannon of his army remained in the enemy's hands.\r\n\r\n[Effect of the twelve days, Aug. 18-30.]\r\n\r\n[Battle of Dennewitz, Sept. 6.]\r\n\r\nThe victory at Kulm secured the Bohemian army from pursuit, and almost\r\nextinguished the effects of its defeat at Dresden. Thanks to the successes\r\nof Blücher and of Bernadotte's Prussian generals, which prevented Napoleon\r\nfrom throwing all his forces on to the rear of the Great Army,\r\nSchwarzenberg's rash attack had proved of no worse significance than an\r\nunsuccessful raid. The Austrians were again in the situation assigned to\r\nthem in the original plan of the campaign, and capable of resuming their\r\nadvance into the interior of Saxony: Blücher and the northern commanders\r\nhad not only escaped separate destruction, but won great victories over the\r\nFrench: Napoleon, weakened by the loss of 100,000 men, remained exactly\r\nwhere he had been at the beginning of the campaign. Had the triple movement\r\nby which he meant to overwhelm his adversaries been capable of execution,\r\nit would now have been fully executed. The balance, however, had turned\r\nagainst Napoleon; and the twelve days from the 18th to the 29th of August,\r\nthough marked by no catastrophe like Leipzig or Waterloo, were in fact the\r\ndecisive period in the struggle of Europe against Napoleon. The attack by\r\nwhich he intended to prevent the junction of the three armies had been\r\nmade, and had failed. Nothing now remained for him but to repeat the same\r\nmovements with a discouraged force against an emboldened enemy, or to quit\r\nthe line of the Elbe, and prepare for one vast and decisive encounter with\r\nall three armies combined. Napoleon drove from his mind the thought of\r\nfailure; he ordered Ney to take command of Oudinot's army, and to lead it\r\nagain, in increased strength, upon Berlin; he himself hastened to\r\nMacdonald's beaten troops in Silesia, and rallied them for a new assault\r\nupon Blücher. All was in vain. Ney, advancing on Berlin, was met by the\r\nPrussian general Billow at Dennewitz, and totally routed (Sept. 6):\r\nBlücher, finding that Napoleon himself was before him, skilfully avoided\r\nbattle, and forced his adversary to waste in fruitless marches the brief\r\ninterval which he had snatched from his watch on Schwarzenberg. Each conflict\r\nwith the enemy, each vain and exhausting march, told that the superiority\r\nhad passed from the French to their foes, and that Napoleon's retreat was\r\nnow only a matter of time. \"These creatures have learnt something,\" said\r\nNapoleon in the bitterness of his heart, as he saw the columns of Blücher\r\nmanoeuvring out of his grasp. Ney's report of his own overthrow at\r\nDennewitz sounded like an omen of the ruin of Waterloo. \"I have been\r\ntotally defeated,\" he wrote, \"and do not yet know whether my army has\r\nre-assembled. The spirit of the generals and officers is shattered. To\r\ncommand in such conditions is but half to command. I had rather be a common\r\ngrenadier.\"\r\n\r\n[Metternich.]\r\n\r\n[German policy of Stein and of Austria.]\r\n\r\nThe accession of Austria had turned the scale in favour of the Allies; it\r\nrested only with the allied generals themselves to terminate the warfare\r\nround Dresden, and to lead their armies into the heart of Saxony. For a\r\nwhile the course of the war flagged, and military interests gave place to\r\npolitical. It was in the interval between the first great battles and the\r\nfinal advance on Leipzig that the future of Germany was fixed by the three\r\nallied Powers. In the excitement of the last twelve months little thought\r\nhad been given, except by Stein and his friends, to the political form to\r\nbe set in the place of the Napoleonic Federation of the Rhine. Stein, in\r\nthe midst of the Russian campaign, had hoped for a universal rising of the\r\nGerman people against Napoleon, and had proposed the dethronement of all\r\nthe German princes who supported his cause. His policy had received the\r\ngeneral approval of Alexander, and, on the entrance of the Russian army\r\ninto Germany, a manifesto had been issued appealing to the whole German\r\nnation, and warning the vassals of Napoleon that they could only save\r\nthemselves by submission. [185] A committee had been appointed by the\r\nallied sovereigns, under the presidency of Stein himself, to administer the\r\nrevenues of all Confederate territory that should be occupied by the allied\r\narmies. Whether the reigning Houses should be actually expelled might\r\nremain in uncertainty; but it was the fixed hope of Stein and his friends\r\nthat those princes who were permitted to retain their thrones would be\r\npermitted to retain them only as officers in a great German Empire, without\r\nsovereign rights either over their own subjects or in relation to foreign\r\nStates. The Kings of Bavaria and Würtemberg had gained their titles and\r\nmuch of their despotic power at home from Napoleon; their independence of\r\nthe Head of Germany had made them nothing more than the instruments of a\r\nforeign conqueror. Under whatever form the central authority might be\r\nrevived, Stein desired that it should be the true and only sovereign Power\r\nin Germany, a Power to which every German might appeal against the\r\noppression of a minor Government, and in which the whole nation should find\r\nits representative before the rest of Europe. In the face of such a central\r\nauthority, whether an elected Parliament or an Imperial Council, the minor\r\nprinces could at best retain but a fragment of their powers; and such was\r\nthe theory accepted at the allied head-quarters down to the time when\r\nAustria proffered its mediation and support. Then everything changed. The\r\nviews of the Austrian Government upon the future system of Germany were in\r\ndirect opposition to those of Stein's party. Metternich dreaded the thought\r\nof popular agitation, and looked upon Stein, with his idea of a National\r\nParliament and his plans for dethroning the Rhenish princes, as little\r\nbetter than the Jacobins of 1792. The offer of a restored imperial dignity\r\nin Germany was declined by the Emperor of Austria at the instance of his\r\nMinister. With characteristic sense of present difficulties, and blindness\r\nto the great forces which really contained their solution, Metternich\r\nargued that the minor princes would only be driven into the arms of the\r\nforeigner by the establishment of any supreme German Power. They would\r\nprobably desert Napoleon if the Allies guaranteed to them everything that\r\nthey at present possessed; they would be freed from all future temptation\r\nto attach themselves to France if Austria contented itself with a\r\ndiplomatic influence and with the ties of a well-constructed system of\r\ntreaties. In spite of the influence of Stein with the Emperor Alexander,\r\nMetternich's views prevailed. Austria had so deliberately kept itself in\r\nbalance during the first part of the year 1813, that the Allies were now\r\nwilling to concede everything, both in this matter and in others, in return\r\nfor its support. Nothing more was heard of the dethronement of the\r\nConfederate princes, or even of the limitation of their powers. It was\r\nagreed by the Treaty of Teplitz, signed by Prussia, Russia, and Austria on\r\nSeptember 9th, that every State of the Rhenish Confederacy should be placed\r\nin a position of absolute independence. Negotiations were opened with the\r\nKing of Bavaria, whose army had steadily fought on the side of Napoleon in\r\nevery campaign since 1806. Instead of being outlawed as a criminal, he was\r\nwelcomed as an ally. The Treaty of Ried, signed on the 3rd of October,\r\nguaranteed to the King of Bavaria, in return for his desertion of Napoleon,\r\nfull sovereign rights, and the whole of the territory which he had received\r\nfrom Napoleon, except the Tyrol and the Austrian district on the Inn. What\r\nhad been accorded to the King of Bavaria could not be refused to the rest\r\nof Napoleon's vassals who were willing to make their peace with the Allies\r\nin time. Germany was thus left at the mercy of a score of petty Cabinets.\r\nIt was seen by the patriotic party in Prussia at what price the alliance of\r\nAustria had been purchased. Austria had indeed made it possible to conquer\r\nNapoleon, but it had also made an end of all prospect of the union of the\r\nGerman nation.\r\n\r\n[Allies cross the Elbe, Oct. 3.]\r\n\r\nTill the last days of September the position of the hostile armies round\r\nDresden remained little changed, Napoleon unweariedly repeated his attacks,\r\nnow on one side, now on another, but without result. The Allies on their\r\npart seemed rooted to the soil. Bernadotte, balanced between the desire to\r\nobtain Norway from the Allies and a foolish hope of being called to the\r\nthrone of France, was bent on doing the French as little harm as possible;\r\nSchwarzenberg, himself an indifferent general, was distracted by the\r\ncouncillors of all the three monarchs; Blücher alone pressed for decided\r\nand rapid action. At length the Prussian commander gained permission to\r\nmarch northwards, and unite his army with Bernadotte's in a forward\r\nmovement across the Elbe. The long-expected Russian reserves, led by\r\nBennigsen, reached the Bohemian mountains; and at the beginning of October\r\nthe operation began which was to collect the whole of the allied forces in\r\nthe plain of Leipzig. Blücher forced the passage of the Elbe at Wartenburg.\r\nIt was not until Napoleon learnt that the army of Silesia had actually\r\ncrossed the river that he finally quitted Dresden. Then, hastening\r\nnorthwards, he threw himself upon the Prussian general; but Blücher again\r\navoided battle, as he had done in Silesia; and on the 7th of October his\r\narmy united with Bernadotte's, which had crossed the Elbe two days before.\r\n\r\nThe enemy was closing in upon Napoleon. Obstinately as he had held on to\r\nthe line of the Elbe, he could hold on no longer. In the frustration of all\r\nhis hopes there flashed across his mind the wild project of a march\r\neastwards to the Oder, and the gathering of all the besieged garrisons for\r\na campaign in which the enemy should stand between himself and France; but\r\nthe dream lasted only long enough to gain a record. Napoleon ventured no\r\nmore than to send a corps back to the Elbe to threaten Berlin, in the hope\r\nof tempting Blücher and Bernadotte to abandon the advance which they had\r\nnow begun in co-operation with the great army of Schwarzenberg. From the\r\n10th to the 14th of October, Napoleon lingered at Düben, between Dresden and\r\nLeipzig, restlessly expecting to hear of Blücher's or Bernadotte's retreat.\r\nThe only definite information that he could gain was that Schwarzenberg was\r\npressing on towards the west. At length he fell back to Leipzig, believing\r\nthat Blücher, but not Bernadotte, was advancing to meet Schwarzenberg and\r\ntake part in a great engagement. As he entered Leipzig on October 14th the\r\ncannon of Schwarzenberg was heard on the south.\r\n\r\n[Battle of Leipzig. Oct 16-19.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon drew up for battle. The number of his troops in position around\r\nthe city was 170,000: about 15,000 others lay within call. He placed\r\nMarmont and Ney on the north of Leipzig at the village of Möckern, to meet\r\nthe expected onslaught of Blücher; and himself, with the great mass of his\r\narmy, took post on the south, facing Schwarzenberg. On the morning of the\r\n16th, Schwarzenberg began the attack. His numbers did not exceed 150,000,\r\nfor the greater part of the Russian army was a march in the rear. The\r\nbattle was an even one. The Austrians failed to gain ground: with one more\r\narmy-corps Napoleon saw that he could overpower the enemy. He was still\r\nwithout intelligence of Blücher's actual appearance in the north; and in\r\nthe rash hope that Blücher's coming might be delayed, he sent orders to Ney\r\nand Marmont to leave their positions and hurry to the south to throw\r\nthemselves upon Schwarzenberg. Ney obeyed. Marmont, when the order reached\r\nhim, was actually receiving Blücher's first fire. He determined to remain\r\nand defend the village of Möckern, though left without support. York,\r\ncommanding the vanguard of Blücher's army, assailed him with the utmost\r\nfury. A third part of the troops engaged on each side were killed or\r\nwounded before the day closed; but in the end the victory of the Prussians\r\nwas complete. It was the only triumph won by the Allies on this first day\r\nof the battle, but it turned the scale against Napoleon. Marmont's corps\r\nwas destroyed; Ney, divided between Napoleon and Marmont, had rendered no\r\neffective help to either. Schwarzenberg, saved from a great disaster,\r\nneeded only to wait for Bernadotte and the Russian reserves, and to renew\r\nthe battle with an additional force of 100,000 men.\r\n\r\n[Storm of Leipzig, 19th. French retreat.]\r\n\r\n[Battle of the 18th.]\r\n\r\nIn the course of the night Napoleon sent proposals for peace. It was in the\r\nvain hope of receiving some friendly answer from his father-in-law, the\r\nAustrian Emperor, that he delayed making his retreat during the next day,\r\nwhile it might still have been unmolested. No answer was returned to his\r\nletter. In the evening of the 17th, Bennigsen's army reached the field of\r\nbattle. Next morning began that vast and decisive encounter known in the\r\nlanguage of Germany as \"the battle of the nations,\" the greatest battle in\r\nall authentic history, the culmination of all the military effort of the\r\nNapoleonic age. Not less than 300,000 men fought on the side of the Allies;\r\nNapoleon's own forces numbered 170,000. The battle raged all round Leipzig,\r\nexcept on the west, where no attempt was made to interpose between Napoleon\r\nand the line of his retreat. As in the first engagement, the decisive\r\nsuccesses were those of Blücher, now tardily aided by Bernadotte, on the\r\nnorth; Schwarzenberg's divisions, on the south side of the town, fought\r\nsteadily, but without gaining much ground. But there was no longer any\r\ndoubt as to the issue of the struggle. If Napoleon could not break the\r\nAllies in the first engagement, he had no chance against them now when they\r\nhad been joined by 100,000 more men. The storm of attack grew wilder and\r\nwilder: there were no new forces to call up for the defence. Before the day\r\nwas half over Napoleon drew in his outer line, and began to make\r\ndispositions for a retreat from Leipzig. At evening long trains of wounded\r\nfrom the hospitals passed through the western gates of the city along the\r\nroad towards the Rhine. In the darkness of night the whole army was\r\nwithdrawn from its positions, and dense masses poured into the town, until\r\nevery street was blocked with confused and impenetrable crowds of cavalry\r\nand infantry. The leading divisions moved out of the gates before sunrise.\r\nAs the throng lessened, some degree of order was restored, and the troops\r\nwhich Napoleon intended to cover the retreat took their places under the\r\nwalls of Leipzig. The Allies advanced to the storm on the morning of the\r\n19th. The French were driven into the town; the victorious enemy pressed on\r\ntowards the rear of the retreating columns. In the midst of the struggle an\r\nexplosion was heard above the roar of the battle. The bridge over the\r\nElster, the only outlet from Leipzig to the west, had been blown up by\r\n--the mistake of a French soldier before the rear-guard began to cross. The\r\nmass of fugitives, driven from the streets of the town, found before them\r\nan impassable river. Some swam to the opposite bank or perished in\r\nattempting to do so; the rest, to the number of 15,000, laid down their\r\narms. This was the end of the battle. Napoleon had lost in the three days\r\n40,000 killed and wounded, 260 guns, and 30,000 prisoners. The killed and\r\nwounded of the Allies reached the enormous sum of 54,000.\r\n\r\n[Conditions of peace offered to Napoleon at Frankfort, Nov. 9th.]\r\n\r\n[Allies follow Napoleon to the Rhine.]\r\n\r\nThe campaign was at an end. Napoleon led off a large army, but one that was\r\nin no condition to turn upon its pursuers. At each stage in the retreat\r\nthousands of fever-stricken wretches were left to terrify even the pursuing\r\narmy with the dread of their infection. It was only when the French found\r\nthe road to Frankfort blocked at Hanau by a Bavarian force that they\r\nrallied to the order of battle. The Bavarians were cut to pieces; the road\r\nwas opened; and, a fortnight after the Battle of Leipzig, Napoleon, with\r\nthe remnant of his great army, re-crossed the Rhine. Behind him the fabric\r\nof his Empire fell to the ground. Jerome fled from Westphalia; [186] the\r\nprinces of the Rhenish Confederacy came one after another to make their\r\npeace with the Allies; Bülow, with the army which had conquered Ney at\r\nDennewitz, marched through the north of Germany to the deliverance of\r\nHolland. Three days after Napoleon had crossed the Rhine the Czar reached\r\nFrankfort; and here, on the 7th of November, a military council was held,\r\nin which Blücher and Gneisenau, against almost all the other generals,\r\nadvocated an immediate invasion of France. The soldiers, however, had time\r\nto re-consider their opinions, for, on the 9th, it was decided by the\r\nrepresentatives of the Powers to send an offer of peace to Napoleon, and\r\nthe operations of the war were suspended by common consent. The condition\r\non which peace was offered to Napoleon was the surrender of the conquests\r\nof France beyond the Alps and the Rhine. The Allies were still willing to\r\npermit the Emperor to retain Belgium, Savoy, and the Rhenish Provinces;\r\nthey declined, however, to enter into any negotiation until Napoleon had\r\naccepted this basis of peace; and they demanded a distinct reply before the\r\nend of the month of November.\r\n\r\n[Offer of peace withdrawn, Dec. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Plan of invasion of France.]\r\n\r\n[Allies enter France, Jan., 1814.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon, who had now arrived in Paris, and saw around him all the signs of\r\npower, returned indefinite answers. The month ended without the reply which\r\nthe Allies required; and on the 1st of December the offer of peace was\r\ndeclared to be withdrawn. It was still undecided whether the war should\r\ntake the form of an actual invasion of France. The memory of Brunswick's\r\ncampaign of 1792, and of the disasters of the first coalition in 1793, even\r\nnow exercised a powerful influence over men's minds. Austria was unwilling\r\nto drive Napoleon to extremities, or to give to Russia and Prussia the\r\nincreased influence which they would gain in Europe from the total\r\noverthrow of Napoleon's power. It was ultimately determined that the allied\r\narmies should enter France, but that the Austrians, instead of crossing the\r\nnorth-eastern frontier, should make a détour by Switzerland, and gain the\r\nplateau of Langres in Champagne, from which the rivers Seine, Marne, and\r\nAube, with the roads following their valleys, descend in the direction of\r\nthe capital. The plateau of Langres was said to be of such strategical\r\nimportance that its occupation by an invader would immediately force\r\nNapoleon to make peace. As a matter of fact, the plateau was of no\r\nstrategical importance whatever; but the Austrians desired to occupy it,\r\npartly with the view of guarding against any attack from the direction of\r\nItaly and Lyons, partly from their want of the heavy artillery necessary\r\nfor besieging the fortresses farther north, [187] and from a just\r\nappreciation of the dangers of a campaign conducted in a hostile country\r\nintersected by several rivers. Anything was welcomed by Metternich that\r\nseemed likely to avert, or even to postpone, a struggle with Napoleon for\r\nlife or death. Blücher correctly judged the march through Switzerland to be\r\nmere procrastination. He was himself permitted to take the straight road\r\ninto France, though his movements were retarded in order to keep pace with\r\nthe cautious steps of Schwarzenberg. On the last day of the year 1813 the\r\nPrussian general crossed the Rhine near Coblentz; on the 18th of January,\r\n1814, the Austrian army, having advanced from Switzerland by Belfort and\r\nVesoul, reached its halting-place on the plateau of Langres. Here the march\r\nstopped; and here it was expected that terms of peace would be proposed by\r\nNapoleon.\r\n\r\n[Wellington entering France from the south.]\r\n\r\nIt was not on the eastern side alone that the invader was now entering\r\nFrance. Wellington had passed the Pyrenees. His last victorious march into\r\nthe north of Spain began on the day when the Prussian and Russian armies\r\nwere defeated by Napoleon at Bautzen (May 21, 1813). During the armistice\r\nof Dresden, a week before Austria signed the treaty which fixed the\r\nconditions of its armed mediation, he had gained an overwhelming triumph at\r\nVittoria over King Joseph and the French army, as it retreated with all the\r\nspoils gathered in five years' occupation of Spain (June 21). A series of\r\nbloody engagements had given the English the passes of the Pyrenees in\r\nthose same days of August and September that saw the allied armies close\r\naround Napoleon at Dresden; and when, after the catastrophe of Leipzig, the\r\nwreck of Napoleon's host was retreating beyond the Rhine, Soult, the\r\ndefender of the Pyrenees, was driven by the British general from his\r\nentrenchments on the Nivelle, and forced back under the walls of Bayonne.\r\n\r\n[French armies unable to hold the frontier.]\r\n\r\n[Napoleon's plan of defence.]\r\n\r\nTwenty years had passed since, in the tempestuous morn of the Revolution,\r\nHoche swept the armies of the first coalition across the Alsatian frontier.\r\nSince then, French soldiers had visited every capital, and watered every\r\nsoil with their blood; but no foreign soldier had set foot on French soil.\r\nNow the cruel goads of Napoleon's military glory had spent the nation's\r\nstrength, and the force no longer existed which could bar the way to its\r\ngathered enemies. The armies placed upon the eastern frontier had to fall\r\nback before an enemy five times more numerous than themselves. Napoleon had\r\nnot expected that the Allies would enter France before the spring. With\r\nthree months given him for organisation, he could have made the\r\nfrontier-armies strong enough to maintain their actual positions; the\r\nwinter advance of the Allies compelled him to abandon the border districts\r\nof France, and to concentrate his defence in Champagne, between the Marne,\r\nthe Seine, and the Aube. This district was one which offered extraordinary\r\nadvantages to a great general acting against an irresolute and\r\nill-commanded enemy. By holding the bridges over the three rivers, and\r\ndrawing his own supplies along the central road from Paris to\r\nArcis-sur-Aube, Napoleon could securely throw the bulk of his forces from\r\none side to the other against the flank of the Allies, while his own\r\nmovements were covered by the rivers, which could not be passed except at\r\nthe bridges. A capable commander at the head of the Allies would have\r\nemployed the same river-strategy against Napoleon himself, after conquering\r\none or two points of passage by main force; but Napoleon had nothing of the\r\nkind to fear from Schwarzenberg; and if the Austrian head-quarters\r\ncontinued to control the movements of the allied armies, it was even now\r\ndoubtful whether the campaign would close at Paris or on the Rhine.\r\n\r\n[Campaign of 1814.]\r\n\r\nFor some days after the arrival of the monarchs and diplomatists at Langres\r\n(Jan. 22), Metternich and the more timorous among the generals opposed any\r\nfurther advance into France, and argued that the army had already gained\r\nall it needed by the occupation of the border provinces. It was only upon\r\nthe threat of the Czar to continue the war by himself that the Austrians\r\nconsented to move forward upon Paris. After several days had been lost in\r\ndiscussion, the advance from Langres was begun. Orders were given to\r\nBlücher, who had pushed back the French divisions commanded by Marmont and\r\nMortier, and who was now near St. Dizier on the Marne, to meet the Great\r\nArmy at Brienne. This was the situation of the Allies when, on the 25th of\r\nJanuary, Napoleon left Paris, and placed himself at Châlons on the Marne,\r\nat the head of his left wing, having his right at Troyes and at Arcis,\r\nguarding the bridges over the Seine and the Aube. Napoleon knew that\r\nBlücher was moving towards the Austrians; he hoped to hold the Prussian\r\ngeneral in check at St. Dizier, and to throw himself upon the heads of\r\nSchwarzenberg's columns as they moved towards the Aube. Blücher, however,\r\nhad already passed St. Dizier when Napoleon reached it. Napoleon pursued,\r\nand overtook the Prussians at Brienne. After an indecisive battle, Blücher\r\nfell back towards Schwarzenberg. The allied armies effected their junction,\r\nand Blücher, now supported by the Austrians, turned and marched down the\r\nright bank of the Aube to meet Napoleon. Napoleon, though far outnumbered,\r\naccepted battle. He was attacked at La Rothière close above Brienne, and\r\ndefeated with heavy loss (Feb. 1). A vigorous pursuit would probably have\r\nended the war; but the Austrians held back. Schwarzenberg believed peace to\r\nbe already gained, and condemned all further action as useless waste of\r\nlife. In spite of the protests of the Emperor Alexander, he allowed\r\nNapoleon to retire unmolested. Schwarzenberg's inaction was no mere error\r\nin military judgment. There was a direct conflict between the Czar and the\r\nAustrian Cabinet as to the end to be obtained by the war. Alexander already\r\ninsisted on the dethronement of Napoleon; the Austrian Government would\r\nhave been content to leave Napoleon in power if he would accept a peace\r\ngiving France no worse a frontier than it had possessed in 1791.\r\nCastlereagh, who had come from England, and Hardenberg were as yet inclined\r\nto support Metternich's policy, although the whole Prussian army, the\r\npublic opinion of Great Britain, and the counsels of Stein and all the\r\nbolder Prussian statesmen, were on the side of the Czar. [188]\r\n\r\n[Congress of Châtillon, Feb. 5-9.]\r\n\r\nAlready the influence of the peace-party was so far in the ascendant that\r\nnegotiations had been opened with Napoleon. Representatives of all the\r\nPowers assembled at Châtillon, in Burgundy; and there, towards the end of\r\nJanuary, Caulaincourt appeared on behalf of France. The first sitting took\r\nplace on the 5th of February; on the following day Caulaincourt received\r\nfull powers from Napoleon to conclude peace. The Allies laid down as the\r\ncondition of peace the limitation of France to the frontiers of 1791. Had\r\nCaulaincourt dared to conclude peace instantly on these terms, Napoleon\r\nwould have retained his throne; but he was aware that Napoleon had only\r\ngranted him full powers in consequence of the disastrous battle of La\r\nRothière, and he feared to be disavowed by his master as soon as the army\r\nhad escaped from danger. Instead of simply accepting the Allies' offer, he\r\nraised questions as to the future of Italy and Germany. The moment was\r\nlost; on the 9th of February the Czar recalled his envoy from Châtillon,\r\nand the sittings of the Congress were broken off.\r\n\r\n[Defeats of Blücher on the Marne Feb. 10-14.]\r\n\r\n[Montereau, Feb 18.]\r\n\r\n[Austrians fall back towards Langres.]\r\n\r\nSchwarzenberg was now slowly and unwillingly moving forwards along the\r\nSeine towards Troyes. Blücher was permitted to return to the Marne, and to\r\nadvance upon Paris by an independent line of march. He crossed the country\r\nbetween the Aube and the Marne, and joined some divisions which he had left\r\nbehind him on the latter river. But his dispositions were outrageously\r\ncareless: his troops were scattered over a space of sixty miles from\r\nChâlons westward, as if he had no enemy to guard against except the weak\r\ndivisions commanded by Mortier and Marmont, which had uniformly fallen back\r\nbefore his advance. Suddenly Napoleon himself appeared at the centre of the\r\nlong Prussian line at Champaubert. He had hastened northwards in pursuit of\r\nBlücher with 30,000 men, as soon as Schwarzenberg entered Troyes; and on\r\nFebruary 10th a weak Russian corps that lay in the centre of Blücher's\r\ncolumn was overwhelmed before it was known the Emperor had left the Seine.\r\nThen, turning leftwards, Napoleon overthrew the Prussian vanguard at\r\nMontmirail, and two days later attacked and defeated Blücher himself, who\r\nwas bringing up the remainder of his troops in total ignorance of the enemy\r\nwith whom he had to deal. In four days Blücher's army, which numbered\r\n70,000 men, had thrice been defeated in detail by a force of 30,000.\r\nBlücher was compelled to fall back upon Châlons; Napoleon instantly\r\nreturned to the support of Oudinot's division, which he had left in front\r\nof Schwarzenberg. In order to relieve Blücher, the Austrians had pushed\r\nforward on the Seine beyond Montereau. Within three days after the battle\r\nwith Blücher, Napoleon was back upon the Seine, and attacking the heads of\r\nthe Austrian column. On the 18th of February he gained so decisive a\r\nvictory at Montereau that Schwarzenberg abandoned the advance, and fell\r\nback upon Troyes, sending word to Blücher to come southwards again and help\r\nhim to fight a great battle. Blücher moved off with admirable energy, and\r\ncame into the neighbourhood of Troyes within a week after his defeats upon\r\nthe Marne. But the design of fighting a great battle was given up. The\r\ndisinclination of the Austrians to vigorous action was too strong to be\r\novercome; and it was finally determined that Schwarzenberg should fall back\r\nalmost to the plateau of Langres, leaving Blücher to unite with the troops\r\nof Bülow which had conquered Holland, and to operate on the enemy's flank\r\nand rear.\r\n\r\n[Congress of Châtillon resumed, Feb. 17-March 15.]\r\n\r\nThe effect of Napoleon's sudden victories on the Marne was instantly seen\r\nin the councils of the allied sovereigns. Alexander, who had withdrawn his\r\nenvoy from Châtillon, could no longer hold out against negotiations with\r\nNapoleon. He restored the powers of his envoy, and the Congress\r\nre-assembled. But Napoleon already saw himself in imagination driving the\r\ninvaders beyond the Rhine, and sent orders to Caulaincourt to insist upon\r\nthe terms proposed at Frankfort, which left to France both the Rhenish\r\nProvinces and Belgium. At the same time he attempted to open a private\r\nnegotiation with his father-in-law the Emperor of Austria, and to detach\r\nhim from the cause of the Allies. The attempt failed; the demands now made\r\nby Caulaincourt overcame even the peaceful inclinations of the Austrian\r\nMinister; and on the 1st of March the Allies signed a new treaty at\r\nChaumont, pledging themselves to conclude no peace with Napoleon that did\r\nnot restore the frontier of 1791, and to maintain a defensive alliance\r\nagainst France for a period of twenty years. [189] Caulaincourt continued\r\nfor another fortnight at Châtillon, instructed by Napoleon to prolong the\r\nnegotiations, but forbidden to accept the only conditions which the Allies\r\nwere willing to grant.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon follows Blücher to the north. Battle of Laon, March 10.]\r\n\r\nBlücher was now on his way northwards to join the so-called army of\r\nBernadotte upon the Aisne. Since the Battle of Leipzig, Bernadotte himself\r\nhad taken no part in the movements of the army nominally under his command.\r\nThe Netherlands had been conquered by Bülow and the Russian general\r\nWinzingerode, and these officers were now pushing southwards in order to\r\ntake part with Blücher in a movement against Paris. Napoleon calculated\r\nthat the fortress of Soissons would bar the way to the northern army, and\r\nenable him to attack and crush Blücher before he could effect a junction\r\nwith his colleagues. He set out in pursuit of the Prussians, still hoping\r\nfor a second series of victories like those he had won upon the Marne. But\r\nthe cowardice of the commander of Soissons ruined his chances of success.\r\nThe fortress surrendered to the Russians at the first summons. Blücher met\r\nthe advanced guard of the northern army upon the Aisne on the 4th of March,\r\nand continued his march towards Laon for the purpose of uniting with its\r\ndivisions which lay in the rear. The French followed, but the only\r\nadvantage gained by Napoleon was a victory over a detached Russian corps at\r\nCraonne. Marmont was defeated with heavy loss by a sally of Blücher from\r\nhis strong position on the hill of Laon (March 10); and the Emperor\r\nhimself, unable to restore the fortune of the battle, fell back upon\r\nSoissons, and thence marched southward to throw himself again upon the line\r\nof the southern army.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon marches to the rear of the Allies, March 23.]\r\n\r\n[The Allies advance on Paris.]\r\n\r\nSchwarzenberg had once more begun to move forward on the news of Blücher's\r\nvictory at Laon. His troops were so widely dispersed that Napoleon might\r\neven now have cut the line in halves had he known Schwarzenberg's real\r\nposition. But he made a détour in order to meet Oudinot's corps, and gave\r\nthe Austrians time to concentrate at Arcis-sur-Aube. Here, on the 20th of\r\nMarch, Napoleon found himself in face of an army of 100,000 men. His own\r\narmy was less than a third of that number; yet with unalterable contempt\r\nfor the enemy he risked another battle. No decided issue was reached in the\r\nfirst day's fighting, and Napoleon remained in position, expecting that\r\nSchwarzenberg would retreat during the night. But on the morrow the\r\nAustrians were still fronting him. Schwarzenberg had at length learnt his\r\nown real superiority, and resolved to assist the enemy no longer by a\r\nwretched system of retreat. A single act of firmness on the part of the\r\nAustrian commander showed Napoleon that the war of battles was at an end.\r\nHe abandoned all hope of resisting the invaders in front: it only remained\r\nfor him to throw himself on to their rear, and, in company with the\r\nfrontier-garrisons and the army of Lyons, to attack their communications\r\nwith Germany. The plan was no unreasonable one, if Paris could either have\r\nsustained a siege or have fallen into the enemy's hands without terminating\r\nthe war. But the Allies rightly judged that Napoleon's power would be\r\nextinct from the moment that Paris submitted. They received the\r\nintelligence of the Emperor's march to the east, and declined to follow\r\nhim. The armies of Schwarzenberg and Blücher approached one another, and\r\nmoved together on Paris. It was at Vitry, on March 27th, that Napoleon\r\nfirst discovered that the troops which had appeared to be following his\r\neastward movement were but a detachment of cavalry, and that the allied\r\narmies were in full march upon the capital. He instantly called up every\r\ndivision within reach, and pushed forward by forced marches for the Seine,\r\nhoping to fall upon Schwarzenberg's rear before the allied vanguard could\r\nreach Paris. But at each hour of the march it became more evident that the\r\nenemy was far in advance. For two days Napoleon urged his men forward; at\r\nlength, unable to bear the intolerable suspense, he quitted the army on the\r\nmorning of the 30th, and drove forward at the utmost speed along the road\r\nthrough Fontainebleau to the capital. As day sank, he met reports of a\r\nbattle already begun. When he reached the village of Fromenteau, fifteen\r\nmiles from Paris, at ten o'clock at night, he heard that Paris had actually\r\nsurrendered.\r\n\r\n[Attack on Paris, March 30.]\r\n\r\n[Capitulation of Marmont.]\r\n\r\n[Allies enter Paris, March 31.]\r\n\r\nThe Allies had pressed forward without taking any notice of Napoleon's\r\nmovements, and at early morning on the 30th they had opened the attack on\r\nthe north-eastern heights of Paris. Marmont, with the fragments of a beaten\r\narmy and some weak divisions of the National Guard, had but 35,000 men to\r\noppose to three times that number of the enemy. The Government had taken no\r\nsteps to arm the people, or to prolong resistance after the outside line of\r\ndefence was lost, although the erection of barricades would have held the\r\nAllies in check until Napoleon arrived with his army. While Marmont fought\r\nin the outer suburbs, masses of the people were drawn up on Montmartre,\r\nexpecting the Emperor's appearance, and the spectacle of a great and\r\ndecisive battle. But the firing in the outskirts stopped soon after noon:\r\nit was announced that Marmont had capitulated. The report struck the people\r\nwith stupor and fury. They had vainly been demanding arms since early\r\nmorning; and even after the capitulation unsigned papers were handed about\r\nby men of the working classes, advocating further resistance. [190] But the\r\npeople no longer knew how to follow leaders of its own. Napoleon had\r\ntrained France to look only to himself: his absence left the masses, who\r\nwere still eager to fight for France, helpless in the presence of the\r\nconqueror: there were enemies enough of the Government among the richer\r\nclasses to make the entry of the foreigner into Paris a scene of actual joy\r\nand exultation. To such an extent had the spirit of caste and the malignant\r\ndelight in Napoleon's ruin overpowered the love of France among the party\r\nof the old noblesse, that upon the entry of the allied forces into Paris on\r\nthe 31st of March hundreds of aristocratic women kissed the hands, or the\r\nvery boots and horses, of the leaders of the train, and cheered the\r\nCossacks who escorted a band of French prisoners, bleeding and exhausted,\r\nthrough the streets.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon dethroned, April 2.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon's reign was indeed at an end. Since the rupture of the Congress of\r\nChâtillon on the 18th of March, the Allies had determined to make his\r\ndethronement a condition of peace. As the end approached, it was seen that\r\nno successor was possible but the chief of the House of Bourbon, although\r\nAustria would perhaps have consented to the establishment of a Regency\r\nunder the Empress Marie Louise, and the Czar had for a time entertained the\r\nproject of placing Bernadotte at the head of the French State. Immediately\r\nafter the entry into Paris it was determined to raise the exile Louis\r\nXVIII. to the throne. The politicians of the Empire who followed Talleyrand\r\nwere not unwilling to unite with the conquerors, and with the small party\r\nof Royalist noblesse, in recalling the Bourbon dynasty. Alexander, who was\r\nthe real master of the situation, rightly judged Talleyrand to be the man\r\nmost capable of enlisting the public opinion of France on the side of the\r\nnew order. He took up his abode at Talleyrand's house, and employed this\r\ndexterous statesman as the advocate both of the policy of the Allies, and\r\nof the principles of constitutional liberty, which at this time Alexander\r\nhimself sincerely befriended. A Provisional Government was appointed under\r\nTalleyrand's leadership. On the 2nd of April the Senate proclaimed the\r\ndethronement of Napoleon. On the 6th it published a Constitution, and\r\nrecalled the House of Bourbon.\r\n\r\nLouis XVIII. was still in England: his brother, the Count of Artois, had\r\njoined the invaders in France and assumed the title of Lieutenant of the\r\nKingdom; but the influence of Alexander was necessary to force this\r\nobstinate and unteachable man into anything like a constitutional position.\r\nThe Provisional Government invited the Count to take up the administration\r\nuntil the King's arrival, in virtue of a decree of the Senate. D'Artois\r\ndeclined to recognise the Senate's competency, and claimed the Lieutenancy\r\nof the Kingdom as his brother's representative. The Senate refusing to\r\nadmit the Count's divine right, some unmeaning words were exchanged when\r\nd'Artois entered Paris; and the Provisional Government, disregarding the\r\nclaims of the Royal Lieutenant, continued in the full exercise of its\r\npowers. At length the Czar insisted that d'Artois should give way. The\r\ndecree of the Senate was accordingly accepted by him at the Tuileries on\r\nthe 14th of April; the Provisional Government retired, and a Council of\r\nState was formed, in which Talleyrand still continued to exercise the real\r\npowers of government. In the address made by d'Artois on this occasion, he\r\nstated that although the King had not empowered him to accept the\r\nConstitution made by the Senate on the 6th of April, he entertained no\r\ndoubt that the King would accept the principles embodied in that\r\nConstitution, which were those of Representative Government, of the freedom\r\nof the press, and of the responsibility of ministers. A week after\r\nd'Artois' declaration, Louis XVIII. arrived in France.\r\n\r\n[Louis XVIII. and the Czar.]\r\n\r\n[Louis XVIII. enters Paris, May 3.]\r\n\r\nLouis XVIII., though capable of adapting himself in practice to a\r\nconstitutional system, had never permitted himself to question the divine\r\nright of the House of Bourbon to sovereign power. The exiles who surrounded\r\nhim were slow to understand the needs of the time. They recommended the\r\nKing to reject the Constitution. Louis made an ambiguous answer when the\r\nLegislative Body met him at Compiègne and invited an expression of the\r\nroyal policy. It was again necessary for the Czar to interfere, and to\r\nexplain to the King that France could no longer be an absolute monarchy.\r\nLouis, however, was a better arguer than the Count of Artois. He reasoned\r\nas a man whom the sovereigns of Europe had felt it their duty to restore\r\nwithout any request from himself. If the Senate of Napoleon, he urged, had\r\nthe right to give France a Constitution, he himself ought never to have\r\nbeen brought from his peaceful English home. He was willing to grant a free\r\nConstitution to his people in exercise of his own royal rights, but he\r\ncould not recognise one created by the servants of an usurper. Alexander\r\nwas but half satisfied with the liberal professions of Louis: he did not,\r\nhowever, insist on his acceptance of the Constitution drawn up by the\r\nSenate, but he informed him that until the promises made by d'Artois were\r\nconfirmed by a royal proclamation, there would be no entry into Paris. The\r\nKing at length signed a proclamation written by Talleyrand, and made his\r\nfestal entry into the capital on the 3rd of May.\r\n\r\n[Feeling of Paris.]\r\n\r\nThe promises of Louis himself, the unbroken courtesy and friendliness shown\r\nby the Allies to Paris since their victory a month before, had almost\r\nextinguished the popular feeling of hostility towards a dynasty which owed\r\nits recall to the overthrow of French armies. The foreign leaders\r\nthemselves had begun to excite a certain admiration and interest. Alexander\r\nwas considered, and with good reason, as a generous enemy; the simplicity\r\nof the King of Prussia, his misfortunes, his well-remembered gallantry at\r\nthe Battle of Jena, gained him general sympathy. It needed but little on\r\nthe part of the returning Bourbons to convert the interest and curiosity of\r\nParis into affection. The cortège which entered the capital with Louis\r\nXVIII. brought back, in a singular motley of obsolete and of foreign\r\ncostumes, the bearers of many unforgotten names. The look of the King\r\nhimself, as he drove through Paris, pleased the people. The childless\r\nfather of the murdered Duke of Enghien gained the pitying attention of\r\nthose few who knew the face of a man twenty-five years an exile. But there\r\nwas one among the members of the returning families whom every heart in\r\nParis went out to meet. The daughter of Louis XVI., who had shared the\r\ncaptivity of her parents and of her brother, the sole survivor of her\r\ndeeply-wronged house, now returned as Duchess of Angoulême. The uniquely\r\nmournful history of her girlhood, and her subsequent marriage with her\r\ncousin, the son of the Count of Artois, made her the natural object of a\r\nwarmer sympathy than could attach to either of the brothers of Louis XVI.\r\nBut adversity had imprinted its lines too deeply upon the features and the\r\ndisposition of this joyless woman for a moment's light to return. Her voice\r\nand her aspect repelled the affection which thousands were eager to offer\r\nto her. Before the close of the first days of the restored monarchy, it was\r\nfelt that the Bourbons had brought back no single person among them who was\r\ncapable of winning the French nation's love.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon sent to Elba.]\r\n\r\n[Napoleon.]\r\n\r\nThe recall of the ancient line had been allowed to appear to the world as\r\nthe work of France itself; Napoleon's fate could only be fixed by his\r\nconquerors. After the fall of Paris, Napoleon remained at Fontainebleau\r\nawaiting events. The soldiers and the younger officers of his army were\r\nstill ready to fight for him; the marshals, however, were utterly weary,\r\nand determined that France should no longer suffer for the sake of a single\r\nman. They informed Napoleon that he must abdicate. Yielding to their\r\npressure, Napoleon, on the 3rd of April, drew up an act of abdication in\r\nfavour of his infant son, and sent it by Caulaincourt to the allied\r\nsovereigns at Paris. The document was rejected by the Allies; Caulaincourt\r\nreturned with the intelligence that Napoleon must renounce the throne for\r\nhimself and all his family. For a moment the Emperor thought of renewing\r\nthe war; but the marshals refused their aid more resolutely than before,\r\nand, on the 6th of April, Napoleon signed an unconditional surrender of the\r\nthrone for himself and his heirs. He was permitted by the Allies to retain\r\nthe unmeaning title of Emperor, and to carry with him a body-guard and a\r\nconsiderable revenue to the island of Elba, henceforward to be his\r\nprincipality and his prison. The choice of this island, within easy reach\r\nof France and Italy, and too extensive to be guarded without a large fleet,\r\nwas due to Alexander's ill-judged generosity towards Napoleon, and to a\r\npromise made to Marmont that the liberty of the Emperor should be\r\nrespected. Alexander was not left without warning of the probable effects\r\nof his leniency. Sir Charles Stewart, military representative of Great\r\nBritain at the allied head-quarters, urged both his own and the allied\r\nGovernments to substitute some more distant island for Elba, if they\r\ndesired to save Europe from a renewed Napoleonic war, and France from the\r\nmisery of a second invasion. The Allies, though not without misgivings,\r\nadhered to their original plan, and left it to time to justify the\r\npredictions of their adviser.\r\n\r\n[Treaty of Paris, May 30.]\r\n\r\nIt was well known what would be the terms of peace, now that Napoleon was\r\nremoved from the throne. The Allies had no intention of depriving France of\r\nany of the territory that it had held before 1792: the conclusion of a\r\ndefinitive Treaty was only postponed until the Constitution, which\r\nAlexander required King Louis XVIII. to grant, had been drawn up by a royal\r\ncommission and approved by the King. On the 27th of May the draft of this\r\nConstitution, known as the Charta, was laid before the King, and sanctioned\r\nby him; on the 30th, the Treaty of Paris was signed by the representatives\r\nof France and of all the great Powers. [191] France, surrendering all its\r\nconquests, accepted the frontier of the 1st of January, 1792, with a slight\r\naddition of territory on the side of Savoy and at points on its northern\r\nand eastern border. It paid no indemnity. It was permitted to retain all\r\nthe works of art accumulated by twenty years of rapine, except the trophies\r\ncarried from the Brandenburg Gate of Berlin and the spoils of the Library\r\nof Vienna. It received back nearly all the colonies which had been taken\r\nfrom it by Great Britain. By the clauses of the Treaty disposing of the\r\nterritory that had formed the Empire and the dependencies of Napoleon,\r\nHolland was restored to the House of Orange, with the provision that its\r\nterritory should be largely increased; Switzerland was declared\r\nindependent; it was stipulated that Italy, with the exception of the\r\nAustrian Provinces, should consist of independent States, and that Germany\r\nshould remain distributed among a multitude of sovereigns, independent, but\r\nunited by a Federal tie. The navigation of the Rhine was thrown open. By a\r\nspecial agreement with Great Britain the French Government undertook to\r\nunite its efforts to those of England in procuring the suppression of the\r\nSlave-trade by all the Powers, and pledged itself to abolish the\r\nSlave-trade among French subjects within five years at the latest. For the\r\nsettlement of all European questions not included in the Treaty of Paris it\r\nwas agreed that a Congress of the Powers should, within two months,\r\nassemble at Vienna. These were the public articles of the Treaty of Paris.\r\nSecret clauses provided that the Allies--that is, the Allies independently\r\nof France--should control the distributions of territory to be made at the\r\nCongress; that Austria should receive Venetia and all Northern Italy as far\r\nas the Ticino; that Genoa should be given to the King of Sardinia; and that\r\nthe Southern Netherlands should be united into a single kingdom with\r\nHolland, and thus form a solid bulwark against France on the north. No\r\nmention was made of Naples, whose sovereign, Murat, had abandoned Napoleon\r\nand allied himself with Austria, but without fulfilling in good faith the\r\nengagements into which he had entered against his former master. A nominal\r\nfriend of the Allies, he knew that he had played a double game, and that\r\nhis sovereignty, though not yet threatened, was insecure. [192]\r\n\r\n[Territorial arrangements of 1814.]\r\n\r\nMuch yet remained to be settled by the Congress at Vienna, but in the\r\nTreaty of Paris two at least of the great Powers saw the objects attained\r\nfor which they had straggled so persistently through all the earlier years\r\nof the war, and which at a later time had appeared to pass almost out of\r\nthe range of possibility. England saw the Netherlands once more converted\r\ninto a barrier against France, and Antwerp held by friendly hands. Austria\r\nreaped the full reward of its cool and well-balanced diplomacy during the\r\ncrisis of 1813, in the annexation of an Italian territory that made it the\r\nreal mistress of the Peninsula. Castlereagh and every other English\r\npolitician felt that Europe had done itself small honour in handing Venice\r\nback to the Hapsburg; but this had been the condition exacted by Metternich\r\nat Prague before he consented to throw the sword of Austria into the\r\ntrembling scale; [193] and the Republican traditions both of Venice and of\r\nGenoa counted for little among the statesmen of 1814, in comparison with\r\nthe divine right of a Duke of Modena or a Prince of Hesse Cassel. [194]\r\nFrance itself, though stripped of the dominion won by twenty years of\r\nwarfare, was permitted to retain, for the benefit of a restored line of\r\nkings, the whole of its ancient territory, and the spoil of all the\r\ngalleries and museums of Western Europe. It would have been no unnatural\r\nwrong if the conquerors of 1814 had dealt with the soil of France as France\r\nhad dealt with other lands; it would have been an act of bare justice to\r\nrestore to its rightful owners the pillage that had been brought to Paris,\r\nand to recover from the French treasury a part of the enormous sums which\r\nNapoleon had extorted from conquered States. But the Courts were too well\r\nsatisfied with their victory to enter into a strict account upon secondary\r\nmatters; and a prudent regard on the part of the Allies to the prospects of\r\nthe House of Bourbon saved France from experiencing what it had inflicted\r\nupon others.\r\n\r\n[All the Powers except France gained territory by the war, 1792-1814.]\r\n\r\nThe policy which now restored to France the frontier of 1792 was viewed\r\nwith a very different feeling in France and in all other countries. Europe\r\nlooked with a kind of wonder upon its own generosity; France forgot the\r\nunparalleled provocations which it had offered to mankind, and only\r\nremembered that Belgium and the Rhenish Provinces had formed part of the\r\nRepublic and the Empire for nearly twenty years. These early conquests of\r\nthe Republic, which no one had attempted to wrest from France since 1795,\r\nhad undoubtedly been the equivalent for which, in the days of the\r\nDirectory, Austria had been permitted to extend itself in Italy, and\r\nPrussia in Germany. In the opinion of men who sincerely condemned\r\nNapoleon's distant conquests, the territory between France and the Rhine\r\nwas no more than France might legitimately demand, as a counterpoise to the\r\nvast accessions falling to one or other of the Continental Powers out of\r\nthe territory of Poland, Venice, and the body of suppressed States in\r\nGermany. Poland, excluding the districts taken from it before 1792,\r\ncontained a population twice as great as that of Belgium and the Rhenish\r\nProvinces together: Venice carried with it, in addition to a commanding\r\nprovince on the Italian mainland, the Eastern Adriatic Coast as far as\r\nRagusa. If it were true that the proportionate increase of power formed the\r\nonly solid principle of European policy, France sustained a grievous injury\r\nin receiving back the limits of 1791, when every other State on the\r\nContinent was permitted to retain the territory, or an equivalent for the\r\nterritory, which it had gained in the great changes that took place between\r\n1791 and 1814. But in fact there had never been a time during the last\r\nhundred and fifty years when France, under an energetic Government, had not\r\npossessed a force threatening to all its neighbours. France, reduced to its\r\nancient limits, was still the equal, and far more than the equal, of any of\r\nthe Continental Powers, with all that they had gained during the\r\nRevolutionary War. It remained the first of European nations, though no\r\nlonger, as in the eighteenth century, the one great nation of the western\r\ncontinent. Its efforts after universal empire had aroused other nations\r\ninto life. Had the course of French conquest ceased before Napoleon grasped\r\npower, France would have retained its frontier of the Rhine, and long have\r\nexercised an unbounded influence over both Germany and Italy, through the\r\nincomparably juster and brighter social life which the Revolution, combined\r\nwith all that France had inherited from the past, enabled it to display to\r\nthose countries. Napoleon, in the attempt to impose his rule upon all\r\nEurope, created a power in Germany whose military future was to be not less\r\nsolid than that of France itself, and left to Europe, in the accord of his\r\nenemies, a firmer security against French attack than any that the efforts\r\nof statesmen had ever framed.\r\n\r\n[Permanent effect on Europe of period 1792-1814.]\r\n\r\n[National sense excited in Germany and Italy.]\r\n\r\nThe league of the older monarchies had proved stronger in the end than the\r\ngenius and the ambition of a single man. But if, in the service of\r\nNapoleon, France had exhausted its wealth, sunk its fleets, and sacrificed\r\na million lives, only that it might lose all its earlier conquests, and\r\nresume limits which it had outgrown before Napoleon held his first command,\r\nit was not thus with the work which, for or against itself, France had\r\neffected in Europe during the movements of the last twenty years. In the\r\ncourse of the epoch now ending the whole of the Continent up to the\r\nfrontiers of Austria and Russia had gained the two fruitful ideas of\r\nnationality and political freedom. There were now two nations in Europe\r\nwhere before there had been but aggregates of artificial States. Germany\r\nand Italy were no longer mere geographical expressions: in both countries,\r\nthough in a very unequal degree, the newly-aroused sense of nationality had\r\nbrought with it the claim for unity and independence. In Germany, Prussia\r\nhad set a great example, and was hereafter to reap its reward; in Italy\r\nthere had been no State and no statesman to take the lead either in\r\nthrowing off Napoleon's rule, or in forcing him, as the price of support,\r\nto give to his Italian kingdom a really national government. Failing to act\r\nfor itself, the population of all Italy, except Naples, was parcelled out\r\nbetween Austria and the ancient dynasties; but the old days of passive\r\nsubmission to the foreigner were gone for ever, and time was to show\r\nwhether those were the dreamers who thought of a united Italy, or those who\r\nthought that Metternich's statesmanship had for ever settled the fate of\r\nVenice and of Milan.\r\n\r\n[Desire for political liberty.]\r\n\r\nThe second legacy of the Revolutionary epoch, the idea of constitutional\r\nfreedom, which in 1789 had been as much wanting in Spain, where national\r\nspirit was the strongest, as in those German States where it was the\r\nweakest, had been excited in Italy by the events of 1796 and 1798, in Spain\r\nby the disappearance of the Bourbon king and the self-directed struggle of\r\nthe nation against the invader; in Prussia it had been introduced by the\r\nGovernment itself when Stein was at the head of the State. \"It is\r\nimpossible,\" wrote Lord Castlereagh in the spring of 1814, \"not to perceive\r\na great moral change coming on in Europe, and that the principles of\r\nfreedom are in full operation.\" [195] There was in fact scarcely a Court in\r\nEurope which was not now declaring its intention to frame a Constitution.\r\nThe professions might be lightly made; the desire and the capacity for\r\nself-government might still be limited to a narrower class than the friends\r\nof liberty imagined; but the seed was sown, and a movement had begun which\r\nwas to gather strength during the next thirty years of European history,\r\nwhile one revolution after another proved that Governments could no longer\r\nwith safety disregard the rights of their subjects.\r\n\r\n[Social changes.]\r\n\r\nLastly, in all the territory that had formed Napoleon's Empire and\r\ndependencies, and also in Prussia, legal changes had been made in the\r\nrights and relations of the different classes of society, so important as\r\nalmost to create a new type of social life. Within the Empire itself the\r\nCode Napoléon, conferring upon the subjects of France the benefits which\r\nthe French had already won for themselves, had superseded a society resting\r\non class-privilege, on feudal service, and on the despotism of custom, by a\r\nsociety resting on equality before the law, on freedom of contract, and on\r\nthe unshackled ownership and enjoyment of land, whether the holder\r\npossessed an acre or a league. The principles of the French Code, if not\r\nthe Code itself, had been introduced into Napoleon's kingdom of Italy, into\r\nNaples, and into almost all the German dependencies of France. In Prussia\r\nthe reforms of Stein and Hardenberg had been directed, though less boldly,\r\ntowards the same end; and when, after 1814, the Rhenish Provinces were\r\nannexed to Prussia by the Congress of Vienna, the Government was wise\r\nenough and liberal enough to leave these districts in the enjoyment of the\r\nlaws which France had given them, and not to risk a comparison between even\r\nthe best Prussian legislation and the Code Napoleon. In other territory now\r\nsevered from France and restored to German or Italian princes, attempts\r\nwere not wanting to obliterate the new order and to re-introduce the\r\nburdens and confusions of the old regime. But these reactions, even where\r\nunopposed for a time, were too much in conflict with the spirit of the age\r\nto gain more than a temporary and precarious success. The people had begun\r\nto know good and evil: examples of a free social order were too close at\r\nhand to render it possible for any part of the western continent to relapse\r\nfor any very long period into the condition of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Limits.]\r\n\r\nIt was indeed within a distinct limit that the Revolutionary epoch effected\r\nits work of political and social change. Neither England nor Austria\r\nreceived the slightest impulse to progress. England, on the contrary,\r\nsuspended almost all internal improvement during the course of the war; the\r\ndomestic policy of the Austrian Court, so energetic in the reign\r\nimmediately preceding the Revolution, became for the next twenty years,\r\nexcept where it was a policy of repression, a policy of pure vacancy and\r\ninaction. But in all other States of Western Europe the period which\r\nreached its close with Napoleon's fall left deep and lasting traces behind\r\nit. Like other great epochs of change, it bore its own peculiar character.\r\nIt was not, like the Renaissance and the Reformation, a time when new\r\nworlds of faith and knowledge transformed the whole scope and conception of\r\nhuman life; it was not, like our own age, a time when scientific discovery\r\nand increased means of communication silently altered the physical\r\nconditions of existence; it was a time of changes directly political in\r\ntheir nature, and directly effected by the political agencies of\r\nlegislation and of war. In the perspective of history the Napoleonic age\r\nwill take its true place among other, and perhaps greater, epochs. Its\r\nelements of mere violence and disturbance will fill less space in the eyes\r\nof mankind; its permanent creations, more. As an epoch of purely political\r\nenergy, concentrating the work of generations within the compass of twenty\r\nfive years, it will perhaps scarcely find a parallel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Restoration of 1814--Norway--Naples--Westphalia--Spain--The Spanish\r\nConstitution overthrown: Victory of the Clergy--Restoration in France--The\r\nCharta--Encroachments of the Nobles and Clergy--Growing Hostility to the\r\nBourbons--Congress of Vienna--Talleyrand and the Four Powers--The Polish\r\nQuestion--The Saxon Question--Theory of Legitimacy--Secret Alliance against\r\nRussia and Prussia--Compromise--The Rhenish Provinces--Napoleon leaves Elba\r\nand lands in France--His Declarations--Napoleon at Grenoble, at Lyon, at\r\nParis--The Congress of Vienna unites Europe against France--Murat's Action\r\nin Italy--The Acte Additionnel--The Champ de Mai--Napoleon takes up the\r\noffensive--Battles of Ligny, Quatre Bras, Waterloo--Affairs at\r\nParis--Napoleon sent to St. Helena--Wellington and Fouché--Arguments on the\r\nproposed Cession of French Territory--Treaty of Holy Alliance--Second\r\nTreaty of Paris--Conclusion of the Work of the Congress of Vienna--\r\nFederation of Germany--Estimate of the Congress of Vienna and of the\r\nTreaties of 1815--The Slave Trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the events which, in the more recent history of mankind, have struck\r\nthe minds of nations with awe, and appeared to reveal in its direct\r\noperation a power overruling the highest human effort, there is none equal\r\nin grandeur and terror to the annihilation of Napoleon's army in the\r\ninvasion of Russia. It was natural that a generation which had seen State\r\nafter State overthrown, and each new violation of right followed by an\r\napparent consolidation of the conqueror's strength, should view in the\r\ncatastrophe of 1812 the hand of Providence visibly outstretched for the\r\ndeliverance of Europe. [196] Since that time many years have passed. Perils\r\nwhich then seemed to envelop the future of mankind now appear in part\r\nillusory; sacrifices then counted cheap have proved of heavy cost. The\r\nhistory of the two last generations shows that not everything was lost to\r\nEurope in passing subjection to a usurper, nor everything gained by the\r\nvictory of his opponents. It is now not easy to suppress the doubt whether\r\nthe permanent interests of mankind would not have been best served by\r\nNapoleon's success in 1812. His empire had already attained dimensions that\r\nrendered its ultimate disruption certain: less depended upon the\r\npostponement or the acceleration of its downfall than on the order of\r\nthings ready to take its place. The victory of Napoleon in 1812 would have\r\nbeen followed by the establishment of a Polish kingdom in the provinces\r\ntaken from Russia. From no generosity in the conqueror, from no sympathy on\r\nhis part with a fallen people, but from the necessities of his political\r\nsituation, Poland must have been so organised as to render it the bulwark\r\nof French supremacy in the East. The serf would have been emancipated. The\r\njust hatred of the peasant to the noble, which made the partition of 1772\r\neasy, and has proved fatal to every Polish uprising from that time to the\r\npresent, would have been appeased by an agrarian reform executed with\r\nNapoleon's own unrivalled energy and intelligence, and ushered in with\r\nbrighter hopes than have at any time in the history of Poland lit the dark\r\nshades of peasant-life. The motives which in 1807 had led Napoleon to stay\r\nhis hand, and to content himself with half-measures of emancipation in the\r\nDuchy of Warsaw [197], could have had no place after 1812, when Russia\r\nremained by his side, a mutilated but inexorable enemy, ever on the watch\r\nto turn to its own advantage the first murmurs of popular discontent beyond\r\nthe border. Political independence, the heritage of the Polish noble, might\r\nhave been withheld, but the blessing of landed independence would have been\r\nbestowed on the mass of the Polish people. In the course of some years this\r\nrestored kingdom, though governed by a member of the house of Bonaparte,\r\nwould probably have gained sufficient internal strength to survive the\r\ndownfall of Napoleon's Empire or his own decease. England, Austria, and\r\nTurkey would have found it no impossible task to prevent its absorption by\r\nAlexander at the re-settlement of Europe, if indeed the collapse of Russia\r\nhad not been followed by the overthrow of the Porte, and the establishment\r\nof a Greek, a Bulgarian, and a Roumanian Kingdom under the supremacy of\r\nFrance. By the side of the three absolute monarchs of Central and Eastern\r\nEurope there would have remained, upon Napoleon's downfall, at least one\r\npeople in possession of the tradition of liberty: and from the example of\r\nPoland, raised from the deep but not incurable degradation of its social\r\nlife, the rulers of Russia might have gained courage to emancipate the\r\nserf, without waiting for the lapse of another half-century and the\r\noccurrence of a second ruinous war. To compare a possible sequence of\r\nevents with the real course of history, to estimate the good lost and evil\r\ngot through events which at the time seemed to vindicate the moral\r\ngovernance of the world, is no idle exercise of the imagination. It may\r\nserve to give caution to the judgment: it may guard us against an arbitrary\r\nand fanciful interpretation of the actual. The generation which witnessed\r\nthe fall of Napoleon is not the only one which has seen Providence in the\r\nfulfilment of its own desire, and in the storm-cloud of nature and history\r\nhas traced with too sanguine gaze the sacred lineaments of human equity and\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n[Settlement of 1814.]\r\n\r\n[Norway.]\r\n\r\n[Naples.]\r\n\r\nThe Empire of Napoleon had indeed passed away. The conquests won by the\r\nfirst soldiers of the Republic were lost to France along with all the\r\nlatest spoils of its Emperor; but the restoration which was effected in\r\n1814 was no restoration of the political order which had existed on the\r\nContinent before the outbreak of the Revolutionary War. The Powers which\r\nhad overthrown Napoleon had been partakers, each in its own season, in the\r\nsystem of aggrandisement which had obliterated the old frontiers of Europe.\r\nRussia had gained Finland, Bessarabia, and the greater part of Poland;\r\nAustria had won Venice, Dalmatia, and Salzburg; Prussia had received\r\nbetween the years 1792 and 1806 an extension of territory in Poland and\r\nNorthern Germany that more than doubled its area. It was now no part of the\r\npolicy of the victorious Courts to reinstate the governments which they had\r\nthemselves dispossessed: the settlement of 1814, in so far as it deserved\r\nthe name of a restoration, was confined to the territory taken from\r\nNapoleon and from princes of his house. Here, though the claims of\r\nRepublics and Ecclesiastical Princes were forgotten, the titles of the old\r\ndynasties were freely recognised. In France itself, in the Spanish\r\nPeninsula, in Holland, Westphalia, Piedmont, and Tuscany, the banished\r\nhouses resumed their sovereignty. It cost the Allies nothing to restore\r\nthese countries to their hereditary rulers, and it enabled them to describe\r\nthe work of 1814 in general terms as the restoration of lawful government\r\nand national independence. But the claims of legitimacy, as well as of\r\nnational right, were, as a matter of fact, only remembered where there\r\nexisted no motive to disregard them; where they conflicted with\r\narrangements of policy, they received small consideration. Norway, which\r\nformed part of the Danish monarchy, had been promised by Alexander to\r\nBernadotte, Crown Prince of Sweden, in 1812, in return for his support\r\nagainst Napoleon, and the bargain had been ratified by the Allies. As soon\r\nas Napoleon was overthrown, Bernadotte claimed his reward. It was in vain\r\nthat the Norwegians, abandoned by their king, declared themselves\r\nindependent, and protested against being handed over like a flock of sheep\r\nby the liberators of Europe. The Allies held to their contract; a British\r\nfleet was sent to assist Bernadotte in overpowering his new subjects, and\r\nafter a brief resistance the Norwegians found themselves compelled to\r\nsubmit to their fate (April--Aug., 1814). [198] At the other extremity of\r\nEurope a second of Napoleon's generals still held his throne among the\r\nrestored legitimate monarchs. Murat, King of Naples, had forsaken Napoleon\r\nin time to make peace and alliance with Austria. Great Britain, though\r\nentering into a military convention, had not been a party to this treaty;\r\nand it had declared that its own subsequent support of Murat would depend\r\nupon the condition that he should honourably exert himself in Italy against\r\nNapoleon's forces. This condition Murat had not fulfilled. The British\r\nGovernment was, however, but gradually supplied with proofs of his\r\ntreachery; nor was Lord Liverpool, the Prime Minister, inclined to raise\r\nnew difficulties at Vienna by pressing the claim of Ferdinand of Sicily to\r\nhis territories on the mainland. [199] Talleyrand, on behalf of the\r\nrestored Bourbons of Paris, intended to throw all his strength into a\r\ndiplomatic attack upon Murat before the end of the Congress; but for the\r\npresent Murat's chances seemed to be superior to those of his rival.\r\nSouthern Italy thus continued in the hands of a soldier of fortune, who,\r\nunlike Bernadotte, was secretly the friend of Napoleon, and ready to\r\nsupport him in any attempt to regain his throne.\r\n\r\n[Restoration in Westphalia.]\r\n\r\nThe engagement of the Allies towards Bernadotte, added to the stipulations\r\nof the Peace of Paris, left little to be decided by the Congress of Vienna\r\nbeyond the fate of Poland, Saxony, and Naples, and the form of political\r\nunion to be established in Germany. It had been agreed that the Congress\r\nshould assemble within two months after the signature of the Peace of\r\nParis: this interval, however, proved to be insufficient, and the autumn\r\nhad set in before the first diplomatists arrived at Vienna, and began the\r\nconferences which preceded the formal opening of the Congress. In the\r\nmeantime a singular spectacle was offered to Europe by the Courts whose\r\nrestoration was the subject of so much official thanksgiving. Before King\r\nLouis XVIII. returned to Paris, the exiled dynasties had regained their\r\nthrones in Northern Germany and in Spain. The process of reaction had begun\r\nin Hanover and in Hesse as soon as the battle of Leipzig had dissolved the\r\nKingdom of Westphalia and driven Napoleon across the Rhine. Hanover indeed\r\ndid not enjoy the bodily presence of its Sovereign: its character was\r\noligarchical, and the reaction here was more the affair of the privileged\r\nclasses than of the Government. In Hesse a prince returned who was the very\r\nembodiment of divine right, a prince who had sturdily fought against French\r\ndemagogues in 1792, and over whose stubborn, despotic nature the\r\nrevolutions of a whole generation and the loss of his own dominions since\r\nthe battle of Jena had passed without leaving a trace. The Elector was\r\nseventy years old when, at the end of the year 1813, his faithful subjects\r\ndragged his carriage in triumph into the streets of Cassel. On the day\r\nafter his arrival he gave orders that the Hessian soldiery who had been\r\nsent on furlough after the battle of Jena should present themselves, every\r\nman in the garrison-town where he had stood on the 1st of November, 1806. A\r\nfew weeks later all the reforms of the last seven years were swept away\r\ntogether. The Code Napoleon ceased to be the law of the land; the old\r\noppressive distinctions of caste, with the special courts for the\r\nprivileged orders, came again into force, in defiance of the spirit of the\r\nage. The feudal burdens of the peasantry were revived, the purchasers of\r\nState-lands compelled to relinquish the land without receiving back any of\r\ntheir purchase-money. The decimal coinage was driven out of the country.\r\nThe old system of taxation, with its iniquitous exemptions, was renewed.\r\nAll promotions, all grants of rank made by Jerome's Government were\r\nannulled: every officer, every public servant resumed the station which he\r\nhad occupied on the 1st of November, 1806. The very pigtails and powder of\r\nthe common soldier under the old regime were revived. [200]\r\n\r\n[Restoration in Spain.]\r\n\r\nThe Hessians and their neighbours in North-Western Germany had from of old\r\nbeen treated with very little ceremony by their rulers; and if they\r\nwelcomed back a family which had been accustomed to hire them out at so\r\nmuch a head to fight against the Hindoos or by the side of the North\r\nAmerican Indians, it only proved that they preferred their native\r\ntaskmasters to Jerome Bonaparte and his French crew of revellers and\r\nusurers. The next scene in the European reaction was a far more mournful\r\none. Ferdinand of Spain had no sooner re-crossed the Pyrenees in the spring\r\nof 1814, than, convinced of his power by the transports of popular\r\nenthusiasm that attended his progress through Northern Spain, he determined\r\nto overthrow the Constitution of 1812, and to re-establish the absolute\r\nmonarchy which had existed before the war. The courtiers and ecclesiastics\r\nwho gathered round the King dispelled any scruples that he might have felt\r\nin lifting his hand against a settlement accepted by the nation. They\r\nrepresented to him that the Cortes of 1812--which, whatever their faults,\r\nhad been recognised as the legitimate Government of Spain by both England\r\nand Russia--consisted of a handful of desperate men, collected from the\r\nstreets of Cadiz, who had taken upon themselves to insult the Crown, to rob\r\nthe Church, and to imperil the existence of the Catholic Faith. On the\r\nentry of the King into Valencia, the cathedral clergy expressed the wishes\r\nof their order in the address of homage which they offered to Ferdinand.\r\n\"We beg your Majesty,\" their spokesman concluded, \"to take the most\r\nvigorous measures for the restoration of the Inquisition, and of the\r\necclesiastical system that existed in Spain before your Majesty's\r\ndeparture.\" \"These,\" replied the King, \"are my own wishes, and I will not\r\nrest until they are fulfilled.\" [201]\r\n\r\n[Spanish Constitution overthrown.]\r\n\r\nThe victory of the clergy was soon declared. On the 11th of May the King\r\nissued a manifesto at Valencia, proclaiming the Constitution of 1812 and\r\nevery decree of the Cortes null and void, and denouncing the penalties of\r\nhigh treason against everyone who should defend the Constitution by act,\r\nword, or writing. A variety of promises, made only to be broken,\r\naccompanied this assertion of the rights of the Crown. The King pledged\r\nhimself to summon new Cortes as soon as public order should be restored, to\r\nsubmit the expenditure to the control of the nation, and to maintain\r\ninviolate the security of person and property. It was a significant comment\r\nupon Ferdinand's professions of Liberalism that on the very day on which\r\nthe proclamation was issued the censorship of the Press was restored. But\r\nthe King had not miscalculated his power over the Spanish people. The same\r\nstorm of wild, unreasoning loyalty which had followed Ferdinand's\r\nreappearance in Spain followed the overthrow of the Constitution. The mass\r\nof the Spaniards were ignorant of the very meaning of political liberty:\r\nthey adored the King as a savage adores his fetish: their passions were at\r\nthe call of a priesthood as brutish and unscrupulous as that which in 1798\r\nhad excited the Lazzaroni of Naples against the Republicans of Southern\r\nItaly. No sooner had Ferdinand set the example, by arresting thirty of the\r\nmost distinguished of the Liberals, than tumults broke out in every part of\r\nthe country against Constitutionalist magistrates and citizens. Mobs,\r\nheaded by priests bearing the standard of the Inquisition, destroyed the\r\ntablets erected in honour of the Constitution of 1812, and burned Liberal\r\nwritings in bonfires in the market-places. The prisons were filled with men\r\nwho, but a short time before, had been the objects of popular adulation.\r\n\r\n[The clergy in power.]\r\n\r\nWhatever pledges of allegiance had been given to the Constitution of 1812,\r\nit was clear that this Constitution had no real hold on the nation, and\r\nthat Ferdinand fulfilled the wish of the majority of Spaniards in\r\noverthrowing it. A wise and energetic sovereign would perhaps have allowed\r\nhimself to use this outburst of religious fanaticism for the purpose of\r\nsubstituting some better order for the imprudent arrangements of 1812.\r\nFerdinand, an ignorant, hypocritical buffoon, with no more notion of\r\npolitical justice or generosity than the beasts of the field, could only\r\nsubstitute for the fallen Cortes a government by palace-favourites and\r\nconfessors. It was in vain, that the representatives of Great Britain urged\r\nthe King to fulfil his constitutional promises, and to liberate the persons\r\nwho had unjustly been thrown into prison. [202] The clergy were masters of\r\nSpain and of the King: their influence daily outweighed even that of\r\nFerdinand's own Ministers, when, under the pressure of financial necessity,\r\nthe Ministers began to offer some resistance to the exorbitant demands of\r\nthe priesthood. On the 23rd of May the King signed an edict restoring all\r\nmonasteries throughout Spain, and reinstating them in their lands. On the\r\n24th of June the clergy were declared exempt from taxation. On the 21st of\r\nJuly the Church won its crowning triumph in the re-establishment of the\r\nInquisition. In the meantime the army was left without pay, in some places\r\nactually without food. The country was at the mercy of bands of guerillas,\r\nwho, since the disappearance of the enemy, had turned into common brigands,\r\nand preyed upon their own countrymen. Commerce was extinct; agriculture\r\nabandoned; innumerable villages were lying in ruins; the population was\r\nbarbarised by the savage warfare with which for years past it had avenged\r\nits own sufferings upon the invader. Of all the countries of Europe, Spain\r\nwas the one in which the events of the Revolutionary epoch seemed to have\r\nleft an effect most nearly approaching to unmixed evil.\r\n\r\n[Restoration in France.]\r\n\r\nIn comparison with the reaction in the Spanish Peninsula the reaction in\r\nFrance was sober and dignified. Louis XVIII. was at least a scholar and a\r\nman of the world. In the old days, among companions whose names were now\r\nalmost forgotten, he had revelled in Voltaire and dallied with the\r\nfashionable Liberalism of the time. In his exile he had played the king\r\nwith some dignity; he was even believed to have learnt some political\r\nwisdom by his six years' residence in England. If he had not character,\r\n[203] he had at least some tact and some sense of humour; and if not a\r\nprofound philosopher, he was at least an accomplished epicurean. He hated\r\nthe zealotry of his brother, the Count of Artois. He was more inclined to\r\nquiz the emigrants than to sacrifice anything on their behalf; and the\r\nwhole bent of his mind made him but an insincere ally of the priesthood,\r\nwho indeed could hardly expect to enjoy such an orgy in France as their\r\nbrethren were celebrating in Spain. The King, however, was unable to impart\r\nhis own indifference to the emigrants who returned with him, nor had he\r\nimagination enough to identify himself, as King of France, with the\r\nmilitary glories of the nation and with the democratic army that had won\r\nthem. Louis held high notions of the royal prerogative: this would not in\r\nitself have prevented him from being a successful ruler, if he had been\r\ncapable of governing in the interest of the nation at large. There were few\r\nRepublicans remaining in France; the centralised institutions of the Empire\r\nremained in full vigour; and although the last months of Napoleon's rule\r\nhad excited among the educated classes a strong spirit of constitutional\r\nopposition, an able and patriotic Bourbon accepting his new position, and\r\nwielding power for the benefit of the people and not of a class, might\r\nperhaps have exercised an authority not much inferior to that possessed by\r\nthe Crown before 1789. But Louis, though rational, was inexperienced and\r\nsupine. He was ready enough to admit into his Ministry and to retain in\r\nadministrative posts throughout the country men who had served under\r\nNapoleon; but when the emigrants and the nobles, led by the Count of\r\nArtois, pushed themselves to the front of the public service, and treated\r\nthe restoration of the Bourbons as the victory of their own order, the King\r\noffered but a faint resistance, and allowed the narrowest class-interests\r\nto discredit a monarchy whose own better traditions identified it not with\r\nan aristocracy but with the State.\r\n\r\n[The Charta.]\r\n\r\nThe Constitution promulgated by King Louis XVIII. on the 4th of June, 1814,\r\nand known as the Charta, [204] was well received by the French nation.\r\nThough far less liberal than the Constitution accepted by Louis XVI. in\r\n1791, it gave to the French a measure of representative government to which\r\nthey had been strangers under Napoleon. It created two legislative\r\nchambers, the Upper House consisting of peers who were nominated by the\r\nCrown at its pleasure, whether for life-peerages or hereditary dignity; the\r\nLower House formed by national election, but by election restricted by so\r\nhigh a property-qualification [205] that not one person in two hundred\r\npossessed a vote. The Crown reserved to itself the sole power of proposing\r\nlaws. In spite of this serious limitation of the competence of the two\r\nhouses, the Lower Chamber possessed, in its right of refusing taxes and of\r\ndiscussing and rejecting all measures laid before it, a reality of power\r\nsuch as no representative body had possessed in France since the beginning\r\nof the Consulate. The Napoleonic nobility was placed on an equality with\r\nthe old noblesse of France, though neither enjoyed, as nobles, anything\r\nmore than a titular distinction. [206] Purchasers of landed property sold\r\nby the State since the beginning of the Revolution were guaranteed in their\r\npossessions. The principles of religious freedom, of equality before the\r\nlaw, and of the admissibility of all classes to public employment, which\r\nhad taken such deep root during the Republic and the Empire, were declared\r\nto form part of the public law of France; and by the side of these\r\ndeeply-cherished rights the Charta of King Louis XVIII. placed, though in a\r\nqualified form, the long-forgotten principle of the freedom of the Press.\r\n\r\n[Encroachments of Nobles.]\r\n\r\nUnder such a Constitution there was little room for the old noblesse to\r\narrogate to itself any legal superiority over the mass of the French\r\nnation. What was wanting in law might, however, in the opinion of the Count\r\nof Artois and his friends, be effected by administration. Of all the\r\ninstitutions of France the most thoroughly national and the most thoroughly\r\ndemocratic was the army; it was accordingly against the army that the\r\nnoblesse directed its first efforts. Financial difficulties made a large\r\nreduction in the forces necessary. Fourteen thousand officers and sergeants\r\nwere accordingly dismissed on half-pay; but no sooner had this measure of\r\neconomy been effected than a multitude of emigrants who had served against\r\nthe Republic in the army of the Prince of Condé or in La Vendée were\r\nrewarded with all degrees of military rank. Naval officers who had quitted\r\nthe service of France and entered that of its enemies were reinstated with\r\nthe rank which they had held in foreign navies. [207] The tricolor, under\r\nwhich every battle of France had been fought from Jemappes to Montmartre,\r\nwas superseded by the white flag of the House of Bourbon, under which no\r\nliving soldier had marched to victory. General Dupont, known only by his\r\ncapitulation at Baylen in 1808, was appointed Minister of War. The Imperial\r\nGuard was removed from service at the Palace, and the so-called Military\r\nHousehold of the old Bourbon monarchy revived, with the privileges and the\r\ninsignia belonging to the period before 1775. Young nobles who had never\r\nseen a shot fired crowded into this favoured corps, where the musketeer and\r\nthe trooper held the rank and the pay of a lieutenant in the army. While in\r\nevery village of France some battered soldier of Napoleon cursed the\r\nGovernment that had driven him from his comrades, the Court revived at\r\nParis all the details of military ceremonial that could be gathered from\r\nold almanacks, from the records of court-tailors, and from the memories of\r\ndecayed gallants. As if to convince the public that nothing had happened\r\nduring the last twenty-two years, the aged Marquis de Chansenets, who had\r\nbeen Governor of the Tuileries on the 10th of August, 1792, and had then\r\nescaped by hiding among the bodies of the dead, [208] resumed his place at\r\nthe head of the officers of the Palace.\r\n\r\n[Encroachments of the clergy.]\r\n\r\n[Growing hostility to the Bourbons.]\r\n\r\nThese were but petty triumphs for the emigrants and nobles, but they were\r\nsufficient to make the restored monarchy unpopular. Equally injurious was\r\ntheir behaviour in insulting the families of Napoleon's generals, in\r\npersecuting men who had taken part in the great movement of 1789, and in\r\nintimidating the peasant-owners of land that had been confiscated and sold\r\nby the State. Nor were the priesthood backward in discrediting the\r\nGovernment of Louis XVIII. in the service of their own order. It might be\r\nvain to think of recovering the Church-lands, or of introducing the\r\nInquisition into France, but the Court might at least be brought to invest\r\nitself with the odour of sanctity, and the parish-priest might be made as\r\nformidable a person within his own village as the mayor or the agent of the\r\npolice-minister. Louis XVIII. was himself sceptical and self-indulgent.\r\nThis, however, did not prevent him from publishing a letter to the Bishops\r\nplacing his kingdom under the especial protection of the Virgin Mary, and\r\nfrom escorting the image of the patron-saint through the streets of Paris\r\nin a procession in which Marshal Soult and other regenerate Jacobins of the\r\nCourt braved the ridicule of the populace by acting as candle-bearers.\r\nAnother sign of the King's submission to the clergy was the publication of\r\nan edict which forbade buying and selling on Sundays and festivals.\r\n\r\nWhatever the benefits of a freely-observed day of rest, this enactment,\r\nwhich was not submitted to the Chambers, passed for an arrogant piece of\r\ninterference on the part of the clergy with national habits; and while it\r\ncaused no inconvenience to the rich, it inflicted substantial loss upon a\r\nnumerous and voluble class of petty traders. The wrongs done to the\r\nFrench nation by the priests and emigrants who rose to power in 1814 were\r\nindeed the merest trifle in comparison with the wrongs which it had\r\nuncomplainingly borne at the hands of Napoleon. But the glory of the\r\nEmpire, the strength and genius of its absolute rule, were gone. In its\r\nplace there was a family which had been dissociated from France during\r\ntwenty years, which had returned only to ally itself with an unpopular\r\nand dreaded caste, and to prove that even the unexpected warmth with\r\nwhich it had been welcomed home could not prevent it from becoming, at\r\nthe end of a few months, utterly alien and uninteresting. The indifference\r\nof the nation would not have endangered the Bourbon monarchy if the army\r\nhad been won over by the King. But here the Court had excited the\r\nbitterest enmity. The accord which for a moment had seemed possible even\r\nto Republicans of the type of Carnot had vanished at a touch. [209]\r\nRumours of military conspiracies grew stronger with every month.\r\nWellington, now British Ambassador at Paris, warned his Government of the\r\nchanged feeling of the capital, of the gatherings of disbanded officers,\r\nof possible attacks upon the Tuileries. \"The truth is,\" he wrote, \"that\r\nthe King of France without the army is no King.\" Wellington saw the more\r\nimmediate danger: [210] he failed to see the depth and universality of\r\nthe movement passing over France, which before the end of the year 1814\r\nhad destroyed the hold of the Bourbon monarchy except in those provinces\r\nwhere it had always found support, and prepared the nation at large to\r\nwelcome back the ruler who so lately seemed to have fallen for ever.\r\n\r\n[Congress of Vienna, Sept., 1814.]\r\n\r\nParis and Madrid divided for some months after the conclusion of peace the\r\nattention of the political world. At the end of September the centre of\r\nEuropean interest passed to Vienna. The great council of the Powers, so\r\nlong delayed, was at length assembled. The Czar of Russia, the Kings of\r\nPrussia, Denmark, Bavaria, and Würtemberg, and nearly all the statesmen of\r\neminence in Europe, gathered round the Emperor Francis and his Minister,\r\nMetternich, to whom by common consent the presidency of the Congress was\r\noffered. Lord Castlereagh represented England, and Talleyrand France.\r\nRasumoffsky and other Russian diplomatists acted under the immediate\r\ndirections of their master, who on some occasions even entered into\r\npersonal correspondence with the Ministers of the other Powers.\r\nHardenberg stood in a somewhat freer relation to King Frederick William;\r\nStein was present, but without official place. The subordinate envoys and\r\nattaches of the greater Courts, added to a host of petty princes and the\r\nrepresentatives who came from the minor Powers, or from communities which\r\nhad ceased to possess any political existence at all, crowded Vienna. In\r\norder to relieve the antagonisms which had already come too clearly into\r\nview, Metternich determined to entertain his visitors in the most\r\nmagnificent fashion; and although the Austrian State was bankrupt, and in\r\nsome districts the people were severely suffering, a sum of about £10,000\r\na day was for some time devoted to this purpose. The splendour and the\r\ngaieties of Metternich were emulated by his guests; and the guardians of\r\nEurope enjoyed or endured for months together a succession of fêtes,\r\nbanquets, dances, and excursions, varied, through the zeal of Talleyrand\r\nto ingratiate himself with his new master, by a Mass of great solemnity\r\non the anniversary of the execution of Louis XVI. [211] One incident\r\nlights the faded and insipid record of vanished pageants and defunct\r\ngallantries. Beethoven was in Vienna. The Government placed the great\r\nAssembly-rooms at his disposal, and enabled the composer to gratify a\r\nharmless humour by sending invitations in his own name to each of the\r\nSovereigns and grandees then in Vienna. Much personal homage, some\r\nsubstantial kindness from these gaudy creatures of the hour, made the\r\nperiod of the Congress a bright page in that wayward and afflicted life\r\nwhose poverty has enriched mankind with such immortal gifts.\r\n\r\n[Talleyrand and the four Powers.]\r\n\r\nThe Congress had need of its distractions, for the difficulties which faced\r\nit were so great that, even after the arrival of the Sovereigns, it was\r\nfound necessary to postpone the opening of the regular sittings until\r\nNovember. By the secret articles of the Peace of Paris, the Allies had\r\nreserved to themselves the disposal of all vacant territory, although their\r\nconclusions required to be formally sanctioned by the Congress at large.\r\nThe Ministers of Austria, England, Prussia, and Russia accordingly\r\ndetermined at the outset to decide upon all territorial questions among\r\nthemselves, and only after their decisions were completely formed to submit\r\nthem to France and the other Powers. [212] Talleyrand, on hearing of this\r\narrangement, protested that France itself was now one of the Allies, and\r\ndemanded that the whole body of European States should at once meet in open\r\nCongress. The four Courts held to their determination, and began their\r\npreliminary sittings without Talleyrand. But the French statesman had,\r\nunder the form of a paradox, really stated the true political situation.\r\nThe greater Powers were so deeply divided in their aims that their old bond\r\nof common interest, the interest of union against France, was now less\r\npowerful than the impulse that made them seek the support of France against\r\none another. Two men had come to the Congress with a definite aim:\r\nAlexander had resolved to gain the Duchy of Warsaw, and to form it, with or\r\nwithout some part of Russian Poland, into a Polish kingdom, attached to his\r\nown crown: Talleyrand had determined, either on the question of Poland, or\r\non the question of Saxony, which arose out of it, to break allied Europe\r\ninto halves, and to range France by the side of two of the great Powers\r\nagainst the two others. The course of events favoured for a while the\r\ndesign of the Minister: Talleyrand himself prosecuted his plan with an\r\nability which, but for the untimely return of Napoleon from Elba, would\r\nhave left France, without a war, the arbiter and the leading Power of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n[Polish question.]\r\n\r\nSince the Russian victories of 1812, the Emperor Alexander had made no\r\nsecret of his intention to restore a Polish Kingdom and a Polish\r\nnationality. [213] Like many other designs of this prince, the project\r\ncombined a keen desire for personal glorification with a real generosity of\r\nfeeling. Alexander was thoroughly sincere in his wish not only to make the\r\nPoles again a people, but to give them a Parliament and a free\r\nConstitution. The King of Poland, however, was to be no independent prince,\r\nbut Alexander himself: although the Duchy of Warsaw, the chief if not the\r\nsole component of the proposed new kingdom, had belonged to Austria and\r\nPrussia after the last partition of Poland, and extended into the heart of\r\nthe Prussian monarchy. Alexander insisted on his anxiety to atone for the\r\ncrime of Catherine in dismembering Poland: the atonement, however, was to\r\nbe made at the sole cost of those whom Catherine had allowed to share the\r\nbooty. Among the other Governments, the Ministry of Great Britain would\r\ngladly have seen a Polish State established in a really independent form;\r\n[214] failing this, it desired that the Duchy of Warsaw should be divided,\r\nas formerly, between Austria and Prussia. Metternich was anxious that the\r\nfortress of Cracow, at any rate, should not fall into the hands of the\r\nCzar. Stein and Hardenberg, and even Alexander's own Russian counsellors,\r\nearnestly opposed the Czar's project, not only on account of the claims of\r\nPrussia on Warsaw, but from dread of the agitation likely to be produced by\r\na Polish Parliament among all Poles outside the new State. King Frederick\r\nWilliam, however, was unaccustomed to dispute the wishes of his ally; and\r\nthe Czar's offer of Saxony in substitution for Warsaw gave to the Prussian\r\nMinisters, who were more in earnest than their master, at least the\r\nprospect of receiving a valuable equivalent for what they might surrender.\r\n\r\n[Saxon question.]\r\n\r\nBy the Treaty of Kalisch, made when Prussia united its arms with those of\r\nRussia against Napoleon (Feb. 27th, 1813), the Czar had undertaken to\r\nrestore the Prussian monarchy to an extent equal to that which it had\r\npossessed in 1805. It was known before the opening of the Congress that the\r\nCzar proposed to do this by handing over to King Frederick William the\r\nwhole of Saxony, whose Sovereign, unlike his colleagues in the Rhenish\r\nConfederacy, had supported Napoleon up to his final overthrow at Leipzig.\r\nSince that time the King of Saxony had been held a prisoner, and his\r\ndominions had been occupied by the Allies. The Saxon question had thus\r\nalready gained the attention of all the European Governments, and each of\r\nthe Ministers now at Vienna brought with him some more or less distinct\r\nview upon the subject. Castlereagh, who was instructed to foster the union\r\nof Prussia and Austria against Alexander's threatening ambition, was\r\nwilling that Prussia should annex Saxony if in return it would assist him\r\nin keeping Russia out of Warsaw: [215] Metternich disliked the annexation,\r\nbut offered no serious objection, provided that in Western Germany Prussia\r\nwould keep to the north of the Main: Talleyrand alone made the defence of\r\nthe King of Saxony the very centre of his policy, and subordinated all\r\nother aims to this. His instructions, like those of Castlereagh, gave\r\npriority to the Polish question; [216] but Talleyrand saw that Saxony, not\r\nPoland, was the lever by which he could throw half of Europe on to the side\r\nof France; and before the four Allied Courts had come to any single\r\nconclusion, the French statesman had succeeded, on what at first passed for\r\na subordinate point, in breaking up their concert.\r\n\r\n[Talleyrand's action on Saxony.]\r\n\r\nFor a while the Ministers of Austria, Prussia, and England appeared to be\r\nacting in harmony; and throughout the month of October all three\r\nendeavoured to shake the purpose of Alexander regarding Warsaw. [217]\r\nTalleyrand, however, foresaw that the efforts of Prussia in this direction\r\nwould not last very long, and he wrote to Louis XVIII. asking for his\r\npermission to make a definite offer of armed assistance to Austria in case\r\nof need. Events took the turn which Talleyrand expected. Early in November\r\nthe King of Prussia completely yielded to Alexander, and ordered Hardenberg\r\nto withdraw his opposition to the Russian project. Metternich thus found\r\nhimself abandoned on the Polish question by Prussia; and at the same moment\r\nthe answer of King Louis XVIII. arrived, and enabled Talleyrand to assure\r\nthe Austrian Minister that, if resistance to Russia and Prussia should\r\nbecome necessary, he might count on the support of a French army.\r\nMetternich now completely changed his position on the Saxon question, and\r\nwrote to Hardenberg (Dec. 10) stating that, inasmuch as Prussia had chosen\r\nto sacrifice Warsaw, the Emperor Francis absolutely forbade the annexation\r\nof more than a fifth part of the kingdom of Saxony. Castlereagh, disgusted\r\nwith the obstinacy of Russia and the subserviency of King Frederick\r\nWilliam, forgave Talleyrand for not supporting him earlier, and cordially\r\nentered into this new plan for thwarting the Northern Powers. The leading\r\nmember of the late Rhenish Confederacy, the King of Bavaria, threw himself\r\nwith eagerness into the struggle against Prussia and against German unity.\r\nIn proportion as Stein and the patriots of 1813 urged the claims of German\r\nnationality under Prussian leadership against the forfeited rights of a\r\nCourt which had always served on Napoleon's side, the politicians of the\r\nRhenish Confederacy declaimed against the ambition and the Jacobinism of\r\nPrussia, and called upon Europe to defend the united principles of\r\nhereditary right and of national independence in the person of the King of\r\nSaxony.\r\n\r\n[Theory of Legitimacy.]\r\n\r\nTalleyrand's object was attained. He had isolated Russia and Prussia, and\r\nhad drawn to his own side not only England and Austria but the whole body\r\nof the minor German States. Nothing was wanting but a phrase, or an idea,\r\nwhich should consecrate the new league in the opinion of Europe as a league\r\nof principle, and bind the Allies, in matters still remaining open, to the\r\nsupport of the interests of the House of Bourbon. Talleyrand had made his\r\ntheory ready. In notes to Castlereagh and Metternich, [218] he declared\r\nthat the whole drama of the last twenty years had been one great struggle\r\nbetween revolution and established right, a struggle at first between\r\nRepublicanism and Monarchy, afterwards between usurping dynasties and\r\nlegitimate dynasties. The overthrow of Napoleon had been the victory of the\r\nprinciple of legitimacy; the task of England and Austria was now to extend\r\nthe work of restitution to all Europe, and to defend the principle against\r\nnew threatened aggressions. In the note to Castlereagh, Talleyrand added a\r\npractical corollary. \"To finish the revolution, the principle of legitimacy\r\nmust triumph without exception. The kingdom of Saxony must be preserved;\r\nthe kingdom of Naples must return to its legitimate king.\"\r\n\r\n[Alliance against Russia and Prussia, Jan. 3, 1815.]\r\n\r\nAs an historical summary of the Napoleonic wars, Talleyrand's doctrine was\r\nbaseless. No one but Pitt had cared about the fate of the Bourbons; no one\r\nwould have hesitated to make peace with Napoleon, if Napoleon would have\r\naccepted terms of peace. The manifesto was not, however, intended to meet a\r\nscientific criticism. In the English Foreign Office it was correctly\r\ndescribed as a piece of drollery; and Metternich was too familiar with the\r\nlanguage of principles himself to attach much meaning to it in the mouth of\r\nanyone else. Talleyrand, however, kept a grave countenance. With inimitable\r\ncomposure the old Minister of the Directory wrote to Louis XVIII. lamenting\r\nthat Castlereagh did not appear to care much about the principle of\r\nlegitimacy, and in fact did not quite comprehend it; [219] and he added his\r\nfear that this moral dimness on the part of the English Minister arose from\r\nthe dealing of his countrymen with Tippoo Sahib. But for Europe at\r\nlarge,--for the English Liberal party, who looked upon the Saxons and the\r\nPrussians as two distinct nations, and for the Tories, who forgot that\r\nNapoleon had made the Elector of Saxony a king; for the Emperor of Austria,\r\nwho had no wish to see the Prussian frontier brought nearer to Prague;\r\nabove all, for the minor German courts who dreaded every approach towards\r\nGerman unity,--Talleyrand's watchword was the best that could have been\r\ninvented. His counsel prospered. On the 3rd of January, 1815, after a rash\r\nthreat of war uttered by Hardenberg, a secret treaty [220] was signed by\r\nthe representatives of France, England, and Austria, pledging these Powers\r\nto take the field, if necessary, against Russia and Prussia in defence of\r\nthe principles of the Peace of Paris. The plan of the campaign was drawn\r\nup, the number of the forces fixed. Bavaria had already armed; Piedmont,\r\nHanover, and even the Ottoman Porte, were named as future members of the\r\nalliance.\r\n\r\n[Compromise on Polish and Saxon questions.]\r\n\r\n[Prussia gains Rhenish Provinces.]\r\n\r\nIt would perhaps be unfair to the French Minister to believe that he\r\nactually desired to kindle a war on this gigantic scale. Talleyrand had\r\nnot, like Napoleon, a love for war for its own sake. His object was rather\r\nto raise France from its position as a conquered and isolated Power; to\r\nsurround it with allies; to make the House of Bourbon the representatives\r\nof a policy interesting to a great part of Europe; and, having thus undone\r\nthe worst results of Napoleon's rule, to trust to some future complication\r\nfor the recovery of Belgium and the frontier of the Rhine. Nor was\r\nTalleyrand's German policy adopted solely as the instrument of a passing\r\nintrigue. He appears to have had a true sense of the capacity of Prussia to\r\ntransform Germany into a great military nation; and the policy of alliance\r\nwith Austria and protection of the minor States which he pursued in 1814\r\nwas that which he had advocated throughout his career. The conclusion of\r\nthe secret treaty of January 3rd marked the definite success of his plans.\r\nFrance was forthwith admitted into the council hitherto known as that of\r\nthe Four Courts, and from this time its influence visibly affected the\r\naction of Russia and Prussia, reports of the secret treaty having reached\r\nthe Czar immediately after its signature. [221] The spirit of compromise\r\nnow began to animate the Congress. Alexander had already won a virtual\r\ndecision in his favour on the Polish question, but he abated something of\r\nhis claims, and while gaining the lion's share of the Duchy of Warsaw, he\r\nultimately consented that Cracow, which threatened the Austrian frontier,\r\nshould be formed into an independent Republic, and that Prussia should\r\nreceive the fortresses of Dantzic and Thorn on the Vistula, with the\r\ndistrict lying between Thorn and the border of Silesia. [222] This was\r\nlittle for Alexander to abandon; on the Saxon question the allies of\r\nTalleyrand gained most that they demanded. The King of Saxony was restored\r\nto his throne, and permitted to retain Dresden and about half of his\r\ndominions. Prussia received the remainder. In lieu of a further expansion\r\nin Saxony, Prussia was awarded territory on the left bank of the Rhine,\r\nwhich, with its recovered Westphalian provinces, restored the monarchy to\r\nan area and population equal to that which it had possessed in 1805. But\r\nthe dominion given to Prussia beyond the Rhine, though considered at the\r\ntime to be a poor equivalent for the second half of Saxony, was in reality\r\na gift of far greater value. It made Prussia, in defence of its own soil,\r\nthe guardian and bulwark of Germany against France. It brought an element\r\ninto the life of the State in striking contrast with the aristocratic and\r\nProtestant type predominant in the older Prussian provinces,--a Catholic\r\npopulation, liberal in its political opinions, and habituated by twenty\r\nyears' union with France to the democratic tendencies of French social\r\nlife. It gave to Prussia something more in common with Bavaria and the\r\nSouth, and qualified it, as it had not been qualified before, for its\r\nfuture task of uniting Germany under its own leadership.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon leaves Elba, Feb. 26.]\r\n\r\n[Lands in France, March 1.]\r\n\r\nThe Polish and Saxon difficulties, which had threatened the peace of\r\nEurope, were virtually settled before the end of the month of January.\r\nEarly in February Lord Castlereagh left Vienna, to give an account of his\r\nlabours and to justify his policy before the English House of Commons. His\r\nplace at the Congress was taken by the Duke of Wellington. There remained\r\nthe question of Naples, the formation of a Federal Constitution for\r\nGermany, and several matters of minor political importance, none of which\r\nendangered the good understanding of the Powers. Suddenly the action of the\r\nCongress was interrupted by the most startling intelligence. On the night\r\nof March 6th Metternich was roused from sleep to receive a despatch\r\ninforming him that Napoleon had quitted Elba. The news had taken eight days\r\nto reach Vienna. Napoleon had set sail on the 26th of February. In the\r\nsilence of his exile he had watched the progress of events in France: he\r\nhad convinced himself of the strength of the popular reaction against the\r\npriests and emigrants; and the latest intelligence which he had received\r\nfrom Vienna led him to believe that the Congress itself was on the point of\r\nbreaking up. There was at least some chance of success in an attempt to\r\nregain his throne; and, the decision once formed, Napoleon executed it with\r\ncharacteristic audacity and despatch. Talleyrand, on hearing that Napoleon\r\nhad left Elba, declared that he would only cross into Italy and there raise\r\nthe standard of Italian independence: instead of doing this, Napoleon made\r\nstraight for France, with the whole of his guard, eleven hundred in number,\r\nembarked on a little flotilla of seven ships. The voyage lasted three days:\r\nno French or English vessels capable of offering resistance met the\r\nsquadron. On the 1st of March Napoleon landed at the bay of Jouan, three\r\nmiles to the west of Antibes. A detachment of his guards called upon the\r\ncommandant of Antibes to deliver up the town to the Emperor; the commandant\r\nrefused, and the troops bivouacked that evening, with Napoleon among them,\r\nin the olive-woods by the shore of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[Moves on Grenoble.]\r\n\r\n[Troops at La Mure.]\r\n\r\nBefore daybreak began the march that was to end in Paris. Instead of\r\nfollowing the coast road of Provence, which would have brought him to\r\nToulon and Marseilles, where most of the population were fiercely Royalist,\r\n[223] and where Massena and other great officers might have offered\r\nresistance, Napoleon struck northwards into the mountains, intending to\r\ndescend upon Lyons by way of Grenoble. There were few troops in this\r\ndistrict, and no generals capable of influencing them. The peasantry of\r\nDauphiné were in great part holders of land that had been taken from the\r\nChurch and the nobles: they were exasperated against the Bourbons, and,\r\nlike the peasantry of France generally, they identified the glory of the\r\ncountry which they loved with the name and the person of Napoleon. As the\r\nlittle band penetrated into the mountains the villagers thronged around\r\nthem, and by offering their carts and horses enabled Napoleon to march\r\ncontinuously over steep and snowy roads at the rate of forty miles a day.\r\nNo troops appeared to dispute these mountain passages: it was not until the\r\nclose of the fifth day's march that Napoleon's mounted guard, pressing on\r\nin front of the marching column, encountered, in the village of La Mure,\r\ntwenty miles south of Grenoble, a regiment of infantry wearing the white\r\ncockade of the House of Bourbon. The two bodies of troops mingled and\r\nconversed in the street: the officer commanding the royal infantry fearing\r\nthe effect on his men, led them back on the road towards Grenoble.\r\nNapoleon's lancers also retired, and the night passed without further\r\ncommunication. At noon on the following day the lancers, again advancing\r\ntowards Grenoble, found the infantry drawn up to defend the road. They\r\ncalled out that Napoleon was at hand, and begged the infantry not to fire.\r\nPresently Napoleon's column came in sight; one of his _aides-de-camp_\r\nrode to the front of the royal troops, addressed them, and pointed out\r\nNapoleon. The regiment was already wavering, the officer commanding had\r\nalready given the order of retreat, when the men saw their Emperor\r\nadvancing towards them. They saw his face, they heard his voice: in another\r\nmoment the ranks were broken, and the soldiers were pressing with shouts\r\nand tears round the leader whom nature had created with such transcendent\r\ncapacity for evil, and endowed with such surpassing power of attracting\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n[Enters Grenoble, March 7.]\r\n\r\n[Declaration of his purpose.]\r\n\r\nEverything was decided by this first encounter. \"In six days,\" said\r\nNapoleon, \"we shall be in the Tuileries.\" The next pledge of victory came\r\nswiftly. Colonel Labédoyère, commander of the 7th Regiment of the Line, had\r\nopenly declared for Napoleon in Grenoble, and appeared on the road at the\r\nhead of his men a few hours after the meeting at La Mure. Napoleon reached\r\nGrenoble the same evening. The town had been in tumult all day. The Préfet\r\nfled: the general in command sent part of his troops away, and closed the\r\ngates. On Napoleon's approach the population thronged the ramparts with\r\ntorches; the gates were burst open; Napoleon was borne through the town in\r\ntriumph by a wild and intermingled crowd of soldiers and workpeople. The\r\nwhole mass of the poorer classes of the town welcomed him with enthusiasm:\r\nthe middle classes, though hostile to the Church and the Bourbons, saw too\r\nclearly the dangers to France involved in Napoleon's return to feel the\r\nsame joy. [224] They remained in the background, neither welcoming Napoleon\r\nnor interfering with the welcome offered him by others. Thus the night\r\npassed. On the morning of the next day Napoleon received the magistrates\r\nand principal inhabitants of the town, and addressed them in terms which\r\nformed the substance of every subsequent declaration of his policy. \"He had\r\ncome,\" he said, \"to save France from the outrages of the returning nobles;\r\nto secure to the peasant the possession of his land; to uphold the rights\r\nwon in 1789 against a minority which sought to re-establish the privileges\r\nof caste and the feudal burdens of the last century. France had made trial\r\nof the Bourbons: it had done well to do so; but the experiment had failed.\r\nThe Bourbon monarchy had proved incapable of detaching itself from its\r\nworst supports, the priests and nobles: only the dynasty which owed its\r\nthrone to the Revolution could maintain the social work of the Revolution.\r\nAs for himself, he had learnt wisdom by misfortune. He renounced conquest.\r\nHe should give France peace without and liberty within. He accepted the\r\nTreaty of Paris and the frontiers of 1792. Freed from the necessities which\r\nhad forced him in earlier days to found a military Empire, he recognised\r\nand bowed to the desire of the French nation for constitutional government.\r\nHe should henceforth govern only as a constitutional sovereign, and seek\r\nonly to leave a constitutional crown to his son.\"\r\n\r\n[Feeling of the various classes.]\r\n\r\n[Napoleon enters Lyons, March 10.]\r\n\r\nThis language was excellently chosen. It satisfied the peasants and the\r\nworkmen, who wished to see the nobles crushed, and it showed at least a\r\ncomprehension of the feelings uppermost in the minds of the wealthier and\r\nmore educated middle classes, the longing for peace, and the aspiration\r\ntowards political liberty. It was also calculated to temper the unwelcome\r\nimpression that an exiled ruler was being forced upon France by the\r\nsoldiery. The military movement was indeed overwhelmingly decisive, yet the\r\npopular movement was scarcely less so. The Royalists were furious, but\r\nimpotent to act; thoughtful men in all classes held back, with sad\r\napprehensions of returning war and calamity; [225] but from the time when\r\nNapoleon left Grenoble, the nation at large was on his side. There was\r\nnowhere an effective centre of resistance. The Préfets and other civil\r\nofficers appointed under the Empire still for the most part held their\r\nposts; they knew themselves to be threatened by the Bourbonist reaction,\r\nbut they had not yet been displaced; their professions of loyalty to Louis\r\nXVIII. were forced, their instincts of obedience to their old master, even\r\nif they wished to have done with him, profound. From this class, whose\r\ncowardice and servility find too many parallels in history, [226] Napoleon\r\nhad little to fear. Among the marshals and higher officers charged with the\r\ndefence of the monarchy, those who sincerely desired to serve the Bourbons\r\nfound themselves powerless in the midst of their troops. Macdonald, who\r\ncommanded at Lyons, had to fly from his men, in order to escape being made\r\na prisoner. The Count of Artois, who had come to join him, discovered that\r\nthe only service he could render to the cause of his family was to take\r\nhimself out of sight. Napoleon entered Lyons on the 10th of March, and now\r\nformally resumed his rank and functions as Emperor. His first edicts\r\nrenewed that appeal to the ideas and passions of the Revolution which had\r\nbeen the key-note of every one of his public utterances since leaving Elba.\r\nTreating the episode of Bourbon restoration as null and void, the edicts of\r\nLyons expelled from France every emigrant who had returned without the\r\npermission of the Republic or the Emperor; they drove from the army the\r\nwhole mass of officers intruded by the Government of Louis XVIII.; they\r\ninvalidated every appointment and every dismissal made in the magistracy\r\nsince the 1st of April, 1814; and, reverting to the law of the Constituent\r\nAssembly of 1789, abolished all nobility except that which had been\r\nconferred by the Emperor himself.\r\n\r\n[Marshal Ney.]\r\n\r\n[The Chambers in Paris.]\r\n\r\n[Napoleon enters Paris, March 20.]\r\n\r\nFrom this time all was over. Marshal Ney, who had set out from Paris\r\nprotesting that Napoleon deserved to be confined in an iron cage, [227]\r\nfound, when at some distance from Lyons, that the nation and army were on\r\nthe side of the Emperor, and proclaimed his own adherence to him in an\r\naddress to his troops. The two Chambers of Legislature, which had been\r\nprorogued, were summoned by King Louis XVIII. as soon as the news of\r\nNapoleon's landing reached the capital. The Chambers met on the 13th of\r\nMarch. The constitutionalist party, though they had opposed various\r\nmeasures of King Louis' Government as reactionary, were sincerely loyal to\r\nthe Charta, and hastened, in the cause of constitutional liberty, to offer\r\nto the King their cordial support in resisting Bonaparte's military\r\ndespotism. The King came down to the Legislative Chamber, and, in a scene\r\nconcerted with his brother, the Count of Artois, made, with great dramatic\r\neffect, a declaration of fidelity to the Constitution. Lafayette and the\r\nchiefs of the Parliamentary Liberals hoped to raise a sufficient force from\r\nthe National Guard of Paris to hold Napoleon in check. The project,\r\nhowever, came to nought. The National Guard, which represented the middle\r\nclasses of Paris, was decidedly in favour of the Charta and Constitutional\r\nGovernment; but it had no leaders, no fighting-organisation, and no\r\nmilitary spirit. The regular troops who were sent out against Napoleon\r\nmounted the tricolor as soon as they were out of sight of Paris, and joined\r\ntheir comrades. The courtiers passed from threats to consternation and\r\nhelplessness. On the night of March 19th King Louis fled from the\r\nTuileries. Napoleon entered the capital the next evening, welcomed with\r\nacclamations by the soldiers and populace, but not with that general\r\nrejoicing which had met him at Lyons, and at many of the smaller towns\r\nthrough which he had passed.\r\n\r\n[Congress of Vienna outlaws Napoleon.]\r\n\r\n[Napoleon's preparations for defence.]\r\n\r\nFrance was won: Europe remained behind. On the 13th of March the Ministers\r\nof all the Great Powers, assembled at Vienna, published a manifesto\r\ndenouncing Napoleon Bonaparte as the common enemy of mankind, and declaring\r\nhim an outlaw. The whole political structure which had been reared with so\r\nmuch skill by Talleyrand vanished away. France was again alone, with all\r\nEurope combined against it. Affairs reverted to the position in which they\r\nhad stood in the month of March, 1814, when the Treaty of Chaumont was\r\nsigned, which bound the Powers to sustain their armed concert against\r\nFrance, if necessary, for a period of twenty years. That treaty was now\r\nformally renewed. [228] The four great Powers undertook to employ their\r\nwhole available resources against Bonaparte until he should be absolutely\r\nunable to create disturbance, and each pledged itself to keep permanently\r\nin the field a force of at least a hundred and fifty thousand men. The\r\npresence of the Duke of Wellington at Vienna enabled the Allies to decide\r\nwithout delay upon the general plan for their invasion of France. It was\r\nresolved to group the allied troops in three masses; one, composed of the\r\nEnglish and the Prussians under Wellington and Blücher, to enter France by\r\nthe Netherlands; the two others, commanded by the Czar and Prince\r\nSchwarzenberg, to advance from the middle and upper Rhine. Nowhere was\r\nthere the least sign of political indecision. The couriers sent by Napoleon\r\nwith messages of amity to the various Courts were turned back at the\r\nfrontiers with their despatches undelivered. It was in vain for the Emperor\r\nto attempt to keep up any illusion that peace was possible. After a brief\r\ninterval he himself acquainted France with the true resolution of his\r\nenemies. The most strenuous efforts were made for defence. The old soldiers\r\nwere called from their homes. Factories of arms and ammunition began their\r\nhurried work in the principal towns. The Emperor organised with an energy\r\nand a command of detail never surpassed at any period of his life; the\r\nnature of the situation lent a new character to his genius, and evoked in\r\nthe organisation of systematic defence all that imagination and resource\r\nwhich had dazzled the world in his schemes of invasion and surprise. Nor,\r\nas hitherto, was the nation to be the mere spectator of his exploits. The\r\npopulation of France, its National Guard, its _levée en masse_, as\r\nwell as its armies and its Emperor, was to drive the foreigner from French\r\nsoil. Every operation of defensive warfare, from the accumulation of\r\nartillery round the capital to the gathering of forest-guards and\r\nfree-shooters in the thickets of the Vosges and the Ardennes, occupied in\r\nits turn the thoughts of Napoleon. [229] Had France shared his resolution\r\nor his madness, had the Allies found at the outset no chief superior to\r\ntheir Austrian leader in 1814, the war on which they were now about to\r\nenter would have been one of immense difficulty and risk, its ultimate\r\nissue perhaps doubtful.\r\n\r\n[Campaign and fall of Murat, April, 1815]\r\n\r\nBefore Napoleon or his adversaries were ready to move, hostilities broke\r\nout in Italy. Murat, King of Naples, had during the winter of 1814 been\r\nrepresented at Vienna by an envoy: he was aware of the efforts made by\r\nTalleyrand to expel him from his throne, and knew that the Government of\r\nGreat Britain, convinced of his own treachery during the pretended\r\ncombination with the Allies in 1814, now inclined to act with France. [230]\r\nThe instinct of self-preservation led him to risk everything in raising the\r\nstandard of Italian independence, rather than await the loss of his\r\nkingdom; and the return of Napoleon precipitated his fall. At the moment\r\nwhen Napoleon was about to leave Elba, Murat, who knew his intention, asked\r\nthe permission of Austria to move a body of troops through Northern Italy\r\nfor the alleged purpose of attacking the French Bourbons, who were\r\npreparing to restore his rival, Ferdinand. Austria declared that it should\r\ntreat the entry either of French or of Neapolitan troops into Northern\r\nItaly as an act of war. Murat, as soon as Napoleon's landing in France\r\nbecame known, protested to the Allies that he intended to remain faithful\r\nto them, but he also sent assurances of friendship to Napoleon, and\r\nforthwith invaded the Papal States. He acted without waiting for Napoleon's\r\ninstructions, and probably with the intention of winning all Italy for\r\nhimself even if Napoleon should victoriously re-establish his Empire. On\r\nthe 10th of April, Austria declared war against him. Murat pressed forward\r\nand entered Bologna, now openly proclaiming the unity and independence of\r\nItaly. The feeling of the towns and of the educated classes generally\r\nseemed to be in his favour, but no national rising took place. After some\r\nindecisive encounters with the Austrians, Murat retreated. As he fell back\r\ntowards the Neapolitan frontier, his troops melted away. The enterprise\r\nended in swift and total ruin; and on the 22nd of May an English and\r\nAustrian force took possession of the city of Naples in the name of King\r\nFerdinand. Murat, leaving his family behind him, fled to France, and sought\r\nin vain to gain a place by the side of Napoleon in his last great struggle,\r\nand to retrieve as a soldier the honour which he had lost as a king. [231]\r\n\r\n[The Acte Additionnel, April 23, 1815.]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his preparations for war with all Europe, Napoleon found it\r\nnecessary to give some satisfaction to that desire for liberty which was\r\nagain so strong in France. He would gladly have deferred all political\r\nchange until victory over the foreigner had restored his own undisputed\r\nascendency over men's minds; he was resolved at any rate not to be harassed\r\nby a Constituent Assembly, like that of 1789, at the moment of his greatest\r\nperil; and the action of King Louis XVIII. in granting liberty by Charta\r\ngave him a precedent for creating a Constitution by an Edict supplementary\r\nto the existing laws of the Empire. Among the Liberal politicians who had\r\ndeclared for King Louis XVIII. while Napoleon was approaching Paris, one of\r\nthe most eminent was Benjamin Constant, who had published an article\r\nattacking the Emperor with great severity on the very day when he entered\r\nthe capital. Napoleon now invited Constant to the Tuileries, assured him\r\nthat he no longer either desired or considered it possible to maintain an\r\nabsolute rule in France, and requested Constant himself to undertake the\r\ntask of drawing up a Constitution. Constant, believing the Emperor to be in\r\nsome degree sincere, accepted the proposals made to him, and, at the cost\r\nof some personal consistency, entered upon the work, in which Napoleon by\r\nno means allowed him entire freedom. [232] The result of Constant's labours\r\nwas the Decree known as the Acte Additionnel of 1815. The leading\r\nprovisions of this Act resembled those of the Charta: both professed to\r\nestablish a representative Government and the responsibility of Ministers;\r\nboth contained the usual phrases guaranteeing freedom of religion and\r\nsecurity of person and property. The principal differences were that the\r\nChamber of Peers was now made wholly hereditary, and that the Emperor\r\nabsolutely refused to admit the clause of the Charta abolishing\r\nconfiscation as a penalty for political offences. On the other hand,\r\nConstant definitely extinguished the censorship of the Press, and provided\r\nsome real guarantee for the free expression of opinion by enacting that\r\nPress-offences should be judged only in the ordinary Jury-courts. Constant\r\nwas sanguine enough to believe that the document which he had composed\r\nwould reduce Napoleon to the condition of a constitutional king. As a\r\nLiberal statesman, he pressed the Emperor to submit the scheme to a\r\nRepresentative Assembly, where it could be examined and amended. This\r\nNapoleon refused to do, preferring to resort to the fiction of a Plébiscite\r\nfor the purpose of procuring some kind of national sanction for his Edict.\r\nThe Act was published on the 23rd of April, 1815. Voting lists were then\r\nopened in all the Departments, and the population of France, most of whom\r\nwere unable to read or write, were invited to answer Yes or No to the\r\nquestion whether they approved of Napoleon's plan for giving his subjects\r\nParliamentary government.\r\n\r\n[The Chambers summoned for June.]\r\n\r\nThere would have been no difficulty in obtaining some millions of votes for\r\nany absurdity that the Emperor might be pleased to lay before the French\r\npeople; but among the educated minority who had political theories of their\r\nown, the publication of this reform by Edict produced the worst possible\r\nimpression. No stronger evidence, it was said, could have been given of the\r\nEmperor's insincerity than the dictatorial form in which he affected to\r\nbestow liberty upon France. Scarcely a voice was raised in favour of the\r\nnew Constitution. The measure had in fact failed of its effect. Napoleon's\r\nobject was to excite an enthusiasm that should lead the entire nation, the\r\neducated classes as well as the peasantry, to rally round him in a struggle\r\nwith the foreigner for life or death: he found, on the contrary, that he\r\nhad actually injured his cause. The hostility of public opinion was so\r\nserious that Napoleon judged it wise to make advances to the Liberal party,\r\nand sent his brother Joseph to Lafayette, to ascertain on what terms he\r\nmight gain his support. [233] Lafayette, strongly condemning the form of\r\nthe Acte Additionnel, stated that the Emperor could only restore public\r\nconfidence by immediately convoking the Chambers. This was exactly what\r\nNapoleon desired to avoid, until he had defeated the English and Prussians;\r\nnor in fact had the vote of the nation accepting the new Constitution yet\r\nbeen given. But the urgency of the need overcame the Emperor's inclinations\r\nand the forms of law. Lafayette's demand was granted: orders were issued\r\nfor an immediate election, and the meeting of the Chambers fixed for the\r\nbeginning of June, a few days earlier than the probable departure of the\r\nEmperor to open hostilities on the northern frontier.\r\n\r\n[Elections.]\r\n\r\nLafayette's counsel had been given in sincerity, but Napoleon gained little\r\nby following it. The nation at large had nothing of the faith in the\r\nelections which was felt by Lafayette and his friends. In some places not a\r\nsingle person appeared at the poll: in most, the candidates were elected by\r\na few scores of voters. The Royalists absented themselves on principle: the\r\npopulation generally thought only of the coming war, and let the professed\r\npoliticians conduct the business of the day by themselves. Among the\r\ndeputies chosen there were several who had sat in the earlier Assemblies of\r\nthe Revolution; and, mingled with placemen and soldiers of the Empire, a\r\nconsiderable body of men whose known object was to reduce Napoleon's power.\r\nOne interest alone was unrepresented--that of the Bourbon family, which so\r\nlately seemed to have been called to the task of uniting the old and the\r\nnew France around itself.\r\n\r\n[Champ de Mai.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon, troubling himself little about the elections, laboured\r\nincessantly at his preparations for war, and by the end of May two hundred\r\nthousand men were ready to take the field. The delay of the Allies, though\r\nnecessary, enabled their adversary to take up the offensive. It was the\r\nintention of the Emperor to leave a comparatively small force to watch the\r\neastern frontier, and himself, at the head of a hundred and twenty-five\r\nthousand men, to fall upon Wellington and Blücher in the Netherlands, and\r\ncrush them before they could unite their forces. With this object the\r\ngreater part of the army was gradually massed on the northern roads at\r\npoints between Paris, Lille, and Maubeuge. Two acts of State remained to be\r\nperformed by the Emperor before he quitted the capital; the inauguration of\r\nthe new Constitution and the opening of the Chambers of Legislature. The\r\nfirst, which had been fixed for the 26th of May, and announced as a revival\r\nof the old Frankish Champ de Mai, was postponed till the beginning of the\r\nfollowing month. On the 1st of June the solemnity was performed with\r\nextraordinary pomp and splendour, on that same Champ de Mars where,\r\ntwenty-five years before, the grandest and most affecting of all the\r\nfestivals of the Revolution, the Act of Federation, had been celebrated by\r\nKing Louis XVI. and his people. Deputations from each of the constituencies\r\nof France, from the army, and from every public body, surrounded the\r\nEmperor in a great amphitheatre enclosed at the southern end of the plain:\r\noutside there were ranged twenty thousand soldiers of the Guard and other\r\nregiments; and behind them spread the dense crowd of Paris. When the total\r\nof the votes given in the Plébiscite had been summed up and declared, the\r\nEmperor took the oath to the Constitution, and delivered one of his\r\nmasterpieces of political rhetoric. The great officers of State took the\r\noath in their turn: mass was celebrated, and Napoleon, leaving the enclosed\r\nspace, then presented their standards to the soldiery in the Champ de Mars,\r\naddressing some brief, soul-stirring word to each regiment as it passed.\r\nThe spectacle was magnificent, but except among the soldiers themselves a\r\nsense of sadness and disappointment passed over the whole assembly. The\r\nspeech of the Emperor showed that he was still the despot at heart: the\r\napplause was forced: all was felt to be ridiculous, all unreal. [234]\r\n\r\n[Plan of Napoleon.]\r\n\r\nThe opening of the Legislative Chambers took place a few days later, and on\r\nthe night of the 11th of June Napoleon started for the northern frontier.\r\nThe situation of the forces opposed to him in this his last campaign\r\nstrikingly resembled that which had given him his first Italian victory in\r\n1796. Then the Austrians and Sardinians, resting on opposite bases, covered\r\nthe approaches to the Sardinian capital, and invited the assailant to break\r\nthrough their centre and drive the two defeated wings along diverging and\r\nsevered paths of retreat. Now the English and the Prussians covered\r\nBrussels, the English resting westward on Ostend, the Prussians eastward on\r\nCologne, and barely joining hands in the middle of a series of posts nearly\r\neighty miles long. The Emperor followed the strategy of 1796. He determined\r\nto enter Belgium by the central road of Charleroi, and to throw his main\r\nforce upon Blücher, whose retreat, if once he should be severed from his\r\ncolleague, would carry him eastwards towards Liège, and place him outside\r\nthe area of hostilities round Brussels. Blücher driven eastwards, Napoleon\r\nbelieved that he might not only push the English commander out of Brussels,\r\nbut possibly, by a movement westwards, intercept him from the sea and cut\r\noff his communication with Great Britain. [235]\r\n\r\n[Situation of the armies.]\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 13th of June, the French army, numbering a hundred and\r\ntwenty-nine thousand men, had completed its concentration, and lay gathered\r\nround Beaumont and Philippeville. Wellington was at Brussels; his troops,\r\nwhich consisted of thirty-five thousand English and about sixty thousand\r\nDutch, Germans, and Belgians, [236] guarded the country west of the\r\nCharleroi road as far as Oudenarde on the Scheldt. Blücher's headquarters\r\nwere at Namur; he had a hundred and twenty thousand Prussians under his\r\ncommand, who were posted between Charleroi, Namur, and Liège. Both the\r\nEnglish and Prussian generals were aware that very large French forces had\r\nbeen brought close to the frontier, but Wellington imagined Napoleon to be\r\nstill in Paris, and believed that the war would be opened by a forward\r\nmovement of Prince Schwarzenberg into Alsace. It was also his fixed\r\nconviction that if Napoleon entered Belgium he would throw himself not upon\r\nthe Allied centre, but upon the extreme right of the English towards the\r\nsea. [237] In the course of the 14th, the Prussian outposts reported that\r\nthe French were massed round Beaumont: later in the same day there were\r\nclear signs of an advance upon Charleroi. Early next morning the attack on\r\nCharleroi began. The Prussians were driven out of it, and retreated in the\r\ndirection of Ligny, whither Blücher now brought up all the forces within\r\nhis reach. It was unknown to Wellington until the afternoon of the 15th\r\nthat the French had made any movement whatever: on receiving the news of\r\ntheir advance, he ordered a concentrating movement of all his forces\r\neastward, in order to cover the road to Brussels and to co-operate with the\r\nPrussian general. A small division of the British army took post at Quatre\r\nBras that night, and on the morning of the 16th Wellington himself rode to\r\nLigny, and promised his assistance to Blücher, whose troops were already\r\ndrawn up and awaiting the attack of the French.\r\n\r\n[Ligny, June 16.]\r\n\r\nBut the march of the invader was too rapid for the English to reach the\r\nfield of battle. Already, on returning to Quatre Bras in the afternoon,\r\nWellington found his own troops hotly engaged. Napoleon had sent Ney along\r\nthe road to Brussels to hold the English in check and, if possible, to\r\nenter the capital, while he himself, with seventy thousand men, attacked\r\nBlücher. The Prussian general had succeeded in bringing up a force superior\r\nin number to his assailants; but the French army, which consisted in a\r\ngreat part of veterans recalled to the ranks, was of finer quality than any\r\nthat Napoleon had led since the campaign of Moscow, and it was in vain that\r\nBlücher and his soldiers met them with all the gallantry and even more than\r\nthe fury of 1813. There was murderous hand-to-hand fighting in the villages\r\nwhere the Prussians had taken up their position: now the defenders, now the\r\nassailants gave way: but at last the Prussians, with a loss of thirteen\r\nthousand men, withdrew from the combat, and left the battle-field in\r\npossession of the enemy. If the conquerors had followed up the pursuit that\r\nnight, the cause of the Allies would have been ruined. The effort of battle\r\nhad, however, been too great, or the estimate which Napoleon made of his\r\nadversary's rallying power was too low. He seems to have assumed that\r\nBlücher must necessarily retreat eastwards towards Namur; while in reality\r\nthe Prussian was straining every nerve to escape northwards, and to restore\r\nhis severed communication with his ally.\r\n\r\n[Quatre Bras, June 16.]\r\n\r\nAt Quatre Bras the issue of the day was unfavourable to the French. Ney\r\nmissed his opportunity of seizing this important point before it was\r\noccupied by the British in any force; and when the battle began the British\r\ninfantry-squares unflinchingly bore the attack of Ney's cavalry, and drove\r\nthem back again and again with their volleys, until successive\r\nreinforcements had made the numbers on both sides even. At the close of the\r\nday the French marshal, baffled and disheartened, drew back his troops to\r\ntheir original position. The army-corps of General d'Erlon, which Napoleon\r\nhad placed between himself and Ney in order that it might act wherever\r\nthere was the greatest need, was first withdrawn from Ney to assist at\r\nLigny, and then, as it was entering into action at Ligny, recalled to\r\nQuatre Bras, where it arrived only after the battle was over. Its presence\r\nin either field would probably have altered the issue of the campaign.\r\n\r\n[Prussian movement.]\r\n\r\nBlücher, on the night of the 16th, lay disabled and almost senseless; his\r\nlieutenant, Gneisenau, not only saved the army, but repaired, and more than\r\nrepaired, all its losses by a memorable movement northwards that brought\r\nthe Prussians again into communication with the British. Napoleon, after an\r\nunexplained inaction during the night of the 16th and the morning of the\r\n17th, committed the pursuit of the Prussians to Marshal Grouchy, ordering\r\nhim never to let the enemy out of his sight; but Blücher and Gneisenau had\r\nalready made their escape, and had concentrated so large a body in the\r\nneighbourhood of Wavre, that Grouchy could not now have prevented a force\r\nsuperior to his own from uniting with the English, even if he had known the\r\nexact movements of each of the three armies, and, with a true presentiment\r\nof his master's danger, had attempted to rejoin him on the morrow.\r\n\r\nWellington, who had both anticipated that Blücher would be beaten at Ligny,\r\nand assured himself that the Prussian would make good his retreat\r\nnorthwards, moved on the 17th from Quatre Bras to Waterloo, now followed by\r\nNapoleon and the mass of the French army. At Waterloo he drew up for\r\nbattle, trusting to the promise of the gallant Prussian that he would\r\nadvance in that direction on the following day. Blücher, in so doing,\r\nexposed himself to the risk of having his communications severed and half\r\nhis army captured, if Napoleon should either change the direction of his\r\nmain attack and bend eastwards, or should crush Wellington before the\r\narrival of the Prussians, and seize the road from Brussels to Louvain with\r\na victorious force. Such considerations would have driven a commander like\r\nSchwarzenberg back to Liège, but they were thrown to the winds by Blücher\r\nand Gneisenau. In just reliance on his colleague's energy, Wellington, with\r\nthirty thousand English and forty thousand Dutch, Germans, and Belgians,\r\nawaited the attack of Napoleon, at the head of seventy-four thousand\r\nveteran soldiers. The English position extended two miles along the brow of\r\na gentle slope of cornfields, and crossed at right angles the great road\r\nfrom Charleroi to Brussels; the château of Hugomont, some way down the\r\nslope on the right, and the farmhouse of La Haye Sainte, on the high-road\r\nin front of the left centre, served as fortified outposts. The French\r\nformed on the opposite and corresponding slope; the country was so open\r\nthat, but for the heavy rain on the evening of the 17th, artillery could\r\nhave moved over almost any part of the field with perfect freedom.\r\n\r\n[Waterloo, June 18.]\r\n\r\nAt eleven o'clock on Sunday, the 18th of June, the battle began. Napoleon,\r\nunconscious of the gathering of the Prussians on his right, and\r\nunacquainted with the obstinacy of English troops, believed the victory\r\nalready thrown into his hands by Wellington's hardihood. His plan was to\r\nburst through the left of the English line near La Haye Sainte, and thus to\r\ndrive Wellington westwards and place the whole French army between its two\r\ndefeated enemies. The first movement was an assault on the buildings of\r\nHugomont, made for the purpose of diverting Wellington from the true point\r\nof attack. The English commander sent detachments to this outpost\r\nsufficient to defend it, but no more. After two hours' indecisive fighting\r\nand a heavy cannonade, Ney ordered D'Erlon's corps forward to the great\r\nonslaught on the centre and left. As the French column pressed up the\r\nslope, General Picton charged at the head of a brigade. The English leader\r\nwas among the first to fall, but his men drove the enemy back, and at the\r\nsame time the Scots Greys, sweeping down from the left, cut right through\r\nboth the French infantry and their cavalry supports, and, charging far up\r\nthe opposite slope, reached and disabled forty of Ney's guns, before they\r\nwere in their turn overpowered and driven back by the French dragoons. The\r\nEnglish lost heavily, but the onslaught of the enemy had totally failed,\r\nand thousands of prisoners remained behind. There was a pause in the\r\ninfantry combat; and again the artillery of Napoleon battered the English\r\ncentre, while Ney marshalled fresh troops for a new and greater effort.\r\nAbout two o'clock the attack was renewed on the left. La Haye Sainte was\r\ncarried, and vast masses of cavalry pressed up the English slope, and rode\r\nover the plateau to the very front of the English line. Wellington sent no\r\ncavalry to meet them, but trusted, and trusted justly, to the patience and\r\nendurance of the infantry themselves, who, hour after hour, held their\r\nground, unmoved by the rush of the enemy's horse and the terrible spectacle\r\nof havoc and death in their own ranks; for all through the afternoon the\r\nartillery of Napoleon poured its fire wherever the line was left open, or\r\nthe assault of the French cavalry rolled back.\r\n\r\nAt last the approach of the Prussians visibly told. Napoleon had seen their\r\nvanguard early in the day, and had detached Count Lobau with seven thousand\r\nmen to hold them in check; but the little Prussian corps gradually swelled\r\nto an army, and as the day wore on it was found necessary to reinforce\r\nCount Lobau with some of the finest divisions of the French infantry. Still\r\nreports came in of new Prussian columns approaching. At six o'clock\r\nNapoleon prepared to throw his utmost strength into one grand final attack\r\nupon the British, and to sweep them away before the battle became general\r\nwith their allies. Two columns of the Imperial Guard, supported by every\r\navailable regiment, moved from the right and left towards the English\r\ncentre. The column on the right, unchecked by the storm of Wellington's\r\ncannon-shot from front and flank, pushed to the very ridge of the British\r\nslope, and came within forty yards of the cross-road where the English\r\nGuard lay hidden. Then Wellington gave the order to fire. The French\r\nrecoiled; the English advanced at the charge, and drove the enemy down the\r\nhill, returning themselves for a while to their own position. The left\r\ncolumn of the French Guard attacked with equal bravery, and met with the\r\nsame fate. Then, while the French were seeking to re-form at the bottom of\r\nthe hill, Wellington commanded a general advance. The whole line of the\r\nBritish infantry and cavalry swept down into the valley; before them the\r\nbaffled and sorely-stricken host of the enemy broke into a confused mass;\r\nonly the battalions of the old Guard, which had halted in the rear of the\r\nattacking columns, remained firm together. Blücher, from the east, dealt\r\nthe death-blow, and, pressing on to the road by which the French were\r\nescaping, turned the defeat into utter ruin and dispersion. The pursuit,\r\nwhich Wellington's troops were too exhausted to attempt, was carried on\r\nthroughout the night by the Prussian cavalry with memorable ardour and\r\nterrible success. Before the morning the French army was no more than a\r\nrabble of fugitives.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon at Paris.]\r\n\r\n[Allies enter Paris, July 7.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon fled to Philippeville, and made some ineffectual attempts both\r\nthere and at Laon to fix a rallying point for his vanished forces. From\r\nLaon he hastened to Paris, which he reached at sunrise on the 21st. His\r\nbulletin describing the defeat of Waterloo was read to the Chambers on the\r\nsame morning. The Lower House immediately declared against the Emperor, and\r\ndemanded his abdication. Unless Napoleon seized the dictatorship his cause\r\nwas lost. Carnot and Lucien Bonaparte urged him to dismiss the Chambers and\r\nto stake all on his own strong will; but they found no support among the\r\nEmperor's counsellors. On the next day Napoleon abdicated in favour of his\r\nson. But it was in vain that he attempted to impose an absent successor\r\nupon France, and to maintain his own Ministers in power. It was equally in\r\nvain that Carnot, filled with the memories of 1793, called upon the\r\nAssembly to continue the war and to provide for the defence of Paris. A\r\nProvisional Government entered upon office. Days were spent in inaction and\r\ndebate while the Allies advanced through France. On the 28th of June, the\r\nPrussians appeared on the north of the capital; and, as the English\r\nfollowed, they moved to the south of the Seine, out of the range of the\r\nfortifications with which Napoleon had covered the side of St. Denis and\r\nMontmartre. Davoust, with almost all the generals in Paris, declared\r\ndefence to be impossible. On the 3rd of July, a capitulation was signed.\r\nThe remnants of the French army were required to withdraw beyond the Loire.\r\nThe Provisional Government dissolved itself; the Allied troops entered the\r\ncapital and on the following day the Members of the Chamber of Deputies, on\r\narriving at their Hall of Assembly, found the gates closed, and a\r\ndetachment of soldiers in possession. France was not, even as a matter of\r\nform, consulted as to its future government. Louis XVIII. was summarily\r\nrestored to his throne. Napoleon, who had gone to Rochefort with the\r\nintention of sailing to the United States, lingered at Rochefort until\r\nescape was no longer possible, and then embarked on the British ship\r\n_Bellerophon_, commending himself, as a second Themistocles, to the\r\ngenerosity of the Prince Regent of England. He who had declared that the\r\nlives of a million men were nothing to him [238] trusted to the folly or\r\nthe impotence of the English nation to provide him with some agreeable\r\nasylum until he could again break loose and deluge Europe with blood. But\r\nthe lesson of 1814 had been learnt. Some island in the ocean far beyond the\r\nequator formed the only prison for a man whom no European sovereign could\r\nventure to guard, and whom no fortress-walls could have withdrawn from the\r\nattention of mankind. Napoleon was conveyed to St. Helena. There, until at\r\nthe end of six years death removed him, he experienced some trifling share\r\nof the human misery that he had despised.\r\n\r\n[Wellington and Fouché.]\r\n\r\nVictory had come so swiftly that the Allied Governments were unprepared\r\nwith terms of peace. The Czar and the Emperor of Austria were still at\r\nHeidelberg when the battle of Waterloo was fought; they had advanced no\r\nfurther than Nancy when the news reached them that Paris had surrendered.\r\nBoth now hastened to the capital, where Wellington was already exercising\r\nthe authority to which his extraordinary successes as well as his great\r\npolitical superiority over all the representatives of the Allies then\r\npresent, entitled him. Before the entry of the English and Prussian troops\r\ninto Paris he had persuaded Louis XVIII. to sever himself from the party of\r\nreaction by calling to office the regicide Fouché, head of the existing\r\nProvisional Government. Fouché had been guilty of the most atrocious crimes\r\nat Lyons in 1793; he had done some of the worst work of each succeeding\r\ngovernment in France; and, after returning to his old place as Napoleon's\r\nMinister of Police during the Hundred Days, he had intrigued as early as\r\npossible for the restoration of Louis XVIII., if indeed he had not held\r\ntreasonable communication with the enemy during the campaign. His sole\r\nclaim to power was that every gendarme and every informer in France had at\r\nsome time acted as his agent, and that, as a regicide in office, he might\r\npossibly reconcile Jacobins and Bonapartists to the second return of the\r\nBourbon family. Such was the man whom, in association with Talleyrand, the\r\nDuke of Wellington found himself compelled to propose as Minister to Louis\r\nXVIII. The appointment, it was said, was humiliating, but it was necessary;\r\nand with the approval of the Count of Artois the King invited this\r\nblood-stained eavesdropper to an interview and placed him in office. Need\r\nsubdued the scruples of the courtiers: it could not subdue the resentment\r\nof that grief-hardened daughter of Louis XVI. whom Napoleon termed the only\r\nman of her family. The Duchess of Angoulême might have forgiven the Jacobin\r\nFouché the massacres at Lyons: she refused to speak to a Minister whom she\r\ntermed one of the murderers of her father.\r\n\r\n[Disagreement on terms of peace.]\r\n\r\nFouché had entered into a private negotiation with Wellington while the\r\nEnglish were on the outskirts of Paris, and while the authorised envoys of\r\nthe Assembly were engaged elsewhere. Wellington's motive for recommending\r\nhim to the King was the indifference or hostility felt by some of the\r\nAllies to Louis XVIII. personally, which led the Duke to believe that if\r\nLouis did not regain his throne before the arrival of the sovereigns he\r\nmight never regain it at all. [239] Fouché was the one man who could at\r\nthat moment throw open the road to the Tuileries. If his overtures were\r\nrejected, he might either permit Carnot to offer some desperate resistance\r\noutside Paris, or might retire himself with the army and the Assembly\r\nbeyond the Loire, and there set up a Republican Government. With Fouché and\r\nTalleyrand united in office under Louis XVIII., there was no fear either of\r\na continuance of the war or of the suggestion of a change of dynasty on the\r\npart of any of the Allies. By means of the Duke's independent action Louis\r\nXVIII. was already in possession when the Czar arrived at Paris, and\r\nnothing now prevented the definite conclusion of peace but the disagreement\r\nof the Allies themselves as to the terms to be exacted. Prussia, which had\r\nsuffered so bitterly from Napoleon, demanded that Europe should not a\r\nsecond time deceive itself with the hollow guarantee of a Bourbon\r\nrestoration, but should gain a real security for peace by detaching Alsace\r\nand Lorraine, as well as a line of northern fortresses, from the French\r\nmonarchy. Lord Liverpool, Prime Minister of England, stated it to be the\r\nprevailing opinion in this country that France might fairly be stripped of\r\nthe principal conquests made by Louis XIV.; but he added that if Napoleon,\r\nwho was then at large, should become a prisoner, England would waive a\r\npermanent cession of territory, on condition that France should be occupied\r\nby foreign armies until it had, at its own cost, restored the\r\nbarrier-fortresses of the Netherlands. [240] Metternich for a while held\r\nmuch the same language as the Prussian Minister: Alexander alone declared\r\nfrom the first against any reduction of the territory of France, and\r\nappealed to the declarations of the Powers that the sole object of the war\r\nwas the destruction of Napoleon and the maintenance of the order\r\nestablished by the Peace of Paris.\r\n\r\n[Arguments for and against cessions.]\r\n\r\n[Prussia isolated.]\r\n\r\n[Second Treaty of Paris, Nov. 20.]\r\n\r\nThe arguments for and against the severance of the border-provinces from\r\nFrance were drawn at great length by diplomatists, but all that was\r\nessential in them was capable of being very briefly put. On the one side,\r\nit was urged by Stein and Hardenberg that the restoration of the Bourbons\r\nin 1814 with an undiminished territory had not prevented France from\r\nplacing itself at the end of a few months under the rule of the military\r\ndespot whose life was one series of attacks on his neighbours: that the\r\nexpectation of long-continued peace, under whatever dynasty, was a vain one\r\nso long as the French possessed a chain of fortresses enabling them at any\r\nmoment to throw large armies into Germany or the Netherlands: and finally,\r\nthat inasmuch as Germany, and not England or Russia, was exposed to these\r\nirruptions, Germany had the first right to have its interests consulted in\r\nproviding for the public security. On the other side, it was argued by the\r\nEmperor Alexander, and with far greater force by the Duke of Wellington,\r\n[241] that the position of the Bourbons would be absolutely hopeless if\r\ntheir restoration, besides being the work of foreign armies, was\r\naccompanied by the loss of French provinces: that the French nation,\r\nalthough it had submitted to Napoleon, had not as a matter of fact offered\r\nthe resistance to the Allies which it was perfectly capable of offering:\r\nand that the danger of any new aggressive or revolutionary movement might\r\nbe effectually averted by keeping part of France occupied by the Allied\r\nforces until the nation had settled down into tranquillity under an\r\nefficient government. Notes embodying these arguments were exchanged\r\nbetween the Ministers of the great Powers during the months of July and\r\nAugust. The British Cabinet, which had at first inclined to the Prussian\r\nview, accepted the calm judgment of Wellington, and transferred itself to\r\nthe side of the Czar. Metternich went with the majority. Hardenberg, thus\r\nleft alone, abandoned point after point in his demands, and consented at\r\nlast that France should cede little more than the border-strips which had\r\nbeen added by the Peace of 1814 to its frontier of 1791. Chambéry and the\r\nrest of French Savoy, Landau and Saarlouis on the German side,\r\nPhilippeville and some other posts on the Belgian frontier, were fixed upon\r\nas the territory to be surrendered. The resolution of the Allied\r\nGovernments was made known to Louis XVIII. towards the end of September.\r\nNegotiation on details dragged on for two months more, while France itself\r\nunderwent a change of Ministry; and the definitive Treaty of Peace, known\r\nas the second Treaty of Paris, was not signed until November the 20th.\r\nFrance escaped without substantial loss of territory; it was, however,\r\ncompelled to pay indemnities amounting in all to about £40,000,000; to\r\nconsent to the occupation of its northern provinces by an Allied force of\r\n150,000 men for a period not exceeding five years; and to defray the cost\r\nof this occupation out of its own revenues. The works of art taken from\r\nother nations, which the Allies had allowed France to retain in 1814, had\r\nalready been restored to their rightful owners. No act of the conquerors in\r\n1815 excited more bitter or more unreasonable complaint.\r\n\r\n[Treaty of Holy Alliance, Sept. 26.]\r\n\r\nIt was in the interval between the entry of the Allies into Paris and the\r\ndefinitive conclusion of peace that a treaty was signed which has gained a\r\ncelebrity in singular contrast with its real insignificance, the Treaty of\r\nHoly Alliance. Since the terrible events of 1812 the Czar's mind had taken\r\na strongly religious tinge. His private life continued loose as before; his\r\ndevotion was both very well satisfied with itself and a prey to mysticism\r\nand imposture in others; but, if alloyed with many weaknesses, it was at\r\nleast sincere, and, like Alexander's other feelings, it naturally sought\r\nexpression in forms which seemed theatrical to stronger natures. Alexander\r\nhad rendered many public acts of homage to religion in the intervals of\r\ndiplomatic and military success in the year 1814; and after the second\r\ncapture of Paris he drew up a profession of religious and political faith,\r\nembodying, as he thought, those high principles by which the Sovereigns of\r\nEurope, delivered from the iniquities of Napoleon, were henceforth to\r\nmaintain the reign of peace and righteousness on earth. [242] This\r\ndocument, which resembled the pledge of a religious brotherhood, formed the\r\ndraft of the Treaty of the Holy Alliance. The engagement, as one binding on\r\nthe conscience, was for the consideration of the Sovereigns alone, not of\r\ntheir Ministers; and in presenting it to the Emperor Francis and King\r\nFrederick William, the Czar is said to have acted with an air of great\r\nmystery. The King of Prussia, a pious man, signed the treaty in\r\nseriousness; the Emperor of Austria, who possessed a matter-of-fact humour,\r\nsaid that if the paper related to doctrines of religion, he must refer it\r\nto his confessor, if to secrets of State, to Prince Metternich. What the\r\nconfessor may have thought of the Czar's political evangel is not known:\r\nthe opinion delivered by the Minister was not a sympathetic one. \"It is\r\nverbiage,\" said Metternich; and his master, though unwillingly, signed the\r\ntreaty. With England the case was still worse. As the Prince Regent was not\r\nin Paris, Alexander had to confide the articles of the Holy Alliance to\r\nLord Castlereagh. Of all things in the world the most incomprehensible to\r\nCastlereagh was religious enthusiasm. \"The fact is,\" he wrote home to the\r\nEnglish Premier, \"that the Emperor's mind is not completely sound.\" [243]\r\nApart, however, from the Czar's sanity or insanity, it was impossible for\r\nthe Prince Regent, or for any person except the responsible Minister, to\r\nsign a treaty, whether it meant anything or nothing, in the name of Great\r\nBritain. Castlereagh was in great perplexity. On the one hand, he feared to\r\nwound a powerful ally; on the other, he dared not violate the forms of the\r\nConstitution. A compromise was invented. The Treaty of the Holy Alliance\r\nwas not graced with the name of the Prince Regent, but the Czar received a\r\nletter declaring that his principles had the personal approval of this\r\ngreat authority on religion and morality. The Kings of Naples and Sardinia\r\nwere the next to subscribe, and in due time the names of the witty glutton,\r\nLouis XVIII., and of the abject Ferdinand of Spain were added. Two\r\npotentates alone received no invitation from the Czar to enter the League:\r\nthe Pope, because he possessed too much authority within the Christian\r\nChurch, and the Sultan, because he possessed none at all.\r\n\r\n[Treaty between the Four Powers, Nov. 20.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the history of the Treaty of Holy Alliance, of which, it may be\r\nsafely said, no single person connected with it, except the Czar and the\r\nKing of Prussia, thought without a smile. The common belief that this\r\nTreaty formed the basis of a great monarchical combination against Liberal\r\nprinciples is erroneous; for, in the first place, no such combination\r\nexisted before the year 1818; and, in the second place, the Czar, who was\r\nthe author of the Treaty, was at this time the zealous friend of Liberalism\r\nboth in his own and in other countries. The concert of the Powers was\r\nindeed provided for by articles signed on the same day as the Peace of\r\nParis; but this concert, which, unlike the Holy Alliance, included England,\r\nwas directed towards the perpetual exclusion of Napoleon from power, and\r\nthe maintenance of the established Government in France. The Allies pledged\r\nthemselves to act in union if revolution or usurpation should again\r\nconvulse France and endanger the repose of other States, and undertook to\r\nresist with their whole force any attack that might be made upon the army\r\nof occupation. The federative unity which for a moment Europe seemed to\r\nhave gained from the struggle against Napoleon, and the belief existing in\r\nsome quarters in its long continuance, were strikingly shown in the last\r\narticle of this Quadruple Treaty, which provided that, after the holding of\r\na Congress at the end of three or more years, the Sovereigns or Ministers\r\nof all the four great Powers should renew their meetings at fixed\r\nintervals, for the purpose of consulting upon their common interests, and\r\nconsidering the measures best fitted to secure the repose and prosperity of\r\nnations, and the continuance of the peace of Europe. [244]\r\n\r\n[German Federation.]\r\n\r\nThus terminated, certainly without any undue severity, yet not without some\r\nloss to the conquered nation, the work of 1815 in France. In the meantime\r\nthe Congress of Vienna, though interrupted by the renewal of war, had\r\nresumed and completed its labours. One subject of the first importance\r\nremained unsettled when Napoleon returned, the federal organisation of\r\nGermany. This work had been referred by the Powers in the autumn of 1814 to\r\na purely German committee, composed of the representatives of Austria and\r\nPrussia and of three of the Minor States; but the first meetings of the\r\ncommittee only showed how difficult was the problem, and how little the\r\ninclination in most quarters to solve it. The objects with which statesmen\r\nlike Stein demanded an effective federation were thoroughly plain and\r\npractical. They sought, in the first place, that Germany should be rendered\r\ncapable of defending itself against the foreigner; and in the second place,\r\nthat the subjects of the minor princes, who had been made absolute rulers\r\nby Napoleon, should now be guaranteed against despotic oppression. To\r\nsecure Germany from being again conquered by France, it was necessary that\r\nthe members of the League, great and small, should abandon something of\r\ntheir separate sovereignty, and create a central authority with the sole\r\nright of making war and alliances. To protect the subjects of the minor\r\nprinces from the abuse of power, it was necessary that certain definite\r\ncivil rights and a measure of representative government should be assured\r\nby Federal Law to the inhabitants of every German State, and enforced by\r\nthe central authority on the appeal of subjects against their Sovereigns.\r\nThere was a moment when some such form of German union had seemed to be\r\nclose at hand, the moment when Prussia began its final struggle with\r\nNapoleon, and the commander of the Czar's army threatened the German\r\nvassals of France with the loss of their thrones (Feb., 1813). But even\r\nthen no statesman had satisfied himself how Prussia and Austria were to\r\nunite in submission to a Federal Government; and from the time when Austria\r\nmade terms with the vassal princes little hope of establishing a really\r\neffective authority at the centre of Germany remained. Stein, at the\r\nCongress of Vienna, once more proposed to restore the title and the\r\nlong-vanished powers of the Emperor; but he found no inclination on the\r\npart of Metternich to promote his schemes for German unity, while some of\r\nthe minor princes flatly refused to abandon any fraction of their\r\nsovereignty over their own subjects. The difficulties in the way of\r\nestablishing a Federal State were great, perhaps insuperable; the statesmen\r\nanxious for it few in number; the interests opposed to it all but\r\nuniversal. Stein saw that the work was intended to be unsubstantial, and\r\nwithdrew himself from it before its completion. The Act of Federation,\r\n[245] which was signed on the 8th of June, created a Federal Diet, forbade\r\nthe members of the League to enter into alliances against the common\r\ninterest, and declared that in each State, Constitutions should be\r\nestablished. But it left the various Sovereigns virtually independent of\r\nthe League; it gave the nomination of members of the Diet to the\r\nGovernments absolutely, without a vestige of popular election; and it\r\ncontained no provision for enforcing in any individual State, whose ruler\r\nmight choose to disregard it, the principle of constitutional rule. Whether\r\nthe Federation would in any degree have protected Germany in case of attack\r\nby France or Russia is matter for conjecture, since a long period of peace\r\nfollowed the year 1815; but so far was it from securing liberty to the\r\nMinor States, that in the hands of Metternich the Diet, impotent for every\r\nother purpose, became an instrument for the persecution of liberal opinion\r\nand for the suppression of the freedom of the press.\r\n\r\n[Final Act of the Congress, June 10.]\r\n\r\nGerman affairs, as usual, were the last to be settled at the Congress; when\r\nthese were at length disposed of, the Congress embodied the entire mass of\r\nits resolutions in one great Final Act [246] of a hundred and twenty-one\r\narticles, which was signed a few days before the battle of Waterloo was\r\nfought. This Act, together with the second Treaty of Paris, formed the\r\npublic law with which Europe emerged from the warfare of a quarter of a\r\ncentury, and entered upon a period which proved, even more than it was\r\nexpected to prove, one of long-lasting peace. Standing on the boundary-line\r\nbetween two ages, the legislation of Vienna forms a landmark in history.\r\nThe provisions of the Congress have sometimes been criticised as if that\r\nbody had been an assemblage of philosophers, bent only on advancing the\r\ncourse of human progress, and endowed with the power of subduing the\r\nselfish impulses of every Government in Europe. As a matter of fact the\r\nCongress was an arena where national and dynastic interests struggled for\r\nsatisfaction by every means short of actual war. To inquire whether the\r\nCongress accomplished all that it was possible to accomplish for Europe is\r\nto inquire whether Governments at that moment forgot all their own\r\nambitions and opportunities, and thought only of the welfare of mankind.\r\nRussia would not have given up Poland without war; Austria would not have\r\ngiven up Lombardy and Venice without war. The only measures of 1814-15 in\r\nwhich the common interest was really the dominant motive were those adopted\r\neither with the view of strengthening the States immediately exposed to\r\nattack by France, or in the hope of sparing France itself the occasion for\r\nnew conflicts. The union of Holland and Belgium, and the annexation of the\r\nGenoese Republic to Sardinia, were the means adopted for the former end;\r\nfor the latter, the relinquishment of all claims to Alsace and Lorraine.\r\nThese were the measures in which the statesmen of 1814-15 acted with their\r\nhands free, and by these their foresight may fairly be judged. Of the union\r\nof Belgium to Holland it is not too much to say that, although planned by\r\nPitt, and treasured by every succeeding Ministry as one of his wisest\r\nschemes, it was wholly useless and inexpedient. The tranquillity of Western\r\nEurope was preserved during fifteen years, not by yoking together\r\ndiscordant nationalities, but by the general desire to avoid war; and as\r\nsoon as France seriously demanded the liberation of Belgium from Holland,\r\nit had to be granted. Nor can it be believed that the addition of the\r\nhostile and discontented population of Genoa to the kingdom of Piedmont\r\nwould have saved that monarchy from invasion if war had again arisen. The\r\nannexation of Genoa was indeed fruitful of results, but not of results\r\nwhich Pitt and his successors had anticipated. It was intended to\r\nstrengthen the House of Savoy for the purpose of resistance to France:\r\n[247] it did strengthen the House of Savoy, but as the champion of Italy\r\nagainst Austria. It was intended to withdraw the busy trading city Genoa\r\nfrom the influences of French democracy: in reality it brought a strong\r\nelement of innovation into the Piedmontese State itself, giving, on the one\r\nhand, a bolder and more national spirit to its Government, and, on the\r\nother hand, elevating to the ideal of a united Italy those who, like the\r\nGenoese Mazzini, were now no longer born to be the citizens of a free\r\nRepublic. In sacrificing the ancient liberty of Genoa, the Congress itself\r\nunwittingly began the series of changes which was to refute the famous\r\nsaying of Metternich, that Italy was but a geographical expression.\r\n\r\n[Alsace and Lorraine.]\r\n\r\nBut if the policy of 1814-15 in the affairs of Belgium and Piedmont only\r\nproves how little an average collection of statesmen can see into the\r\nfuture, the policy which, in spite of Waterloo, left France in possession\r\nof an undiminished territory, does no discredit to the foresight, as it\r\ncertainly does the highest honour to the justice and forbearance of\r\nWellington, whose counsels then turned the scale. The wisdom of the\r\nresolution has indeed been frequently impugned. German statesmen held then,\r\nand have held ever since, that the opportunity of disarming France once for\r\nall of its weapons of attack was wantonly thrown away. Hardenberg, when his\r\narguments for annexation of the frontier-fortresses were set aside,\r\npredicted that streams of blood would hereafter flow for the conquest of\r\nAlsace and Lorraine, [248] and his prediction has been fulfilled. Yet no\r\none perhaps would have been more astonished than Hardenberg himself, could\r\nhe have known that fifty-five years of peace between France and Prussia\r\nwould precede the next great struggle. When the same period of peace shall\r\nhave followed the acquisition of Metz and Strasburg by Prussia, it will be\r\ntime to condemn the settlement of 1815 as containing the germ of future\r\nwars; till then, the effects of that settlement in maintaining peace are\r\nentitled to recognition. It is impossible to deny that the Allies, in\r\nleaving to France the whole of its territory in 1815, avoided inflicting\r\nthe most galling of all tokens of defeat upon a spirited and still most\r\npowerful nation. The loss of Belgium and the frontier of the Rhine was\r\nkeenly enough felt for thirty years to come, and made no insignificant part\r\nof the French people ready at any moment to rush into war; how much greater\r\nthe power of the war-cry, how hopeless the task of restraint, if to the\r\nother motives for war there had been added the liberation of two of the\r\nmost valued provinces of France. Without this the danger was great enough.\r\nThrice at least in the next thirty years the balance seemed to be turning\r\nagainst the continuance of peace. An offensive alliance between France and\r\nRussia was within view when the Bourbon monarchy fell; the first years of\r\nLouis Philippe all but saw the revolutionary party plunge France into war\r\nfor Belgium and for Italy; ten years later the dismissal of a Ministry\r\nalone prevented the outbreak of hostilities on the distant affairs of\r\nSyria. Had Alsace and Lorraine at this time been in the hands of disunited\r\nGermany, it is hard to believe that the Bourbon dynasty would not have\r\naverted, or sought to avert, its fall by a popular war, or that the victory\r\nof Louis Philippe over the war-party, difficult even when there was no\r\nFrench soil to reconquer, would have been possible. The time indeed came\r\nwhen a new Bonaparte turned to enterprises of aggression the resources\r\nwhich Europe had left unimpaired to his country; but to assume that the\r\ncessions proposed in 1815 would have made France unable to move, with or\r\nwithout allies, half a century afterwards, is to make a confident guess in\r\na doubtful matter; and, with Germany in the condition in which it remained\r\nafter 1815, it is at least as likely that the annexation of Alsace and\r\nLorraine would have led to the early reconquest of the Rhenish provinces by\r\nFrance, or to a war between Austria and Prussia, as that it would have\r\nprolonged the period of European peace beyond that distant limit which it\r\nactually reached.\r\n\r\n[English efforts at the Congress to abolish the slave-trade.]\r\n\r\nAmong the subjects which were pressed upon the Congress of Vienna there was\r\none in which the pursuit of national interests and calculations of policy\r\nbore no part, the abolition of the African slave-trade. The British people,\r\nwho, after twenty years of combat in the cause of Europe, had earned so\r\ngood a right to ask something of their allies, probably attached a deeper\r\nimportance to this question than to any in the whole range of European\r\naffairs, with the single exception of the personal overthrow of Napoleon.\r\nSince the triumph of Wiberforce's cause in the Parliament of 1807, and the\r\nextinction of English slave-traffic, the anger with which the nation viewed\r\nthis detestable cruelty, too long tolerated by itself, had become more and\r\nmore vehement and widespread. By the year 1814 the utterances of public\r\nopinion were so loud and urgent that the Government, though free from\r\nenthusiasm itself, was forced to place the international prohibition of the\r\nslave-trade in the front rank of its demands. There were politicians on the\r\nContinent credulous enough to believe that this outcry of the heart and the\r\nconscience of the nation was but a piece of commercial hypocrisy.\r\nTalleyrand, with far different insight, but not with more sympathy, spoke\r\nof the state of the English people as one of frenzy. [249] Something had\r\nalready been effected at foreign courts. Sweden had been led to prohibit\r\nslave-traffic in 1813, Holland in the following year. Portugal had been\r\nrestrained by treaty from trading north of the line. France had pledged\r\nitself in the first Treaty of Paris to abolish the commerce within five\r\nyears. Spain alone remained unfettered, and it was indeed intolerable that\r\nthe English slavers should have been forced to abandon their execrable\r\ngains only that they should fall into the hands of the subjects of King\r\nFerdinand. It might be true that the Spanish colonies required a larger\r\nsupply of slaves than they possessed; but Spain had at any rate not the\r\nexcuse that it was asked to surrender an old and profitable branch of\r\ncommerce. It was solely through the abolition of the English slave-trade\r\nthat Spain possessed any slave-trade whatever. Before the year 1807 no\r\nSpanish ship had been seen on the coast of Africa for a century, except one\r\nin 1798 fitted out by Godoy. [250] As for the French trade, that had been\r\nextinguished by the capture of Senegal and Goree; and along the two\r\nthousand miles of coast from Cape Blanco to Cape Formosa a legitimate\r\ncommerce with the natives was gradually springing up in place of the\r\ndesolating traffic in flesh and blood. It was hoped by the English people\r\nthat Castlereagh would succeed in obtaining a universal and immediate\r\nprohibition of the slave-trade by all the Powers assembled at Vienna. The\r\nMinister was not wanting in perseverance, but he failed to achieve this\r\nresult. France, while claiming a short delay elsewhere, professed itself\r\nwilling, like Portugal, to abolish at once the traffic north of the line;\r\nbut the Government on which England had perhaps the greatest claim, that of\r\nSpain, absolutely refused to accept this restriction, or to bind itself to\r\na final prohibition before the end of eight years. Castlereagh then\r\nproposed that a Council of Ambassadors at London and Paris should be\r\ncharged with the international duty of expediting the close of the\r\nslave-trade; the measure which he had in view being the punishment of\r\nslave-dealing States by a general exclusion of their exports. Against this\r\nSpain and Portugal made a formal protest, treating the threat as almost\r\nequivalent to one of war. The project dropped, and the Minister of England\r\nhad to content himself with obtaining from the Congress a solemn\r\ncondemnation of the slave-trade, as contrary to the principles of\r\ncivilisation and human right (Feb., 1815).\r\n\r\nThe work was carried a step further by Napoleon's return from Elba.\r\nNapoleon understood the impatience of the English people, and believed that\r\nhe could make no higher bid for its friendship than by abandoning the\r\nreserves made by Talleyrand at the Congress, and abolishing the French\r\nslave-trade at once and for all. This was accomplished; and the Bourbon\r\nally of England, on his second restoration could not undo what had been\r\ndone by the usurper. Spain and Portugal alone continued to pursue--the\r\nformer country without restriction, the latter on the south of the line--a\r\ncommerce branded by the united voice of Europe as infamous. The Governments\r\nof these countries alleged in their justification that Great Britain itself\r\nhad resisted the passing of the prohibitory law until its colonies were far\r\nbetter supplied with slaves than those of its rivals now were. This was\r\ntrue, but it was not the whole truth. The whole truth was not known, the\r\nsincerity of English feeling was not appreciated, until, twenty years\r\nlater, the nation devoted a part of its wealth to release the slave from\r\nservitude, and the English race from the reproach of slave holding. Judged\r\nby the West Indian Emancipation of 1833, the Spanish appeal to English\r\nhistory sounds almost ludicrous. But the remembrance of the long years\r\nthroughout which the advocates of justice encountered opposition in England\r\nshould temper the severity of our condemnation of the countries which still\r\ndefended a bad interest. The light broke late upon ourselves: the darkness\r\nthat still lingered elsewhere had too long been our own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcert of Europe after 1815--Spirit of the Foreign Policy of Alexander, of\r\nMetternich, and of the English Ministry--Metternich's action in Italy,\r\nEngland's in Sicily and Spain--The Reaction in France--Richelieu and the\r\nNew Chamber--Execution of Ney--Imprisonments and persecutions--Conduct of\r\nthe Ultra-Royalists in Parliament--Contests on the Electoral Bill and the\r\nBudget--The Chamber prorogued--Affair of Grenoble--Dissolution of the\r\nChamber--Electoral Law and Financial Settlement of 1817--Character of the\r\nfirst years of peace in Europe generally--Promise of a Constitution in\r\nPrussia--Hardenberg opposed by the partisans of autocracy and\r\nprivilege--Schmalz's Pamphlet--Delay of Constitutional Reform in Germany at\r\nlarge--The Wartburg Festival--Progress of Reaction--The Czar now inclines\r\nto repression--Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle--Evacuation of France--Growing\r\ninfluence of Metternich in Europe--His action on Prussia--Murder of\r\nKotzebue--The Carlsbad Conference and measures of repression in\r\nGermany--Richelieu and Decazes--Murder of the Duke of Berry--Progress of\r\nthe reaction in France--General causes of the victory of reaction in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Concert of Europe regarding France.]\r\n\r\nFor nearly twenty years the career of Bonaparte had given to European\r\nhistory the unity of interest which belongs to a single life. This unity\r\ndoes not immediately disappear on the disappearance of his mighty figure.\r\nThe Powers of Europe had been too closely involved in the common struggle,\r\ntheir interests were too deeply concerned in the maintenance of the\r\nnewly-established order, for the thoughts of Governments to be withdrawn\r\nfrom foreign affairs, and the currents of national policy to fall at once\r\napart into separate channels. The Allied forces continued to occupy France\r\nwith Wellington as commander-in-chief; the defence of the Bourbon monarchy\r\nhad been declared the cause of Europe at large; the conditions under which\r\nthe numbers of the army of occupation might be reduced, or the period of\r\noccupation shortened, remained to be fixed by the Allies themselves. France\r\nthus formed the object of a common European deliberation; nor was the\r\nconcert of the Powers without its peculiar organ. An International Council\r\nwas created at Paris, consisting of the Ambassadors of the four great\r\nCourts. The forms of a coalition were, for the first time, preserved after\r\nthe conclusion of peace. Communications were addressed to the Government of\r\nLouis XVIII., in the name of all the Powers together. The Council of\r\nAmbassadors met at regular intervals, and not only transacted business\r\nrelating to the army of occupation and the payment of indemnities, but\r\ndiscussed the domestic policy of the French Government, and the situation\r\nof parties or the signs of political opinion in the Assembly and the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n[Action of the Powers outside France.]\r\n\r\nIn thus watching over the restored Bourbon monarchy, the Courts of Europe\r\nwere doing no more than they had bound themselves to do by treaty. Paris,\r\nhowever, was not the only field for a busy diplomacy. In most of the minor\r\ncapitals of Europe each of the Great Powers had its own supposed interests\r\nto pursue, or its own principles of government to inculcate. An age of\r\ntransition seemed to have begun. Constitutions had been promised in many\r\nStates, and created in some; in Spain and in Sicily they had reached the\r\nthird stage, that of suppression. It was not likely that the statesmen who\r\nhad succeeded to Napoleon's power in Europe should hold themselves entirely\r\naloof from the affairs of their weaker neighbours, least of all when a\r\nneighbouring agitation might endanger themselves. In one respect the\r\nintentions of the British, the Austrian, and the Russian Governments were\r\nidentical, and continued to be so, namely, in the determination to\r\ncountenance no revolutionary movement. Revolution, owing to the experience\r\nof 1793, had come to be regarded as synonymous with aggressive warfare.\r\nJacobins, anarchists, disturbers of the public peace, were only different\r\nnames for one and the same class of international criminals, who were\r\nindeed indigenous to France, but might equally endanger the peace of\r\nmankind in other countries. Against these fomenters of mischief all the\r\nCourts were at one.\r\n\r\n[Alexander.]\r\n\r\nHere, however, agreement ceased. It was admitted that between revolutionary\r\ndisturbance and the enjoyment of constitutional liberty a wide interval\r\nexisted, and the statesmen of the leading Powers held by no means the same\r\nviews as to the true relation between nations and their rulers. The most\r\nliberal in theory among the Sovereigns of 1815 was the Emperor Alexander.\r\nAlready, in the summer of 1815, he had declared the Duchy of Warsaw to be\r\nrestored to independence and nationality, under the title of the Kingdom of\r\nPoland; and before the end of the year he had granted it a Constitution,\r\nwhich created certain representative assemblies, and provided the new\r\nkingdom with an army and an administration of its own, into which no person\r\nnot a Pole could enter. The promised introduction of Parliamentary life\r\ninto Poland was but the first of a series of reforms dimly planned by\r\nAlexander, which was to culminate in the bestowal of a Constitution upon\r\nRussia itself, and the emancipation of the serf. [251] Animated by hopes\r\nlike these for his own people, hopes which, while they lasted, were not\r\nmerely sincere but ardent, Alexander was also friendly to the cause of\r\nconstitutional government in other countries. Ambition mingled with\r\ndisinterested impulses in the foreign policy of the Czar. It was impossible\r\nthat Alexander should forget the league into which England and Austria had\r\nso lately entered against him. He was anxious to keep France on his side;\r\nhe was not inclined to forego the satisfaction of weakening Austria by\r\nsupporting national hopes in Italy; [252] and he hoped to create some\r\ncounterpoise to England's maritime power by allying Russia with a\r\nstrengthened and better-administered Spain. Agents of the Czar abounded in\r\nItaly and in Germany, but in no capital was the Ambassador of Russia more\r\nactive than in Madrid. General Tatistcheff, who was appointed to this post\r\nin 1814, became the terror of all his colleagues and of the Cabinet of\r\nLondon from his extraordinary activity in intrigue; but in relation to the\r\ninternal affairs of Spain his influence was beneficial; and it was\r\nfrequently directed towards the support of reforming Ministers, whom King\r\nFerdinand, if free from foreign pressure, would speedily have sacrificed to\r\nthe pleasure of his favourites and confessors.\r\n\r\n[Metternich.]\r\n\r\n[Metternich's policy in Germany.]\r\n\r\n[In Italy.]\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of Prince Metternich, the all-powerful Minister of Austria,\r\nAlexander was little better than a Jacobin. The Austrian State, though its\r\nfrontiers had been five times changed since 1792, had continued in a\r\nremarkable degree free from the impulse to internal change. The Emperor\r\nFrancis was the personification of resistance to progress; the Minister\r\nowed his unrivalled position not more to his own skilful statesmanship in\r\nthe great crisis of 1813 than to a genuine accord with the feelings of his\r\nmaster. If Francis was not a man of intellect, Metternich was certainly a\r\nman of character; and for a considerable period they succeeded in\r\nimpressing the stamp of their own strongly-marked Austrian policy upon\r\nEurope. The force of their influence sprang from no remote source; it was\r\ndue mainly to a steady intolerance of all principles not their own.\r\nMetternich described his system with equal simplicity and precision as an\r\nattempt neither to innovate nor to go back to the past, but to keep things\r\nas they were. In the old Austrian dominions this was not difficult to do,\r\nfor things had no tendency to move and remained fixed of themselves; [253]\r\nbut on the outside, both on the north and on the south, ideas were at work\r\nwhich, according to Metternich, ought never to have entered the world, but,\r\nhaving unfortunately gained admittance, made it the task of Governments to\r\nresist their influence by all available means. Stein and the leaders of the\r\nPrussian War of Liberation had agitated Germany with hopes of national\r\nunity, of Parliaments, and of the impulsion of the executive powers of\r\nState by public opinion. Against these northern innovators, Metternich had\r\nalready won an important victory in the formation of the Federal\r\nConstitution. The weakness and timidity of the King of Prussia made it\r\nprobable that, although he was now promising his subjects a Constitution,\r\nhe might at no distant date be led to unite with other German Governments\r\nin a system of repression, and in placing Liberalism under the ban of the\r\nDiet. In Italy, according to the conservative statesman, the same dangers\r\nexisted and the same remedies were required. Austria, through the\r\nacquisition of Venice, now possessed four times as large a territory beyond\r\nthe Alps as it had possessed before 1792; but the population was no longer\r\nthe quiescent and contented folk that it had been in the days of Maria\r\nTheresa. Napoleon's kingdom and army of Italy had taught the people\r\nwarfare, and given them political aims and a more masculine spirit.\r\nMetternich's own generals had promised the Italians independence when they\r\nentered the country in 1814; Murat's raid a year later had actually been\r\nundertaken in the name of Italian unity. These were disagreeable incidents,\r\nand signs were not wanting of the existence of a revolutionary spirit in\r\nthe Italian provinces of Austria, especially among the officers who had\r\nserved under Napoleon. Metternich was perfectly clear as to the duties of\r\nhis Government. The Italians might have a Viceroy to keep Court at Milan, a\r\nbody of native officials to conduct their minor affairs, and a mock\r\nCongregation or Council, without any rights, powers, or functions whatever;\r\nif this did not satisfy them, they were a rebellious people, and government\r\nmust be conducted by means of spies, police, and the dungeons of the\r\nSpielberg. [254]\r\n\r\n[Scheme of an Austrian Protectorate over Italy.]\r\n\r\nOn this system, backed by great military force, there was nothing to fear\r\nfrom the malcontents of Lombardy and Venice: it remained for Metternich to\r\nextend the same security to the rest of the peninsula, and by a series of\r\ntreaties to effect the double end of exterminating constitutional\r\ngovernment and of establishing an Austrian Protectorate over the entire\r\ncountry, from the Alps to the Sicilian Straits. The design was so ambitious\r\nthat Metternich had not dared to disclose it at the Congress of Vienna; it\r\nwas in fact a direct violation of the Treaty of Paris, and of the\r\nresolution of the Congress, that Italy, outside the possessions of Austria,\r\nshould consist of independent States. The first Sovereign over whom the net\r\nwas cast was Ferdinand of Naples. On the 15th of June, 1815, immediately\r\nafter the overthrow of Murat, King Ferdinand signed a Treaty of Alliance\r\nwith Austria, which contained a secret clause, pledging the King to\r\nintroduce no change into his recovered kingdom inconsistent with its own\r\nold monarchical principles, or with the principles which had been adopted\r\nby the Emperor of Austria for the government of his Italian provinces.\r\n[255] Ferdinand, two years before, had been compelled by Great Britain to\r\ngrant Sicily a Constitution, and was at this very moment promising one to\r\nNaples. The Sicilian Constitution was now tacitly condemned; the\r\nNeapolitans were duped. By a further secret clause, the two contracting\r\nSovereigns undertook to communicate to one another everything that should\r\ncome to their knowledge affecting the security and tranquillity of the\r\nItalian peninsula; in other words, the spies and the police of Ferdinand\r\nwere now added to Metternich's staff in Lombardy. Tuscany, Modena, and\r\nParma entered into much the same condition of vassalage; but the scheme for\r\na universal federation of Italy under Austria's leadership failed through\r\nthe resistance of Piedmont and of the Pope. Pius VII. resented the attempts\r\nof Austria, begun in 1797 and repeated at the Congress of Vienna, to\r\ndeprive the Holy See of Bologna and Ravenna. The King of Sardinia, though\r\npressed by England to accept Metternich's offer of alliance, maintained\r\nwith great decision the independence of his country, and found in the\r\nsupport of the Czar a more potent argument than any that he could have\r\ndrawn from treaties. [256]\r\n\r\n[Spirit of England's foreign policy.]\r\n\r\nThe part played by the British Government at this epoch has been severely\r\njudged not only by the later opinion of England itself, but by the\r\nhistorical writers of almost every nation in Europe. It is perhaps\r\nfortunate for the fame of Pitt that he did not live to witness the\r\naccomplishment of the work in which he had laboured for thirteen years. The\r\nglory of a just and courageous struggle against Napoleon's tyranny remains\r\nwith Pitt; the opprobrium of a settlement hostile to liberty has fallen on\r\nhis successors. Yet there is no good ground for believing that Pitt would\r\nhave attached a higher value to the rights or inclinations of individual\r\ncommunities than his successors did in re-adjusting the balance of power;\r\non the contrary, he himself first proposed to destroy the Republic of\r\nGenoa, and to place Catholic Belgium under the Protestant Crown of Holland;\r\nnor was any principle dearer to him than that of aggrandising the House of\r\nAustria as a counterpoise to the power of France. [257] The Ministry of\r\n1815 was indeed but too faithfully walking in the path into which Pitt had\r\nbeen driven by the King and the nation in 1793. Resistance to France had\r\nbecome the one absorbing care, the beginning and end of English\r\nstatesmanship. Government at home had sunk to a narrow and unfeeling\r\nopposition to the attempts made from time to time to humanise the mass of\r\nthe people, to reform an atrocious criminal law, to mitigate the civil\r\nwrongs inflicted in the name and the interest of a State-religion. No one\r\nin the Cabinet doubted that authority, as such, must be wiser than\r\ninexperienced popular desire, least of all the statesman who now, in\r\nconjunction with the Duke of Wellington, controlled the policy of Great\r\nBritain upon the Continent. Lord Castlereagh had no sympathy with cruelty\r\nor oppression in Continental rulers; he had just as little belief in the\r\nvalue of free institutions to their subjects. [258] The nature of his\r\ninfluence, which has been drawn sometimes in too dark colours, may be\r\nfairly gathered from the course of action which he followed in regard to\r\nSicily and to Spain.\r\n\r\n[In Sicily.]\r\n\r\nIn Sicily the representative of Great Britain, Lord William Bentinck, had\r\nforced King Ferdinand, who could not have maintained himself for an hour\r\nwithout the arms and money of England, to establish in 1813 a Parliament\r\nframed on the model of our own. The Parliament had not proved a wise or a\r\ncapable body, but its faults were certainly not equal to those of King\r\nFerdinand, and its re-construction under England's auspices would have been\r\nan affair of no great difficulty. Ferdinand, however, had always detested\r\nfree institutions, and as soon as he regained the throne of Naples he\r\ndetermined to have done with the Sicilian Parliament. A correspondence on\r\nthe intended change took place between Lord Castlereagh and A'Court, the\r\nAmbassador who had now succeeded Lord William Bentinck. [259] That the\r\nBritish Government, which had protected the Sicilian Crown against Napoleon\r\nat the height of his power, could have protected the Sicilian Constitution\r\nagainst King Ferdinand's edicts without detaching a single man-of-war's\r\nboat, is not open to doubt. Castlereagh, however, who for years past had\r\nbeen paying, stimulating, or rebuking every Government in Europe, and who\r\nhad actually sent the British fleet to make the Norwegians submit to\r\nBernadotte, now suddenly adopted the principle of non-intervention, and\r\ndeclared that, so long as Ferdinand did not persecute the Sicilians who at\r\nthe invitation of England had taken part in political life, or reduce the\r\nprivileges of Sicily below those which had existed prior to 1813, Great\r\nBritain would not interfere with his action. These stipulations were\r\ninserted in order to satisfy the House of Commons, and to avert the charge\r\nthat England had not only abandoned the Sicilian Constitution, but\r\nconsented to a change which left the Sicilians in a worse condition than if\r\nEngland had never intervened in their affairs. Lord Castlereagh shut his\r\neyes to the confession involved, that he was leaving the Sicilians to a\r\nruler who, but for such restraint, might be expected to destroy every\r\nvestige of public right, and to take the same bloody and unscrupulous\r\nrevenge upon his subjects which he had taken when Nelson restored him to\r\npower in 1799.\r\n\r\n[Action of England in Spain.]\r\n\r\nThe action of the British Government in Spain showed an equal readiness to\r\ncommit the future to the wisdom of Courts. Lord Castlereagh was made\r\nacquainted with the Spanish Ferdinand's design of abolishing the\r\nConstitution on his return in the year 1814. \"So far,\" he replied, \"as the\r\nmere existence of the Constitution is at stake, it is impossible to believe\r\nthat any change tranquilly effected can well be worse.\" [260] In this case\r\nthe interposition of England would perhaps not have availed against a\r\nreactionary clergy and nation: Castlereagh, was, moreover, deceived by\r\nFerdinand's professions that he had no desire to restore absolute\r\ngovernment. He credited the King with the same kind of moderation which had\r\nled Louis XVIII. to accept the Charta in France, and looked forward to the\r\nmaintenance of a constitutional régime, though under conditions more\r\nfavourable to the executive power and to the influence of the great landed\r\nproprietors and clergy. [261] Events soon proved what value was to be\r\nattached to the word of the King; the flood of reaction and vengeance broke\r\nover the country; and from this time the British Government, half\r\nconfessing and half excusing Ferdinand's misdeeds, exerted itself to check\r\nthe outrages of despotism, and to mitigate the lot of those who were now\r\nits victims. In the interest of the restored monarchies themselves, as much\r\nas from a regard to the public opinion of Great Britain, the Ambassadors of\r\nEngland urged moderation upon all the Bourbon Courts. This, however, was\r\nalso done by Metternich, who neither took pleasure in cruelty, nor desired\r\nto see new revolutions produced by the extravagances of priests and\r\nemigrants. It was not altogether without cause that the belief arose that\r\nthere was little to choose, in reference to the constitutional liberties of\r\nother States, between the sentiments of Austria and those of the Ministers\r\nof free England. A difference, however, did exist. Metternich actually\r\nprohibited the Sovereigns over whom his influence extended from granting\r\ntheir subjects liberty: England, believing the Sovereigns to be more\r\nliberal than they were, did not interfere to preserve constitutions from\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\n[Outrages of the Royalists in the south of France, June-August.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the general character of the influence now exercised by the three\r\nleading Powers of Europe. Prussia, which had neither a fleet like England,\r\nan Italian connection like Austria, nor an ambitious Sovereign like Russia,\r\nconcerned itself little with distant States, and limited its direct action\r\nto the affairs of France, in which it possessed a substantial interest,\r\ninasmuch as the indemnities due from Louis XVIII. had yet to be paid. The\r\npossibility of recovering these sums depended upon the maintenance of peace\r\nand order in France; and from the first it was recognised by every\r\nGovernment in Europe that the principal danger to peace and order arose\r\nfrom the conduct of the Count of Artois and his friends, the party of\r\nreaction. The counterrevolutionary movement began in mere riot and outrage.\r\nNo sooner had the news of the battle of Waterloo reached the south of\r\nFrance than the Royalist mob of Marseilles drove the garrison out of the\r\ntown, and attacked the quarter inhabited by the Mameluke families whom\r\nNapoleon had brought from Egypt. Thirteen of these unfortunate persons, and\r\nabout as many Bonapartist citizens, were murdered. [262] A few weeks later\r\nNismes was given over to anarchy and pillage. Religious fanaticism here\r\nstimulated the passion of political revenge. The middle class in Nismes\r\nitself and a portion of the surrounding population were Protestant, and had\r\nhailed Napoleon's return from Elba as a deliverance from the ascendancy of\r\npriests, and from the threatened revival of the persecutions which they had\r\nsuffered under the old Bourbon monarchy. The Catholics, who were much more\r\nnumerous, included the lowest class in the town, the larger landed\r\nproprietors of the district, and above half of the peasantry. Bands of\r\nvolunteers had been formed by the Duke of Angoulême at the beginning of the\r\nHundred Days, in the hope of sustaining a civil war against Napoleon. After\r\ncapitulating to the Emperor's generals, some companies had been attacked by\r\nvillagers and hunted down like wild beasts. The bands now reassembled and\r\nentered Nismes. The garrison, after firing upon them, were forced to give\r\nup their arms, and in this defenceless state a considerable number of the\r\nsoldiers were shot down (July 17). On the next day the leaders of the armed\r\nmob began to use their victory. For several weeks murder and outrage,\r\ndeliberately planned and publicly announced, kept not only Nismes itself,\r\nbut a wide extent of the surrounding country in constant terror. The\r\nGovernment acted slowly and feebly; the local authorities were intimidated;\r\nand, in spite of the remonstrances of Wellington and the Russian\r\nAmbassador, security was not restored until the Allies took the matter into\r\ntheir own hands, and a detachment of Austrian troops occupied the\r\nDepartment of the Gard. Other districts in the south of France witnessed\r\nthe same outbreaks of Royalist ferocity. Avignon was disgraced by the\r\nmurder of Marshal Brune, conqueror of the Russians and English in the Dutch\r\ncampaign of 1799, an honest soldier, who after suffering Napoleon's neglect\r\nin the time of prosperity, had undertaken the heavy task of governing\r\nMarseilles during the Hundred Days. At Toulouse, General Ramel, himself a\r\nRoyalist, was mortally wounded by a band of assassins, and savagely\r\nmutilated while lying disabled and expiring.\r\n\r\n[Elections of 1815.]\r\n\r\nCrimes like these were the counterpart of the September massacres of 1792;\r\nand the terrorism exercised by the Royalists in 1815 has been compared, as\r\na whole, with the Republican Reign of Terror twenty-two years earlier. But\r\nthe comparison does little credit to the historical sense of those who\r\nsuggested it. The barbarities of 1815 were strictly local: shocking as they\r\nwere, they scarcely amounted in all to an average day's work of Carrier or\r\nFouché in 1794; and the action of the established Government, though\r\nculpably weak, was not itself criminal. A second and more dangerous stage\r\nof reaction began, however, when the work of popular vengeance closed.\r\nElections for a new Chamber of Deputies were held at the end of August. The\r\nLiberals and the adherents of Napoleon, paralysed by the disasters of\r\nFrance and the invaders' presence, gave up all as lost: the Ministers of\r\nLouis XVIII. abstained from the usual electoral manoeuvres, Talleyrand\r\nthrough carelessness, Fouché from a desire to see parties evenly balanced:\r\nthe ultra-Royalists alone had extended their organisation over France, and\r\nthrew themselves into the contest with the utmost passion and energy.\r\nNumerically weak, they had the immense forces of the local administration\r\non their side. The Préfets had gone over heart and soul to the cause of the\r\nCount of Artois, who indeed represented to them that he was acting under\r\nthe King's own directions. The result was that an Assembly was elected to\r\nwhich France has seen only one parallel since, namely in the Parliament of\r\n1871, elected when invaders again occupied the country, and the despotism\r\nof a second Bonaparte had ended in the same immeasurable calamity. The bulk\r\nof the candidates returned were country gentlemen whose names had never\r\nbeen heard of in public life since 1789, men who had resigned themselves to\r\ninaction and obscurity under the Republic and the Empire, and whose one\r\npolitical idea was to reverse the injuries done by the Revolution to their\r\ncaste and to their Church. They were Royalists because a Bourbon monarchy\r\nalone could satisfy their claims: they called themselves ultra-Royalists,\r\nbut they were so only in the sense that they required the monarchy to\r\nrecognise no ally but themselves. They had already shown before Napoleon's\r\nreturn that their real chief was the Count of Artois, not the King; in what\r\nform their ultra-Royalism would exhibit itself in case the King should not\r\nsubmit to be their instrument remained to be proved.\r\n\r\n[Fall of Talleyrand and Fouché.]\r\n\r\n[Richelieu's Ministry, Sept., 1815.]\r\n\r\nThe first result of the elections was the downfall of Talleyrand's Liberal\r\nMinistry. The Count of Artois and the courtiers, who had been glad enough\r\nto secure Fouché's services while their own triumph was doubtful, now\r\njoined in the outcry of the country gentlemen again this monster of\r\niniquity. Talleyrand promptly disencumbered himself of his old friend, and\r\nprepared to meet the new Parliament as an ultra-Royalist; but in the eyes\r\nof the victorious party Talleyrand himself, the married priest and the\r\nreputed accomplice in the murder of the Duke of Enghien, was little better\r\nthan his regicide colleague; and before the Assembly met he was forced to\r\nretire from power.\r\n\r\n[Richelieu's Ministry, Sept. 1815.]\r\n\r\nHis successor, the Duc de Richelieu, was recommended to Louis XVIII. by the\r\nCzar. Richelieu had quitted France early in the Revolution, and, unlike\r\nmost of the emigrants, had played a distinguished part in the country which\r\ngave him refuge. Winning his first laurels in the siege of Ismail under\r\nSuvaroff, he had subsequently been made Governor of the Euxine provinces of\r\nRussia, and the flourishing town of Odessa had sprung up under his rule.\r\nHis reputation as an administrator was high; his personal character\r\nsingularly noble and disinterested. Though the English Government looked at\r\nfirst with apprehension upon a Minister so closely connected with the Czar\r\nof Russia, Richelieu's honesty and truthfulness soon gained him the respect\r\nof every foreign Court. His relation to Alexander proved of great service\r\nto France in lightening the burden of the army of occupation; his equity,\r\nhis acquaintance with the real ends of monarchical government, made him,\r\nthough no lover of liberty, a valuable Minister in face of an Assembly\r\nwhich represented nothing but the passions and the ideas of a reactionary\r\nclass. But Richelieu had been too long absent from France to grasp the\r\ndetails of administration with a steady hand. The men, the parties of 1815,\r\nwere new to him: it is said that he was not acquainted by sight with most\r\nof his colleagues when he appointed them to their posts. The Ministry in\r\nconsequence was not at unity within itself. Some of its members, like\r\nDecazes, were more liberal than their chief; others, like Clarke and\r\nVaublanc, old servants of Napoleon now turned ultra-Royalists, were eager\r\nto make themselves the instruments of the Count of Artois, and to carry\r\ninto the work of government the enthusiasm of revenge which had already\r\nfound voice in the elections.\r\n\r\n[Violence of the Chamber of 1815.]\r\n\r\nThe session opened on the 7th of October. Twenty-nine of the peers, who had\r\njoined Napoleon during the Hundred Days, were excluded from the House, and\r\nreplaced by adherents of the Bourbons; nevertheless the peers as a body\r\nopposed themselves to extreme reaction, and, in spite of Chateaubriand's\r\nsanguinary harangues, supported the moderate policy of Richelieu against\r\nthe majority of the Lower House. The first demand of the Chamber of\r\nDeputies was for retribution upon traitors; [263] their first conflict with\r\nthe Government of Louis XVIII. arose upon the measures which were brought\r\nforward by the Ministry for the preservation of public security and the\r\npunishment of seditious acts. The Ministers were attacked, not because\r\ntheir measures were too severe, but because they were not severe enough.\r\nWhile taking power to imprison all suspected persons without trial, or to\r\nexpel them from their homes, Decazes, the Police-Minister, proposed to\r\npunish incitements to sedition by fines and terms of imprisonment varying\r\naccording to the gravity of the offence. So mild a penalty excited the\r\nwrath of men whose fathers and brothers had perished on the guillotine.\r\nSome cried out for death, others for banishment to Cayenne. When it was\r\npointed out that the infliction of capital punishment for the mere attempt\r\nat sedition would place this on a level with armed rebellion, it was\r\nanswered that a distinction might be maintained by adding in the latter\r\ncase the ancient punishment of parricide, the amputation of the hand.\r\nExtravagances like this belonged rather to the individuals than to a party;\r\nbut the vehemence of the Chamber forced the Government to submit to a\r\nrevision of its measure. Transportation to Cayenne, but not death, was\r\nultimately included among the penalties for seditious acts. The Minister of\r\nJustice, M. Barbé-Marbois, who had himself been transported to Cayenne by\r\nthe Jacobins in 1797, was able to satisfy the Chamber from his own\r\nexperience that they were not erring on the side of mercy. [264]\r\n\r\n[Ney executed, Dec. 7.]\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of these heated debates that Marshal Ney was brought to\r\ntrial for high treason. A so-called Edict of Amnesty had been published by\r\nthe King on the 24th of July, containing the names of nineteen persons who\r\nwere to be tried by courts-martial on capital charges, and of thirty-eight\r\nothers who were to be either exiled or brought to justice, as the Chamber\r\nmight determine. Ney was included in the first category. Opportunities for\r\nescape had been given to him by the Government, as indeed they had to\r\nalmost every other person on the list. King Louis XVIII. well understood\r\nthat his Government was not likely to be permanently strengthened by the\r\nexecution of some of the most distinguished men in France; the emigrants,\r\nhowever, and especially the Duchess of Angoulême, were merciless, and the\r\nEnglish Government acted a deplorable part. \"One can never feel that the\r\nKing is secure on his throne,\" wrote Lord Liverpool, \"until he has dared to\r\nspill traitors' blood.\" It is not that many examples would be necessary;\r\nbut the daring to make a few will alone manifest any strength in the\r\nGovernment. [265] Labédoyère had already been executed. On the 9th of\r\nNovember Ney was brought before a court-martial, at which Castlereagh and\r\nhis wife had the bad taste to be present. The court-martial, headed by\r\nNey's old comrade Jourdan, declared itself incompetent to judge a peer of\r\nFrance accused of high treason, [266] Ney was accordingly tried before the\r\nHouse of Peers. The verdict was a foregone conclusion, and indeed the legal\r\nguilt of the Marshal could hardly be denied. Had the men who sat in\r\njudgment upon him been a body of Vendean peasants who had braved fire and\r\nsword for the Bourbon cause, the sentence of death might have been\r\npronounced with pure, though stern lips: it remains a deep disgrace to\r\nFrance that among the peers who voted not only for Ney's condemnation but\r\nfor his death, there were some who had themselves accepted office and pay\r\nfrom Napoleon during the Hundred Days. A word from Wellington would still\r\nhave saved the Marshal's life, but in interceding for Ney the Duke would\r\nhave placed himself in direct opposition to the action of his own\r\nGovernment. When the Premier had dug the grave, it was not for Wellington\r\nto rescue the prisoner. It is permissible to hope that he, who had so\r\nvehemently reproached Blücher for his intention to put Napoleon to death if\r\nhe should fall into his hands, would have asked clemency for Ney had he\r\nconsidered himself at liberty to obey the promptings of his own nature. The\r\nresponsibility for Marshal Ney's death rests, more than upon any other\r\nindividual, upon Lord Liverpool.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of December the sentence was executed. Ney was shot at early\r\nmorning in an unfrequented spot, and the Government congratulated itself\r\nthat it had escaped the dangers of a popular demonstration and heard the\r\nlast of a disagreeable business. Never was there a greater mistake. No\r\ncrime committed in the Reign of Terror attached a deeper popular opprobrium\r\nto its authors than the execution of Ney did to the Bourbon family. The\r\nvictim, a brave but rough half-German soldier, [267] rose in popular legend\r\nalmost to the height of the Emperor himself. His heroism in the retreat\r\nfrom Moscow became, and with justice, a more glorious memory than Davoust's\r\nvictory at Jena or Moreau's at Hohenlinden. Side by side with the thought\r\nthat the Bourbons had been brought back by foreign arms, the remembrance\r\nsank deep into the heart of the French people that this family had put to\r\ndeath \"the bravest of the brave.\" It would have been no common good fortune\r\nfor Louis XVIII. to have pardoned or visited with light punishment a great\r\nsoldier whose political feebleness had led him to an act of treason,\r\ncondoned by the nation at large. Exile would not have made the transgressor\r\na martyr. But the common sense of mankind condemns Ney's execution: the\r\npublic opinion of France has never forgiven it.\r\n\r\n[Amnesty Bill, Dec 8.]\r\n\r\nOn the day after the great example was made, Richelieu brought forward the\r\nAmnesty Bill of the Government in the House of Representatives. The King,\r\nwhile claiming full right of pardon, desired that the Chamber should be\r\nassociated with him in its exercise, and submitted a project of law\r\nsecuring from prosecution all persons not included in the list published on\r\nJuly 24th. Measures of a very different character had already been\r\nintroduced under the same title into the Chamber. Though the initiative in\r\nlegislation belonged by virtue of the Charta to the Crown, resolutions\r\nmight be moved by members in the shape of petition or address, and under\r\nthis form the leaders of the majority had drawn up schemes for the\r\nwholesale proscription of Napoleon's adherents. It was proposed by M. la\r\nBourdonnaye to bring to trial all the great civil and military officers\r\nwho, during the Hundred Days, had constituted the Government of the\r\nusurper; all generals, préfets, and commanders of garrisons, who had obeyed\r\nNapoleon before a certain day, to be named by the Assembly; and all voters\r\nfor the death of Louis XVI. who had recognised Napoleon by signing the Acte\r\nAdditionnel. The language in which these prosecutions were urged was the\r\necho of that which had justified the bloodshed of 1793; its violence was\r\ndue partly to the fancy that Napoleon's return was no sudden and unexpected\r\nact, but the work of a set of conspirators in high places, who were still\r\nplotting the overthrow of the monarchy. [268]\r\n\r\n[Persecution of suspected persons over all France.]\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that Richelieu intervened with the expression of the King's\r\nown wishes, and recalled the example of forgiveness shown in the testament\r\nof Louis XVI. The committee which was appointed to report on the projects\r\nof amnesty brought up a scheme little different from that of La\r\nBourdonnaye, and added to it the iniquitous proposal that civil actions\r\nshould be brought against all condemned persons for the damages sustained\r\nby the State through Napoleon's return. This was to make a mock of the\r\nclause in the Charta which abolished confiscation. The report of the\r\ncommittee caused the utmost dismay both in France itself and among the\r\nrepresentatives of foreign Powers at Paris. The conflict between the men of\r\nreaction and the Government had openly broken out; Richelieu's Ministry,\r\nthe guarantee of peace, seemed to be on the point of falling. On the 2nd of\r\nJanuary, 1816, the Chamber proceeded to discuss the Bill of the Government\r\nand the amendments of the committee. The debate lasted four days; it was\r\nonly by the repeated use of the King's own name that the Ministers\r\nsucceeded in gaining a majority of nine votes against the two principal\r\ncategories of exception appended to the amnesty by their opponents. The\r\nproposal to restore confiscation under the form of civil actions was\r\nrejected by a much greater majority, but on the vote affecting the\r\nregicides the Government was defeated. This indeed was considered of no\r\ngreat moment. Richelieu, content with having averted measures which would\r\nhave exposed several hundred persons to death, exile, or pecuniary ruin,\r\nconsented to banish from France the regicides who had acknowledged\r\nNapoleon, along with the thirty-eight persons named in the second list of\r\nJuly 24th. Among other well-known men, Carnot, who had rendered such great\r\nservices to his country, went to die in exile. Of the seventeen companions\r\nof Ney and Labédoyère in the first list of July 24th, most had escaped from\r\nFrance; one alone suffered death. [269] But the persons originally excluded\r\nfrom the amnesty and the regicides exiled by the Assembly formed but a\r\nsmall part of those on whom the vengeance of the Royalists fell; for it was\r\nprovided that the amnesty-law should apply to no one against whom\r\nproceedings had been taken before the formal promulgation of the law. The\r\nprisons were already crowded with accused persons, who thus remained\r\nexposed to punishment; and after the law had actually passed the Chamber,\r\ntelegraph-signals were sent over the country by Clarke, the Minister of\r\nWar, ordering the immediate accusation of several others. One distinguished\r\nsoldier at least, General Travot, was sentenced to death on proceedings\r\nthus instituted between the passing and the promulgation of the law of\r\namnesty. [270] Executions, however, were not numerous except in the south\r\nof France, but an enormous number of persons were imprisoned or driven from\r\ntheir homes, some by judgment of the law-courts, some by the exercise of\r\nthe powers conferred on the administration by the law of Public Security.\r\n[271] The central government indeed had less part in this species of\r\npersecution than the Préfets and other local authorities, though within\r\ntheir own departments Clarke and Vaublanc set an example which others were\r\nnot slow to follow. Royalist committees were formed all over the country,\r\nand assumed the same kind of irregular control over the officials of their\r\ndistricts as had been practised by the Jacobin committees of 1793.\r\nThousands of persons employed in all grades of the public service, in\r\nschools and colleges as well as in the civil administration, in the\r\nlaw-courts as well as in the army and navy, were dismissed from their\r\nposts. The new-comers were professed agents of the reaction; those who were\r\npermitted to retain their offices strove to outdo their colleagues in their\r\nrenegade zeal for the new order. It was seen again, as it had been seen\r\nunder the Republic and under the Empire, that if virtue has limits,\r\nservility has none. The same men who had hunted down the peasant for\r\nsheltering his children from Napoleon's conscription now hunted down those\r\nwho were stigmatised as Bonapartists. The clergy threw in their lot with\r\nthe victorious party, and denounced to the magistrates their parishioners\r\nwho treated them with disrespect. [272] Darker pages exist in French\r\nhistory than the reaction of 1815, none more contemptible. It is the\r\ndeepest condemnation of the violence of the Republic and the despotism of\r\nthe Empire that the generation formed by it should have produced the class\r\nwho could exhibit, and the public who could tolerate, the prodigies of\r\nbaseness which attended the second Bourbon restoration.\r\n\r\n[The reactionists adopt Parliamentary theory.]\r\n\r\nWithin the Chamber of Deputies the Ultra-Royalist majority had gained\r\nParliamentary experience in the debates on the Amnesty Bill and the Law of\r\nPublic Security: their own policy now took a definite shape, and to\r\noutbursts of passion there succeeded the attempt to realise ideas. Hatred\r\nof the Revolution and all its works was still the dominant impulse of the\r\nAssembly; but whatever may have been the earlier desire of the\r\nUltra-Royalist noblesse, it was no longer their intention to restore the\r\npolitical system that existed before 1789. They would in that case have\r\ndesired to restore absolute monarchy, and to surrender the power which\r\nseemed at length to have fallen into the hands of their own class. With\r\nArtois on the throne this might have been possible, for Artois, though heir\r\nto the crown, was still what he had been in his youth, the chief of a\r\nparty: with Louis XVIII. and Richelieu at the head of the State, the\r\nUltra-Royalists became the adversaries of royal prerogative and the\r\nchampions of the rights of Parliament. Before the Revolution the noblesse\r\nhad possessed privileges; it had not possessed political power. The\r\nConstitution of 1814 had unexpectedly given it, under representative forms,\r\nthe influence denied to it under the old monarchy. New political vistas\r\nopened; and the men who had hitherto made St. Louis and Henry IV. the\r\nsubject of their declamations, now sought to extend the rights of\r\nParliament to the utmost, and to perpetuate in succeeding assemblies the\r\nrule of the present majority. An electoral law favourable to the great\r\nlanded proprietors was the first necessity. This indeed was but a means to\r\nan end; another and a greater end might be attained directly, the\r\nrestoration of a landed Church, and of the civil and social ascendancy of\r\nthe clergy.\r\n\r\n[Ecclesiastical schemes of the reaction.]\r\n\r\nIt had been admitted by King Louis XVIII. that the clause in the Charta\r\nrelating to elections required modification, and on this point the\r\nUltra-Royalists in the Chamber were content to wait for the proposals of\r\nthe Government. In their ecclesiastical policy they did not maintain the\r\nsame reserve. Resolutions in favour of the State-Church were discussed in\r\nthe form of petitions to be presented to the Crown. It was proposed to make\r\nthe clergy, as they had been before the Revolution, the sole keepers of\r\nregisters of birth and marriage; to double the annual payment made to them\r\nby the State; to permit property of all kinds to be acquired by the Church\r\nby gift or will; to restore all Church lands not yet sold by the State;\r\nand, finally, to abolish the University of France, and to place all schools\r\nand colleges throughout the country under the control of the Bishops. One\r\ncentral postulate not only passed the Chamber, but was accepted by the\r\nGovernment and became law. Divorce was absolutely abolished; and for two\r\ngenerations after 1816 no possible aggravation of wrong sufficed in France\r\nto release either husband or wife from the mockery of a marriage-tie. The\r\npower to accept donations or legacies was granted to the clergy, subject,\r\nhowever, in every case to the approval of the Crown. The allowance made to\r\nthem out of the revenues of the State was increased by the amount of\r\ncertain pensions as they should fall in, a concession which fell very far\r\nshort of the demands of the Chamber. In all, the advantages won for the\r\nChurch were scarcely proportioned to the zeal displayed in its cause. The\r\nmost important question, the disposal of the unsold Church lands, remained\r\nto be determined when the Chamber should enter upon the discussion of the\r\nBudget.\r\n\r\n[Electoral Bill, Dec. 18, 1815.]\r\n\r\nThe Electoral Bill of the Government, from which the Ultra-Royalists\r\nexpected so much, was introduced at the end of the year 1815. It showed in\r\na singular manner the confusion of ideas existing within the Ministry as to\r\nthe nature of the Parliamentary liberty now supposed to belong to France.\r\nThe ex-préfet Vaublanc, to whom the framing of the measure was entrusted,\r\nthough he imagined himself purged from the traditions of Napoleonism, could\r\nconceive of no relation between the executive and the legislative power but\r\nthat which exists between a substance and its shadow. It never entered his\r\nmind that the representative institutions granted by the Charta were\r\nintended to bring an independent force to bear upon the Government, or that\r\nthe nation should be treated as more than a fringe round the compact and\r\nlasting body of the administration. The language in which Vaublanc\r\nintroduced his measure was grotesquely candid. Montesquieu, he said, had\r\npointed out that powers must be subordinate; therefore the electoral power\r\nmust be controlled by the King's Government. [273] By the side of the\r\nelectors in the Canton and the Department there was accordingly placed, in\r\nthe Ministerial scheme, an array of officials numerous enough to carry the\r\nelections, if indeed they did not actually outnumber the private voters.\r\nThe franchise was confined to the sixty richest persons in each Canton:\r\nthese, with the officials of the district, were to elect the voters of the\r\nDepartment, who, with a similar contingent of officials, were to choose the\r\nDeputies. Re-affirming the principle laid down in the Constitution of 1795\r\nand repeated in the Charta, Vaublanc proposed that a fifth part of the\r\nAssembly should retire each year.\r\n\r\n[Counter-project of Villèle.]\r\n\r\nIf the Minister had intended to give the Ultra-Royalists the best possible\r\nmeans of exalting the peculiar policy of their class into something like a\r\nreal defence of liberty, he could not have framed a more fitting measure.\r\nThe creation of constituent bodies out of mayors, crown-advocates, and\r\njustices of the peace, was described, and with truth, as a mere Napoleonic\r\njuggle. The limitation of the franchise to a fixed number of rich persons\r\nwas condemned as illiberal and contrary to the spirit of the Charta: the\r\nsystem of yearly renovation by fifths, which threatened to curtail the\r\nreign of the present majority, was attributed to the dread of any complete\r\nexpression of public opinion. It was evident that the Bill of the\r\nGovernment would either be rejected or altered in such a manner as to give\r\nit a totally different character. In the Committee of the Chamber which\r\nundertook the task of drawing up amendments, the influence was first felt\r\nof a man who was soon to become the chief and guiding spirit of the\r\nUltra-Royalist party. M. de Villèle, spokesman of the Committee, had in his\r\nyouth been an officer in the navy of Louis XVI. On the dethronement of the\r\nKing he had quitted the service, and settled in the Isle of Bourbon, where\r\nhe gained some wealth and an acquaintance with details of business and\r\nfinance rare among the French landed gentry. Returning to France under the\r\nEmpire, he took up his abode near Toulouse, his native place, and was made\r\nMayor of that city on Napoleon's second downfall. Villèle's politics gained\r\na strong and original colour from his personal experience and the character\r\nof the province in which he lived. The south was the only part of France\r\nknown to him. There the reactionary movement of 1815 had been a really\r\npopular one, and the chief difficulty of the Government, at the end of the\r\nHundred Days, had been to protect the Bonapartists from violence. Villèle\r\nbelieved that throughout France the wealthier men among the peasantry were\r\nas ready to follow the priests and nobles as they were in Provence and La\r\nVendée. His conception of the government of the future was the rule of a\r\nlanded aristocracy, resting, in its struggle against monarchical\r\ncentralisation and against the Liberalism of the middle class, on the\r\nconservative and religious instincts of the peasantry. Instead of excluding\r\npopular forces, Villèle welcomed them as allies. He proposed to lower the\r\nfranchise to one-sixth of the sum named in the Charta, and, while retaining\r\na system of double-election, to give a vote in the primary assemblies to\r\nevery Frenchman paying annual taxes to the amount of fifty francs. In\r\nconstituencies so large as to include all the more substantial peasantry,\r\nwhile sufficiently limited to exclude the ill-paid populace in towns,\r\nVillèle believed that the Church and the noblesse would on the whole\r\ncontrol the elections. In the interest of the present majority he rejected\r\nthe system of renovation by fifths proposed by the Government, and demanded\r\nthat the present Chamber should continue unchanged until its dissolution,\r\nand the succeeding Chamber be elected entire.\r\n\r\n[Result of debates on Electoral Bill.]\r\n\r\nVillèle's scheme, if carried, would in all probability have failed at the\r\nfirst trial. The districts in which the reaction of 1815 was popular were\r\nnot so large as he supposed: in the greater part of France the peasantry\r\nwould not have obeyed the nobles except under intimidation. This was\r\nsuspected by the majority, in spite of the confident language in which they\r\nspoke of the will of the nation as identical with their own. Villèle's\r\nboldness alarmed them: they anticipated that these great constituencies of\r\npeasants, if really left masters of the elections, would be more likely to\r\nreturn a body of Jacobins and Bonapartists than one of hereditary\r\nlandlords. It was not necessary, however, to sacrifice the well-sounding\r\nprinciple of a low franchise, for the democratic vote at the first stage of\r\nthe elections might effectively be neutralised by putting the second stage\r\ninto the hands of the chief proprietors. The Assembly had in fact only to\r\nimitate the example of the Government, and to appoint a body of persons who\r\nshould vote, as of right, by the side of the electors chosen in the primary\r\nassemblies. The Government in its own interest had designated a troop of\r\nofficials as electors: the Assembly, on the contrary, resolved that in the\r\nElectoral College of each Department, numbering in all about 150 persons,\r\nthe fifty principal landowners of the Department should be entitled to\r\nvote, whether they had been nominated by the primary constituencies or not.\r\nModified by this proviso, the project of Villèle passed the Assembly. The\r\nGovernment saw that under the disguise of a series of amendments a measure\r\ndirectly antagonistic to their own had been carried. The franchise had been\r\naltered; the real control of the elections placed in the hands of the very\r\nparty which was now in open opposition to the King and his Ministers. No\r\ncompromise was possible between the law proposed by the Government and that\r\npassed by the Assembly. The Government appealed to the Chamber of Peers.\r\nThe Peers threw out the amendments of the Lower House. A provisional\r\nmeasure was then introduced by Richelieu for the sake of providing France\r\nwith at least some temporary rule for the conduct of elections. It failed;\r\nand the constitutional legislation of the country came to a dead-lock,\r\nwhile the Government and the Assembly stood face to face, and it became\r\nevident that one or the other must fall. The Ministers of the Great Powers\r\nat Paris, who watched over the restored dynasty, debated whether or not\r\nthey should recommend the King to resort to the extreme measure of a\r\ndissolution.\r\n\r\n[Contest on the Budget.]\r\n\r\n[The Chambers prorogued, April 29.]\r\n\r\nThe Electoral Bill was not the only object of conflict between Richelieu's\r\nMinistry and the Chamber, nor indeed the principal one. The Budget excited\r\nfiercer passions, and raised greater issues. It was for no mere scheme of\r\nfinance that the Government had to fight, but against a violation of public\r\nfaith which would have left France insolvent and creditless in the face of\r\nthe Powers who still held its territory in pledge. The debt incurred by the\r\nnation since 1813 was still unfunded. That part of it which had been raised\r\nbefore the summer of 1814 had been secured by law upon the unsold forests\r\nformerly belonging to the Church, and upon the Communal lands which\r\nNapoleon had made the property of the State: the remainder, which included\r\nthe loans made during the Hundred Days, had no specified security. It was\r\nnow proposed by the Government to place the whole of the unfunded debt upon\r\nthe same level, and to provide for its payment by selling the so-called\r\nChurch forests. The project excited the bitterest opposition on the side of\r\nthe Count of Artois and his friends. If there was one object which the\r\nclerical and reactionary party pursued with religious fervour, it was the\r\nrestoration of the Church lands: if there was one class which they had no\r\nscruple in impoverishing, it was the class that had lent money to Napoleon.\r\nInstead of paying the debts of the State, the Committee of the Chamber\r\nproposed to repeal the law of September, 1814, which pledged the Church\r\nforests, and to compel both the earlier and the later holders of the\r\nunfunded debt to accept stock in satisfaction of their claims, though the\r\nstock was worth less than two-thirds of its nominal value. The resolution\r\nwas in fact one for the repudiation of a third part of the unfunded debt.\r\nRichelieu, seeing in what fashion his measure was about to be transformed,\r\ndetermined upon withdrawing it altogether: the majority in the Chamber,\r\nintent on executing its own policy and that of the Count of Artois, refused\r\nto recognise the withdrawal. Such a step was at once an insult and a\r\nusurpation of power. So great was the scandal and alarm caused by the\r\nscenes in the Chamber, that the Duke of Wellington, at the instance of the\r\nAmbassadors, presented a note to King Louis XVIII. requiring him in plain\r\nterms to put a stop to the machinations of his brother. [274] The\r\ninterference of the foreigner provoked the Ultra-Royalists, and failed to\r\nexcite energetic action on the part of King Louis, who dreaded the sour\r\ncountenance of the Duchess of Angoulême more than he did Wellington's\r\nreproofs. In the end the question of a settlement of the unfunded debt was\r\nallowed to remain open. The Government was unable to carry the sale of the\r\nChurch forests, the Chamber did not succeed in its project of confiscation.\r\nThe Budget for the year, greatly altered in the interest of the landed\r\nproprietors, was at length brought into shape. A resolution of the Lower\r\nHouse restoring the unsold forests to the Church was ignored by the Crown;\r\nand the Government, having obtained the means of carrying on the public\r\nservices, gladly abstained from further legislation, and on the 29th of\r\nApril ended the turmoil which surrounded it by proroguing the Chambers.\r\n\r\n[Rising at Grenoble, May 6th. Executions.]\r\n\r\nIt was hoped that with the close of the Session the system of imprisonment\r\nand surveillance which prevailed in the Departments would be brought to an\r\nend. Vaublanc, the Minister of coercion, was removed from office. But the\r\ntroubles of France were not yet over. On the 6th of May, a rising of\r\npeasants took place at Grenoble. According to the report of General\r\nDonnadieu, commander of the garrison, which brought the news to the\r\nGovernment, the revolt had only been put down after the most desperate\r\nfighting. \"The corpses of the King's enemies,\" said the General in his\r\ndespatch, \"cover all the roads for a league round Grenoble.\" [275] It was\r\nsoon known that twenty-four prisoners had been condemned to death by\r\ncourt-martial, and sixteen of these actually executed: the court-martial\r\nrecommended the other eight to the clemency of the Government. But the\r\ndespatches of Donnadieu had thrown the Cabinet into a panic. Decazes, the\r\nmost liberal of the Ministers, himself signed the hasty order requiring the\r\nremaining prisoners to be put to death. They perished; and when it was too\r\nlate the Government learnt that Donnadieu's narrative was a mass of the\r\ngrossest exaggerations, and that the affair which he had represented as an\r\ninsurrection of the whole Department was conducted by about 300 peasants,\r\nhalf of whom were unarmed. The violence and illegality with which the\r\nGeneral proceeded to establish a régime of military law soon brought him\r\ninto collision with the Government. He became the hero of the\r\nUltra-Royalists; but the Ministry, which was unwilling to make a public\r\nconfession that it had needlessly put eight persons to death, had to bear\r\nthe odium of an act of cruelty for which Donnadieu was really responsible.\r\nThe part into which Decazes had been entrapped probably strengthened the\r\ndetermination of this Minister, who was now gaining great influence over\r\nthe King, to strike with energy against the Ultra-Royalist faction. From\r\nthis time he steadily led the King towards the only measure which could\r\nfree the country from the rule of the Count of Artois and the\r\nreactionists--the dissolution of Parliament.\r\n\r\n[Decazes.]\r\n\r\n[Dissolution of the Chamber, Sept. 5, 1816.]\r\n\r\nLouis XVIII. depended much on the society of some personal favourite.\r\nDecazes was young and an agreeable companion; his business as\r\nPolice-Minister gave him the opportunity of amusing the King with anecdotes\r\nand gossip much more congenial to the old man's taste than discussions on\r\nfinance or constitutional law. Louis came to regard Decazes almost as a\r\nson, and gratified his own studious inclination by teaching him English.\r\nThe Minister's enemies said that he won the King's heart by taking private\r\nlessons from some obscure Briton, and attributing his extraordinary\r\nprogress to the skill of his royal master. But Decazes had a more effective\r\nretort than witticism. He opened the letters of the Ultra-Royalists and\r\nlaid them before the King. Louis found that these loyal subjects jested\r\nupon his infirmities, called him a dupe in the hands of Jacobins, and\r\ngrumbled at him for so long delaying the happy hour when Artois should\r\nascend the throne. Humorous as Louis was, he was not altogether pleased to\r\nread that he \"ought either to open his eyes or to close them for ever.\" At\r\nthe same time the reports of Decazes' local agents proved that the\r\nUltra-Royalist party were in reality weak in numbers and unpopular\r\nthroughout the greater part of the country. The project of a dissolution\r\nwas laid before the Ministers and some of the King's confidants. Though the\r\nAmbassadors were not consulted on the measure, it was certain that they\r\nwould not resist it. No word of the Ministerial plot reached the rival camp\r\nof Artois. The King gained courage, and on the 5th of September signed the\r\nOrdonnance which appealed from the Parliament to the nation, and, to the\r\nanger and consternation of the Ultra-Royalists, made an end of the\r\nintractable Chamber a few weeks before the time which had been fixed for\r\nits re-assembling.\r\n\r\n[Electoral law, 1817.]\r\n\r\nFrance was well rid of a body of men who had been elected at a moment of\r\ndespair, and who would either have prolonged the occupation of the country\r\nby foreign armies, or have plunged the nation into civil war. The elections\r\nwhich followed were favourable to the Government. The questions fruitlessly\r\nagitated in the Assembly of 1815 were settled to the satisfaction of the\r\npublic in the new Parliament. An electoral law was passed, which, while it\r\nretained the high franchise fixed by the Charta, and the rule of renewing\r\nthe Chamber by fifths, gave life and value to the representative system by\r\nmaking the elections direct. Though the constituent body of all France\r\nscarcely numbered under this arrangement a hundred thousand persons, it was\r\nextensive enough to contain a majority hostile to the reactionary policy of\r\nthe Church and the noblesse. The men who had made wealth by banking,\r\ncommerce, or manufactures, the so-called higher bourgeoisie, greatly\r\nexceeded in number the larger landed proprietors; and although they were\r\nnot usually democratic in their opinions, they were liberal, and keenly\r\nattached to the modern as against the old institutions of France, inasmuch\r\nas their industrial interests and their own personal importance depended\r\nupon the maintenance of the victory won in 1789 against aristocratic\r\nprivilege and monopoly. So strong was the hostility between the civic\r\nmiddle class and the landed noblesse, that the Ultra-Royalists in the\r\nChamber sought, as they had done in the year before, to extend the\r\nfranchise to the peasantry, in the hope of overpowering wealth with\r\nnumbers. The electoral law, however, passed both Houses in the form in\r\nwhich it had been drawn up by the Government. Though deemed narrow and\r\noligarchical by the next generation, it was considered, and with justice,\r\nas a great victory won by liberalism at the time. The middle class of Great\r\nBritain had to wait for fifteen years before it obtained anything like the\r\nweight in the representation given to the middle class of France by the law\r\nof 1817.\r\n\r\n[Establishment of financial credit.]\r\n\r\nNot many of the persons who had been imprisoned under the provisional acts\r\nof the last year now remained in confinement. It was considered necessary\r\nto prolong the Laws of Public Security, and they were re-enacted, but under\r\na much softened form. It remained for the new Chamber to restore the\r\nfinancial credit of the country by making some equitable arrangement for\r\nsecuring the capital and paying the interest of the unfunded debt. Projects\r\nof repudiation now gained no hearing. Richelieu consented to make an annual\r\nallowance to the Church, equivalent to the rental of the Church forests;\r\nbut the forests themselves were made security for the debt, and the power\r\nof sale was granted to the Government. Pending such repayment of the\r\ncapital, the holders of unfunded debt received stock, calculated at its\r\nreal, not at its titular, value. The effect of this measure was at once\r\nevident. The Government was enabled to enter into negotiations for a loan,\r\nwhich promised it the means of paying the indemnities due to the foreign\r\nPowers. On this payment depended the possibility of withdrawing the army of\r\noccupation. Though Wellington at first offered some resistance, thirty\r\nthousand men were removed in the spring of 1817; and the Czar allowed\r\nRichelieu to hope that, if no further difficulties should arise, the\r\ncomplete evacuation of French territory might take place in the following\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n[Character of the years 1816-18.]\r\n\r\nThus the dangers with which reactionary passion had threatened France\r\nappeared to be passing away. The partial renovation of the Chamber which\r\ntook place in the autumn of 1817 still further strengthened the Ministry of\r\nRichelieu and weakened the Ultra-Royalist opposition. A few more months\r\npassed, and before the third anniversary of Waterloo, the Czar was ready to\r\nadvise the entire withdrawal of foreign armies from France. An invitation\r\nwas issued to the Powers to meet in Conference at Aix-la-Chapelle. There\r\nwas no longer any doubt that the five years' occupation, contemplated when\r\nthe second Treaty of Paris was made, would be abandoned. The good will of\r\nAlexander, the friendliness of his Ambassador, Pozzo di Borgo, who, as a\r\nnative of Corsica, had himself been a French subject, and who now aspired\r\nto become Minister of France, were powerful influences in favour of Louis\r\nXVIII. and his kingdom; much, however, of the speedy restoration of\r\nconfidence was due to the temperate rule of Richelieu. The nation itself,\r\nfar from suffering from Napoleon's fall, regained something of the\r\nspontaneous energy so rich in 1789, so wanting at a later period. The cloud\r\nof military disaster lifted; new mental and political life began; and under\r\nthe dynasty forced back by foreign arms France awoke to an activity unknown\r\nto it while its chief gave laws to Europe. Parliamentary debate offered the\r\nmeans of legal opposition to those who bore no friendship to the Court:\r\nconspiracy, though it alarmed at the moment, had become the resort only of\r\nthe obscure and the powerless. Groups of able men were gathering around\r\nrecognised leaders, or uniting in defence of a common political creed. The\r\nPress, dumb under Napoleon except for purposes of sycophancy, gradually\r\nbecame a power in the land. Even the dishonest eloquence of Chateaubriand,\r\nenforcing the principles of legal and constitutional liberty on behalf of a\r\nparty which would fain have used every weapon of despotism in its own\r\ninterest, proved that the leaden weight that had so long crushed thought\r\nand expression existed no more.\r\n\r\n[Prussia after 1815.]\r\n\r\n[Edict promising a Constitution, May 22, 1815.]\r\n\r\nBut if the years between 1815 and 1819 were in France years of hope and\r\nprogress, it was not so with Europe generally. In England they were years\r\nof almost unparalleled suffering and discontent; in Italy the rule of\r\nAustria grew more and more anti-national; in Prussia, though a vigorous\r\nlocal and financial administration hastened the recovery of the\r\nimpoverished land, the hopes of liberty declined beneath the reviving\r\nenergy of the nobles and the resistance of the friends of absolutism. When\r\nStein had summoned the Prussian people to take up arms for their\r\nFatherland, he had believed that neither Frederick William nor Alexander\r\nwould allow Prussia to remain without free institutions after the battle\r\nwas won. The keener spirits in the War of Liberation had scarcely\r\ndistinguished between the cause of national independence and that of\r\ninternal liberty. They returned from the battle-fields of Saxony and France,\r\nknowing that the Prussian nation had unsparingly offered up life and wealth\r\nat the call of patriotism, and believing that a patriot-king would rejoice\r\nto crown his triumph by inaugurating German freedom. For a while the hope\r\nseemed near fulfilment. On the 22nd of May, 1815, Frederick William\r\npublished an ordinance, declaring that a Representation of the People\r\nshould be established. [276] For this end the King stated that the existing\r\nProvincial Estates should be re-organised, and new ones founded where none\r\nexisted, and that out of the Provincial Estates the Assembly of\r\nRepresentatives of the country should be chosen. It was added that a\r\ncommission would be appointed, to organise under Hardenberg's presidency\r\nthe system of representation, and to draw up a written Constitution. The\r\nright of discussing all legislative measures affecting person or property\r\nwas promised to the Assembly. Though foreign affairs seemed to be directly\r\nexcluded from parliamentary debate, and the language of the Edict suggested\r\nthat the representative body would only have a consultative voice, without\r\nthe power either of originating or of rejecting laws, these reservations\r\nonly showed the caution natural on the part of a Government divesting\r\nitself for the first time of absolute power. Guarded as it was, the scheme\r\nlaid down by the King would hardly have displeased the men who had done the\r\nmost to make constitutional rule in Prussia possible.\r\n\r\n[Resistance of feudal and autocratic parties.]\r\n\r\nBut the promise of Frederick William was destined to remain unfulfilled. It\r\nwas no good omen for Prussia that Stein, who had rendered such glorious\r\nservices to his country and to all Europe, was suffered to retire from\r\npublic life. The old court-party at Berlin, politicians who had been forced\r\nto make way for more popular men, landowners who had never pardoned the\r\nliberation of the serf, all the interests of absolutism and class-privilege\r\nwhich had disappeared for a moment in the great struggle for national\r\nexistence, gradually re-asserted their influence over the King, and\r\nundermined the authority of Hardenberg, himself sinking into old age amid\r\ncircumstances of private life that left to old age little of its honour. To\r\ndecide even in principle upon the basis to be given to the new Prussian\r\nConstitution would have taxed all the foresight and all the constructive\r\nskill of the most experienced statesman; for by the side of the ancient\r\ndominion of the Hohenzollerns there were now the Rhenish and the Saxon\r\nProvinces, alien in spirit and of doubtful loyalty, in addition to Polish\r\nterritory and smaller German districts acquired at intervals between 1792\r\nand 1815. Hardenberg was right in endeavouring to link the Constitution\r\nwith something that had come down from the past; but the decision that the\r\nGeneral Assembly should be formed out of the Provincial Estates was\r\nprobably an injudicious one; for these Estates, in their present form, were\r\nmainly corporations of nobles, and the spirit which animated them was at\r\nonce the spirit of class-privilege and of an intensely strong localism.\r\nHardenberg had not only occasioned an unnecessary delay by basing the\r\nrepresentative system upon a reform of the Provincial Estates, but had\r\nexposed himself to sharp attacks from these very bodies, to whom nothing\r\nwas more odious than the absorption of their own dignity by a General\r\nAssembly. It became evident that the process of forming a Constitution\r\nwould be a tedious one; and in the meantime the opponents of the popular\r\nmovement opened their attack upon the men and the ideas whose influence in\r\nthe war of Liberation appeared to have made so great a break between the\r\nGerman present and the past.\r\n\r\n[Schmalz's pamphlet, 1815.]\r\n\r\nThe first public utterance of the reaction was a pamphlet issued in July,\r\n1815, by Schmalz, a jurist of some eminence, and brother-in-law of\r\nScharnhorst, the re-organiser of the army. Schmalz, contradicting a\r\nstatement which attributed to him a highly honourable part in the patriotic\r\nmovement of 1808, attacked the Tugendbund, and other political associations\r\ndating from that epoch, in language of extreme violence. In the stiff and\r\nperemptory manner of the old Prussian bureaucracy, he denied that popular\r\nenthusiasm had anything whatever to do with the victory of 1813, [277]\r\nattributing the recovery of the nation firstly to its submission to the\r\nFrench alliance in 1812, and secondly to the quiet sense of duty with\r\nwhich, when the time came, it took up arms in obedience to the King. Then,\r\npassing on to the present aims of the political societies, he accused them\r\nof intending to overthrow all established governments, and to force unity\r\nupon Germany by means of revolution, murder, and pillage. Stein was not\r\nmentioned by name, but the warning was given to men of eminence who\r\nencouraged Jacobinical societies, that in such combinations the giants end\r\nby serving the dwarfs. Schmalz's pamphlet, which was written with a\r\nstrength and terseness of style very unusual in Germany, made a deep\r\nimpression, and excited great indignation in Liberal circles. It was\r\nanswered, among other writers, by Niebuhr; and the controversy thickened\r\nuntil King Frederick William, in the interest of public tranquillity,\r\nordered that no more should be said on either side. It was in accordance\r\nwith Prussian feeling that the King should thus interfere to stop the\r\nquarrels of his subjects. There would have been nothing unseemly in an act\r\nof impartial repression. But the King made it impossible to regard his act\r\nas of this character. Without consulting Hardenberg, he conferred a\r\ndecoration upon the author of the controversy. Far-sighted men saw the true\r\nbearing of the act. They warned Hardenberg that, if he passed over this\r\nslight, he would soon have to pass over others more serious, and urged him\r\nto insist upon the removal of the counsellors on whose advice the King had\r\nacted. [278] But the Minister disliked painful measures. He probably\r\nbelieved that no influence could ever supplant his own with the King, and\r\nlooked too lightly upon the growth of a body of opponents, who, whether in\r\nopen or in concealed hostility to himself, were bent upon hindering the\r\nfulfilment of the constitutional reforms which he had at heart.\r\n\r\n[The promised Constitutions delayed in Germany.]\r\n\r\nIn the Edict of the 22nd of May, 1815, the King had ordered that the work\r\nof framing a Constitution should be begun in the following September.\r\nDelays, however, arose; and when the commission was at length appointed,\r\nits leading members were directed to travel over the country in order to\r\ncollect opinions upon the form of representation required. Two years passed\r\nbefore even this preliminary operation began. In the meantime very little\r\nprogress had been made towards the establishment of constitutional\r\ngovernment in Germany at large. One prince alone, the Grand Duke of Weimar,\r\nalready eminent in Europe from his connection with Goethe and Schiller,\r\nloyally accepted the idea of a free State, and brought representative\r\ninstitutions into actual working. In Hesse, the Elector summoned the\r\nEstates, only to dismiss them with contumely when they resisted his\r\nextortions. In most of the minor States contests or negotiations took place\r\nbetween the Sovereigns and the ancient Orders, which led to little or no\r\nresult. The Federal Diet, which ought to have applied itself to the\r\ndetermination of certain principles of public right common to all Germany,\r\nremained inactive. Though hope had not yet fallen, a sense of discontent\r\narose, especially among the literary class which had shown such enthusiasm\r\nin the War of Liberation. It was characteristic of Germany that the demand\r\nfor free government came not from a group of soldiers, as in Spain, not\r\nfrom merchants and men of business, as in England, but from professors and\r\nstudents, and from journalists, who were but professors in another form.\r\nThe middle class generally were indifferent: the higher nobility, and the\r\nknights who had lost their semi-independence in 1803, sought for the\r\nrestoration of privileges which were really incompatible with any\r\nState-government whatever. The advocacy of constitutional rule and of\r\nGerman unity was left, in default of Prussian initiative, to the ardent\r\nspirits of the Universities and the Press, who naturally exhibited in the\r\ntreatment of political problems more fluency than knowledge, and more zeal\r\nthan discretion. Jena, in the dominion of the Duke of Weimar, became, on\r\naccount of the freedom of printing which existed there, the centre of the\r\nnew Liberal journalism. Its University took the lead in the Teutonising\r\nmovement which had been inaugurated by Fichte twelve years before in the\r\ndays of Germany's humiliation, and which had now received so vigorous an\r\nimpulse from the victory won over the foreigner.\r\n\r\n[The Wartburg Festival, Oct., 1817.]\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of October, 1817, the students of Jena, with deputations from\r\nall the Protestant Universities of Germany, held a festival at Eisenach, to\r\ncelebrate the double anniversary of the Reformation and of the battle of\r\nLeipzig. Five hundred young patriots, among them scholars who had been\r\ndecorated for bravery at Waterloo, bound their brows with oak-leaves, and\r\nassembled within the venerable hall of Luther's Wartburg Castle; sang,\r\nprayed, preached, and were preached to; dined; drank to German liberty, the\r\njewel of life, to Dr. Martin Luther, the man of God, and to the Grand Duke\r\nof Saxe-Weimar; then descended to Eisenach, fraternised with the Landsturm\r\nin the market-place, and attended divine service in the parish church\r\nwithout mishap. In the evening they edified the townspeople with\r\ngymnastics, which were now the recognised symbol of German vigour, and\r\nlighted a great bonfire on the hill opposite the castle. Throughout the\r\nofficial part of the ceremony a reverential spirit prevailed; a few rash\r\nwords were, however, uttered against promise-breaking kings, and some of\r\nthe hardier spirits took advantage of the bonfire to consign to the flames,\r\nin imitation of Luther's dealing with the Pope's Bull, a quantity of what\r\nthey deemed un-German and illiberal writings. Among these was Schmalz's\r\npamphlet. They also burnt a soldier's strait-jacket, a pigtail, and a\r\ncorporal's cane, emblems of the military brutalism of past times which were\r\nnow being revived in Westphalia. [279] Insignificant as the whole affair\r\nwas, it excited a singular alarm not only in Germany but at foreign Courts.\r\nRichelieu wrote from Paris to inquire whether revolution was breaking out.\r\nThe King of Prussia sent Hardenberg to Weimar to make investigations on the\r\nspot. Metternich, who saw conspiracy and revolution everywhere and in\r\neverything, congratulated himself that his less sagacious neighbours were\r\nat length awakening to their danger. The first result of the Wartburg\r\nscandal was that the Duke of Weimar had to curtail the liberties of his\r\nsubjects. Its further effects became only too evident as time went on. It\r\nleft behind it throughout Germany the impression that there were forces of\r\ndisorder at work in the Press and in the Universities which must be crushed\r\nat all cost by the firm hand of Government; and it deepened the anxiety\r\nwith which King Frederick William was already regarding the promises of\r\nliberty which he had made to the Prussian people two years before.\r\n\r\n[Alexander in 1818.]\r\n\r\nTwelve months passed between the Wartburg festival and the beginning of the\r\nConferences at Aix-la-Chapelle. In the interval a more important person\r\nthan the King of Prussia went over to the side of reaction. Up to the\r\nsummer of 1818, the Czar appeared to have abated nothing of his zeal for\r\nconstitutional government. In the spring of that year, he summoned the\r\nPolish Diet; addressed them in a speech so enthusiastic as to alarm not\r\nonly the Court of Vienna but all his own counsellors; and stated in the\r\nclearest possible language his intention of extending the benefits of a\r\nrepresentative system to the whole Russian Empire. [280] At the close of\r\nthe brief session he thanked the Polish Deputies for their boldness in\r\nthrowing out a measure proposed by himself. Alexander's popular rhetoric at\r\nWarsaw might perhaps be not incompatible with a settled purpose to permit\r\nno encroachment on authority either there or elsewhere; but the change in\r\nhis tone was so great when he appeared at Aix-la-Chapelle a few months\r\nafterwards, that some strange and sudden cause has been thought necessary\r\nto explain it. It is said that during the Czar's residence at Moscow, in\r\nJune, 1818, the revelation was made to him of the existence of a mass of\r\nsecret societies in the army, whose aim was the overthrow of his own\r\nGovernment. Alexander's father had died by the hands of murderers: his own\r\ntemperament, sanguine and emotional, would make the effects of such a\r\ndiscovery, in the midst of all his benevolent hopes for Russia, poignant to\r\nthe last degree. It is not inconsistent either with his character or with\r\nearlier events in his personal history that the Czar should have yielded to\r\na single shock of feeling, and have changed in a moment from the liberator\r\nto the despot. But the evidence of what passed in his mind is wanting.\r\nHearsay, conjecture, gossip, abound; [281] the one man who could have told\r\nall has left no word. This only is certain, that from the close of the year\r\n1818, the future, hitherto bright with dreams of peaceful progress, became\r\nin Alexander's view a battle-field between the forces of order and anarchy.\r\nThe task imposed by Providence on himself and other kings was no longer to\r\nspread knowledge and liberty among mankind, but to defend existing\r\nauthority, and even authority that was oppressive and un-Christian, against\r\nthe madness that was known as popular right.\r\n\r\n[Conferences of Aix-la-Chapelle, Oct., 1818.]\r\n\r\n[France evacuated.]\r\n\r\n[Proposed Quintuple Alliance.]\r\n\r\n[Canning.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of September, 1818, the Sovereigns or Ministers of the Great\r\nPowers assembled at Aix-la-Chapelle, and the Conferences began. The first\r\nquestion to be decided was whether the Allied Army might safely be\r\nwithdrawn from France; the second, in what form the concert of Europe\r\nshould hereafter be maintained. On the first question there was no\r\ndisagreement: the evacuation of France was resolved upon and promptly\r\nexecuted. The second question was a more difficult one. Richelieu, on\r\nbehalf of King Louis XVIII., represented that France now stood on the same\r\nfooting as any other European Power, and proposed that the Quadruple\r\nAlliance of 1815 should be converted into a genuine European federation by\r\nadding France to it as a fifth member. The plan had been communicated to\r\nthe English Government, and would probably have received its assent but for\r\nthe strong opposition raised by Canning within the Cabinet. Canning took a\r\ngloomy but a true view of the proposed concert of the Powers. He foresaw\r\nthat it would really amount to a combination of governments against\r\nliberty. Therefore, while recognising the existing engagements of this\r\ncountry, he urged that England ought to join in no combination except that\r\nto which it had already pledged itself, namely, the combination made with\r\nthe definite object of resisting French disturbance. To combine with three\r\nPowers to prevent Napoleon or the Jacobins from again becoming masters of\r\nFrance was a reasonable act of policy: to combine with all the Great Powers\r\nof Europe against nothing in particular was to place the country on the\r\nside of governments against peoples, and to involve England in any\r\nenterprise of repression which the Courts might think fit to undertake.\r\nCanning's warning opened the eyes of his colleagues to the view which was\r\nlikely to be taken of such a general alliance by Parliament and by public\r\nopinion. Lord Castlereagh was forbidden to make this country a party to any\r\nabstract union of Governments. In memorable words the Prime Minister\r\ndescribed the true grounds for the decision: \"We must recollect in the\r\nwhole of this business, and ought to make our Allies feel, that the general\r\nand European discussion of these questions will be in the British\r\nParliament.\" [282] Fear of the rising voice of the nation, no longer forced\r\nby military necessities to sanction every measure of its rulers, compelled\r\nLords Liverpool and Castlereagh to take account of scruples which were not\r\ntheir own. On the same grounds, while the Ministry agreed that Continental\r\ndifficulties which might hereafter arise ought to be settled by a friendly\r\ndiscussion among the Great Powers, it declined to elevate this occasional\r\ndeliberation into a system, and to assent to the periodical meeting of a\r\nCongress. Peace might or might not be promoted by the frequent gatherings\r\nof Sovereigns and statesmen; but a council so formed, if permanent in its\r\nnature, would necessarily extinguish the independence of every minor State,\r\nand hand over the government of all Europe to the Great Courts, if only\r\nthey could agree with one another.\r\n\r\n[Declarations and Secret Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.]\r\n\r\nIt was the refusal of England to enter into a general league that\r\ndetermined the form in which the results of the Conference of 1818 were\r\nembodied. In the first place the Quadruple Alliance against French\r\nrevolution was renewed, and with such seriousness that the military centres\r\nwere fixed, at which, in case of any outbreak, the troops of each of the\r\nGreat Powers should assemble. [283] This Treaty, however, was kept secret,\r\nin order not to add to the difficulties of Richelieu. The published\r\ndocuments breathed another spirit. [284] Without announcing an actual\r\nalliance with King Louis XVIII., the Courts, including England, declared\r\nthat through the restoration of legitimate and constitutional monarchy\r\nFrance had regained its place in the councils of Europe, and that it would\r\nhereafter co-operate in maintaining the general peace. For this end\r\nmeetings of the sovereigns or their ministers might be necessary; such\r\nmeetings would, however, be arranged by the ordinary modes of negotiation,\r\nnor would the affairs of any minor State be discussed by the Great Powers,\r\nexcept at the direct invitation of that State, whose representatives would\r\nthen be admitted to the sittings. In these guarded words the intention of\r\nforming a permanent and organised Court of Control over Europe was\r\ndisclaimed. A manifesto, addressed to the world at large, declared that the\r\nsovereigns of the five great States had no other object in their union than\r\nthe maintenance of peace on the basis of existing treaties. They had formed\r\nno new political combinations; their rule was the observance of\r\ninternational law; their object the prosperity and moral welfare of their\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n[Repressive tone of the Conference.]\r\n\r\n[Metternich and Austrian principles henceforth dominant.]\r\n\r\nThe earnestness with which the statesmen of 1818, while accepting the\r\nconditions laid down by England, persevered in the project of a joint\r\nregulation of European affairs may suggest the question whether the plan\r\nwhich they had at heart would not in truth have operated to the benefit of\r\nmankind. The answer is, that the value of any International Council depends\r\nfirstly on the intelligence which it is likely to possess, and secondly on\r\nthe degree in which it is really representative. Experience proved that the\r\nCongresses which followed 1818 possessed but a limited intelligence, and\r\nthat they represented nothing at all but authority. The meeting at\r\nAix-la-Chapelle was itself the turning-point in the constitutional history\r\nof Europe. Though no open declaration was made against constitutional\r\nforms, every Sovereign and every minister who attended the Conference left\r\nit with the resolution to draw the reins of government tighter. A note of\r\nalarm had been sounded. Conspiracies in Belgium, an attempt on the life of\r\nWellington, rumours of a plot to rescue Napoleon from St. Helena, combined\r\nwith the outcry against the German Universities and the whispered tales\r\nfrom Moscow in filling the minds of statesmen with apprehensions. The\r\nchange which had taken place in Alexander himself was of the most serious\r\nmoment. Up to this time Metternich, the leader of European Conservatism,\r\nhad felt that in the Czar there were sympathies with Liberalism and\r\nenlightenment which made the future of Europe doubtful. [285] To check the\r\ndissolution of existing power, to suppress all tendency to change, was the\r\nhabitual object of Austria, and the Czar was the one person who had seemed\r\nlikely to prevent the principles of Austria from becoming the law of\r\nEurope. Elsewhere Metternich had little to fear in the way of opposition.\r\nHardenberg, broken in health and ill-supported by his King, had ceased to\r\nbe a power. Yielding to the apprehensions of Frederick William, perhaps\r\nwith the hope of dispelling them at some future time, he took his place\r\namong the alarmists of the day, and suffered the German policy of Prussia,\r\nto which so great a future lay open a few years before, to become the mere\r\nreflex of Austrian inaction and repression. [286] England, so long as it\r\nwas represented on the Continent by Castlereagh and Wellington, scarcely\r\ncounted for anything on the side of liberty. The sudden change in Alexander\r\nremoved the one check that stood in Austria's way; and from this time\r\nMetternich exercised an authority in Europe such as few statesmen have ever\r\npossessed. His influence, overborne by that of the Czar during 1814 and\r\n1815, struck root at the Conference of Aix-la-Chapelle, maintained itself\r\nunimpaired during five eventful years, and sank only when the death of Lord\r\nCastlereagh allowed the real voice of England once more to be heard, and\r\nCanning, too late to forbid the work of repression in Italy and in Spain,\r\ninaugurated, after an interval of forced neutrality, that worthier concert\r\nwhich established the independence of Greece.\r\n\r\n[Metternich's advice to Prussia, 1818.]\r\n\r\nIf it is the mark of a clever statesman to know where to press and where to\r\ngive way, Metternich certainly proved himself one in 1818. Before the end\r\nof the Conference he delivered to Hardenberg and to the King of Prussia two\r\npapers containing a complete set of recommendations for the management of\r\nPrussian affairs. The contents of these documents were singular enough: it\r\nis still more singular that they form the history of what actually took\r\nplace in Prussia during the succeeding years. Starting with the assumption\r\nthat the party of revolution had found its lever in the promise of King\r\nFrederick William to create a Representative System, Metternich\r\ndemonstrated in polite language to the very men who had made this promise,\r\nthat any central Representation would inevitably overthrow the Prussian\r\nState; pointed out that the King's dominions consisted of seven Provinces;\r\nand recommended Frederick William to fulfil his promise only by giving to\r\neach Province a Diet for the discussion of its own local concerns. Having\r\nthus warned the King against creating a National Parliament, like that\r\nwhich had thrown France into revolution in 1789, Metternich exhibited the\r\nspecific dangers of the moment and the means of overcoming them. These\r\ndangers were Universities, Gymnastic establishments, and the Press. \"The\r\nrevolutionists,\" he said, \"despairing of effecting their aim themselves,\r\nhave formed the settled plan of educating the next generation for\r\nrevolution. The Gymnastic establishment is a preparatory school for\r\nUniversity disorders. The University seizes the youth as he leaves boyhood,\r\nand gives him a revolutionary training. This mischief is common to all\r\nGermany, and must be checked by joint action of the Governments. Gymnasia,\r\non the contrary, were invented at Berlin, and spring from Berlin. For\r\nthese, palliative measures are no longer sufficient. It has become a duty\r\nof State for the King of Prussia to destroy the evil. The whole institution\r\nin every shape must be closed and uprooted.\" With regard to the abuse of\r\nthe Press, Metternich contented himself with saying that a difference ought\r\nto be made between substantial books and mere pamphlets or journals; and\r\nthat the regulation of the Press throughout Germany at large could only be\r\neffected by an agreement between Austria and Prussia. [287]\r\n\r\n[Stourdza's pamphlet.]\r\n\r\nWith a million men under arms, the Sovereigns who had overthrown Napoleon\r\ntrembled because thirty or forty journalists and professors pitched their\r\nrhetoric rather too high, and because wise heads did not grow upon\r\nschoolboys' shoulders. The Emperor Francis, whose imagination had failed to\r\nrise to the glories of the Holy Alliance, alone seems to have had some\r\nsuspicion of the absurdity of the present alarms. [288] The Czar\r\ndistinguished himself by his zeal against the lecturers who were turning\r\nthe world upside down. As if Metternich had not frightened the Congress\r\nenough already, the Czar distributed at Aix-la-Chapelle a pamphlet\r\npublished by one Stourdza, a Moldavian, which described Germany as on the\r\nbrink of revolution, and enumerated half a score of mortal disorders which\r\nracked that unfortunate country. The chief of all was the vicious system of\r\nthe Universities, which instead of duly developing the vessel of the\r\nChristian State from the cradle of Moses, [289] brought up young men to be\r\ndespisers of law and instruments of a licentious Press. The ingenious\r\nMoldavian, whose expressions in some places bear a singular resemblance to\r\nthose of Alexander, while in others they are actually identical with\r\nreflections of Metternich's not then published, went on to enlighten the\r\nGerman Governments as to the best means of rescuing their subjects from\r\ntheir perilous condition. Certain fiscal and administrative changes were\r\nbriefly suggested, but the main reform urged was exactly that propounded by\r\nMetternich, the enforcement of a better discipline and of a more\r\nrigidly-prescribed course of study at the Universities, along with the\r\nsupervision of all journals and periodical literature.\r\n\r\n[The murder of Kotzebue, March 23, 1819.]\r\n\r\nStourdza's pamphlet, in which loose reasoning was accompanied by the\r\ncoarsest invective, would have gained little attention if it had depended\r\non its own merits or on the reputation of its author: it became a different\r\nmatter when it was known to represent the views of the Czar. A vehement but\r\nnatural outcry arose at the Universities against this interference of the\r\nforeigner with German domestic affairs. National independence, it seemed,\r\nhad been won in the deadly struggle against France only in order that\r\ninternal liberty, the promised fruit of this independence, should be\r\nsacrificed at the bidding of Russia. The Czar himself was out of reach: the\r\nvengeance of outraged patriotism fell upon an insignificant person who had\r\nthe misfortune to be regarded as his principal agent. A dramatic author\r\nthen famous, now forgotten, August Kotzebue, held the office of Russian\r\nagent in Central Germany, and conducted a newspaper whose object was to\r\nthrow ridicule on the national movement of the day, and especially on those\r\nassociations of students where German enthusiasm reached its climax. Many\r\ncircumstances embittered popular feeling against this man, and caused him\r\nto be regarded less as a legitimate enemy than as a traitor and an\r\napostate. Kotzebue had himself been a student at Jena, and at one time had\r\nturned liberal sentiments to practical account in his plays. Literary\r\njealousies and wounded vanity had subsequently alienated him from his\r\ncountry, and made him the willing and acrid hireling of a foreign Court.\r\nThe reports which, as Russian agent, he sent to St. Petersburg were\r\ndoubtless as offensive as the attacks on the Universities which he\r\npublished in his journal; but it was an extravagant compliment to the man\r\nto imagine that he was the real author of the Czar's desertion from\r\nLiberalism to reaction. This, however, was the common belief, and it cost\r\nKotzebue dear. A student from Erlangen, Carl Sand, who had accompanied the\r\nstandard at the Wartburg festival, formed the silent resolve of sacrificing\r\nhis own life in order to punish the enemy of his country. Sand was a man of\r\npure and devout, though ill-balanced character. His earlier life marked him\r\nas one whose whole being was absorbed by what he considered a divine call.\r\nHe thought of the Greeks who, even in their fallen estate, had so often\r\ndied to free their country from Turkish oppression, and formed the\r\ndeplorable conclusion that by murdering a decayed dramatist he could strike\r\nsome great blow against the powers of evil. [290] He sought the unfortunate\r\nKotzebue in the midst of his family, stabbed him to the heart, and then\r\nturned his weapon against himself. Recovering from his wounds, he was\r\ncondemned to death, and perished, after a year's interval, on the scaffold,\r\ncalling God to witness that he died for Germany to be free.\r\n\r\n[Action of Metternich.]\r\n\r\nThe effects of Sand's act were very great, and their real nature was at\r\nonce recognised. Hardenberg, the moment that he heard of Kotzebue's death,\r\nexclaimed that a Prussian Constitution had now become impossible.\r\nMetternich, who had thought the Czar mad because he desired to found a\r\npeaceful alliance of Sovereigns on religious principles, was not likely to\r\nmake allowance for a kind of piety that sent young rebels over the country\r\non missions of murder. The Austrian statesman was in Rome when the news of\r\nKotzebue's assassination reached him. He saw that the time had come for\r\nunited action throughout Germany, and, without making any public utterance,\r\ndrew up a scheme of repressive measures, and sent out proposals for a\r\ngathering of the Ministers of all the principal German Courts. In the\r\nsummer he travelled slowly northwards, met the King of Prussia at Teplitz,\r\nin Bohemia, and shortly afterwards opened the intended Conference of\r\nMinisters in the neighbouring town of Carlsbad. A number of innocent\r\npersons had already, at his instigation, been arrested in Prussia and other\r\nStates, under circumstances deeply discreditable to Government. Private\r\npapers were seized, and garbled extracts from them published in official\r\nprints as proof of guilt. [291] \"By the help of God,\" Metternich wrote, \"I\r\nhope to defeat the German Revolution, just as I vanquished the conqueror of\r\nthe world. The revolutionists thought me far away, because I was five\r\nhundred leagues off. They deceived themselves; I have been in the midst of\r\nthem, and now I am striking my blows.\" [292] Metternich's plan was to\r\nenforce throughout Germany, by means of legislation in the Federal Diet,\r\nthe principle which he had already privately commended to the King of\r\nPrussia. There were two distinct objects of policy before him: the first,\r\nto prevent the formation in any German State of an assembly representing\r\nthe whole community, like the English House of Commons or the French\r\nChamber of Deputies; the second, to establish a general system of\r\ncensorship over the Press and over the Universities, and to create a\r\ncentral authority, vested, as the representative of the Diet, with\r\ninquisitorial powers.\r\n\r\n[The South-Western States become constitutional as Prussia relapses.]\r\n\r\n[Bavarian Constitution, May 26, 1818.]\r\n\r\nThe first of these objects, the prevention of general assemblies, had been\r\nrendered more difficult by recent acts of the Governments of Bavaria and\r\nBaden. A singular change had taken place in the relation between Prussia\r\nand the Minor States which had formerly constituted the Federation of the\r\nRhine. When, at the Congress of Vienna, Prussian statesmen had endeavoured\r\nto limit the arbitrary rule of petty sovereigns by charging the Diet with\r\nthe protection of constitutional right over all Germany, the Kings of\r\nBavaria and Würtemberg had stoutly refused to part with sovereign power. To\r\nsubmit to a law of liberty, as it then seemed, was to lose their own\r\nseparate existence, and to reduce themselves to dependence upon the\r\nJacobins of Berlin. This apprehension governed the policy of the Minor\r\nCourts from 1813 to 1815. But since that time events had taken an\r\nunexpected turn. Prussia, which once threatened to excite popular movement\r\nover all Germany in its own interest, had now accepted Metternich's\r\nguidance, and made its representative in the Diet the mouthpiece of\r\nAustrian interest and policy. It was no longer from Berlin but from Vienna\r\nthat the separate existence of the Minor States was threatened. The two\r\ngreat Courts were uniting against the independence of their weaker\r\nneighbours. The danger of any popular invasion of kingly rights in the name\r\nof German unity had passed away, and the safety of the lesser sovereigns\r\nseemed now to lie not in resisting the spirit of constitutional reform but\r\nin appealing to it. In proportion as Prussia abandoned itself to\r\nMetternich's direction, the Governments of the South-Western States\r\nfamiliarised themselves with the idea of a popular representation; and at\r\nthe very time when the conservative programme was being drawn up for the\r\nCongress of Aix-la-Chapelle, the King of Bavaria published a Constitution.\r\nBaden followed after a short interval, and in each of these States,\r\nalthough the Legislature was divided into two Chambers, the representation\r\nestablished was not merely provincial, according to Metternich's plan, or\r\nwholly on the principle of separate Estates or Orders, as before the\r\nRevolution, but to some extent on the type of England and France, where the\r\nLower Chamber, in theory, represented the public at large. This was enough\r\nto make Metternich condemn the new Constitutions as radically bad and\r\nrevolutionary. [293] He was, however, conscious of the difficulty of making\r\na direct attack upon them. This task he reserved for a later time. His\r\npolicy at present was to obtain a declaration from the Diet which should\r\nprevent any other Government within the League from following in the same\r\npath; while, by means of Press-laws, supervision of the Universities, and a\r\ncentral commission of inquiry, he expected to make the position of\r\nrebellious professors and agitators so desperate that the forces of\r\ndisorder, themselves not deeply rooted in German nature, would presently\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\n[Conference of Carlsbad, Aug., 1819.]\r\n\r\nThe Conference of Ministers at Carlsbad, which in the memory of the German\r\npeople is justly associated with the suppression of their liberty for an\r\nentire generation, began and ended in the month of August, 1819. Though\r\nattended by the representatives of eight German Governments, it did little\r\nmore than register the conclusions which Metternich had already formed.\r\n[294] The zeal with which the envoy of Prussia supported every repressive\r\nmeasure made it useless for the Ministers of the Minor Courts to offer an\r\nopen opposition. Nothing more was required than that the Diet should\r\nformally sanction the propositions thus privately accepted by all the\r\nleading Ministers. On the 20th of September this sanction was given. The\r\nDiet, which had sat for three years without framing a single useful law,\r\nratified all Metternich's oppressive enactments in as many hours. It was\r\nordered that in every State within the Federation the Government should\r\ntake measures for preventing the publication of any journal or pamphlet\r\nexcept after licence given, and each Government was declared responsible to\r\nthe Federation at large for any objectionable writing published within its\r\nown territory. The Sovereigns were required to appoint civil commissioners\r\nat the Universities, whose duty it should be to enforce public order and to\r\ngive a salutary direction to the teaching of the professors. They were also\r\nrequired to dismiss all professors who should overstep the bounds of their\r\nduty, and such dismissed persons were prohibited from being employed in any\r\nother State. It was enacted that within fifteen days of the passing of the\r\ndecree an extraordinary Commission should assemble at Mainz to investigate\r\nthe origin and extent of the secret revolutionary societies which\r\nthreatened the safety of the Federation. The Commission was empowered to\r\nexamine and, if necessary, to arrest any subject of any German State. All\r\nlaw-courts and other authorities were required to furnish it with\r\ninformation and with documents, and to undertake all inquiries which the\r\nCommission might order. The Commission, however, was not a law-court\r\nitself: its duty was to report to the Diet, which would then create such\r\njudicial machinery as might be necessary. [295]\r\n\r\n[Supplementary Act of Vienna, June, 1820.]\r\n\r\nThese measures were of an exceptional, and purported to be of a temporary,\r\ncharacter. There were, however, other articles which Metternich intended to\r\nraise to the rank of organic laws, and to incorporate with the Act of 1815,\r\nwhich formed the basis of the German Federation. The conferences of\r\nMinisters were accordingly resumed after a short interval, but at Vienna\r\ninstead of at Carlsbad. They lasted for several months, a stronger\r\nopposition being now made by the Minor States than before. A second body of\r\nfederal law was at length drawn up, and accepted by the Diet on the 8th of\r\nJune, 1820. [296] The most important of its provisions was that which\r\nrelated to the Constitutions admissible within the German League. It was\r\ndeclared that in every State, with the exception of the four free cities,\r\nsupreme power resided in the Sovereign and in him alone, and that no\r\nConstitution might do more than bind the Sovereign to co-operate with the\r\nEstates in certain definite acts of government. [297]\r\n\r\nIn cases where a Government either appealed for help against rebellious\r\nsubjects, or was notoriously unable to exert authority, the Diet charged\r\nitself with the duty of maintaining public order.\r\n\r\n[The reaction in Prussia.]\r\n\r\nFrom this time whatever liberty existed in Germany was to be found in the\r\nMinor States, in Bavaria and Baden, and in Würtemberg, which received a\r\nConstitution a few days before the enrolment of the decrees of Carlsbad. In\r\nPrussia the reaction carried everything before it. Humboldt, the best and\r\nmost liberal of the Ministers, resigned, protesting in vain against the\r\nignominious part which the King had determined to play. He was followed by\r\nthose of his colleagues whose principles were dearer to them than their\r\nplaces. Hardenberg remained in office, a dying man, isolated, neglected,\r\nthwarted; clinging to some last hope of redeeming his promises to the\r\nPrussian people, yet jealous of all who could have given him true aid;\r\ndishonouring by tenacity of place a career associated with so much of his\r\ncountry's glory, and ennobled in earlier days by so much fortitude in time\r\nof evil. There gathered around the King a body of men who could see in the\r\ngreat patriotic efforts and reforms of the last decade nothing but an\r\nencroachment of demagogues on the rights of power. They were willing that\r\nPrussia should receive its orders from Metternich and serve a foreign Court\r\nin the work of repression, rather than that it should take its place at the\r\nhead of all Germany on the condition of becoming a free and constitutional\r\nState. [298] The stigma of disloyalty was attached to all who had kindled\r\npopular enthusiasm in 1808 and 1812. To have served the nation was to have\r\nsinned against the Government. Stein was protected by his great name from\r\nattack, but not from calumny. His friend Arndt, whose songs and addresses\r\nhad so powerfully moved the heart of Germany during the War of Liberation,\r\nwas subjected to repeated legal process, and, although unconvicted of any\r\noffence, was suspended from the exercise of his professorship for twenty\r\nyears. Other persons, whose fault at the most was to have worked for German\r\nunity, were brought before special tribunals, and after long trial either\r\nrefused a public acquittal or sentenced to actual imprisonment. Free\r\nteaching, free discussion, ceased. The barrier of authority closed every\r\navenue of political thought. Everywhere the agent of the State prescribed\r\nan orthodox opinion, and took note of those who raised a dissentient voice.\r\n\r\n[The Commission at Mainz.]\r\n\r\nThe pretext made at Carlsbad for this crusade against liberty, which was\r\nmore energetically carried out in Prussia than elsewhere, was the existence\r\nof a conspiracy or agitation for the overthrow of Governments and of the\r\npresent constitution of the German League. It was stated that proofs\r\nexisted of the intention to establish by force a Republic one and\r\nindivisible, like that of France in 1793. But the very Commission which was\r\ninstituted by the Carlsbad Ministers to investigate the origin and nature\r\nof this conspiracy disproved its existence. The Commission assembled at\r\nMainz, examined several hundred persons and many thousand documents, and\r\nafter two years' labour delivered a report to the Diet. The report went\r\nback to the time of Fichte's lectures and the formation of the Tugendbund\r\nin 1808, traced the progress of all the students' associations and other\r\npatriotic societies from that time to 1820; and, while exhibiting in the\r\nworst possible light the aims and conduct of the advocates of German unity,\r\nacknowledged that scarcely a single proof had been discovered of\r\ntreasonable practice, and that the loyalty of the mass of the people was\r\nitself a sufficient guarantee against the impulses of the evil-minded.\r\n[299] Such was the impression of triviality and imposture produced at the\r\nDiet by this report, that the representatives of several States proposed\r\nthat the Commission should forthwith be dissolved as useless and\r\nunnecessary. This, however, could not be tolerated by Metternich and his\r\nnew disciples. The Commission was allowed to continue in existence, and\r\nwith it the regime of silence and repression. The measures which had been\r\naccepted at Carlsbad as temporary and provisional became more and more a\r\npart of the habitual system of government. Prosecutions succeeded one\r\nanother; letters were opened; spies attended the lectures of professors and\r\nthe meetings of students; the newspapers were everywhere prohibited from\r\ndiscussing German affairs. In a country where there were so many printers\r\nand so many readers journalism could not altogether expire. It was still\r\npermissible to give the news and to offer an opinion about foreign lands:\r\nand for years to come the Germans, like beggars regaling themselves with\r\nthe scents from rich men's kitchens, [300] followed every stage of the\r\npolitical struggles that were agitating France, England, and Spain, while\r\nthey were not allowed to express a desire or to formulate a grievance of\r\ntheir own.\r\n\r\n[Prussian Provincial Estates, June, 1823.]\r\n\r\n[Redeeming features of Prussian absolutism.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1822 Hardenberg died. All hope of a fulfilment of the promises\r\nmade in Prussia in 1815 had already become extinct. Not many months after\r\nthe Minister's death, King Frederick William established the Provincial\r\nEstates which had been recommended to him by Metternich, and announced that\r\nthe creation of a central representative system would be postponed until\r\nsuch time as the King should think fit to introduce it. This meant that the\r\nproject was finally abandoned; and Prussia in consequence remained without\r\na Parliament until the Revolution of 1848 was at the door. The Provincial\r\nEstates, with which the King affected to temper absolute rule, met only\r\nonce in three years. Their function was to express an opinion upon local\r\nmatters when consulted by the Government: their enemies said that they were\r\naristocratic and did harm, their partizans could not pretend that they did\r\nmuch good. In the bitterness of spirit with which, at a later time, the\r\nfriends of liberty denounced the betrayal of the cause of freedom by the\r\nPrussian Court, a darker colour has perhaps been introduced into the\r\nhistory of this period than really belongs to it. The wrongs sustained by\r\nthe Prussian nation have been compared to those inflicted by the despotism\r\nof Spain. But, however contemptible the timidity of King Frederick William,\r\nhowever odious the ingratitude shown to the truest friends of King and\r\npeople, the Government of 1819 is not correctly represented in such a\r\nparallel. To identify the thousand varieties of wrong under the common name\r\nof oppression, is to mistake words for things, and to miss the\r\ncharacteristic features which distinguish nations from one another. The\r\ngreatest evils which a Government can inflict upon its subjects are\r\nprobably religious persecution, wasteful taxation, and the denial of\r\njustice in the daily affairs of life. None of these were present in Prussia\r\nduring the darkest days of reaction. The hand of oppression fell heavily on\r\nsome of the best and some of the most enlightened men; it violated\r\ninterests so precious as those of free criticism and free discussion of\r\npublic affairs; but the great mass of the action of Government was never on\r\nthe side of evil. The ordinary course of justice was still pure, the\r\nadministration conscientious and thrifty. The system of popular education,\r\nwhich for the first time placed Prussia in advance of Saxony and other\r\nGerman States, dates from these years of warfare against liberty. A\r\nreactionary despotism built the schools and framed the laws whose\r\nreproduction in free England half a century later is justly regarded as the\r\nchief of all the liberal measures of our day. So strong, so lasting, was\r\nthat vital tradition which made monarchy in Prussia an instrument for the\r\nexecution of great public ends.\r\n\r\n[A new Liberalism grows up in Germany after 1820.]\r\n\r\n[Interest in France.]\r\n\r\nBut the old harmony between rulers and subjects in Germany perished in\r\nthe system of coercion which Metternich established in 1819. Patient as\r\nthe Germans were, loyal as they had proved themselves to Frederick William\r\nand to worse princes through good and evil, the galling disappointment of\r\nnoble hopes, the silencing of the Press, the dissolution of societies,--\r\ncalumnies, expulsions, prosecutions,--embittered many an honest mind\r\nagainst authority. The Commission of Mainz did not find conspirators, but\r\nit made them. As years went by, and all the means of legitimately working\r\nfor the improvement of German public life were one after another\r\nextinguished, men of ardent character thought of more violent methods.\r\nSecret societies, such as Metternich had imagined, came into actual being.\r\n[301] And among those who neither sank into apathy and despair nor enrolled\r\nthemselves against existing power, a new body of ideas supplanted the old\r\nloyal belief in the regeneration of Germany by its princes. The\r\nParliamentary struggles of France, the revolutionary movements in Italy and\r\nin Spain which began at this epoch, drew the imagination away from that\r\npictured restoration of a free Teutonic past which had proved so barren of\r\nresult, and set in its place the idea of a modern universal or European\r\nLiberalism. The hatred against France, especially among the younger men,\r\ndisappeared. A distinction was made between the tyrant Napoleon and the\r\npeople who were now giving to the rest of the Continent the example of a\r\nfree and animated public life, and illuminating the age with a political\r\nliterature so systematic and so ingenious that it seemed almost like a\r\npolitical philosophy. The debates in the French Assembly, the writings of\r\nFrench publicists, became the school of the Germans. Paris regained in\r\nforeign eyes something of the interest that it had possessed in 1789. Each\r\nvictory or defeat of the French popular cause awoke the joy or the sorrow\r\nof German Liberals, to whom all was blank at home: and when at length the\r\nthrone of the Bourbons fell, the signal for deliverance seemed to have\r\nsounded in many a city beyond the Rhine.\r\n\r\n[France after 1818.]\r\n\r\n[Richelieu resigns, Dec., 1818. Decazes keeps power.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in Central Europe the balance between liberty and\r\nreaction, wavering in 1815, definitely fell to the side of reaction at the\r\nCongress of Aix-la-Chapelle. It remains to trace the course of events which\r\nin France itself suspended the peaceful progress of the nation, and threw\r\npower for some years into the hands of a faction which belonged to the\r\npast. The measures carried by Decazes in 1817, which gave so much\r\nsatisfaction to the French, were by no means viewed with the same approval\r\neither at London or at Vienna. The two principal of these were the\r\nElectoral Law, and a plan of military reorganisation which brought back\r\ngreat numbers of Napoleon's old officers and soldiers to the army.\r\nRichelieu, though responsible as the head of the Ministry, felt very grave\r\nfears as to the results of this legislation. He had already become anxious\r\nand distressed when the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle met; and the events\r\nwhich took place in France during his absence, as well as the\r\ncommunications which passed between himself and the foreign Ministers,\r\nconvinced him that a change of internal policy was necessary. The busy mind\r\nof Metternich had already been scheming against French Liberalism. Alarmed\r\nat the energy shown by Decazes, the Austrian statesman had formed the\r\ndesign of reconciling Artois and the Ultra-Royalists to the King's\r\nGovernment; and he now urged Richelieu, if his old opponents could be\r\nbrought to reason, to place himself at the head of a coalition of all the\r\nconservative elements in the State. [302] While the Congress of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle was sitting, the partial elections for the year 1818, the\r\nsecond under the new Electoral Law, took place. Among the deputies returned\r\nthere were some who passed for determined enemies of the Bourbon\r\nrestoration, especially Lafayette, whose name was so closely associated\r\nwith the humiliations of the Court in 1789. Richelieu received the news\r\nwith dismay, and on his return to Paris took steps which ended in the\r\ndismissal of Decazes, and the offer of a seat in the Cabinet to Villèle,\r\nthe Ultra-Royalist leader. But the attempted combination failed. Richelieu\r\naccordingly withdrew from office; and a new Ministry was formed, of which\r\nDecazes, who had proved himself more powerful than his assailants, was the\r\nreal though not the nominal chief.\r\n\r\n[Election of Grégoire, Sept., 1819.]\r\n\r\nThe victory of the young and popular statesman was seen with extreme\r\ndispleasure by all the foreign Courts, nor was his success an enduring one.\r\nFor awhile the current of Liberal opinion in France and the favour of King\r\nLouis XVIII. enabled Decazes to hold his own against the combinations of\r\nhis opponents and the ill-will of all the most powerful men in Europe. An\r\nattack made on the Electoral Law by the Upper House was defeated by the\r\ncreation of sixty new Peers, among whom there were several who had been\r\nexpelled in 1815. But the forces of Liberalism soon passed beyond the\r\nMinister's own control, and his steady dependence upon Louis XVIII. now\r\nraised against him as resolute an opposition among the enemies of the House\r\nof Bourbon as among the Ultra-Royalists. In the elections of 1819 the\r\ncandidates of the Ministry were beaten by men of more pronounced opinions.\r\nAmong the new members there was one whose victory caused great astonishment\r\nand alarm. The ex-bishop Grégoire, one of the authors of the destruction of\r\nthe old French Church in 1790, and mover of the resolution which\r\nestablished the Republic in 1792, was brought forward from his retirement\r\nand elected Deputy by the town of Grenoble. To understand the panic caused\r\nby this election we must recall, not the events of the Revolution, but the\r\nlegends of them which were current in 1819. The history of Grégoire by no\r\nmeans justifies the outcry which was raised against him; his real actions,\r\nhowever, formed the smallest part of the things that were alleged or\r\nbelieved by his enemies. It was said he had applauded the execution of King\r\nLouis XVI., when he had in fact protested against it: [303] his courageous\r\nadherence to the character of a Christian priest throughout the worst days\r\nof the Convention, his labours in organising the Constitutional Church when\r\nthe choice lay between that and national atheism, were nothing, or worse\r\nthan nothing, in the eyes of men who felt themselves to be the despoiled\r\nheirs of that rich and aristocratic landed society, called the Feudal\r\nChurch, which Grégoire had been so active in breaking up. Unluckily for\r\nhimself, Grégoire, though humane in action, had not abstained from the\r\nrhodomontades against kings in general which were the fashion in 1793.\r\nLouis XVIII., forgetting that he had himself lately made the regicide\r\nFouché a Minister, interpreted Grégoire's election by the people of\r\nGrenoble, to which the Ultra-Royalists had cunningly contributed, as a\r\nthreat against the Bourbon family. He showed the displeasure usual with him\r\nwhen any slight was offered to his personal dignity, and drew nearer to his\r\nbrother Artois and the Ultra-Royalists, whom he had hitherto shunned as his\r\nfavourite Minister's worst enemies. Decazes, true to his character as the\r\nKing's friend, now confessed that he had gone too far in the legislation of\r\n1817, and that the Electoral Law, under which such a monster as Grégoire\r\ncould gain a seat, required to be altered. A project of law was sketched,\r\ndesigned to restore the preponderance in the constituencies to the landed\r\naristocracy. Grégoire's election was itself invalidated; and the Ministers\r\nwho refused to follow Decazes in his new policy of compromise were\r\ndismissed from their posts.\r\n\r\n[Murder of the Duke of Berry, Feb. 13, 1820.]\r\n\r\n[Reaction sets in.]\r\n\r\n[Fall of Decazes. Richelieu Minister, Feb., 1820.]\r\n\r\nA few months more passed, and an event occurred which might have driven a\r\nstronger Government than that of Louis XVIII. into excesses of reaction.\r\nThe heirs to the Crown next in succession to the Count of Artois were his\r\ntwo sons, the Dukes of Angoulême and Berry. Angoulême was childless; the\r\nDuke of Berry was the sole hope of the elder Bourbon line, which, if he\r\nshould die without a son, would, as a reigning house, become extinct, the\r\nCrown of France not descending to a female. [304] The circumstance which\r\nmade Berry's life so dear to Royalists made his destruction the\r\nall-absorbing purpose of an obscure fanatic, who abhorred the Bourbon\r\nfamily as the lasting symbol of the foreigner's victory over France.\r\nLouvel, a working man, had followed Napoleon to exile in Elba. After\r\nreturning to his country he had dogged the footsteps of the Bourbon princes\r\nfor years together, waiting for the chance of murder. On the night of the\r\n13th of February, 1820, he seized the Duke of Berry as he was leaving the\r\nOpera House, and plunged a knife into his breast. The Duke lingered for\r\nsome hours, and expired early the next morning in the presence of King\r\nLouis XVIII., the Princes, and all the Ministers. Terrible as the act was,\r\nit was the act of a single resolute mind: no human being had known of\r\nLouvel's intention. But it was impossible that political passion should\r\nawait the quiet investigation of a law-court. No murder ever produced a\r\nstronger outburst of indignation among the governing classes, or was more\r\nskilfully turned to the advantage of party. The Liberals felt that their\r\ncause was lost. While fanatical Ultra-Royalists, abandoning themselves to a\r\ncredulity worthy of the Reign of Terror, accused Decazes himself of\r\ncomplicity with the assassin, their leaders fixed upon the policy which was\r\nto be imposed on the King. It was in vain that Decazes brought forward his\r\nreactionary Electoral Law, and proposed to invest the officers of State\r\nwith arbitrary powers of arrest and to re-establish the censorship of the\r\nPress. The Count of Artois insisted upon the dismissal of the Minister, as\r\nthe only consolation which could be given to him for the murder of his son\r\nThe King yielded; and, as an Ultra-Royalist administration was not yet\r\npossible, Richelieu unwillingly returned to office, assured by Artois that\r\nhis friends had no other desire than to support his own firm and temperate\r\nrule.\r\n\r\n[Progress of the reaction in France.]\r\n\r\n[Ultra-Royalist Ministry, Dec., 1821.]\r\n\r\n[The Congregation.]\r\n\r\nReturning to power under such circumstances, Richelieu became, in spite of\r\nhimself, the Minister of reaction. The Press was fettered, the legal\r\nsafeguards of personal liberty were suspended, the electoral system was\r\ntransformed by a measure which gave a double vote to men of large property.\r\nSo violent were the passions which this retrograde march of Government\r\nexcited, that for a moment Paris seemed to be on the verge of revolution.\r\nTumultuous scenes occurred in the streets; but the troops, on whom\r\neverything depended, obeyed the orders given to them, and the danger passed\r\naway. The first elections under the new system reduced the Liberal party to\r\nimpotence, and brought back to the Chamber a number of men who had sat in\r\nthe reactionary Parliament of 1816. Villèle and other Ultra-Royalists were\r\ninvited to join Richelieu's Cabinet. For awhile it seemed as if the\r\npassions of Church and aristocracy might submit to the curb of a practical\r\nstatesmanship, friendly, if not devoted, to their own interests. But\r\nrestraint was soon cast aside. The Count of Artois saw the road to power\r\nopen, and broke his promise of supporting the Minister who had taken office\r\nat his request. Censured and thwarted in the Chamber of Deputies, Richelieu\r\nconfessed that he had undertaken a hopeless task, and bade farewell to\r\npublic life. King Louis, now nearing the grave, could struggle no longer\r\nagainst the brother who was waiting to ascend his throne. The next Ministry\r\nwas nominated not by the King but by Artois. Around Villèle, the real head\r\nof the Cabinet, there was placed a body of men who represented not the new\r\nFrance, or even that small portion of it which was called to exercise the\r\nactive rights of citizenship, but the social principles of a past age, and\r\nthat Catholic or Ultramontane revival which was now freshening the surface\r\nbut not stirring the depths of the great mass of French religious\r\nindifference. A religious society known as the Congregation, which had\r\nstruck its first roots under the storm of Republican persecution, and grown\r\nup during the Empire, a solitary yet unobserved rallying-place for Catholic\r\nopponents of Napoleon's despotism, now expanded into a great organism of\r\ngovernment. The highest in blood and in office sought membership in it: its\r\npatronage raised ambitious men to the stations they desired, its hostility\r\nmade itself felt against the small as well as against the great. The spirit\r\nwhich now gained the ascendancy in French government was clerical even more\r\nthan it was aristocratic. It was monarchical too, but rather from dislike\r\nto the secularist tone of Liberalism and from trust in the orthodoxy of the\r\nCount of Artois than from any fixed belief in absolutist principles. There\r\nmight be good reason to oppose King Louis XVIII.; but what priest, what\r\nnoble, could doubt the divine right of a prince who was ready to compensate\r\nthe impoverished emigrants out of the public funds, and to commit the whole\r\nsystem of public education to the hands of the clergy?\r\n\r\n[Bourbon rule before and after 1821.]\r\n\r\nIn the middle class of France, which from this time began to feel itself in\r\nopposition to the Bourbon Government, there had been no moral change\r\ncorresponding to that which made so great a difference between the\r\ngoverning authority of 1819 and that of 1822. Public opinion, though\r\nstrongly affected, was not converted into something permanently unlike\r\nitself by the murder of the Duke of Berry. The courtiers, the devotees, the\r\ngreat ladies, who had laid a bold hand upon power, had not the nation on\r\ntheir side, although for a while the nation bore their sway submissively.\r\nBut the fate of the Bourbon monarchy was in fact decided when Artois and\r\nhis confidants became its representatives. France might have forgotten that\r\nthe Bourbons owed their throne to foreign victories; it could not be\r\ngoverned in perpetuity by what was called the _Parti Prêtre_. Twenty\r\nyears taken from the burden of age borne by Louis XVIII., twenty years of\r\npower given to Decazes, might have prolonged the rule of the restored\r\nfamily perhaps for some generations. If military pride found small\r\nsatisfaction in the contrast between the Napoleonic age and that which\r\nimmediately succeeded it, there were enough parents who valued the blood of\r\ntheir children, there were enough speakers and writers who valued the\r\nliberty of discussion, enough capitalists who valued quiet times, for the\r\nnew order to be recognised as no unhopeful one. France has indeed seldom\r\nhad a better government than it possessed between 1816 and 1820, nor could\r\nan equal period be readily named during which the French nation, as a\r\nwhole, enjoyed greater happiness.\r\n\r\n[General causes of the victory of reaction in Europe.]\r\n\r\nPolitical reaction had reached its full tide in Europe generally about five\r\nyears after the end of the great war. The phenomena were by no means the\r\nsame in all countries, nor were the accidents of personal influence without\r\na large share in the determination of events: yet, underlying all\r\ndifferences, we may trace the operation of certain great causes which were\r\nnot limited by the boundaries of individual States. The classes in which\r\nany fixed belief in constitutional government existed were nowhere very\r\nlarge; outside the circle of state officials there was scarcely any one who\r\nhad had experience in the conduct of public affairs. In some countries, as\r\nin Russia and Prussia, the conception of progress towards self-government\r\nhad belonged in the first instance to the holders of power: it had\r\nexercised the imagination of a Czar, or appealed to the understanding of a\r\nPrussian Minister, eager, in the extremity of ruin, to develop every\r\nelement of worth and manliness existing within his nation. The cooling of a\r\nwarm fancy, the disappearance of external dangers, the very agitation which\r\narose when the idea of liberty passed from the rulers to their subjects,\r\nsufficed to check the course of reform. And by the side of the Kings and\r\nMinisters who for a moment had attached themselves to constitutional\r\ntheories there stood the old privileged orders, or what remained of them,\r\nthe true party of reaction, eager to fan the first misgivings and alarms of\r\nSovereigns, and to arrest a development more prejudicial to their own power\r\nand importance than to the dignity and security of the Crown. Further,\r\nthere existed throughout Europe the fatal and ineradicable tradition of the\r\nconvulsions of the first Revolution, and of the horrors of 1793. No votary\r\nof absolutism, no halting and disquieted friend of freedom, could ever be\r\nat a loss for images of woe in presaging the results of popular\r\nsovereignty; and the action of one or two infatuated assassins owed its\r\nwide influence on Europe chiefly to the ancient name and memory of\r\nJacobinism.\r\n\r\nThere was also in the very fact that Europe had been restored to peace by\r\nthe united efforts of all the governments something adverse to the success\r\nof a constitutional or a Liberal party in any State. Constitutional systems\r\nhad indeed been much praised at the Congress of Vienna; but the group of\r\nmen who actually controlled Europe in 1815, and who during the five\r\nsucceeding years continued in correspondence and in close personal\r\nintercourse with one another, had, with one exception, passed their lives\r\nin the atmosphere of absolute government, and learnt to regard the conduct\r\nof all great affairs as the business of a small number of very eminent\r\nindividuals. Castlereagh, the one Minister of a constitutional State,\r\nbelonged to a party which, to a degree almost unequalled in Europe,\r\nidentified political duty with the principle of hostility to change. It is\r\nindeed in the correspondence of the English Minister himself, and in\r\nrelation to subjects of purely domestic government in England, that the\r\ncommunity of thought which now existed between all the leading statesmen of\r\nEurope finds its most singular exhibition. Both Metternich and Hardenberg\r\ntook as much interest in the suppression of Lancashire Radicalism, and in\r\nthe measures of coercion which the British Government thought it necessary\r\nto pass in the year 1819, as in the chastisement of rebellious pamphleteers\r\nupon the Rhine, and in the dissolution of the students' clubs at Jena. It\r\nwas indeed no very great matter for the English people, who were now close\r\nupon an era of reform, that Castlereagh received the congratulations of\r\nVienna and Berlin for suspending the Habeas Corpus Act and the right of\r\npublic meeting, [305] or that Metternich believed that no one but himself\r\nknew the real import of the shouts with which the London mob greeted Sir\r\nFrancis Burdett. [306] Neither the impending reform of the English Criminal\r\nLaw nor the emancipation of Irish Catholics resulted from the enlightenment\r\nof foreign Courts, or could be hindered by their indifference. But on the\r\nContinent of Europe the progress towards constitutional freedom was indeed\r\nlikely to be a slow and a chequered one when the Ministers of absolutism\r\nformed so close and intimate a band, when the nations contained within them\r\nsuch small bodies of men in any degree versed in public affairs, and when\r\nthe institutions on which it was proposed to base the liberty of the future\r\nwere so destitute of that strength which springs from connection with the\r\npast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nMovements in the Mediterranean States beginning in 1820--Spain from 1814 to\r\n1820--The South American Colonies--The Army at Cadiz: Action of Quiroga\r\nand Riego--Movement at Corunna--Ferdinand accepts the Constitution of\r\n1812--Naples from 1815 to 1820--The Court-party, the Muratists, the\r\nCarbonari--The Spanish Constitution proclaimed at Naples--Constitutional\r\nmovement in Portugal--Alexander's proposal with regard to Spain--The\r\nConference and Declaration of Troppau--Protest of England--Conference of\r\nLaibach--The Austrians invade Naples and restore absolute Monarchy--\r\nInsurrection in Piedmont, which fails--Spain from 1820 to 1822--Death of\r\nCastlereagh--The Congress of Verona--Policy of England--The French invade\r\nSpain--Restoration of absolute Monarchy, and violence of the reaction--\r\nEngland prohibits the conquest of the Spanish Colonies by France, and\r\nsubsequently recognises their independence--Affairs in Portugal--Canning\r\nsends troops to Lisbon--The Policy of Canning--Estimate of his place in the\r\nhistory of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The Mediterranean movements, beginning in 1820.]\r\n\r\nWhen the guardians of Europe, at the end of the first three years of peace,\r\nscanned from their council-chamber at Aix-la-Chapelle that goodly heritage\r\nwhich, under Providence, their own parental care was henceforth to guard\r\nagainst the assaults of malice and revolution, they had fixed their gaze\r\nchiefly on France, Germany, and the Netherlands, as the regions most\r\nthreatened by the spirit of change. The forecast was not an accurate one.\r\nIn each of these countries Government proved during the succeeding years to\r\nbe much more than a match for its real or imaginary foes: it was in the\r\nMediterranean States, which had excited comparatively little anxiety, that\r\nthe first successful attack was made upon established power. Three\r\nmovements arose successively in the three southern peninsulas, at the time\r\nwhen Metternich was enjoying the silence which he had imposed upon Germany,\r\nand the Ultra-Royalists of France were making good the advantage which the\r\ncrime of an individual and the imprudence of a party had thrown into their\r\nhands. In Spain and in Italy a body of soldiers rose on behalf of\r\nconstitutional government: in Greece a nation rose against the rule of the\r\nforeigner. In all three countries the issue of these movements was, after a\r\nlonger or shorter interval, determined by the Northern Powers. All three\r\nmovements were at first treated as identical in their character, and all\r\nalike condemned as the work of Jacobinism. But the course of events, and a\r\nchange of persons in the government of one great State, brought about a\r\ntruer view of the nature of the struggle in Greece. The ultimate action of\r\nEurope in the affairs of that country was different from its action in the\r\naffairs of Italy and Spain. It is now only remembered as an instance of\r\npolitical recklessness or stupidity that a conflict of race against race\r\nand of religion against religion should for a while have been confused by\r\nsome of the leading Ministers of Europe with the attempt of a party to make\r\nthe form of domestic government more liberal. The Hellenic rising had\r\nindeed no feature in common with the revolutions of Naples and Cadiz; and,\r\nalthough in order of time the opening of the Greek movement long preceded\r\nthe close of the Spanish movement, the historian, who has neither the\r\npolitician's motive for making a confusion, nor the protection of his\r\nexcuse of ignorance, must in this case neglect the accidents of chronology,\r\nand treat the two as altogether apart.\r\n\r\n[Spain between 1814 and 1820.]\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand of Spain, after overthrowing the Constitution which he found\r\nin existence on his return to his country, had conducted himself as if his\r\nobject had been to show to what lengths a legitimate monarch might abuse\r\nthe fidelity of his subjects and defy the public opinion of Europe. The\r\nleaders of the Cortes, whom he had arrested in 1814, after being declared\r\ninnocent by one tribunal after another were sentenced to long terms of\r\nimprisonment by an arbitrary decree of the King, without even the pretence\r\nof judicial forms. Men who had been conspicuous in the struggle of the\r\nnation against Napoleon were neglected or disgraced; many of the highest\r\nposts were filled by politicians who had played a double part, or had even\r\nserved under the invader. Priests and courtiers intrigued for influence\r\nover the King; even when a capable Minister was placed in power through the\r\npressure of the ambassadors, and the King's name was set to edicts of\r\nadministrative reform, these edicts were made a dead letter by the powerful\r\nband who lived upon the corruption of the public service. Nothing was\r\nsacred except the interest of the clergy; this, however, was enough to keep\r\nthe rural population on the King's side. The peasant, who knew that his\r\nhouse would not now be burnt by the French, and who heard that true\r\nreligion had at length triumphed over its enemies, understood, and cared to\r\nunderstand, nothing more. Rumours of kingly misgovernment and oppression\r\nscarcely reached his ears. Ferdinand was still the child of Spain and of\r\nthe Church; his return had been the return of peace; his rule was the\r\nvictory of the Catholic faith.\r\n\r\n[The nation satisfied: the officers discontented.]\r\n\r\nBut the acquiescence of the mass of the people was not shared by the\r\nofficers of the army and the educated classes in the towns. The overthrow\r\nof the Constitution was from the first condemned by soldiers who had won\r\ndistinction under the government of the Cortes; and a series of military\r\nrebellion, though isolated and on the smallest scale, showed that the\r\ncourse on which Ferdinand had entered was not altogether free from danger.\r\nThe attempts of General Mina in 1814, and of Porlier and Lacy in succeeding\r\nyears, to raise the soldiery on behalf of the Constitution, failed, through\r\nthe indifference of the soldiery themselves, and the power which the\r\npriesthood exercised in garrison-towns. Discontent made its way in the army\r\nby slow degrees; and the ultimate declaration of a military party against\r\nthe existing Government was due at least as much to Ferdinand's absurd\r\nsystem of favouritism, and to the wretched condition into which the army\r\nhad been thrown, as to an attachment to the memory or the principles of\r\nconstitutional rule. Misgovernment made the treasury bankrupt; soldiers and\r\nsailors received no pay for years together; and the hatred with which the\r\nSpanish people had now come to regard military service is curiously shown\r\nby an order of the Government that all the beggars in Madrid and other\r\ngreat towns should be seized on a certain night (July 23, 1816), and\r\nenrolled in the army. [307] But the very beggars were more than a match for\r\nFerdinand's administration. They heard of the fate in store for them, and\r\nmysteriously disappeared, so frustrating a measure by which it had been\r\ncalculated that Spain would gain sixty thousand warriors.\r\n\r\n[Struggle of Spain with its colonies, 1810-1820.]\r\n\r\nThe military revolution which at length broke out in the year 1820 was\r\nclosely connected with the struggle for independence now being made by the\r\nAmerican colonies of Spain; and in its turn it affected the course of this\r\nstruggle and its final result. The colonies had refused to accept the rule\r\neither of Joseph Bonaparte or of the Cortes of Cadiz when their legitimate\r\nsovereign was dispossessed by Napoleon. While acting for the most part in\r\nFerdinand's name, they had engaged in a struggle with the National\r\nGovernment of Spain. They had tasted independence; and although after the\r\nrestoration of Ferdinand they would probably have recognised the rights of\r\nthe Spanish Crown if certain concessions had been made, they were not\r\ndisposed to return to the condition of inferiority in which they had been\r\nheld during the last century, or to submit to rulers who proved themselves\r\nas cruel and vindictive in moments of victory as they were incapable of\r\nunderstanding the needs of the time. The struggle accordingly continued.\r\nRegiment after regiment was sent from Spain, to perish of fever, of forced\r\nmarches, or on the field. The Government of King Ferdinand, despairing of\r\nits own resources, looked around for help among the European Powers.\r\nEngland would have lent its mediation, and possibly even armed assistance,\r\nif the Court of Madrid would have granted a reasonable amount of freedom to\r\nthe colonies, and have opened their ports to British commerce. This,\r\nhowever, was not in accordance with the views of Ferdinand's advisers.\r\nStrange as it may appear, the Spanish Government demanded that the alliance\r\nof Sovereigns, which had been framed for the purpose of resisting the\r\nprinciple of rebellion and disorder in Europe, should intervene against its\r\nrevolted subjects on the other side of the Atlantic, and it implied that\r\nEngland, if acting at all, should act as the instrument of the Alliance.\r\n[308] Encouragement was given to the design by the Courts of Paris and St.\r\nPetersburg. Whether a continent claimed its independence, or a German\r\nschoolboy wore a forbidden ribbon in his cap, the chiefs of the Holy\r\nAlliance now assumed the frown of offended Providence, and prepared to\r\ninterpose their own superior power and wisdom to save a misguided world\r\nfrom the consequences of its own folly. Alexander had indeed for a time\r\nhoped that the means of subduing the colonies might be supplied by himself;\r\nand in his zeal to supplant England in the good graces of Ferdinand he sold\r\nthe King a fleet of war on very moderate terms. To the scandal of Europe\r\nthe ships, when they reached Cadiz, turned out to be thoroughly rotten and\r\nunseaworthy. As it was certain that the Czar's fleet and the Spanish\r\nsoldiers, however holy their mission, would all go to the bottom together\r\nas soon as they encountered the waves of the Atlantic, the expedition was\r\npostponed, and the affairs of America were brought before the Conference of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle. The Envoys of Russia and France submitted a paper, in\r\nwhich, anticipating the storm-warnings of more recent times, they described\r\nthe dangers to which monarchical Europe would be exposed from the growth of\r\na federation of republics in America; and they suggested that Wellington,\r\nas \"the man of Europe,\" should go to Madrid, to preside over a negotiation\r\nbetween the Court of Spain and all the ambassadors with reference to the\r\nterms to be offered to the Transatlantic States. [309] England, however, in\r\nspite of Lord Castlereagh's dread of revolutionary contagion, adhered to\r\nthe principles which it had already laid down; and as the counsellors of\r\nKing Ferdinand declined to change their policy, Spain was left to subdue\r\nits colonies by itself.\r\n\r\n[Conspiracy in the Army of Cadiz.]\r\n\r\nIt was in the army assembled at Cadiz for embarkation in the summer of 1819\r\nthat the conspiracy against Ferdinand's Government found its leaders.\r\nSecret societies had now spread themselves over the principal Spanish\r\ntowns, and looked to the soldiery on the coast for the signal of revolt.\r\nAbisbal, commander at Cadiz, intending to make himself safe against all\r\ncontingencies, encouraged for awhile the plots of the discontented\r\nofficers: then, foreseeing the failure of the movement, he arrested the\r\nprincipal men by a stratagem, and went off to Madrid, to reveal the\r\nconspiracy to the Court and to take credit for saving the King's crown\r\n(July, 1819). [310] If the army could have been immediately despatched to\r\nAmerica, the danger would possibly have passed away. This, however, was\r\nprevented by an outbreak of yellow fever, which made it necessary to send\r\nthe troops into cantonments for several months. The conspirators gained\r\ntime to renew their plans. The common soldiers, who had hitherto been\r\nfaithful to the Government, heard in their own squalor and inaction the\r\nfearful stories of the few sick and wounded who returned from beyond the\r\nseas, and learnt to regard the order of embarkation as a sentence of death.\r\nSeveral battalions were won over to the cause of constitutional liberty by\r\ntheir commanders. The leaders imprisoned a few months before were again in\r\ncommunication with their followers. After the treachery of Abisbal, it was\r\nagreed to carry out the revolt without the assistance of generals or\r\ngrandees. The leaders chosen were two colonels, Quiroga and Riego, of whom\r\nthe former was in nominal confinement in a monastery near Medina Sidonia,\r\ntwenty miles east of Cadiz, while Riego was stationed at Cabezas, a few\r\nmarches distant on the great road to Seville. The first day of the year\r\n1820 was fixed for the insurrection. It was determined that Riego should\r\ndescend upon the head-quarters, which were at Arcos, and arrest the\r\ngenerals before they could hear anything of the movement, while Quiroga,\r\nmoving from the east, gathered up the battalions stationed on the road, and\r\nthrew himself into Cadiz, there to await his colleague's approach.\r\n\r\n[Action of Quiroga and Riego, Jan. 1820.]\r\n\r\nThe first step in the enterprise proved successful. Riego, proclaiming the\r\nConstitution of 1812, surprised the headquarters, seized the generals, and\r\nrallied several companies to his standard. Quiroga, however, though he\r\ngained possession of San Fernando, at the eastern end of the peninsula of\r\nLeon, on which Cadiz is situated, failed to make his entrance into Cadiz.\r\nThe commandant, hearing of the capture of the head-quarters, had closed the\r\ncity gates, and arrested the principal inhabitants whom he suspected of\r\nbeing concerned in the plot. The troops within the town showed no sign of\r\nmutiny. Riego, when he arrived at the peninsula of Leon, found that only\r\nfive thousand men in all had joined the good cause, while Cadiz, with a\r\nconsiderable garrison and fortifications of great strength, stood hostile\r\nbefore him. He accordingly set off with a small force to visit and win over\r\nthe other regiments which were lying in the neighbouring towns and\r\nvillages. The commanders, however, while not venturing to attack the\r\nmutineers, drew off their troops to a distance, and prevented them from\r\nentering into any communication with Riego. The adventurous soldier,\r\nleaving Quiroga in the peninsula of Leon, then marched into the interior of\r\nAndalusia (January 27), endeavouring to raise the inhabitants of the towns.\r\nBut the small numbers of his band, and the knowledge that Cadiz and the\r\ngreater part of the army still held by the Government, prevented the\r\ninhabitants from joining the insurrection, even where they received Riego\r\nwith kindness and supplied the wants of his soldiers. During week after\r\nweek the little column traversed the country, now cut off from retreat,\r\nexhausted by forced marches in drenching rain, and harassed by far stronger\r\nforces sent in pursuit. The last town that Riego entered was Cordova. The\r\nenemy was close behind him. No halt was possible. He led his band, now\r\nnumbering only two hundred men, into the mountains, and there bade them\r\ndisperse (March 11).\r\n\r\n[Corunna proclaims the Constitution Feb. 20.]\r\n\r\n[Abisbal's defection March 4.]\r\n\r\nWith Quiroga lying inactive in the peninsula of Leon and Riego hunted from\r\nvillage to village, it seemed as if the insurrection which they had begun\r\ncould only end in the ruin of its leaders. But the movement had in fact\r\neffected its object. While the courtiers around King Ferdinand, unwarned by\r\nthe news from Cadiz, continued their intrigues against one another, the\r\nrumour of rebellion spread over the country. If no great success had been\r\nachieved by the rebels, it was also certain that no great blow had been\r\nstruck by the Government. The example of bold action had been set; the\r\nshock given at one end of the peninsula was felt at the other; and a\r\nfortnight before Riego's band dispersed, the garrison and the citizens of\r\nCorunna together declared for the Constitution (February 20). From Corunna\r\nthe revolutionary movement spread to Ferrol and to all the other\r\ncoast-towns of Galicia. The news reached Madrid, terrifying the Government,\r\nand exciting the spirit of insurrection in the capital itself. The King\r\nsummoned a council of the leading men around him. The wisest of them\r\nadvised him to publish a moderate Constitution, and, by convoking a\r\nParliament immediately, to stay the movement, which would otherwise result\r\nin the restoration of the Assembly and the Constitution of 1812. They also\r\nurged the King to abolish the Inquisition forthwith. Ferdinand's brother,\r\nDon Carlos, the head of the clerical party, succeeded in preventing both\r\nmeasures. Though the generals in all quarters of Spain wrote that they\r\ncould not answer for the troops, there were still hopes of keeping down the\r\ncountry by force of arms. Abisbal, who was at Madrid, was ordered to move\r\nwith reinforcements towards the army in the south. He set out, protesting\r\nto the King that he knew the way to deal with rebels. When he reached Ocaña\r\nhe proclaimed the Constitution himself (March 4).\r\n\r\n[Ferdinand accepts the Constitution 1812, March 9.]\r\n\r\nIt was now clear that the cause of absolute monarchy was lost. The ferment\r\nin Madrid increased. On the night of the 6th of March all the great bodies\r\nof State assembled for council in the King's palace, and early on the 7th\r\nFerdinand published a proclamation, stating that he had determined to\r\nsummon the Cortes immediately. This declaration satisfied no one, for the\r\nCortes designed by the King might be the mere revival of a mediæval form,\r\nand the history of 1814 showed how little value was to be attached to\r\nFerdinand's promises. Crowds gathered in the great squares of Madrid,\r\ncrying for the Constitution of 1812. The statement of the Minister of War\r\nthat the Guard was on the point of joining the people now overcame even the\r\nresistance of Don Carlos and the confessors; and after a day wasted in\r\ndispute, Ferdinand announced to his people that he was ready to take the\r\noath to the Constitution which they desired. The next day was given up to\r\npublic rejoicings; the book of the Constitution was carried in procession\r\nthrough the city with the honours paid to the Holy Sacrament, and all\r\npolitical prisoners were set at liberty. The prison of the Inquisition was\r\nsacked, the instruments of torture broken in pieces. On the 9th the leaders\r\nof the agitation took steps to make the King fulfil his promise. A mob\r\ninvaded the court and threshold of the palace. At their demand the\r\nmunicipal council of 1814 was restored; its members were sent, in company\r\nwith six deputies chosen by the populace, to receive the pledges of the\r\nKing. Ferdinand, all smiles and bows, while he looked forward to the day\r\nwhen force or intrigue should make him again absolute master of Spain, and\r\nenable him to take vengeance upon the men who were humiliating, him, took\r\nthe oath of fidelity to the Constitution of 1812. [311] New Ministers were\r\nimmediately called to office, and a provisional Junta was placed by their\r\nside as the representative of the public until the new Cortes should be\r\nduly elected.\r\n\r\n[Condition of Naples, 1815-1820.]\r\n\r\nTidings of the Spanish revolution passed rapidly over Europe, disquieting\r\nthe courts and everywhere reviving the hopes of the friends of popular\r\nright. Before four months had passed, the constitutional movement begun in\r\nCadiz was taken up in Southern Italy. The kingdom of Naples was one of\r\nthose States which had profited the most by French conquest. During the\r\nnine years that its crown was held by Joseph Bonaparte and Murat, the laws\r\nand institutions which accompanied Napoleon's supremacy had rudely broken\r\nup the ancient fixity of confusions which passed for government, and had\r\naroused no insignificant forces of new social life. The feudal tenure of\r\nland, and with it something of the feudal structure of society, had passed\r\naway: the monasteries had been dissolved; the French civil code, and a\r\ncriminal code based upon that of France, had taken the place of a thousand\r\nconflicting customs and jurisdictions; taxation had been made, if not\r\nlight, yet equitable and simple; justice was regular, and the same for\r\nbaron and peasant; brigandage had been extinguished; and, for the first\r\ntime in many centuries, the presence of a rational and uniform\r\nadministration was felt over all the south of Italy. Nor on the restoration\r\nof King Ferdinand had any reaction been permitted to take place like that\r\nwhich in a moment destroyed the work of reform in Spain and in Westphalia.\r\nEngland and Austria insisted that there should be neither vengeance nor\r\ncounterrevolution. Queen Marie Caroline, the principal agent in the\r\ncruelties of 1799, was dead; Ferdinand himself was old and indolent, and\r\nwilling to leave affairs in the hands of Ministers more intelligent than\r\nhimself. Hence the laws and the administrative system of Murat remained on\r\nthe whole unchanged. [312] As in France, a Bourbon Sovereign placed himself\r\nat the head of a political order fashioned by Napoleon and the Revolution.\r\nWhere changes in the law were made, or acts of State revoked, it was for\r\nthe most part in consequence of an understanding with the Holy See. Thus,\r\nwhile no attempt was made to eject the purchasers of Church-lands, the\r\nlands not actually sold were given back to the Church; a considerable\r\nnumber of monasteries were restored; education was allowed to fall again\r\ninto the hands of the clergy; the Jesuits were recalled, and the Church\r\nregained its jurisdiction in marriage-causes, as well as the right of\r\nsuppressing writings at variance with the Catholic faith.\r\n\r\n[Hostility between the Court party and the Muratists.]\r\n\r\nBut the legal and recognised changes which followed Ferdinand's return by\r\nno means expressed the whole change in the operation of government. If\r\nthere were not two conflicting systems at work, there were two conflicting\r\nbodies of partisans in the State. Like the emigrants who returned with\r\nLouis XVIII., a multitude of Neapolitans, high and low, who had either\r\naccompanied the King in his exile to Sicily or fought for him on the\r\nmainland in 1799 and 1806, now expected their reward. In their interest the\r\nefficiency of the public service was sacrificed and the course of justice\r\nperverted. Men who had committed notorious crimes escaped punishment if\r\nthey had been numbered among the King's friends; the generals and officials\r\nwho had served under Murat, though not removed from their posts, were\r\ntreated with discourtesy and suspicion. It was in the army most of all that\r\nthe antagonism of the two parties was felt. A medal was struck for service\r\nin Sicily, and every year spent there in inaction was reckoned as two in\r\ncomputing seniority. Thus the younger officers of Murat found their way\r\nblocked by a troop of idlers, and at the same time their prospects suffered\r\nfrom the honest attempts made by Ministers to reduce the military\r\nexpenditure. Discontent existed in every rank. The generals were familiar\r\nwith the idea of political change, for during the last years of Murat's\r\nreign they had themselves thought of compelling him to grant a\r\nConstitution: the younger officers and the sergeants were in great part\r\nmembers of the secret society of the Carbonari, which in the course of the\r\nlast few years had grown with the weakness of the Government, and had now\r\nbecome the principal power in the Neapolitan kingdom.\r\n\r\n[The Carbonari.]\r\n\r\nThe origin of this society, which derived its name and its symbolism from\r\nthe trade of the charcoal-burner, as Freemasonry from that of the builder,\r\nis uncertain. Whether its first aim was resistance to Bourbon tyranny after\r\n1799, or the expulsion of the French and Austrians from Italy, in the year\r\n1814 it was actively working for constitutional government in opposition to\r\nMurat, and receiving encouragement from Sicily, where Ferdinand was then\r\nplaying the part of constitutional King. The maintenance of absolute\r\ngovernment by the restored Bourbon Court severed the bond which for a time\r\nexisted between legitimate monarchy and conspiracy; and the lodges of the\r\nCarbonari, now extending themselves over the country with great rapidity,\r\nbecame so many centres of agitation against despotic rule. By the year 1819\r\nit was reckoned that one person out of every twenty-five in the kingdom of\r\nNaples had joined the society. Its members were drawn from all classes,\r\nmost numerously perhaps from the middle class in the towns; but even\r\npriests had been initiated, and there was no branch of the public service\r\nthat had not Carbonari in its ranks. The Government, apprehending danger\r\nfrom the extension of the sect, tried to counteract it by founding a rival\r\nsociety of Calderari, or Braziers, in which every miscreant who before 1815\r\nhad murdered and robbed in the name of King Ferdinand and the Catholic\r\nfaith received a welcome. But though the number of such persons was not\r\nsmall, the growth of this fraternity remained far behind that of its model;\r\nand the chief result of the competition was that intrigue and mystery\r\ngained a greater charm than ever for the Italians, and that all confidence\r\nin Government perished, under the sense that there was a hidden power in\r\nthe land which was only awaiting the due moment to put forth its strength\r\nin revolutionary action.\r\n\r\n[Morelli's movement, July 2, 1820.]\r\n\r\nAfter the proclamation of the Spanish Constitution, an outbreak in the\r\nkingdom of Naples had become inevitable. The Carbonari of Salerno, where\r\nthe sect had its headquarters, had intended to rise at the beginning of\r\nJune; their action, however, was postponed for some months, and it was\r\nanticipated by the daring movement of a few sergeants belonging to a\r\ncavalry regiment stationed at Nola, and of a lieutenant, named Morelli,\r\nwhom they had persuaded to place himself at their head. Leading out a\r\nsquadron of a hundred and fifty men in the direction of Avellino on the\r\nmorning of July 2nd, Morelli proclaimed the Constitution. One of the\r\nsoldiers alone left the band; force or persuasion kept others to the\r\nStandard, though they disapproved of the enterprise. The inhabitants of the\r\npopulous places that lie between Nola and Avellino welcomed the squadron,\r\nor at least offered it no opposition: the officer commanding at Avellino\r\ncame himself to meet Morelli, and promised him assistance. The band\r\nencamped that night in a village; on the next day they entered Avellino,\r\nwhere the troops and townspeople, headed by the bishop and officers,\r\ndeclared in their favour. From Avellino the news of the movement spread\r\nquickly over the surrounding country. The Carbonari were everywhere\r\nprepared for revolt; and before the Government had taken a single step in\r\nits own defence, the Constitution had been joyfully and peacefully\r\naccepted, not only by the people but by the militia and the regular troops,\r\nthroughout the greater part of the district that lies to the east of\r\nNaples.\r\n\r\n[Affairs at Naples, July 2-7.]\r\n\r\nThe King was on board ship in the bay, when, in the afternoon of July 2nd,\r\nintelligence came of Morelli's revolt at Nola. Nothing was done by the\r\nMinistry on that day, although Morelli and his band might have been\r\ncaptured in a few hours if any resolute officer, with a few trustworthy\r\ntroops, had been sent against them. On the next morning, when the garrison\r\nof Avellino had already joined the mutineers, and taken up a strong\r\nposition commanding the road from Naples, General Carrascosa was sent, not\r\nto reduce the insurgents--for no troops were given to him--but to pardon,\r\nto bribe, and to coax them into submission. [313] Carrascosa failed to\r\neffect any good; other generals, who, during the following days, attempted\r\nto attack the mutineers, found that their troops would not follow them, and\r\nthat the feeling of opposition to the Government, though it nowhere broke\r\ninto lawlessness, was universal in the army as well as the nation. If the\r\npeople generally understood little of politics, they had learnt enough to\r\ndislike arbitrary taxation and the power of arbitrary arrest. Not a single\r\nhand or voice was anywhere raised in defence of absolutism. Escaping from\r\nNaples, where he was watched by the Government, General Pepe, who was at\r\nonce the chief man among the Carbonari and military commandant of the\r\nprovince in which Avellino lies, went to place himself at the head of the\r\nrevolution. Naples itself had hitherto remained quiet, but on the night of\r\nJuly 6th a deputation from the Carbonari informed the King that they could\r\nno longer preserve tranquillity in the city unless a Constitution was\r\ngranted. The King, without waiting for morning, published an edict\r\ndeclaring that a Constitution should be drawn up within eight days;\r\nimmediately afterwards he appointed a new Ministry, and, feigning illness,\r\ncommitted the exercise of royal authority to his son, the Duke of Calabria.\r\n\r\n[Ferdinand takes the Oath to the Spanish Constitution, July 13.]\r\n\r\nFerdinand's action was taken by the people as a stratagem. He had employed\r\nthe device of a temporary abdication some years before in cajoling the\r\nSicilians; and the delay of eight days seemed unnecessary to ardent souls\r\nwho knew that a Spanish Constitution was in existence and did not know of\r\nits defects in practice. There was also on the side of the Carbonari the\r\ntelling argument that Ferdinand, as a possible successor to his nephew, the\r\nchildless King of Spain, actually had signed the Spanish Constitution in\r\norder to preserve his own contingent rights to that crown. What Ferdinand\r\nhad accepted as Infante of Spain he might well accept as King of Naples.\r\nThe cry was therefore for the immediate proclamation of the Spanish\r\nConstitution of 1812. The court yielded, and the Duke of Calabria, as\r\nviceroy, published an edict making this Constitution the law of the kingdom\r\nof the Two Sicilies. But the tumult continued, for deceit was still feared,\r\nuntil the edict appeared again, signed by the King himself. Then all was\r\nrejoicing. Pepe, at the head of a large body of troops, militia and\r\nCarbonari, made a triumphal entry into the city, and, in company with\r\nMorelli and other leaders of the military rebellion, was hypocritically\r\nthanked by the Viceroy for his services to the nation. On the 13th of July\r\nthe King, a hale but venerable-looking man of seventy, took the oath to the\r\nConstitution before the altar in the royal chapel. The form of words had\r\nbeen written out for him; but Ferdinand was fond of theatrical acts of\r\nreligion, and did not content himself with reading certain solemn phrases.\r\nRaising his eyes to the crucifix above the altar, he uttered aloud a prayer\r\nthat if the oath was not sincerely taken the vengeance of God might fall\r\nupon his head. Then, after blessing and embracing his sons, the venerable\r\nmonarch wrote to the Emperor of Austria, protesting that all that he did\r\nwas done under constraint, and that his obligations were null and void.\r\n[314]\r\n\r\n[Affairs in Portugal, 1807-1820.]\r\n\r\nA month more passed, and in a third kingdom absolute government fell before\r\nthe combined action of soldiers and people. The Court of Lisbon had\r\nmigrated to Brazil in 1807, when the troops of Napoleon first appeared upon\r\nthe Tagus, and Portugal had since then been governed by a Regency, acting\r\nin the name of the absent Sovereign. The events of the Peninsular War had\r\nreduced Portugal almost to the condition of a dependency of Great Britain.\r\nMarshal Beresford, the English commander-in-chief of its army, kept his\r\npost when the war was over, and with him there remained a great number of\r\nEnglish officers who had led the Portuguese regiments in Wellington's\r\ncampaigns. The presence of these English soldiers was unwelcome, and\r\ncommercial rivalry embittered the natural feeling of impatience towards an\r\nally who remained as master rather than guest. Up to the year 1807 the\r\nentire trade with Brazil had been confined by law to Portuguese merchants;\r\nwhen, however, the Court had established itself beyond the Atlantic, it had\r\nopened the ports of Brazil to British ships, in return for the assistance\r\ngiven by our own country against Napoleon. Both England and Brazil profited\r\nby the new commerce, but the Portuguese traders, who had of old had the\r\nmonopoly, were ruined. The change in the seat of government was in fact\r\nseen to be nothing less than a reversal of the old relations between the\r\nEuropean country and its colony. Hitherto Brazil had been governed in the\r\ninterests of Portugal; but with a Sovereign fixed at Rio Janeiro, it was\r\nalmost inevitable that Portugal should be governed in the interests of\r\nBrazil. Declining trade, the misery and impoverishment resulting from a\r\nlong war, resentment against a Court which could not be induced to return\r\nto the kingdom and against a foreigner who could not be induced to quit it,\r\nfilled the army and all classes in the nation with discontent. Conspiracies\r\nwere discovered as early as 1817, and the conspirators punished with all\r\nthe barbarous ferocity of the Middle Ages. Beresford, who had not\r\nsufficient tact to prevent the execution of a sentence ordering twelve\r\npersons to be strangled, beheaded, and then burnt in the streets of Lisbon,\r\nfound, during the two succeeding years, that the state of the country was\r\nbecoming worse and worse. In the spring of 1820, when the Spanish\r\nrevolution had made some change in the neighbouring kingdom, either for\r\ngood or evil, inevitable, Beresford set out for Rio Janeiro, intending to\r\nacquaint the King with the real condition of affairs, and to use his\r\npersonal efforts in hastening the return of the Court to Lisbon. Before he\r\ncould recross the Atlantic, the Government which he left behind him at\r\nLisbon had fallen.\r\n\r\n[Revolution at Oporto, August 1820.]\r\n\r\nThe grievances of the Portuguese army made it the natural centre of\r\ndisaffection, but the military conspirators had their friends among all\r\nclasses. On the 24th of August, 1820, the signal of revolt was given at\r\nOporto. Priests and magistrates, as well as the town-population, united\r\nwith officers of the army in declaring against the Regency, and in\r\nestablishing a provisional Junta, charged with the duty of carrying on the\r\ngovernment in the name of the King until the Cortes should assemble and\r\nframe a Constitution. No resistance was offered by any of the civil or\r\nmilitary authorities at Oporto. The Junta entered upon its functions, and\r\nbegan by dismissing all English officers, and making up the arrears of pay\r\ndue to the soldiers. As soon as the news of the revolt reached Lisbon, the\r\nRegency itself volunteered to summon the Cortes, and attempted to\r\nconciliate the remainder of the army by imitating the measures of the Junta\r\nof Oporto. [315] The troops, however, declined to act against their\r\ncomrades, and on the 15th of September the Regency was deposed, and a\r\nprovisional Junta installed in the capital. Beresford, who now returned\r\nfrom Brazil, was forbidden to set foot on Portuguese soil. The two rival\r\ngoverning-committees of Lisbon and Oporto coalesced; and after an interval\r\nof confusion the elections to the Cortes were held, resulting in the return\r\nof a body of men whose loyalty to the Crown was not impaired by their\r\nhostility to the Regency. The King, when the first tidings of the\r\nconstitutional movement reached Brazil, gave a qualified consent to the\r\nsummoning of the Cortes which was announced by the Regency, and promised to\r\nreturn to Europe. Beresford, continuing his voyage to England without\r\nlanding at Lisbon, found that the Government of this country had no\r\ndisposition to interfere with the domestic affairs of its ally.\r\n\r\n[Alexander proposes joint action with regard to Spain, April, 1820.]\r\n\r\nIt was the boast of the Spanish and Italian Liberals that the revolutions\r\neffected in 1820 were undisgraced by the scenes of outrage which had\r\nfollowed the capture of the Bastille and the overthrow of French absolutism\r\nthirty years before. [316] The gentler character of these southern\r\nmovements proved, however, no extenuation in the eyes of the leading\r\nstatesmen of Europe: on the contrary, the declaration of soldiers in favour\r\nof a Constitution seemed in some quarters more ominous of evil than any\r\nexcess of popular violence. The alarm was first sounded at St. Petersburg.\r\nAs soon as the Czar heard of Riego's proceedings at Cadiz, he began to\r\nmeditate intervention; and when it was known that Ferdinand had been forced\r\nto accept the Constitution of 1812, he ordered his ambassadors to propose\r\nthat all the Great Powers, acting through their Ministers at Paris, should\r\naddress a remonstrance to the representative of Spain, requiring the Cortes\r\nto disavow the crime of the 8th of March, by which they had been called\r\ninto being, and to offer a pledge of obedience to their King by enacting\r\nthe most rigorous laws against sedition and revolt. [317] In that case, and\r\nin that alone, the Czar desired to add, would the Powers maintain their\r\nrelations of confidence and amity with Spain.\r\n\r\n[England prevents joint diplomatic intervention.]\r\n\r\nThis Russian proposal was viewed with some suspicion at Vienna; it was\r\nanswered with a direct and energetic negative from London. Canning was\r\nstill in the Ministry. The words with which in 1818 he had protested\r\nagainst a league between England and autocracy were still ringing in the\r\nears of his colleagues. Lord Liverpool's Government knew itself to be\r\nunpopular in the country; every consideration of policy as well as of\r\nself-interest bade it resist the beginnings of an intervention which, if\r\nconfined to words, was certain to be useless, and, if supported by action,\r\nwas likely to end in that alliance between France and Russia which had been\r\nthe nightmare of English statesmen ever since 1814, and in a second\r\noccupation of Spain by the very generals whom Wellington had spent so many\r\nyears in dislodging. Castlereagh replied to the Czar's note in terms which\r\nmade it clear that England would never give its sanction to a collective\r\ninterference with Spain. [318] Richelieu, the nominal head of the French\r\nGovernment, felt too little confidence in his position to act without the\r\nconcurrence of Great Britain; and the crusade of absolutism against Spanish\r\nliberty was in consequence postponed until the victory of the\r\nUltra-Royalists at Paris was complete, and the overthrow of Richelieu had\r\nbrought to the head of the French State a group of men who felt no scruple\r\nin entering upon an aggressive war.\r\n\r\n[Naples and the Great Powers.]\r\n\r\n[Austria.]\r\n\r\n[England admits Austrian but not joint intervention.]\r\n\r\nBut the shelter of circumstances which for a while protected Spain from the\r\nforeigner did not extend to Italy, when in its turn the Neapolitan\r\nrevolution called a northern enemy into the field. Though the kingdom of\r\nthe Two Sicilies was in itself much less important than Spain, the\r\nestablished order of the Continent was more directly threatened by a change\r\nin its government. No European State was exposed to the same danger from a\r\nrevolution in Madrid as Austria from a revolution in Naples. The Czar had\r\ninvoked the action of the Courts against Spain, not because his own\r\ndominions were in peril, but because the principle of monarchical right was\r\nviolated: with Austria the danger pressed nearer home. The establishment of\r\nconstitutional liberty in Naples was almost certain to be followed by an\r\ninsurrection in the Papal States and a national uprising in the Venetian\r\nprovinces; and among all the bad results of Austria's false position in\r\nItaly, one of the worst was that in self-defence it was bound to resist\r\nevery step made towards political liberty beyond its own frontier. The\r\ndismay with which Metternich heard of the collapse of absolute government\r\nat Naples [319] was understood and even shared by the English Ministry, who\r\nat this moment were deprived of their best guide by Canning's withdrawal.\r\nAustria, in peace just as much as in war, had uniformly been held to be the\r\nnatural ally of England against the two aggressive Courts of Paris and St.\r\nPetersburg. It seemed perfectly right and natural to Lord Castlereagh that\r\nAustria, when its own interests were endangered by the establishment of\r\npopular sovereignty at Naples, should intervene to restore King Ferdinand's\r\npower; the more so as the secret treaty of 1815, by which Metternich had\r\nbound this sovereign to maintain absolute monarchy, had been communicated\r\nto the ambassador of Great Britain, and had received his approval. But the\r\nright to intervene in Italy belonged, according to Lord Castlereagh, to\r\nAustria alone. The Sovereigns of Europe had no more claim, as a body, to\r\ninterfere with Naples than they had to interfere with Spain. Therefore,\r\nwhile the English Government sanctioned and even desired the intervention\r\nof Austria, as a State acting in protection of its own interests against\r\nrevolution in a neighbouring country, it refused to sanction any joint\r\nintervention of the European Powers, and declared itself opposed to the\r\nmeeting of a Congress where any such intervention might be discussed. [320]\r\n\r\n[Conference at Troppau, Oct. 1820.]\r\n\r\nHad Metternich been free to follow his own impulses, he would have thrown\r\nan army into Southern Italy as soon as soldiers and stores could be\r\ncollected, and have made an end of King Ferdinand's troubles forthwith. It\r\nwas, however, impossible for him to disregard the wishes of the Czar, and\r\nto abandon all at once the system of corporate action, which was supposed\r\nto have done such great things for Europe. [321] A meeting of sovereigns\r\nand Ministers was accordingly arranged, and at the end of October the\r\nEmperor of Austria received the Czar and King Frederick William in the\r\nlittle town of Troppau, in Moravia. France had itself first recommended the\r\nsummoning of a Congress to deal with Neapolitan affairs, and it was\r\nbelieved for a while that England would be isolated in its resistance to a\r\njoint intervention. But before the Congress assembled, the firm language of\r\nthe English Ministry had drawn Richelieu over to its side; [322] and\r\nalthough one of the two French envoys made himself the agent of the\r\nUltra-Royalist faction, it was not possible for him to unite his country\r\nwith the three Eastern Courts. France, through the weakness of its\r\nGovernment and the dissension between its representatives, counted for\r\nnothing at the Congress. England sent its ambassador from Vienna, but with\r\ninstructions to act as an observer and little more; and in consequence the\r\nmeeting at Troppau resolved itself into a gathering of the three Eastern\r\nautocrats and their Ministers. As Prussia had ceased to have any\r\nindependent foreign policy whatever, Metternich needed only to make certain\r\nof the support of the Czar in order to range on his side the entire force\r\nof eastern and central Europe in the restoration of Neapolitan despotism.\r\n\r\n[Contest between Metternich and Capodistrias.]\r\n\r\n[Circular of Troppau, Dec. 8, 1820.]\r\n\r\n[The principle of intervention laid down by three Courts.]\r\n\r\nThe plan of the Austrian statesman was not, however, to be realised without\r\nsome effort. Alexander had watched with jealousy Metternich's recent\r\nassumption of a dictatorship over the minor German Courts; he had never\r\nadmitted Austria's right to dominate in Italy; and even now some vestiges\r\nof his old attachment to liberal theories made him look for a better\r\nsolution of the Neapolitan problem than in that restoration of despotism\r\npure and simple which Austria desired. While condemning every attempt of a\r\npeople to establish its own liberties, Alexander still believed that in\r\nsome countries sovereigns would do well to make their subjects a grant of\r\nwhat he called sage and liberal institutions. It would have pleased him\r\nbest if the Neapolitans could have been induced by peaceful means to\r\nabandon their Constitution, and to accept in return certain chartered\r\nrights as a gift from their King; and the concurrence of the two Western\r\nPowers might in this case possibly have been regained. This project of a\r\ncompromise, by which Ferdinand would have been freed from his secret\r\nengagement with Austria, was exactly what Metternich desired to frustrate.\r\nHe found himself matched, and not for the first time, against a statesman\r\nwho was even more subtle than himself. This was Count Capodistrias, a Greek\r\nwho from a private position had risen to be Foreign Minister of Russia, and\r\nwas destined to become the first sovereign, in reality if not in title, of\r\nhis native land. Capodistrias, the sympathetic partner of the Czar's\r\nearlier hopes, had not travelled so fast as his master along the\r\nreactionary road. He still represented what had been the Italian policy of\r\nAlexander some years before, and sought to prevent the re-establishment of\r\nabsolute rule at Naples, at least by the armed intervention of Austria.\r\nMetternich's first object was to discredit the Minister in the eyes of his\r\nsovereign. It is said that he touched the Czar's keenest fears in a\r\nconversation relating to a mutiny that had just taken place among the\r\ntroops at St. Petersburg, and so in one private interview cut the ground\r\nfrom under Capodistrias' feet; he also humoured the Czar by reviving that\r\nmonarch's own favourite scheme for a mutual guarantee of all the Powers\r\nagainst revolution in any part of Europe. Alexander had proposed in 1818\r\nthat the Courts should declare resistance to authority in any country to be\r\na violation of European peace, entitling the Allied Powers, if they should\r\nthink fit, to suppress it by force of arms. This doctrine, which would have\r\nempowered the Czar to throw the armies of a coalition upon London if the\r\nReform Bill had been carried by force, had hitherto failed to gain\r\ninternational acceptance owing to the opposition of Great Britain. It was\r\nnow formally accepted by Austria and Prussia. Alexander saw the federative\r\nsystem of European monarchy, with its principle of collective intervention,\r\nrecognised as an established fact by at least three of the great Powers;\r\n[323] and in return he permitted Metternich to lay down the lines which, in\r\nthe case of Naples, this intervention should follow. It was determined to\r\ninvite King Ferdinand to meet his brother-sovereigns at Laibach, in the\r\nAustrian province of Carniola, and through him to address a summons to the\r\nNeapolitan people, requiring them, in the name of the three Powers, and\r\nunder threat of invasion, to abandon their Constitution. This determination\r\nwas announced, as a settled matter, to the envoys of England and France;\r\nand a circular was issued from Troppau by the three Powers to all the\r\nCourts of Europe (Dec. 8), embodying the doctrine of federative\r\nintervention, and expressing a hope that England and France would approve\r\nits immediate application in the case of Naples. [324]\r\n\r\n[Protest of England.]\r\n\r\nThere was no ground whatever for this hope with regard to England. On the\r\ncontrary, in proportion as the three Courts strengthened their union and\r\ninsisted on their claim to joint jurisdiction over Europe, they drove\r\nEngland away from them. Lord Castlereagh had at first promised the moral\r\nsupport of this country to Austria in its enterprise against Naples; but\r\nwhen this enterprise ceased to be the affair of Austria alone, and became\r\npart of the police-system of the three despotisms, it was no longer\r\npossible for the English Government to view it with approval or even with\r\nsilence. The promise of a moral support was withdrawn: England declared\r\nthat it stood strictly neutral with regard to Naples, and protested against\r\nthe doctrine contained in the Troppau circular, that a change of government\r\nin any State gave the Allied Powers the right to intervene. [325]\r\n\r\nFrance made no such protest; but it was still hoped at Paris that an\r\nAustrian invasion of Southern Italy, so irritating to French pride, might\r\nbe averted. King Louis XVIII. endeavoured, but in vain, to act the part of\r\nmediator, and to reconcile the Neapolitan House of Bourbon at once with its\r\nown subjects and with the Northern Powers.\r\n\r\n[Conference at Laibach, Jan., 1821.]\r\n\r\nThe summons went out from the Congress to King Ferdinand to appear at\r\nLaibach. It found him enjoying all the popularity of a constitutional King,\r\nsurrounded by Ministers who had governed under Murat, exchanging\r\ncompliments with a democratic Parliament, lavishing distinctions upon the\r\nmen who had overthrown his authority, and swearing to everything that was\r\nset before him. As the Constitution prohibited the King from leaving the\r\ncountry without the consent of the Legislature, it was necessary for\r\nFerdinand to communicate to Parliament the invitation which he had received\r\nfrom the Powers, and to take a vote of the Assembly on the subject of his\r\njourney. Ferdinand's Ministers possessed some political experience; they\r\nrecognised that it would be impossible to maintain the existing\r\nConstitution against the hostility of three great States, and hoped that\r\nthe Parliament would consent to Ferdinand's departure on condition that he\r\npledged himself to uphold certain specified principles of free government.\r\nA message to the Assembly was accordingly made public, in which the King\r\nexpressed his desire to mediate with the Powers on this basis. But the\r\nMinisters had not reckoned with the passions of the people. As soon as it\r\nbecame known that Ferdinand was about to set out, the leaders of the\r\nCarbonari mustered their bands. A host of violent men streamed into Naples\r\nfrom the surrounding country. The Parliament was intimidated, and Ferdinand\r\nwas prohibited from leaving Naples until he had sworn to maintain the\r\nConstitution actually in force, that, namely, which Naples had borrowed\r\nfrom Spain. Ferdinand, whose only object was to escape from the country as\r\nquickly as possible, took the oath with his usual effusions of patriotism.\r\nHe then set out for Leghorn, intending to cross from thence into Northern\r\nItaly. No sooner had he reached the Tuscan port than he addressed a letter\r\nto each of the five principal sovereigns of Europe, declaring that his last\r\nacts were just as much null and void as all his earlier ones. He made no\r\nattempt to justify, or to excuse, or even to explain his conduct; nor is\r\nthere the least reason to suppose that he considered the perjuries of a\r\nprince to require a justification. \"These sorry protests,\" wrote the\r\nsecretary of the Congress of Troppau, \"will happily remain secret. No\r\nCabinet will be anxious to draw them from the sepulchre of its archives.\r\nTill then there is not much harm done.\"\r\n\r\n[Ferdinand at Laibach.]\r\n\r\n[Demands of the Allies on Naples.]\r\n\r\nFerdinand reached Laibach, where the Czar rewarded him for the fatigues of\r\nhis journey by a present of some Russian bears. His arrival was peculiarly\r\nagreeable to Metternich, whose intentions corresponded exactly with his\r\nown; and the fact that he had been compelled to swear to maintain the\r\nSpanish Constitution at Naples acted favourably for the Austrian Minister,\r\ninasmuch as it enabled him to say to all the world that negotiation was now\r\nout of the question. [326] Capodistrias, brought face to face with failure,\r\ntwisted about, according to his rival's expression, like a devil in holy\r\nwater, but all in vain. It was decided that Ferdinand should be restored as\r\nabsolute monarch by an Austrian army, and that, whether the Neapolitans\r\nresisted or submitted, their country should be occupied by Austrian troops\r\nfor some years to come. The only difficulty remaining was to vest King\r\nFerdinand's conduct in some respectable disguise. Capodistrias, when\r\nnothing else was to be gained, offered to invent an entire correspondence,\r\nin which Ferdinand should proudly uphold the Constitution to which he had\r\nsworn, and protest against the determination of the Powers to force the\r\nsceptre of absolutism back into his hand. [327] This device, however, was\r\nthought too transparent. A letter was sent in the King's name to his son,\r\nthe Duke of Calabria, stating that he had found the three Powers determined\r\nnot to tolerate an order of things sprung from revolution; that submission\r\nalone would avert war; but that even in case of submission certain\r\nsecurities for order, meaning the occupation of the country by an Austrian\r\narmy, would be exacted. The letter concluded with the usual promises of\r\nreform and good government. It reached Naples on the 9th of February, 1821.\r\nNo answer was either expected or desired. On the 6th the order had been\r\ngiven to the Austrian army to cross the Po.\r\n\r\n[State of Naples and Sicily.]\r\n\r\n[The Austrians enter Naples, March 24, 1821.]\r\n\r\n[Third Neapolitan restoration.]\r\n\r\nThere was little reason to fear any serious resistance on the part of the\r\nNeapolitans. The administration of the State was thoroughly disorganised;\r\nthe agitation of the secret societies had destroyed all spirit of obedience\r\namong the soldiers; a great part of the army was absent in Sicily, keeping\r\nguard over a people who, under wiser management, might have doubled the\r\nforce which Naples now opposed to the invader. When the despotic government\r\nof Ferdinand was overthrown, the island of Sicily, or that part of it which\r\nwas represented by Palermo, had claimed the separate political existence\r\nwhich it had possessed between 1806 and 1815, offering to remain united to\r\nNaples in the person of the sovereign, but demanding a National Parliament\r\nand a National Constitution of its own. The revolutionary Ministers of\r\nNaples had, however, no more sympathy with the wishes of the Sicilians than\r\nthe Spanish Liberals of 1812 had with those of the American Colonists. They\r\nrequired the islanders to accept the same rights and duties as any other\r\nprovince of the Neapolitan kingdom, and, on their refusal, sent over a\r\nconsiderable force and laid siege to Palermo. [328] The contest soon ended\r\nin the submission of the Sicilians, but it was found necessary to keep\r\ntwelve thousand troops on the island in order to prevent a new revolt. The\r\nwhole regular army of Naples numbered little more than forty thousand; and\r\nalthough bodies of Carbonari and of the so-called Militia set out to join\r\nthe colours of General Pepe and to fight for liberty, they remained for the\r\nmost part a disorderly mob, without either arms or discipline. The invading\r\narmy of Austria, fifty thousand strong, not only possessed an immense\r\nsuperiority in organisation and military spirit, but actually outnumbered\r\nthe forces of the defence. At the first encounter, which took place at\r\nRieti, in the Papal States, the Neapolitans were put to the rout. Their\r\narmy melted away, as it had in Murat's campaign in 1815. Nothing was heard\r\namong officers and men but accusations of treachery; not a single strong\r\npoint was defended; and on the 24th of March the Austrians made their entry\r\ninto Naples. Ferdinand, halting at Florence, sent on before him the worst\r\ninstruments of his former despotism. It was indeed impossible for these men\r\nto renew, under Austrian protection, the scenes of reckless bloodshed which\r\nhad followed the restoration of 1799; and a great number of compromised\r\npersons had already been provided with the means of escape. But the hand of\r\nvengeance was not easily stayed. Courts-martial and commissions of judges\r\nbegan in all parts of the kingdom to sentence to imprisonment and death. An\r\nattempted insurrection in Sicily and some desperate acts of rebellion in\r\nSouthern Italy cost the principal actors their lives; and when an amnesty\r\nwas at length proclaimed, an exception was made against those who were now\r\ncalled the deserters, and who were lately called the Sacred Band, of Nola,\r\nthat is to say, the soldiers who had first risen for the Constitution.\r\nMorelli, who had received the Viceroy's treacherous thanks for his conduct,\r\nwas executed, along with one of his companions; the rest were sent in\r\nchains to labour among felons. Hundreds of persons were left lying,\r\ncondemned or uncondemned, in prison; others, in spite of the amnesty, were\r\ndriven from their native land; and that great, long-lasting stream of\r\nfugitives now began to pour into England, which, in the early memories of\r\nmany who are not yet old, has associated the name of Italian with the image\r\nof an exile and a sufferer.\r\n\r\n[Insurrection in Piedmont, March 10.]\r\n\r\nThere was a moment in the campaign of Austria against Naples when the\r\ninvading army was threatened with the most serious danger. An insurrection\r\nbroke out in Piedmont, and the troops of that country attempted to unite\r\nwith the patriotic party of Lombardy in a movement which would have thrown\r\nall Northern Italy upon the rear of the Austrians. In the first excess of\r\nalarm, the Czar ordered a hundred thousand Russians to cross the Galician\r\nfrontier, and to march in the direction of the Adriatic. It proved\r\nunnecessary, however, to continue this advance. The Piedmontese army was\r\ndivided against itself; part proclaimed the Spanish Constitution, and, on\r\nthe abdication of the King, called upon his cousin, the Regent, Charles\r\nAlbert of Carignano, to march against the Austrians; part adhered to the\r\nrightful heir, the King's brother, Charles Felix, who was absent at Modena,\r\nand who, with an honesty in strong contrast to the frauds of the Neapolitan\r\nCourt, refused to temporise with rebels, or to make any compromise with the\r\nConstitution. The scruples of the Prince of Carignano, after he had gone\r\nsome way with the military party of action, paralysed the movement of\r\nNorthern Italy. Unsupported by Piedmontese troops, the conspirators of\r\nMilan failed to raise any open insurrection. Austrian soldiers thronged\r\nwestwards from the Venetian fortresses, and entered Piedmont itself; the\r\ncollapse of the Neapolitan army destroyed the hopes of the bravest\r\npatriots; and the only result of the Piedmontese movement was that the\r\ngrasp of Austria closed more tightly on its subject provinces, while the\r\nmartyrs of Italian freedom passed out of the sight of the world, out of the\r\nrange of all human communication, buried for years to come in the silent,\r\nunvisited prison of the North. [329]\r\n\r\n[The French Ultra-Royalists urging attack on Spain.]\r\n\r\nThus the victory of absolutism was completed, and the law was laid down to\r\nEurope that a people seeking its liberties elsewhere than in the grace and\r\nspontaneous generosity of its legitimate sovereign became a fit object of\r\nattack for the armies of the three Great Powers. It will be seen in a later\r\nchapter how Metternich persuaded the Czar to include under the anathema\r\nissued by the Congress of Laibach (May, 1821) [330] the outbreak of the\r\nGreeks, which at this moment began, and how Lord Castlereagh supported the\r\nAustrian Minister in denying to these rebels against the Sultan all right\r\nor claim to the consideration of Europe. Spain was for the present left\r\nunmolested; but the military operations of 1821 prepared the way for a\r\nsimilar crusade against that country by occasioning the downfall of\r\nRichelieu's Ministry, and throwing the government of France entirely into\r\nthe hands of the Ultra-Royalists. All parties in the French Chamber,\r\nwhether they condemned or approved the suppression of Neapolitan liberty,\r\ncensured a policy which had kept France in inaction, and made Austria\r\nsupreme in Italy. The Ultra-Royalists profited by the general discontent to\r\noverthrow the Minister whom they had promised to support (Dec., 1821); and\r\nfrom this time a war with Spain, conducted either by France alone or in\r\ncombination with the three Eastern Powers, became the dearest hope of the\r\nrank and file of the dominant faction. Villèle, their nominal chief,\r\nremained what he had been before, a statesman among fanatics, and desired\r\nto maintain the attitude of observation as long as this should be possible.\r\nA body of troops had been stationed on the southern frontier in 1820 to\r\nprevent all intercourse with the Spanish districts afflicted with the\r\nyellow fever. This epidemic had passed away, but the number of the troops\r\nwas now raised to a hundred thousand. It was, however, the hope of Villèle\r\nthat hostilities might be averted unless the Spaniards should themselves\r\nprovoke a combat, or, by resorting to extreme measures against King\r\nFerdinand, should compel Louis XVIII. to intervene on behalf of his\r\nkinsman. The more violent section of the French Cabinet, represented by\r\nMontmorency, the Foreign Minister, called for an immediate march on Madrid,\r\nor proposed to delay operations only until France should secure the support\r\nof the other Continental Powers.\r\n\r\n[Spain from 1820 to 1822.]\r\n\r\n[Ferdinand plots with the Serviles against the Constitution.]\r\n\r\nThe condition of Spain in the year 1822 gave ample encouragement to those\r\nwho longed to employ the arms of France in the royalist cause. The hopes of\r\npeaceful reform, which for the first few months after the revolution had\r\nbeen shared even by foreign politicians at Madrid, had long vanished. In\r\nthe moment of popular victory Ferdinand had brought the leaders of the\r\nCortes from their prisons and placed them in office. These men showed a\r\ndignified forgetfulness of the injuries which they had suffered. Misfortune\r\nhad calmed their impetuosity, and taught them more of the real condition of\r\nthe Spanish people. They entered upon their task with seriousness and good\r\nfaith, and would have proved the best friends of constitutional monarchy if\r\nFerdinand had had the least intention of co-operating with them loyally.\r\nBut they found themselves encountered from the first by a double enemy. The\r\nclergy, who had overthrown the Constitution six years before, intrigued or\r\nopenly declared against it as soon as it was revived; the more violent of\r\nthe Liberals, with Riego at their head, abandoned themselves to\r\nextravagances like those of the club-orators of Paris in 1791, and did\r\ntheir best to make any peaceable administration impossible. After combating\r\nthese anarchists, or Exaltados, with some success, the Ministry was forced\r\nto call in their aid, when, at the instigation of the Papal Nuncio, the\r\nKing placed his veto upon a law dissolving most of the monasteries [331]\r\n(Oct., 1820). Ferdinand now openly combined with the enemies of the\r\nConstitution, and attempted to transfer the command of the army to one of\r\nhis own agents. The plot failed; the Ministry sent the alarm over the whole\r\ncountry, and Ferdinand stood convicted before his people as a conspirator\r\nagainst the Constitution which he had sworn to defend. The agitation of the\r\nclubs, which the Ministry had hitherto suppressed, broke out anew. A storm\r\nof accusations assailed Ferdinand himself. He was compelled at the end of\r\nthe year 1820 to banish from Madrid most of the persons who had been his\r\nconfidants; and although his dethronement was not yet proposed, he had\r\nalready become, far more than Louis XVI. of France under similar\r\nconditions, the recognised enemy of the revolution, and the suspected\r\npatron of every treason against the nation.\r\n\r\n[The Ministry between the Exaltados and Serviles, 1821.]\r\n\r\n[Attempted coup d'état, July 6, 1822.]\r\n\r\n[Royalists revolt in the north.]\r\n\r\nThe attack of the despotic Courts on Naples in the spring of 1821\r\nheightened the fury of parties in Spain, encouraging the Serviles, or\r\nAbsolutists, in their plots, and forcing the Ministry to yield to the cry\r\nfor more violent measures against the enemies of the Constitution. In the\r\nsouth of Spain the Exaltados gained possession of the principal military\r\nand civil commands, and openly refused obedience to the central\r\nadministration when it attempted to interfere with their action Seville,\r\nCarthagena, and Cadiz acted as if they were independent Republics and even\r\nspoke of separation from Spain. Defied by its own subordinates in the\r\nprovinces, and unable to look to the King for any sincere support, the\r\nmoderate governing party lost all hold upon the nation. In the Cortes\r\nelected in 1822 the Exaltados formed the majority, and Riego was appointed\r\nPresident. Ferdinand now began to concert measures of action with the\r\nFrench Ultra-Royalists. The Serviles, led by priests, and supported by\r\nFrench money, broke into open rebellion in the north. When the session of\r\nthe Cortes ended, the King attempted to overthrow his enemies by military\r\nforce. Three battalions of the Royal Guard, which had been withdrawn from\r\nMadrid, received secret orders to march upon the capital (July 6, 1822),\r\nwhere Ferdinand was expected to place himself at their head. They were,\r\nhowever, met and defeated in the streets by other regiments, and Ferdinand,\r\nvainly attempting to dissociate himself from the action of his partisans,\r\nfound his crown, if not his life, in peril. He wrote to Louis XVIII. that\r\nhe was a prisoner. Though the French King gave nothing more than good\r\ncounsel, the Ultra-Royalists in the French Cabinet and in the army now\r\nstrained every nerve to accelerate a war between the two countries. The\r\nSpanish Absolutists seized the town of Seo d'Urgel, and there set up a\r\nprovisional government. Civil war spread over the northern provinces. The\r\nMinistry, which was now formed of Riego's friends, demanded and obtained\r\nfrom the Cortes dictatorial powers like those which the French Committee of\r\nPublic Safety had wielded in 1793, but with far other result. Spain found\r\nno Danton, no Carnot, at this crisis, when the very highest powers of\r\nintellect and will would have been necessary to arouse and to arm a people\r\nfar less disposed to fight for liberty than the French were in 1793. One\r\nman alone, General Mina, checked and overthrew the rebel leaders of the\r\nnorth with an activity superior to their own. The Government, boastful and\r\nviolent in its measures, effected scarcely anything in the organisation of\r\na national force, or in preparing the means of resistance against those\r\nforeign armies with whose attack the country was now plainly threatened.\r\n\r\n[England and the Congress of 1822.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Congress of Laibach broke up in the spring of 1821. its members\r\ndetermined to renew their meeting in the following year, in order to decide\r\nwhether the Austrian army might then be withdrawn from Naples, and to\r\ndiscuss other questions affecting their common interests. The progress of\r\nthe Greek insurrection and a growing strife between Russia and Turkey had\r\nsince then thrown all Italian difficulties into the shade. The Eastern\r\nquestion stood in the front rank of European politics; next in importance\r\ncame the affairs of Spain. It was certain that these, far more than the\r\noccupation of Naples, would supply the real business of the Congress of\r\n1822. England had a far greater interest in both questions than in the\r\nItalian negotiations of the two previous years. It was felt that the system\r\nof abstention which England had then followed could be pursued no longer,\r\nand that the country must be represented not by some casual and wandering\r\ndiplomatist, but by its leading Minister, Lord Castlereagh. The intentions\r\nof the other Powers in regard to Spain were matter of doubt; it was the\r\nfixed policy of Great Britain to leave the Spanish revolution in Europe to\r\nrun its own course, and to persuade the other Powers to do the same. But\r\nthe difficulties connected with Spain did not stop at the Spanish frontier.\r\nThe South American colonies had now in great part secured their\r\nindependence. They had developed a trade with Great Britain which made it\r\nimpossible for this country to ignore their flag and the decisions of their\r\nlaw courts. The British navigation-laws had already been modified by\r\nParliament in favour of their shipping; and although it was no business of\r\nthe English Government to grant a formal title to communities which had\r\nmade themselves free, the practical recognition of the American States by\r\nthe appointment of diplomatic agents could in several cases not be justly\r\ndelayed. Therefore, without interfering with any colonies which were still\r\nfighting or still negotiating with Spain, the British Minister proposed to\r\ninform the Allied cabinets of the intention of this country to accredit\r\nagents to some of the South American Republics, and to recommend to them\r\nthe adoption of a similar policy.\r\n\r\n[Death of Castlereagh, Aug. 12, 1822.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the tenour of the instructions which, a few weeks before his\r\nexpected departure for the Continent, Castlereagh drew up for his own\r\nguidance, and submitted to the Cabinet and the King. [332] Had he lived to\r\nfulfil the mission with which he was charged, the recognition of the South\r\nAmerican Republics, which adds so bright a ray to the fame of Canning,\r\nwould probably have been the work of the man who, more than any other, is\r\nassociated in popular belief with the traditions of a hated and outworn\r\nsystem of oppression. Two more years of life, two more years of change in\r\nthe relations of England to the Continent, would have given Castlereagh a\r\ndifferent figure in the history both of Greece and of America. No English\r\nstatesman in modern times has been so severely judged. Circumstances, down\r\nto the close of his career, withheld from Castlereagh the opportunities\r\nwhich fell to his successor; ties from which others were free made it hard\r\nfor him to accelerate the breach with the Allies of 1814. Antagonists\r\nshowed Castlereagh no mercy, no justice. The man whom Byron disgraced\r\nhimself by ridiculing after his death possessed in a rich measure the\r\nqualities which, in private life, attract esteem and love. His public life,\r\nif tainted in earlier days by the low political morality of the time, rose\r\nhigh above that of every Continental statesman of similar rank, with the\r\nsingle exception of Stein. The best testimony to his integrity is the\r\nirritation which it caused to Talleyrand. [333] If the consciousness of\r\nlabour unflaggingly pursued in the public cause, and animated on the whole\r\nby a pure and earnest purpose, could have calmed the distress of a breaking\r\nmind, the decline of Castlereagh's days might have been one of peace. His\r\ncountrymen would have recognised that, if blind to the rights of nations,\r\nCastlereagh had set to foreign rulers the example of truth and good faith.\r\nBut the burden of his life was too heavy to bear. Mists of despondency\r\nobscured the outlines of the real world, and struck chill into his heart.\r\nDeath, self-invoked, brought relief to the over-wrought brain, and laid\r\nCastlereagh, with all his cares, in everlasting sleep.\r\n\r\n[Canning Foreign Secretary. Wellington deputed to the Congress, Sept.,\r\n1822.]\r\n\r\n[Congress of Verona, Oct., 1822.]\r\n\r\nThe vacant post was filled by Canning, by far the most gifted of the band\r\nof statesmen who had begun their public life in the school of Pitt.\r\nWellington undertook to represent England at the Congress of 1822, which\r\nwas now about to open at Vienna. His departure was, however, delayed for\r\nseveral weeks, and the preliminary meeting, at which it had been intended\r\nto transact all business not relating to Italy, was almost over before his\r\narrival. Wellington accordingly travelled on to Verona, where Italian\r\naffairs were to be dealt with; and the Italian Conference, which the\r\nBritish Government had not intended to recognise, thus became the real\r\nCongress of 1822. Anxious as Lord Castlereagh had been on the question of\r\nforeign interference with Spain, he hardly understood the imminence of the\r\ndanger. In passing through Paris, Wellington learnt for the first time that\r\na French or European invasion of Spain would be the foremost object of\r\ndiscussion among the Powers; and on reaching Verona he made the unwelcome\r\ndiscovery that the Czar was bent upon sending a Russian army to take part,\r\nas the mandatary of Europe, in overthrowing the Spanish Constitution.\r\nAlexander's desire was to obtain a joint declaration from the Congress like\r\nthat which had been issued against Naples by the three Courts at Troppau,\r\nbut one even more formidable, since France might be expected in the present\r\ncase to give its concurrence, which had been withheld before. France indeed\r\noccupied, according to the absolutist theory of the day, the same position\r\nin regard to a Jacobin Spain as Austria in regard to a Jacobin Naples, and\r\nmight perhaps claim to play the leading military part in the crusade of\r\nrepression. But the work was likely to be a much more difficult one than\r\nthat of 1821. The French troops, said the Czar, were not trustworthy; and\r\nthere was a party in France which might take advantage of the war to\r\nproclaim the second Napoleon or the Republic. King Louis XVIII. could not\r\ntherefore be allowed to grapple with Spain alone. It was necessary that the\r\nprincipal force employed by the alliance should be one whose loyalty and\r\nmilitary qualities were above suspicion: the generals who had marched from\r\nMoscow to Paris were not likely to fail beyond the Pyrenees: and a campaign\r\nof the Russian army in Western Europe promised to relieve the Czar of some\r\nof the discontent of his soldiers, who had been turned back after entering\r\nGalicia in the previous year, and who had not been allowed to assist their\r\nfellow-believers in Greece in their struggle against the Sultan. [334]\r\n\r\n[No joint declaration by made by the Congress against Spain.]\r\n\r\nWellington had ascertained, while in Paris, that King Louis XVIII. and\r\nVillèle were determined under no circumstances to give Russian troops a\r\npassage through France. His knowledge of this fact enabled him to speak\r\nwith some confidence to Alexander. It was the earnest desire of the English\r\nGovernment to avert war, and its first object was therefore to prevent the\r\nCongress, as a body, from sending an ultimatum to Spain. If all the Powers\r\nunited in a declaration like that of Troppau, war was inevitable; if France\r\nwere left to settle its own disputes with its neighbour, English mediation\r\nmight possibly preserve peace. The statement of Wellington, that England\r\nwould rather sever itself from the great alliance than consent to a joint\r\ndeclaration against Spain, had no doubt its effect in preventing such a\r\ndeclaration being proposed; but a still weightier reason against it was the\r\ndirect contradiction between the intentions of the French Government and\r\nthose of the Czar. If the Czar was determined to be the soldier of Europe,\r\nwhile on the other hand King Louis absolutely denied him a passage through\r\nFrance, it was impossible that the Congress should threaten Spain with a\r\ncollective attack. No great expenditure of diplomacy was therefore\r\nnecessary to prevent the summary framing of a decree against Spain like\r\nthat which had been framed against Naples two years before. In the first\r\ndespatches which he sent back to England Wellington expressed his belief\r\nthat the deliberations of the Powers would end in a decision to leave the\r\nSpaniards to themselves.\r\n\r\n[Course of the negotiation against Spain.]\r\n\r\nBut the danger was only averted in appearance. The impulse to war was too\r\nstrong among the French Ultra-Royalists for the Congress to keep silence on\r\nSpanish affairs. Villèle indeed still hoped for peace, and, unlike other\r\nmembers of his Cabinet, he desired that, if war should arise, France should\r\nmaintain entire freedom of action, and enter upon the struggle as an\r\nindependent Power, not as the instrument of the European concert. This did\r\nnot prevent him, however, from desiring to ascertain what assistance would\r\nbe forthcoming, if France should be hard pressed by its enemy. Instructions\r\nwere given to the French envoys at Verona to sound the Allies on this\r\nquestion. [335] It was out of the inquiry so suggested that a negotiation\r\nsprang which virtually combined all Europe against Spain. The envoy\r\nMontmorency, acting in the spirit of the war party, demanded of all the\r\nPowers whether, in the event of France withdrawing its ambassador from\r\nMadrid, they would do the same, and whether, in case of war, France would\r\nreceive their moral and material support. Wellington in his reply protested\r\nagainst the framing of hypothetical cases; the other envoys answered\r\nMontmorency's questions in the affirmative. The next step was taken by\r\nMetternich, who urged that certain definite acts of the Spanish people or\r\nGovernment ought to be specified as rendering war obligatory on France and\r\nits allies, and also that, with a view of strengthening the Royalist party\r\nin Spain, notes ought to be presented by all the ambassadors at Madrid,\r\ndemanding a change in the Constitution. This proposal was in its turn\r\nsubmitted to Wellington and rejected by him. It was accepted by the other\r\nplenipotentiaries, and the acts of the Spanish people were specified on\r\nwhich war should necessarily follow. These were, the commission of any act\r\nof violence against a member of the royal family, the deposition of the\r\nKing, or an attempt to change the dynasty. A secret clause was added to the\r\nsecond part of the agreement, to the effect that if the Spanish Government\r\nmade no satisfactory answer to the notes requiring a change in the\r\nConstitution, all the ambassadors should be immediately withdrawn. A draft\r\nof the notes to be presented was sketched; and Montmorency, who thought\r\nthat he had probably gone too far in his stipulations, returned to Paris to\r\nsubmit the drafts to the King before handing them over to the ambassadors\r\nat Paris for transmission to Madrid.\r\n\r\n[Villèle and Montmorency.]\r\n\r\n[Speech of Louis XVIII., Jan. 27, 1823.]\r\n\r\nIt was with great dissatisfaction that Villèle saw how his colleague had\r\ncommitted France to the direction of the three Eastern Powers. There was no\r\nlikelihood that the Spanish Government would make the least concession of\r\nthe kind required, and in that case France stood pledged, if the action of\r\nMontmorency was ratified, to withdraw its ambassador from Madrid at once.\r\nVillèle accordingly addressed himself to the ambassadors at Paris, asking\r\nthat the despatch of the notes might be postponed. No notice was taken of\r\nhis request: the notes were despatched forthwith. Roused by this slight,\r\nVillèle appealed to the King not to submit to the dictation of foreign\r\nCourts. Louis XVIII. declared in his favour against all the rest of the\r\nCabinet, and Montmorency had to retire from office. But the decision of the\r\nKing meant that he disapproved of the negotiations of Verona as shackling\r\nthe movements of France, not that he had freed himself from the influence\r\nof the war-party. Chateaubriand, the most reckless agitator for\r\nhostilities, was appointed Foreign Minister. The mediation of Great Britain\r\nwas rejected; [336] and in his speech at the opening of the Chambers of\r\n1823, King Louis himself virtually published the declaration of war.\r\n\r\n[England in 1823.]\r\n\r\n[French invasion of Spain, April, 1823.]\r\n\r\nThe ambassadors of the three Eastern Courts had already presented their\r\nnotes at Madrid demanding a change in the Constitution; and, after\r\nreceiving a high-spirited answer from the Ministers, they had quitted the\r\ncountry. Canning, while using every diplomatic effort to prevent an unjust\r\nwar, had made it clear to the Spaniards that England could not render them\r\narmed assistance. The reasons against such an intervention were indeed\r\noverwhelming. Russia, Austria, and Prussia would have taken the field\r\nrather than have permitted the Spanish Constitution to triumph; and\r\nalthough, if leagued with Spain in a really national defence like that of\r\n1808, Great Britain might perhaps have protected the Peninsula against all\r\nthe Powers of Europe combined, it was far otherwise when the cause at stake\r\nwas one to which a majority of the Spanish nation had shown itself to be\r\nindifferent, and against which the northern provinces had actually taken up\r\narms. The Government and the Cortes were therefore left to defend\r\nthemselves as best they could against their enemies. They displayed their\r\nweakness by enacting laws of extreme severity against deserters, and by\r\nretiring, along with the recalcitrant King, from Madrid to Seville. On the\r\n7th of April the French troops, led by the Duke of Angoulême, crossed the\r\nfrontier. The priests and a great part of the peasantry welcomed them as\r\ndeliverers: the forces opposed to them fell back without striking a blow.\r\nAs the invader advanced towards the capital, gangs of royalists, often led\r\nby monks, spread such terror and devastation over the northern provinces\r\nthat the presence of foreign troops became the only safeguard for the\r\npeaceable inhabitants. [337] Madrid itself was threatened by the corps of a\r\nfreebooter named Bessières. The commandant sent his surrender to the French\r\nwhile they were still at some distance, begging them to advance as quickly\r\nas possible in order to save the city from pillage. The message had\r\nscarcely been sent when Bessières and his bandits appeared in the suburbs.\r\nThe governor drove them back, and kept the royalist mob within the city at\r\nbay for four days more. On the 23rd of May the advance-guard of the French\r\narmy entered the capital.\r\n\r\n[Angoulême and the Regency, and the ambassadors.]\r\n\r\nIt had been the desire of King Louis XVIII. and Angoulême to save Spain\r\nfrom the violence of royalist and priestly fanaticism. On reaching Madrid,\r\nAngoulême intended to appoint a provisional, government himself; he was,\r\nhowever, compelled by orders from Paris to leave the election in the hands\r\nof the Council of Castille, and a Regency came into power whose first acts\r\nshowed in what spirit the victory of the French was to be used. Edicts were\r\nissued declaring all the acts of the Cortes affecting the monastic orders\r\nto be null and void, dismissing all officials appointed since March 7,\r\n1820, and subjecting to examination those who, then being in office, had\r\nnot resigned their posts. [338] The arrival of the ambassadors of the three\r\nEastern Powers encouraged the Regency in their antagonism to the French\r\ncommander. It was believed that the Cabinet of Paris was unwilling to\r\nrestore King Ferdinand as an absolute monarch, and intended to obtain from\r\nhim the grant of institutions resembling those of the French Charta. Any\r\nsuch limitation of absolute power was, however, an object of horror to the\r\nthree despotic Courts. Their ambassadors formed themselves into a council\r\nwith the express object of resisting the supposed policy of Angoulême. The\r\nRegency grew bolder, and gave the signal for general retribution upon the\r\nLiberals by publishing an order depriving all persons who had served in the\r\nvoluntary militia since March, 1820, of their offices, pensions, and\r\ntitles. The work inaugurated in the capital was carried much further in the\r\nprovinces. The friends of the Constitution, and even soldiers who were\r\nprotected by their capitulation with the French, were thrown into prison by\r\nthe new local authorities. The violence of the reaction reached such a\r\nheight that Angoulême, now on the march to Cadiz, was compelled to publish\r\nan ordinance forbidding arrests to be made without the consent of a French\r\ncommanding officer, and ordering his generals to release the persons who\r\nhad been arbitrarily imprisoned. The council of ambassadors, blind in their\r\njealousy of France to the danger of an uncontrolled restoration, drew up a\r\nprotest against his ordinance, and desired that the officers of the Regency\r\nshould be left to work their will.\r\n\r\n[The Cortes at Cadiz.]\r\n\r\n[Ferdinand liberated, Oct. 1.]\r\n\r\nAfter spending some weeks in idle debates at Seville, the Cortes had been\r\ncompelled by the appearance of the French on the Sierra Morena to retire to\r\nCadiz. As King Ferdinand refused to accompany them, he was declared\r\ntemporarily insane, and forced to make the journey (June 12). Angoulême,\r\nfollowing the French vanguard after a considerable interval, appeared\r\nbefore Cadiz in August, and sent a note to King Ferdinand, recommending him\r\nto publish an amnesty, and to promise the restoration of the mediæval\r\nCortes. It was hoped that the terms suggested in this note might be\r\naccepted by the Government in Cadiz as a basis of peace, and so render an\r\nattack upon the city unnecessary. The Ministry, however, returned a defiant\r\nanswer in the King's name. The siege of Cadiz accordingly began in earnest.\r\nOn the 30th of August the fort of the Trocadero was stormed; three weeks\r\nlater the city was bombarded. In reply to all proposals for negotiation\r\nAngoulême stated that he could only treat when King Ferdinand was within\r\nhis own lines. There was not the least hope of prolonging the defence of\r\nCadiz with success, for the combat was dying out even in those few\r\ndistricts of Spain where the constitutional troops had fought with energy.\r\nFerdinand himself pretended that he bore no grudge against his Ministers,\r\nand that the Liberals had nothing to fear from his release. On the 30th of\r\nSeptember he signed, as if with great satisfaction, an absolute and\r\nuniversal amnesty. [339] On the following day he was conveyed with his\r\nfamily across the bay to Angoulême's head-quarters.\r\n\r\n[Violence of the Restoration.]\r\n\r\nThe war was over: the real results of the French invasion now came into\r\nsight. Ferdinand had not been twelve hours in the French camp when,\r\nsurrounded by monks and royalist desperadoes, he published a proclamation\r\ninvalidating every act of the constitutional Government of the last three\r\nyears, on the ground that his sanction had been given under constraint. The\r\nsame proclamation ratified the acts of the Regency of Madrid. As the\r\nRegency of Madrid had declared all persons concerned in the removal of the\r\nKing to Cadiz to be liable to the penalties of high treason, Ferdinand had\r\nin fact ratified a sentence of death against several of the men from whom\r\nhe had just parted in friendship. [340] Many of these victims of the King's\r\nperfidy were sent into safety by the French. But Angoulême was powerless to\r\ninfluence Ferdinand's policy and conduct. Don Saez, the King's confessor,\r\nwas made First Secretary of State. On the 4th of October an edict was\r\nissued banishing for ever from Madrid, and from the country fifty miles\r\nround it, every person who during the last three years had sat in the\r\nCortes, or who had been a Minister, counsellor of State, judge, commander,\r\nofficial in any public office, magistrate, or officer in the so-called\r\nvoluntary militia. It was ordered that throughout Spain a solemn service\r\nshould be celebrated in expiation of the insults offered to the Holy\r\nSacrament; that missions should be sent over the land to combat the\r\npernicious and heretical doctrines associated with the late outbreak, and\r\nthat the bishops should relegate to monasteries of the strictest observance\r\nthe priests who had acted as the agents of an impious faction. [341] Thus\r\nthe war of revenge was openly declared against the defeated party. It was\r\nin vain that Angoulême indignantly reproached the King, and that the\r\nambassadors of the three Eastern Courts pressed him to draw up at least\r\nsome kind of amnesty. Ferdinand travelled slowly towards Madrid, saying\r\nthat he could take no such step until he reached the capital. On the 7th of\r\nNovember, Riego was hanged. Thousands of persons were thrown into prison,\r\nor compelled to fly from the country. Except where order was preserved by\r\nthe French, life and property were at the mercy of royalist mobs and the\r\npriests who led them; and although the influence of the Russian statesman\r\nPozzo di Borgo at length brought a respectable Ministry into office, this\r\nonly roused the fury of the clerical party, and led to a cry for the\r\ndeposition of the King, and for the elevation of his more fanatical\r\nbrother, Don Carlos, to the throne. Military commissions were instituted at\r\nthe beginning of 1824 for the trial of accused persons, and a pretended\r\namnesty, published six months later, included in its fifteen classes of\r\nexception the participators in almost every act of the revolution.\r\nOrdinance followed upon ordinance, multiplying the acts punishable with\r\ndeath, and exterminating the literature which was believed to be the source\r\nof all religious and social heterodoxy. Every movement of life was watched\r\nby the police; every expression of political opinion was made high treason.\r\nYoung men were shot for being freemasons; women were sent to prison for ten\r\nyears for possessing a portrait of Riego. The relation of the restored\r\nGovernment to its subjects was in fact that which belonged to a state of\r\ncivil war. Insurrections arose among the fanatics who were now taking the\r\nname of the Carlist or Apostolic party, as well as among a despairing\r\nremnant of the Constitutionalists. After a feeble outbreak of the latter at\r\nTarifa, a hundred and twelve persons were put to death by the military\r\ncommissions within eighteen days. [342] It was not until the summer of 1825\r\nthat the jurisdiction of these tribunals and the Reign of Terror ended.\r\n\r\n[England prohibits the conquest of Spanish colonies by France or its\r\nallies.]\r\n\r\n[England recognises the independence of the colonies. 1824-5.]\r\n\r\nFrance had won a cheap and inglorious victory. The three Eastern Courts had\r\nseen their principle of absolutism triumph at the cost of everything that\r\nmakes government morally better than anarchy. One consolation remained for\r\nthose who felt that there was little hope for freedom on the Continent of\r\nEurope. The crusade against Spanish liberty had put an end for ever to the\r\npossibility of a joint conquest of Spanish America in the interest of\r\ndespotism. The attitude of England was no longer what it had been in 1818.\r\nWhen the Czar had proposed at the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle that the\r\nallied monarchs should suppress the republican principle beyond the seas,\r\nCastlereagh had only stated that England could bear no part in such an\r\nenterprise; he had not said that England would effectually prevent others\r\nfrom attempting it. This was the resolution by which Canning, isolated and\r\nbaffled by the conspiracy of Verona, proved that England could still do\r\nsomething to protect its own interest and the interests of mankind against\r\na league of autocrats. There is indeed little doubt that the independence\r\nof the Spanish colonies would have been recognised by Great Britain soon\r\nafter the war of 1823, whoever might have been our Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, but this recognition was a different matter in the hands of\r\nCanning from what it would have been in the hands of his predecessor. The\r\ncontrast between the two men was one of spirit rather than of avowed rules\r\nof action. Where Castlereagh offered apologies to the Continental\r\nsovereigns, Canning uttered defiance [343] The treaties of 1815, which\r\nconnected England so closely with the foreign courts, were no work of his;\r\nthough he sought not to repudiate them, he delighted to show that in spite\r\nof them England has still its own policy, its own sympathies, its own\r\ntraditions. In face of the council of kings and its assumption of universal\r\njurisdiction, he publicly described himself as an enthusiast for the\r\nindependence of nations. If others saw little evidence that France intended\r\nto recompense itself for its services to Ferdinand by appropriating some of\r\nhis rebellious colonies, Canning was quick to lay hold of every suspicious\r\ncircumstance. At the beginning of the war of 1823 he gave a formal warning\r\nto the ambassador of Louis XVIII. that France would not be permitted to\r\nbring any of these provinces under its dominion, whether by conquest or\r\ncession. [344] When the war was over, he rejected the invitation of\r\nFerdinand's Government to take part in a conference at Paris, where the\r\naffairs of South America were to be laid before the Allied Powers. [345]\r\nWhat these Powers might or might not think on the subject of America was\r\nnow a matter of indifference, for the policy of England was fixed, and it\r\nwas useless to debate upon a conclusion that could not be altered. British\r\nconsular agents were appointed in most of the colonies before the close of\r\nthe year 1823; and after some interval the independence of Buenos Ayres,\r\nColombia, and Mexico were formally recognised by the conclusion of\r\ncommercial treaties. \"I called the New World into existence,\" cried\r\nCanning, when reproached with permitting the French occupation of Spain,\r\n\"in order to redress the balance of the Old.\" The boast, famous in our\r\nParliamentary history, has left an erroneous impression of the part really\r\nplayed by Canning at this crisis. He did not call the New World into\r\nexistence; he did not even assist it in winning independence, as France had\r\nassisted the United States fifty years before; but when this independence\r\nhad been won, he threw over it the aegis of Great Britain, declaring that\r\nno other European Power should reimpose the yoke which Spain had not been\r\nable to maintain.\r\n\r\n[Affairs in Portugal.]\r\n\r\n[Constitution granted by Pedro, May, 1826.]\r\n\r\nThe overthrow of the Spanish Constitution by foreign arms led to a series\r\nof events in Portugal which forced England to a more direct intervention in\r\nthe Peninsula than had yet been necessary, and heightened the conflict that\r\nhad sprung up between its policy and that of Continental absolutism. The\r\nsame parties and the same passions, political and religious, existed in\r\nPortugal as in Spain, and the enemies of the Constitution found the same\r\nsupport at foreign Courts. The King of Portugal, John VI., was a weak but\r\nnot ill-meaning man; his wife, who was a sister of Ferdinand of Spain, and\r\nhis son Don Miguel were the chiefs of the conspiracy against the Cortes. In\r\nJune, 1823, a military revolt, arranged by Miguel, brought the existing\r\nform of government to an end: the King promised, however, when dissolving\r\nthe Cortes, that a Constitution should be bestowed by himself upon\r\nPortugal; and he seems to have intended to keep his word. The ambassadors\r\nof France and Austria were, however, busy in throwing hindrances in the\r\nway, and Don Miguel prepared to use violence to prevent his father from\r\nmaking any concession to the Liberals. King John, in fear for his life,\r\napplied to England for troops; Canning declined to land soldiers at Lisbon,\r\nbut sent a squadron, with orders to give the King protection. The winter of\r\n1823 was passed in intrigues; in May, 1824, Miguel arrested the Ministers\r\nand surrounded the King's palace with troops. After several days of\r\nconfusion King John made his escape to the British ships, and Miguel, who\r\nwas alternately cowardly and audacious, then made his submission, and was\r\nordered to leave the country. King John died in the spring of 1826 without\r\nhaving granted a Constitution. Pedro, his eldest son, had already been made\r\nEmperor of Brazil; and, as it was impossible that Portugal and Brazil could\r\nagain be united, it was arranged that Pedro's daughter, when of sufficient\r\nage, should marry her uncle Miguel, and so save Portugal from the danger of\r\na contested succession. Before renouncing the crown of Portugal, Pedro\r\ngranted a Constitution to that country. A Regency had already been\r\nappointed by King John, in which neither the Queen-dowager nor Miguel was\r\nincluded.\r\n\r\n[Desertion of Portuguese soldiery, 1826.]\r\n\r\n[Spain permits the deserters to attack Portugal.]\r\n\r\n[Canning sends troops to Lisbon, Dec., 1826.]\r\n\r\nMiguel had gone to Vienna. Although a sort of Caliban in character and\r\nunderstanding, this Prince met with the welcome due to a kinsman of the\r\nImperial house, and to a representative of the good cause of absolutism. He\r\nwas received by Metternich with great interest, and his fortunes were taken\r\nunder the protection of the Austrian Court. In due time, it was hoped this\r\nsavage and ignorant churl would do yeoman's service to Austrian principles\r\nin the Peninsula. But the Regency and the new Constitution of Portugal had\r\nnot to wait for the tardy operation of Metternich's covert hostility. The\r\nsoldiery who had risen at Miguel's bidding in 1823 now proclaimed him King,\r\nand deserted to Spanish soil. Within the Spanish frontier they were\r\nreceived by Ferdinand's representatives with open arms. The demands made by\r\nthe Portuguese ambassador at Madrid for their dispersion and for the\r\nsurrender of their weapons were evaded. The cause of these armed bands on\r\nthe frontier became the cause of the Clerical and Ultra-Royalist party over\r\nall Europe. Money was sent to them from France and Austria. They were\r\njoined by troops of Spanish Carlists or Apostolicals; they were fed,\r\nclothed, and organised, if not by the Spanish Government itself, at least\r\nby those over whose action the Spanish Government exercised control. [346]\r\nThus raised to considerable military strength, they made incursions into\r\nPortugal, and at last attempted a regular invasion. The Regency of Lisbon,\r\njustly treating these outrages as the act of the Spanish Government, and\r\nappealing to the treaties which bound Great Britain to defend Portugal\r\nagainst foreign attack, demanded the assistance of this country. More was\r\ninvolved in the action taken by Canning than a possible contest with Spain;\r\nthe seriousness of the danger lay in the fact that Spain was still occupied\r\nby French armies, and that a war with Spain might, and probably would,\r\ninvolve a war with France, if not with other Continental Powers. But the\r\nEnglish Ministry waited only for the confirmation of the alleged facts by\r\ntheir own ambassador. The treaty-rights of Portugal were undoubted; the\r\ntemper of the English Parliament and nation, strained to the utmost by the\r\nevents of the last three years, was such that a war against Ferdinand and\r\nagainst the destroyers of Spanish liberty would have caused more rejoicing\r\nthan alarm. Nine days after the formal demand of the Portuguese arrived,\r\nfour days after their complaint was substantiated by the report of our\r\nambassador, Canning announced to the House of Commons that British troops\r\nwere actually on the way to Lisbon. In words that alarmed many of his own\r\nparty, and roused the bitter indignation of every Continental Court,\r\nCanning warned those whose acts threatened to force England into war, that\r\nthe war, if war arose, would be a war of opinion, and that England, however\r\nearnestly she might endeavour to avoid it, could not avoid seeing ranked\r\nunder her banner all the restless and discontented of any nation with which\r\nshe might come into conflict. As for the Portuguese Constitution which\r\nformed the real object of the Spanish attack, it had not, Canning said,\r\nbeen given at the instance of Great Britain, but he prayed that Heaven\r\nmight prosper it. It was impossible to doubt that a Minister who spoke\r\nthus, and who, even under expressions of regret, hinted at any alliance\r\nwith the revolutionary elements in France and Spain, was formidably in\r\nearnest. The words and the action of Canning produced the effect which he\r\ndesired. The Government of Ferdinand discovered the means of checking the\r\nactivity of the Apostolicals: the presence of the British troops at Lisbon\r\nenabled the Portuguese Regency to throw all its forces upon the invaders\r\nand to drive them from the country. They were disbanded when they\r\nre-crossed the Spanish frontier; the French Court loudly condemned their\r\nimmoral enterprise; and the Constitution of Portugal seemed, at least for\r\nthe moment, to have triumphed over its open and its secret enemies.\r\n\r\n[The policy of Canning.]\r\n\r\nThe tone of the English Government had indeed changed since the time when\r\nMetternich could express a public hope that the three Eastern Powers would\r\nhave the approval of this country in their attack upon the Constitution of\r\nNaples. In 1820 such a profession might perhaps have passed for a mistake;\r\nin 1826 it would have been a palpable absurdity. Both in England and on the\r\nContinent it was felt that the difference between the earlier and the later\r\nspirit of our policy was summed up in the contrast between Canning and\r\nCastlereagh. It has become an article of historical faith that\r\nCastlereagh's melancholy death brought one period of our foreign policy to\r\na close and inaugurated another: it has been said that Canning liberated\r\nEngland from its Continental connexions; it has even been claimed for him\r\nthat he performed for Europe no less a task than the dissolution of the\r\nHoly Alliance. [347] The figure of Canning is indeed one that will for ever\r\nfill a great space in European history; and the more that is known of the\r\nopposition which he encountered both from his sovereign and from his great\r\nrival Wellington, the greater must be our admiration for his clear, strong\r\nmind, and for the conquering force of his character. But the legend which\r\nrepresents English policy as taking an absolutely new departure in 1822\r\ndoes not correspond to the truth of history. Canning was a member of the\r\nCabinet from 1816 to 1820; it is a poor compliment to him to suppose that\r\nhe either exercised no influence upon his colleagues or acquiesced in a\r\npolicy of which he disapproved; and the history of the Congress of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle proves that his counsels had even at that time gained the\r\nascendant. The admission made by Castlereagh in 1820, after Canning had\r\nleft the Cabinet, that Austria, as a neighbouring and endangered State, had\r\na right to suppress the revolutionary constitution of Naples, would\r\nprobably not have gained Canning's assent; in all other points, the action\r\nof our Government at Troppau and Laibach might have been his own. Canning\r\nloved to speak of his system as one of neutrality, and of non-interference\r\nin that struggle between the principles of despotism and of democracy which\r\nseemed to be spreading over Europe. He avowed his sympathy for Spain as the\r\nobject of an unjust and unprovoked war, but he most solemnly warned the\r\nSpaniards not to expect English assistance. He prayed that the Constitution\r\nof Portugal might prosper, but he expressly disclaimed all connection with\r\nits origin, and defended Portugal not because it was a Constitutional\r\nState, but because England was bound by treaties to defend it against\r\nforeign invasion. The arguments against intervention on behalf of Spain\r\nwhich Canning addressed to the English sympathisers with that country might\r\nhave been uttered by Castlereagh; the denial of the right of foreign Powers\r\nto attack the Spanish Constitution, with which Castlereagh headed his own\r\ninstructions for Verona, might have been written by Canning.\r\n\r\n[Canning and the European concert.]\r\n\r\nThe statements that Canning withdrew England from the Continental system,\r\nand that he dissolved the Holy Alliance, cannot be accepted without large\r\ncorrection. The general relations existing between the Great Powers were\r\nbased, not on the ridiculous and obsolete treaty of Holy Alliance, but on\r\nthe Acts which were signed at the Conference of Aix-la-Chapelle. The first\r\nof these was the secret Quadruple Treaty which bound England and the three\r\nEastern Powers to attack France in case a revolution in that country should\r\nendanger the peace of Europe; the second was the general declaration of all\r\nthe five Powers that they would act in amity and take counsel with one\r\nanother. From the first of these alliances Canning certainly did not\r\nwithdraw England. He would perhaps have done so in 1823 if the Quadruple\r\nTreaty had bound England to maintain the House of Bourbon on the French\r\nthrone; but it had been expressly stated that the deposition of the\r\nBourbons would not necessarily and in itself be considered by England as\r\nendangering the peace of Europe. This treaty remained in full force up to\r\nCanning's death; and if a revolutionary army had marched from Paris upon\r\nAntwerp, he would certainly have claimed the assistance of the three\r\nEastern Powers. With respect to the general concert of Europe, established\r\nor confirmed by the declaration of Aix-la-Chapelle, this had always been\r\none of varying extent and solidity. Both France and England had held\r\nthemselves aloof at Troppau. The federative action was strongest and most\r\nmischievous not before but after the death of Castlereagh, and in the\r\nperiod that followed the Congress of Verona; for though the war against\r\nSpain was conducted by France alone, the three Eastern Powers had virtually\r\nmade themselves responsible for the success of the enterprise, and it was\r\nthe influence of their ambassadors at Paris and Madrid which prevented any\r\nrestrictions from being imposed upon Ferdinand's restored sovereignty.\r\n\r\nCanning is invested with a spurious glory when it is said that his action\r\nin Spain and in Portugal broke up the league of the Continental Courts.\r\nCanning indeed shaped the policy of our own country with equal independence\r\nand wisdom, but the political centre of Europe was at this time not London\r\nbut Vienna. The keystone of the European fabric was the union of Austria\r\nand Russia, and this union was endangered, not by anything that could take\r\nplace in the Spanish Peninsula, but by the conflicting interests of these\r\ntwo great States in regard to the Ottoman Empire. From the moment when the\r\nTreaty of Paris was signed, every Austrian politician fixed his gaze upon\r\nthe roads leading to the Lower Danube, and anxiously noted the signs of\r\ncoming war, or of continued peace, between Russia and the Porte. [348] It\r\nwas the triumph of Metternich to have diverted the Czar's thoughts during\r\nthe succeeding years from his grievances against Turkey, and to have\r\nbaffled the Russian diplomatists and generals who, like Capodistrias,\r\nsought to spur on their master to enterprises of Eastern conquest. At the\r\nCongress of Verona the shifting and incoherent manoeuvres of Austrian\r\nstatecraft can indeed only be understood on the supposition that Metternich\r\nwas thinking all the time less of Spain than of Turkey, and struggling at\r\nwhatever cost to maintain that personal influence over Alexander which had\r\nhitherto prevented the outbreak of war in the East. But the antagonism so\r\nlong suppressed broke out at last. The progress of the Greek insurrection\r\nbrought Austria and Russia not indeed into war, but into the most\r\nembittered hostility with one another. It was on this rock that the\r\nungainly craft which men called the Holy Alliance at length struck and went\r\nto pieces. Canning played his part well in the question of the East, but he\r\ndid not create this question. There were forces at work which, without his\r\nintervention, would probably have made an end of the despotic amities of\r\n1815. It is not necessary to the title of a great statesman that he should\r\nhave called into being the elements which make a new political order\r\npossible; it is sufficient praise that he should have known how to turn\r\nthem to account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nCondition of Greece: its Races and Institutions--The Greek Church--Communal\r\nSystem--The Ægæan Islands--The Phanariots--Greek Intellectual Revival;\r\nKoraes--Beginning of Greek National Movement; Contact of Greece with the\r\nFrench Revolution and Napoleon--The Hetæria Philike--Hypsilanti's Attempt\r\nin the Danubian Provinces; its Failure--Revolt of the Morea: Massacres:\r\nExecution of Gregorius, and Terrorism at Constantinople--Attitude of\r\nRussia, Austria, and England--Extension of the Revolt: Affairs at\r\nHydra--The Greek Leaders--Fall of Tripolitza--The Massacre of Chios--\r\nFailure of the Turks in the Campaign of 1822--Dissensions of the\r\nGreeks--Mahmud calls upon Mehemet Ali for Aid--Ibrahim conquers Crete and\r\ninvades the Morea--Siege of Missolonghi--Philhellenism in Europe--Russian\r\nProposal for Intervention--Conspiracies in Russia: Death of Alexander:\r\nAccession of Nicholas--Military Insurrection at St. Petersburg--\r\nAnglo-Russian Protocol--Treaty between England, Russia, and France--Death\r\nof Canning--Navarino--War between Russia and Turkey--Campaigns of 1828 and\r\n1829--Treaty of Adrianople--Capodistrias President of Greece--Leopold\r\naccepts and then declines the Greek Crown--Murder of Capodistrias--Otho,\r\nKing of Greece.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Greece in the Napoleonic age.]\r\n\r\nOf the Christian races which at the beginning of the third decade of this\r\ncentury peopled the European provinces of the Ottoman Empire, the Greek was\r\nthat which had been least visibly affected by the political and military\r\nevents of the Napoleonic age. Servia, after a long struggle, had in the\r\nyear 1817 gained local autonomy under its own princes, although Turkish\r\ntroops still garrisoned its fortresses, and the sovereignty of the Sultan\r\nwas acknowledged by the payment of tribute. The Romanic districts,\r\nWallachia and Moldavia, which, in the famous interview of Tilsit, Napoleon\r\nhad bidden the Czar to make his own, were restored by Russia to the Porte\r\nin the Treaty of Bucharest in 1812, but under conditions which virtually\r\nestablished a Russian protectorate. Greece, with the exception of the\r\nIonian Islands, had neither been the scene of any military operations, nor\r\nformed the subject of any treaty. Yet the age of the French Revolution and\r\nof the Napoleonic wars had silently wrought in the Greek nation the last of\r\na great series of changes which fitted it to take its place among the free\r\npeoples of Europe. The signs were there from which those who could read the\r\nfuture might have gathered that the political resurrection of Greece was\r\nnear at hand. There were some who, with equal insight and patriotism,\r\nsought during this period to lay the intellectual foundation for that\r\nnational independence which they foresaw that their children would win with\r\nthe sword.\r\n\r\n[Greece in the eighteenth century.]\r\n\r\nThe forward movement of the Greek nation may be said, in general terms, to\r\nhave become visible during the first half of the eighteenth century.\r\nSerfage had then disappeared; the peasant was either a free-holder, or a\r\nfarmer paying a rent in kind for his land. In the gradual and unobserved\r\nemancipation of the labouring class the first condition of national revival\r\nhad already been fulfilled. The peasantry had been formed which, when the\r\nconflict with the Turk broke out, bore the brunt of the long struggle. In\r\ncomparison with the Prussian serf, the Greek cultivator at the beginning of\r\nthe eighteenth century was an independent man: in comparison with the\r\nEnglish labourer, he was well fed and well housed. The evils to which the\r\nGreek population was exposed, wherever Greeks and Turks lived together,\r\nwere those which brutalised or degraded the Christian races in every\r\nOttoman province. There was no redress for injury inflicted by a Mohammedan\r\nofficial or neighbour. If a wealthy Turk murdered a Greek in the fields,\r\nburnt down his house, and outraged his family, there was no court where the\r\noffender could be brought to justice. The term by which the Turk described\r\nhis Christian neighbour was \"our rayah,\" that is, \"our subject.\" A\r\nMohammedan landowner might terrorise the entire population around him,\r\ncarry off the women, flog and imprison the men, and yet feel that he had\r\ncommitted no offence against the law; for no law existed but the Koran, and\r\nno Turkish court of justice but that of the Kadi, where the complaint of\r\nthe Christian passed for nothing.\r\n\r\nThis was the monstrous relation that existed between the dominant and the\r\nsubject nationalities, not in Greece only, but in every part of the Ottoman\r\nEmpire where Mohammedans and Christians inhabited the same districts. The\r\nsecond great and general evil was the extortion practised by the\r\ntax-gatherers, and this fell upon the poorer Mohammedans equally with the\r\nChristians, except in regard to the poll-tax, or haratsch, the badge of\r\nservitude, which was levied on Christians alone. All land paid tithe to the\r\nState; and until the tax-gatherer had paid his visit it was not permitted\r\nto the peasant to cut the ripe crop. This rule enabled the tax-gatherer,\r\nwhether a Mohammedan or a Christian, to inflict ruin upon those who did not\r\nbribe himself or his masters; for by merely postponing his visit he could\r\ndestroy the value of the harvest. Round this central institution of tyranny\r\nand waste, there gathered, except in the districts protected by municipal\r\nprivileges, every form of corruption natural to a society where the State\r\nheard no appeals, and made no inquiry into the processes employed by those\r\nto whom it sold the taxes. What was possible in the way of extortion was\r\nbest seen in the phenomenon of well-built villages being left tenantless,\r\nand the population of rich districts dying out in a time of peace, without\r\npestilence, without insurrection, without any greater wrong on the part of\r\nthe Sultan's government than that normal indifference which permitted the\r\nexistence of a community to depend upon the moderation or the caprice of\r\nthe individual possessors of force.\r\n\r\n[Origin of modern Greece Byzantine, not classic.]\r\n\r\n[Slavonic and Albanian elements.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the framework, or, as it may be said, the common-law of the mixed\r\nTurkish and Christian society of the Ottoman Empire. On this background we\r\nhave now to trace the social and political features which stood out in\r\nGreek life, which preserved the race from losing its separate nationality,\r\nand which made the ultimate recovery of its independence possible. In the\r\nfirst outburst of sympathy and delight with which every generous heart in\r\nwestern Europe hailed the standard of Hellenic freedom upraised in 1821,\r\nthe twenty centuries which separated the Greece of literature from the\r\nGreece of to-day were strangely forgotten. The imagination went straight\r\nback to Socrates and Leonidas, and pictured in the islander or the hillsman\r\nwho rose against Mahmud II. the counterpart of those glorious beings who\r\ngave to Europe the ideals of intellectual energy, of plastic beauty, and of\r\npoetic truth. The illusion was a happy one, if it excited on behalf of a\r\nbrave people an interest which Servia or Montenegro might have failed to\r\ngain; but it led to a reaction when disappointments came; it gave\r\ninordinate importance to the question of the physical descent of the\r\nGreeks; and it produced a false impression of the causes which had led up\r\nto the war of independence, and of the qualities, the habits, the bonds of\r\nunion, which exercised the greatest power over the nation. These were, to a\r\ngreat extent, unlike anything existing in the ancient world; they had\r\noriginated in Byzantine, not in classic Greece; and where the scenes of old\r\nHellenic history appeared to be repeating themselves, it was due more to\r\nthe continuing influence of the same seas and the same mountains than to\r\nthe survival of any political fragments of the past. The Greek population\r\nhad received a strong Slavonic infusion many centuries before. More\r\nrecently, Albanian settlers had expelled the inhabitants from certain\r\ndistricts both in the mainland and in the Morea. Attica, Boeotia, Corinth,\r\nand Argolis were at the outbreak of the war of independence peopled in the\r\nmain by a race of Albanian descent, who still used, along with some Greek,\r\nthe Albanian language. [349] The sense of a separate nationality was,\r\nhowever, weak among these settlers, who, unlike some small Albanian\r\ncommunities in the west of the Morea, were Christians, not Mohammedans.\r\nNeighbourhood, commerce, identity of religion and similarity of local\r\ninstitutions were turning these Albanians into Greeks; and no community of\r\npure Hellenic descent played a greater part in the national war, or\r\nexhibited more of the maritime energy and daring which we associate\r\npeculiarly with the Hellenic name, than the islanders of Hydra and Spetza,\r\nwho had crossed from the Albanian parts of the Morea and taken possession\r\nof these desert rocks not a hundred years before. The same phenomenon of an\r\nassimilation of Greeks and Albanians was seen in southern Epirus, the\r\nborder-ground between the two races. The Suliotes, Albanian mountaineers,\r\nwhose military exploits form one of the most extraordinary chapters in\r\nhistory, showed signs of Greek influences before the Greek war of\r\nindependence began, and in this war they made no distinction between the\r\nGreek cause and their own. Even the rule of the ferocious Ali Pasha at\r\nJanina had been favourable to the extension of Greek civilisation in\r\nEpirus. Under this Mohammedan tyrant Janina contained more schools than\r\nAthens. The Greek population of the district increased; and in the sense of\r\na common religious antagonism to the Mohammedan, the Greek and the Albanian\r\nChristians in Epirus forgot their difference of race.\r\n\r\n[The Greek Church.]\r\n\r\n[Lower clergy.]\r\n\r\n[The Patriarch an imperial functionary.]\r\n\r\n[The Bishops civil magistrates.]\r\n\r\nThe central element in modern Greek life was the religious profession of\r\nthe Orthodox Eastern Church. Where, as in parts of Crete, the Greek adopted\r\nMohammedanism, all the other elements of his nationality together did not\r\nprevent him from amalgamating with the Turk. The sound and popular forces\r\nof the Church belonged to the lower clergy, who, unlike the priests of the\r\nRoman Church, were married and shared the life of the people. If ignorant\r\nand bigoted, they were nevertheless the real guardians of national spirit;\r\nand if their creed was a superstition rather than a religion, it at least\r\nkept the Greeks in a wholesome antagonism to the superstition of their\r\nmasters. The higher clergy stood in many respects in a different position.\r\nThe Patriarch of Constantinople was a great officer of the Porte. His\r\ndignities and his civil jurisdiction had been restored and even enlarged by\r\nthe Mohammedan conquerors of the Greek Empire, with the express object of\r\nemploying the Church as a means of securing obedience to themselves: and it\r\nwas quite in keeping with the history of this great office that, when the\r\nGreek national insurrection at last broke out, the Patriarch Gregorius IV.\r\nshould have consented, though unwillingly, to launch the curse of the\r\nChurch against it. The Patriarch gained his office by purchase, or through\r\nintrigues at the Divan; he paid an enormous annual backsheesh for it; and\r\nhe was liable to be murdered or deposed as soon as his Mussulman patrons\r\nlost favour with the Sultan, or a higher bid was made for his office by a\r\nrival ecclesiastic. To satisfy the claims of the Palace the Patriarch was\r\ncompelled to be an extortioner himself. The bishoprics in their turn were\r\nsold in his ante-chambers, and the Bishops made up the purchase-money by\r\nfleecing their clergy. But in spite of a deserved reputation for venality,\r\nthe Bishops in Greece exercised very great influence, both as ecclesiastics\r\nand as civil magistrates. Whether their jurisdiction in lawsuits between\r\nChristians arose from the custom of referring disputes to their arbitration\r\nor was expressly granted to them by the Sultan, they virtually displaced in\r\nall Greek communities the court of the Kadi, and afforded the merchant or\r\nthe farmer a tribunal where his own law was administered in his own\r\nlanguage. Even a Mohammedan in dispute with a Christian would sometimes\r\nconsent to bring the matter before the Bishops' Court rather than enforce\r\nhis right to obtain the dilatory and capricious decision of an Ottoman\r\njudge.\r\n\r\n[Communal organisation.]\r\n\r\n[The Morea.]\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Greeks living in the country that now forms the\r\nHellenic Kingdom and in the Ægæan Islands exhibited strong local contrasts.\r\nIt was, however, common to all that, while the Turk held the powers of\r\nState in his hand, the details of local administration in each district\r\nwere left to the inhabitants, the Turk caring nothing about these matters\r\nso long as the due amount of taxes was paid and the due supply of sailors\r\nprovided. The apportionment of taxes among households and villages seems to\r\nhave been the germ of self-government from which several types of municipal\r\norganisation, some of them of great importance in the history of the Greek\r\nnation, developed. In the Paschalik of the Morea the taxes were usually\r\nfarmed by the Voivodes, or Beys, the Turkish governors of the twenty-three\r\nprovinces into which the Morea was divided. But in each village or township\r\nthe inhabitants elected officers called Proestoi, who, besides collecting\r\nthe taxes and managing the affairs of their own communities, met in a\r\ndistrict-assembly, and there determined what share of the district-taxation\r\neach community should bear. One Greek officer, called Primate, and one\r\nMohammedan, called Ayan, were elected to represent the district, and to\r\ntake part in the council of the Pasha of the Morea, who resided at\r\nTripolitza. [350] The Primates exercised considerable power. Created\r\noriginally by the Porte to expedite the collection of the revenue, they\r\nbecame a Greek aristocracy. They were indeed an aristocracy of no very\r\nnoble kind. Agents of a tyrannical master, they shared the vices of the\r\ntyrant and of the slave. Often farmers of the taxes themselves, obsequious\r\nand intriguing in the palace of the Pasha at Tripolitza, grasping and\r\ndespotic in their native districts, they were described as a species of\r\nChristian Turk. But whatever their vices, they saved the Greeks from being\r\nleft without leaders. They formed a class accustomed to act in common,\r\nconversant with details of administration, and especially with the\r\nmachinery for collecting and distributing supplies. It was this financial\r\nexperience of the Primates of the Morea which gave to the rebellion of the\r\nGreeks what little unity of organisation it exhibited in its earliest\r\nstage.\r\n\r\n[Northern Greece. The Armatoli and the Klephts.]\r\n\r\nOn the north of the Gulf of Corinth the features of the communal system\r\nwere less distinct than in the Morea. There was, however, in the\r\nmountain-country of Ætolia and Pindus a rough military organisation which\r\nhad done great service to Greece in keeping alive the national spirit and\r\nhabits of personal independence. The Turks had found a local militia\r\nestablished in this wild region at the time of their conquest, and had not\r\ninterfered with it for some centuries. The Armatoli, or native soldiery,\r\nrecruited from peasants, shepherds, and muleteers, kept Mohammedan\r\ninfluences at a distance, until, in the eighteenth century, the Sultans\r\nmade it a fixed rule of policy to diminish their numbers and to reduce the\r\npower of their captains. Before 1820 the Armatoli had become comparatively\r\nfew and weak; but as they declined, bands of Klephts, or brigands, grew in\r\nimportance; and the mountaineer who was no longer allowed to practise arms\r\nas a guardian of order, enlisted himself among the robbers. Like the\r\nfreebooters of our own northern border, these brigands became the heroes of\r\nsong. Though they plundered the Greek as well as the Mohammedan, the\r\nnational spirit approved their exploits. It was, no doubt, something, that\r\nthe physical energy of the marauder and the habit of encountering danger\r\nshould not be wholly on the side of the Turk and the Albanian. But the\r\ninfluence of the Klephts in sustaining Greek nationality has been\r\noverrated. They had but recently become numerous, and the earlier\r\norganisation of the northern Armatoli was that to which the sound and\r\nvigorous character of the Greek peasantry in these regions, the finest part\r\nof the Greek race on the mainland, was really due. [351]\r\n\r\n[The Ægæan Islands.]\r\n\r\n[Chios.]\r\n\r\nIn the islands of the Ægæan the condition of the Greeks was on the whole\r\nhappy and prosperous. Some of these islands had no Turkish population; in\r\nothers the caprice of a Sultana, the goodwill of the Capitan Pasha who\r\ngoverned the Archipelago, or the judicious offer of a sum of money when\r\nmoney was wanted by the Porte, had so lightened the burden of Ottoman\r\nsovereignty, that the Greek island-community possessed more liberty than\r\nwas to be found in any part of Europe, except Switzerland. The taxes\r\npayable to the central government, including the haratsch or poll-tax\r\nlevied on all Christians, had often been commuted for a fixed sum, which\r\nwas raised without the interposition of the Turkish tax-gatherer. In Hydra,\r\nSpetza, and Psara, the so-called nautical islands, the supremacy of the\r\nTurk was felt only in the obligation to furnish sailors to the Ottoman\r\nnavy, and in the payment of a tribute of about £100 per annum. The\r\ngovernment of these three islands was entirely in the hands of the\r\ninhabitants. In Chios, though a considerable Mussulman population existed\r\nby the side of the Greek, there was every sign of peace and prosperity.\r\nEach island bore its own peculiar social character, and had its municipal\r\ninstitutions of more or less value. The Hydriote was quarrelsome,\r\nturbulent, quick to use the knife, but outspoken, honest in dealing, and an\r\nexcellent sailor. The picture of Chian life, as drawn even by those who\r\nhave judged the Greeks most severely, is one of singular beauty and\r\ninterest; the picture of a self-governing society in which the family\r\ntrained the citizen in its own bosom, and in which, while commerce enriched\r\nall, the industry of the poor within their homes and in their gardens was\r\nrefined by the practice of an art. The skill which gave its value to the\r\nembroidery and to the dyes of Chios was exercised by those who also worked\r\nthe hand-loom and cultivated the mastic and the rose. The taste and the\r\nlabour of man requited nature's gifts of sky, soil, and sea; and in the\r\npursuit of occupations which stimulated, not deadened, the faculties of the\r\nworker, idleness and intemperance were alike unknown. [352] How bright a\r\nscene of industry, when compared with the grime and squalor of the English\r\nfactory-town, where the human and the inanimate machine grind out their\r\nyearly mountains of iron-ware and calico, in order that the employer may\r\nvie with his neighbours in soulless ostentation, and the workman consume\r\nhis millions upon millions in drink.\r\n\r\n[The Greeks have ecclesiastical power in other Turkish provinces.]\r\n\r\nThe territory where the Greeks formed the great majority of the population\r\nincluded, beyond the boundaries of the present Hellenic Kingdom, the\r\nislands adjacent to the coast of Asia Minor, Crete, and the Chalcidic\r\npeninsula in Macedonia. But the activity of the race was not confined\r\nwithin these limits. If the Greek was a subject in his own country, he was\r\nmaster in the lands of some of his neighbours. A Greek might exercise power\r\nover other Christian subjects of the Porte either as an ecclesiastic, or as\r\nthe delegate of the Sultan in certain fixed branches of the administration.\r\nThe authority of the Patriarch of Constantinople was recognised over the\r\nwhole of the European provinces of Turkey, except Servia. The Bishops in\r\nall these provinces were Greeks; the services of the Church were conducted\r\nin the Greek tongue; the revenues of the greater part of the Church-lands,\r\nand the fees of all the ecclesiastical courts, went into Greek pockets. In\r\nthings religious, and in that wide range of civil affairs which in\r\ncommunities belonging to the Eastern Church appertains to the higher\r\nreligious office, the Greeks had in fact regained the ascendancy which they\r\nhad possessed under the Byzantine Empire. The dream of the Churchman was\r\nnot the creation of an independent kingdom of Greece, but the restoration\r\nof the Eastern Empire under Greek supremacy. When it was seen that the Slav\r\nand the Rouman came to the Greek for law, for commercial training, for\r\nreligious teaching, and looked to the Patriarch of Constantinople as the\r\nultimate judge of all disputes, it was natural that the belief should arise\r\nthat, when the Turk passed away, the Greek would step into his place. But\r\nthe influence of the Greeks, great as it appeared to be, did not in reality\r\nreach below the surface, except in Epirus. The bishops were felt to be\r\nforeigners and extortioners. There was no real process of assimilation at\r\nwork, either in Bulgaria or in the Danubian Provinces. The slow and\r\nplodding Bulgarian peasant, too stupid for the Greek to think of him as a\r\nrival, preserved his own unchanging tastes and nationality, sang to his\r\nchildren the songs which he had learnt from his parents, and forgot the\r\nGreek which he had heard in the Church when he re-entered his home. [353]\r\nIn Roumania, the only feeling towards the Greek intruder was one of intense\r\nhatred.\r\n\r\n[The Phanariot officials of the Porte.]\r\n\r\n[Greek Hospodars.]\r\n\r\nFour great offices of the Ottoman Empire were always held by Greeks. These\r\nwere the offices of Dragoman, [354] or Secretary, of the Porte, Dragoman of\r\nthe Fleet, and the governorships, called Hospodariates, of Wallachia and\r\nMoldavia. The varied business of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, the\r\nadministration of its revenues, the conduct of its law-courts, had drawn a\r\nmultitude of pushing and well-educated Greeks to the quarter of\r\nConstantinople called the Phanar, in which the palace of the Patriarch is\r\nsituated. Merchants and professional men inhabited the same district. These\r\nGreeks of the capital, the so-called Phanariots, gradually made their way\r\ninto the Ottoman administration as Turkish energy declined, and the\r\nconquering race found that it could no longer dispense with the weapons of\r\ncalculation and diplomacy. The Treaty of Carlowitz, made in 1699, after the\r\nunsuccessful war in which the Turks laid siege to Vienna, was negotiated on\r\nbehalf of the Porte by Alexander Maurokordatos, a Chian by birth, who had\r\nbecome physician to the Sultan and was virtually the Foreign Minister of\r\nTurkey. His sons, Nicholas and Constantine, were made Hospodars of\r\nWallachia and Moldavia early in the eighteenth century; and from this time\r\nforward, until the outbreak of the Greek insurrection, the governorships of\r\nthe Roumanian provinces were entrusted to Phanariot families. The result\r\nwas that a troop of Greek adventurers passed to the north of the Danube,\r\nand seized upon every office of profit in these unfortunate lands. There\r\nwere indeed individuals among the Hospodars, especially among the\r\nMaurokordati, who rendered good service to their Roumanian subjects; but on\r\nthe whole the Phanariot rule was grasping, dishonest, and cruel. [355] Its\r\nimportance in relation to Greece was not that it Hellenised the Danubian\r\ncountries, for that it signally failed to do; but that it raised the\r\nstandard of Greek education, and enlarged the range of Greek thought, by\r\nopening a political and administrative career to ambitious men. The\r\nconnection of the Phanariots with education was indeed an exceedingly close\r\none. Alexander Maurokordatos was the ardent and generous founder of schools\r\nfor the instruction of his countrymen in Constantinople as well as in other\r\ncities, and for the improvement of the existing language of Greece. His\r\nexample was freely followed throughout the eighteenth century. It is,\r\nindeed, one of the best features in the Greek character that the owner of\r\nwealth has so often been, and still so often is, the promoter of the\r\nculture of his race. As in Germany in the last century, and in Hungary and\r\nBohemia at a more recent date, the national revival of Greece was preceded\r\nby a striking revival of interest in the national language.\r\n\r\n[Greek intellectual movement in the eighteenth century.]\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of ancient Greek was never wholly lost among the priesthood,\r\nbut it had become useless. Nothing was read but the ecclesiastic\r\ncommonplace of a pedantic age; and in the schools kept by the clergy before\r\nthe eighteenth century the ancient language was taught only as a means of\r\nimparting divinity. The educational movement promoted by men like\r\nMaurokordatos had a double end; it revived the knowledge of the great age\r\nof Greece through its literature, and it taught the Greek to regard the\r\nspeech which he actually used not as a mere barbarous patois which each\r\ndistrict had made for itself, but as a language different indeed from that\r\nof the ancient world, yet governed by its own laws, and capable of\r\nperforming the same functions as any other modern tongue. It was now that\r\nthe Greek learnt to call himself Hellen, the name of his forefathers,\r\ninstead of Romaios, a Roman. As the new schools grew up and the old ones\r\nwere renovated or transformed, education ceased to be merely literary. In\r\nthe second half of the eighteenth century science returned in a humble form\r\nto the land that had given it birth, and the range of instruction was\r\nwidened by men who had studied law, physics, and moral philosophy at\r\nforeign Universities. Something of the liberal spirit of the inquirers of\r\nWestern Europe arose among the best Greek teachers. Though no attack was\r\nmade upon the doctrines of the Church, and no direct attack was made upon\r\nthe authority of the Sultan, the duty of religious toleration was\r\nproclaimed in a land where bigotry had hitherto reigned supreme, and the\r\npolitical freedom of ancient Greece was held up as a glorious ideal to a\r\nless happy age. Some of the higher clergy and of the Phanariot instruments\r\nof Turkish rule took fright at the independent spirit of the new learning,\r\nand for a while it seemed as if the intellectual as well as the political\r\nprogress of Greece might be endangered by ecclesiastical ill-will. But the\r\nattachment of the Greek people to the Church was so strong and so universal\r\nthat, although satire might be directed against the Bishops, a breach with\r\nthe Church formed no part of the design of any patriot. The antagonism\r\nbetween episcopal and national feeling, strongest about the end of the\r\neighteenth century, declined during succeeding years, and had almost\r\ndisappeared before the outbreak of the war of liberation.\r\n\r\n[Koraes, 1748-1833.]\r\n\r\n[The language of Modern Greece.]\r\n\r\nThe greatest scholar of modern Greece was also one of its greatest\r\npatriots. Koraes, known as the legislator of the Greek language, was born\r\nin 1748, of Chian parents settled at Smyrna. The love of learning, combined\r\nwith an extreme independence of character, made residence insupportable to\r\nhim in a land where the Turk was always within sight, and where few\r\nopportunities existed for gaining wide knowledge. His parents permitted him\r\nto spend some years at Amsterdam, where a branch of their business was\r\nestablished. Recalled to Smyrna at the age of thirty, Koraes almost\r\nabandoned human society. The hand of a beautiful heiress could not tempt\r\nhim from the austere and solitary life of the scholar; and quitting his\r\nhome, he passed through the medical school of Montpellier, and settled at\r\nParis. He was here when the French Revolution began. The inspiration of\r\nthat time gave to his vast learning and inborn energy a directly patriotic\r\naim. For forty years Koraes pursued the work of serving Greece by the means\r\nopen to the scholar. The political writings in which he addressed the\r\nGreeks themselves or appealed to foreigners in favour of Greece, admirable\r\nas they are, do not form the basis of his fame. The peculiar task of Koraes\r\nwas to give to the reviving Greek nation the national literature and the\r\nform of expression which every civilised people reckons among its most\r\ncherished bonds of unity. Master, down to the minutest details, of the\r\nentire range of Greek writings, and of the history of the Greek language\r\nfrom classical times down to our own century, Koraes was able to select the\r\nHellenic authors, Christian as well as Pagan, whose works were best suited\r\nfor his countrymen in their actual condition, and to illustrate them as no\r\none could who had not himself been born and bred among Greeks. This was one\r\nside of Koraes' literary task. The other was to direct the language of the\r\nfuture Hellenic kingdom into its true course. Classical writing was still\r\nunderstood by the educated in Greece, but the spoken language of the people\r\nwas something widely different. Turkish and Albanian influences had\r\nbarbarised the vocabulary; centuries of ignorance had given play to every\r\nnatural irregularity of local dialect. When the restoration of Greek\r\nindependence came within view, there were some who proposed to revive\r\nartificially each form used in the ancient language, and thus, without any\r\nreal blending, to add the old to the new: others, seeing this to be\r\nimpossible, desired that the common idiom, corrupt as it was, should be\r\naccepted as a literary language. Koraes chose the middle and the rational\r\npath. Taking the best written Greek of the day as his material, he\r\nrecommended that the forms of classical Greek, where they were not wholly\r\nobsolete, should be fixed in the grammar of the language. While ridiculing\r\nthe attempt to restore modes of expression which, even in the written\r\nlanguage, had wholly passed out of use, he proposed to expunge all words\r\nthat were in fact not Greek at all, but foreign, and to replace them by\r\nterms formed according to the natural laws of the language. The Greek,\r\ntherefore, which Koraes desired to see his countrymen recognise as their\r\nlanguage, and which he himself used in his writings, was the written Greek\r\nof the most cultivated persons of his time, purged of its foreign elements,\r\nand methodised by a constant reference to a classical model, which,\r\nhowever, it was not to imitate pedantically. The correctness of this theory\r\nhas been proved by its complete success. The patois which, if it had been\r\nrecognised as the language of the Greek kingdom, would now have made\r\nHerodotus and Plato foreign authors in Athens, is indeed still preserved in\r\nfamiliar conversation, but it is little used in writing and not taught in\r\nschools. A language year by year more closely approximating in its forms to\r\nthat of classical Greece unites the Greeks both with their past and among\r\nthemselves, and serves as the instrument of a widening Hellenic\r\ncivilization in the Eastern Mediterranean. The political object of Koraes\r\nhas been completely attained. No people in Europe is now prouder of its\r\nnative tongue, or turns it to better account in education, than his\r\ncountrymen. In literature, the renovated language has still its work before\r\nit. The lyric poetry that has been written in Greece since the time of\r\nKoraes is not wanting, if a foreigner may express an opinion, in tenderness\r\nand grace The writer who shall ennoble Greek prose with the energy and\r\ndirectness of the ancient style has yet to arise [356]\r\n\r\n[Development of Greek commerce, 1750-1820.]\r\n\r\n[The Treaty of Kainardji, 1774.]\r\n\r\nThe intellectual advance of the Greeks in the eighteenth century was\r\nclosely connected with the development of their commerce, and this in its\r\nturn was connected with events in the greater cycle of European history. A\r\nperiod of comparative peace and order in the Levantine waters, following\r\nthe final expulsion of the Venetians from the Morea in 1718, gave play to\r\nthe natural aptitude of the Greek islanders for coasting-trade. Then ships,\r\nstill small and unfit to venture on long voyages, plied between the\r\nharbours in the Ægæan and in the Black Sea, and brought profit to their\r\nowners in spite of the imposition of burdens from which not only many of\r\nthe Mussulman subjects of the Sultan, but foreign nations protected by\r\ncommercial treaties, were free. It was at this epoch, after Venice had lost\r\nits commercial supremacy in the Eastern Mediterranean, that Russia began to\r\nexercise a direct influence upon the fortunes of Greece. The Empress\r\nCatherine had formed the design of conquering Constantinople, and intended,\r\nunder the title of Protectress of the Christian Church, to use the Greeks\r\nas her allies. In the war which broke out between Russia and Turkey in\r\n1768, a Russian expeditionary force landed in the Morea, and the Greeks\r\nwere persuaded to take up arms. The Moreotes themselves paid dearly for the\r\ntrust which they had placed in the orthodox Empress. They were virtually\r\nabandoned to the vengeance of their oppressors; but to Greece at large the\r\nconditions on which peace was made proved of immense benefit. The Treaty of\r\nKainardji, signed in 1774, gave Russia the express right to make\r\nrepresentations at Constantinople on behalf of the Christian inhabitants of\r\nthe Danubian provinces; it also bound the Sultan to observe certain\r\nconditions in his treatment of the Greek islanders. Out of these clauses,\r\nRussian diplomacy constructed a general right of interference on behalf of\r\nany Christian subjects of the Porte. The Treaty also opened the Black Sea\r\nto Russian ships of commerce, and conferred upon Russia the commercial\r\nprivileges of the most favoured nation. [357] The result of this compact\r\nwas a very remarkable one. The Russian Government permitted hundreds of\r\nGreek shipowners to hoist its own flag, and so changed the footing of Greek\r\nmerchantmen in every port of the Ottoman Empire. The burdens which had\r\nplaced the Greek trader at a disadvantage, when compared with the\r\nMohammedan, vanished. A host of Russian consular agents, often Greeks\r\nthemselves, was scattered over the Levant. Eager for opportunities of\r\nattaching the Greeks to their Russian patrons, quick to make their\r\nnewly-won power felt by the Turks, these men extracted a definite meaning\r\nfrom the clauses of the Treaty of Kainardji, by which the Porte had bound\r\nitself to observe the rights of its Christian subjects. The sense of\r\nsecurity in the course of their business, no less than the emancipation\r\nfrom commercial fetters, gave an immense impulse to Greek traders. Their\r\nships were enlarged; voyages, hitherto limited to the Levant, were extended\r\nto England and even to America; and a considerable armament of cannon was\r\nplaced on board each ship for defence against the attack of Algerian\r\npirates.\r\n\r\n[Foundation of Odessa, 1792.]\r\n\r\n[Death of Rhegas, 1798.]\r\n\r\n[Influence of the French Revolution on Greece.]\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the eighteenth century another war between Turkey and\r\nRussia, resulting in the cession of the district of Oczakoff on the\r\nnorthern shore of the Black Sea, made the Greeks both carriers and vendors\r\nof the corn-export of Southern Russia. The city of Odessa was founded on\r\nthe ceded territory. The merchants who raised it to its sudden prosperity\r\nwere not Russians but Greeks; and in the course of a single generation many\r\na Greek trading-house, which had hitherto deemed the sum of £3,000 to be a\r\nlarge capital, rose to an opulence little behind that of the great London\r\nfirms. Profiting by the neutrality of Turkey or its alliance with England\r\nduring a great part of the revolutionary war, the Greeks succeeded to much\r\nof the Mediterranean trade that was lost by France and its dependencies.\r\nThe increasing intelligence of the people was shown in the fact that\r\nforeigners were no longer employed by Greek merchants as their travelling\r\nagents in distant countries; there were countrymen enough of their own who\r\ncould negotiate with an Englishman or a Dane in his own language. The\r\nrichest Greeks were no doubt those of Odessa and Salonica, not of Hellas\r\nproper; but even the little islands of Hydra and Spetza, the refuge of the\r\nMoreotes whom Catherine had forsaken in 1770, now became communities of no\r\nsmall wealth and spirit. Psara, which was purely Greek, formed with these\r\nAlbanian colonies the nucleus of an Ægæan naval Power. The Ottoman\r\nGovernment, cowed by its recent defeats, and perhaps glad to see the means\r\nof increasing its resources, made no attempt to check the growth of the\r\nHellenic armed marine. Under the very eyes of the Sultan, the Hydriote and\r\nPsarian captains, men as venturesome as the sea-kings of ancient Greece,\r\naccumulated the artillery which was hereafter to hold its own against many\r\nan Ottoman man-of-war, and to sweep the Turkish merchantmen from the\r\nÆgæan. Eighteen years before the Greek insurrection broke out, Koraes,\r\ncalling the attention of Western Europe to the progress made by his\r\ncountry, wrote the following significant words:--\"If the Ottoman Government\r\ncould have foreseen that the Greeks would create a merchant-navy, composed\r\nof several hundred vessels, most of them regularly armed, it would have\r\ncrushed the movement at its commencement. It is impossible to calculate the\r\neffects which may result from the creation of this marine, or the influence\r\nwhich it may exert both upon the destiny of the oppressed nation and upon\r\nthat of its oppressors.\" [358] Like its classic sisterland in the\r\nMediterranean, Greece was stirred by the far-sounding voices of the French\r\nRevolution. The Declaration of the Rights of Man, the revival of a supposed\r\nantique Republicanism, the victories of Hoche and Bonaparte, successively\r\nkindled the enthusiasm of a race already restless under the Turkish yoke.\r\nFrance drew to itself some of the hopes that had hitherto been fixed\r\nentirely upon Russia. Images and ideas of classic freedom invaded the\r\ndomain where the Church had hitherto been all in all; the very sailors\r\nbegan to call their boats by the names of Spartan and Athenian heroes, as\r\nwell as by those of saints and martyrs. In 1797 Venice fell, and Bonaparte\r\nseized its Greek possessions, the Ionian Islands. There was something of\r\nthe forms of liberation in the establishment of French rule; the\r\ninhabitants of Zante were at least permitted to make a bonfire of the\r\nstately wigs worn by their Venetian masters. Great changes seemed to be\r\nnear at hand. It was not yet understood that France fought for empire, not\r\nfor justice; and the man who, above all others, represented the early\r\nspirit of the revolution among the Greeks, the poet Rhegas, looked to\r\nBonaparte to give the signal for the rising of the whole of the Christian\r\npopulations subject to Mohammedan rule. Rhegas, if he was not a wise\r\npolitician, was a thoroughly brave man, and he was able to serve his\r\ncountry as a martyr. While engaged in Austria in conspiracies against the\r\nSultan's Government, and probably in intrigues with Bernadotte, French\r\nambassador at Vienna, he was arrested by the agents of Thugut, and handed\r\nover to the Turks. He was put to death at Belgrade, with five of his\r\ncompanions, in May, 1798. The songs of Rhegas soon passed through every\r\nhousehold in Greece. They were a precious treasure to his countrymen, and\r\nthey have immortalised his name as a patriot. But the work which he had\r\nbegun languished for a time after his death. The series of events which\r\nfollowed Bonaparte's invasion of Egypt extinguished the hope of the\r\nliberation of Greece by the French Republic. Among the higher Greek clergy\r\nthe alliance with the godless followers of Voltaire was seen with no\r\nfavourable eye. The Porte was even able to find a Christian Patriarch to\r\nset his name to a pastoral, warning the faithful against the sin of\r\nrebellion, and reminding them that, while Satan was creating the Lutherans\r\nand Calvinists, the infinite mercy of God had raised up the Ottoman Power\r\nin order that the Orthodox Church might be preserved pure from the heresies\r\nof the West. [359]\r\n\r\n[The Ionian Islands. 1798-1815.]\r\n\r\n[Ali Pasha, 1798-1821.]\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1798 down to the Peace of Paris, Greece was more affected by\r\nthe vicissitudes of the Ionian Islands and by the growth of dominion of Ali\r\nPasha in Albania than by the earlier revolutionary ideas. France was\r\ndeprived of its spoils by the combined Turkish and Russian fleets in the\r\ncoalition of 1799, and the Ionian Islands were made into a Republic under\r\nthe protection of the Czar and the Sultan. It was in the native\r\nadministration of Corfu that the career of Capodistrias began. At the peace\r\nof Tilsit the Czar gave these islands back to Napoleon, and Capodistrias,\r\nwhose ability had gained general attention, accepted an invitation to enter\r\nthe Russian service. The islands were then successively beleaguered and\r\nconquered by the English, with the exception of Corfu; and after the fall\r\nof Napoleon they became a British dependency. Thus the three greatest\r\nPowers of Europe were during the first years of this century in constant\r\nrivalry on the east of the Adriatic, and a host of Greeks, some fugitives,\r\nsome adventurers, found employment among their armed forces. The most\r\nfamous chieftain in the war of liberation, Theodore Kolokotrones, a Klepht\r\nof the Morea, was for some years major of a Greek regiment in the pay of\r\nEngland. In the meantime Ali Pasha, on the neighbouring mainland, neither\r\nrested himself nor allowed any of his neighbours to rest. The Suliotes,\r\nvanquished after years of heroic defence, migrated in a body to the Ionian\r\nIslands in 1804. Every Klepht and Armatole of the Epirote border had fought\r\nat some time either for Ali or against him; for in the extension of his\r\nviolent and crafty rule Ali was a friend to-day and an enemy to-morrow\r\nalike to Greek, Turk, and Albanian. When his power was at its height, Ali's\r\ncourt at Janina was as much Greek as it was Mohammedan: soldiers,\r\nmerchants, professors, all, as it was said, with a longer or a shorter rope\r\nround their necks, played their part in the society of the Epirote capital.\r\n[360] Among the officers of Ali's army there were some who were soon to be\r\nthe military rivals of Kolokotrones in the Greek insurrection: Ali's\r\nphysician, Dr. Kolettes, was gaining an experience and an influence among\r\nthese men which afterwards placed him at the head of the Government. For\r\ngood or for evil, it was felt that the establishment of a virtually\r\nindependent kingdom of Albania must deeply affect the fate of Greece; and\r\nwhen at length Ali openly defied the Sultan, and Turkish armies closed\r\nround his castle at Janina, the conflict between the Porte and its most\r\npowerful vassal gave the Greeks the signal to strike for their own\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n[The Hetæria Philike.]\r\n\r\nThe secret society, which under the name of Hetæria Philike, or association\r\nof friends, inaugurated the rebellion of Greece, was founded in 1814, after\r\nit had become clear that the Congress of Vienna would take no steps on\r\nbehalf of the Christian subjects of the Porte. The founders of this society\r\nwere traders of Odessa, and its earliest members seem to have been drawn\r\nmore from the Greeks in Russia and in the Danubian provinces than from\r\nthose of Greece Proper. The object of the conspiracy was the expulsion of\r\nthe Turk from Europe, and the re-establishment of a Greek Eastern Empire.\r\nIt was pretended by the council of directors that the Emperor Alexander had\r\nsecretly joined them; and the ingenious fiction was circulated that a\r\nsociety for the preservation of Greek antiquities, for which Capodistrias\r\nhad gained the patronage of the Czar and other eminent men at the Congress\r\nof Vienna, was in fact this political association in disguise. The real\r\nchiefs of the conspiracy always spoke of themselves as acting under the\r\ninstructions of a nameless superior power. They were as little troubled by\r\nscruple in thus deceiving their followers as they were in planning a\r\ngeneral massacre of the Turks, and in murdering their own agents when they\r\nwished to have them out of the way. The ultimate design of the Hetæria was\r\nan unsound one, and its operations were based upon an imposture; but in\r\nexciting the Greeks against Turkish rule, and in inspiring confidence in\r\nits own resources and authority, it was completely successful. In the\r\ncourse of six years every Greek of note, both in Greece itself and in the\r\nadjacent countries, had joined the association. The Turkish Government had\r\nreceived warnings of the danger which threatened it, but disregarded them\r\nuntil revolt was on the point of breaking out. The very improvement in the\r\ncondition of the Christians, the absence of any crying oppression or\r\noutrage in Greece during late years, probably lulled the anxieties of\r\nSultan Mahmud, who, terrible as he afterwards proved himself, had not\r\nhitherto been without sympathy for the Rayah. But the history of France, no\r\nless than the history of Greece, shows that it is not the excess, but the\r\nsense, of wrong that produces revolution. A people may be so crushed by\r\noppression as to suffer all conceivable misery with patience. It is when\r\nthe pulse has again begun to beat strong, when the eye is fixed no longer\r\non the ground, and the knowledge of good and evil again burns in the heart,\r\nthat the right and the duty of resistance is felt.\r\n\r\n[Capodistrias and Hypsilanti.]\r\n\r\nEarly in 1820 the ferment in Greece had become so general that the chiefs\r\nof the Hetæria were compelled to seek at St. Petersburg for the Russian\r\nleader who had as yet existed only in their imagination. There was no\r\ndispute as to the person to whom the task of restoring the Eastern Empire\r\nrightfully belonged. Capodistrias, at once a Greek and Foreign Minister of\r\nRussia, stood in the front rank of European statesmen; he was known to love\r\nthe Greek cause; he was believed to possess the strong personal affection\r\nof the Emperor Alexander. The deputies of the Hetæria besought him to place\r\nhimself at its head. Capodistrias, however, knew better than any other man\r\nthe force of those influences which would dissuade the Czar from assisting\r\nGreece. He had himself published a pamphlet in the preceding year\r\nrecommending his countrymen to take no rash step; and, apart from all\r\npersonal considerations, he probably believed that he could serve Greece\r\nbetter as Minister of Russia than by connecting himself with any dangerous\r\nenterprise. He rejected the offers of the Hetærists, who then turned to a\r\nsoldier of some distinction in the Russian army, Prince Alexander\r\nHypsilanti, a Greek exile, whose grandfather, after governing Wallachia as\r\nHospodar, had been put to death by the Turks for complicity with the\r\ndesigns of Rhegas. It is said that Capodistrias encouraged Hypsilanti to\r\nattempt the task which he had himself declined, and that he allowed him to\r\nbelieve that if Greece once rose in arms the assistance of Russia could not\r\nlong be withheld. [361] Hypsilanti, sacrificing his hopes of the recovery\r\nof a great private fortune through the intercession of the Czar at\r\nConstantinople, placed himself at the head of the Hetæria, and entered upon\r\na career, for which, with the exception of personal courage proved in the\r\ncampaigns against Napoleon, he seems to have possessed no single\r\nqualification.\r\n\r\n[The Herærist plan.]\r\n\r\nIn October, 1820, the leading Hetærists met in council at Ismail to decide\r\nwhether the insurrection against the Turk should begin in Greece itself or\r\nin the Danubian provinces. Most of the Greek officers in the service of\r\nSutsos, the Hospodar of Moldavia, were ready to join the revolt. With the\r\nexception of a few companies serving as police, there were no Turkish\r\nsoldiers north of the Danube, the Sultan having bound himself by the Treaty\r\nof Bucharest to send no troops into the Principalities without the Czar's\r\nconsent. It does not appear that the Hetærists had yet formed any\r\ncalculation as to the probable action of the Roumanian people: they had\r\ncertainly no reason to believe that this race bore good-will to the Greeks,\r\nor that it would make any effort to place a Greek upon the Sultan's throne.\r\nThe conspirators at Ismail were so far on the right track that they decided\r\nthat the outbreak should begin, not on the Danube, but in Peloponnesus.\r\nHypsilanti, however, full of the belief that Russia would support him,\r\nreversed this conclusion, and determined to raise his standard in Moldavia.\r\n[362] And now for the first time some account was taken of the Roumanian\r\npopulation. It was known that the mass of the people groaned under the\r\nfeudal oppression of the Boyards, or landowners, and that the Boyards\r\nthemselves detested the government of the Greek Hospodars. A plan found\r\nfavour among Hypsilanti's advisers that the Wallachian peasantry should\r\nfirst be called to arms by a native leader for the redress of their own\r\ngrievances, and that the Greeks should then step in and take control of the\r\ninsurrectionary movement. Theodor Wladimiresco, a Roumanian who had served\r\nin the Russian army, was ready to raise the standard of revolt among his\r\ncountrymen. It did not occur to the Hetærists that Wladimiresco might have\r\na purpose of his own, or that the Roumanian population might prefer to see\r\nthe Greek adventure fail. No sovereign by divine right had a firmer belief\r\nin his prerogative within his own dominions than Hypsilanti in his power to\r\ncommand or outwit Roumanians, Slavs, and all other Christian subjects of\r\nthe Sultan.\r\n\r\n[Hypsilanti in Roumania March, 1821.]\r\n\r\nThe feint of a native rising was planned and executed. In February, 1821,\r\nwhile Hypsilanti waited on the Russian frontier, Wladimiresco proclaimed\r\nthe abolition of feudal services, and marched with a horde of peasants upon\r\nBucharest. On the 16th of March the Hetærists began their own insurrection\r\nby a deed of blood that disgraced the Christian cause. Karavias, a\r\nconspirator commanding the Greek troops of the Hospodar at Galatz, let\r\nloose his soldiers and murdered every Turk who could be hunted down.\r\nHypsilanti crossed the Pruth next day, and appeared at Jassy with a few\r\nhundred followers. A proclamation was published in which the Prince called\r\nupon all Christian subjects of the Porte to rise, and declared that a great\r\nEuropean Power, meaning Russia, supported him in his enterprise. Sutsos,\r\nthe Hospodar, at once handed over all the apparatus of government, and\r\nsupplied the insurgents with a large sum of money. Two thousand armed men,\r\nsome of them regular troops, gathered round Hypsilanti at Jassy. The roads\r\nto the Danube lay open before him; the resources of Moldavia were at his\r\ndisposal; and had he at once thrown a force into Galatz and Ibraila, he\r\nmight perhaps have made it difficult for Turkish troops to gain a footing\r\non the north of the Danube.\r\n\r\n[The Czar disavows the movement.]\r\n\r\nBut the incapacity of the leader became evident from the moment when he\r\nbegan his enterprise. He loitered for a week at Jassy, holding court and\r\nconferring titles, and then, setting out for Bucharest, wasted three weeks\r\nmore upon the road. In the meantime the news of the insurrection, and of\r\nthe fraudulent use that had been made of his own name, reached the Czar,\r\nwho was now engaged at the Congress of Laibach. Alexander was at this\r\nmoment abandoning himself heart and soul to Metternich's reactionary\r\ninfluence, and ordering his generals to make ready a hundred thousand men\r\nto put down the revolution in Piedmont. He received with dismay a letter\r\nfrom Hypsilanti invoking his aid in a rising which was first described in\r\nthe phrases of the Holy Alliance as the result of a divine inspiration, and\r\nthen exhibited as a master-work of secret societies and widespread\r\nconspiracy. A stern answer was sent back. Hypsilanti was dismissed from the\r\nRussian service; he was ordered to lay down his arms, and a manifesto was\r\npublished by the Russian Consul at Jassy declaring that the Czar repudiated\r\nand condemned the enterprise with which his name had been connected. The\r\nPatriarch of Constantinople, helpless in the presence of Sultan Mahmud, now\r\nissued a ban of excommunication against the leader and all his followers.\r\nSome weeks later the Congress of Laibach officially branded the Greek\r\nrevolt as a work of the same anarchical spirit which had produced the\r\nrevolutions of Italy and Spain. [363]\r\n\r\n[The enterprise fails.]\r\n\r\nThe disavowal of the Hetærist enterprise by the Czar was fatal to its\r\nsuccess. Hypsilanti, indeed, put on a bold countenance and pretended that\r\nthe public utterances of the Russian Court were a mere blind, and in\r\ncontradiction to the private instructions given him by the Czar; but no one\r\nbelieved him. The Roumanians, when they knew that aid was not coming from\r\nRussia, held aloof, or treated insurgents as enemies. Turkish troops\r\ncrossed the Danube, and Hypsilanti fell back from Bucharest towards the\r\nAustrian frontier. Wladimiresco followed him, not however to assist him in\r\nhis struggle, but to cut off his retreat and to betray him to the enemy. It\r\nwas in vain that the bravest of Hypsilanti's followers, Georgakis, a Greek\r\nfrom Olympus, sought the Wallachian at his own headquarters, exposed his\r\ntreason to the Hetærist officers who surrounded him, and carried him, a\r\ndoomed man, to the Greek camp. Wladimiresco's death was soon avenged. The\r\nTurks advanced. Hypsilanti was defeated in a series of encounters, and fled\r\nignobly from his followers, to seek a refuge, and to find a prison, in\r\nAustria. Bands of his soldiers, forsaken by their leader, sold their lives\r\ndearly in a hopeless struggle. At Skuleni, on the Pruth, a troop of four\r\nhundred men refused to cross to Russian soil until they had given battle to\r\nthe enemy. Standing at bay, they met the onslaught of ten times their\r\nnumber of pursuers. Georgakis, who had sworn that he would never fall alive\r\ninto the enemy's hands, kept his word. Surrounded by Turkish troops in the\r\ntower of a monastery, he threw open the doors for those of his comrades who\r\ncould to escape, and then setting fire to a chest of powder, perished in\r\nthe explosion, together with his assailants.\r\n\r\n[Revolt of Morea, April 2, 1891.]\r\n\r\nThe Hetærist invasion of the Principalities had ended in total failure, and\r\nwith it there passed away for ever the dream of re-establishing the Eastern\r\nEmpire under Greek ascendancy. But while this enterprise, planned in vain\r\nreliance upon foreign aid and in blind assumption of leadership over an\r\nalien race, collapsed through the indifference of a people to whom the\r\nGreeks were known only as oppressors, that genuine uprising of the Greek\r\nnation, which, in spite of the nullity of its leaders, in spite of the\r\ncrimes, the disunion, the perversity of a race awaking from centuries of\r\nservitude, was to add one more to the free peoples of Europe, broke out in\r\nthe real home of the Hellenes, in the Morea and the islands of the Ægæan.\r\nSoon after Hypsilanti's appearance in Moldavia the Turkish governor of the\r\nMorea, anticipating a general rebellion of the Greeks, had summoned the\r\nPrimates of his province to Tripolitza, with the view of seizing them as\r\nhostages. The Primates of the northern district set out, but halted on\r\ntheir way, debating whether they should raise the standard of insurrection\r\nor wait for events. While they lingered irresolutely at Kalavryta the\r\ndecision passed out of their hands, and the people rose throughout the\r\nMorea. The revolt of the Moreot Greeks against their oppressors was from\r\nthe first, and with set purpose, a war of extermination. \"The Turk,\" they\r\nsang in their war-songs, \"shall live no longer, neither in Morea nor in the\r\nwhole earth.\" This terrible resolution was, during the first weeks of the\r\nrevolt, carried into literal effect. The Turks who did not fly from their\r\ncountry-houses to the towns where there were garrisons or citadels to\r\ndefend them, were attacked and murdered with their entire families, men,\r\nwomen and children. This was the first act of the revolution; and within a\r\nfew weeks after the 2nd of April, on which the first outbreaks occurred,\r\nthe open country was swept clear of its Ottoman population, which had\r\nnumbered about 25,000, and the residue of the lately dominant race was\r\ncollected within the walls of Patras, Tripolitza, and other towns, which\r\nthe Greeks forthwith began to beleaguer. [364]\r\n\r\n[Terrorism at Constantinople.]\r\n\r\n[Execution of the Patriarch, April 22.]\r\n\r\nThe news of the revolt of the Morea and of the massacre of Mohammedans\r\nreached Constantinople, striking terror into the politicians of the Turkish\r\ncapital, and rousing the Sultan Mahmud to a vengeance tiger-like in its\r\nferocity, but deliberate and calculated like every bloody deed of this\r\nresolute and able sovereign. Reprisals had already been made upon the\r\nGreeks at Constantinople for the acts of Hypsilanti, and a number of\r\ninnocent persons had been put to death by the executioner, but no general\r\nattack upon the Christians had been suggested, nor had the work of\r\npunishment passed out of the hands of the government itself. Now, however,\r\nthe fury of the Mohammedan populace was let loose upon the infidel. The\r\nSultan called upon his subjects to arm themselves in defence of their\r\nfaith. Executions were redoubled; soldiers and mobs devastated Greek\r\nsettlements on the Bosphorus; and on the most sacred day of the Greek\r\nChurch a blow was struck which sent a thrill over Eastern Europe. The\r\nPatriarch of Constantinople had celebrated the service which ushers in the\r\ndawn of Easter Sunday, when he was summoned by the Dragoman of the Porte to\r\nappear before a Synod hastily assembled. There an order of the Sultan was\r\nread declaring Gregorius IV. a traitor, and degrading him from his office.\r\nThe Synod was commanded to elect his successor. It did so. While the new\r\nArchbishop was receiving his investiture, Gregorius was led out, and was\r\nhanged, still wearing his sacred robes, at the gate of his palace. His body\r\nremained during Easter Sunday and the two following days at the place of\r\nexecution. It was then given to the Jews to be insulted, dragged through\r\nthe streets, and cast into the sea. The Archbishops of Adrianople,\r\nSalonica, and Tirnovo suffered death on the same Easter Sunday. The body of\r\nGregorius, floating in the waves, was picked up by a Greek ship and carried\r\nto Odessa. Brought, as it was believed, by a miracle to Christian soil, the\r\nrelics of the Patriarch received at the hands of the Russian government the\r\nfuneral honours of a martyr. Gregorius had no doubt had dealings with the\r\nHetærists; but he was put to death untried; and whatever may have been the\r\nreal extent of his offence, he was executed not for this but in order to\r\nstrike terror into the Sultan's Christian subjects.\r\n\r\n[Massacre of Christians, April-October.]\r\n\r\n[Effect on Russia.]\r\n\r\n[Russian ambassador leaves Constantinople, July 27.]\r\n\r\nDuring the succeeding months, in Asia Minor as well as in Macedonia and at\r\nConstantinople itself, there were wholesale massacres of the Christians,\r\nand the churches of the Greeks were pillaged or destroyed by their enemies,\r\nboth Jews and Turks. Smyrna, Adrianople, and Salonica, in so far as these\r\ntowns were Greek, were put to the sack; thousands of the inhabitants were\r\nslain by the armed mobs who held command, or were sold into slavery. It was\r\nonly the fear of a war with Russia which at length forced Sultan Mahmud to\r\nstop these deeds of outrage and to restore some of the conditions of\r\ncivilised life in the part of his dominions which was not in revolt. The\r\nRussian army and nation would have avenged the execution of the Patriarch\r\nby immediate war if popular instincts had governed its ruler. Strogonoff,\r\nthe ambassador at Constantinople, at once proposed to the envoys of the\r\nother Powers to unite in calling up war-ships for the protection of the\r\nChristians. Joint action was, however, declined by Lord Strangford, the\r\nrepresentative of England, and the Porte was encouraged by the attitude of\r\nthis politician to treat the threats of Strogonoff with indifference. There\r\nwas an interval during which the destiny of a great part of Eastern Europe\r\ndepended upon the fluctuations of a single infirm will. The Czar had\r\nthoroughly identified himself while at Laibach with the principles and the\r\npolicy of European conservatism, and had assented to the declaration in\r\nwhich Metternich placed the Greek rebellion, together with the Spanish and\r\nItalian insurrections, under the ban of Europe. Returning to St.\r\nPetersburg, Alexander, in spite of the veil that intercepts from every\r\nsovereign the real thoughts and utterances of his people, found himself\r\nwithin the range of widely different influences. Russian passions were not\r\nroused by what might pass in Italy or Spain. The Russian priest, the\r\nsoldier, the peasant understood nothing of theories of federal\r\nintervention, and of the connection between Neapolitan despotism and the\r\ntreaties of 1815: but his blood boiled when he heard that the chief priest\r\nof his Church had been murdered by the Sultan, and that a handful of his\r\nbrethren were fighting for their faith unhelped. Alexander felt to some\r\nextent the throb of national spirit. There had been a time in his life when\r\na single hour of strong emotion or of overpowering persuasion had made him\r\nrenounce every obligation and unite with Napoleon against his own allies;\r\nand there were those who in 1821 believed that the Czar would as suddenly\r\nbreak loose from his engagements with Metternich and throw himself, with a\r\nfanatical army and nation, into a crusade against the Turk. Sultan Mahmud\r\nhad himself given to the Russian party of action a ground for denouncing\r\nhim in the name of Russian honour and interests independently of all that\r\nrelated to Greece. In order to prevent the escape of suspected persons, the\r\nPorte had ordered Russian vessels to be searched at Constantinople, and it\r\nhad forced all corn-ships coming from the Euxine to discharge their cargoes\r\nat the Bosphorus, under the apprehension that the corn-supplies of the\r\ncapital would be cut off by Greek vessels in command of the Ægæan.\r\nFurther, Russia had by treaty the right to insist that the Danubian\r\nPrincipalities should be governed by their civil authorities, the\r\nHospodars, and not by Turkish Pashas, insurrection in Wallachia had been\r\nput down, but the rule of Hospodars had not been restored; Turkish\r\ngenerals, at the head of their forces, still administered their provinces\r\nunder military law. On all these points Russia had at least the semblance\r\nof grievances of its own. The outrages which shocked all Europe were not\r\nthe only wrong which Russian pride called upon the Czar to redress. The\r\ninfluence of Capodistrias revived at St. Petersburg. A despatch was sent to\r\nConstantinople declaring that the Porte had begun a war for life or death\r\nwith the Christian religion, and that its continued existence among the\r\nPowers of Europe must depend upon its undertaking to restore the churches\r\nwhich had been destroyed, to guarantee the inviolability of Christian\r\nworship in the future, and to discriminate in its punishments between the\r\ninnocent and the guilty. Presenting ultimatum from his master, Strogonoff,\r\nin accordance with his instructions, demanded a written answer within eight\r\ndays. No such answer came. On the 27th of July the ambassador quitted\r\nConstantinople. War seemed to be on the point of breaking out.\r\n\r\n[Eastern policy of Austria.]\r\n\r\nThe capital where these events were watched with the greatest apprehension\r\nwas Vienna. The fortunes of the Ottoman Empire have always been most\r\nintimately connected with those of Austria; and although the long struggle\r\nof the House of Hapsburg with Napoleon and its wars in recent times with\r\nPrussia and with Italy have made the western aspect of Austrian policy more\r\nprominent and more familiar than its eastern one, the eastern interests of\r\nthe monarchy have always been at least as important in the eyes of its\r\nactual rulers. Before the year 1720 Austria, not Russia, was the great\r\nenemy of Turkey and the aggressive Power of the east of Europe. After 1780\r\nthe Emperor Joseph had united with Catherine of Russia in a plan for\r\ndividing the Sultan's dominions in Europe, and actually waged a war for\r\nthis purpose. In 1795 the alliance, with the same object, had been\r\nprospectively revived by Thugut; in 1809, after the Treaty of Tilsit,\r\nMetternich had determined in the last resort to combine with Napoleon and\r\nAlexander in dismembering Turkey, if all diplomatic means should fail to\r\nprevent a joint attack on the Porte by France and Russia. But this\r\nresolution had been adopted by Metternich only as a matter of necessity,\r\nand in view of a combination which threatened to reduce Austria to the\r\nposition of a vassal State. Metternich's own definite and consistent policy\r\nafter 1814 was the maintenance of the Ottoman Empire. His statesmanship\r\nwas, as a rule, governed by fear; and his fear of Alexander was second only\r\nto his old fear of Napoleon. Times were changed since Joseph and Thugut\r\ncould hope to enter upon a game of aggression with Russia upon equal terms.\r\nThe Austrian army had been beaten in every battle that it had fought during\r\nnearly twenty years. Province after province had been severed from it,\r\nwithout, except in the Tyrol, raising a hand in its support; and when in\r\n1821 the Minister compared Austria's actual Empire and position in Europe,\r\nwon and maintained in great part by his own diplomacy, with the ruin to\r\nwhich a series of wars had brought it ten years before, he might well thank\r\nHeaven that international Congresses were still so much in favour with the\r\nCourts, and tremble at the clash of arms which from the remote Morea\r\nthreatened to call Napoleon's northern conquerors once more into the field\r\n[365]\r\n\r\n[Eastern policy of England.]\r\n\r\nEngland was not, like Austria, exposed to actual danger by the advance of\r\nRussia towards the Ægæan; but the growth of Russian power had been viewed\r\nwith alarm by English politicians since 1788, when Pitt had formed a triple\r\nalliance with Prussia and Holland for the purpose of defending the Porte\r\nagainst the attacks of Catherine and Joseph. The interest of Great Britain\r\nin the maintenance of the Ottoman Empire had not been laid down as a\r\nprinciple before that date, nor was it then acknowledged by the Whig party.\r\nIt was asserted by Pitt from considerations relating to the European\r\nbalance of power, not, as in our own times, with a direct reference to\r\nEngland's position in India. The course of events from 1792 to 1807 made\r\nEngland and Russia for awhile natural allies; but this friendship was\r\nturned into hostility by the Treaty of Tilsit; and although after a few\r\nyears Alexander was again fighting for the same cause as Great Britain, and\r\nthe public opinion of this country enthusiastically hailed the issue of the\r\nMoscow campaign, English statesmen never forgot the interview upon the\r\nNiemen, and never, in the brightest moments of victory, regarded Alexander\r\nwithout some secret misgivings. During the campaign of 1814 in France,\r\nCastlereagh's willingness to negotiate with Bonaparte was due in great part\r\nto the fear that Alexander's high-wrought resolutions would collapse before\r\nNapoleon could be thoroughly crushed, and that reaction would carry him\r\ninto a worse peace than that which he then disdained. [366] The\r\nnegotiations at the Congress of Vienna brought Great Britain and Russia, as\r\nit has been seen, into an antagonism which threatened to end in the resort\r\nto arms; and the tension which then and for some time afterwards existed\r\nbetween the two governments led English Ministers to speak, certainly in\r\nexaggerated and misleading language, of the mutual hostility of the English\r\nand the Russian nations. From 1815 to 1821 the Czar had been jealously\r\nwatched. It had been rumoured over and over again that he was preparing to\r\ninvade the Ottoman Empire; and when the rebellion of the Greeks broke out,\r\nthe one thought of Castlereagh and his colleagues was that Russia must be\r\nprevented from throwing itself into the fray, and that the interests of\r\nGreat Britain required that the authority of the Sultan should as soon as\r\npossible be restored throughout his dominions.\r\n\r\n[Fears of new period of warfare.]\r\n\r\n[Metternich and the Greeks.]\r\n\r\nBoth at London therefore and at Vienna the rebellion of Greece was viewed\r\nby governments only as an unfortunate disturbance which was likely to\r\nexcite war between Russia and its neighbours, and to imperil the peace of\r\nEurope at large. It may seem strange that the spectacle of a nation rising\r\nto assert its independence should not even have aroused the question\r\nwhether its claims deserved to be considered. But to do justice at least to\r\nthe English Ministers of 1821, it must be remembered how terrible, how\r\noverpowering, were the memories left by the twenty years of European war\r\nthat had closed in 1815, and at how vast a cost to mankind the regeneration\r\nof Greece would have been effected, if, as then seemed probable, it had\r\nranged the Great Powers again in arms against one another, and re-kindled\r\nthe spirit of military aggression which for a whole generation had made\r\nEurope the prey of rival coalitions. It is impossible to read the letter in\r\nwhich Castlereagh pleaded with the Czar to sacrifice his own glory and\r\npopularity to the preservation of European peace, without perceiving in\r\nwhat profound earnestness the English statesman sought to avert the renewal\r\nof an epoch of conflict, and how much the apprehension of coming calamity\r\npredominated in his own mind over the mere jealousy of an extension of\r\nRussian power. [367] If Castlereagh had no thought for Greece itself, it\r\nwas because the larger interests of Europe wholly absorbed him, and because\r\nhe lacked the imagination and the insight to conceive of a better\r\nadjustment of European affairs under the widening recognition of national\r\nrights. The Minister of Austria, to whom at this crisis Castlereagh looked\r\nas his natural ally, had no doubt the same dread of a renewed convulsion of\r\nEurope, but in his case it was mingled with considerations of a much\r\nnarrower kind. It is not correct to say that Metternich was indifferent to\r\nthe Greek cause; he actually hated it, because it gave a stimulus to the\r\nliberal movement of Germany. In his empty and pedantic philosophy of human\r\naction, Metternich linked together every form of national aspiration and\r\nunrest as something presumptuous and wanton. He understood nothing of the\r\ndebt that mankind owes to the spirit of freedom. He was just as ready to\r\ndogmatise upon the wickedness of the English Reform Bill as he was to trace\r\nthe hand of Capodistrias in every tumult in Servia or the Morea: and even\r\nif there had been no fear of Russian aggression in the background, he would\r\ninstinctively have condemned the Greek revolt when he saw that the\r\nlight-headed professors in the German Universities were beginning to\r\nagitate in its favour, and that the recalcitrant minor Courts regarded it\r\nwith some degree of sympathy.\r\n\r\n[Alexander adheres to policy of peace.]\r\n\r\n[Capdostrias retires, Aug 1822.]\r\n\r\nThe policy of Metternich in the Eastern Question had for its object the\r\nmaintenance of the existing order of things; and as it was certain that\r\nsome satisfaction or other must be given to Russian pride, Metternich's\r\ncounsel was that the grievances of the Czar which were specifically Russian\r\nshould be clearly distinguished from questions relating to the independence\r\nof Greece; and that on the former the Porte should be recommended to agree\r\nwith its adversary quickly, the good offices of Europe being employed\r\nwithin given limits on the Czar's behalf; so that, the Russian causes of\r\ncomplaint being removed, Alexander might without loss of honour leave the\r\nGreeks to be subdued, and resume the diplomatic relations with\r\nConstantinople which had been so perilously severed by Strogonoff's\r\ndeparture. It remained for the Czar to decide whether, as head of Russia\r\nand protector of the Christians of the East, he would solve the Eastern\r\nQuestion by his own sword, or whether, constant to the principle and ideal\r\nof international action to which he had devoted himself since 1815, he\r\nwould commit his cause to the joint mediation of Europe, and accept such\r\nsolution of the problem as his allies might attain. In the latter case it\r\nwas clear that no blow would be struck on behalf of Greece. For a year or\r\nmore the balance wavered; at length the note of triumph sounded in the\r\nAustrian Cabinet. Capodistrias, the representative of the Greek cause at\r\nSt. Petersburg, rightly measured the force of the opposing impulses in the\r\nCzar's mind. He saw that Alexander, interested as he was in Italy and\r\nSpain, would never break with that federation of the Courts which he had\r\nhimself created, nor shake off the influences of legitimism which had\r\ndominated him since the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle. Submitting when\r\ncontention had become hopeless, and anticipating his inevitable fall by a\r\nvoluntary retirement from public affairs, Capodistrias, still high in\r\ncredit and reputation, quitted St. Petersburg under the form leave of\r\nabsence, and withdrew to Geneva, there to await events, and to enjoy the\r\ndistinction of a patriot whom love for Greece had constrained to abandon\r\none of the most splendid positions in Europe. Grave, melancholy, and\r\naustere, as one who suffered with his country, Capodistrias remained in\r\nprivate life till the vanquished cause had become the victorious one, and\r\nthe liberated Greek nation called him to place himself at its head.\r\n\r\n[Extension of the Greek revolt.]\r\n\r\n[Central Greece.]\r\n\r\n[Fall of Ali Pasha, Feb., 1822.]\r\n\r\n[Chalcidice.]\r\n\r\nAn international diplomatic campaign of vast activity and duration began in\r\nthe year 1821, but the contest of arms was left, as Metternich desired, to\r\nthe Greeks and the Turks alone. The first act of the war was the\r\ninsurrection of the Morea: the second was the extension of this\r\ninsurrection over parts of Continental Greece and the Archipelago, and its\r\nsummary extinction by the Turk in certain districts, which in consequence\r\nremained for the future outside the area of hostilities, and so were not\r\nultimately included in the Hellenic Kingdom. Central Greece, that is, the\r\ncountry lying immediately north of the Corinthian Gulf, broke into revolt a\r\nfew weeks later than the Morea. The rising against the Mohammedans was\r\ndistinguished by the same merciless spirit: the men were generally\r\nmassacred; the women, if not killed, were for the most part sold into\r\nslavery; and when, after an interval of three years, Lord Byron came to\r\nMissolonghi, he found that a miserable band of twenty-three captive women\r\nformed the sole remnant of the Turkish population of that town. Thessaly,\r\nwith some exceptions, remained passive, and its inaction was of the utmost\r\nservice to the Turkish cause; for Ali Pasha in Epirus was now being\r\nbesieged by the Sultan's armies, and if Thessaly had risen in the rear of\r\nthese troops, they could scarcely have escaped destruction. Khurshid, the\r\nOttoman commander conducting the siege of Janina, held firmly to his task,\r\nin spite of the danger which threatened his communications, and in spite of\r\nthe circumstance that his whole household had fallen into the hands of the\r\nMoreot insurgents. His tenacity saved the border-provinces for the Ottoman\r\nEmpire. No combination was effected between Ali and the Greeks, and at the\r\nbeginning of 1822 the Albanian chieftain lost both his stronghold and his\r\nlife. In the remoter district of Chalcidice, on the Macedonian coast, where\r\nthe promontory of Athos and the two parallel peninsulas run out into the\r\nÆgæan, and a Greek population, clearly severed from the Slavic inhabitants\r\nof the mainland, maintained its own communal and religious organisation,\r\nthe national revolt broke out under Hetærist leaders. The monks of Mount\r\nAthos, like their neighbours, took up arms. But there was little sympathy\r\nbetween the privileged chiefs of these abbeys and the desperate men who had\r\ncome to head the revolt. The struggle was soon abandoned; and, partly by\r\nforce of arms, partly by negotiation, the authority of the Sultan was\r\nrestored without much difficulty throughout this region.\r\n\r\n[The Ægæan Islands.]\r\n\r\nThe settlements of the Ægæan which first raised the flag of Greek\r\nindependence were the so-called Nautical Islands, Hydra, Spetza, and Psara,\r\nwhere the absence of a Turkish population and the enjoyment of a century of\r\nself-government had allowed the bold qualities of an energetic maritime\r\nrace to grow to their full vigour. Hydra and Spetza were close to the Greek\r\ncoast, Psara was on the farther side of the archipelago, almost within view\r\nof Asia Minor; so that in joining the insurrection its inhabitants showed\r\ngreat heroism, for they were exposed to the first attack of any Turkish\r\nforce that could maintain itself for a few hours at sea, and the whole\r\nadjacent mainland was the recruiting-ground of the Sultan. At Hydra the\r\nrevolt against the Ottoman was connected with the internal struggles of the\r\nlittle community, and these in their turn were connected with the great\r\neconomical changes of Europe which, at the opposite end of the continent,\r\nand in a widely different society, led to the enactment of the English Corn\r\nLaws, and to the strife of classes which resulted from them. During\r\nNapoleon's wars the carrying-trade of most nations had become extinct;\r\nlittle corn reached England, and few besides Greek ships navigated the\r\nEuxine and Mediterranean. When peace opened the markets and the ports of\r\nall nations, just as the renewed importation of foreign corn threatened to\r\nlower the profits of English farmers and the rents of English landlords, so\r\nthe reviving freedom of navigation made an end of the monopoly of the\r\nHydriote and Psarian merchantmen. The shipowners formed an oligarchy in\r\nHydra; the captains and crews of their ships, though they shared the\r\nprofits of each voyage, were excluded from any share in the government of\r\nthe island. Failure of trade, want and inactivity, hence led to a political\r\nopposition. The shipowners, wealthy and privileged men, had no inclination\r\nto break with the Turk; the captains and sailors, who had now nothing to\r\nlose, declared for Greek independence. There was a struggle in which for\r\nawhile nothing but the commonest impulses of need and rapacity came into\r\nplay; but the greater cause proved its power: Hydra threw in its lot with\r\nGreece; and although private greed and ill-faith, as well as great cruelty,\r\ntoo often disgraced both the Hydriote crews and those of the other islands,\r\nthe nucleus of a naval force was now formed which made the achievement of\r\nGreek independence possible. The three islands which led the way were soon\r\nfollowed by the wealthier and more populous Samos and by the greater part\r\nof the Archipelago. Crete, inhabited by a mixed Greek and Turkish\r\npopulation, also took up arms, and was for years to come the scene of a\r\nbloody and destructive warfare.\r\n\r\n[The Greek leaders.]\r\n\r\nWithin the Morea the first shock of the revolt had made the Greeks masters\r\nof everything outside the fortified towns. The reduction of these places\r\nwas at once undertaken by the insurgents. Tripolitza, lately the seat of\r\nthe Turkish government, was the centre of operations, and in the\r\nneighbourhood of this town the first provisional government of the Greeks,\r\ncalled the Senate of Kaltesti, was established. Demetrius Hypsilanti, a\r\nbrother of the Hetærist leader, whose failure in Roumania was not yet\r\nknown, landed in the Morea and claimed supreme power. He was tumultuously\r\nwelcomed by the peasant-soldiers, though the Primates, who had hitherto\r\nheld undisputed sway, bore him no good will. Two other men became prominent\r\nat this time as leaders in the Greek war of liberation. These were\r\nMaurokordatos, a descendant of the Hospodars of Wallachia--a politician\r\nsuperior to all his rivals in knowledge and breadth of view, but wanting in\r\nthe faculty of action required by the times--and Kolokotrones, a type of\r\nthe rough fighting Klepht; a mere savage in attainments, scarcely able to\r\nread or write, cunning, grossly avaricious and faithless, incapable of\r\nappreciating either military or moral discipline, but a born soldier in his\r\nown irregular way, and a hero among peasants as ignorant as himself. There\r\nwas yet another, who, if his character had been equal to his station, would\r\nhave been placed at the head of the government of the Morea. This was\r\nPetrobei, chief of the family of Mauromichalis, ruler of the rugged\r\ndistrict of Maina, in the south-west of Peloponnesus, where the Turk had\r\nnever established more than nominal sovereignty. A jovial, princely person,\r\nexercising among his clansmen a mild Homeric sway, Petrobei, surrounded by\r\nhis nine vigorous sons, was the most picturesque figure in Greece. But he\r\nhad no genius for great things. A sovereignty, which in other hands might\r\nhave expanded to national dominion, remained with Petrobei a mere ornament\r\nand curiosity; and the power of the deeply-rooted clan-spirit of the Maina\r\nonly made itself felt when, at a later period, the organisation of a united\r\nHellenic State demanded its sacrifice.\r\n\r\n[Fall of Tripolitza, Oct. 5, 1821.]\r\n\r\nAnarchy, egotism, and ill-faith disgraced the Greek insurrection from its\r\nbeginning to its close. There were, indeed, some men of unblemished honour\r\namong the leaders, and the peasantry in the ranks fought with the most\r\ndetermined courage year after year; but the action of most of those who\r\nfigured as representatives of the people brought discredit upon the\r\nnational cause. Their first successes were accompanied by gross treachery\r\nand cruelty. Had the Greek leaders been Bourbon kings, nurtured in all the\r\nsanctities of divine right, instead of tax-gatherers and cattle-lifters,\r\ntruants from the wild school of Turkish violence and deceit, they could not\r\nhave perjured themselves with lighter hearts. On the surrender of Navarino,\r\nin August, 1821, after a formal capitulation providing for the safety of\r\nits Turkish inhabitants, men, women, and children were indiscriminately\r\nmassacred. The capture of Tripolitza, which took place two months later,\r\nwas changed from a peaceful triumph into a scene of frightful slaughter by\r\nthe avarice of individual chiefs, who, while negotiations were pending,\r\nmade their way into the town, and bargained with rich inhabitants to give\r\nthem protection in return for their money and jewels. The soldiery, who had\r\nundergone the labours of the siege for six months, saw that their reward\r\nwas being pilfered from them. Defying all orders, and in the absence of\r\nDemetrius Hypsilanti, the commander-in-chief, they rushed upon the\r\nfortifications of Tripolitza, and carried them by storm. A general massacre\r\nof the inhabitants followed. For three days the work of carnage was\r\ncontinued in the streets and houses, until few out of a population of many\r\nthousands remained living. According to the testimony of Kolokotrones\r\nhimself, the roads were so choked with the dead, that as he rode from the\r\ngateway to the citadel his horse's hoofs never touched the ground. [368]\r\n\r\n[The Massacre of Chios, April-June, 1822.]\r\n\r\nIn the opening scenes of the Greek insurrection the barbarity of Christians\r\nand of Ottomans was perhaps on a level. The Greek revenged himself with the\r\nferocity of the slave who breaks his fetters; the Turk resorted to\r\nwholesale massacre and extermination as the normal means of government in\r\ntroubled times. And as experience has shown that the savagery of the\r\nEuropean yields in one generation to the influences of civilised rule,\r\nwhile the Turk remains as inhuman to-day as he was under Mahmud II., so the\r\nhistory of 1822 proved that the most devilish passions of the Greek were in\r\nthe end but a poor match for disciplined Turkish prowess in the work of\r\nbutchery. It was no easy matter for the Sultan to requite himself for the\r\nsack of Tripolitza upon Kolokotrones and his victorious soldiers; but there\r\nwas a peaceful and inoffensive population elsewhere, which offered all the\r\nconditions for free, unstinted, and unimperilled vengeance which the Turk\r\ndesires. A body of Samian troops had landed in Chios, and endeavoured, but\r\nwith little success, to excite the inhabitants to revolt, the absence of\r\nthe Greek fleet rendering them an almost certain prey to the Sultan's\r\ntroops on the mainland. The Samian leader nevertheless refused to abandon\r\nthe enterprise, and laid siege to the citadel, in which there was a Turkish\r\ngarrison. Before this fortress could be reduced, a relieving army of seven\r\nthousand Turks, with hosts of fanatical volunteers, landed on the island.\r\nThe Samians fled; the miserable population of Chios was given up to\r\nmassacre. For week after week the soldiery and the roving hordes of\r\nOttomans slew, pillaged, and sold into slavery at their pleasure. In parts\r\nof the island where the inhabitants took refuge in the monasteries, they\r\nwere slaughtered by thousands together; others, tempted back to their homes\r\nby the promulgation of an amnesty, perished family by family. The lot of\r\nthose who were spared was almost more pitiable than of those who died. The\r\nslave-markets of Egypt and Tunis were glutted with Chian captives. The\r\ngentleness, the culture, the moral worth of the Chian community made its\r\nfate the more tragical. No district in Europe had exhibited a civilisation\r\nmore free from the vices of its type: on no community had there fallen in\r\nmodern times so terrible a catastrophe. The estimates of the destruction of\r\nlife at Chios are loosely framed; among the lowest is that which sets the\r\nnumber of the slain and the enslaved at thirty thousand. The island, lately\r\nthronging with life and activity, became a thinly-populated place. After a\r\nlong period of depression and the slow return of some fraction of its\r\nformer prosperity, convulsions of nature have in our own day again made\r\nChios a ruin. A new life may arise when the Turk is no longer master of its\r\nshores, but the old history of Chios is closed for ever.\r\n\r\n[Exploit of Kanaris, June 18th, 1822.]\r\n\r\nThe impression made upon public opinion in Europe by the massacre of 1822\r\nwas a deep and lasting one, although it caused no immediate change in the\r\naction of Governments. The general feeling of sympathy for the Greeks and\r\nhatred for the Turks, which ultimately forced the Governments to take up a\r\ndifferent policy, was intensified by a brilliant deed of daring by which a\r\nGreek captain avenged the Chians upon their devastor, and by the unexpected\r\nsuccess gained by the insurgents on the mainland against powerful armies of\r\nthe Sultan. The Greek executive, which was now headed by Maurokordatos, had\r\nbeen guilty of gross neglect in not sending over the fleet in time to\r\nprevent the Turks from landing in Chios. When once this landing had been\r\neffected, the ships which afterwards arrived were powerless to prevent the\r\nmassacre, and nothing could be attempted except against the Turkish fleet\r\nitself. The instrument of destruction employed by the Greeks was the\r\nfire-ship, which had been used with success against the Turk in these same\r\nwaters in the war of 1770. The sacred month of the Ramazan was closing, and\r\non the night of June 18, Kara Ali, the Turkish commander, celebrated the\r\nfestival of Bairam with above a thousand men on board his flag-ship. The\r\nvessel was illuminated with coloured lanterns. In the midst of the\r\nfestivities, Constantine Kanaris, a Psarian captain, brought his fire-ship\r\nunobserved right up to the Turkish man-of-war, and drove his bowsprit\r\nfirmly into one of her portholes; then, after setting fire to the\r\ncombustibles, he stepped quietly into a row-boat, and made away. A breeze\r\nwas blowing, and in a moment the Turkish crew were enveloped in a mass of\r\nflames. The powder on board exploded; the boats were sunk; and the vessel,\r\nwith its doomed crew, burned to the water-edge, its companions sheering off\r\nto save themselves from the shower of blazing fragments that fell all\r\naround. Kara Ali was killed by a broken mast; a few of his men saved their\r\nlives by swimming or were picked up by rescuers; the rest perished. Such\r\nwas the consternation caused by the deed of Kanaris, that the Ottoman fleet\r\nforthwith quitted the Ægæan waters, and took refuge under the guns of the\r\nDardanelles. Kanaris, unknown before, became from this exploit a famous man\r\nin Europe. It was to no stroke of fortune or mere audacity that he owed his\r\nsuccess, but to the finest combination of nerve and nautical skill. His\r\nfeat, which others were constantly attempting, but with little success, to\r\nimitate, was repeated by him in the same year. He was the most brilliant of\r\nGreek seamen, a simple and modest hero; and after his splendid achievements\r\nin the war of liberation, he served his country well in a political career.\r\nDown to his death in a hale old age, he was with justice the idol and pride\r\nof the Greek nation.\r\n\r\n[Double invasion of Greece 1822.]\r\n\r\n[Destruction of the Philhellenes near Arta, July 16.]\r\n\r\n[Unsuccessful siege of Missolonghi, Nov., 1822.]\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Albanian rebel, Ali Pasha, in the spring of 1822 made it\r\npossible for Sultan Mahmud, who had hitherto been crippled by the\r\nresistance of Janina, to throw his whole land-force against the Hellenic\r\nrevolt; and the Greeks of the mainland, who had as yet had to deal only\r\nwith scattered detachments or isolated garrisons, now found themselves\r\nexposed to the attack of two powerful armies. Kurshid, the conqueror of Ali\r\nPasha, took up his headquarters at Larissa in Thessaly, and from this base\r\nthe two invading armies marched southwards on diverging lines. The first,\r\nunder Omer Brionis, was ordered to make its way through Southern Epirus to\r\nthe western entrance of the Corinthian Gulf, and there to cross into the\r\nMorea; the second, under Dramali, to reduce Central Greece, and enter the\r\nMorea by the isthmus of Corinth; the conquest of Tripolitza and the relief\r\nof the Turkish coast-fortresses which were still uncaptured being the\r\nultimate end to be accomplished by the two armies in combination with one\r\nanother and with the Ottoman fleet. Not less than fifty thousand men were\r\nunder the orders of the Turkish commanders, the division of Dramali being\r\nby far the larger of the two. Against this formidable enemy the Greeks\r\npossessed poor means of defence, nor were their prospects improved when\r\nMaurokordatos, the President, determined to take a military command, and to\r\nplace himself at the head of the troops in Western Greece. There were\r\nindeed urgent reasons for striking with all possible force in this quarter.\r\nThe Suliotes, after seventeen years of exile in Corfu, had returned to\r\ntheir mountains, and were now making common cause with Greece. They were\r\nboth the military outwork of the insurrection, and the political link\r\nbetween the Hellenes and the Christian communities of Albania, whose action\r\nmight become of decisive importance in the struggle against the Turks.\r\nMaurokordatos rightly judged the relief of Suli to be the first and most\r\npressing duty of the Government. Under a capable leader this effort would\r\nnot have been beyond the power of the Greeks; directed by a politician who\r\nknew nothing of military affairs, it was perilous in the highest degree.\r\nMaurokordatos, taking the command out of abler hands, pushed his troops\r\nforward to the neighbourhood of Arta, mismanaged everything, and after\r\ncommitting a most important post to Botzares, an Albanian chieftain of\r\ndoubtful fidelity, left two small regiments exposed to the attack of the\r\nTurks in mass. One of these regiments, called the corps of Philhellenes,\r\nwas composed of foreign officers who had volunteered to serve in the Greek\r\ncause as common soldiers. Its discipline was far superior to anything that\r\nexisted among the Greeks themselves; and at its head were men who had\r\nfought in Napoleon's campaigns. But this corps, which might have become the\r\nnucleus of a regular army, was sacrificed to the incapacity of the general\r\nand the treachery of his confederate. Betrayed and abandoned by the\r\nAlbanian, the Philhellenes met the attack of the Turks gallantly, and\r\nalmost all perished. Maurokordatos and the remnant of the Greek troops now\r\nretired to Missolonghi. The Suliotes, left to their own resources, were\r\nonce more compelled to quit their mountain home, and to take refuge in\r\nCorfu. Their resistance, however, delayed the Turks for some months, and it\r\nwas not until the beginning of November that the army of Omer Brionis,\r\nafter conquering the intermediate territory, appeared in front of\r\nMissolonghi. Here the presence of Maurokordatos produced a better effect\r\nthan in the field. He declared that he would never leave the town as long\r\nas a man remained to fight the Turks. Defences were erected, and the\r\nbesiegers kept at bay for two months. On the 6th of January, 1823, Brionis\r\nordered an assault. It was beaten back with heavy loss; and the Ottoman\r\ncommander, hopeless of maintaining his position throughout the winter,\r\nabandoned his artillery, and retired into the interior of the country.\r\n[369]\r\n\r\n[Dramali passes the Isthmus of Corinth, July 1822.]\r\n\r\n[His retreat and destruction, Aug., 1822.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Dramali had advanced from Thessaly with twenty-four\r\nthousand infantry and six thousand cavalry, the most formidable armament\r\nthat had been seen in Greece since the final struggle between the Turks and\r\nVenetians in 1715. At the terror of his approach all hopes of resistance\r\nvanished. He marched through Boeotia and Attica, devastating the country,\r\nand reached the isthmus of Corinth in July, 1822. The mountain passes were\r\nabandoned by the Greeks; the Government, whose seat was at Argos,\r\ndispersed; and Dramali moved on to Nauplia, where the Turkish garrison was\r\non the point of surrendering to the Greeks. The entrance to the Morea had\r\nbeen won; the very shadow of a Greek government had disappeared, and the\r\ndefinite suppression of the revolt seemed now to be close at hand. But two\r\nfatal errors of the enemy saved the Greek cause. Dramali neglected to\r\ngarrison the passes through which he had advanced; and the commander of the\r\nOttoman fleet, which ought to have met the land-force at Nauplia, disobeyed\r\nhis instructions and sailed on to Patras. Two Greeks, at this crisis of\r\ntheir country's history, proved themselves equal to the call of events.\r\nDemetrius Hypsilanti, now President of the Legislature, refused to fly with\r\nhis colleagues, and threw himself, with a few hundred men, into the\r\nAcropolis of Argos. Kolokotrones, hastening to Tripolitza, called out every\r\nman capable of bearing arms, and hurried back to Argos, where the Turks\r\nwere still held at bay by the defenders of the citadel. Dramali could no\r\nlonger think of marching into the interior of the Morea. The gallantry of\r\nDemetrius had given time for the assemblage of a considerable force, and\r\nthe Ottoman general now discovered the ruinous effect of his neglect to\r\ngarrison the passes in his rear. These were seized by Kolokotrones. The\r\nsummer-drought threatened the Turkish army with famine; the fleet which\r\nwould have rendered them independent of land-supplies was a hundred miles\r\naway; and Dramali, who had lately seen all Greece at his feet, now found\r\nhimself compelled to force his way back through the enemy to the isthmus of\r\nCorinth. The measures taken by Kolokotrones to intercept his retreat were\r\nskilfully planned, and had they been adequately executed not a man of the\r\nOttoman army would have escaped. It was only through the disorder and the\r\ncupidity of the Greeks themselves that a portion of Dramali's force\r\nsucceeded in cutting its way back to Corinth. Baggage was plundered while\r\nthe retreating enemy ought to have been annihilated, and divisions which\r\nought to have co-operated in the main attack sought trifling successes of\r\ntheir own. But the losses and the demoralisation of the Turkish army were\r\nas ruinous to it as total destruction. Dramali himself fell ill and died;\r\nand the remnant of his troops which had escaped from the enemy's hands\r\nperished in the neighbourhood of Corinth from sickness and want.\r\n\r\n[Greek Civil Wars, 1824.]\r\n\r\nThe decisive events of 1822 opened the eyes of European Governments to the\r\nreal character of the Greek national rising, and to the probability of its\r\nultimate success. The forces of Turkey were exhausted for the moment, and\r\nduring the succeeding year no military operations could be undertaken by\r\nthe Sultan on anything like the same scale. It would perhaps have been\r\nbetter for the Greeks themselves if the struggle had been more continuously\r\nsustained. Nothing but foreign pressure could give unity to the efforts of\r\na race distracted by so many local rivalries, and so many personal\r\nambitions and animosities. Scarcely was the extremity of danger passed when\r\ncivil war began among the Greeks themselves. Kolokotrones set himself up in\r\nopposition to the Legislature, and seized on some of the strong places in\r\nthe Morea. This first outbreak of the so-called military party against the\r\ncivil authorities was, however, of no great importance. The Primates of the\r\nMorea took part with the representatives of the islands and of Central\r\nGreece against the disturber of the peace, and an accommodation was soon\r\narranged. Konduriottes, a rich ship-owner of Hydra, was made President,\r\nwith Kolettes, a politician of great influence in Central Greece, as his\r\nMinister. But in place of the earlier antagonism between soldier and\r\ncivilian, a new and more dangerous antagonism, that of district against\r\ndistrict, now threatened the existence of Greece. The tendency of the new\r\ngovernment to sacrifice everything to the interest of the islands at once\r\nbecame evident. Konduriottes was a thoroughly incompetent man, and made\r\nhimself ridiculous by appointing his friends, the Hydriote sea-captains, to\r\nthe highest military and civil posts. Rebellion again broke out, and\r\nKolokotrones was joined by his old antagonists, the Primates of the Morea.\r\nA serious struggle ensued, and the government, which was really conducted\r\nby Kolettes, displayed an energy that surprised both its friends and its\r\nfoes. The Morea was invaded by a powerful force from Hydra. No mercy was\r\nshown to the districts which supported the rebels. Kolokotrones was\r\nthoroughly defeated, and compelled to give himself up to the Government. He\r\nwas carried to Hydra and thrown into prison, where he remained until new\r\nperil again rendered his services indispensable to Greece.\r\n\r\n[Mahmud calls for the help of Egypt.]\r\n\r\nAfter the destruction of Dramali's army and the failure of the Ottoman navy\r\nto effect any result whatever, the Sultan appears to have conceived a doubt\r\nwhether the subjugation of Greece might not in fact be a task beyond his\r\nown unaided power. Even if the mainland were conquered, it was certain that\r\nthe Turkish fleet could never reduce the islands, nor prevent the passage\r\nof supplies and reinforcements from these to the ports of the Morea.\r\nStrenuous as Mahmud had hitherto shown himself in crushing his vassals who,\r\nlike Ali Pasha, attempted to establish an authority independent of the\r\ncentral government, he now found himself compelled to apply to the most\r\ndangerous of them all for assistance. Mehemet Ali, Pasha of Egypt, had\r\nrisen to power in the disturbed time that followed the expulsion of\r\nNapoleon's forces from Egypt. His fleet was more powerful than that of\r\nTurkey. He had organised an army composed of Arabs, negroes, and fellahs,\r\nand had introduced into it, by means of French officers, the military\r\nsystem and discipline of Europe. The same reform had been attempted in\r\nTurkey seventeen years before by Mahmud's predecessor, Selim III., but it\r\nhad been successfully resisted by the soldiery of Constantinople, and Selim\r\nhad paid for his innovations with his life. Mahmud, silent and tenacious,\r\nhad long been planning the destruction of the Janissaries, the mutinous and\r\ndegraded representatives of a once irresistible force, who would now\r\nneither fight themselves nor permit their rulers to organise any more\r\neffective body of troops in their stead. It is possible that the Sultan may\r\nhave believed that a victory won over the enemies of Islam by the\r\nre-modelled forces of Egypt would facilitate the execution of his own plans\r\nof military reform; it is also possible that he may not have been unwilling\r\nto see his vassal's resources dissipated by a distant and hazardous\r\nenterprise. Not without some profound conviction of the urgency of the\r\npresent need, not without some sinister calculation as to the means of\r\ndealing with an eventual rival in the future, was the offer of\r\naggrandisement--if we may judge from the whole tenor of Sultan Mahmud's\r\ncareer and policy--made to the Pasha of Egypt by his jealous and far-seeing\r\nmaster. The Pasha was invited to assume the supreme command of the Ottoman\r\nforces by land and sea, and was promised the island of Crete in return for\r\nhis co-operation against the Hellenic revolt. Messages to this effect\r\nreached Alexandria at the beginning of 1824. Mehemet, whose ambition had no\r\nlimits, welcomed the proposals of his sovereign with ardour, and, while\r\ndeclining the command for himself, accepted it on behalf of Ibrahim, his\r\nadopted son.\r\n\r\n[Turkish-Egyptian plans.]\r\n\r\n[Egyptians conquer Crete, April, 1824.]\r\n\r\n[Destruction of Psara, July, 1824.]\r\n\r\nThe most vigorous preparations for war were now made at Alexandria. The\r\narmy was raised to 90,000 men, and new ships were added to the navy from\r\nEnglish dockyards. A scheme was framed for the combined operation of the\r\nEgyptian and the Turkish forces which appeared to render the ultimate\r\nconquest of Greece certain. It was agreed that the island of Crete, which\r\nis not sixty miles distant from the southern extremity of the Morea, should\r\nbe occupied by Ibrahim, and employed as his place of arms; that\r\nsimultaneous or joint attacks should then be made upon the principal\r\nislands of the Ægæan; and that after the capture of these strongholds and\r\nthe destruction of the maritime resources of the Greeks, Ibrahim's troops\r\nshould pass over the narrow sea between Crete and the Morea, and complete\r\ntheir work by the reduction of the mainland, thus left destitute of all\r\nchance of succour from without. Crete, like Sicily, is a natural\r\nstepping-stone between Europe and Africa; and when once the assistance of\r\nEgypt was invoked by the Sultan, it was obvious that Crete became the\r\nposition which above all others it was necessary for the Greeks to watch\r\nand to defend. But the wretched Government of Konduriottes was occupied\r\nwith its domestic struggles. The appeal of the Cretans for protection\r\nremained unanswered, and in the spring of 1824 a strong Egyptian force\r\nlanded on this island, captured its fortresses, and suppressed the\r\nresistance of the inhabitants with the most frightful cruelty. The base of\r\noperations had been won, and the combined attacks of the Egyptian and\r\nTurkish fleets upon the smaller islands followed. Casos, about thirty miles\r\neast of Crete, was surprised by the Egyptians, and its population\r\nexterminated. Psara was selected for the attack of the Turkish fleet. Since\r\nthe beginning of the insurrection the Psariotes had been the scourge and\r\nterror of the Ottoman coasts. The services that they had rendered in the\r\nGreek navy had been priceless; and if there was one spot of Greek soil\r\nwhich ought to have been protected as long as a single boat's crew remained\r\nafloat, it was the little rock of Psara. Yet, in spite of repeated\r\nwarnings, the Greek Government allowed the Turkish fleet to pass the\r\nDardanelles unobserved, and some clumsy feints were enough to blind it to\r\nthe real object of an expedition whose aim was known to all Europe. There\r\nwere ample means for succouring the islanders, as subsequent events proved;\r\nbut when the Turkish admiral, Khosrew, with 10,000 men on board, appeared\r\nbefore Psara, the Greek fleet was far away. The Psariotes themselves were\r\nover-confident. They trusted to their batteries on land, and believed their\r\nrocks to be impregnable. They were soon undeceived. While a corps of\r\nAlbanians scaled the cliffs behind the town, the Turks gained a footing in\r\nfront, and overwhelmed their gallant enemy by weight of numbers. No mercy\r\nwas asked or given. Eight thousand of the Psarians were slain or carried\r\naway as slaves. Not more than one-third of the population succeeded in\r\nescaping to the neighbouring islands. [370]\r\n\r\n[Greek successes off the coast of Asia Minor, September, 1824.]\r\n\r\n[Ibrahim reaches Crete. December, 1824.]\r\n\r\nThe first part of the Turko-Egyptian plan had thus been successfully\r\naccomplished, and if Khosrew had attacked Samos immediately after his first\r\nvictory, this island would probably have fallen before help could arrive.\r\nBut, like other Turkish commanders, Khosrew loved intervals of repose, and\r\nhe now sailed off to Mytilene to celebrate the festival of Bairam. In the\r\nmeantime the catastrophe of Psara had aroused the Hydriote Government to a\r\nsense of its danger. A strong fleet was sent across the Ægæan, and adequate\r\nmeasures were taken to defend Samos both by land and sea. The Turkish fleet\r\nwas attacked with some success, and though Ibrahim with the Egyptian\r\ncontingent now reached the coast of Asia Minor, the Greeks proved\r\nthemselves superior to their adversaries combined. The operations of the\r\nMussulman commanders led to no result; they were harassed and terrified by\r\nthe Greek fireships; and when at length all hope of a joint conquest of\r\nSamos had been abandoned, and Ibrahim set sail for Crete to carry out his\r\nown final enterprise alone, he was met on the high seas by the Greeks, and\r\ndriven back to the coast of Asia Minor. During the autumn of 1824 the\r\ndisasters of the preceding months were to some extent retrieved, and the\r\nsituation of the Egyptian fleet would have become one of some peril if the\r\nGreeks had maintained their guard throughout the winter. But they\r\nunderrated the energy of Ibrahim, and surrendered themselves to the belief\r\nthat he would not repeat the attempt to reach Crete until the following\r\nspring. Careless, or deluded by false information, they returned to Hydra,\r\nand left the seas unwatched. Ibrahim saw his opportunity, and, setting sail\r\nfor Crete at the beginning of December, he reached it without falling in\r\nwith the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Ibrahim in the Morea, Feb., 1825.]\r\n\r\nThe snowy heights of Taygetus are visible on a clear winter's day from the\r\nCretan coast; yet, with their enemy actually in view of them, the Greeks\r\nneglected to guard the passage to the Morea. On the 22nd of February, 1825,\r\nIbrahim crossed the sea unopposed and landed five thousand men at Modon. He\r\nwas even able to return to Crete and bring over a second contingent of\r\nsuperior strength before any steps were taken to hinder his movements. The\r\nfate of the mainland was now settled. Ibrahim marched from Modon upon\r\nNavarino, defeated the Greek forces on the way, and captured the garrison\r\nplaced in the Island of Sphakteria--the scene of the first famous surrender\r\nof the Spartans--before the Greek fleet could arrive to relieve it. The\r\nforts of Navarino then capitulated, and Ibrahim pushed on his victorious\r\nmarch towards the centre of the Morea. It was in vain that the old chief\r\nKolokotrones was brought from his prison at Hydra to take supreme command.\r\nThe conqueror of Dramali was unable to resist the onslaught of Ibrahim's\r\nregiments, recruited from the fierce races of the Soudan, and fighting\r\nwith the same arms and under the same discipline as the best troops in\r\nEurope. Kolokotrones was driven back through Tripolitza, and retired as the\r\nRussians had retired from Moscow, leaving a deserted capital behind him.\r\nIbrahim gave his troops no rest; he hurried onwards against Nauplia, and on\r\nthe 24th of June reached the summit of the mountain-pass that looks down\r\nupon the Argolic Gulf. \"Ah, little island,\" he cried, as he saw the rock of\r\nHydra stretched below him, \"how long wilt thou escape me?\" At Nauplia\r\nitself the Egyptian commander rode up to the very gates and scanned the\r\ndefences, which he hoped to carry at the first assault. Here, however, a\r\ncheck awaited him. In the midst of general flight and panic, Demetrius\r\nHypsilanti was again the undaunted soldier. He threw himself with some few\r\nhundreds of men into the mills of Lerna, and there beat back Ibrahim's\r\nvanguard when it attempted to carry this post by storm. The Egyptian\r\nrecognised that with men like these in front of him Nauplia could be\r\nreduced only by a regular siege. He retired for a while upon Tripolitza,\r\nand thence sent out his harrying columns, slaughtering and devastating in\r\nevery direction. It seemed to be his design not merely to exhaust the\r\nresources of his enemy but to render the Morea a desert, and to exterminate\r\nits population. In the very birthplace of European civilisation, it was\r\nsaid, this savage, who had already been nominated Pasha of the Morea,\r\nintended to extinguish the European race and name, and to found for himself\r\nupon the ashes of Greece a new barbaric state composed of African negroes\r\nand fellaheen. That such design had actually been formed was denied by the\r\nTurkish government in answer to official inquiries, and its existence was\r\nnot capable of proof. But the brutality of one age is the stupidity of the\r\nnext, and Ibrahim's violence recoiled upon himself. Nothing in the whole\r\nstruggle between the Sultan and the Greeks gave so irresistible an argument\r\nto the Philhellenes throughout Europe, or so directly overcame the scruples\r\nof Governments in regard to an armed intervention in favour of Greece, as\r\nIbrahim's alleged policy of extermination and re-settlement. The days were\r\npast when Europe could permit its weakest member to be torn from it and\r\nadded to the Mohammedan world.\r\n\r\n[Siege of Missolonghi, April, 1825-April, 1826.]\r\n\r\nOne episode of the deepest tragic interest yet remained in the\r\nTurko-Hellenic conflict before the Powers of Europe stepped in and struck\r\nwith weapons stronger than those which had fallen from dying hands. The\r\ntown of Missolonghi was now beleaguered by the Turks, who had invaded\r\nWestern Greece while Ibrahim was overrunning the Morea. Missolonghi had\r\nalready once been besieged without success; and, as in the case of\r\nSaragossa, the first deliverance appears to have inspired the townspeople\r\nwith the resolution, maintained even more heroically at Missolonghi than at\r\nthe Spanish city, to die rather than capitulate. From the time when\r\nReschid, the Turkish commander, opened the second attack by land and sea in\r\nthe spring of 1825, the garrison and the inhabitants met every movement of\r\nthe enemy with the most obstinate resistance. It was in vain that Reschid\r\nbroke through the defences with his artillery, and threw mass after mass\r\nupon the breaches which he made. For month after month the assaults of the\r\nTurks were uniformly repelled, until at length the arrival of a Hydriote\r\nsquadron forced the Turkish fleet to retire from its position, and made the\r\nsituation of Reschid himself one of considerable danger. And now, as winter\r\napproached, and the guerilla bands in the rear of the besiegers grew more\r\nand more active, the Egyptian army with its leader was called from the\r\nMorea to carry out the task in which the Turks had failed. The Hydriote\r\nsea-captains had departed, believing their presence to be no longer needed;\r\nand although they subsequently returned for a short time, their services\r\nwere grudgingly rendered and ineffective. Ibrahim, settling down to his\r\nwork at the beginning of 1826, conducted his operations with the utmost\r\nvigour, boasting that he would accomplish in fourteen days what the Turks\r\ncould not effect in nine months. But his veteran soldiers were thoroughly\r\ndefeated when they met the Greeks hand to hand; and the Egyptian, furious\r\nwith his enemy, his allies, and his own officers, confessed that\r\nMissolonghi could only be taken by blockade. He now ordered a fleet of\r\nflat-bottomed boats to be constructed and launched upon the lagoons that\r\nlie between Missolonghi and the open sea. Missolonghi was thus completely\r\nsurrounded; and when the Greek admirals appeared for the last time and\r\nendeavoured to force an entrance through the shallows, they found the\r\nbesieger in full command of waters inaccessible to themselves, and after\r\none unsuccessful effort abandoned Missolonghi to its fate. In the third\r\nweek of April, 1826, exactly a year after the commencement of the siege,\r\nthe supply of food was exhausted. The resolution, long made, that the\r\nentire population, men, women, and children, should fall by the enemy's\r\nsword rather than surrender, was now actually carried out. On the night of\r\nthe 22nd of April all the Missolonghiots, with the exception of those whom\r\nage, exhaustion, or illness made unable to leave their homes, were drawn up\r\nin bands at the city gates, the women armed and dressed as men, the\r\nchildren carrying pistols. Preceded by a body of soldiers, they crossed the\r\nmoat under Turkish fire. The attack of the vanguard carried everything\r\nbefore it, and a way was cut through the Turkish lines. But at this moment\r\nsome cry of confusion was mistaken by those who were still on the bridges\r\nfor an order to retreat. A portion of the non-combatants returned into the\r\ntown, and with them the rearguard of the military escort. The leading\r\ndivisions, however, continued their march forward, and would have escaped\r\nwith the loss of some of the women and children, had not treachery already\r\nmade the Turkish commander acquainted with the routes which they intended\r\nto follow. They had cleared the Turkish camp, and were expecting to meet\r\nthe bands of Greek armatoli, who had promised to fall upon the enemy's\r\nrear, when, instead of friends, they encountered troop after troop of\r\nOttoman cavalry and of Albanians placed in ambush along the road between\r\nMissolonghi and the mountains. Here, exhausted and surprised, they were cut\r\ndown without mercy, and out of a body numbering several thousand not more\r\nthan fifteen hundred men, with a few women and children, ultimately reached\r\nplaces of safety. Missolonghi itself was entered by the Turks during the\r\nsortie. The soldiers who had fallen back during the confusion on the\r\nbridges, proved that they had not acted from cowardice. They fought\r\nunflinchingly to the last, and three bands, establishing themselves in the\r\nthree powder magazines of the town, set fire to them when surrounded by the\r\nTurks, and perished in the explosion Some thousands of women and children\r\nwere captured around and within the town, or wandering on the mountains;\r\nbut the Turks had few other prisoners. The men were dead or free.\r\n\r\n[Fall of the Acropolis of Athens, June 5, 1827.]\r\n\r\nFrom Missolonghi the tide of Ottoman conquest rolled eastward, and the\r\nAcropolis of Athens was in its turn the object of a long and arduous siege.\r\nThe Government, which now held scarcely any territory on the mainland\r\nexcept Nauplia, where it was itself threatened by Ibrahim, made the most\r\nvigorous efforts to prevent the Acropolis from falling into Reschid's\r\nhands. All, however, was in vain. The English officers, Church and\r\nCochrane, who were now placed at the head of the military and naval forces\r\nof Greece, failed ignominiously in the attacks which they made on Reschid's\r\nbesieging army; and the garrison capitulated on June 5, 1827. But the time\r\nwas past when the liberation of Greece could be prevented by any Ottoman\r\nvictory. The heroic defence of the Missolonghiots had achieved its end.\r\nGreece had fought long enough to enlist the Powers of Europe on its side;\r\nand in the same month that Missolonghi fell the policy of non-intervention\r\nwas definitely abandoned by those Governments which were best able to carry\r\ntheir intentions into effect. If the struggle had ended during the first\r\nthree years of the insurrection, no hand would have been raised to prevent\r\nthe restoration of the Sultan's rule. Russia then lay as if spell-bound\r\nbeneath the diplomacy of the Holy Alliance; and although in the second year\r\nof the war the death of Castlereagh and the accession of Canning to power\r\nhad given Greece a powerful friend instead of a powerful foe within the\r\nBritish Ministry, it was long before England stirred from its neutrality.\r\nCanning indeed made no secret of his sympathies for Greece, and of his\r\ndesire to give the weaker belligerent such help as a neutral might afford;\r\nbut when he took up office the time had not come when intervention would\r\nhave been useful or possible. Changes in the policy of other great Powers\r\nand in the situation of the belligerents themselves were, he considered,\r\nnecessary before the influence of England could be successfully employed in\r\nestablishing peace in the East.\r\n\r\n[First Russian project of joint intervention, 12 Jan., 1824.]\r\n\r\nA vigorous movement of public opinion in favour of Greece made itself felt\r\nthroughout Western Europe as the struggle continued; and the vivid and\r\nromantic interest excited over the whole civilised world by the death of\r\nLord Byron in 1823, among the people whom he had come to free, probably\r\nserved the Greek cause better than all that Byron could have achieved had\r\nhis life been prolonged. In France and England, where public opinion had\r\ngreat influence on the action of the Government, as well as in Germany,\r\nwhere it had none whatever, societies were formed for assisting the Greeks\r\nwith arms, stores, and money. The first proposal, however, for a joint\r\nintervention in favour of Greece came from St. Petersburg. The undisguised\r\ngood-will of Canning towards the insurgents led the Czar's Government to\r\nanticipate that England itself might soon assume that championship of the\r\nGreek cause which Russia, at the bidding of Metternich and of Canning's\r\npredecessor, had up to that time declined. If the Greeks were to be\r\nbefriended, it was intolerable that others should play the part of the\r\npatron. Accordingly, on the 12th of January, 1824, a note was submitted in\r\nthe Czar's name to all the Courts of Europe, containing a plan for a\r\nsettlement of the Greek question, which it was proposed that the great\r\nPowers of Europe should enforce upon Turkey either by means of an armed\r\ndemonstration or by the threat of breaking off all diplomatic relations.\r\nAccording to this scheme, Greece, apart from the islands, was to be divided\r\ninto three Principalities, each tributary to the Sultan and garrisoned by\r\nTurkish troops, but in other respects autonomous, like the Principalities\r\nof Moldavia and Wallachia. The islands were to retain their municipal\r\norganisation as before. In one respect this scheme was superior to all that\r\nhave succeeded it, for it included in the territory of the Greeks both\r\nCrete and Epirus; in all other respects it was framed in the interest of\r\nRussia alone. Its object was simply to create a second group of provinces,\r\nlike those on the Danube, which should afford Russia a constant opportunity\r\nfor interfering with the Ottoman Empire, and which at the same time should\r\nprevent the Greeks from establishing an independent and self-supporting\r\nState. The design cannot be called insidious, for its object was so\r\npalpable that not a single politician in Europe was deceived by it; and a\r\nvery simple ruse of Metternich's was enough to draw from the Russian\r\nGovernment an explicit declaration against the independence of Greece,\r\nwhich was described by the Czar as a mere chimera. But of all the parties\r\nconcerned, the Greeks themselves were loudest in denounciation of the\r\nRussian plan. Their Government sent a protest against it to London, and was\r\nassured by Canning in reply that the support of this country should never\r\nbe given to any scheme for disposing of the Greeks without their own\r\nconsent. Elsewhere the Czar's note was received with expressions of\r\npoliteness due to a Court which it might be dangerous to contradict; and a\r\nseries of conferences was opened at St. Petersburg for the purpose of\r\ndiscussing propositions which no one intended to carry into execution.\r\nThough Canning ordered the British ambassador at St. Petersburg to\r\ndissociate himself from these proceedings, the conferences dragged on, with\r\nlong adjournments, from the spring of 1824 to the summer of the following\r\nyear. [371]\r\n\r\n[Discontent and conspiracies in Russia.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a strong spirit of discontent was rising in the Russian\r\narmy and nation. The religious feeling no less than the pride of the people\r\nwas deeply wounded by Alexander's refusal to aid the Greeks in their\r\nstruggle, and by the pitiful results of his attempted diplomatic concert.\r\nAlone among the European nations the Russians understood the ecclesiastical\r\ncharacter of the Greek insurrection, and owed nothing of their sympathy\r\nwith it to the spell of classical literature and art. It is characteristic\r\nof the strength of the religious element in the political views of the\r\nRussian people, that the floods of the Neva which overwhelmed St.\r\nPetersburg in the winter of 1825 should have been regarded as a sign of\r\ndivine anger at the Czar's inaction in the struggle between the Crescent\r\nand the Cross. But other causes of discontent were not wanting in Russia.\r\nThough Alexander had forgotten his promises to introduce constitutional\r\nrule, there were many, especially in the army, who had not done so.\r\nOfficers who served in the invasion of France in 1815, and in the three\r\nyears' occupation which followed it, returned from Western Europe with\r\nideas of social progress and of constitutional rights which they could\r\nnever have gathered in their own country. And when the bright hopes which\r\nhad been excited by the recognition of these same ideas by the Czar passed\r\naway, and Russia settled down into the routine of despotism and corruption,\r\nthe old unquestioning loyalty of the army was no longer proof against the\r\nworkings of the revolutionary spirit. In a land where legal means of\r\nopposition to government and of the initiation of reform were wholly\r\nwanting, discontent was forced into its most dangerous form, that of\r\nmilitary conspiracy. The army was honeycombed with secret societies. Both\r\nin the north and in the south of Russia men of influence worked among the\r\nyounger officers, and gained a strong body of adherents to their design of\r\nestablishing a constitution by force. The southern army contained the most\r\nresolute and daring conspirators. These men had definitely abandoned the\r\nhope of effecting any public reform as long as Alexander lived, and they\r\ndetermined to sacrifice the sovereign, as his father and others before him\r\nhad been sacrificed, to the political necessities of the time. If the\r\nevidence subsequently given by those implicated in the conspiracy is worthy\r\nof credit, a definite plan had been formed for the assassination of the\r\nCzar in the presence of his troops at one of the great reviews intended to\r\nbe held in the south of Russia in the autumn of 1825. On the death of the\r\nmonarch a provisional government was at once to be established, and a\r\nconstitution proclaimed.\r\n\r\n[Death of the Czar, Dec. 1, 1825.]\r\n\r\nAlexander, aware of the rising indignation of his people, and irritated\r\nbeyond endurance by the failure of his diplomatic efforts, had dissolved\r\nthe St. Petersburg Conferences in August, 1825, and declared that Russia\r\nwould henceforth act according to its own discretion. He quitted St.\r\nPetersburg and travelled to the Black Sea, accompanied by some of the\r\nleaders of the war-party. Here, plunged in a profound melancholy, conscious\r\nthat all his early hopes had only served to surround him with conspirators,\r\nand that his sacrifice of Russia's military interests to international\r\npeace had only rendered his country impotent before all Europe, he still\r\nhesitated to make the final determination between peace and war. A certain\r\nmystery hung over his movements, his acts, and his intentions. Suddenly,\r\nwhile all Europe waited for the signal that should end the interval of\r\nsuspense, the news was sent out from a lonely port on the Black Sea that\r\nthe Czar was dead. Alexander, still under fifty years of age, had welcomed\r\nthe illness which carried him from a world of cares, and closed a career in\r\nwhich anguish and disappointment had succeeded to such intoxicating glory\r\nand such unbounded hope. Young as he still was for one who had reigned\r\ntwenty-four years, Alexander was of all men the most life-weary. Power,\r\npleasure, excitement, had lavished on him hours of such existence as none\r\nbut Napoleon among all his contemporaries had enjoyed. They had left him\r\nnothing but the solace of religious resignation, and the belief that a\r\nPower higher than his own might yet fulfil the purposes in which he himself\r\nhad failed. Ever in the midst of great acts and great events, he had missed\r\ngreatness himself. Where he had been best was exactly where men inferior to\r\nhimself considered him to have been worst--in his hopes; and these hopes he\r\nhad himself abandoned and renounced. Strength, insight, unity of purpose,\r\nthe qualities which enable men to mould events, appeared in him but\r\nmomentarily or in semblance. For want of them the large and fair horizon of\r\nhis earlier years was first obscured and then wholly blotted out from his\r\nview, till in the end nothing but his pietism and his generosity\r\ndistinguished him from the politicians of repression whose instrument he\r\nhad become.\r\n\r\n[Military insurrection at St. Petersburg, Dec 26, 1825.]\r\n\r\nThe sudden death of Alexander threw the Russian Court into the greatest\r\nconfusion, for it was not known who was to succeed him. The heir to the\r\nthrone was his brother Constantine, an ignorant and brutal savage, who had\r\njust sufficient sense not to desire to be Czar of Russia, though he\r\nconsidered himself good enough to tyrannise over the Poles. Constantine had\r\nrenounced his right to the crown some years before, but the renunciation\r\nhad not been made public, nor had the Grand Duke Nicholas, Constantine's\r\nyounger brother, been made aware that the succession was irrevocably fixed\r\nupon himself. Accordingly, when the news of Alexander's death reached St.\r\nPetersburg, and the document embodying Constantine's abdication was brought\r\nfrom the archives by the officials to whose keeping it had been entrusted,\r\nNicholas refused to acknowledge it as binding, and caused the troops to\r\ntake the oath of allegiance to Constantine, who was then at Warsaw.\r\nConstantine, on the other hand, proclaimed his brother emperor. An\r\ninterregnum of three weeks followed, during which messages passed between\r\nWarsaw and St. Petersburg, Nicholas positively refusing to accept the crown\r\nunless by his elder brother's direct command. This at length arrived, and\r\non the 26th of December Nicholas assumed the rank of sovereign. But the\r\ninterval of uncertainty had been turned to good account by the conspirators\r\nat St. Petersburg. The oath already taken by the soldiers to Constantine\r\nenabled the officers who were concerned in the plot to denounce Nicholas as\r\na usurper, and to disguise their real designs under the cloak of loyalty to\r\nthe legitimate Czar. Ignorant of the very meaning of a constitution, the\r\ncommon soldiers mutinied because they were told to do so; and it is said\r\nthat they shouted the word Constitution, believing it to be the name of\r\nConstantine's wife. When summoned to take the oath to Nicholas, the Moscow\r\nRegiment refused it, and marched off to the place in front of the Senate\r\nHouse, where it formed square, and repulsed an attack made upon it by the\r\nCavalry of the Guard. Companies from other regiments now joined the\r\nmutineers, and symptoms of insurrection began to show themselves among the\r\ncivil population. Nicholas himself did not display the energy of character\r\nwhich distinguished him through all his later life; on the contrary, his\r\nattitude was for some time rather that of resignation than of\r\nself-confidence. Whether some doubt as to the justice of his cause haunted\r\nhim, or a trial like that to which he was now exposed was necessary to\r\nbring to its full strength the iron quality of his nature, it is certain\r\nthat the conduct of the new Czar during these critical hours gave to those\r\naround him little indication of the indomitable will which was hence forth\r\nto govern Russia. Though the great mass of the army remained obedient, it\r\nwas but slowly brought up to the scene of revolt. Officers of high rank\r\nwere sent to harangue the insurgents, and one of these, General\r\nMiloradovitsch, a veteran of the Napoleonic campaigns, was mortally wounded\r\nwhile endeavouring to make himself heard. It was not until evening that the\r\nartillery was ordered into action, and the command given by the Czar to\r\nfire grape-shot among the insurgents. The effect was decisive. The\r\nmutineers fled before a fire which they were unable to return, and within a\r\nfew minutes the insurrection was over. It had possessed no chief of any\r\nmilitary capacity; its leaders were missing at the moment when a forward\r\nmarch or an attack on the palace of the Czar might have given them the\r\nvictory; and among the soldiers at large there was not the least desire to\r\ntake part in any movement against the established system of Russia. The\r\nonly effect left by the conspiracy within Russia itself was seen in the\r\nrigorous and uncompromising severity with which Nicholas henceforward\r\nenforced the principle of autocratic rule. The illusions of the previous\r\nreign were at an end. A man with the education and the ideas of a\r\ndrill-sergeant and the religious assurance of a Covenanter was on the\r\nthrone; rebellion had done its worst against him; and woe to those who in\r\nfuture should deviate a hair's breadth from their duty of implicit\r\nobedience to the sovereign's all-sufficing power. [372]\r\n\r\n[Anglo-Russian Protocol, April 4, 1826.]\r\n\r\nIt has been stated, and with some probability of truth, that the military\r\ninsurrection of 1825 disposed the new Czar to a more vigorous policy\r\nabroad. The conspirators, when on their trial, declared it to have been\r\ntheir intention to throw the army at once into an attack upon the Turks;\r\nand in so doing they would certainly have had the feeling of the nation on\r\ntheir side. Nicholas himself had little or no sympathy for the Greeks. They\r\nwere a democratic people, and the freedom which they sought to gain was\r\nnothing but anarchy. \"Do not speak of the Greeks,\" he said to the\r\nrepresentative of a foreign power, \"I call them the rebels.\" Nevertheless,\r\nlittle as Nicholas wished to serve the Greek democracy, both inclination\r\nand policy urged him to make an end of his predecessor's faint-hearted\r\nsystem of negotiation, and to bring the struggle in the East to a summary\r\nclose. Canning had already, in conversation with the Russian ambassador at\r\nLondon, discussed a possible change of policy on the part of the two rival\r\nCourts. He now saw that time had come for establishing new relations\r\nbetween Great Britain and Russia, and for attempting that co-operation in\r\nthe East which he had held to be impracticable during Alexander's reign.\r\nThe Duke of Wellington was sent to St. Petersburg, nominally to offer the\r\nusual congratulations to the new sovereign, in reality to dissuade him from\r\ngoing to war, and to propose either the separate intervention of England or\r\na joint intervention by England and Russia on behalf of Greece. The mission\r\nwas successful. It was in vain that Metternich endeavoured to entangle the\r\nnew Czar in the diplomatic web that had so long held his predecessor. The\r\nspell of the Holy Alliance was broken. Nicholas looked on the past\r\ninfluence of Austria on the Eastern Question only with resentment; he would\r\nhear of no more conferences of ambassadors; and on the 4th of April, 1826,\r\na Protocol was signed at St. Petersburg, by which Great Britain and Russia\r\nfixed the conditions under which the mediation of the former Power was to\r\nbe tendered to the Porte. Greece was to remain tributary to the Sultan; it\r\nwas, however, to be governed by its own elected authorities, and to be\r\ncompletely independent in its commercial relations. The policy known in our\r\nown day as that of bag-and-baggage expulsion was to be carried out in a far\r\nmore extended sense than that in which it has been advocated by more recent\r\nchampions of the subject races of the East; the Protocol of 1826\r\nstipulating for the removal not only of Turkish officials but of the entire\r\nsurviving Turkish population of Greece. All property belonging to the\r\nTurks, whether on the continent or in the islands, was to be purchased by\r\nthe Greeks. [373]\r\n\r\nThus was the first step taken in the negotiations which ended in the\r\nestablishment of Hellenic independence. The Protocol, which had been\r\nsecretly signed, was submitted after some interval to the other Courts of\r\nEurope. At Vienna it was received with the utmost disgust. Metternich had\r\nat first declared the union of England and Russia to be an impossibility.\r\nWhen this union was actually established, no language was sufficiently\r\nstrong to express his mortification and his spite. At one moment he\r\ndeclared that Canning was a revolutionist who had entrapped the young and\r\ninexperienced Czar into an alliance with European radicalism; at another,\r\nthat England had made itself the cat's-paw of Russian ambition. Not till\r\nnow, he protested, could Europe understand what it had lost in Castlereagh.\r\nNor did Metternich confine himself to lamentations. While his\r\nrepresentatives at Paris and Berlin spared no effort to excite the\r\nsuspicion of those Courts against the Anglo-Russian project of\r\nintervention, the Austrian ambassador at London worked upon King George's\r\npersonal hostility to Canning, and conspired against the Minister with that\r\nimportant section of the English aristocracy which was still influenced by\r\nthe traditional regard for Austria. Berlin, however, was the only field\r\nwhere Metternich's diplomacy still held its own. King Frederick William had\r\nnot yet had time to acquire the habit of submission to the young Czar\r\nNicholas, and was therefore saved the pain of deciding which of two masters\r\nhe should obey. In spite of his own sympathy for the Greeks, he declined to\r\nconnect Prussia with the proposed joint-intervention, and remained passive,\r\njustifying this course by the absence of any material interests of Prussia\r\nin the East. Being neither a neighbour of the Ottoman Empire nor a maritime\r\nPower, Prussia had in fact no direct means of making its influence felt.\r\n\r\n[Treaty between England, Russia and France, July, 1827.]\r\n\r\nFrance, on whose action much more depended, was now governed wholly in the\r\ninterests of the Legitimist party. Louis XVIII. had died in 1824, and the\r\nCount of Artois had succeeded to the throne, under the title of Charles X.\r\nThe principles of the Legitimists would logically have made them defenders\r\nof the hereditary rights of the Sultan against his rebellious subjects; but\r\nthe Sultan, unlike Ferdinand of Spain, was not a Bourbon nor even a\r\nChristian; and in a case where the legitimate prince was an infidel and the\r\nrebels were Christians, the conscience of the most pious Legitimist might\r\nwell recoil from the perilous task of deciding between the divine rights of\r\nthe Crown and the divine rights of the Church, and choose, in so painful an\r\nemergency, the simpler course of gratifying the national love of action.\r\nThere existed, both among Liberals and among Ultramontanes, a real sympathy\r\nfor Greece, and this interest was almost the only one in which all French\r\npolitical sections felt that they had something in common. Liberals\r\nrejoiced in the prospect of making a new free State in Europe; Catholics,\r\nlike Charles X. himself, remembered Saint Louis and the Crusades;\r\ndiplomatists understood the extreme importance of the impending breach\r\nbetween Austria and Russia, and of the opportunity of allying France with\r\nthe latter Power. Thus the natural and disinterested impulse of the greater\r\npart of the public coincided exactly with the dictates of a far-seeing\r\npolicy; and the Government, in spite of its Legitimist principles and of\r\nsome assurances given to Metternich in person when he visited Paris in\r\n1825, determined to accept the policy of the Anglo-Russian intervention in\r\nthe East, and to participate in the active measures about to be taken by\r\nthe two Powers. The Protocol of St. Petersburg formed the basis of a\r\ndefinitive treaty which was signed at London in July, 1827. By this act\r\nEngland, Russia, and France undertook to put an end to the conflict in the\r\nEast, which, through the injury done to the commerce of all nations, had\r\nbecome a matter of European concern. The contending parties were to be\r\nsummoned to accept the mediation of the Powers and to consent to an\r\narmistice. Greece was to be made autonomous, under the paramount\r\nsovereignty of the Sultan; the Mohammedan population of the Greek provinces\r\nwas, as in the Protocol of St. Petersburg, to be entirely removed; and the\r\nGreeks were to enter upon possession of all Turkish property within their\r\nlimits, paying an indemnity to the former owners. Each of the three\r\ncontracting Governments pledged itself to seek no increase of territory in\r\nthe East, and no special commercial advantages. In the secret articles of\r\nthe treaty provisions were made for the case of the rejection by the Turks\r\nof the proposed offer of mediation. Should the armistice not be granted\r\nwithin one month, the Powers agreed that they would announce to each\r\nbelligerent their intention to prevent further encounters, and that they\r\nwould take the necessary steps for enforcing this declaration, without,\r\nhowever, taking part in hostilities themselves. Instructions in conformity\r\nwith the Treaty were to be sent to the Admirals commanding the\r\nMediterranean squadrons of the three Powers. [374]\r\n\r\n[Death of Canning, August, 1827.]\r\n\r\n[Policy of Canning.]\r\n\r\nScarcely was the Treaty of London signed when Canning died. He had\r\ndefinitely broken from the policy of his predecessors, that policy which,\r\nfor the sake of guarding against Russia's advance, had condemned the\r\nChristian races of the East to 1827. eternal subjection to the Turk, and\r\nbound up Great Britain with the Austrian system of resistance to the very\r\nprinciple and name of national independence. Canning was no blind friend to\r\nRussia. As keenly as any of his adversaries he appreciated the importance\r\nof England's interests in the East; of all English statesmen of that time\r\nhe would have been the last to submit to any diminution of England's just\r\ninfluence or power. But, unlike his predecessors, he saw that there were\r\ngreat forces at work which, whether with England's concurrence or in spite\r\nof it, would accomplish that revolution in the East for which the time was\r\nnow come; and he was statesman enough not to acquiesce in the belief that\r\nthe welfare of England was in permanent and necessary antagonism to the\r\nmoral interests of mankind and the better spirit of the age. Therefore,\r\ninstead of attempting to maintain the integrity of the Ottoman Empire, or\r\nholding aloof and resorting to threats and armaments while Russia\r\naccomplished the liberation of Greece by itself, he united with Russia in\r\nthis work, and relied on concerted action as the best preventive against\r\nthe undue extension of Russia's influence in the East. In committing\r\nEngland to armed intervention, Canning no doubt hoped that the settlement\r\nof the Greek question arranged by the Powers would be peacefully accepted\r\nby the Sultan, and that a separate war between Russia and the Porte, on\r\nthis or any other issue, would be averted. Neither of these hopes was\r\nrealised. The joint-intervention had to be enforced by arms, and no sooner\r\nhad the Allies struck their common blow than a war between Turkey and\r\nRussia followed. How far the course of events might have been modified had\r\nCanning's life not been cut short it is impossible to say; but whether his\r\nstatesmanship might or might not have averted war on the Danube, the\r\nbalance of results proved his policy to have been the right one. Greece was\r\nestablished as an independent State, to supply in the future a valuable\r\nelement of resistance to Slavic preponderance in the Levant; and the\r\nencounter between Russia and Turkey, so long dreaded, produced none of\r\nthose disastrous effects which had been anticipated from it. On the\r\nrelative value of Canning's statesmanship as compared with that of his\r\npredecessors, the mind of England and of Europe has long been made up. He\r\nstands among those who have given to this country its claim to the respect\r\nof mankind. His monument, as well as his justification, is the existence of\r\nnational freedom in the East; and when half a century later a British\r\nGovernment reverted to the principle of non-intervention, as it had been\r\nunderstood by Castlereagh, and declined to enter into any effective\r\nco-operation with Russia for the emancipation of Bulgaria, even then, when\r\nthe precedent of Canning's action in 1827 stood in direct and glaring\r\ncontradiction to the policy of the hour, no effective attempt was made by\r\nthe leaders of the party to which Canning had belonged to impugn his\r\nauthority, or to explain away his example. It might indeed be alleged that\r\nCanning had not explicitly resolved on the application of force; but those\r\nwho could maintain that Canning would, like Wellington, have used the\r\nlanguage of apology and regret when Turkish obstinacy had made it\r\nimpossible to effect the object of his intervention by any other means, had\r\nindeed read the history of Canning's career in vain. [375]\r\n\r\n[Intervention of the Admirals, Sept., 1827.]\r\n\r\nThe death of Canning, which brought his rival, the Duke of Wellington,\r\nafter a short interval to the head of affairs, caused at the moment no\r\navowed change in the execution of his plans. In accordance with the\r\nprovisions of the Treaty of London the mediation of the allied Powers was\r\nat once tendered to the belligerents, and an armistice demanded. The\r\narmistice was accepted by the Greeks; it was contemptuously refused by the\r\nTurks. In consequence of this refusal the state of war continued, as it\r\nwould have been absurd to ask the Greeks to sit still and be massacred\r\nbecause the enemy declined to lay down his arms. The Turk being the party\r\nresisting the mediation agreed upon, it became necessary to deprive him of\r\nthe power of continuing hostilities. Heavy reinforcements had just arrived\r\nfrom Egypt, and an expedition was on the point of sailing from Navarino,\r\nthe gathering place of Ibrahim's forces, against Hydra, the capture of\r\nwhich would have definitely made an end of the Greek insurrection. Admiral\r\nCodrington, the commander of the British fleet, and the French Admiral De\r\nRigny, were now off the coast of Greece. They addressed themselves to\r\nIbrahim, and required from him a promise that he would make no movement\r\nuntil further orders should arrive from Constantinople. Ibrahim made this\r\npromise verbally on the 25th of September. A few days later, however,\r\nIbrahim learnt that while he himself was compelled to be inactive, the\r\nGreeks, continuing hostilities as they were entitled to do, had won a\r\nbrilliant naval victory under Captain Hastings within the Gulf of Corinth.\r\nUnable to control his anger, he sailed out from the harbour of Navarino,\r\nand made for Patras. Codrington, who had stationed his fleet at Zante,\r\nheard of the movement, and at once threw himself across the track of the\r\nEgyptian, whom he compelled to turn back by an energetic threat to sink his\r\nfleet. Had the French and Russian contingents been at hand, Codrington\r\nwould have taken advantage of Ibrahim's sortie to cut him off from all\r\nGreek harbours, and to force him to return direct to Alexandria, thus\r\npeaceably accomplishing the object of the intervention. This, however, to\r\nthe misfortune of Ibrahim's seamen, the English admiral could not do alone.\r\nIbrahim re-entered Navarino, and there found the orders of the Sultan for\r\nwhich it had been agreed that he should wait. These orders were dictated by\r\ntrue Turkish infatuation. They bade Ibrahim continue the subjugation of the\r\nMorea with the utmost vigour, and promised him the assistance of Reschid\r\nPasha, his rival in the siege of Missolonghi. Ibrahim, perfectly reckless\r\nof the consequences, now sent out his devastating columns again. No life,\r\nand nothing that could support life, was spared. Not only were the crops\r\nravaged, but the fruit-trees, which are the permanent support of the\r\ncountry, were cut down at the roots. Clouds of fire and smoke from burning\r\nvillages showed the English officers who approached the coast in what\r\nspirit the Turk met their proposals for a pacification. \"It is supposed\r\nthat if Ibrahim remained in Greece,\" wrote Captain Hamilton, \"more than a\r\nthird of its inhabitants would die of absolute starvation.\"\r\n\r\n[Battle of Navarino, Oct. 20th, 1827.]\r\n\r\nIt became necessary to act quickly, the more so as the season was far\r\nadvanced, and a winter blockade of Ibrahim's fleet was impossible. A\r\nmessage was sent to the Egyptian head-quarters, requiring that hostilities\r\nshould cease, that the Morea should be evacuated, and the Turko-Egyptian\r\nfleet return to Constantinople and Alexandria. In answer to this message\r\nthere came back a statement that Ibrahim had left Navarino for the interior\r\nof the country, and that it was not known where to find him. Nothing now\r\nremained for the admirals but to make their presence felt. On the 18th of\r\nOctober it was resolved that the English, French, and Russian fleets, which\r\nwere now united, should enter the harbour of Navarino in battle order. The\r\nmovement was called a demonstration, and in so far as the admirals had not\r\nactually determined upon making an attack, it was not directly a hostile\r\nmeasure; but every gun was ready to open fire, and it was well understood\r\nthat any act of resistance on the part of the opposite fleet would result\r\nin hostilities. Codrington, as senior officer, took command of the allied\r\nsquadron, and the instructions which he gave to his colleagues for the\r\nevent of a general engagement concluded with Nelson's words, that no\r\ncaptain could do very wrong who placed his ship alongside that of an enemy.\r\n\r\nThus, ready to strike hard, the English admiral sailed into the harbour of\r\nNavarino at noon on October 20, followed by the French and the Russians.\r\nThe allied fleet advanced to within pistol-shot of the Ottoman ships and\r\nthere anchored. A little to the windward of the position assigned to the\r\nEnglish corvette _Dartmouth_ there lay a Turkish fire-ship. A request\r\nwas made that this dangerous vessel might be removed to a safer distance;\r\nit was refused, and a boat's crew was then sent to cut its cable. The boat\r\nwas received with musketry fire. This was answered by the _Dartmouth_\r\nand by a French ship, and the battle soon became general. Codrington, still\r\ndesirous to avoid bloodshed, sent his pilot to Moharem Bey, who commanded\r\nin Ibrahim's absence, proposing to withhold fire on both sides. Moharem\r\nreplied with cannon-shot, killing the pilot and striking Codrington's own\r\nvessel. This exhausted the patience of the English admiral, who forthwith\r\nmade his adversary a mere wreck. The entire fleets on both sides were now\r\nengaged. The Turks had a superiority of eight hundred guns, and fought with\r\ncourage. For four hours the battle raged at close quarters in the\r\nland-locked harbour, while twenty thousand of Ibrahim's soldiers watched\r\nfrom the surrounding hills the struggle in which they could take no part.\r\nBut the result of the combat was never for a moment doubtful. The confusion\r\nand bad discipline of the Turkish fleet made it an easy prey. Vessel after\r\nvessel was sunk or blown to pieces, and before evening fell the work of the\r\nallies was done. When Ibrahim returned from his journey on the following\r\nday he found the harbour of Navarino strewed with wrecks and dead bodies.\r\nFour thousand of his seamen had fallen; the fleet which was to have\r\naccomplished the reduction of Hydra was utterly ruined. [376]\r\n\r\n[Inaction of England after Navarino.]\r\n\r\nOver all Greece it was at once felt that the nation was saved. The\r\nintervention of the Powers had been sudden and decisive beyond the most\r\nsanguine hopes; and though this intervention might be intended to establish\r\nsomething less than the complete independence of Greece, the violence of\r\nthe first collision bade fair to carry the work far beyond the bounds\r\noriginally assigned to it. The attitude of the Porte after the news of the\r\nbattle of Navarino reached Constantinople was exactly that which its worst\r\nenemies might have desired. So far from abating anything in its resistance\r\nto the mediation of the three Powers, it declared the attack made upon its\r\nnavy to be a crime and an outrage, and claimed satisfaction for it from the\r\nambassadors of the Allied Powers. Arguments proved useless, and the united\r\ndemand for an armistice with the Greeks having been finally and\r\ncontemptuously refused, the ambassadors, in accordance with their\r\ninstructions, quitted the Turkish capital (Dec. 8). Had Canning been still\r\nliving, it is probable that the first blow of Navarino would have been\r\nimmediately followed by the measures necessary to make the Sultan submit to\r\nthe Treaty of London, and that the forces of Great Britain would have been\r\napplied with sufficient vigour to render any isolated action on the part of\r\nRussia both unnecessary and impossible. But at this critical moment a\r\nparalysis fell over the English Government. Canning's policy was so much\r\nhis own, he had dragged his colleagues so forcibly with him in spite of\r\nthemselves, that when his place was left empty no one had the courage\r\neither to fulfil or to reverse his intentions, and the men who succeeded\r\nhim acted as if they were trespassers in the fortress which Canning had\r\ntaken by storm. The very ground on which Wellington, no less than Canning,\r\nhad justified the agreement made with Russia in 1826 was the necessity of\r\npreventing Russia from acting alone; and when Russian and Turkish ships had\r\nactually fought at Navarino, and war was all but formally declared, it\r\nbecame more imperative than ever that Great Britain should keep the most\r\nvigorous hold upon its rival, and by steady, consistent pressure let it be\r\nknown to both Turks and Russians that the terms of the Treaty of London and\r\nno others must be enforced. To retire from action immediately after dealing\r\nthe Sultan one dire, irrevocable blow, without following up this stroke or\r\nattaining the end agreed upon--to leave Russia to take up the armed\r\ncompulsion where England had dropped it, and to win from its crippled\r\nadversary the gains of a private and isolated war--was surely the weakest\r\nof all possible policies that could have been adopted. Yet this was the\r\npolicy followed by English Ministers during that interval of transition and\r\nincoherence that passed between Canning's death and the introduction of the\r\nReform Bill.\r\n\r\n[War between Russia and Turkey, April, 1828.]\r\n\r\nBy the Russian Government nothing was more ardently desired than a contest\r\nwith Turkey, in which England and France, after they had destroyed the\r\nTurkish fleet, should be mere on-lookers, debarred by the folly of the\r\nPorte itself from prohibiting or controlling hostilities between it and its\r\nneighbour. There might indeed be some want of a pretext for war, since all\r\nthe points of contention between Russia and Turkey other than those\r\nrelating to Greece had been finally settled in Russia's favour by a Treaty\r\nsigned at Akerman in October, 1826. But the spirit of infatuation had\r\nseized the Sultan, or a secret hope that the Western Powers would in the\r\nlast resort throw over the Court of St. Petersburg led him to hurry on\r\nhostilities by a direct challenge to Russia. A proclamation which reads\r\nlike the work of some frantic dervish, though said to have been composed by\r\nMahmud himself, called the Mussulman world to arms. Russia was denounced as\r\nthe instigator of the Greek rebellion, and the arch-enemy of Islam. The\r\nTreaty of Akerman was declared to have been extorted by compulsion and to\r\nhave been signed only for the purpose of gaining time. \"Russia has imparted\r\nits own madness to the other Powers and persuaded them to make an alliance\r\nto free the Rayah from his Ottoman master. But the Turk does not count his\r\nenemies. The law forbids the people of Islam to permit any injury to be\r\ndone to their religion; and if all the unbelievers together unite against\r\nthem, they will enter on the war as a sacred duty, and trust in God for\r\nprotection.\" This proclamation was followed by a levy of troops and the\r\nexpulsion of most of the Christian residents in Constantinople. Russia\r\nneeded no other pretext. The fanatical outburst of the Sultan was treated\r\nby the Court of St. Petersburg as if it had been the deliberate expression\r\nof some civilised Power, and was answered on the 26th of April, 1828, by a\r\ndeclaration of war. In order to soften the effect of this step and to reap\r\nthe full benefit of its subsisting relations with France and England,\r\nRussia gave a provisional undertaking to confine its operations as a\r\nbelligerent to the mainland and the Black Sea, and within the Mediterranean\r\nto act still as one of the allied neutrals under the terms of the Treaty of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n[Military condition of Turkey.]\r\n\r\nThe moment seized by Russia for the declaration of war was one singularly\r\nfavourable to itself and unfortunate for its adversary. Not only had the\r\nTurkish fleet been destroyed by the neutrals, but the old Turkish force of\r\nthe Janissaries had been destroyed by its own master, and the new-modelled\r\nregiments which were to replace it had not yet been organised. The Sultan\r\nhad determined in 1826 to postpone his long-planned military reform no\r\nlonger, and to stake everything on one bold stroke against the Janissaries.\r\nTroops enough were brought up from the other side of the Bosphorus to make\r\nMahmud certain of victory. The Janissaries were summoned to contribute a\r\nproportion of their number to the regiments about to be formed on the\r\nEuropean pattern; and when they proudly refused to do so and raised the\r\nstandard of open rebellion they were cut to pieces and exterminated by\r\nMahmud's Anatolian soldiers in the midst of Constantinople. [377] The\r\nprincipal difficulty in the way of a reform of the Turkish army was thus\r\nremoved and the work of reorganisation was earnestly taken in hand; but\r\nbefore there was time to complete it the enemy entered the field. Mahmud\r\nhad to meet the attack of Russia with an army greatly diminished in number,\r\nand confused by the admixture of European and Turkish discipline. The\r\nresources of the empire were exhausted by the long struggle with Greece,\r\nand, above all, the destruction of the Janissaries had left behind it an\r\nexasperation which made the Sultan believe that rebellion might at any\r\nmoment break out in his own capital. Nevertheless, in spite of its inherent\r\nweakness and of all the disadvantages under which it entered into war,\r\nTurkey succeeded in prolonging its resistance through two campaigns, and\r\nmight, with better counsels, have tried the fortune of a third.\r\n\r\n[Military condition of Russia.]\r\n\r\nThe actual military resources of Russia were in 1828 much below what they\r\nwere believed to be by all Europe. The destruction of Napoleon's army in\r\n1812 and the subsequent exploits of Alexander in the campaigns which ended\r\nin the capture of Paris had left behind them an impression of Russian\r\nenergy and power which was far from corresponding with the reality, and\r\nwhich, though disturbed by the events of 1828, had by no means vanished at\r\nthe time of the Crimean War. The courage and patience of the Russian\r\nsoldier were certainly not over-rated; but the progress supposed to have\r\nbeen made in Russian military organisation since the campaign of 1799, when\r\nit was regarded in England and Austria as little above that of savages, was\r\nfor the most part imaginary. The proofs of a radically bad system--scanty\r\nnumbers, failing supplies, immense sickness--were never more conspicuous\r\nthan in 1828. Though Russia had been preparing for war for at least seven\r\nyears, scarcely seventy thousand soldiers could be collected on the Pruth.\r\nThe general was Wittgenstein, one of the heroes of 1812, but now a veteran\r\npast effective work. Nicholas came to the camp to make things worse by\r\nheadstrong interference. The best Russian officer, Paskiewitsch, was put in\r\ncommand of the forces about to operate in Asia Minor, and there, thrown on\r\nhis own resources and free to create a system of his own, he achieved\r\nresults in strong contrast to the failure of the Russian arms on the\r\nDanube.\r\n\r\n[Campaign of 1828.]\r\n\r\nIn entering on the campaign of 1828, it was necessary for the Czar to avoid\r\ngiving any unnecessary causes of anxiety to Austria, which had already made\r\nunsuccessful attempts to form a coalition against him. The line of\r\noperations was therefore removed as far as possible from the Austrian\r\nfrontier; and after the Roumanian principalities had been peacefully\r\noccupied, the Danube was crossed at a short distance above the point where\r\nits mouths divide (June 7). The Turks had no intention of meeting the enemy\r\nin a pitched battle; they confined themselves to the defence of fortresses,\r\nthe form of warfare to which, since the decline of the military art in\r\nTurkey, the patience and abstemiousness of the race best fit them. Ibraila\r\nand Silistria on the Danube, Varna and Shumla in the neighbourhood of the\r\nBalkans, were their principal strongholds; of these Ibraila was at once\r\nbesieged by a considerable force, while Silistria was watched by a weak\r\ncontingent, and the vanguard of the Russian army pushed on through the\r\nDobrudscha towards the Black Sea, where, with the capture of the minor\r\ncoast-towns, it expected to enter into communication with the fleet. The\r\nfirst few weeks of the campaign were marked by considerable successes.\r\nIbraila capitulated on the 18th of June, and the military posts in the\r\nDobrudscha fell one after another into the hands of the invaders, who met\r\nwith no effective resistance in this district. But their serious work was\r\nonly now beginning. The Russian army, in spite of its weakness, was divided\r\ninto three parts, occupied severally in front of Silistria, Shumla, and\r\nVarna. At Shumla the mass of the Turkish army, under Omer Brionis, was\r\nconcentrated. The force brought against it by the invader was inadequate to\r\nits task, and the attempts which were made to lure the Turkish army from\r\nits entrenched camp into the open field proved unsuccessful. The\r\ndifficulties of the siege proved so great that Wittgenstein after a while\r\nproposed to abandon offensive operations at this point, and to leave a mere\r\ncorps of observation before the enemy until Varna should have fallen. This,\r\nhowever, was forbidden by the Czar. As the Russians wasted away before\r\nShumla with sickness and fatigue, the Turks gained strength, and on the\r\n24th of September Omer broke out from his entrenchments and moved eastwards\r\nto the relief of Varna. Nicholas again over-ruled his generals, and ordered\r\nhis cousin, Prince Eugene of Würtemberg, to attack the advancing Ottomans\r\nwith the troops then actually at his disposal. Eugene did so, and suffered\r\na severe defeat. A vigorous movement of the Turks would probably have made\r\nan end of the campaign, but Omer held back at the critical moment, and on\r\nthe 10th of October Varna surrendered. This, however, was the only conquest\r\nmade by the Russians. The season was too far advanced for them either to\r\ncross the Balkans or to push forward operations against the uncaptured\r\nfortresses. Shumla and Silistria remained in the hands of their defenders,\r\nand the Russians, after suffering enormous losses in proportion to the\r\nsmallness of their numbers, withdrew to Varna and the Danube, to resume the\r\ncampaign in the spring of the following year. [378]\r\n\r\n[Campaign of 1829.]\r\n\r\nThe spirits of the Turks and of their European friends were raised by the\r\nunexpected failure of the Czar's arms. Metternich resumed his efforts to\r\nform a coalition, and tempted French Ministers with the prospect of\r\nrecovering the Rhenish provinces, but in vain. The Sultan began\r\nnegotiations, but broke them off when he found that the events of the\r\ncampaign had made no difference in the enemy's tone. The prestige of Russia\r\nwas in fact at stake, and Nicholas would probably have faced a war with\r\nAustria and Turkey combined rather than have made peace without restoring\r\nthe much-diminished reputation of his troops. The winter was therefore\r\nspent in bringing up distant reserves. Wittgenstein was removed from his\r\ncommand; the Czar withdrew from military operations in which he had done\r\nnothing but mischief; and Diebitsch, a Prussian by birth and training, was\r\nplaced at the head of the army, untrammelled by the sovereign presence or\r\ncounsels which had hampered his predecessor. The intention of the new\r\ncommander was to cross the Balkans as soon as Silistria should have fallen,\r\nwithout waiting for the capture of Shumla. In pursuance of this design the\r\nfleet was despatched early in the spring of 1829 to seize a port beyond the\r\nmountain-range. Diebitsch then placed a corps in front of Silistria, and\r\nmade his preparations for the southward march; but before any progress had\r\nbeen made in the siege the Turks themselves took the field. Reschid Pasha,\r\nnow Grand Vizier, moved eastwards from Shumla at the beginning of May\r\nagainst the weak Russian contingent that still lay in winter quarters\r\nbetween that place and Varna. The superiority of his force promised him\r\nan easy victory; but after winning some unimportant successes, and\r\nadvancing to a considerable distance from his stronghold, he allowed\r\nhimself to be held at bay until Diebitsch, with the army of the Danube,\r\nwas ready to fall upon his rear. The errors of the Turks had given to the\r\nRussian commander, who hastened across Bulgaria on hearing of his\r\ncolleague's peril, the choice of destroying their army, or of seizing\r\nShumla by a _coup-de-main_. Diebitsch determined upon attacking his\r\nenemy in the open field, and on the 10th of June Reschid's army, attempting\r\nto regain the roads to Shumla, was put to total rout at Kulewtscha. A\r\nfortnight later Silistria surrendered, and Diebitsch, reinforced by the\r\ntroops that had besieged that fortress, was now able to commence his\r\nmarch across the Balkans.\r\n\r\n[Crossing of the Balkans, July, 1829.]\r\n\r\nRumour magnified into hundreds of thousands the scanty columns which for\r\nthe first time carried the Russian flag over the Balkan range. Resistance\r\neverywhere collapsed. The mountains were crossed without difficulty, and on\r\nthe 19th of August the invaders appeared before Adrianople, which\r\nimmediately surrendered. Putting on the boldest countenance in order to\r\nconceal his real weakness, Diebitsch now struck out right and left, and\r\nsent detachments both to the Euxine and the Ægæan coast. The fleet\r\nco-operated with him, and the ports of the Black Sea, almost as far south\r\nas the Bosphorus, fell into the invaders' hands. The centre of the army\r\nbegan to march upon Constantinople. If the Sultan had known the real\r\nnumbers of the force which threatened his capital, a force not exceeding\r\ntwenty thousand men, he would probably have recognised that his assailant's\r\nposition was a more dangerous one than his own. Diebitsch had advanced into\r\nthe heart of the enemy's country with a mere handful of men. Sickness was\r\ndaily thinning his ranks; his troops were dispersed over a wide area from\r\nsea to sea; and the warlike tribes of Albania threatened to fall upon his\r\ncommunications from the west. For a moment the Sultan spoke of fighting\r\nupon the walls of Constantinople; but the fear of rebellion within his own\r\ncapital, the discovery of conspiracies, and the disasters sustained by his\r\narms in Asia, where Kars and Erzeroum had fallen into the enemy's hands,\r\nsoon led him to make overtures of peace and to accept the moderate terms\r\nwhich the Russian Government, aware of its own difficulties, was willing to\r\ngrant. It would have been folly for the Czar to stimulate the growing\r\nsuspicion of England and to court the attack of Austria by prolonging\r\nhostilities; and although King Charles X. and the French Cabinet, reverting\r\nto the ideas of Tilsit, proposed a partition of the Ottoman Empire, and a\r\ngeneral re-arrangement of the map of Europe which would have given Belgium\r\nand the Palatinate to France, the plan was originated too late to produce\r\nany effect. [379] Russia had everything to lose and nothing to gain by a\r\nEuropean war. It had reduced Turkey to submission, and might fairly hope to\r\nmaintain its ascendency at Constantinople during coming years without\r\nmaking any of those great territorial changes which would have given its\r\nrivals a pretext for intervening on the Sultan's behalf. Under the guise of\r\na generous forbearance the Czar extricated himself from a dangerous\r\nposition with credit and advantage. As much had been won as could be\r\nmaintained without hazard; and on the 14th of September peace was concluded\r\nin Adrianople.\r\n\r\n[Treaty of Adrianople, Sept. 14, 1829.]\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Adrianople gave Russia a slight increase of territory in\r\nAsia, incorporating with the Czar's dominions the ports of Anapa and Poti\r\non the eastern coast of the Black Sea; but its most important provisions\r\nwere those which confirmed and extended the Protectorate exercised by the\r\nCzar over the Danubian Principalities, and guaranteed the commercial rights\r\nof Russian subjects throughout the Ottoman Empire both by land and sea. In\r\norder more effectively to exclude the Sultan's influence from Wallachia and\r\nMoldavia, the office of Hospodar, hitherto tenable for seven years, was now\r\nmade an appointment for life, and the Sultan specifically engaged to permit\r\nno interference on the part of his neighbouring Pashas with the affairs of\r\nthese provinces. No fortified point was to be retained by the Turks on the\r\nleft bank of the Danube; no Mussulman was to be permitted to reside within\r\nthe Principalities; and those possessing landed estates there were to sell\r\nthem within eighteen months. The Porte pledged itself never again to detain\r\nRussian ships of commerce coming from the Black Sea, and acknowledged that\r\nsuch an act would amount to an infraction of treaties justifying Russia in\r\nhaving recourse to reprisals. The Straits of Constantinople and the\r\nDardanelles were declared free and open to the merchant ships of all Powers\r\nat peace with the Porte, upon the same conditions which were stipulated for\r\nvessels under the Russian flag. The same freedom of trade and navigation\r\nwas recognised within the Black Sea. All treaties and conventions hitherto\r\nconcluded between Turkey and Russia were recognised as in force, except in\r\nso far as modified by the present agreement. The Porte further gave its\r\nadhesion to the Treaty of London relating to Greece, and to an Act entered\r\ninto by the Allied Powers in March, 1829, for regulating the Greek\r\nfrontier. An indemnity in money was declared to be owing to Russia; and as\r\nthe amount of this remained to be fixed by mutual agreement, the means were\r\nstill left open to the Russian Government for exercising a gentle pressure\r\nat Constantinople, or for rewarding the compliance of the conquered. [380]\r\n\r\n[Capodistrias elected President of Greece, April, 1827.]\r\n\r\nThe war between Turkey and Russia, while it left the European frontier\r\nbetween the belligerents unchanged, exercised a two-fold influence upon the\r\nsettlement of Greece. On the one hand, by exciting the fears and suspicions\r\nof Great Britain, it caused the Government of our own country, under the\r\nDuke of Wellington, to insist on the limitation of the Greek State to the\r\nnarrowest possible area; [381] on the other hand, by reducing Turkey itself\r\nalmost to the condition of a Russian dependency, it led to the abandonment\r\nof the desire to maintain the Sultan's supremacy in any form over the\r\nemancipated provinces, and resulted in the establishment of an absolutely\r\nindependent Hellenic kingdom. An important change had taken place within\r\nGreece itself just at the time when the allied Powers determined upon\r\nintervention. The parts of the local leaders were played out, and in April,\r\n1827, Capodistrias, ex-Minister of Russia, was elected President for seven\r\nyears. Capodistrias accepted the call. He was then, as he had been\r\nthroughout the insurrection, at a distance from Greece; and before making\r\nhis way thither, he visited the principal Courts of Europe, with the view\r\nof ascertaining what moral or financial support he should be likely to\r\nreceive from them. His interview with the Czar Nicholas led to a clear\r\nstatement by that sovereign of the conditions which he expected\r\nCapodistrias, in return for Russia's continued friendship, to fulfil.\r\nGreece was to be rescued from revolution: in other words, personal was to\r\nbe substituted for popular government. The State was to remain tributary to\r\nthe Sultan: that is, in both Greece and Turkey the door was to be kept open\r\nfor Russia's interference. Whether Capodistrias had any intention of\r\nfulfilling the latter condition is doubtful. His love for Greece and his\r\nown personal ambition prevented his regard for Russia, strong though this\r\nmight be, from making him the mere instrument of the Court of St.\r\nPetersburg; and while outwardly acquiescing in the Czar's decision that\r\nGreece should remain a tributary State, he probably resolved from the first\r\nto aim at establishing its complete independence. With regard to the Czar's\r\ndemand that the system of local self-government should be superseded within\r\nGreece itself by one of autocratic rule, Capodistrias was in harmony with\r\nhis patron. He had been the Minister of a centralised despotism himself.\r\nHis experience was wholly that of the official of an absolute sovereign;\r\nand although Capodistrias had represented the more liberal tendencies of\r\nthe Russian Court when it was a question of arguing against Metternich\r\nabout the complete or the partial restoration of despotic rule in Italy, he\r\nhad no real acquaintance and no real sympathy with the action of free\r\ninstitutions, and moved in the same circle of ideas as the autocratic\r\nreformers of the eighteenth century, of whom Joseph II. was the type. [382]\r\n\r\n[The Protocols of Nov., 1828, and March, 1829.]\r\n\r\nThe Turks were still masters of the Morea when Capodistrias reached Greece.\r\nThe battle of Navarino had not caused Ibrahim to relax his hold upon the\r\nfortresses, and it was deemed necessary by the Allies to send a French\r\narmy-corps to dislodge him from his position. This expeditionary force,\r\nunder General Maison, landed in Greece in the summer of 1828, and Ibrahim,\r\nnot wishing to fight to the bitter end, contented himself with burning\r\nTripolitza to the ground and sowing it with salt, and then withdrew. The\r\nwar between Turkey and Russia had now begun. Capodistrias assisted the\r\nRussian fleet in blockading the Dardanelles, and thereby gained for himself\r\nthe marked ill-will of the British Government. At a conference held in\r\nLondon by the representatives of France, England, and Russia, in November,\r\n1828, it was resolved that the operations of the Allies should be limited\r\nto the Morea and the islands. Capodistrias, in consequence of this\r\ndecision, took the most vigorous measures for continuing the war against\r\nTurkey. What the allies refused to guarantee must be won by force of arms;\r\nand during the winter of 1829, while Russia pressed upon Turkey from the\r\nDanube, Capodistrias succeeded in reconquering Missolonghi and the whole\r\ntract of country immediately to the north of the Gulf of Corinth. The\r\nPorte, in prolonging its resistance after the November conference, played\r\nas usual into its enemy's hands. The negotiations at London were resumed in\r\na spirit somewhat more favourable to Greece, and a Protocol was signed on\r\nthe 22nd of March, 1829, extending the northern frontier of Greece up to a\r\nline drawn from the Gulf of Arta to the Gulf of Volo. Greece, according to\r\nthis Protocol, was still to remain under the Sultan's suzerainty: its ruler\r\nwas to be a hereditary prince belonging to one of the reigning European\r\nfamilies, but not to any of the three allied Courts. [383]\r\n\r\n[Leopold accepts the Greek Crown, Feb., 1830.]\r\n\r\nThe mediation of Great Britain was now offered to the Porte upon the terms\r\nthus laid down, and for the fourteenth time its mediation was rejected. But\r\nthe end was near at hand. Diebitsch crossed the Balkans, and it was in vain\r\nthat the Sultan then proposed the terms which he had scouted in November.\r\nThe Treaty of Adrianople enforced the decisions of the March Protocol.\r\nGreece escaped from a limitation of its frontier, which would have left\r\nboth Athens and Missolonghi Turkish territory. The principle of the\r\nadmission of the provinces north of the Gulf of Corinth within the Hellenic\r\nState was established, and nothing remained for the friends of the Porte\r\nbut to cut down to the narrowest possible area the district which had been\r\nloosely indicated in the London Protocol. While Russia, satisfied with its\r\nown successes against the Ottoman Empire and anxious to play the part of\r\npatron of the conquered, ceased to interest itself in Greece, the\r\nGovernment of Great Britain contested every inch of territory proposed to\r\nbe ceded to the new State, and finally induced the Powers to agree upon a\r\nboundary-line which did not even in letter fulfil the conditions of the\r\ntreaty. Northern Acarnania and part of Ætolia were severed from Greece,\r\nand the frontier was drawn from the mouth of the river Achelous to a spot\r\nnear Thermopylae. On the other hand, as Russian influence now appeared to\r\nbe firmly established and likely to remain paramount at Constantinople, the\r\nWestern Powers had no motive to maintain the Sultan's supremacy over\r\nGreece. This was accordingly by common consent abandoned; and the Hellenic\r\nKingdom, confined within miserably narrow limits on the mainland, and\r\nincluding neither Crete nor Samos among its islands, was ultimately offered\r\nin full sovereignty to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, the widower of\r\nCharlotte, daughter of George IV. After some negotiations, in which Leopold\r\nvainly asked for a better frontier, he accepted the Greek crown on the 11th\r\nof February, 1830.\r\n\r\n[Government of Capodistrias.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Capodistrias was struggling hard to govern and to organise\r\naccording to his own conceptions a land in which every element of anarchy,\r\nruin, and confusion appeared to be arrayed against the restoration of\r\ncivilised life. The country was devastated, depopulated, and in some places\r\nutterly barbarised. Out of a population of little more than a million, it\r\nwas reckoned that three hundred thousand had perished during the conflict\r\nwith the Turk. The whole fabric of political and social order had to be\r\nerected anew; and, difficult as this task would have been for the wisest\r\nruler, it was rendered much more difficult by the conflict between\r\nCapodistrias' own ideal and the character of the people among whom he had\r\nto work. Communal or local self-government lay at the very root of Greek\r\nnationality. In many different forms this intense provincialism had\r\nmaintained itself unimpaired up to the end of the war, in spite of national\r\nassemblies and national armaments. The Hydriote ship-owners, the Primates\r\nof the Morea, the guerilla leaders of the north, had each a type of life\r\nand a body of institutions as distinct as the dialects which they spoke or\r\nthe saints whom they cherished in their local sanctuaries. If antagonistic\r\nin some respects to national unity, this vigorous local life had\r\nnevertheless been a source of national energy while Greece had still its\r\nindependence to win; and now that national independence was won, it might\r\nwell have been made the basis of a popular and effective system of\r\nself-government. But to Capodistrias, as to greater men of that age, the\r\nunity of the State meant the uniformity of all its parts; and, shutting his\r\neyes to all the obstacles in his path, he set himself to create an\r\nadministrative system as rigorously centralised as that which France had\r\nreceived from Napoleon. Conscious of his own intellectual superiority over\r\nhis countrymen, conscious of his own integrity and of the sacrifice of all\r\nhis personal wealth in his country's service, he put no measure on his\r\nexpressions of scorn for the freebooters and peculators whom he believed to\r\nmake up the Greek official world, and he both acted and spoke as if, in the\r\nliteral sense of the words, all who ever came before him were thieves and\r\nrobbers. The peasants of the mainland, who had suffered scarcely less from\r\nKlephts and Primates than from Turks, welcomed Capodistrias' levelling\r\ndespotism, and to the end his name was popular among them; but among the\r\nclasses which had supplied the leaders in the long struggle for\r\nindependence, and especially among the ship-owners of the Archipelago, who\r\nfelt the contempt expressed by Capodistrias for their seven years' efforts\r\nto be grossly unjust, a spirit of opposition arose which soon made it\r\nevident that Capodistrias would need better instruments than those which he\r\nhad around him to carry out his task of remodelling Greece.\r\n\r\n[Leopold renounces the crown, May, 1830.]\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of this growing antagonism that the news reached\r\nCapodistrias that Leopold of Saxe-Coburg had been appointed King of Greece.\r\nThe resolution made by the Powers in March, 1829, that the sovereign of\r\nGreece should belong to some reigning house, had perhaps not wholly\r\ndestroyed the hopes of Capodistrias that he might become Prince or Hospodar\r\nof Greece himself. There were difficulties in the way of filling the\r\nthrone, and these difficulties, after the appointment of Leopold,\r\nCapodistrias certainly did not seek to lessen. His subtlety, his command of\r\nthe indirect methods of effecting a purpose, were so great and so habitual\r\nto him that there was little chance of his taking any overt step for\r\npreventing Leopold's accession to the crown; there appears, however, to be\r\nevidence that he repressed the indications of assent which the Greeks\r\nattempted to offer to Leopold; and a series of letters written by him to\r\nthat prince was probably intended, though in the most guarded language, to\r\ngive Leopold the impression that the task which awaited him was a hopeless\r\none. Leopold himself, at the very time when he accepted the crown, was\r\nwavering in his purpose. He saw with perfect clearness that the territory\r\ngranted to the Greek State was too small to secure either its peace or its\r\nindependence. The severance of Acarnania and Northern Ætolia meant the\r\nabandonment of the most energetic part of the Greek inland population, and\r\na probable state of incessant warfare upon the northern frontier; the\r\nrelinquishment of Crete meant that Greece, bankrupt as it was, must\r\nmaintain a navy to protect the south coast of the Morea from Turkish\r\nattack. These considerations had been urged upon the Powers by Leopold\r\nbefore he accepted the crown, and he had been induced for the moment to\r\nwithdraw them. But he had never fully acquiesced in the arrangements\r\nimposed upon him: he remained irresolute for some months; and at last,\r\nwhether led to this decision by the letters of Capodistrias or by some\r\nother influences, he declared the conditions under which he was called upon\r\nto rule Greece to be intolerable, and renounced the crown (May, 1830).\r\n[384]\r\n\r\n[Government and death of Capodistrias.]\r\n\r\nCapodistrias thus found himself delivered from his rival, and again face to\r\nface with the task to which duty or ambition called him. The candidature of\r\nLeopold had embittered the relations between Capodistrias and all who\r\nconfronted him in Greece, for it gave him the means of measuring their\r\nhostility to himself by the fervour of their addresses to this unknown\r\nforeigner. A dark shadow fell over his government. As difficulties\r\nthickened and resistance grew everywhere more determined, the President\r\nshowed himself harsher and less scrupulous in the choice of his means. The\r\nmen about him were untrustworthy; to crush them, he filled the offices of\r\ngovernment with relatives and creatures of his own who were at once\r\ntyrannous and incapable. Thwarted and checked, he met opposition by\r\nimprisonment and measures of violence, suspended the law-courts, and\r\nintroduced the espionage and the police-system of St. Petersburg. At length\r\narmed rebellion broke out, and while Miaoulis, the Hydriote admiral, blew\r\nup the best ships of the Greek navy to prevent them falling into the\r\nPresident's hands, the wild district of Maina, which had never admitted the\r\nTurkish tax-gatherer, refused to pay taxes to the Hellenic State. The\r\nrevolt was summarily quelled by Capodistrias, and several members of the\r\nfamily of Mauromichalis, including the chief Petrobei, formerly feudal\r\nruler of Maina, were arrested. Some personal insult, imaginary or real, was\r\nmoreover offered by Capodistrias to this fallen foe, after the aged mother\r\nof Petrobei, who had lost sixty-four kinsmen in the war against the Turks,\r\nhad begged for his release. The vendetta of the Maina was aroused. A son\r\nand a nephew of Petrobei laid wait for the President, and as he entered the\r\nChurch of St. Spiridion at Nauplia on the 9th of October, 1831, a\r\npistol-shot and a blow from a yataghan laid him dead on the ground. He had\r\nbeen warned that his life was sought, but had refused to make any change in\r\nhis habits, or to allow himself to be attended by a guard.\r\n\r\n[Otho King of Greece, Feb. 1, 1833.]\r\n\r\nThe death of Capodistrias excited sympathies and regrets which to a great\r\nextent silenced criticism upon his government, and which have made his name\r\none of those most honoured by the Greek nation. His fall threw the country\r\ninto anarchy. An attempt was made by his brother Augustine to retain\r\nautocratic power, but the result was universal dissension and the\r\ninterference of the foreigner. At length the Powers united in finding a\r\nsecond sovereign for Greece, and brought the weary scene of disorder to a\r\nclose. Prince Otho of Bavaria was sent to reign at Athens, and with him\r\nthere came a group of Bavarian officials to whom the Courts of Europe\r\npersuaded themselves that the future of Greece might be safely entrusted. A\r\nfrontier somewhat better than that which had been offered to Leopold was\r\ngranted to the new sovereign, but neither Crete, Thessaly, nor Epirus was\r\nincluded within his kingdom. Thus hemmed in within intolerably narrow\r\nlimits, while burdened with the expenses of an independent state, alike\r\nunable to meet the calls upon its national exchequer and to exclude the\r\nintrigues of foreign Courts, Greece offered during the next generation\r\nlittle that justified the hopes that had been raised as to its future. But\r\nthe belief of mankind in the invigorating power of national independence is\r\nnot wholly vain, nor, even under the most hostile conditions, will the\r\nefforts of a liberated people fail to attract the hope and the envy of\r\nthose branches of its race which still remain in subjection. Poor and\r\ninglorious as the Greek kingdom was, it excited the restless longings not\r\nonly of Greeks under Turkish bondage, but of the prosperous Ionian Islands\r\nunder English rule; and in 1864 the first step in the expansion of the\r\nHellenic kingdom was accomplished by the transfer of these islands from\r\nGreat Britain to Greece. Our own day has seen Greece further strengthened\r\nand enriched by the annexation of Thessaly. The commercial and educational\r\ndevelopment of the kingdom is now as vigorous as that of any State in\r\nEurope: in agriculture and in manufacturing industry it still lingers far\r\nbehind. Following the example of Cavour and the Sardinian statesmen who\r\njudged no cost too great in preparing for Italian union, the rulers of\r\nGreece burden the national finances with the support of an army and navy\r\nexcessive in comparison both with the resources and with the present\r\nrequirements of the State. To the ideal of a great political future the\r\nmaterial progress of the land has been largely sacrificed. Whether, in the\r\nre-adjustment of frontiers which must follow upon the gradual extrusion of\r\nthe Turk from Eastern Europe, Greece will gain from its expenditure\r\nadvantages proportionate to the undoubted evils which it has involved, the\r\nfuture alone can decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrance before 1830--Reign of Charles X.--Ministry of Martignac--Ministry of\r\nPolignac--The Duke of Orleans--War in Algiers--The July Ordinances--\r\nRevolution of July--Louis Philippe King--Nature and Effects of the July\r\nRevolution--Affairs in Belgium--The Belgian Revolution--The Great\r\nPowers--Intervention, and Establishment of the Kingdom of Belgium--Affairs\r\nof Poland--Insurrection at Warsaw--War between Russia and Poland--Overthrow\r\nof the Poles: End of the Polish Constitution--Affairs of Italy--\r\nInsurrection in the Papal States--France and Austria--Austrian\r\nIntervention--Ancona occupied by the French--Affairs of Germany--Prussia;\r\nthe Zollverein--Brunswick, Hanover, Saxony--The Palatinate--Reaction in\r\nGermany--Exiles in Switzerland; Incursion into Savoy--Dispersion of the\r\nExiles--France under Louis Philippe: Successive Risings--Period of\r\nParliamentary Activity--England after 1830: The Reform Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Congress of Vienna re-arranged the map of Europe after Napoleon's\r\nfall, Lord Castlereagh expressed the opinion that no prudent statesman\r\nwould forecast a duration of more than seven years for any settlement that\r\nmight then be made. At the end of a period twice as long the Treaties of\r\n1815 were still the public law of Europe. The grave had peacefully closed\r\nover Napoleon; the revolutionary forces of France had given no sign of\r\nreturning life. As the Bourbon monarchy struck root, and the elements of\r\nopposition grew daily weaker in France, the perils that lately filled all\r\nminds appeared to grow obsolete, and the very Power against which the\r\nanti-revolutionary treaties of 1815 had been directed took its place, as of\r\nnatural right, by the side of Austria and Russia in the struggle against\r\nrevolution. The attack of Louis XVIII. upon the Spanish Constitutionalists\r\nmarked the complete reconciliation of France with the Continental dynasties\r\nwhich had combined against it in 1815; and from this time the Treaties of\r\nChaumont and Aix-la-Chapelle, though their provisions might be still\r\nunchallenged, ceased to represent the actual relations existing between the\r\nPowers. There was no longer a moral union of the Courts against a supposed\r\nFrench revolutionary State; on the contrary, when Eastern affairs reached\r\ntheir crisis, Russia detached itself from its Hapsburg ally, and definitely\r\nallied itself with France. If after the Peace of Adrianople any one Power\r\nstood isolated, it was Austria; and if Europe was threatened by renewed\r\naggression, it was not under revolutionary leaders or with revolutionary\r\nwatchwords, but as the result of an alliance between Charles X. and the\r\nCzar of Russia. After the Bourbon Cabinet had resolved to seek an extension\r\nof French territory at whatever sacrifice of the balance of power in the\r\nEast, Europe could hardly expect that the Court of St. Petersburg would\r\nlong reject the advantages offered to it. The frontiers of 1815 seemed\r\nlikely to be obliterated by an enterprise which would bring Russia to the\r\nDanube and France to the Rhine. From this danger the settlement of 1815 was\r\nsaved by the course of events that took place within France itself. The\r\nRevolution of 1830, insignificant in its immediate effects upon the French\r\npeople, largely influenced the governments and the nations of Europe; and\r\nwhile within certain narrow limits it gave a stimulus to constitutional\r\nliberty, its more general result was to revive the union of the three\r\nEastern Courts which had broken down in 1826, and to reunite the principal\r\nmembers of the Holy Alliance by the sense of a common interest against the\r\nLiberalism of the West.\r\n\r\n[Government of Charles X., 1824-1827.]\r\n\r\nIn the person of Charles X. reaction and clericalism had ascended the\r\nFrench throne. The minister, Villèle, who had won power in 1820 as the\r\nrepresentative of the Ultra-Royalists, had indeed learnt wisdom while in\r\noffice, and down to the death of Louis XVIII. in 1824 he had kept in check\r\nthe more violent section of his party. But he now retained his post only at\r\nthe price of compliance with the Court, and gave the authority of his name\r\nto measures which his own judgment condemned. It was characteristic of\r\nCharles X. and of the reactionaries around him that out of trifling matters\r\nthey provoked more exasperation than a prudent Government would have\r\naroused by changes of infinitely greater importance. Thus in a\r\nsacrilege-law which was introduced in 1825 they disgusted all reasonable\r\nmen by attempting to revive the barbarous mediæval punishment of amputation\r\nof the hand; and in a measure conferring some fractional rights upon the\r\neldest son in cases of intestacy they alarmed the whole nation by a\r\npreamble declaring the French principle of the equal division of\r\ninheritances to be incompatible with monarchy. Coming from a Government\r\nwhich had thus already forfeited public confidence, a law granting the\r\nemigrants a compensation of £40,000,000 for their estates which had been\r\nconfiscated during the Revolution excited the strongest opposition,\r\nalthough, apart from questions of equity, it benefited the nation by for\r\never setting at rest all doubt as to the title of the purchasers of the\r\nconfiscated lands. The financial operations by which, in order to provide\r\nthe vast sum allotted to the emigrants, the national debt was converted\r\nfrom a five per cent, to a three per cent, stock, alienated all\r\nstockholders and especially the powerful bankers of Paris. But more than\r\nany single legislative act, the alliance of the Government with the\r\npriestly order, and the encouragement given by it to monastic corporations,\r\nwhose existence in France was contrary to law, offended the nation. The\r\nJesuits were indicted before the law-courts by Montlosier, himself a\r\nRoyalist and a member of the old noblesse. A vehement controversy sprang up\r\nbetween the ecclesiastics and their opponents, in which the Court was not\r\nspared. The Government, which had lately repealed the law of censorship,\r\nnow restored it by edict. The climax of its unpopularity was reached; its\r\nhold upon the Chamber was gone, and the very measure by which Villèle, when\r\nat the height of his power, had endeavoured to give permanence to his\r\nadministration, proved its ruin. He had abolished the system of partial\r\nrenovation, by which one-fifth of the Chamber of Deputies was annually\r\nreturned, and substituted for it the English system of septennial\r\nParliaments with general elections. In 1827 King Charles, believing his\r\nMinisters to be stronger in the country than in the Chamber, exercised his\r\nprerogative of dissolution. The result was the total defeat of the\r\nGovernment, and the return of an assembly in which the Liberal opposition\r\noutnumbered the partisans of the Court by three to one. Villèle's Ministry\r\nnow resigned. King Charles, unwilling to choose his successor from the\r\nParliamentary majority, thought for a moment of violent resistance, but\r\nsubsequently adopted other counsels, and, without sincerely intending to\r\nbow to the national will, called to office the Vicomte de Martignac, a\r\nmember of the right centre, and the representative of a policy of\r\nconciliation and moderate reform (January 2, 1828).\r\n\r\n[Ministry of Martignac, 1828-29.]\r\n\r\n[Polignac Minister, Aug. 9, 1829.]\r\n\r\nIt was not the fault of this Minister that the last chance of union between\r\nthe French nation and the elder Bourbon line was thrown away. Martignac\r\nbrought forward a measure of decentralisation conferring upon the local\r\nauthorities powers which, though limited, were larger than they had\r\npossessed at any time since the foundation of the Consulate; and he\r\nappealed to the Liberal sections of the Chamber to assist him in winning an\r\ninstalment of self-government which France might well have accepted with\r\nsatisfaction. But the spirit of opposition within the Assembly was too\r\nstrong for a coalition of moderate men, and the Liberals made the success\r\nof Martignac's plan impossible by insisting on concessions which the\r\nMinister was unable to grant. The reactionists were ready to combine with\r\ntheir opponents. King Charles himself was in secret antagonism to his\r\nMinister, and watched with malicious joy his failure to control the\r\nmajority in the Chamber. Instead of throwing all his influence on to the\r\nside of Martignac, and rallying all doubtful forces by the pronounced\r\nsupport of the Crown, he welcomed Martignac's defeat as a proof of the\r\nuselessness of all concessions, and dismissed the Minister from office,\r\ndeclaring that the course of events had fulfilled his own belief in the\r\nimpossibility of governing in accord with a Parliament. The names of the\r\nMinisters who were now called to power excited anxiety and alarm not only\r\nin France but throughout the political circles of Europe. They were the\r\nnames of men known as the most violent and embittered partisans of\r\nreaction; men whose presence in the councils of the King could mean nothing\r\nbut a direct attack upon the existing Parliamentary system of France. At\r\nthe head was Jules Polignac, then French ambassador at London, a man\r\nhalf-crazed with religious delusions, who had suffered a long imprisonment\r\nfor his share in Cadoudal's attempt to kill Napoleon, and on his return to\r\nFrance in 1814 had refused to swear to the Charta because it granted\r\nreligious freedom to non-Catholics. Among the subordinate members of the\r\nMinistry were General Bourmont, who had deserted to the English at\r\nWaterloo, and La Bourdonnaye, the champion of the reactionary Terrorists in\r\n1816. [385]\r\n\r\n[Prospects in 1830. The Orleanists.]\r\n\r\nThe Ministry having been appointed immediately after the close of the\r\nsession of 1829, an interval of several months passed before they were\r\nbrought face to face with the Chambers. During this interval the prospect\r\nof a conflict with the Crown became familiar to the public mind, though no\r\ngeneral impression existed that an actual change of dynasty was close at\r\nhand. The Bonapartists were without a leader, Napoleon's son, their natural\r\nhead, being in the power of the Austrian Court; the Republicans were\r\nneither numerous nor well organised, and the fatal memories of 1793 still\r\nweighed upon the nation; the great body of those who contemplated\r\nresistance to King Charles X. looked only to a Parliamentary struggle, or,\r\nin the last resort, to the refusal of payment of taxes in case of a breach\r\nof the Constitution. There was, however, a small and dexterous group of\r\npoliticians which, at a distance from all the old parties, schemed for the\r\ndethronement of the reigning branch of the House of Bourbon, and for the\r\nelevation of Louis Philippe, Duke of Orleans, to the throne. The chief of\r\nthis intrigue was Talleyrand. Slighted and thwarted by the Court, the old\r\ndiplomatist watched for the signs of a falling Government, and when the\r\nfamiliar omens met his view he turned to the quarter from which its\r\nsuccessor was most likely to arise. Louis Philippe stood high in credit\r\nwith all circles of Parliamentary Liberals. His history had been a strange\r\nand eventful one. He was the son of that Orleans who, after calling himself\r\nÉgalité, and voting for the death of his cousin, Louis XVI., had himself\r\nperished during the Reign of Terror. Young Louis Philippe had been a member\r\nof the Jacobin Club, and had fought for the Republic at Jemappes. Then,\r\nexiled and reduced to penury, he had earned his bread by teaching\r\nmathematics in Switzerland, and had been a wanderer in the new as well as\r\nin the old world. After awhile his fortunes brightened. A marriage with the\r\ndaughter of Ferdinand of Sicily restored him to those relations with the\r\nreigning houses of Europe which had been forfeited by his father, and\r\ninspired him with the hope of gaining a crown. During Napoleon's invasion\r\nof Spain he had caballed with politicians in that country who were inclined\r\nto accept a substitute for their absent sovereign; at another time he had\r\nentertained hopes of being made king of the Ionian Islands. After the peace\r\nof Paris, when the allied sovereigns and their ministers visited England,\r\nLouis Philippe was sent over by his father-in-law to intrigue among them\r\nagainst Murat, and in pursuance of this object he made himself acquainted\r\nnot only with every foreign statesman then in London but with every leading\r\nEnglish politician. He afterwards settled in France, and was reinstated in\r\nthe vast possessions of the House of Orleans, which, though confiscated,\r\nhad not for the most part been sold during the Revolution. His position at\r\nParis under Louis XVIII. and Charles X. was a peculiar one. Without taking\r\nany direct part in politics or entering into any avowed opposition to the\r\nCourt, he made his home, the Palais Royale, a gathering-place for all that\r\nwas most distinguished in the new political and literary society of the\r\ncapital; and while the Tuileries affected the pomp and the ceremoniousness\r\nof the old regime, the Duke of Orleans moved with the familiarity of a\r\ncitizen among citizens. He was a clever, ready, sensible man, equal, as it\r\nseemed, to any practical task likely to come in his way, but in reality\r\nvoid of any deep insight, of any far-reaching aspiration, of any profound\r\nconviction. His affectation of a straightforward middle-class geniality\r\ncovered a decided tendency towards intrigue and a strong love of personal\r\npower. Later events indeed gave rise to the belief that, while professing\r\nthe utmost loyalty to Charles X., Louis Philippe had been scheming to oust\r\nhim from his throne; but the evidence really points the other way, and\r\nindicates that, whatever secret hopes may have suggested themselves to the\r\nDuke, his strongest sentiment during the Revolution of 1830 was the fear of\r\nbeing driven into exile himself, and of losing his possessions. He was not\r\nindeed of a chivalrous nature; but when the Crown came in his way, he was\r\nguilty of no worse offence than some shabby evasions of promises.\r\n\r\n[Meeting and Prorogation of the Chambers, March, 1830.]\r\n\r\nEarly in March, 1830, the French Chambers assembled after their recess. The\r\nspeech of King Charles at the opening of the session was resolute and even\r\nthreatening. It was answered by an address from the Lower House, requesting\r\nhim to dismiss his Ministers. The deputation which presented this address\r\nwas received by the King in a style that left no doubt as to his\r\nintentions, and on the following day the Chambers were prorogued for six\r\nmonths. It was known that they would not be permitted to meet again, and\r\npreparations for a renewed general election were at once made with the\r\nutmost vigour by both parties throughout France. The Court unsparingly\r\napplied all the means of pressure familiar to French governments; it\r\nmoreover expected to influence public opinion by some striking success in\r\narms or in diplomacy abroad. The negotiations with Russia for the\r\nacquisition of Belgium were still before the Cabinet, and a quarrel with\r\nthe Dey of Algiers gave Polignac the opportunity of beginning a war of\r\nconquest in Africa. General Bourmont left the War Office, to wipe out the\r\ninfamy still attaching to his name by a campaign against the Arabs; and the\r\nGovernment trusted that, even in the event of defeat at the elections, the\r\nnation at large would at the most critical moment be rallied to its side by\r\nan announcement of the capture of Algiers.\r\n\r\n[Polignac's project.]\r\n\r\nWhile the dissolution of Parliament was impending, Polignac laid before the\r\nKing a memorial expressing his own views on the courses open to Government\r\nin case of the elections proving adverse. The Charta contained a clause\r\nwhich, in loose and ill-chosen language, declared it to be the function of\r\nthe King \"to make the regulations and ordinances necessary for the\r\nexecution of the laws and for the security of the State.\" These words,\r\nwhich no doubt referred to the exercise of the King's normal and\r\nconstitutional powers, were interpreted by Polignac as authorising the King\r\nto suspend the Constitution itself, if the Representative Assembly should\r\nbe at variance with the King's Ministers. Polignac in fact entertained the\r\nsame view of the relation between executive and deliberative bodies as\r\nthose Jacobin directors who made the _coup-d'état_ of Fructidor, 1797;\r\nand the measures which he ultimately adopted were, though in a softened\r\nform, those adopted by Barras and Laréveillère after the Royalist elections\r\nin the sixth year of the Republic. To suspend the Constitution was not, he\r\nsuggested, to violate the Charta, for the Charta empowered the sovereign to\r\nissue the ordinances necessary for the security of the State; and who but\r\nthe sovereign and his advisers could be the judges of this necessity? This\r\nwas simple enough; there was nevertheless among Polignac's colleagues some\r\ndoubt both as to the wisdom and as to the legality of his plans. King\r\nCharles who, with all his bigotry, was anxious not to violate the letter of\r\nthe Charta, brooded long over the clause which defined the sovereign's\r\npowers. At length he persuaded himself that his Minister's interpretation\r\nwas the correct one, accepted the resignation of the dissentients within\r\nthe Cabinet, and gave his sanction to the course which Polignac\r\nrecommended. [386]\r\n\r\n[Elections of 1830.]\r\n\r\nThe result of the general election, which took place in June, surpassed all\r\nthe hopes of the Opposition and all the fears of the Court. The entire body\r\nof Deputies which had voted the obnoxious address to the Crown in March was\r\nreturned, and the partisans of Government lost in addition fifty seats. The\r\nCabinet, which had not up to this time resolved upon the details of its\r\naction, now deliberated upon several projects submitted to it, and, after\r\nrejecting all plans that might have led to a compromise, determined to\r\ndeclare the elections null and void, to silence the press, and to supersede\r\nthe existing electoral system by one that should secure the mastery of the\r\nGovernment both at the polling-booths and in the Chamber itself. All this\r\nwas to be done by Royal Edict, and before the meeting of the new\r\nParliament. The date fixed for the opening of the Chambers had been placed\r\nas late as possible in order to give time to General Bourmont to win the\r\nvictory in Africa from which the Court expected to reap so rich a harvest\r\nof prestige. On the 9th of July news arrived that Algiers had fallen. The\r\nannouncement, which was everywhere made with the utmost pomp, fell flat on\r\nthe country. The conflict between the Court and the nation absorbed all\r\nminds, and the rapturous congratulations of Bishops and Prefects scarcely\r\nmisled even the blind _côterie_ of the Tuileries. Public opinion was\r\nno doubt with the Opposition; King Charles, however, had no belief that the\r\npopulace of Paris, which alone was to be dreaded as a fighting body, would\r\ntake up arms on behalf of the middle-class voters and journalists against\r\nwhom his Ordinances were to be directed. The populace neither read nor\r\nvoted: why should it concern itself with constitutional law? Or why, in a\r\nmatter that related only to the King and the Bourgeoisie, should it not\r\ntake part with the King against this new and bastard aristocracy which\r\nlived on others' labour? Politicians who could not fight were troublesome\r\nonly when they were permitted to speak and to write. There was force enough\r\nat the King's command to close the gates of the Chamber of Deputies, and to\r\nbreak up the printing-presses of the journals; and if King Louis XVI. had\r\nat last fallen by the hands of men of violence, it was only because he had\r\nmade concessions at first to orators and politicians. Therefore, without\r\ndreaming that an armed struggle would be the immediate result of their\r\naction, King Charles and Polignac determined to prevent the meeting of the\r\nChamber, and to publish, a week before the date fixed for its opening, the\r\nEdicts which were to silence the brawl of faction and to vindicate\r\nmonarchical government in France.\r\n\r\n[The Ordinances, July 26, 1830.]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the 26th of July, a series of Ordinances appeared in the\r\n_Moniteur_, signed by the King and counter-signed by the Ministers.\r\nThe first Ordinance forbade the publication of any journal without royal\r\npermission; the second dissolved the Chamber of Deputies; the third raised\r\nthe property-qualification of voters, established a system of\r\ndouble-election, altered the duration of Parliaments, and re-enacted the\r\nobsolete clause of the Charta confining the initiative in all legislation\r\nto the Government. Other Ordinances convoked a Chamber to be elected under\r\nthe new rules, and called to the Council of State a number of the most\r\nnotorious Ultra-Royalists and fanatics in France. Taken together, the\r\nOrdinances left scarcely anything standing of the Constitutional and\r\nParliamentary system of the day. The blow fell first on the press, and the\r\nfirst step in resistance was taken by the journalists of Paris, who, under\r\nthe leadership of the young Thiers, editor of the _National_,\r\npublished a protest declaring that they would treat the Ordinances as\r\nillegal, and calling upon the Chambers and nation to join in this\r\nresistance. For a while the journalists seemed likely to stand alone. Paris\r\nat large remained quiet, and a body of the recently elected Deputies, to\r\nwhom the journalists appealed as representatives of the nation, proved\r\nthemselves incapable of any action or decision whatsoever. It was not from\r\nthese timid politicians, but from a body of obscure Republicans, that the\r\nimpulse proceeded which overthrew the Bourbon throne. Unrepresented in\r\nParliament and unrepresented in the press, there were a few active men who\r\nhad handed down the traditions of 1792, and who, in sympathy with the\r\nCarbonari and other conspirators abroad, had during recent years founded\r\nsecret societies in Paris, and enlisted in the Republican cause a certain\r\nnumber of workmen, of students, and of youths of the middle classes. While\r\nthe journalists discussed legal means of resistance, and the Deputies\r\nawaited events, the Republican leaders met and determined upon armed\r\nrevolt. They were assisted, probably without direct concert, by the\r\nprinting firms and other employers of labour, who, in view of the general\r\nsuspension of the newspapers, closed their establishments on the morning of\r\nJuly 27, and turned their workmen into the streets.\r\n\r\n[July 27.]\r\n\r\n[July 28.]\r\n\r\nThus on the day after the appearance of the Edicts the aspect of Paris\r\nchanged. Crowds gathered, and revolutionary cries were raised. Marmont, who\r\nwas suddenly ordered to take command of the troops, placed them around the\r\nTuileries, and captured two barricades which were erected in the\r\nneighbourhood; but the populace was not yet armed, and no serious conflict\r\ntook place. In the evening Lafayette reached Paris, and the revolution had\r\nnow a real, though not an avowed, leader. A body of his adherents met\r\nduring the night at the office of the _National_, and, in spite of\r\nThiers' resistance, decided upon a general insurrection. Thiers himself,\r\nwho desired nothing but a legal and Parliamentary attack upon Charles X.,\r\nquitted Paris to await events. The men who had out-voted him placed\r\nthemselves in communication with all the district committees of Paris, and\r\nbegan the actual work of revolt by distributing arms. On the morning of\r\nWednesday, July 28th, the first armed bands attacked and captured the\r\narsenals and several private depôts of weapons and ammunition. Barricades\r\nwere erected everywhere. The insurgents swelled from hundreds to thousands,\r\nand, converging on the old rallying-point of the Commune of Paris, they\r\nseized the Hôtel de Ville, and hoisted the tricolor flag on its roof.\r\nMarmont wrote to the King, declaring the position to be most serious, and\r\nadvising concession; he then put his troops in motion, and succeeded, after\r\na severe conflict, in capturing several points of vantage, and in expelling\r\nthe rebels from the Hôtel de Ville.\r\n\r\n[July 29.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Deputies, who were assembled at the house of one of\r\ntheir number in pursuance of an agreement made on the previous day, gained\r\nsufficient courage to adopt a protest declaring that in spite of the\r\nOrdinances they were still the legal representatives of the nation. They\r\nmoreover sent a deputation to Marmont, begging him to put a stop to the\r\nfighting, and offering their assistance in restoring order if the King\r\nwould withdraw his Edicts. Marmont replied that he could do nothing without\r\nthe King's command, but he despatched a second letter to St. Cloud, urging\r\ncompliance. The only answer which he received was a command to concentrate\r\nhis troops and to act in masses. The result of this was that the positions\r\nwhich had been won by hard fighting were abandoned before evening, and that\r\nthe troops, famished and exhausted, were marched back through the streets\r\nof Paris to the Tuileries. On the march some fraternised with the people,\r\nothers were surrounded and disarmed. All eastern Paris now fell into the\r\nhands of the insurgents; the middle-class, as in 1789 and 1792, remained\r\ninactive, and allowed the contest to be decided by the populace and the\r\nsoldiery. Messages from the capital constantly reached St. Cloud, but the\r\nKing so little understood his danger and so confidently reckoned on the\r\nvictory of the troops in the Tuileries that he played whist as usual during\r\nthe evening; and when the Duc de Mortemart, French Ambassador at St.\r\nPetersburg, arrived at nightfall, and pressed for an audience, the King\r\nrefused to receive him until the next morning. When morning came, the march\r\nof the insurgents against the Tuileries began. Position after position fell\r\ninto their hands. The regiments stationed in the Place Vendôme abandoned\r\ntheir commander, and marched off to place themselves at the disposal of the\r\nDeputies. Marmont ordered the Swiss Guard, which had hitherto defended the\r\nLouvre, to replace them; and in doing so he left the Louvre for a moment\r\nwithout any garrison. The insurgents saw the building empty, and rushed\r\ninto it. From the windows they commanded the Court of the Tuileries, where\r\nthe troops in reserve were posted; and soon after mid-day all was over. A\r\nfew isolated battalions fought and perished, but the mass of the soldiery\r\nwith their commander fell back upon the Place de la Concorde, and then\r\nevacuated Paris. [387]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Orleans was all this time in hiding. He had been warned that\r\nthe Court intended to arrest him, and, whether from fear of the Court or of\r\nthe populace, he had secreted himself at a hunting-lodge in his woods,\r\nallowing none but his wife and his sister to know where he was concealed.\r\nHis partisans, of whom the rich and popular banker, Laffitte, was the most\r\ninfluential among the Deputies, were watching for an opportunity to bring\r\nforward his name; but their chances of success seemed slight. The Deputies\r\nat large wished only for the withdrawal of the Ordinances, and were wholly\r\naverse from a change of dynasty. It was only through the obstinacy of King\r\nCharles himself, and as the result of a series of accidents, that the Crown\r\npassed from the elder Bourbon line. King Charles would not hear of\r\nwithdrawing the Ordinances until the Tuileries had actually fallen; he then\r\ngave way and charged the Duc de Mortemart to form a new Ministry, drawn\r\nfrom the ranks of the Opposition. But instead of formally repealing the\r\nEdicts by a public Decree, he sent two messengers to Paris to communicate\r\nhis change of purpose to the Deputies by word of mouth. The messengers\r\nbetook themselves to the Hôtel de Ville, where a municipal committee under\r\nLafayette had been installed; and, when they could produce no written\r\nauthority for their statements, they were referred by this committee to the\r\ngeneral body of Deputies, which was now sitting at Laffitte's house. The\r\nDeputies also demanded a written guarantee. Laffitte and Thiers spoke in\r\nfavour of the Duke of Orleans, but the Assembly at large was still willing\r\nto negotiate with Charles X., and only required the presence of the Duc de\r\nMortemart himself, and a copy of the Decree repealing the Ordinances.\r\n\r\n[July 30.]\r\n\r\nIt was now near midnight. The messengers returned to St. Cloud, and were\r\nnot permitted to deliver their intelligence until the King awoke next\r\nmorning. Charles then signed the necessary document, and Mortemart set out\r\nfor Paris; but the night's delay had given the Orleanists time to act, and\r\nbefore the King was up Thiers had placarded the streets of Paris with a\r\nproclamation extolling Orleans as the prince devoted to the cause of the\r\nRevolution, as the soldier of Jemappes, and the only constitutional King\r\nnow possible. Some hours after this manifesto had appeared the Deputies\r\nagain assembled at Laffitte's house, and waited for the appearance of\r\nMortemart. But they waited in vain. Mortemart's carriage was stopped on the\r\nroad from St. Cloud, and he was compelled to make his way on foot by a long\r\ncircuit and across a score of barricades. When he approached Laffitte's\r\nhouse, half dead with heat and fatigue, he found that the Deputies had\r\nadjourned to the Palais Bourbon, and, instead of following them, he ended\r\nhis journey at the Luxemburg, where the Peers were assembled. His absence\r\nwas turned to good account by the Orleanists. At the morning session the\r\nproposition was openly made to call Louis Philippe to power; and when the\r\nDeputies reassembled in the afternoon and the Minister still failed to\r\npresent himself, it was resolved to send a body of Peers and Deputies to\r\nLouis Philippe to invite him to come to Paris and to assume the office of\r\nLieutenant-General of the kingdom. No opposition was offered to this\r\nproposal in the House of Peers, and a deputation accordingly set out to\r\nsearch for Louis Philippe at his country house at Neuilly. The prince was\r\nnot to be found; but his sister, who received the deputation, undertook\r\nthat he should duly appear in Paris. She then communicated with her brother\r\nin his hiding-place, and induced him, in spite of the resistance of his\r\nwife, to set out for the capital. He arrived at the Palais Royale late on\r\nthe night of the 30th. Early the next morning he received a deputation from\r\nthe Assembly, and accepted the powers which they offered him. A\r\nproclamation was then published, announcing to the Parisians that in order\r\nto save the country from anarchy and civil war the Duke of Orleans had\r\nassumed the office of Lieutenant-General of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n[The Hôtel de Ville.]\r\n\r\nBut there existed another authority in Paris beside the Assembly of\r\nRepresentatives, and one that was not altogether disposed to permit Louis\r\nPhilippe and his satellites to reap the fruits of the people's victory.\r\nLafayette and the Municipal Committee, which occupied the Hôtel de Ville,\r\nhad transformed themselves into a provisional government, and sat\r\nsurrounded by the armed mob which had captured the Tuileries two days\r\nbefore. No single person who had fought in the streets had risked his life\r\nfor the sake of making Louis Philippe king; in so far as the Parisians had\r\nfought for any definite political idea, they had fought for the Republic.\r\nIt was necessary to reconcile both the populace and the provisional\r\ngovernment to the assumption of power by the new Regent; and with this\r\nobject Louis Philippe himself proceeded to the Hôtel de Ville, accompanied\r\nby an escort of Deputies and Peers. It was a hazardous moment when he\r\nentered the crowd on the Place de Grève; but Louis Philippe's readiness of\r\nspeech stood him in good stead, and he made his way unhurt through the\r\nthrong into the building, where Lafayette received him. Compliments and\r\npromises were showered upon this veteran of 1789, who presently appeared on\r\na balcony and embraced Louis Philippe, while the Prince grasped the\r\ntricolor flag, the flag which had not waved in Paris since 1815. The\r\nspectacle was successful. The multitude shouted applause; and the few\r\ndetermined men who still doubted the sincerity of a Bourbon and demanded\r\nthe proclamation of the Republic were put off with the promise of an\r\nultimate appeal to the French people.\r\n\r\n[Charles X.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Charles X. had withdrawn to Rambouillet, accompanied by the\r\nmembers of his family and by a considerable body of troops. Here the news\r\nreached him that Orleans had accepted from the Chambers the office of\r\nLieutenant-General. It was a severe blow to the old king, who, while others\r\ndoubted of Louis Philippe's loyalty, had still maintained his trust in this\r\nprince's fidelity. For a moment he thought of retiring beyond the Loire and\r\nrisking a civil war; but the troops now began to disperse, and Charles,\r\nrecognising that his cause was hopeless, abdicated together with the\r\nDauphin in favour of his grandson the young Chambord, then called Duc de\r\nBordeaux. He wrote to Louis Philippe, appointing him, as if on his own\r\ninitiative, Lieutenant-General of the kingdom, and required him to proclaim\r\nHenry V. king, and to undertake the government during the new sovereign's\r\nminority. It is doubtful whether Louis Philippe had at this time formed any\r\ndistinct resolve, and whether his answer to Charles X. was inspired by mere\r\ngood nature or by conscious falsehood; for while replying officially that\r\nhe would lay the king's letter before the Chambers, he privately wrote to\r\nCharles X. that he would retain his new office only until he could safely\r\nplace the Duc de Bordeaux upon the throne. Having thus soothed the old\r\nman's pride, Louis Philippe requested him to hasten his departure from the\r\nneighbourhood of Paris; and when Charles ignored the message, he sent out\r\nsome bands of the National Guard to terrify him into flight. This device\r\nsucceeded, and the royal family, still preserving the melancholy ceremonial\r\nof a court, moved slowly through France towards the western coast. At\r\nCherbourg they took ship and crossed to England, where they were received\r\nas private persons. Among the British nation at large the exiled Bourbons\r\nexcited but little sympathy. They were, however, permitted to take up their\r\nabode in the palace of Holyrood, and here Charles X. resided for two years.\r\nBut neither the climate nor the society of the Scottish capital offered any\r\nattraction to the old and failing chief of a fallen dynasty. He sought a\r\nmore congenial shelter in Austria, and died at Goritz in November, 1836.\r\n\r\n[Louis Philippe made King, Aug. 7.]\r\n\r\nThe first public notice of the abdication of King Charles was given by\r\nLouis Philippe in the Chamber of Deputies, which was convoked by him, as\r\nLieutenant-General of the Kingdom, on the 3rd of August. In addressing the\r\nDeputies, Louis Philippe stated that he had received a letter containing\r\nthe abdication both of the King and of the Dauphin, but he uttered no\r\nsingle word regarding the Duc de Bordeaux, in whose favour both his\r\ngrandfather and his uncle had renounced their rights. Had Louis Philippe\r\nmentioned that the abdications were in fact conditional, and had he\r\ndeclared himself protector of the Duc de Bordeaux during his minority,\r\nthere is little doubt that the legitimate heir would have been peaceably\r\naccepted both by the Chamber and by Paris. Louis Philippe himself had up to\r\nthis time done nothing that was inconsistent with the assumption of a mere\r\nRegency; the Chamber had not desired a change of dynasty; and, with the\r\nexception of Lafayette, the men who had actually made the Revolution bore\r\nas little goodwill to an Orleanist as to a Bourbon monarchy. But from the\r\ntime when Louis Philippe passed over in silence the claims of the grandson\r\nof Charles X., his own accession to the throne became inevitable. It was\r\nleft to an obscure Deputy to propose that the crown should be offered to\r\nLouis Philippe, accompanied by certain conditions couched in the form of\r\nmodifications of the Charta. The proposal was carried in the Chamber on the\r\n7th of August, and the whole body of representatives marched to the Palais\r\nRoyale to acquaint the prince with its resolution. Louis Philippe, after\r\nsome conventional expressions of regret, declared that he could not resist\r\nthe call of his country. When the Lower Chamber had thus disposed of the\r\ncrown, the House of Peers, which had proved itself a nullity throughout the\r\ncrisis, adopted the same resolution, and tendered its congratulations in a\r\nsimilar fashion. Two days later Louis Philippe took the oath to the Charta\r\nas modified by the Assembly, and was proclaimed King of the French.\r\n\r\n[Nature of the Revolution of 1830.]\r\n\r\nThus ended a revolution, which, though greeted with enthusiasm at the time,\r\nhas lost much of its splendour and importance in the later judgment of\r\nmankind. In comparison with the Revolution of 1789, the movement which\r\noverthrew the Bourbons in 1830 was a mere flutter on the surface. It was\r\nunconnected with any great change in men's ideas, and it left no great\r\nsocial or legislative changes behind it. Occasioned by a breach of the\r\nconstitution on the part of the Executive Government, it resulted mainly in\r\nthe transfer of administrative power from one set of politicians to\r\nanother: the alterations which it introduced into the constitution itself\r\nwere of no great importance. France neither had an absolute Government\r\nbefore 1830, nor had it a popular Government afterwards. Instead of a\r\nrepresentative of divine right, attended by guards of nobles and counselled\r\nby Jesuit confessors, there was now a citizen-king, who walked about the\r\nstreets of Paris with an umbrella under his arm and sent his sons to the\r\npublic schools, but who had at heart as keen a devotion to dynastic\r\ninterests as either of his predecessors, and a much greater capacity for\r\npersonal rule. The bonds which kept the entire local administration of\r\nFrance in dependence upon the central authority were not loosened;\r\nofficialism remained as strong as ever; the franchise was still limited to\r\na mere fraction of the nation. On the other hand, within the administration\r\nitself the change wrought by the July Revolution was real and lasting. It\r\nextinguished the political power of the clerical interest. Not only were\r\nthe Bishops removed from the House of Peers, but throughout all departments\r\nof Government the influence of the clergy, which had been so strong under\r\nCharles X., vanished away. The State took a distinctly secular colour. The\r\nsystem of public education was regulated with such police-like\r\nexclusiveness that priests who insisted upon opening schools of their own\r\nfor Catholic teaching were enabled to figure as champions of civil liberty\r\nand of freedom of opinion against despotic power. The noblesse lost\r\nwhatever political influence it had regained during the Restoration. The\r\nfew surviving Regicides who had been banished in 1815 were recalled to\r\nFrance, among them the terrorist Barrère, who was once more returned to the\r\nAssembly. But the real winners in the Revolution of 1830 were not the men\r\nof extremes, but the middle-class of France. This was the class which Louis\r\nPhilippe truly represented; and the force which for eighteen years kept\r\nLouis Philippe on the throne was the middle-class force of the National\r\nGuard of Paris. Against this sober, prosaic, unimaginative power there\r\nstruggled the hot and restless spirit which had been let loose by the\r\noverthrow of the Bourbon dynasty, and which, fired at once with the\r\npolitical ideal of a Republic, with dreams of the regeneration of Europe by\r\nFrench armies, and with the growing antagonism between the labouring class\r\nand the owners of property, threatened for awhile to overthrow the\r\nnewly-constituted monarchy in France, and to plunge Europe into war. The\r\nreturn of the tricolor flag, the long-silenced strains of the Republic and\r\nthe Empire, the sense of victory with which men on the popular side\r\nwitnessed the expulsion of the dynasty which had been forced upon France\r\nafter Waterloo, revived that half-romantic military ardour which had\r\nundertaken the liberation of Europe in 1792. France appeared once more in\r\nthe eyes of enthusiasts as the deliverer of nations. The realities of the\r\npast epoch of French military aggression, its robberies, its corruption,\r\nthe execrations of its victims, were forgotten; and when one people after\r\nanother took up the shout of liberty that was raised in Paris, and\r\ninsurrections broke out in every quarter of Europe, it was with difficulty\r\nthat Louis Philippe and the few men of caution about him could prevent the\r\nFrench nation from rushing into war.\r\n\r\n[Affairs in Belgium.]\r\n\r\nThe State first affected by the events of July was the kingdom of the\r\nNetherlands. The creation of this kingdom, in which the Belgian provinces\r\nformerly subject to Austria were united with Holland to serve as an\r\neffective barrier against French aggression on the north, had been one of\r\nPitt's most cherished schemes, and it had been carried into effect ten\r\nyears after his death by the Congress of Vienna. National and religious\r\nincongruities had been little considered by the statesmen of that day, and\r\nat the very moment of union the Catholic bishops of Belgium had protested\r\nagainst a constitution which gave equal toleration to all religions under\r\nthe rule of a Protestant King. The Belgians had been uninterruptedly united\r\nwith France for the twenty years preceding 1814; the French language was\r\nnot only the language of their literature, but the spoken language of the\r\nupper classes; and though the Flemish portion of the population was nearly\r\nrelated to the Dutch, this element had not then asserted itself with the\r\ndistinctness and energy which it has since developed. The antagonism\r\nbetween the northern and the southern Netherlands, though not insuperable,\r\nwas sufficiently great to make a harmonious union between the two countries\r\na work of difficulty, and the Government of The Hague had not taken the\r\nright course to conciliate its opponents. The Belgians, though more\r\nnumerous, were represented by fewer members in the National Assembly than\r\nthe Dutch. Offices were filled by strangers from Holland; finance was\r\ngoverned by a regard for Dutch interests; and the Dutch language was made\r\nthe official language for the whole kingdom. But the chief grievances were\r\nundoubtedly connected with the claims of the clerical party in Belgium to a\r\nmonopoly of spiritual power and the exclusive control of education. The one\r\nreally irreconcilable enemy of the Protestant House of Orange was the\r\nChurch; and the governing impulse in the conflicts which preceded the\r\ndissolution of the kingdom of the Netherlands in 1830 sprang from the same\r\nclerical interest which had thrown Belgium into revolt against the Emperor\r\nJoseph forty years before. There was again seen the same strange phenomenon\r\nof a combination between the Church and a popular or even revolutionary\r\nparty. For the sake of an alliance against a constitution distasteful to\r\nboth, the clergy of Belgium accepted the democratic principles of the\r\npolitical Opposition, and the Opposition consented for a while to desist\r\nfrom their attacks upon the Papacy. The contract was faithfully observed on\r\nboth sides until the object for which it was made was attained. [388]\r\n\r\n[Belgian Revolution, August, 1830.]\r\n\r\nFor some months before the Revolution of July, 1830, the antagonism between\r\nthe Belgians and their Government had been so violent that no great shock\r\nfrom outside was necessary to produce an outbreak. The convulsions of Paris\r\nwere at once felt at Brussels, and on the 25th of August the performance of\r\na revolutionary opera in that city gave the signal for the commencement of\r\ninsurrection. From the capital the rebellion spread from town to town\r\nthroughout the southern Netherlands. The King summoned the Estates General,\r\nand agreed to the establishment of an administration for Belgium separate\r\nfrom that of Holland: but the storm was not allayed; and the appearance of\r\na body of Dutch troops at Brussels was sufficient to dispel the expectation\r\nof a peaceful settlement. Barricades were erected; a conflict took place in\r\nthe streets; and the troops, unable to carry the city by assault, retired\r\nto the outskirts and kept up a desultory attack for several days. They then\r\nwithdrew, and a provisional government, which was immediately established,\r\ndeclared the independence of Belgium. For a moment there appeared some\r\npossibility that the Crown Prince of Holland, who had from the first\r\nassumed the part of mediator, might be accepted as sovereign of the\r\nnewly-formed State; but the growing violence of the insurrection, the\r\nactivity of French emissaries and volunteers, and the bombardment of\r\nAntwerp by the Dutch soldiers who garrisoned its citadel, made an end of\r\nall such hopes. Belgium had won its independence, and its connection with\r\nthe House of Orange could be re-established only by force of arms.\r\n\r\n[France and the Belgian Revolution.]\r\n\r\n[France and England.]\r\n\r\nThe accomplishment of this revolution in one of the smallest Continental\r\nStates threatened to involve all Europe in war. Though not actually\r\neffected under the auspices of a French army, it was undoubtedly to some\r\nextent effected in alliance with the French revolutionary party. It broke\r\nup a kingdom established by the European Treaties of 1814; and it was so\r\nclosely connected with the overthrow of the Bourbon monarchy as to be\r\nscarcely distinguishable from those cases in which the European Powers had\r\npledged themselves to call their armies into the field. Louis Philippe,\r\nhowever, had been recognised by most of the European Courts as the only\r\npossible alternative to a French Republic; and a general disposition\r\nexisted to second any sincere effort that should be made by him to prevent\r\nthe French nation from rushing into war. This was especially the case with\r\nEngland; and it was to England that Louis Philippe turned for co-operation\r\nin the settlement of the Belgian question. Louis Philippe himself had every\r\npossible reason for desiring to keep the peace. If war broke out, France\r\nwould be opposed to all the Continental Powers together. Success was in the\r\nlast degree improbable; it could only be hoped for by a revival of the\r\nrevolutionary methods and propaganda of 1793; and failure, even for a\r\nmoment, would certainly cost him his throne, and possibly his life. His\r\ninterest no less than his temperament made him the strenuous, though\r\nconcealed, opponent of the war-party in the Assembly; and he found in the\r\nold diplomatist who had served alike under the Bourbons, the Republic, and\r\nthe Empire, an ally thoroughly capable of pursuing his own wise though\r\nunpopular policy of friendship and co-operation with England. Talleyrand,\r\nwhile others were crying for a revenge for Waterloo, saw that the first\r\nnecessity for France was to rescue it from its isolation; and as at the\r\nCongress of Vienna he had detached Austria and England from the two\r\nnorthern Courts, so now, before attempting to gain any extension of\r\nterritory, he sought to make France safe against the hostility of the\r\nContinent by allying it with at least one great Power. Russia had become an\r\nenemy instead of a friend. The expulsion of the Bourbons had given mortal\r\noffence to the Czar Nicholas, and neither Austria nor Prussia was likely to\r\nenter into close relations with a Government founded upon revolution.\r\nEngland alone seemed a possible ally, and it was to England that the French\r\nstatesman of peace turned in the Belgian crisis. Talleyrand, now nearly\r\neighty years old, came as ambassador to London, where he had served in\r\n1792. He addressed himself to Wellington and to the new King, William IV.,\r\nassuring them that, under the Government of Louis Philippe, France would\r\nnot seek to use the Belgian revolution for its own aggrandisement; and,\r\nwith his old aptness in the invention of general principles to suit a\r\nparticular case, he laid down the principle of non-intervention as one that\r\nought for the future to govern the policy of Europe. His efforts were\r\nsuccessful. So complete an understanding was established between France and\r\nEngland on the Belgian question, that all fear of an armed intervention of\r\nthe Eastern Courts on behalf of the King of Holland, which would have\r\nrendered a war with France inevitable, passed away. The regulation of\r\nBelgian affairs was submitted to a Conference at London. Hostilities were\r\nstopped, and the independence of the new kingdom was recognised in\r\nprinciple by the Conference before the end of the year. A Protocol defining\r\nthe frontiers of Belgium and Holland, and apportioning to each State its\r\nshare in the national debt, was signed by the representatives of the Powers\r\nin January, 1831. [389]\r\n\r\n[Leopold elected King, June 4.]\r\n\r\nThus far, a crisis which threatened the peace of Europe had been surmounted\r\nwith unexpected ease. But the first stage of the difficulty alone was\r\npassed; it still remained for the Powers to provide a king for Belgium, and\r\nto gain the consent of the Dutch and Belgian Governments to the territorial\r\narrangements drawn up for them. The Belgians themselves, with whom a\r\nconnection with France was popular, were disposed to elect as their\r\nsovereign the Duc de Nemours, second son of Louis Philippe; and although\r\nLouis Philippe officially refused his sanction to this scheme, which in the\r\neyes of all Europe would have turned Belgium into a French dependency, he\r\nprivately encouraged its prosecution after a Bonapartist candidate, the son\r\nof Eugène Beauharnais, had appeared in the field. The result was that the\r\nDuc de Nemours was elected king on the 3rd of February, 1831. Against this\r\nappointment the Conference of the Powers at London had already pronounced\r\nits veto, and the British Government let it be understood that it would\r\nresist any such extension of French influence by force. Louis Philippe now\r\nfinally refused the crown for his son, and, the Bonapartist candidate being\r\nwithdrawn, the two rival Powers agreed in recommending Prince Leopold of\r\nSaxe-Coburg, on the understanding that, if elected King of Belgium, he\r\nshould marry a daughter of Louis Philippe. The Belgians fell in with the\r\nadvice given them, and elected Leopold on the 4th of June. He accepted the\r\ncrown, subject to the condition that the London Conference should modify in\r\nfavour of Belgium some of the provisions relating to the frontiers and to\r\nthe finances of the new State which had been laid down by the Conference,\r\nand which the Belgian Government had hitherto refused to accept.\r\n\r\n[Settlement of the Belgian frontier.]\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of arranging the Belgian frontier arose principally from the\r\nposition of the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg. This territory, though subject to\r\nAustria before the French Revolution, had always been treated as distinct\r\nfrom the body of the Austrian Netherlands. When, at the peace of 1814, it\r\nwas given to the King of Holland in substitution for the ancient\r\npossessions of his family at Nassau, its old character as a member of the\r\nGerman federal union was restored to it, so that the King of Holland in\r\nrespect of this portion of his dominions became a German prince, and the\r\nfortress of Luxemburg, the strongest in Europe after Gibraltar, was liable\r\nto occupation by German troops. The population of the Duchy had, however,\r\njoined the Belgians in their revolt, and, with the exception of the\r\nfortress itself, the territory had passed into possession of the Belgian\r\nGovernment. In spite of this actual overthrow of Dutch rule, the Conference\r\nof London had attached such preponderating importance to the military and\r\ninternational relations of Luxemburg that it had excluded the whole of the\r\nDuchy from the new Belgian State, and declared it still to form part of the\r\ndominions of the King of Holland. The first demand of Leopold was for the\r\nreversal or modification of this decision, and the Powers so far gave way\r\nas to substitute for the declaration of January a series of articles, in\r\nwhich the question of Luxemburg was reserved for future settlement. The\r\nKing of Holland had assented to the January declaration; on hearing of its\r\nabandonment, he took up arms, and threw fifty thousand men into Belgium.\r\nLeopold appealed to France for assistance, and a French army immediately\r\ncrossed the frontier. The Dutch now withdrew, and the French in their turn\r\nwere recalled, after Leopold had signed a treaty undertaking to raze the\r\nfortifications of five towns on his southern border. The Conference again\r\ntook up its work, and produced a third scheme, in which the territory of\r\nLuxemburg was divided between Holland and Belgium. This was accepted by\r\nBelgium, and rejected by Holland. The consequence was that a treaty was\r\nmade between Leopold and the Powers; and at the beginning of 1832 the\r\nkingdom of Belgium, as defined by the third award of the Conference, was\r\nrecognised by all the Courts, Lord Palmerston on behalf of England\r\nresolutely refusing to France even the slightest addition of territory, on\r\nthe ground that, if annexations once began, all security for the\r\ncontinuance of peace would be at an end. On this wise and firm policy the\r\nconcert of Europe in the establishment of the Belgian kingdom was\r\nsuccessfully maintained; and it only remained for the Western Powers to\r\novercome the resistance of the King of Holland, who still held the citadel\r\nof Antwerp and declined to listen either to reason or authority. A French\r\narmy corps was charged with the task of besieging the citadel; an English\r\nfleet blockaded the river Scheldt. After a severe bombardment the citadel\r\nsurrendered. Hostilities ceased, and negotiations for a definitive\r\nsettlement recommenced. As, however, the Belgians were in actual occupation\r\nof all Luxemburg with the exception of the fortress, they had no motive to\r\naccelerate a settlement which would deprive them of part of their existing\r\npossessions; on the other hand, the King of Holland held back through mere\r\nobstinacy. Thus the provisional state of affairs was prolonged for year\r\nafter year, and it was not until April, 1839, that the final Treaty of\r\nPeace between Belgium and Holland was executed.\r\n\r\n[Affairs of Poland.]\r\n\r\nThe consent of the Eastern Powers to the overthrow of the kingdom of the\r\nUnited Netherlands, and to the establishment of a State based upon a\r\nrevolutionary movement, would probably have been harder to gain if in the\r\nautumn of 1830 Russia had been free to act with all its strength. But at\r\nthis moment an outbreak took place in Poland, which required the\r\nconcentration of all the Czar's forces within his own border. The conflict\r\nwas rather a war of one armed nation against another than the insurrection\r\nof a people against its government. Poland--that is to say, the territory\r\nwhich had formerly constituted the Grand Duchy of Warsaw--had, by the\r\ntreaties of 1814, been established as a separate kingdom, subject to the\r\nCzar of Russia, but not forming part of the Russian Empire. It possessed an\r\nadministration and an army of its own, and the meetings of its Diet gave to\r\nit a species of parliamentary government to which there was nothing\r\nanalogous within Russia proper. During the reign of Alexander the\r\nconstitutional system of Poland had, on the whole, been respected; and\r\nalthough the real supremacy of an absolute monarch at St. Petersburg had\r\ncaused the Diet to act as a body in opposition to the Russian Government,\r\nthe personal connection existing between Alexander and the Poles had\r\nprevented any overt rebellion during his own life-time. But with the\r\naccession of Nicholas all such individual sympathy passed away, and the\r\nhard realities of the actual relation between Poland and the Court of\r\nRussia came into full view. In the conspiracies of 1825 a great number of\r\nPoles were implicated. Eight of these persons, after a preliminary inquiry,\r\nwere placed on trial before the Senate at Warsaw, which, in spite of strong\r\nevidence of their guilt, acquitted them. Pending the decision, Nicholas\r\ndeclined to convoke the Diet: he also stationed Russian troops in Poland,\r\nand violated the constitution by placing Russians in all branches of the\r\nadministration. Even without these grievances the hostility of the mass of\r\nthe Polish noblesse to Russia would probably have led sooner or later to\r\ninsurrection. The peasantry, ignorant and degraded, were but instruments in\r\nthe hands of their territorial masters. In so far as Poland had rights of\r\nself-government, these rights belonged almost exclusively to the nobles, or\r\nlanded proprietors, a class so numerous that they have usually been\r\nmistaken in Western Europe for the Polish nation itself. The so-called\r\nemancipation of the serfs, effected by Napoleon after wresting the Grand\r\nDuchy of Warsaw from Prussia in 1807, had done little for the mass of the\r\npopulation; for, while abolishing the legal condition of servitude,\r\nNapoleon had given the peasant no vestige of proprietorship in his holding,\r\nand had consequently left him as much at the mercy of his landlord as he\r\nwas before. The name of freedom appears in fact to have worked actual\r\ninjury to the peasant; for in the enjoyment of a pretended power of free\r\ncontract he was left without that protection of the officers of State\r\nwhich, under the Prussian regime from 1795 to 1807, had shielded him from\r\nthe tyranny of his lord. It has been the fatal, the irremediable bane of\r\nPoland that its noblesse, until too late, saw no country, no right, no law,\r\noutside itself. The very measures of interference on the part of the Czar\r\nwhich this caste resented as unconstitutional were in part directed against\r\nthe abuse of its own privileges; and although in 1830 a section of the\r\nnobles had learnt the secret of their country's fall, and were prepared to\r\ngive the serf the real emancipation of proprietorship, no universal impulse\r\nworked in this direction, nor could the wrong of ages be undone in the\r\ntumult of war and revolution.\r\n\r\n[Insurrection at Warsaw, Nov. 29.]\r\n\r\nA sharp distinction existed between the narrow circle of the highest\r\naristocracy of Poland and the mass of the poor and warlike noblesse. The\r\nformer, represented by men like Czartoryski, the friend of Alexander I. and\r\nex-Minister of Russia, understood the hopelessness of any immediate\r\nstruggle with the superior power, and advocated the politic development of\r\nsuch national institutions as were given to Poland by the constitution of\r\n1815, institutions which were certainly sufficient to preserve Poland from\r\nabsorption by Russia, and to keep alive the idea of the ultimate\r\nestablishment of its independence. It was among the lesser nobility, among\r\nthe subordinate officers of the army and the population of Warsaw itself,\r\nwho jointly formed the so-called democratic party, that the spirit of\r\nrevolt was strongest. Plans for an outbreak had been made during the\r\nTurkish war of 1828; but unhappily this opportunity, which might have been\r\nused with fatal effect against Russia, was neglected, and it was left for\r\nthe French Revolution of 1830 to kindle an untimely and ineffective flame.\r\nThe memory of Napoleon's campaigns and the wild voices of French democracy\r\nfilled the patriots at Warsaw with vain hopes of a military union with\r\nwestern Liberalism, and overpowered the counsels of men who understood the\r\nstate of Europe better. Revolt broke out on the 29th of November, 1830. The\r\nPolish regiments in Warsaw joined the insurrection, and the Russian troops,\r\nunder the Grand Duke Constantine, withdrew from the capital, where their\r\nleader had narrowly escaped with his life. [390]\r\n\r\n[Attempted negotiation with the Czar.]\r\n\r\nThe Government of Poland had up to this time been in the hands of a Council\r\nnominated by the Czar as King of Poland, and controlled by instructions\r\nfrom a secretary at St. Petersburg. The chief of the Council was Lubecki, a\r\nPole devoted to the Emperor Nicholas. On the victory of the insurrection at\r\nWarsaw, the Council was dissolved and a provisional Government installed.\r\nThough the revolt was the work of the so-called democratic party, the\r\ninfluence of the old governing families of the highest aristocracy was\r\nstill so great that power was by common consent placed in their hands.\r\nCzartoryski became president, and the policy adopted by himself and his\r\ncolleagues was that of friendly negotiation with Russia. The insurrection\r\nof November was treated not as the beginning of a national revolt, but as a\r\nmere disturbance occasioned by unconstitutional acts of the Government. So\r\nlittle did the committee understand the character of the Emperor Nicholas,\r\nas to imagine that after the expulsion of his soldiers and the overthrow of\r\nhis Ministers at Warsaw he would peaceably make the concessions required of\r\nhim, and undertake for the future faithfully to observe the Polish\r\nconstitution. Lubecki and a second official were sent to St. Petersburg to\r\npresent these demands, and further (though this was not seriously intended)\r\nto ask that the constitution should be introduced into all the Russian\r\nprovinces which had once formed part of the Polish State. The reception\r\ngiven to the envoys at the frontier was of an ominous character. They were\r\nrequired to describe themselves as officers about to present a report to\r\nthe Czar, inasmuch as no representatives of rebels in arms could be\r\nreceived into Russia. Lubecki appears now to have shaken the dust of Poland\r\noff his feet; his colleague pursued his mission, and was admitted to the\r\nCzar's presence. Nicholas, while expressing himself in language of injured\r\ntenderness, and disclaiming all desire to punish the innocent with the\r\nguilty, let it be understood that Poland had but two alternatives,\r\nunconditional submission or annihilation. The messenger who in the\r\nmeanwhile carried back to Warsaw the first despatches of the envoy reported\r\nthat the roads were already filled with Russian regiments moving on their\r\nprey.\r\n\r\n[Diebitsch invades Poland, Feb. 1831.]\r\n\r\nSix weeks of precious time were lost through the illusion of the Polish\r\nGovernment that an accommodation with the Emperor Nicholas was possible.\r\nHad the insurrection at Warsaw been instantly followed by a general levy\r\nand the invasion of Lithuania, the resources of this large province might\r\npossibly have been thrown into the scale against Russia. Though the mass of\r\nthe Lithuanian population, in spite or several centuries of union with\r\nPoland, had never been assimilated to the dominant race, and remained in\r\nlanguage and creed more nearly allied to the Russians than the Poles, the\r\nnobles formed an integral part of the Polish nation, and possessed\r\nsufficient power over their serfs to drive them into the field to fight for\r\nthey knew not what. The Russian garrisons in Lithuania were not strong, and\r\nmight easily have been overpowered by a sudden attack. When once the\r\npopulation of Warsaw had risen in arms against Nicholas, the only\r\npossibility of success lay in the extension of the revolt over the whole of\r\nthe semi-Polish provinces, and in a general call to arms. But beside other\r\nconsiderations which disinclined the higher aristocracy at Warsaw to\r\nextreme measures, they were influenced by a belief that the Powers of\r\nEurope might intervene on behalf of the constitution of the Polish kingdom\r\nas established by the treaty of Vienna; while, if the struggle passed\r\nbeyond the borders of that kingdom, it would become a revolutionary\r\nmovement to which no Court could lend its support. It was not until the\r\nenvoy returned from St. Petersburg bearing the answer of the Emperor\r\nNicholas that the democratic party carried all before it, and all hopes of\r\na peaceful compromise vanished away. The Diet then passed a resolution\r\ndeclaring that the House of Romanoff had forfeited the Polish crown, and\r\npreparations began for a struggle for life or death with Russia. But the\r\nfirst moments when Russia stood unguarded and unready had been lost beyond\r\nrecall. Troops had thronged westwards into Lithuania; the garrisons in the\r\nfortresses had been raised to their full strength; and in February, 1831,\r\nDiebitsch took up the offensive, and crossed the Polish frontier with a\r\nhundred and twenty thousand men.\r\n\r\n[Campaign in Poland, 1831.]\r\n\r\n[Capture of Warsaw, Sept. 8, 1831.]\r\n\r\nThe Polish army, though far inferior in numbers to the enemy which it had\r\nto meet, was no contemptible foe. Among its officers there were many who\r\nhad served in Napoleon's campaigns; it possessed, however, no general\r\nhabituated to independent command; and the spirit of insubordination and\r\nself-will, which had wrought so much ruin in Poland, was still ready to\r\nbreak out when defeat had impaired the authority of the nominal chiefs. In\r\nthe first encounters the advancing Russian army was gallantly met; and,\r\nalthough the Poles were forced to fall back upon Warsaw, the losses\r\nsustained by Diebitsch were so serious that he had to stay his operations\r\nand to wait for reinforcements. In March the Poles took up the offensive\r\nand surprised several isolated divisions of the enemy; their general,\r\nhowever, failed to push his advantages with the necessary energy and\r\nswiftness; the junction of the Russians was at length effected, and on the\r\n26th of May the Poles were defeated after obstinate resistance in a pitched\r\nbattle at Ostrolenka. Cholera now broke out in the Russian camp. Both\r\nDiebitsch and the Grand Duke Constantine were carried off in the midst of\r\nthe campaign, and some months more were added to the struggle of Poland,\r\nhopeless as this had now become. Incursions were made into Lithuania and\r\nPodolia, but without result. Paskiewitch, the conqueror of Kars, was called\r\nup to take the post left vacant by the death of his rival. New masses of\r\nRussian troops came in place of those who had perished in battle and in the\r\nhospitals; and while the Governments of Western Europe lifted no hand on\r\nbehalf of Polish independence, Prussia, alarmed lest the revolt should\r\nspread into its own Polish provinces, assisted the operations of the\r\nRussian general by supplying stores and munition of war. Blow after blow\r\nfell upon the Polish cause. Warsaw itself became the prey of disorder,\r\nintrigue, and treachery; and at length the Russian army made its entrance\r\ninto the capital, and the last soldiers of Poland laid down their arms, or\r\ncrossed into Prussian or Austrian territory. The revolt had been rashly and\r\nunwisely begun: its results were fatal and lamentable. The constitution of\r\nPoland was abolished; it ceased to be a separate kingdom, and became a\r\nprovince of the Russian Empire. Its defenders were exiles over the face of\r\nEurope or forgotten in Siberia. All that might have been won by the gradual\r\ndevelopment of its constitutional liberties without breach with the Czar's\r\nsovereignty was sacrificed. The future of Poland, like that of Russia\r\nitself, now depended on the enlightenment and courage of the Imperial\r\nGovernment, and on that alone. The very existence of a Polish nationality\r\nand language seemed for a while to be threatened by the measures of\r\nrepression that followed the victory of 1831: and if it be true that\r\nRussian autocracy has at length done for the Polish peasants what their\r\nnative masters during centuries of ascendency refused to do, this\r\nemancipation would probably not have come the later for the preservation of\r\nsome relics of political independence, nor would it have had the less value\r\nif unaccompanied by the proscription of so great a part of that class which\r\nhad once been held to constitute the Polish nation. [391]\r\n\r\n[Insurrection in the Papal States, Feb., 1831.]\r\n\r\nDuring the conflict on the banks of the Vistula, the attitude of the\r\nAustrian Government had been one of watchful neutrality. Its own Polish\r\nterritory was not seriously menaced with disturbance, for in a great part\r\nof Galicia the population, being of Ruthenian stock and belonging to the\r\nGreek Church, had nothing in common with the Polish and Catholic noblesse\r\nof their province, and looked back upon the days of Polish dominion as a\r\ntime of suffering and wrong. Austria's danger in any period of European\r\nconvulsion lay as yet rather on the side of Italy than on the East, and the\r\nvigour of its policy in that quarter contrasted with the equanimity with\r\nwhich it watched the struggle of its Slavic neighbours. Since the\r\nsuppression of the Neapolitan constitutional movement in 1821, the\r\nCarbonari and other secret societies of Italy had lost nothing of their\r\nactivity. Their head-quarters had been removed from Southern Italy to the\r\nPapal States, and the numerous Italian exiles in France and elsewhere kept\r\nup a busy communication at once with French revolutionary leaders like\r\nLafayette and with the enemies of the established governments in Italy\r\nitself. The death of Pope Pius VIII., on November 30, 1830, and the\r\nconsequent paralysis of authority within the Ecclesiastical States, came at\r\nan opportune moment; assurances of support arrived from Paris; and the\r\nItalian leaders resolved upon a general insurrection throughout the minor\r\nPrincipalities on the 5th of February, 1831. Anticipating the signal,\r\nMenotti, chief of a band of patriots at Modena, who appears to have been\r\nlured on by the Grand Duke himself, assembled his partisans on February 3.\r\nHe was overpowered and imprisoned; but the outbreak of the insurrection in\r\nBologna, and its rapid extension over the northern part of the Papal\r\nStates, soon caused the Grand Duke to fly to Austrian territory, carrying\r\nhis prisoner Menotti with him, whom he subsequently put to death. The new\r\nPope, Gregory XVI., had scarcely been elected when the report reached him\r\nthat Bologna had declared the temporal power of the Papacy to be at an end.\r\nUncertain of the character of the revolt, he despatched Cardinal Benvenuti\r\nnorthwards, to employ conciliation or force as occasion might require. The\r\nLegate fell into the hands of the insurgents; the revolt spread southwards;\r\nand Gregory, now hopeless of subduing it by the forces at his own command,\r\ncalled upon Austria for assistance. [392]\r\n\r\n[Attitude of France.]\r\n\r\nThe principle which, since the Revolution of July, the government of France\r\nhad repeatedly laid down as the future basis of European politics was that\r\nof non-intervention. It had disclaimed any purpose of interfering with the\r\naffairs of its neighbours, and had required in return that no foreign\r\nintervention should take place in districts which, like Belgium and Savoy,\r\nadjoined its own frontier. But there existed no real unity of purpose in\r\nthe councils of Louis Philippe. The Ministry had one voice for the\r\nrepresentatives of foreign powers, another for the Chamber of Deputies, and\r\nanother for Lafayette and the bands of exiles and conspirators who were\r\nunder his protection. The head of the government at the beginning of 1831\r\nwas Laffitte, a weak politician, dominated by revolutionary sympathies and\r\nphrases, but incapable of any sustained or resolute action, and equally\r\nincapable of resisting Louis Philippe after the King had concluded his\r\nperformance of popular leader, and assumed his real character as the wary\r\nand self-seeking chief of a reigning house. Whether the actual course of\r\nFrench policy would be governed by the passions of the streets or by the\r\ntimorousness of Louis Philippe was from day to day a matter of conjecture.\r\nThe official answer given to the inquiries of the Austrian ambassador as to\r\nthe intentions of France in case of an Austrian intervention in Italy was,\r\nthat such intervention might be tolerated in Parma and Modena, which\r\nbelonged to sovereigns immediately connected with the Hapsburgs, but that\r\nif it was extended to the Papal States war with France would be probable,\r\nand if extended to Piedmont, certain. On this reply Metternich, who saw\r\nAustria's own dominion in Italy once more menaced by the success of an\r\ninsurrectionary movement, had to form his decision. He could count on the\r\nsupport of Russia in case of war; he knew well the fears of Louis Philippe,\r\nand knew that he could work on these fears both by pointing to the presence\r\nof the young Louis Bonaparte and his brother with the Italian insurgents as\r\nevidence of the Bonapartist character of the movement, and by hinting that\r\nin the last resort he might himself let loose upon France Napoleon's son,\r\nthe Duke of Reichstadt, now growing to manhood at Vienna, before whom Louis\r\nPhilippe's throne would have collapsed as speedily as that of Louis XVIII.\r\nin 1814. Where weakness existed, Metternich was quick to divine it and to\r\ntake advantage of it. He rightly gauged Louis Philippe. Taking at their\r\ntrue value the threats of the French Government, he declared that it was\r\nbetter for Austria to fall, if necessary, by war than by revolution; and,\r\nresolving at all hazards to suppress the Roman insurrection, he gave orders\r\nto the Austrian troops to enter the Papal States.\r\n\r\n[Austrians suppress Roman revolt, March, 1831.]\r\n\r\n[Casimir Perier, March, 1831.]\r\n\r\nThe military resistance which the insurgents could offer to the advance of\r\nthe Pope's Austrian deliverers was insignificant, and order was soon\r\nrestored. But all Europe expected the outbreak of war between Austria and\r\nFrance. The French ambassador at Constantinople had gone so far as to offer\r\nthe Sultan an offensive and defensive alliance, and to urge him to make\r\npreparations for an attack upon both Austria and Russia on their southern\r\nfrontiers. A despatch from the ambassador reached Paris describing the\r\nwarlike overtures he had made to the Porte. Louis Philippe saw that if this\r\ndespatch reached the hands of Laffitte and the war party in the Council of\r\nMinisters the preservation of peace would be almost impossible. In concert\r\nwith Sebastiani, the Foreign Minister, he concealed the despatch from\r\nLaffitte. The Premier discovered the trick that had been played upon him,\r\nand tendered his resignation. It was gladly accepted by Louis Philippe.\r\nLaffitte quitted office, begging pardon of God and man for the part that he\r\nhad taken in raising Louis Philippe to the throne. His successor was\r\nCasimir Perier, a man of very different mould; resolute, clear-headed, and\r\nimmovably true to his word; a constitutional statesman of the strictest\r\ntype, intolerant of any species of disorder, and a despiser of popular\r\nmovements, but equally proof against royal intrigues, and as keen to\r\nmaintain the constitutional system of France against the Court on one side\r\nand the populace on the other as he was to earn for France the respect of\r\nforeign powers by the abandonment of a policy of adventure, and the steady\r\nadherence to the principles of international obligation which he had laid\r\ndown. Under his firm hand the intrigues of the French Government with\r\nforeign revolutionists ceased; it was felt throughout Europe that peace was\r\nstill possible, and that if war was undertaken by France it would be\r\nundertaken only under conditions which would make any moral union of all\r\nthe great Powers against France impossible. The Austrian expedition into\r\nthe Papal States had already begun, and the revolutionary Government had\r\nbeen suppressed; the most therefore that Casimir Perier could demand was\r\nthat the evacuation of the occupied territory should take place as soon as\r\npossible, and that Austria should add its voice to that of the other Powers\r\nin urging the Papal Government to reform its abuses. Both demands were\r\ngranted. For the first time Austria appeared as the advocate of something\r\nlike a constitutional system. A Conference held at Rome agreed upon a\r\nscheme of reforms to be recommended to the Pope; the prospects of peace\r\ngrew daily fairer; and in July, 1831, the last Austrian soldiers quitted\r\nthe Ecclesiastical States. [393]\r\n\r\n[Second Austrian intervention, Jan., 1832.]\r\n\r\n[French occupy Ancona, February, 1832.]\r\n\r\nIt now remained to be seen whether Pope Gregory and his cardinals had the\r\nintelligence and good-will necessary for carrying out the reforms on the\r\npromise of which France had abstained from active intervention. If any such\r\nhopes existed they were doomed to speedy disappointment. The apparatus of\r\npriestly maladministration was restored in all its ancient deformity. An\r\namnesty which had been promised by the Legate Benvenuti was disregarded,\r\nand the Pope set himself to strengthen his authority by enlisting new bands\r\nof ruffians and adventurers under the standard of St. Peter. Again\r\ninsurrection broke out, and again at the Pope's request the Austrians\r\ncrossed the frontier (January, 1832). Though their appearance was fatal to\r\nthe cause of liberty, they were actually welcomed as protectors in towns\r\nwhich had been exposed to the tender mercies of the Papal condottieri.\r\nThere was no disorder, no severity, where the Austrian commandants held\r\nsway; but their mere presence in central Italy was a threat to European\r\npeace; and Casimir Perier was not the man to permit Austria to dominate in\r\nItaly at its will. Without waiting for negotiations, he despatched a French\r\nforce to Ancona, and seized this town before the Austrians could approach\r\nit. The rival Powers were now face to face in Italy; but Perier had no\r\nintention of forcing on war if his opponent was still willing to keep the\r\npeace. Austria accepted the situation, and made no attempt to expel the\r\nFrench from the position they had seized. Casimir Perier, now on his\r\ndeath-bed, defended the step that he had taken against the remonstrances of\r\nambassadors and against the protests of the Pope, and declared the presence\r\nof the French at Ancona to be no incentive to rebellion, but the mere\r\nassertion of the rights of a Power which had as good a claim to be in\r\ncentral Italy as Austria itself. Had his life been prolonged, he would\r\nprobably have insisted upon the execution of the reforms which the Powers\r\nhad urged upon the Papal government, and have made the occupation of Ancona\r\nan effectual means for reaching this end. But with his death the wrongs of\r\nthe Italians themselves and the question of a reformed government in the\r\nPapal States gradually passed out of sight. France and Austria jealously\r\nwatched one another on the debatable land; the occupation became a mere\r\nincident of the balance of power, and was prolonged for year after year,\r\nuntil, in 1838, the Austrians having finally withdrawn all their troops,\r\nthe French peacefully handed over the citadel of Ancona to the Holy See.\r\n\r\n[Prussia in 1830.]\r\n\r\n[The Zollverein, 1828-1836.]\r\n\r\nThe arena in which we have next to follow the effects of the July\r\nRevolution, in action and counter-action, is Germany. It has been seen that\r\nin the southern German States an element of representative government, if\r\nweak, yet not wholly ineffective, had come into being soon after 1815, and\r\nhad survived the reactionary measures initiated by the conference of\r\nMinisters at Carlsbad. In Prussia the promises of King Frederick William to\r\nhis people had never been fulfilled. Years had passed since exaggerated\r\nrumours of conspiracy had served as an excuse for withholding the\r\nConstitution. Hardenberg had long been dead; the foreign policy of the\r\ncountry had taken a freer tone; the rigours of the police-system had\r\ndeparted; but the nation remained as completely excluded from any share in\r\nthe government as it had been before Napoleon's fall. It had in fact become\r\nclear that during the lifetime of King Frederick William things must be\r\nallowed to remain in their existing condition; and the affection of the\r\npeople for their sovereign, who had been so long and so closely united with\r\nPrussia in its sufferings and in its glories, caused a general willingness\r\nto postpone the demand for constitutional reform until the succeeding\r\nreign. The substantial merits of the administration might moreover have\r\nreconciled a less submissive people than the Prussians to the absolute\r\ngovernment under which they lived. Under a wise and enlightened financial\r\npolicy the country was becoming visibly richer. Obstacles to commercial\r\ndevelopment were removed, communications opened; and finally, by a series\r\nof treaties with the neighbouring German States, the foundations were laid\r\nfor that Customs-Union which, under the name of the Zollverein, ultimately\r\nembraced almost the whole of non-Austrian Germany. As one Principality\r\nafter another attached itself to the Prussian system, the products of the\r\nvarious regions of Germany, hitherto blocked by the frontier dues of each\r\npetty State, moved freely through the land, while the costs attending the\r\ntaxation of foreign imports, now concentrated upon the external line of\r\nfrontier, were enormously diminished. Patient, sagacious, and even liberal\r\nin its negotiations with its weaker neighbours, Prussia silently connected\r\nwith itself through the ties of financial union States which had hitherto\r\nlooked to Austria as their natural head. The semblance of political union\r\nwas carefully avoided, but the germs of political union were nevertheless\r\npresent in the growing community of material interests. The reputation of\r\nthe Prussian Government, no less than the welfare of the Prussian people,\r\nwas advanced by each successive step in the extension of the Zollverein;\r\nand although the earlier stages alone had been passed in the years before\r\n1830, enough had already been done to affect public opinion; and the\r\ngeneral sense of material progress combined with other influences to close\r\nPrussia to the revolutionary tendencies of that year.\r\n\r\n[Insurrections in Brunswick and Cassel.]\r\n\r\n[Constitutions in Hanover and Saxony, 1830-1833.]\r\n\r\nThere were, however, other States in northern Germany which had all the\r\ndefects of Prussian autocracy without any of its redeeming qualities. In\r\nBrunswick and in Hesse Cassel despotism existed in its most contemptible\r\nform; the violence of a half-crazy youth in the one case, and the caprices\r\nof an obstinate dotard in the other, rendering authority a mere nuisance to\r\nthose who were subject to it. Here accordingly revolution broke out. The\r\nthreatened princes had made themselves too generally obnoxious or\r\nridiculous for any hand to be raised in their defence. Their disappearance\r\nexcited no more than the inevitable lament from Metternich; and in both\r\nStates systems of representative government were introduced by their\r\nsuccessors. In Hanover and in Saxony agitation also began in favour of\r\nParliamentary rule. The disturbance that arose was not of a serious\r\ncharacter, and it was met by the Courts in a conciliatory spirit.\r\nConstitutions were granted, the liberty of the Press extended, and trial by\r\njury established. On the whole, the movement of 1830, as it affected\r\nnorthern Germany, was rationally directed and salutary in its results.\r\nChanges of real value were accomplished with a sparing employment of\r\nrevolutionary means, and, in the more important cases, through the friendly\r\nco-operation of the sovereigns with their subjects. It was not the fault of\r\nthose who had asked for the same degree of liberty in northern Germany\r\nwhich the south already possessed, that Germany at large again experienced\r\nthe miseries of reaction and repression which had afflicted it ten years\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n[Movement in the Palatinate.]\r\n\r\nLike Belgium and the Rhenish Provinces, the Bavarian Palatinate had for\r\ntwenty years been incorporated with France. Its inhabitants had grown\r\naccustomed to the French law and French institutions, and had caught\r\nsomething of the political animation which returned to France after\r\nNapoleon's fall. Accordingly when the government of Munich, alarmed by the\r\nJuly Revolution, showed an inclination towards repressive measures, the\r\nPalatinate, severed from the rest of the Bavarian monarchy and in immediate\r\ncontact with France, became the focus of a revolutionary agitation. The\r\nPress had already attained some activity and some influence in this\r\nprovince; and although the leaders of the party of progress were still to a\r\ngreat extent Professors, they had so far advanced upon the patriots of 1818\r\nas to understand that the liberation of the German people was not to be\r\neffected by the lecturers and the scholars of the Universities. The design\r\nhad been formed of enlisting all classes of the public on the side of\r\nreform, both by the dissemination of political literature and by the\r\nestablishment of societies not limited, as in 1818, to academic circles,\r\nbut embracing traders as well as soldiers and professional men. Even the\r\npeasant was to be reached and instructed in his interests as a citizen. It\r\nwas thought that much might be effected by associating together all the\r\nOppositions in the numerous German Parliaments; but a more striking feature\r\nof the revolutionary movement which began in the Palatinate, and one\r\nstrongly distinguishing it from the earlier agitation of Jena and Erfurt,\r\nwas its cosmopolitan character. France in its triumph and Poland in its\r\ndeath-struggle excited equal interest and sympathy. In each the cause of\r\nEuropean liberty appeared to be at stake. The Polish banner was saluted in\r\nthe Palatinate by the side of that of united Germany; and from that time\r\nforward in almost every revolutionary movement of Europe, down to the\r\ninsurrection of the Commune of Paris in 1871, Polish exiles have been\r\nactive both in the organisation of revolt and in the field.\r\n\r\n[Reaction in Germany.]\r\n\r\nUntil the fall of Warsaw, in September, 1831, the German governments,\r\nuncertain of the course which events might take in Europe, had shown a\r\ncertain willingness to meet the complaints of their subjects, and had in\r\nespecial relaxed the supervision exercised over the press. The fall of\r\nWarsaw, which quieted so many alarms, and made the Emperor Nicholas once\r\nmore a power outside his own dominions, inaugurated a period of reaction in\r\nGermany. The Diet began the campaign against democracy by suppressing\r\nvarious liberal newspapers, and amongst them the principal journal of the\r\nPalatinate. It was against this movement of regression that the agitation\r\nin the Palatinate and elsewhere was now directed. A festival, or\r\ndemonstration, was held at the Castle of Hambach, near Zweibrücken, at\r\nwhich a body of enthusiasts called upon the German people to unite against\r\ntheir oppressors, and some even urged an immediate appeal to arms (May 27,\r\n1832). Similar meetings, though on a smaller scale, were held in other\r\nparts of Germany. Wild words abounded, and the connection of the German\r\nrevolutionists with that body of opponents of all established governments\r\nwhich had its council-chamber at Paris and its head in Lafayette was openly\r\navowed. Weak and insignificant as the German demagogues were, their\r\nextravagance gave to Metternich and to the Diet sufficient pretext for\r\nrevising the reactionary measures of 1819. Once more the subordination of\r\nall representative bodies to the sovereign's authority was laid down by the\r\nDiet as a binding principle for every German state. The refusal of taxes by\r\nany legislature was declared to be an act of rebellion which would be met\r\nby the armed intervention of the central Powers. All political meetings and\r\nassociations were forbidden; the Press was silenced; the introduction of\r\nGerman books printed abroad was prohibited, and the Universities were again\r\nplaced under the watch of the police (July, 1832). [394]\r\n\r\n[Attempt at Frankfort, April, 1833.]\r\n\r\nIf among the minor sovereigns of Germany there were some who, as in Baden,\r\nsincerely desired the development of free institutions, the authority\r\nexercised by Metternich and his adherents in reaction bore down all the\r\nresistance that these courts could offer, and the hand of despotism fell\r\neverywhere heavily upon the party of political progress. The majority of\r\nGerman Liberals, not yet prepared for recourse to revolutionary measures,\r\nsubmitted to the pressure of the times, and disclaimed all sympathy with\r\nillegal acts; a minority, recognising that nothing was now to be gained by\r\nconstitutional means, entered into conspiracies, and determined to liberate\r\nGermany by force. One insignificant group, relying upon the armed\r\nco-operation of Polish bands in France, and deceived by promises of support\r\nfrom some Würtemberg soldiers, actually rose in insurrection at Frankfort.\r\nA guard-house was seized, and a few soldiers captured; but the citizens of\r\nFrankfort stood aloof, and order was soon restored (April, 1833). It was\r\nnot to be expected that the reactionary courts should fail to draw full\r\nadvantage from this ill-timed outbreak of their enemies. Prussian troops\r\nmarched into Frankfort, and Metternich had no difficulty in carrying\r\nthrough the Diet a decree establishing a commission to superintend and to\r\nreport upon the proceedings instituted against political offenders\r\nthroughout Germany. For several years these investigations continued, and\r\nthe campaign against the opponents of government was carried on with\r\nvarious degrees of rigour in the different states. About two thousand\r\npersons altogether were brought to trial: in Prussia thirty-nine sentences\r\nof death were pronounced, but not executed. In the struggle against\r\nrevolution the forces of monarchy had definitely won the victory. Germany\r\nagain experienced, as it had in 1819, that the federal institutions which\r\nwere to have given it unity existed only for the purposes of repression.\r\nThe breach between the nation and its rulers, in spite of the apparent\r\nfailure of the democratic party, remained far deeper and wider than it had\r\nbeen before; and although Metternich, victor once more over the growing\r\nrestlessness of the age, slumbered on for another decade in fancied\r\nsecurity, the last of his triumphs had now been won, and the next uprising\r\nproved how blind was that boasted statesmanship which deemed the sources of\r\ndanger exhausted when once its symptoms had been driven beneath the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n[Conspirators and exiles.]\r\n\r\n[Dispersion of the Swiss exiles, 1834.]\r\n\r\nIn half the states of Europe there were now bodies of exasperated,\r\nuncompromising men, who devoted their lives to plotting against\r\ngovernments, and who formed, in their community of interest and purpose, a\r\nsort of obverse of the Holy Alliance, a federation of kings' enemies, a\r\nleague of principle and creed, in which liberty and human right stood\r\ntowards established rule as light to darkness. As the grasp of authority\r\nclosed everywhere more tightly upon its baffled foes, more and more of\r\nthese men passed into exile. Among them was the Genoese Mazzini, who, after\r\nsuffering imprisonment in 1831, withdrew to Marseilles, and there, in\r\ncombination with various secret societies, planned an incursion into the\r\nItalian province of Savoy. It was at first intended that this enterprise\r\nshould be executed simultaneously with the German rising at Frankfort.\r\nDelays, however, arose, and it was not until the beginning of the following\r\nyear that the little army, which numbered more Poles than Italians, was\r\nready for its task. The incursion was made from Geneva in February, 1834,\r\nand ended disastrously. [395] Mazzini returned to Switzerland, where\r\nhundreds of exiles, secure under the shelter of the Republic, devised\r\nschemes of attack upon the despots of Europe, and even rioted in honour of\r\nfreedom in the streets of the Swiss cities which protected them. The effect\r\nof the revolutionary movement of the time in consolidating the alliance of\r\nthe three Eastern Powers, so rudely broken by the Greek War of Liberation,\r\nnow came clearly into view. The sovereigns of Russia and Austria had met at\r\nMünchengrätz in Bohemia in the previous autumn, and, in concert with\r\nPrussia, had resolved upon common principles of action if their\r\nintervention should be required against disturbers of order. Notes were now\r\naddressed from every quarter to the Swiss Government, requiring the\r\nexpulsion of all persons concerned in enterprises against the peace of\r\nneighbouring States. Some resistance to this demand was made by individual\r\ncantons; but the extravagance of many of the refugees themselves alienated\r\npopular sympathy, and the greater part of them were forced to quit\r\nSwitzerland and to seek shelter in England or in America. With the\r\ndispersion of the central band of exiles the open alliance which had\r\nexisted between the revolutionists of Europe gradually passed away. The\r\nbrotherhood of the kings had proved a stern reality, the brotherhood of the\r\npeoples a delusive vision. Mazzini indeed, who up to this time had scarcely\r\nemerged from the rabble of revolutionary leaders, was yet to prove how\r\ndeeply the genius, the elevation, the fervour of one man struggling against\r\nthe powers of the world may influence the history of his age; but the fire\r\nthat purified the fine gold charred and consumed the baser elements; and of\r\nthose who had hoped the most after 1830, many now sank into despair, or\r\ngave up their lives to mere restless agitation and intrigue.\r\n\r\n[Difficulties of Louis Philippe.]\r\n\r\n[Insurrections, 1832-1834.]\r\n\r\n[Repressive Laws, Sept., 1835.]\r\n\r\nIt was in France that the revolutionary movement was longest maintained.\r\nDuring the first year of Louis Philippe's rule the opposition to his\r\ngovernment was inspired not so much by Republicanism as by a wild and\r\ninconsiderate sympathy with the peoples who were fighting for liberty\r\nelsewhere, and by a headstrong impulse to take up arms on their behalf. The\r\nfamous decree of the Convention in 1792, which promised the assistance of\r\nFrance to every nation in revolt against its rulers, was in fact the true\r\nexpression of what was felt by a great part of the French nation in 1831;\r\nand in the eyes of these enthusiasts it was the unpardonable offence of\r\nLouis Philippe against the honour of France that he allowed Poland and\r\nItaly to succumb without drawing his sword against their conquerors. That\r\nFrance would have had to fight the three Eastern Powers combined, if it had\r\nallied itself with those in revolt against any one of the three, passed for\r\nnothing among the clamorous minority in the Chamber and among the orators\r\nof Paris. The pacific policy of Casimir Perier was misunderstood; it passed\r\nfor mere poltroonery, when in fact it was the only policy that could save\r\nFrance from a recurrence of the calamities of 1815. There were other causes\r\nfor the growing unpopularity of the King and of his Ministers, but the\r\nfirst was their policy of peace. As the attacks of his opponents became\r\nmore and more bitter, the government of Casimir Perier took more and more\r\nof a repressive character. Disappointment at the small results produced in\r\nFrance itself by the Revolution of July worked powerfully in men's minds.\r\nThe forces that had been set in motion against Charles X. were not to be\r\nlaid at rest at the bidding of those who had profited by them, and a\r\nRepublican party gradually took definite shape and organisation. Tumult\r\nsucceeded tumult. In the summer of 1832 the funeral of General Lamarque, a\r\npopular soldier, gave the signal for insurrection at Paris. There was\r\nsevere fighting in the streets; the National Guard, however, proved true to\r\nthe king, and shared with the army in the honours of its victory.\r\nRepressive measures and an unbroken series of prosecutions against\r\nseditious writers followed this first armed attack upon the established\r\ngovernment. The bitterness of the Opposition, the discontent of the working\r\nclasses, far surpassed anything that had been known under Charles X. The\r\nwhole country was agitated by revolutionary societies and revolutionary\r\npropaganda. Disputes between masters and workmen, which, in consequence of\r\nthe growth of French manufacturing industry, now became both frequent and\r\nimportant, began to take a political colour. Polish and Italian exiles\r\nconnected their own designs with attacks to be made upon the French\r\nGovernment from within; and at length, in April, 1834, after the passing of\r\na law against trades-unions, the working classes of Lyons, who were on\r\nstrike against their employers, were induced to rise in revolt. After\r\nseveral days' fighting the insurrection was suppressed. Simultaneous\r\noutbreaks took place at St. Etienne, Grenoble, and many other places in the\r\nsouth and centre of France; and on a report of the success of the\r\ninsurgents reaching Paris, the Republic was proclaimed and barricades were\r\nerected. Again civil war raged in the streets, and again the forces of\r\nGovernment gained the victory. A year more passed, during which the\r\ninvestigations into the late revolt and the trial of a host of prisoners\r\nserved rather to agitate than to reassure the public mind; and in the\r\nsummer of 1835 an attempt was made upon the life of the King so terrible\r\nand destructive in its effects as to amount to a public calamity. An\r\ninfernal machine composed of a hundred gun-barrels was fired by a Corsican\r\nnamed Fieschi, as the King with a large suite was riding through the\r\nstreets of Paris on the anniversary of the Revolution of July. Fourteen\r\npersons were killed on the spot, among whom was Mortier, one of the oldest\r\nof the marshals of France; many others were fatally or severely injured.\r\nThe King, however, with his three sons, escaped unhurt, and the repressive\r\nlaws that followed this outrage marked the close of open revolutionary\r\nagitation in France. Whether in consequence of the stringency of the new\r\nlaws, or of the exhaustion of a party discredited in public estimation by\r\nthe crimes of a few of its members and the recklessness of many more, the\r\nconstitutional monarchy of Louis Philippe now seemed to have finally\r\nvanquished its opponents. Repeated attempts were made on the life of the\r\nKing, but they possessed for the most part little political significance.\r\nOrder was welcome to the nation at large; and though in the growth of a\r\nsocialistic theory and creed of life which dates from this epoch there lay\r\na danger to Governments greater than any purely political, Socialism was as\r\nyet the affair of thinkers rather than of active workers either in the\r\nindustrial or in the Parliamentary world. The Government had beaten its\r\nenemies outside the Chamber. Within the Chamber, the parties of extremes\r\nceased to exercise any real influence. Groups were formed, and rival\r\nleaders played against one another for office; but they were separated by\r\nno far-reaching differences of aim, and by no real antagonism of\r\nconstitutional principle. During the succeeding years of Louis Philippe's\r\nreign there was little visible on the surface but the normal rivalry of\r\nparties under a constitutional monarchy. The middle-class retained its\r\nmonopoly of power: authority, centralised as before, maintained its old\r\nprestige in France, and softened opposition by judicious gifts of office\r\nand emolument. Revolutionary passion seemed to have died away: and the\r\ntriumphs or reverses of party-leaders in the Chamber of Deputies succeeded\r\nto the harassing and doubtful conflict between Government and insurrection.\r\n\r\n[The English Reform movement.]\r\n\r\nThe near coincidence in time between the French Revolution of 1830 and the\r\npassing of the English Reform Bill is apt to suggest to those who look for\r\nthe operation of wide general causes in history that the English Reform\r\nmovement should be viewed as a part of the great current of political\r\nchange which then traversed the continent of Europe. But on a closer\r\nexamination this view is scarcely borne out by facts, and the coincidence\r\nof the two epochs of change appears to be little more than accidental. The\r\ngeneral unity that runs through the history of the more advanced\r\ncontinental states is indeed stronger than appears to a superficial reader\r\nof history; but this correspondence of tendency does not always embrace\r\nEngland; on the contrary, the conditions peculiar to England usually\r\npreponderate over those common to England and other countries, exhibiting\r\nat times more of contrast than of similarity, as in the case of the\r\nNapoleonic epoch, when the causes which drew together the western half of\r\nthe continent operated powerfully to exclude our own country from the\r\ncurrent influences of the time, and made the England of 1815, in opinion,\r\nin religion, and in taste much more insular than the England of 1780. The\r\nrevolution which overthrew Charles X. did no doubt encourage and stimulate\r\nthe party of Reform in Great Britain; but, unlike the Belgian, the German,\r\nand the Italian movements, the English Reform movement would unquestionably\r\nhave run the same course and achieved the same results even if the revolt\r\nagainst the ordinances of Charles X. had been successfully repressed, and\r\nthe Bourbon monarchy had maintained itself in increased strength and\r\nreputation. A Reform of Parliament had been acknowledged to be necessary\r\nforty years before. Pitt had actually proposed it in 1785, and but for the\r\noutbreak of the French Revolution would probably have carried it into\r\neffect before the close of the last century. The development of English\r\nmanufacturing industry which took place between 1790 and 1830, accompanied\r\nby the rapid growth of towns and the enrichment of the urban middle class,\r\nrendered the design of Pitt, which would have transferred the\r\nrepresentation of the decayed boroughs to the counties alone, obsolete, and\r\nmade the claims of the new centres of population too strong to be resisted.\r\nIn theory the representative system of the country was completely\r\ntransformed; but never was a measure which seemed to open the way to such\r\nboundless possibilities of change so thoroughly safe and so thoroughly\r\nconservative. In spite of the increased influence won by the wealthy part\r\nof the commercial classes, the House of Commons continued to be drawn\r\nmainly from the territorial aristocracy. Cabinet after Cabinet was formed\r\nwith scarcely a single member included in it who was not himself a man of\r\ntitle, or closely connected with the nobility: the social influence of rank\r\nwas not diminished; and although such measures as the Reform of Municipal\r\nCorporations attested the increased energy of the Legislature, no party in\r\nthe House of Commons was weaker than that which supported the democratic\r\ndemands for the Ballot and for Triennial Parliaments, nor was the repeal of\r\nthe Corn Laws seriously considered until famine had made it inevitable.\r\nThat the widespread misery which existed in England after 1832, as the\r\nresult of the excessive increase of our population and the failure alike of\r\nlaw and of philanthropy to keep pace with the exigencies of a vast\r\nindustrial growth, should have been so quietly borne, proves how great was\r\nthe success of the Reform Bill as a measure of conciliation between\r\nGovernment and people. But the crowning justification of the changes made\r\nin 1832, and the complete and final answer to those who had opposed them as\r\nrevolutionary, was not afforded until 1848, when, in the midst of European\r\nconvulsion, the monarchy and the constitution of England remained unshaken.\r\nBold as the legislation of Lord Grey appeared to men who had been brought\r\nup amidst the reactionary influences dominant in England since 1793, the\r\nReform Bill belongs not to the class of great creative measures which have\r\ninaugurated new periods in the life of nations, but to the class of those\r\nwhich, while least affecting the general order of society, have most\r\ncontributed to political stability and to the avoidance of revolutionary\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrance and England after 1830--Affairs of Portugal--Don Miguel--Don Pedro\r\ninvades Portugal--Ferdinand of Spain--The Pragmatic Sanction--Death of\r\nFerdinand: Regency of Christina--The Constitution--Quadruple Alliance--\r\nMiguel and Carlos expelled from Portugal--Carlos enters Spain--The Basque\r\nProvinces--Carlist War: Zumalacarregui--The Spanish Government seeks French\r\nassistance, which is refused--Constitution of 1837--End of the War--Regency\r\nof Espartero--Isabella Queen--Affairs of the Ottoman Empire--Ibrahim\r\ninvades Syria; his victories--Rivalry of France and Russia at\r\nConstantinople--Peace of Kutaya and Treaty of Unkiar Skelessi--Effect of\r\nthis Treaty--France and Mehemet Ali--Commerce of the Levant--Second War\r\nbetween Mehemet and the Porte--Ottoman disasters--The Policy of the Great\r\nPowers--Quadruple Treaty without France--Ibrahim expelled from Syria--Final\r\nSettlement--Turkey after 1840--Attempted reforms of Reschid Pasha.\r\n\r\n\r\n[France and England after 1830.]\r\n\r\nAlliances of opinion usually cover the pursuit on one or both sides of some\r\ndefinite interest; and to this rule the alliance which appeared to be\r\nspringing up between France and England after the changes of 1830 was no\r\nexception. In the popular view, the bond of union between the two States\r\nwas a common attachment to principles of liberty; and on the part of the\r\nWhig statesmen who now governed England this sympathy with free\r\nconstitutional systems abroad was certainly a powerful force: but other\r\nmotives than mere community of sentiment combined to draw the two\r\nGovernments together, and in the case of France these immediate interests\r\ngreatly outweighed any abstract preference for a constitutional ally. Louis\r\nPhilippe had an avowed and obstinate enemy in the Czar of Russia, who had\r\nbeen his predecessor's friend: the Court of Vienna tolerated usurpers only\r\nwhere worse mischief would follow from attacking them; Prussia had no\r\nmotive for abandoning the connexions which it had maintained since 1815. As\r\nthe union between the three Eastern Courts grew closer in consequence of\r\nthe outbreak of revolution beyond the borders of France, a good\r\nunderstanding with Great Britain became more and more obviously the right\r\npolicy for Louis Philippe; on the other hand, the friendship of France\r\nseemed likely to secure England from falling back into that isolated\r\nposition which it had occupied when the Holy Alliance laid down the law to\r\nEurope, and averted the danger to which the Ottoman Empire, as well as the\r\npeace of the world, had been exposed by the combination of French with\r\nRussian schemes of aggrandizement. If Canning, left without an ally in\r\nEurope, had called the new world into existence to redress the balance of\r\nthe old, his Whig successors might well look with some satisfaction on that\r\nshifting of the weights which had brought over one of the Great Powers to\r\nthe side of England, and anticipate, in the concert of the two great\r\nWestern States, the establishment of a permanent force in European politics\r\nwhich should hold in check the reactionary influences of Vienna and St.\r\nPetersburg. To some extent these views were realised. A general relation of\r\nfriendliness was recognised as subsisting between the Governments of Paris\r\nand London, and in certain European complications their intervention was\r\narranged in common. But even here the element of mistrust was seldom\r\nabsent; and while English Ministers jealously watched each action of their\r\nneighbour, the French Government rarely allowed the ties of an informal\r\nalliance to interfere with the prosecution of its own views. Although down\r\nto the close of Louis Philippe's reign the good understanding between\r\nEngland and France was still nominally in existence, all real confidence\r\nhad then long vanished; and on more than one occasion the preservation of\r\npeace between the two nations had been seriously endangered.\r\n\r\n[Affairs of Portugal, 1826-1830.]\r\n\r\nIt was in the establishment of the kingdom of Belgium that the combined\r\naction of France and England produced its first and most successful result.\r\nA second demand was made upon the Governments of the two constitutional\r\nPowers by the conflicts which agitated the Spanish Peninsula, and which\r\nwere stimulated in the general interests of absolutism by both the Austrian\r\nand the Russian Court. The intervention of Canning in 1826 on behalf of the\r\nconstitutional Regency of Portugal against the foreign supporters of Don\r\nMiguel, the head of the clerical and reactionary party, had not permanently\r\nrestored peace to that country. Miguel indeed accepted the constitution,\r\nand, after betrothing himself to the infant sovereign, Donna Maria, who was\r\nstill with her father Pedro, in Brazil, entered upon the Regency which his\r\nelder brother had promised to him. But his actions soon disproved the\r\nprofessions of loyalty to the constitution which he had made; and after\r\ndissolving the Cortes, and re-assembling the mediæval Estates, he caused\r\nhimself to be proclaimed King (June, 1828). A reign of terror followed. The\r\nconstitutionalists were completely crushed. Miguel's own brutal violence\r\ngave an example to all the fanatics and ruffians who surrounded him; and\r\nafter an unsuccessful appeal to arms, those of the adherents of Donna Maria\r\nand the constitution who escaped from imprisonment or execution took refuge\r\nin England or in the Azore islands, where Miguel had not been able to\r\nestablish his authority. Though Miguel was not officially recognised as\r\nSovereign by most of the foreign Courts, his victory was everywhere seen\r\nwith satisfaction by the partisans of absolutism; and in Great Britain,\r\nwhere the Duke of Wellington was still in power, the precedent of Canning's\r\nintervention was condemned, and a strict neutrality maintained. Not only\r\nwas all assistance refused to Donna Maria, but her adherents who had taken\r\nrefuge in England were prevented from making this country the basis of any\r\noperations against the usurper.\r\n\r\n[Invasion of Portugal by Pedro. July, 1832.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation of Portuguese affairs when the events of 1830\r\nbrought an entirely new spirit into the foreign policy of both England and\r\nFrance. Miguel, however, had no inclination to adapt his own policy to the\r\nchange of circumstances; on the contrary, he challenged the hostility of\r\nboth governments by persisting in a series of wanton attacks upon English\r\nand French subjects resident at Lisbon. Satisfaction was demanded, and\r\nexacted by force. English and French squadrons successively appeared in the\r\nTagus. Lord Palmerston, now Foreign Secretary in the Ministry of Earl Grey,\r\nwas content with obtaining a pecuniary indemnity for his countrymen,\r\naccompanied by a public apology from the Portuguese Government: the French\r\nadmiral, finding some difficulty in obtaining redress, carried off the best\r\nships of Don Miguel's navy. [396] A weightier blow was, however, soon to\r\nfall upon the usurper. His brother, the Emperor Pedro, threatened with\r\nrevolution in Brazil, resolved to return to Europe and to enforce the\r\nrights of his daughter to the throne of Portugal. Pedro arrived in London\r\nin July, 1831, and was permitted by the Government to raise troops and to\r\nsecure the services of some of the best naval officers of this country. The\r\ngathering place of his forces was Terceira, one of the Azore islands, and\r\nin the summer of 1832 a sufficiently strong body of troops was collected to\r\nundertake the reconquest of Portugal. A landing was made at Oporto, and\r\nthis city fell into the hands of Don Pedro without resistance. Miguel,\r\nhowever, now marched against his brother, and laid siege to Oporto. For\r\nnearly a year no progress was made by either side; at length the arrival of\r\nvolunteers from various countries, among whom was Captain Charles Napier,\r\nenabled Pedro to divide his forces and to make a new attack on Portugal\r\nfrom the south. Napier, in command of the fleet, annihilated the navy of\r\nDon Miguel off St. Vincent; his colleague, Villa Flor, landed and marched\r\non Lisbon. The resistance of the enemy was overcome, and on the 28th of\r\nJuly, 1833, Don Pedro entered the capital. But the war was not yet at an\r\nend, for Miguel's cause was as closely identified with the interests of\r\nEuropean absolutism as that of his brother was with constitutional right,\r\nand assistance both in troops and money continued to arrive at his camp.\r\nThe struggle threatened to prove a long and obstinate one, when a new turn\r\nwas given to events in the Peninsula by the death of Ferdinand, King of\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\n[Death of Ferdinand, Sept., 1833.]\r\n\r\nSince the restoration of absolute Government in Spain in 1823, Ferdinand,\r\nin spite of his own abject weakness and ignorance, had not given complete\r\nsatisfaction to the fanatics of the clerical party. Some vestiges of\r\nstatesmanship, some sense of political necessity, as well as the influence\r\nof foreign counsellors, had prevented the Government of Madrid from\r\ncompletely identifying itself with the monks and zealots who had first\r\nrisen against the constitution of 1820, and who now sought to establish the\r\nabsolute supremacy of the Church. The Inquisition had not been restored,\r\nand this alone was enough to stamp the King as a renegade in the eyes of\r\nthe ferocious and implacable champions of mediæval bigotry. Under the name\r\nof Apostolicals, these reactionaries had at times broken into open\r\nrebellion. Their impatience had, however, on the whole been restrained by\r\nthe knowledge that in the King's brother and heir, Don Carlos, they had an\r\nadherent whose devotion to the priestly cause was beyond suspicion, and who\r\nmight be expected soon to ascend the throne. Ferdinand had been thrice\r\nmarried; he was childless; his state of health miserable; and his life\r\nlikely to be a short one. The succession to the throne of Spain had\r\nmoreover, since 1713, been governed by the Salic Law, so that even in the\r\nevent of Ferdinand leaving female issue Don Carlos would nevertheless\r\ninherit the crown. These confident hopes were rudely disturbed by the\r\nmarriage of the King with his cousin Maria Christina of Naples, followed by\r\nan edict, known as the Pragmatic Sanction, repealing the Salic Law which\r\nhad been introduced with the first Bourbon, and restoring the ancient\r\nCastilian custom under which women were capable of succeeding to the crown.\r\nA daughter, Isabella, was shortly afterwards born to the new Queen. On the\r\nlegality of the Pragmatic Sanction the opinions of publicists differed; it\r\nwas judged, however, by Europe at large not from the point of view of\r\nantiquarian theory, but with direct reference to its immediate effect. The\r\nthree Eastern Courts emphatically condemned it, as an interference with\r\nestablished monarchical right, and as a blow to the cause of European\r\nabsolutism through the alliance which it would almost certainly produce\r\nbetween the supplanters of Don Carlos and the Liberals of the Spanish\r\nPeninsula. [397] To the clerical and reactionary party at Madrid, it\r\namounted to nothing less than a sentence of destruction, and the utmost\r\npressure was brought to bear upon the weak and dying King with the object\r\nof inducing him to undo the alleged wrong which he had done to his brother.\r\nIn a moment of prostration Ferdinand revoked the Pragmatic Sanction; but,\r\nsubsequently, regaining some degree of strength, he re-enacted it, and\r\nappointed Christina Regent during the continuance of his illness. Don\r\nCarlos, protesting against the violation of his rights, had betaken himself\r\nto Portugal, where he made common cause with Miguel. His adherents had no\r\nintention of submitting to the change of succession. Their resentment was\r\nscarcely restrained during Ferdinand's life-time, and when, in September,\r\n1833, his long-expected death took place, and the child Isabella was\r\ndeclared Queen under the Regency of her mother, open rebellion broke out,\r\nand Carlos was proclaimed King in several of the northern provinces.\r\n\r\n[The Regency and the Carlists.]\r\n\r\n[Quadruple Treaty, April 22, 1834.]\r\n\r\n[Miguel and Carlos removed, May, 1834.]\r\n\r\nFor the moment the forces of the Regency seemed to be far superior to those\r\nof the insurgents, and Don Carlos failed to take advantage of the first\r\noutburst of enthusiasm and to place himself at the head of his followers.\r\nHe remained in Portugal, while Christina, as had been expected, drew nearer\r\nto the Spanish Liberals, and ultimately called to power a Liberal minister,\r\nMartinez de la Rosa, under whom a constitution was given to Spain by Royal\r\nStatute (April 10, 1834). At the same time negotiations were opened with\r\nPortugal and with the Western Powers, in the hope of forming an alliance\r\nwhich should drive both Miguel and Carlos from the Peninsula. On the 22nd\r\nof April, 1834, a Quadruple Treaty was signed at London, in which the\r\nSpanish Government undertook to send an army into Portugal against Miguel,\r\nthe Court of Lisbon pledging itself in return to use all the means in its\r\npower to expel Don Carlos from Portuguese territory. England engaged to\r\nco-operate by means of its fleet. The assistance of France, if it should be\r\ndeemed necessary for the attainment of the objects of the Treaty, was to be\r\nrendered in such manner as should be settled by common consent. In\r\npursuance of the policy of the Treaty, and even before the formal\r\nengagement was signed, a Spanish division under General Rodil crossed the\r\nfrontier and marched against Miguel. The forces of the usurper were\r\ndefeated. The appearance of the English fleet and the publication of the\r\nTreaty of Quadruple Alliance rendered further resistance hopeless, and on\r\nthe 22nd of May Miguel made his submission, and in return for a large\r\npension renounced all rights to the crown, and undertook to quit the\r\nPeninsula for ever. Don Carlos, refusing similar conditions, went on board\r\nan English ship, and was conducted to London. [398]\r\n\r\n[Carlos appears in Spain.]\r\n\r\nWith respect to Portugal, the Quadruple Alliance had completely attained\r\nits object; and in so far as the Carlist cause was strengthened by the\r\ncontinuance of civil war in the neighbouring country, this source of\r\nstrength was no doubt withdrawn from it. But in its effect upon Don Carlos\r\nhimself the action of the Quadruple Alliance was worse than useless. While\r\nfulfilling the letter of the Treaty, which stipulated for the expulsion of\r\nthe two pretenders from the Peninsula, the English Admiral had removed\r\nCarlos from Portugal, where he was comparatively harmless, and had taken no\r\neffective guarantee that he should not re-appear in Spain itself and\r\nenforce his claim by arms. Carlos had not been made a prisoner of war; he\r\nhad made no promises and incurred no obligations; nor could the British\r\nGovernment, after his arrival in this country, keep him in perpetual\r\nrestraint. Quitting England after a short residence, he travelled in\r\ndisguise through France, crossed the Pyrenees, and appeared on the 10th of\r\nJuly, 1834, at the headquarters of the Carlist insurgents in Navarre.\r\n\r\n[The Basque Provinces.]\r\n\r\nIn the country immediately below the western Pyrenees, the so-called Basque\r\nProvinces, lay the chief strength of the Carlist rebellion. These\r\nprovinces, which were among the most thriving and industrious parts of\r\nSpain, might seem by their very superiority an unlikely home for a movement\r\nwhich was directed against everything favourable to liberty, tolerance, and\r\nprogress in the Spanish kingdom. But the identification of the Basques with\r\nthe Carlist cause was due in fact to local, not to general, causes; and in\r\nfighting to impose a bigoted despot upon the Spanish people, they were in\r\ntruth fighting to protect themselves from a closer incorporation with\r\nSpain. Down to the year 1812, the Basque provinces had preserved more than\r\nhalf of the essentials of independence. Owing to their position on the\r\nFrench frontier, the Spanish monarchy, while destroying all local\r\nindependence in the interior of Spain, had uniformly treated the Basques\r\nwith the same indulgence which the Government of Great Britain has shown to\r\nthe Channel Islands, and which the French monarchy, though in a less\r\ndegree, showed to the frontier province of Alsace in the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries. The customs-frontier of the north of Spain was drawn\r\nto the south of these districts. The inhabitants imported what they pleased\r\nfrom France without paying any duties; while the heavy import-dues levied\r\nat the border of the neighbouring Spanish provinces gave them the\r\nopportunity of carrying on an easy and lucrative system of smuggling. The\r\nlocal administration remained to a great extent in the hands of the people\r\nthemselves; each village preserved its active corporate life; and the\r\neffect of this survival of a vigorous local freedom was seen in the\r\nremarkable contrast described by travellers between the aspect of the\r\nBasque districts and that of Spain at large. The Fueros, or local rights,\r\nas the Basques considered them, were in reality, when viewed as part of the\r\norder of the Spanish State, a series of exceptional privileges; and it was\r\ninevitable that the framers of the Constitution of 1812, in their attempt\r\nto create a modern administrative and political system doing justice to the\r\nwhole of the nation, should sweep away the distinctions which had hitherto\r\nmarked off one group of provinces from the rest of the community. The\r\ncontinuance of war until the return of Ferdinand, and the overthrow of the\r\nConstitution, prevented the plans of the Cortes from being at that time\r\ncarried into effect; but the revolution of 1820 brought them into actual\r\noperation, and the Basques found themselves, as a result of the victory of\r\nLiberal principles, compelled to pay duties on their imports, robbed of the\r\nprofits of their smuggling, and supplanted in the management of their local\r\naffairs by an army of officials from Madrid. They had gained by the\r\nConstitution little that they had not possessed before, and their losses\r\nwere immediate, tangible, and substantial. The result was, that although\r\nthe larger towns, like Bilbao, remained true to modern ideas, the country\r\ndistricts, led chiefly by priests, took up arms on behalf of the absolute\r\nmonarchy, assisted the French in the restoration of despotism in 1823, and\r\nremained the permanent enemies of the constitutional cause. [399] On the\r\ndeath of Ferdinand they declared at once for Don Carlos, and rose in\r\nrebellion against the Government of Queen Christina, by which they\r\nconsidered the privileges of the Basque Provinces and the interests of\r\nCatholic orthodoxy to be alike threatened.\r\n\r\n[Carlist victories, 1834-5.]\r\n\r\nThere was little in the character of Don Carlos to stimulate the loyalty\r\neven of his most benighted partizans. Of military and political capacity he\r\nwas totally destitute, and his continued absence in Portugal when the\r\nconflict had actually begun proved him to be wanting in the natural\r\nimpulses of a brave man. It was, however, his fortune to be served by a\r\nsoldier of extraordinary energy and skill; and the first reverses of the\r\nCarlists were speedily repaired, and a system of warfare organised which\r\nmade an end of the hopes of easy conquest with which the Government of\r\nChristina had met the insurrection. Fighting in a worthless cause, and\r\ncommanding resources scarcely superior to those of a brigand chief, the\r\nCarlist leader, Zumalacarregui, inflicted defeat after defeat upon the\r\ngenerals who were sent to destroy him. The mountainous character of the\r\ncountry and the universal hostility of the inhabitants made the exertions\r\nof a regular soldiery useless against the alternate flights and surprises\r\nof men who knew every mountain track, and who gained information of the\r\nenemy's movements from every cottager. Terror was added by Zumalacarregui\r\nto all his other methods for demoralising his adversary. In the exercise of\r\nreprisals he repeatedly murdered all his prisoners in cold blood, and gave\r\nto the war so savage a character that foreign Governments at last felt\r\ncompelled to urge upon the belligerents some regard for the usages of the\r\ncivilised world. The appearance of Don Carlos himself in the summer of 1834\r\nraised still higher the confidence already inspired by the victories of his\r\ngeneral. It was in vain that the old constitutionalist soldier, Mina, who\r\nhad won so great a name in these provinces in 1823, returned after long\r\nexile to the scene of his exploits. Enfeebled and suffering, he was no\r\nlonger able to place himself at the head of his troops, and he soon sought\r\nto be relieved from a hopeless task. His successor, the War Minister\r\nValdes, took the field announcing his determination to act upon a new\r\nsystem, and to operate with his troops in mass instead of pursuing the\r\nenemy's bands with detachments. The result of this change of tactics was a\r\ndefeat more ruinous and complete than had befallen any of Valdes'\r\npredecessors. He with difficulty withdrew the remainder of his army from\r\nthe insurgent provinces; and the Carlist leader master of the open country\r\nup to the borders of Castile, prepared to cross the Ebro and to march upon\r\nMadrid. [400]\r\n\r\n[Request to France for assistance, May, 1835.]\r\n\r\nThe Ministers of Queen Christina, who had up till this time professed\r\nthemselves confident in their power to deal with the insurrection, could\r\nnow no longer conceal the real state of affairs. Valdes himself declared\r\nthat the rebellion could not be subdued without foreign aid; and after\r\nprolonged discussion in the Cabinet it was determined to appeal to France\r\nfor armed assistance. The flight of Don Carlos from England had already\r\ncaused an additional article to be added to the Treaty of the Quadruple\r\nAlliance, in which France undertook so to watch the frontier of the\r\nPyrenees that no reinforcements or munition of war should reach the\r\nCarlists from that side, while England promised to supply the troops of\r\nQueen Christina with arms and stores, and, if necessary, to render\r\nassistance with a naval force (18th August, 1834). The foreign supplies\r\nsent to the Carlists had thus been cut off both by land and sea; but more\r\nactive assistance seemed indispensable if Madrid was to be saved from\r\nfalling into the enemy's hands. The request was made to Louis Philippe's\r\nGovernment to occupy the Basque Provinces with a corps of twelve thousand\r\nmen. Reasons of weight might be addressed to the French Court in favour of\r\ndirect intervention. The victory of Don Carlos would place upon the throne\r\nof Spain a representative of all those reactionary influences throughout\r\nEurope which were in secret or in open hostility to the House of Orleans,\r\nand definitely mark the failure of that policy which had led France to\r\ncombine with England in expelling Don Miguel from Portugal. On the other\r\nhand, the experience gained from earlier military enterprises in Spain\r\nmight well deter even bolder politicians than those about Louis Philippe\r\nfrom venturing upon a task whose ultimate issues no man could confidently\r\nforecast. Napoleon had wrecked his empire in the struggle beyond the\r\nPyrenees not less than in the march to Moscow: and the expedition of 1823,\r\nthough free from military difficulties, had exposed France to the\r\nhumiliating responsibility for every brutal act of a despotism which, in\r\nthe very moment of its restoration, had scorned the advice of its\r\nrestorers. The constitutional Government which invoked French assistance\r\nmight, moreover, at any moment give place to a democratic faction which\r\nalready harassed it within the Cortes, and which, in its alliance with the\r\npopulace in many of the great cities, threatened to throw Spain into\r\nanarchy, or to restore the ill-omened constitution of 1812. But above all,\r\nthe attitude of the three Eastern Powers bade the ruler of France hesitate\r\nbefore committing himself to a military occupation of Spanish territory.\r\nTheir sympathies were with Don Carlos, and the active participation of\r\nFrance in the quarrel might possibly call their opposing forces into the\r\nfield and provoke a general war. In view of the evident dangers arising out\r\nof the proposed intervention, the French Government, taking its stand on\r\nthat clause of the Quadruple Treaty which provided that the assistance of\r\nFrance should be rendered in such manner as might be agreed upon by all the\r\nparties to the Treaty, addressed itself to Great Britain, inquiring whether\r\nthis country would undertake a joint responsibility in the enterprise and\r\nshare with France the consequences to which it might give birth. Lord\r\nPalmerston in reply declined to give the assurance required. He stated that\r\nno objection would be raised by the British Government to the entry of\r\nFrench troops into Spain, but that such intervention must be regarded as\r\nthe work of France alone, and be undertaken by France at its own peril.\r\nThis answer sufficed for Louis Philippe and his Ministers. The Spanish\r\nGovernment was informed that the grant of military assistance was\r\nimpossible, and that the entire public opinion of France would condemn so\r\ndangerous an undertaking. As a proof of goodwill, permission was given to\r\nQueen Christina to enrol volunteers both in England and France. Arms were\r\nsupplied; and some thousands of needy or adventurous men ultimately made\r\ntheir way from our own country as well as from France, to earn under\r\nColonel De Lacy Evans and other leaders a scanty harvest of profit or\r\nrenown.\r\n\r\n[Continuance of the war.]\r\n\r\nThe first result of the rejection of the Spanish demand for the direct\r\nintervention of France was the downfall of the Minister by whom this demand\r\nhad been made. His successor, Toreno, though a well-known patriot, proved\r\nunable to stem the tide of revolution that was breaking over the country.\r\nCity after city set up its own Junta, and acted as if the central\r\ngovernment had ceased to exist. Again the appeal for help was made to Louis\r\nPhilippe, and now, not so much to avert the victory of Don Carlos as to\r\nsave Spain from anarchy and from the constitution of 1812. Before an answer\r\ncould arrive, Toreno in his turn had passed away. Mendizabal, a banker who\r\nhad been entrusted with financial business at London, and who had entered\r\ninto friendly relations with Lord Palmerston, was called to office, as a\r\npolitician acceptable to the democratic party, and the advocate of a close\r\nconnection with England rather than with France. In spite of the confident\r\nprofessions of the Minister, and in spite of some assistance actually\r\nrendered by the English fleet, no real progress was made in subduing the\r\nCarlists, or in restoring administrative and financial order. The death of\r\nZumalacarregui, who was forced by Don Carlos to turn northwards and besiege\r\nBilbao instead of marching upon Madrid immediately after his victories, had\r\nchecked the progress of the rebellion at a critical moment; but the\r\nGovernment, distracted and bankrupt, could not use the opportunity which\r\nthus offered itself, and the war soon blazed out anew not only in the\r\nBasque Provinces but throughout the north of Spain. For year after year the\r\nmonotonous struggle continued, while Cortes succeeded Cortes and faction\r\nsupplanted faction, until there remained scarcely an officer who had not\r\nlost his reputation or a politician who was not useless and discredited.\r\n\r\n[Constitution of 1837.]\r\n\r\n[End of the war, Sept., 1839.]\r\n\r\nThe Queen Regent, who from the necessities of her situation had for awhile\r\nbeen the representative of the popular cause, gradually identified herself\r\nwith the interests opposed to democratic change; and although her name was\r\nstill treated with some respect, and her policy was habitually attributed\r\nto the misleading advice of courtiers, her real position was well\r\nunderstood at Madrid, and her own resistance was known to be the principal\r\nobstacle to the restoration of the Constitution of 1812. It was therefore\r\ndetermined to overcome this resistance by force; and on the 13th of August,\r\n1836, a regiment of the garrison of Madrid, won over by the Exaltados,\r\nmarched upon the palace of La Granja, invaded the Queen's apartments, and\r\ncompelled her to sign an edict restoring the Constitution of 1812 until the\r\nCortes should establish that or some other. Scenes of riot and murder\r\nfollowed in the capital. Men of moderate opinions, alarmed at the approach\r\nof anarchy, prepared to unite with Don Carlos. King Louis Philippe, who had\r\njust consented to strengthen the French legion by the addition of some\r\nthousands of trained soldiers, now broke entirely from the Spanish\r\nconnection, and dismissed his Ministers who refused to acquiesce in this\r\nchange of policy. Meanwhile the Eastern Powers and all rational partisans\r\nof absolutism besought Don Carlos to give those assurances which would\r\nsatisfy the wavering mass among his opponents, and place him on the throne\r\nwithout the sacrifice of any right that was worth preserving. It seemed as\r\nif the opportunity was too clear to be misunderstood; but the obstinacy and\r\nnarrowness of Don Carlos were proof against every call of fortune. Refusing\r\nto enter into any sort of engagement, he rendered it impossible for men to\r\nsubmit to him who were not willing to accept absolutism pure and simple. On\r\nthe other hand, a majority of the Cortes, whose eyes were now opened to the\r\ndangers around them, accepted such modifications of the Constitution of\r\n1812 that political stability again appeared possible (June, 1837). The\r\ndanger of a general transference of all moderate elements in the State to\r\nthe side of Don Carlos was averted; and, although the Carlist armies took\r\nup the offensive, menaced the capital, and made incursions into every part\r\nof Spain, the darkest period of the war was now over; and when, after\r\nundertaking in person the march upon Madrid, Don Carlos swerved aside and\r\nultimately fell back in confusion to the Ebro, the suppression of the\r\nrebellion became a certainty. General Espartero, with whom such distinction\r\nremained as was to be gathered in this miserable war, forced back the\r\nadversary step by step, and carried fire and sword into the Basque\r\nProvinces, employing a system of devastation which alone seemed capable of\r\nexhausting the endurance of the people. Reduced to the last extremity, the\r\nCarlist leaders turned their arms against one another. The priests\r\nexcommunicated the generals, and the generals shot the priests; and\r\nfinally, on the 14th September, after the surrender of almost all his\r\ntroops to Espartero, Don Carlos crossed the French frontier, and the\r\nconflict which during six years had barbarised and disgraced the Spanish\r\nnation, reached its close.\r\n\r\n[End of the Regency, Isabella, Queen, Nov., 1843.]\r\n\r\nThe triumph of Queen Christina over her rivals was not of long duration.\r\nConfronted by a strong democratic party both in the Cortes and in the\r\ncountry, she endeavoured in vain to govern by the aid of Ministers of her\r\nown choice. Her popularity had vanished away. The scandals of her private\r\nlife gave just offence to the nation, and fatally weakened her political\r\nauthority. Forced by insurrection to bestow office on Espartero, as the\r\nchief of the Progressist party, she found that the concessions demanded by\r\nthis general were more than she could grant, and in preference to\r\nsubmitting to them she resigned the Regency, and quitted Spain (Oct.,\r\n1840). Espartero, after some interval, was himself appointed Regent by the\r\nCortes. For two years he maintained himself in power, then in his turn he\r\nfell before the combined attack of his political opponents and the extreme\r\nmen of his own party, and passed into exile. There remained in Spain no\r\nsingle person qualified to fill the vacant Regency, and in default of all\r\nother expedients the young princess Isabella, who was now in her fourteenth\r\nyear, was declared of full age, and placed on the throne (Nov., 1843).\r\nChristina returned to Madrid. After some rapid changes of Ministry, a more\r\ndurable Government was formed from the Moderado party under General\r\nNarvaez; and in comparison with the period that had just ended, the first\r\nfew years of the new reign were years of recovery and order.\r\n\r\n[War between Mehemet Ali and the Porte, 1832.]\r\n\r\nThe withdrawal of Louis Philippe from his engagements after the\r\ncapitulation of Maria Christina to the soldiery at La Granja in 1836 had\r\ndiminished the confidence placed in the King by the British Ministry; but\r\nit had not destroyed the relations of friendship existing between the two\r\nGovernments. Far more serious causes of difference arose out of the course\r\nof events in the East, and the extension of the power of Mehemet Ali,\r\nViceroy of Egypt. The struggle between Mehemet and his sovereign, long\r\nforeseen, broke out in the year 1832. After the establishment of the\r\nHellenic Kingdom, the island of Crete had been given to Mehemet in return\r\nfor his services to the Ottoman cause by land and sea. This concession,\r\nhowever, was far from satisfying the ambition of the Viceroy, and a quarrel\r\nwith Abdallah, Pasha of Acre, gave him the opportunity of throwing an army\r\ninto Palestine without directly rebelling against his sovereign (Nov.,\r\n1831). Ibrahim, in command of his father's forces, laid siege to Acre; and\r\nhad this fortress at once fallen, it would probably have been allowed by\r\nthe Sultan to remain in its conqueror's hands as an addition to his own\r\nprovince, since the Turkish army was not ready for war, and it was no\r\nuncommon thing in the Ottoman Empire for one provincial governor to possess\r\nhimself of territory at the expense of another. So obstinate, however, was\r\nthe defence of Acre that time was given to the Porte to make preparations\r\nfor war; and in the spring of 1832, after the issue of a proclamation\r\ndeclaring Mehemet and his son to be rebels, a Turkish army led by Hussein\r\nPasha entered Syria.\r\n\r\n[Ibrahim conquers Syria and Asia Minor.]\r\n\r\nIbrahim, while the siege of Acre was proceeding, had overrun the\r\nsurrounding country. He was now in possession of all the interior of\r\nPalestine, and the tribes of Lebanon had joined him in the expectation of\r\ngaining relief from the burdens of Turkish misgovernment. The fall of Acre,\r\nwhile the relieving army was still near Antioch, enabled him to throw his\r\nfull strength against his opponent in the valley of the Orontes. It was the\r\nintention of the Turkish general, whose forces, though superior in number,\r\nhad not the European training of Ibrahim's regiments, to meet the assault\r\nof the Egyptians in an entrenched camp near Hama. The commander of the\r\nvanguard, however, pushed forward beyond this point, and when far in\r\nadvance of the main body of the army was suddenly attacked by Ibrahim at\r\nHoms. Taken at a moment of complete disorder, the Turks were put to the\r\nrout. Their overthrow and flight so alarmed the general-in-chief that he\r\ndetermined to fall back upon Aleppo, leaving Antioch and all the valley of\r\nthe Orontes to the enemy. Aleppo was reached, but the governor, won over by\r\nIbrahim, closed the gates of the city against the famishing army, and\r\nforced Hussein to continue his retreat to the mountains which form the\r\nbarrier between Syria and Cilicia. Here, at the pass of Beilan, he was\r\nattacked by Ibrahim, outmanoeuvred, and forced to retreat with heavy loss\r\n(July 29). The pursuit was continued through the province of Cilicia.\r\nHussein's army, now completely demoralised, made its escape to the centre\r\nof Asia Minor; the Egyptian, after advancing as far as Mount Taurus and\r\noccupying the passes in this range, took up his quarters in the conquered\r\ncountry in order to refresh his army and to await reinforcements. After two\r\nmonths' halt he renewed his march, crossed Mount Taurus and occupied\r\nKonieh, the capital of this district. Here the last and decisive blow was\r\nstruck. A new Turkish army, led by Reschid Pasha, Ibrahim's colleague in\r\nthe siege of Missolonghi, advanced from the north. Against his own advice,\r\nReschid was compelled by orders from Constantinople to risk everything in\r\nan engagement. He attacked Ibrahim at Konieh on the 21st of December, and\r\nwas completely defeated. Reschid himself was made a prisoner; his army\r\ndispersed; the last forces of the Sultan were exhausted, and the road to\r\nthe Bosphorus lay open before the Egyptian invader.\r\n\r\n[Russian aid offered to the Sultan.]\r\n\r\n[Peace of Kutaya, April, 1833.]\r\n\r\nIn this extremity the Sultan looked around for help; nor were offers of\r\nassistance wanting. The Emperor Nicholas had since the Treaty of Adrianople\r\nassumed the part of the magnanimous friend; his belief was that the Ottoman\r\nEmpire might by judicious management and without further conquest be\r\nbrought into a state of habitual dependence upon Russia; and before the\r\nresult of the battle of Konieh was known General Muravieff had arrived at\r\nConstantinople bringing the offer of Russian help both by land and sea, and\r\ntendering his own personal services in the restoration of peace. Mahmud had\r\nto some extent been won over by the Czar's politic forbearance in the\r\nexecution of the Treaty of Adrianople. His hatred of Mehemet Ali was a\r\nconsuming passion; and in spite of the general conviction both of his\r\npeople and of his advisers that no possible concession to a rebellious\r\nvassal could be so fatal as the protection of the hereditary enemy of\r\nIslam, he was disposed to accept the Russian tender of assistance. As a\r\npreliminary, Muravieff was sent to Alexandria with permission to cede Acre\r\nto Mehemet Ali, if in return the Viceroy would make over his fleet to the\r\nSultan. These were conditions on which no reasonable man could have\r\nexpected that Mehemet would make peace; and the intention of the Russian\r\nCourt probably was that Muravieff's mission should fail. The envoy soon\r\nreturned to Constantinople announcing that his terms were rejected. Mahmud\r\nnow requested that Russian ships might be sent to the Bosphorus, and to the\r\ndismay of the French and English embassies a Russian squadron appeared\r\nbefore the capital. Admiral Roussin, the French ambassador, addressed a\r\nprotest to the Sultan and threatened to leave Constantinople. His\r\nremonstrances induced Mahmud to consent to some more serious negotiation\r\nbeing opened with Mehemet Ali. A French envoy was authorised to promise the\r\nViceroy the governorship of Tripoli in Syria as well as Acre; his\r\novertures, however, were not more acceptable than those of Muravieff, and\r\nMehemet openly declared that if peace were not concluded on his own terms\r\nwithin six weeks, he should order Ibrahim, who had halted at Kutaya, to\r\ncontinue his march on the Bosphorus. Thoroughly alarmed at this threat, and\r\nbelieving that no Turkish force could keep Ibrahim out of the capital,\r\nMahmud applied to Russia for more ships and also for troops. Again Admiral\r\nRoussin urged upon the Sultan that if Syria could be reconquered only by\r\nRussian forces it was more than lost to the Porte. His arguments were\r\nsupported by the Divan, and with such effect that a French diplomatist was\r\nsent to Ibrahim with power to negotiate for peace on any terms.\r\nPreliminaries were signed at Kutaya under French mediation on the 10th of\r\nApril, 1833, by which the Sultan made over to his vassal not only the whole\r\nof Syria but the province of Adana which lies between Mount Taurus and the\r\nMediterranean. After some delay these Preliminaries were ratified by\r\nMahmud; and Ibrahim, after his dazzling success both in war and in\r\ndiplomacy, commenced the evacuation of northern Anatolia.\r\n\r\n[Treaty of Unkiar Skelessi, July, 1833.]\r\n\r\nFor the moment it appeared that French influence had decisively prevailed\r\nat Constantinople, and that the troops of the Czar had been summoned from\r\nSebastopol only to be dismissed with the ironical compliments of those who\r\nwere most anxious to get rid of them. But this was not really the case.\r\nWhether the fluctuations in the Sultan's policy had been due to mere fear\r\nand irresolution, or whether they had to some extent proceeded from the\r\ndesire to play off one Power against another, it was to Russia, not France,\r\nthat his final confidence was given. The soldiers of the Czar were encamped\r\nby the side of the Turks on the eastern shore of the Bosphorus; his ships\r\nlay below Constantinople. Here on the 8th of July a Treaty was signed at\r\nthe palace of Unkiar Skelessi, [401] in which Russia and Turkey entered\r\ninto a defensive alliance of the most intimate character, each Power\r\npledging itself to render assistance to the other, not only against the\r\nattack of an external enemy, but in every event where its peace and\r\nsecurity might be endangered. Russia undertook, in cases where its support\r\nshould be required, to provide whatever amount of troops the Sultan should\r\nconsider necessary both by sea and land, the Porte being charged with no\r\npart of the expense beyond that of the provisioning of the troops. The\r\nduration of the Treaty was fixed in the first instance for eight years. A\r\nsecret article, which, however, was soon afterwards published, declared\r\nthat, in order to diminish the burdens of the Porte, the Czar would not\r\ndemand the material help to which the Treaty entitled him; while, in\r\nsubstitution for such assistance, the Porte undertook, when Russia should\r\nbe at war, to close the Dardanelles to the war-ships of all nations.\r\n\r\n[Effect of this Treaty.]\r\n\r\nBy the Treaty of Unkiar Skelessi, Russia came nearer than it has at any\r\ntime before or since to that complete ascendency at Constantinople which\r\nhas been the modern object of its policy. The success of its diplomatists\r\nhad in fact been too great; for, if the abstract right of the Sultan to\r\nchoose his own allies had not yet been disputed by Europe at large, the\r\nclause in the Treaty which related to the Dardanelles touched the interests\r\nof every Power which possessed a naval station in the Mediterranean. By the\r\npublic law of Europe the Black Sea, which until the eighteenth century was\r\nencompassed entirely by the Sultan's territory, formed no part of the open\r\nwaters of the world, but a Turkish lake to which access was given through\r\nthe Dardanelles only at the pleasure of the Porte. When, in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, Russia gained a footing on the northern shore of the Euxine, this\r\ncarried with it no right to send war-ships through the straits into the\r\nMediterranean, nor had any Power at war with Russia the right to send a\r\nfleet into the Black Sea otherwise than by the Sultan's consent. The Treaty\r\nof Unkiar Skelessi, in making Turkey the ally of Russia against all its\r\nenemies, converted the entrance to the Black Sea into a Russian fortified\r\npost, from behind which Russia could freely send forth its ships of war\r\ninto the Mediterranean, while its own ports and arsenals remained secure\r\nagainst attack. England and France, which were the States whose interests\r\nwere principally affected, protested against the Treaty, and stated they\r\nreserved to themselves the right of taking such action in regard to it as\r\noccasion might demand. Nor did the opposition rest with the protests of\r\ndiplomatists. The attention both of the English nation and of its\r\nGovernment was drawn far more than hitherto to the future of the Ottoman\r\nEmpire. Political writers exposed with unwearied vigour, and not without\r\nexaggeration, the designs of the Court of St. Petersburg in Asia as well as\r\nin Europe; and to this time, rather than to any earlier period, belongs the\r\nfirst growth of that strong national antagonism to Russia which found its\r\nsatisfaction in the Crimean War, and which has by no means lost its power\r\nat the present day.\r\n\r\n[France and Mehemet Ali.]\r\n\r\nIn desiring to check the extension of Russia's influence in the Levant,\r\nGreat Britain and France were at one. The lines of policy, however,\r\nfollowed by these two States were widely divergent. Great Britain sought to\r\nmaintain the Sultan's power in its integrity; France became in an\r\nincreasing degree the patron and the friend of Mehemet Ali. Since the\r\nexpedition of Napoleon to Egypt in 1798, which was itself the execution of\r\na design formed in the reign of Louis XVI., Egypt had largely retained its\r\nhold on the imagination of the leading classes in France. Its monuments,\r\nits relics of a mighty past, touched a livelier chord among French men of\r\nletters and science than India has at any time found among ourselves; and\r\nalthough the hope of national conquest vanished with Napoleon's overthrow,\r\nEgypt continued to afford a field of enterprise to many a civil and\r\nmilitary adventurer. Mehemet's army and navy were organised by French\r\nofficers; he was surrounded by French agents and men of business; and after\r\nthe conquest of Algiers had brought France on to the southern shore of the\r\nMediterranean, the advantages of a close political relation with Egypt did\r\nnot escape the notice of statesmen who saw in Gibraltar and Malta the most\r\nstriking evidences of English maritime power. Moreover the personal fame of\r\nMehemet strongly affected French opinion. His brilliant military reforms,\r\nhis vigorous administration, and his specious achievements in finance\r\ncreated in the minds of those who were too far off to know the effects of\r\nhis tyranny the belief that at the hands of this man the East might yet\r\nawaken to new life. Thus, from a real conviction of the superiority of\r\nMehemet's rule over that of the House of Osman no less than from\r\nconsiderations of purely national policy, the French Government, without\r\nany public or official bond of union, gradually became the acknowledged\r\nsupporters of the Egyptian conqueror, and connected his interests with\r\ntheir own.\r\n\r\n[Rule of Mehemet and Ibrahim.]\r\n\r\nSultan Mahmud had ratified the Preliminaries of Kutaya with wrath in his\r\nheart; and from this time all his energies were bent upon the creation of a\r\nforce which should wrest back the lost provinces and take revenge upon his\r\nrebellious vassal. As eager as Mehemet himself to reconstruct his form of\r\ngovernment upon the models of the West, though far less capable of\r\nimpressing upon his work the stamp of a single guiding will, thwarted\r\nmoreover by the jealous interference of Russia whenever his reforms seemed\r\nlikely to produce any important result, he nevertheless succeeded in\r\nintroducing something of European system and discipline into his army under\r\nthe guidance of foreign soldiers, among whom was a man then little known,\r\nbut destined long afterwards to fill Europe with his fame, the Prussian\r\nstaff-officer Moltke. On the other side Mehemet and Ibrahim knew well that\r\nthe peace was no more than an armed truce, and that what had been won by\r\narms could only be maintained by constant readiness to meet attack. Under\r\npressure of this military necessity, Ibrahim sacrificed whatever sources of\r\nstrength were open to him in the hatred borne by his new subjects to the\r\nTurkish yoke, and in their hopes of relief from oppression under his own\r\nrule. Welcomed at first as a deliverer, he soon proved a heavier\r\ntask-master than any who had gone before him. The conscription was\r\nrigorously enforced; taxation became more burdensome; the tribes who had\r\nenjoyed a wild independence in the mountains were disarmed and reduced to\r\nthe level of their fellow-subjects. Thus the discontent which had so\r\ngreatly facilitated the conquest of the border-provinces soon turned\r\nagainst the conqueror himself, and one uprising after another shook\r\nIbrahim's hold upon Mount Lebanon and the Syrian desert. The Sultan watched\r\neach outbreak against his adversary with grim joy, impatient for the moment\r\nwhen the re-organisation of his own forces should enable him to re-enter\r\nthe field and to strike an overwhelming blow.\r\n\r\n[The commerce of the Levant.]\r\n\r\nWith all its characteristics of superior intelligence in the choice of\r\nmeans, the system of Mehemet All was in its end that of the genuine\r\nOriental despot. His final object was to convert as many as possible of his\r\nsubjects into soldiers, and to draw into his treasury the profits of the\r\nlabour of all the rest. With this aim he gradually ousted from their rights\r\nof proprietorship the greater part of the land-owners of Egypt, and finally\r\nproclaimed the entire soil to be State-domain, appropriating at prices\r\nfixed by himself the whole of its produce. The natural commercial\r\nintercourse of his dominions gave place to a system of monopolies carried\r\non by the Government itself. Rapidly as this system, which was introduced\r\ninto the newly-conquered provinces, filled the coffers of Mehemet Ali, it\r\noffered to the Sultan, whose paramount authority was still acknowledged,\r\nthe means of inflicting a deadly injury upon him by a series of commercial\r\ntreaties with the European Powers, granting to western traders a free\r\nmarket throughout the Ottoman Empire. Resistance to such a measure would\r\nexpose Mehemet to the hostility of the whole mercantile interest of Europe;\r\nsubmission to it would involve the loss of a great part of that revenue on\r\nwhich his military power depended. It was probably with this result in\r\nview, rather than from any more obvious motive, that in the year 1838 the\r\nSultan concluded a new commercial Treaty with England, which was soon\r\nfollowed by similar agreements with other States.\r\n\r\n[Campaign of Nissib, June, 1839.]\r\n\r\nThe import of the Sultan's commercial policy was not lost upon Mehemet, who\r\nhad already determined to declare himself independent. He saw that war was\r\ninevitable, and bade Ibrahim collect his forces in the neighbourhood of\r\nAleppo, while the generals of the Sultan massed on the upper Euphrates the\r\ntroops that had been successfully employed in subduing the wild tribes of\r\nKurdistan. The storm was seen to be gathering, and the representatives of\r\nforeign Powers urged the Sultan, but in vain, to refrain from an enterprise\r\nwhich might shatter his empire. Mahmud was now a dying man. Exhausted by\r\nphysical excess and by the stress and passion of his long reign, he bore in\r\nhis heart the same unquenchable hatreds as of old; and while assuring the\r\nambassadors of his intention to maintain the peace, he despatched a letter\r\nto his commander-in-chief, without the knowledge of any single person,\r\nordering him to commence hostilities. The Turkish army crossed the frontier\r\non the 23rd of May, 1839. In the operations which followed, the advice and\r\nprotests of Moltke and the other European officers at head-quarters were\r\npersistently disregarded. The Turks were outmanoeuvred and cut off from\r\ntheir communications, and on the 24th of June the onslaught of Ibrahim\r\nswept them from their position at Nissib in utter rout. The whole of their\r\nartillery and stores fell into the hands of the enemy: the army dispersed.\r\nMahmud did not live to hear of the catastrophe. Six days after the battle\r\nof Nissib was fought, and while the messenger who bore the news was still\r\nin Anatolia, he expired, leaving the throne to his son, Abdul Medjid, a\r\nyouth of sixteen. Scarcely had the new Sultan been proclaimed when it\r\nbecame known that the Admiral, Achmet Fewzi, who had been instructed to\r\nattack the Syrian coast, had sailed into the port of Alexandria, and handed\r\nover the Turkish fleet to Mehemet Ali himself.\r\n\r\n[Relations of the Powers to Mehemet.]\r\n\r\n[Quadruple Treaty without France. July, 1840.]\r\n\r\nThe very suddenness of these disasters, which left the Ottoman Empire\r\nrulerless and without defence by land or sea, contributed ultimately to its\r\npreservation, inasmuch as it impelled the Powers to combined action, which,\r\nunder less urgent pressure, would probably not have been attainable. On the\r\nannouncement of the exorbitant conditions of peace demanded by Mehemet, the\r\nambassadors addressed a collective note to the Divan, requesting that no\r\nanswer might be made until the Courts had arrived at some common\r\nresolution. Soon afterwards the French and English fleets appeared at the\r\nDardanelles, nominally to protect Constantinople against the attack of the\r\nViceroy, in reality to guard against any sudden movement on the part of\r\nRussia. This display of force was, however, not necessary, for the Czar, in\r\nspite of some expressions to the contrary, had already convinced himself\r\nthat it was impossible to act upon the Treaty of Unkiar Skelessi and to\r\nmake the protectorate of Turkey the affair of Russia alone. The tone which\r\nhad been taken by the English Government during the last preceding years\r\nproved that any attempt to exercise exclusive power at Constantinople would\r\nhave been followed by war with Great Britain, in which most, if not all, of\r\nthe European Powers would have stood on the side of the latter. Abandoning\r\ntherefore the hope of attaining sole control, the Russian Government\r\naddressed itself to the task of widening as far as possible the existing\r\ndivergence between England and France. Nor was this difficult. The Cabinet\r\nof the Tuileries desired to see Mehemet Ali issue with increased strength\r\nfrom the conflict, or even to establish his dynasty at Constantinople in\r\nplace of the House of Osman. Lord Palmerston, always jealous and suspicious\r\nof Louis Philippe, refused to believe that the growth of Russian power\r\ncould be checked by dividing the Ottoman Empire, or that any system of\r\nEastern policy could be safely based on the personal qualities of a ruler\r\nnow past his seventieth year. [402] He had moreover his own causes of\r\ndiscontent with Mehemet. The possibility of establishing an overland route\r\nto India either by way of the Euphrates or of the Red Sea had lately been\r\nengaging the attention of the English Government, and Mehemet had not\r\nimproved his position by raising obstacles to either line of passage. It\r\nwas partly in consequence of the hostility of Mehemet, who was now master\r\nof a great part of Arabia, and of his known devotion to French interests,\r\nthat the port of Aden in the Red Sea was at this time occupied by England.\r\nIf, while Russia accepted the necessity of combined European action and\r\ndrew nearer to its rival, France persisted in maintaining the claim of\r\nthe Viceroy to extended dominion, the exclusion of France from the\r\nEuropean concert was the only possible result. There was no doubt as to\r\nthe attitude of the remaining Powers. Metternich, whether from genuine\r\npedantry, or in order to avoid the expression of those fears of Russia\r\nwhich really governed his Eastern policy, repeated his threadbare\r\nplatitudes on the necessity of supporting legitimate dynasties against\r\nrebels, and spoke of the victor of Konieh and Nissib as if he had been a\r\nSpanish constitutionalist or a recalcitrant German professor. The Court\r\nof Berlin followed in the same general course. In all Europe Mehemet Ali\r\nhad not a single ally, with the exception of the Government of Louis\r\nPhilippe. Under these circumstances it was of little avail to the Viceroy\r\nthat his army stood on Turkish soil without a foe before it, and that the\r\nSultan's fleet lay within his own harbour of Alexandria. The intrigues by\r\nwhich he hoped to snatch a hasty peace from the inexperience of the young\r\nSultan failed, and he learnt in October that no arrangement which he\r\nmight make with the Porte without the concurrence of the Powers would be\r\nrecognised as valid. In the meantime Russia was suggesting to the English\r\nGovernment one project after another for joint military action with the\r\nobject of driving Mehemet from Syria and restoring this province to the\r\nPorte; and at the beginning of the following year it was determined on\r\nMetternich's proposition that a Conference should forthwith be held in\r\nLondon for the settlement of Eastern affairs. The irreconcilable\r\ndifference between the intentions of France and those of the other Powers\r\nat once became evident. France proposed that all Syria and Egypt should\r\nbe given in hereditary dominion to Mehemet Ali, with no further\r\nobligation towards the Porte than the payment of a yearly tribute. The\r\ncounter-proposal of England was that Mehemet, recognising the Sultan's\r\nauthority, should have the hereditary government of Egypt alone, that he\r\nshould entirely withdraw from all Northern Syria, and hold Palestine only\r\nas an ordinary governor appointed by the Porte for his lifetime. To this\r\nproposition all the Powers with the exception of France gave their\r\nassent. Continued negotiation only brought into stronger relief the\r\nobstinacy of Lord Palmerston, and proved the impossibility of attaining\r\ncomplete agreement. At length, when it had been discovered that the\r\nFrench Cabinet was attempting to conduct a separate mediation, the Four\r\nPowers, without going through the form of asking for French sanction,\r\nsigned on the 15th of July a Treaty with the Sultan pledging themselves\r\nto enforce upon Mehemet Ali the terms arranged. The Sultan undertook in\r\nthe first instance to offer Mehemet Egypt in perpetuity and southern\r\nSyria for his lifetime. If this offer was not accepted within ten days,\r\nEgypt alone was to be offered. If at the end of twenty days Mehemet still\r\nremained obstinate, that offer in its turn was to be withdrawn, and the\r\nSultan and the Allies were to take such measures as the interests of the\r\nOttoman Empire might require. [403]\r\n\r\n[Warlike spirit in France, 1840.]\r\n\r\nThe publication of this Treaty, excluding France as it did from the concert\r\nof Europe, produced a storm of indignation at Paris. Thiers, who more than\r\nany man had by his writings stimulated the spirit of aggressive warfare\r\namong the French people and revived the worship of Napoleon, was now at the\r\nhead of the Government. His jealousy for the prestige of France, his\r\ncomparative indifference to other matters when once the national honour\r\nappeared to be committed, his sanguine estimate of the power of his\r\ncountry, rendered him a peculiarly dangerous Minister at the existing\r\ncrisis. It was not the wrongs or the danger of Mehemet Ali, but the slight\r\noffered to France, and the revived League of the Powers which had humbled\r\nit in 1814, that excited the passion of the Minister and the nation. Syria\r\nwas forgotten; the cry was for the recovery of the frontier of the Rhine,\r\nand for revenge for Waterloo. New regiments were enrolled, the fleet\r\nstrengthened, and the long-delayed fortification of Paris begun. Thiers\r\nhimself probably looked forward to a campaign in Italy, anticipating that\r\nsuccessfully conducted by Napoleon III. in 1859, rather than to an attack\r\nupon Prussia; but the general opinion both in France itself and in other\r\nstates was that, if war should break out, an invasion of Germany was\r\ninevitable. The prospect of this invasion roused in a manner little\r\nexpected the spirit of the German people. Even in the smaller states, and\r\nin the Rhenish provinces themselves, which for twenty years had shared the\r\nfortunes of France, and in which the introduction of Prussian rule in 1814\r\nhad been decidedly unpopular, a strong national movement carried everything\r\nbefore it; and the year 1840 added to the patriotic minstrelsy of Germany a\r\nwar-song, written by a Rhenish citizen, not less famous than those of 1813\r\nand 1870. [404] That there were revolutionary forces smouldering throughout\r\nEurope, from which France might in a general war have gained some\r\nassistance, the events of 1848 sufficiently proved; but to no single\r\nGovernment would a revolutionary war have been fraught with more imminent\r\nperil than to that of France itself, and to no one was this conviction more\r\nhabitually present than to King Louis Philippe. Relying upon his influence\r\nwithin the Chamber of Deputies, itself a body representing the wealth and\r\nthe caution rather than the hot spirit of France, the King refused to read\r\nat the opening of the session in October the speech drawn up for him by\r\nThiers, and accepted the consequent resignation of the Ministry. Guizot,\r\nwho was ambassador in London, and an advocate for submission to the will of\r\nEurope, was called to office, and succeeded after long debate in gaining a\r\nvote of confidence from the Chamber. Though preparations for war continued,\r\na policy of peace was now assured. Mehemet Ali was left to his fate; and\r\nthe stubborn assurance of Lord Palmerston, which had caused so much\r\nannoyance to the English Ministry itself, received a striking justification\r\nin the face of all Europe.\r\n\r\n[Ibrahim expelled from Syria, Sept.-Nov., 1840.]\r\n\r\n[Final settlement, Feb., 1841.]\r\n\r\n[The Dardanelles.]\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Allies against Mehemet Ali had now begun. While\r\nPrussia kept guard on the Rhine, and Russia undertook to protect\r\nConstantinople against any forward movement of Ibrahim, an Anglo-Austrian\r\nnaval squadron combined with a Turkish land-force in attacking the Syrian\r\ncoast-towns. The mountain-tribes of the interior were again in revolt. Arms\r\nsupplied to them by the Allies, and the insurrection soon spread over the\r\ngreater part of Syria. Ibrahim prepared for an obstinate defence, but his\r\ndispositions were frustrated by the extension of the area of conflict, and\r\nhe was unable to prevent the coast-towns from falling one after another\r\ninto the hands of the Allies. On the capture of Acre by Sir Charles Napier\r\nhe abandoned all hope of maintaining himself any longer in Syria, and made\r\nhis way with the wreck of his army towards the Egyptian frontier. Napier\r\nhad already arrived before Alexandria, and there executed a convention with\r\nthe Viceroy, by which the latter, abandoning all claim upon his other\r\nprovinces, and undertaking to restore the Turkish fleet, was assured of the\r\nhereditary possession of Egypt. The convention was one which the English\r\nadmiral had no authority to conclude, but it contained substantially the\r\nterms which the Allies intended to enforce; and after Mehemet had made a\r\nformal act of submission to the Sultan, the hereditary government of Egypt\r\nwas conferred upon himself and his family by a decree published by the\r\nSultan and sanctioned by the Powers. This compromise had been proposed by\r\nthe French Government after the expiry of the twenty days named in the\r\nTreaty of July, and immediately before the fall of M. Thiers, but\r\nPalmerston would not then listen to any demand made under open or implied\r\nthreats of war. Since that time a new and pacific Ministry had come into\r\noffice; it was no part of Palmerston's policy to keep alive the antagonism\r\nbetween England and France; and he readily accepted an arrangement which,\r\nwhile it saved France from witnessing the total destruction of an ally,\r\nleft Egypt to a ruler who, whatever his faults, had certainly shown a\r\ngreater capacity for government than any Oriental of that age. It remained\r\nfor the Powers to place upon record some authoritative statement of the law\r\nrecognised by Europe with regard to the Bosphorus and Dardanelles. Russia\r\nhad already virtually consented to the abrogation of the Treaty of Unkiar\r\nSkelessi. It now joined with all the other Powers, including France, in a\r\ndeclaration that the ancient rule of the Ottoman Empire which forbade the\r\npassage of these straits to the war-ships of all nations, except when the\r\nPorte itself should be at war, was accepted by Europe at large. Russia thus\r\nsurrendered its chance of gaining by any separate arrangement with Turkey\r\nthe permanent right of sending its fleets from the Black Sea into the\r\nMediterranean, and so becoming a Mediterranean Power. On the other hand,\r\nSebastopol and the arsenals of the Euxine remained safe against the attack\r\nof any maritime Power, unless Turkey itself should take up arms against the\r\nCzar. Having regard to the great superiority of England over Russia at sea,\r\nand to the accessibility and importance of the Euxine coast towns, it is an\r\nopen question whether the removal of all international restrictions upon\r\nthe passage of the Bosphorus and Dardanelles would not be more to the\r\nadvantage of England than of its rival. This opinion, however, had not been\r\nurged before the Crimean War, nor has it yet been accepted in our own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n[Turkey after 1840.]\r\n\r\n[Legislation of Reschid.]\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the struggle of 1840 marked with great definiteness the\r\nreal position which the Ottoman Empire was henceforth to occupy in its\r\nrelations to the western world. Rescued by Europe at large from the\r\nalternatives of destruction at the hands of Ibrahim or complete vassalage\r\nunder Russia, the Porte entered upon the condition nominally of an\r\nindependent European State, really of a State existing under the protection\r\nof Europe, and responsible to Europe as well for its domestic government as\r\nfor its alliances and for the conduct of its foreign policy. The necessity\r\nof conciliating the public opinion of the West was well understood by the\r\nTurkish statesman who had taken the leading part in the negotiations which\r\nfreed the Porte from dependence upon Russia. Reschid Pasha, the younger,\r\nForeign Minister at the accession of the new Sultan, had gained in an\r\nunusual degree the regard and the confidence of the European Ministers with\r\nwhom, as a diplomatist, he had been brought into contact. As the author of\r\na wide system of reforms, it was his ambition so to purify and renovate the\r\ninternal administration of the Ottoman Empire that the contrasts which it\r\npresented to the civilised order of the West should gradually disappear,\r\nand that Turkey should become not only in name but in reality a member of\r\nthe European world. Stimulated no doubt by the achievements of Mehemet Ali,\r\nand anxious to win over to the side of the Porte the interest which\r\nMehemet's partial adoption of European methods and ideas had excited on his\r\nbehalf, Reschid in his scheme of reform paid an ostentatious homage to the\r\nprinciples of western administration and law, proclaiming the security of\r\nperson and property, prohibiting the irregular infliction of punishment,\r\nrecognising the civil rights of Christians and Jews, and transferring the\r\ncollection of taxes from the provincial governors to the officers of the\r\ncentral authority. The friends of the Ottoman State, less experienced then\r\nthan now in the value of laws made in a society where there exists no power\r\nthat can enforce them, and where the agents of government are themselves\r\nthe most lawless of all the public enemies, hailed in Reschid's enlightened\r\nlegislation the opening of a new epoch in the life of the Christian and\r\nOriental races subject to the Sultan. But the fall of the Minister before a\r\npalace-intrigue soon proved on how slight a foundation these hopes were\r\nbuilt. Like other Turkish reformers, Reschid had entered upon a hopeless\r\ntask; and the name of the man who was once honoured as the regenerator of a\r\ngreat Empire is now almost forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nEurope during the Thirty-years' Peace--Italy and Austria--Mazzini--The\r\nHouse of Savoy--Gioberti--Election of Pius IX.--Reforms expected--\r\nRevolution at Palermo--Agitation in Northern Italy--Lombardy--State of\r\nthe Austrian Empire--Growth of Hungarian National Spirit--The Magyars and\r\nSlavs--Transylvania--Parties among the Magyars--Kossuth--The Slavic\r\nNational Movements in Austria--The Government enters on Reform in\r\nHungary--Policy of the Opposition--The Rural System of Austria--\r\nInsurrection in Galicia: the Nobles and the Peasants--Agrarian\r\nEdict--Public Opinion in Vienna--Prussia--Accession and Character of King\r\nFrederick William IV.--Convocation of the United Diet--Its Debates and\r\nDissolution--France--The Spanish Marriages--Reform Movement--Socialism--\r\nRevolution of February--End of the Orleanist Monarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe characteristic of Continental history during the second quarter of this\r\ncentury is the sense of unrest. The long period of European peace which\r\nbegan in 1815 was not one of internal repose; the very absence of those\r\nengrossing and imperious interests which belong to a time of warfare gave\r\nfreer play to the feelings of discontent and the vague longings for a\r\nbetter political order which remained behind after the convulsions of the\r\nrevolutionary epoch and the military rule of Napoleon had passed away.\r\nDuring thirty years of peace the breach had been widening between those\r\nGovernments which still represented the system of 1815, and the peoples\r\nover whom they ruled. Ideas of liberty, awakenings of national sense, were\r\nfar more widely diffused in Europe than at the time of the revolutionary\r\nwar. The seed then prematurely forced into an atmosphere of storm and\r\nreaction had borne its fruit: other growths, fertilised or accelerated by\r\nWestern Liberalism, but not belonging to the same family, were springing up\r\nin unexpected strength, and in regions which had hitherto lain outside the\r\nmovement of the modern world. New forces antagonistic to Government had\r\ncome into being, penetrating an area unaffected by the constitutional\r\nstruggles of the Mediterranean States, or by the weaker political efforts\r\nof Germany. In the homes of the Magyar and the Slavic subjects of Austria,\r\nso torpid throughout the agitation of an earlier time, the passion of\r\nnationality was every hour gaining new might. The older popular causes,\r\nvanquished for the moment by one reaction after another, had silently\r\nestablished a far stronger hold on men's minds. Working, some in exile and\r\nconspiracy, others through such form of political literature as the\r\njealousy of Governments permitted, the leaders of the democratic movement\r\nupon the Continent created a power before which the established order at\r\nlength succumbed. They had not created, nor was it possible under the\r\ncircumstances that they should create, an order which was capable of taking\r\nits place.\r\n\r\n[Italy. 1831-1848.]\r\n\r\nItaly, rather than France, forms the central figure in any retrospect of\r\nEurope immediately before 1848 in which the larger forces at work are not\r\nobscured by those for the moment more prominent. The failure of the\r\ninsurrection of 1831 had left Austria more visibly than before master over\r\nthe Italian people even in those provinces in which Austria was not\r\nnominally sovereign. It had become clear that no effort after reform could\r\nbe successful either in the Papal States or in the kingdom of Naples so\r\nlong as Austria held Lombardy and Venice. The expulsion of the foreigner\r\nwas therefore not merely the task of those who sought to give the Italian\r\nrace its separate and independent national existence, it was the task of\r\nall who would extinguish oppression and misgovernment in any part of the\r\nItalian peninsula. Until the power of Austria was broken, it was vain to\r\ntake up arms against the tyranny of the Duke of Modena or any other\r\ncontemptible oppressor. Austria itself had twice taught this lesson; and if\r\nthe restoration of Neapolitan despotism in 1821 could be justified by the\r\ndisorderly character of the Government then suppressed, the circumstances\r\nattending the restoration of the Pope's authority in 1831 had extinguished\r\nAustria's claim to any sort of moral respect; for Metternich himself had\r\nunited with the other European Courts in declaring the necessity for\r\nreforms in the Papal Government, and of these reforms, though a single\r\nearnest word from Austria would have enforced their execution, not one had\r\nbeen carried into effect. Gradually, but with increasing force as each\r\nunhappy year passed by, the conviction gained weight among all men of\r\nserious thought that the problem to be faced was nothing less than the\r\ndestruction of the Austrian yoke. Whether proclaimed as an article of faith\r\nor veiled in diplomatic reserve, this belief formed the common ground among\r\nmen whose views on the immediate future of Italy differed in almost every\r\nother particular.\r\n\r\n[Mazzini.]\r\n\r\nThree main currents of opinion are to be traced in the ferment of ideas\r\nwhich preceded the Italian revolution of 1848. At a time not rich in\r\nintellectual or in moral power, the most striking figure among those who\r\nare justly honoured as the founders of Italian independence is perhaps that\r\nof Mazzini. Exiled during nearly the whole of his mature life, a\r\nconspirator in the eyes of all Governments, a dreamer in the eyes of the\r\nworld, Mazzini was a prophet or an evangelist among those whom his\r\ninfluence led to devote themselves to the one cause of their country's\r\nregeneration. No firmer faith, no nobler disinterestedness, ever animated\r\nthe saint or the patriot; and if in Mazzini there was also something of the\r\nvisionary and the fanatic, the force with which he grasped the two vital\r\nconditions of Italian revival--the expulsion of the foreigner and the\r\nestablishment of a single national Government--proves him to have been a\r\nthinker of genuine political insight. Laying the foundation of his creed\r\ndeep in the moral nature of man, and constructing upon this basis a fabric\r\nnot of rights but of duties, he invested the political union with the\r\nimmediateness, the sanctity, and the beauty of family life. With him, to\r\nlive, to think, to hope, was to live, to think, to hope for Italy; and the\r\nItaly of his ideal was a Republic embracing every member of the race,\r\npurged of the priestcraft and the superstition which had degraded the man\r\nto the slave, indebted to itself alone for its independence, and\r\nconsolidated by the reign of equal law. The rigidity with which Mazzini\r\nadhered to his own great project in its completeness, and his impatience\r\nwith any bargaining away of national rights, excluded him from the work of\r\nthose practical politicians and men of expedients who in 1859 effected with\r\nforeign aid the first step towards Italian union; but the influence of his\r\nteaching and his organisation in preparing his countrymen for independence\r\nwas immense; and the dynasty which has rendered to United Italy services\r\nwhich Mazzini thought impossible, owes to this great Republican scarcely\r\nless than to its ablest friends.\r\n\r\n[Hopes of Piedmont.]\r\n\r\nWidely separated from the school of Mazzini in temper and intention was the\r\ngroup of politicians and military men, belonging mostly to Piedmont, who\r\nlooked to the sovereign and the army of this State as the one hope of Italy\r\nin its struggle against foreign rule. The House of Savoy, though foreign in\r\nits origin, was, and had been for centuries, a really national dynasty. It\r\nwas, moreover, by interest and traditional policy, the rival rather than\r\nthe friend of Austria in Northern Italy. If the fear of revolution had at\r\ntimes brought the Court of Turin into close alliance with Vienna, the\r\nconnection had but thinly veiled the lasting antagonism of two States\r\nwhich, as neighbours, had habitually sought expansion each at the other's\r\ncost. Lombardy, according to the expression of an older time, was the\r\nartichoke which the Kings of Piedmont were destined to devour leaf by leaf.\r\nAustria, on the other hand, sought extension towards the Alps: it had in\r\n1799 clearly shown its intention of excluding the House of Savoy altogether\r\nfrom the Italian mainland; and the remembrance of this epoch had led the\r\nrestored dynasty in 1815 to resist the plans of Metternich for establishing\r\na league of all the princes of Italy under Austria's protection. The\r\nsovereign, moreover, who after the failure of the constitutional movement\r\nof 1821 had mounted the throne surrounded by Austrian bayonets, was no\r\nlonger alive. Charles Albert of Carignano, who had at that time played so\r\nambiguous a part, and whom Metternich had subsequently endeavoured to\r\nexclude from the succession, was on the throne. He had made his peace with\r\nabsolutism by fighting in Spain against the Cortes in 1823; and since his\r\naccession to the throne he had rigorously suppressed the agitation of\r\nMazzini's partizans within his own dominions. But in spite of strong\r\nclerical and reactionary influences around him, he had lately shown an\r\nindependence of spirit in his dealings with Austria which raised him in the\r\nestimation of his subjects; and it was believed that his opinions had been\r\ndeeply affected by the predominance which the idea of national independence\r\nwas now gaining over that of merely democratic change. If the earlier\r\ncareer of Charles Albert himself cast some doubt upon his personal\r\nsincerity, and much more upon his constancy of purpose, there was at least\r\nin Piedmont an army thoroughly national in its sentiment, and capable of\r\ntaking the lead whenever the opportunity should arise for uniting Italy\r\nagainst the foreigner. In no other Italian State was there an effective\r\nmilitary force, or one so little adulterated with foreign elements.\r\n\r\n[Hopes of the Papacy.]\r\n\r\nA third current of opinion in these years of hope and of illusion was that\r\nrepresented in the writings of Gioberti, the depicter of a new and glorious\r\nItaly, regenerated not by philosophic republicanism or the sword of a\r\ntemporal monarch, but by the moral force of a reformed and reforming\r\nPapacy. The conception of the Catholic Church as a great Liberal power,\r\nstrange and fantastic as it now appears, was no dream of an isolated\r\nItalian enthusiast; it was an idea which, after the French Revolution of\r\n1830, and the establishment of a government at once anti-clerical and\r\nanti-democratic, powerfully influenced some of the best minds in France,\r\nand found in Montalembert and Lamennais exponents who commanded the ear of\r\nEurope. If the corruption of the Papacy had been at once the spiritual and\r\nthe political death of Italy, its renovation in purity and in strength\r\nwould be also the resurrection of the Italian people. Other lands had\r\nsought, and sought in vain, to work out their problems under the guidance\r\nof leaders antagonistic to the Church, and of popular doctrines divorced\r\nfrom religious faith. To Italy belonged the prerogative of spiritual power.\r\nBy this power, aroused from the torpor of ages, and speaking, as it had\r\nonce spoken, to the very conscience of mankind, the gates of a glorious\r\nfuture would be thrown open. Conspirators might fret, and politicians\r\nscheme, but the day on which the new life of Italy would begin would be\r\nthat day when the head of the Church, taking his place as chief of a\r\nfederation of Italian States, should raise the banner of freedom and\r\nnational right, and princes and people alike should follow the\r\nall-inspiring voice.\r\n\r\n[Election of Pius IX., June, 1846.]\r\n\r\n[Reforms expected from Pius.]\r\n\r\n[Ferrara, June, 1847.]\r\n\r\nA monk, ignorant of everything but cloister lore, benighted, tyrannical,\r\nthe companion in his private life of a few jolly priests and a gossiping\r\nbarber, was not an alluring emblem of the Church of the future. But in 1846\r\nPope Gregory XVI., who for the last five years had been engaged in one\r\nincessant struggle against insurgents, conspirators, and reformers, and\r\nwhose prisons were crowded with the best of his subjects, passed away.\r\n[405] His successor, Mastai Ferretti, Bishop of Imola, was elected under\r\nthe title of Pius IX., after the candidate favoured by Austria had failed\r\nto secure the requisite number of votes (June 17). The choice of this\r\nkindly and popular prelate was to some extent a tribute to Italian feeling;\r\nand for the next eighteen months it appeared as it Gioberti had really\r\ndivined the secret of the age. The first act of the new Pope was the\r\npublication of a universal amnesty for political offences. The prison doors\r\nthroughout his dominions were thrown open, and men who had been sentenced\r\nto confinement for life returned in exultation to their homes. The act\r\ncreated a profound impression throughout Italy, and each good-humoured\r\nutterance of Pius confirmed the belief that great changes were at hand. A\r\nwild enthusiasm seized upon Rome. The population abandoned itself to\r\nfestivals in honour of the Pontiff and of the approaching restoration of\r\nRoman liberty. Little was done; not much was actually promised; everything\r\nwas believed. The principle of representative government was discerned in\r\nthe new Council of State now placed by the side of the College of\r\nCardinals; a more serious concession was made to popular feeling in the\r\npermission given to the citizens of Rome, and afterwards to those of the\r\nprovinces, to enrol themselves in a civic guard. But the climax of\r\nexcitement was reached when, in answer to a threatening movement of\r\nAustria, occasioned by the growing agitation throughout Central Italy, the\r\nPapal Court protested against the action of its late protector. By the\r\nTreaties of Vienna Austria had gained the right to garrison the citadel of\r\nFerrara, though this town lay within the Ecclesiastical States. Placing a\r\nnew interpretation on the expression used in the Treaties, the Austrian\r\nGovernment occupied the town of Ferrara itself (June 17th, 1847). The\r\nmovement was universally understood to be the preliminary to a new\r\noccupation of the Papal States, like that of 1831; and the protests of the\r\nPope against the violation of his territory gave to the controversy a\r\nEuropean importance. The English and French fleets appeared at Naples; the\r\nKing of Sardinia openly announced his intention to take the field against\r\nAustria if war should break out. By the efforts of neutral Powers a\r\ncompromise on the occupation of Ferrara was at length arranged; but the\r\npassions which had been excited were not appeased, and the Pope remained in\r\npopular imagination the champion of Italian independence against Austria,\r\nas well as the apostle of constitutional Government and the rights of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n[Revolution at Palermo, Jan., 1848.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the agitation begun in Rome was spreading through the north\r\nand the south of the peninsula, and beyond the Sicilian Straits. The\r\ncentenary of the expulsion of the Austrians from Genoa in December, 1746,\r\nwas celebrated throughout central Italy with popular demonstrations which\r\ngave Austria warning of the storm about to burst upon it. In the south,\r\nhowever, impatience under domestic tyranny was a far more powerful force\r\nthan the distant hope of national independence. Sicily had never forgotten\r\nthe separate rights which it had once enjoyed, and the constitution given\r\nto it under the auspices of England in 1812. Communications passed between\r\nthe Sicilian leaders and the opponents of the Bourbon Government on the\r\nmainland, and in the autumn of 1847 simultaneous risings took place in\r\nCalabria and at Messina. These were repressed without difficulty; but the\r\nfire smouldered far and wide, and on the 13th of January, 1848, the\r\npopulation of Palermo rose in revolt. For fourteen days the conflict\r\nbetween the people and the Neapolitan troops continued. The city was\r\nbombarded, but in the end the people were victorious, and a provisional\r\ngovernment was formed by the leaders of the insurrection. One Sicilian town\r\nafter another followed the example of the capital, and expelled its\r\nNeapolitan garrison. Threatened by revolution in Naples itself, King\r\nFerdinand II., grandson of the despot of 1821, now imitated the policy of\r\nhis predecessor, and proclaimed a constitution. A Liberal Ministry was\r\nformed, but no word was said as to the autonomy claimed by Sicily, and\r\npromised, as it would seem, by the leaders of the popular party on the\r\nmainland. After the first excitement of success was past, it became clear\r\nthat the Sicilians were as widely at variance with the newly-formed\r\nGovernment at Naples as with that which they had overthrown.\r\n\r\n[Agitation in Austrian Italy.]\r\n\r\nThe insurrection of Palermo gave a new stimulus and imparted more of\r\nrevolutionary colour to the popular movement throughout Italy.\r\nConstitutions were granted in Piedmont and Tuscany. In the Austrian\r\nprovinces national exasperation against the rule of the foreigner grew\r\ndaily more menacing. Radetzky, the Austrian Commander-in-chief, had long\r\nforeseen the impending struggle, and had endeavoured, but not with complete\r\nsuccess, to impress his own views upon the imperial Government. Verona had\r\nbeen made the centre of a great system of fortifications, and the strength\r\nof the army under Radetzky's command had been considerably increased, but\r\nit was not until the eleventh hour that Metternich abandoned the hope of\r\ntiding over difficulties by his old system of police and spies, and\r\npermitted the establishment of undisguised military rule. In order to\r\ninjure the finances of Austria, a general resolution had been made by the\r\npatriotic societies of Upper Italy to abstain from the use of tobacco, from\r\nwhich the Government drew a large part of its revenue. On the first Sunday\r\nin 1848 Austrian officers, smoking in the streets of Milan, were attacked\r\nby the people. The troops were called to arms: a conflict took place, and\r\nenough blood was shed to give to the tumult the importance of an actual\r\nrevolt. In Padua and elsewhere similar outbreaks followed. Radetzky issued\r\na general order to his troops, declaring that the Emperor was determined to\r\ndefend his Italian dominion whether against an external or domestic foe.\r\nMartial law was proclaimed; and for a moment, although Piedmont gave signs\r\nof throwing itself into the Italian movement, the awe of Austria's military\r\npower hushed the rising tempest. A few weeks more revealed to an astonished\r\nworld the secret that the Austrian State, so great and so formidable in the\r\neyes of friend and foe, was itself on the verge of dissolution.\r\n\r\n[Austria.]\r\n\r\n[Affairs in Hungary.]\r\n\r\nIt was to the absence of all stirring public life, not to any real\r\nassimilative power or any high intelligence in administration, that the\r\nHouse of Hapsburg owed, during the eighteenth century, the continued union\r\nof that motley of nations or races which successive conquests, marriages,\r\nand treaties had brought under its dominion. The violence of the attack\r\nmade by the Emperor Joseph upon all provincial rights first re-awakened the\r\nslumbering spirit of Hungary; but the national movement of that time, which\r\nexcited such strong hopes and alarms, had been succeeded by a long period\r\nof stagnation, and during the Napoleonic wars the repression of everything\r\nthat appealed to any distinctively national spirit had become more avowedly\r\nthan before the settled principle of the Austrian Court. In 1812 the\r\nHungarian Diet had resisted the financial measures of the Government. The\r\nconsequence was that, in spite of the law requiring its convocation every\r\nthree years, the Diet was not again summoned till 1825. During the\r\nintermediate period, the Emperor raised taxes and levies by edict alone.\r\nDeprived of its constitutional representation, the Hungarian nobility\r\npursued its opposition to the encroachments of the Crown in the Sessions of\r\neach county. At these assemblies, to which there existed no parallel in the\r\nwestern and more advanced States of the Continent, each resident land-owner\r\nwho belonged to the very numerous caste of the noblesse was entitled to\r\nspeak and to vote. Retaining, in addition to the right of free discussion\r\nand petition, the appointment of local officials, as well as a considerable\r\nshare in the actual administration, the Hungarian county-assemblies,\r\nhanding down a spirit of rough independence from an immemorial past, were\r\nprobably the hardiest relic of self-government existing in any of the great\r\nmonarchical States of Europe. Ignorant, often uncouth in their habits,\r\noppressive to their peasantry, and dominated by the spirit of race and\r\ncaste, the mass of the Magyar nobility had indeed proved as impervious to\r\nthe humanising influences of the eighteenth century as they had to the\r\nsolicitations of despotism. The Magnates, or highest order of noblesse, who\r\nformed a separate chamber in the Diet, had been to some extent\r\ndenationalised; they were at once more European in their culture, and more\r\nsubmissive to the Austrian Court. In banishing political discussion from\r\nthe Diet to the County Sessions, the Emperor's Government had intensified\r\nthe provincial spirit which it sought to extinguish. Too numerous to be won\r\nover by personal inducements, and remote from the imperial agencies which\r\nhad worked so effectively through the Chamber of Magnates, the lesser\r\nnobility of Hungary during these years of absolutism carried the habit of\r\npolitical discussion to their homes, and learnt to baffle the imperial\r\nGovernment by withholding all help and all information from its subordinate\r\nagents. Each county-assembly became a little Parliament, and a centre of\r\nresistance to the usurpation of the Crown. The stimulus given to the\r\nnational spirit by this struggle against unconstitutional rule was seen not\r\nless in the vigorous attacks made upon the Government on the re-assembling\r\nof the Diet in 1825, than in the demand that Magyar, and not Latin as\r\nheretofore, should be the language used in recording the proceedings of the\r\nDiet, and in which communications should pass between the Upper and the\r\nLower House.\r\n\r\n[Magyars and Slavs.]\r\n\r\nThere lay in this demand for the recognition of the national language the\r\ngerm of a conflict of race against race which was least of all suspected by\r\nthose by whom the demand was made. Hungary, as a political unity,\r\ncomprised, besides the Slavic kingdom of Croatia, wide regions in which the\r\ninhabitants were of Slavic or Roumanian race, and where the Magyar was\r\nknown only as a feudal lord. The district in which the population at large\r\nbelonged to the Magyar stock did not exceed one-half of the kingdom. For\r\nthe other races of Hungary, who were probably twice as numerous as\r\nthemselves, the Magyars entertained the utmost contempt, attributing to\r\nthem the moral qualities of the savage, and denying to them the possession\r\nof any nationality whatever. In a country combining so many elements\r\nill-blended with one another, and all alike subject to a German Court at\r\nVienna, Latin, as the language of the Church and formerly the language of\r\ninternational communication, had served well as a neutral means of\r\nexpression in public affairs. There might be Croatian deputies in the Diet\r\nwho could not speak Magyar; the Magyars could not understand Croatian; both\r\ncould understand and could without much effort express themselves in the\r\nspecies of Latin which passed muster at Presburg and at Vienna. Yet no\r\nfreedom of handling could convert a dead language into a living one; and\r\nwhen the love of country and of ancient right became once more among the\r\nMagyars an inspiring passion, it naturally sought a nobler and more\r\nspontaneous utterance than dog-latin. Though no law was passed upon the\r\nsubject in the Parliament in which it was first mooted, speakers in the\r\nDiet of 1832 used their mother-tongue; and when the Viennese Government\r\nforbade the publication of the debates, reports were circulated in\r\nmanuscript through the country by Kossuth, a young deputy, who after the\r\ndissolution of the Diet in 1836 paid for his defiance of the Emperor by\r\nthree years' imprisonment.\r\n\r\n[Hungary after 1830.]\r\n\r\n[The Diet of 1832-36.]\r\n\r\n[Széchenyi.]\r\n\r\nHungary now seemed to be entering upon an epoch of varied and rapid\r\nnational development. The barriers which separated it from the Western\r\nworld were disappearing. The literature, the ideas, the inventions of\r\nWestern Europe were penetrating its archaic society, and transforming a\r\nmovement which in its origin had been conservative and aristocratic into\r\none of far-reaching progress and reform. Alone among the opponents of\r\nabsolute power on the Continent, the Magyars had based their resistance on\r\npositive constitutional right, on prescription, and the settled usage of\r\nthe past; and throughout the conflict with the Crown between 1812 and 1825\r\nlegal right was on the side not of the Emperor but of those whom he\r\nattempted to coerce. With excellent judgment the Hungarian leaders had\r\nduring these years abstained from raising any demand for reforms,\r\nappreciating the advantage of a purely defensive position in a combat with\r\na Court pledged in the eyes of all Europe, as Austria was, to the defence\r\nof legitimate rights. This policy had gained its end; the Emperor, after\r\nthirteen years of conflict, had been forced to re-convoke the Diet, and to\r\nabandon the hope of effecting a work in which his uncle, Joseph II., had\r\nfailed. But, the constitution once saved, that narrow and exclusive body of\r\nrights for which the nobility had contended no longer satisfied the needs\r\nor the conscience of the time. [406] Opinion was moving fast; the claims of\r\nthe towns and of the rural population were making themselves felt; the\r\nagitation that followed the overthrow of the Bourbons in 1830 reached\r\nHungary too, not so much through French influence as through the Polish war\r\nof independence, in which the Magyars saw a struggle not unlike their own,\r\nenlisting their warmest sympathies for the Polish armies so long as they\r\nkept the field, and for the exiles who came among them when the conflict\r\nwas over. By the side of the old defenders of class-privilege there arose\r\nmen imbued with the spirit of modern Liberalism. The laws governing the\r\nrelation of the peasant to his lord, which remained nearly as they had been\r\nleft by Maria Theresa, were dealt with by the Diet of 1832 in so liberal a\r\nspirit that the Austrian Government, formerly far in advance of Hungarian\r\nopinion on this subject, refused its assent to many of the measures passed.\r\nGreat schemes of social and material improvement also aroused the public\r\nhopes in these years. The better minds became conscious of the real aspect\r\nof Hungarian life in comparison with that of civilised Europe--of its\r\npoverty, its inertia, its boorishness. Extraordinary energy was thrown into\r\nthe work of advance by Count Széchenyi, a nobleman whose imagination had\r\nbeen fired by the contrast which the busy industry of Great Britain and the\r\npractical interests of its higher classes presented to the torpor of his\r\nown country. It is to him that Hungary owes the bridge uniting its double\r\ncapital at Pesth, and that Europe owes the unimpeded navigation of the\r\nDanube, which he first rendered possible by the destruction of the rocks\r\nknown as the Iron Gates at Orsova. Sanguine, lavishly generous, an ardent\r\npatriot, Széchenyi endeavoured to arouse men of his own rank, the great and\r\nthe powerful in Hungary, to the sense of what was due from them to their\r\ncountry as leaders in its industrial development. He was no revolutionist,\r\nnor was he an enemy to Austria. A peaceful political future would best have\r\naccorded with his own designs for raising Hungary to its due place among\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n[Transylvania.]\r\n\r\nThat the Hungarian movement of this time was converted from one of fruitful\r\nprogress into an embittered political conflict ending in civil war was due,\r\namong other causes, to the action of the Austrian Cabinet itself. Wherever\r\nconstitutional right existed, there Austria saw a natural enemy. The\r\nprovince of Transylvania, containing a mixed population of Magyars,\r\nGermans, and Roumanians, had, like Hungary, a Diet of its own, which Diet\r\nought to have been summoned every year. It was, however, not once assembled\r\nbetween 1811 and 1834. In the agitation at length provoked in Transylvania\r\nby this disregard of constitutional right, the Magyar element naturally\r\ntook the lead, and so gained complete ascendancy in the province. When the\r\nDiet met in 1834, its language and conduct were defiant in the highest\r\ndegree. It was speedily dissolved, and the scandal occasioned by its\r\nproceedings disturbed the last days of the Emperor Francis, who died in\r\n1835, leaving the throne to his son Ferdinand, an invalid incapable of any\r\nserious exertion. It soon appeared that nothing was changed in the\r\nprinciples of the Imperial Government, and that whatever hopes had been\r\nformed of the establishment of a freer system under the new reign were\r\ndelusive. The leader of the Transylvanian Opposition was Count Wesselényi,\r\nhimself a Magnate in Hungary, who, after the dissolution of the Diet,\r\nbetook himself to the Sessions of the Hungarian counties, and there\r\ndelivered speeches against the Court which led to his being arrested and\r\nbrought to trial for high treason. His cause was taken up by the Hungarian\r\nDiet, as one in which the rights of the local assemblies were involved. The\r\nplea of privilege was, however, urged in vain, and the sentence of exile\r\nwhich was passed upon Count Wesselényi became a new source of contention\r\nbetween the Crown and the Magyar Estates. [407]\r\n\r\n[Parties among the Magyars.]\r\n\r\n[The Diet of 1843.]\r\n\r\nThe enmity of Government was now a sufficient passport to popular favour.\r\nOn emerging from his prison under a general amnesty in 1840, Kossuth\r\nundertook the direction of a Magyar journal at Pesth, which at once gained\r\nan immense influence throughout the country. The spokesman of a new\r\ngeneration, Kossuth represented an entirely different order of ideas from\r\nthose of the orthodox defenders of the Hungarian Constitution. They had\r\nbeen conservative and aristocratic; he was revolutionary: their weapons had\r\nbeen drawn from the storehouse of Hungarian positive law; his inspiration\r\nwas from the Liberalism of western Europe. Thus within the national party\r\nitself there grew up sections in more or less pronounced antagonism to one\r\nanother, though all were united by a passionate devotion to Hungary and by\r\nan unbounded faith in its future. Széchenyi, and those who with him\r\nsubordinated political to material ends, regarded Kossuth as a dangerous\r\ntheorist. Between the more impetuous and the more cautious reformers stood\r\nthe recognised Parliamentary leaders of the Liberals, among whom Deák had\r\nalready given proof of political capacity of no common order. In Kossuth's\r\njournal the national problems of the time were discussed both by his\r\nopponents and by his friends. Publicity gave greater range as well as\r\ngreater animation to the conflict of ideas; and the rapid development of\r\nopinion during these years was seen in the large and ambitious measures\r\nwhich occupied the Diet of 1843. Electoral and municipal reform, the\r\ncreation of a code of criminal law, the introduction of trial by jury, the\r\nabolition of the immunity of the nobles from taxation; all these, and\r\nsimilar legislative projects, displayed at once the energy of the time and\r\nthe influence of western Europe in transforming the political conceptions\r\nof the Hungarian nation. Hitherto the forty-three Free Cities had possessed\r\nbut a single vote in the Diet, as against the sixty-three votes possessed\r\nby the Counties. It was now generally admitted that this anomaly could not\r\ncontinue; but inasmuch as civic rights were themselves monopolised by small\r\nprivileged orders among the townsmen, the problem of constitutional reform\r\ncarried with it that of a reform of the municipalities. Hungary in short\r\nwas now face to face with the task of converting its ancient system of the\r\nrepresentation of the privileged orders into the modern system of a\r\nrepresentation of the nation at large. Arduous at every epoch and in every\r\ncountry, this work was one of almost insuperable difficulty in Hungary,\r\nthrough the close connection with the absolute monarchy of Austria; through\r\nthe existence of a body of poor noblesse, numbered at two hundred thousand,\r\nwho, though strong in patriotic sentiment, bitterly resented any attack\r\nupon their own freedom from taxation; and above all through the variety of\r\nraces in Hungary, and the attitude assumed by the Magyars, as the dominant\r\nnationality, towards the Slavs around them. In proportion as the energy of\r\nthe Magyars and their confidence in the victory of the national cause\r\nmounted high, so rose their disdain of all claims beside their own within\r\nthe Hungarian kingdom. It was resolved by the Lower Chamber of the Diet of\r\n1843 that no language but Magyar should be permitted in debate, and that at\r\nthe end of ten years every person not capable of speaking the Magyar\r\nlanguage should be excluded from all public employment. The Magnates\r\nsoftened the latter provision by excepting from it the holders of merely\r\nlocal offices in Slavic districts; against the prohibition of Latin in the\r\nDiet the Croatians appealed to the Emperor. A rescript arrived from Vienna\r\nplacing a veto upon the resolution. So violent was the storm excited in the\r\nDiet itself by this rescript, and so threatening the language of the\r\nnational leaders outside, that the Cabinet, after a short interval, revoked\r\nits decision, and accepted a compromise which, while establishing Magyar as\r\nthe official language of the kingdom, and requiring that it should be\r\ntaught even in Croatian schools, permitted the use of Latin in the Diet for\r\nthe next six years. In the meantime the Diet had shouted down every speaker\r\nwho began with the usual Latin formula, and fighting had taken place in\r\nAgram, the Croatian capital, between the national and the Magyar factions.\r\n\r\n[The Slavic national movements.]\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that the effort was made at Presburg to resist all claims\r\nbut those of one race. The same quickening breath which had stirred the\r\nMagyar nation to new life had also passed over the branches of the Slavic\r\nfamily within the Austrian dominions far and near. In Bohemia a revival of\r\ninterest in the Czech language and literature, which began about 1820, had\r\nin the following decade gained a distinctly political character. Societies\r\noriginally or professedly founded for literary objects had become the\r\ncentres of a popular movement directed towards the emancipation of the\r\nCzech elements in Bohemia from German ascendancy, and the restoration of\r\nsomething of a national character to the institutions of the kingdom. Among\r\nthe southern Slavs, with whom Hungary was more directly concerned, the\r\nnational movement first became visible rather later. Its earliest\r\nmanifestations took, just as in Bohemia, a literary or linguistic form.\r\nProjects for the formation of a common language which, under the name of\r\nIllyrian, should draw together all the Slavic populations between the\r\nAdriatic and the Black Sea, occupied for a while the fancy of the learned;\r\nbut the more ambitious part of this design, which had given some umbrage to\r\nthe Turkish Government, was abandoned in obedience to instructions from\r\nVienna; and the movement first gained political importance when its scope\r\nwas limited to the Croatian and Slavonic districts of Hungary, and it was\r\nendowed with the distinct task of resisting the imposition of Magyar as an\r\nofficial language. In addition to their representation in the Diet of the\r\nKingdom at Presburg, the Croatian landowners had their own Provincial Diet\r\nat Agram. In this they possessed not only a common centre of action, but an\r\norgan of communication with the Imperial Government at Vienna, which\r\nrendered them some support in their resistance to Magyar pretensions. Later\r\nevents gave currency to the belief that a conflict of races in Hungary was\r\ndeliberately stimulated by the Austrian Court in its own interest. But the\r\nwhole temper and principle of Metternich's rule was opposed to the\r\ndevelopment of national spirit, whether in one race or another; and the\r\npatronage which the Croats appeared at this time to receive at Vienna was\r\nprobably no more than an instinctive act of conservatism, intended to\r\nmaintain the balance of interests, and to reduce within the narrowest\r\npossible limits such changes as might prove inevitable.\r\n\r\n[Agitation after 1843.]\r\n\r\nOf all the important measures of reform which were brought before the\r\nHungarian Diet of 1843, one alone had become law. The rest were either\r\nrejected by the Chamber of Magnates after passing the Lower House, or were\r\nthrown out in the Lower House in spite of the approval of the majority, in\r\nconsequence of peremptory instructions sent to Presburg by the county\r\nassemblies. The representative of a Hungarian constituency was not free to\r\nvote at his discretion; he was the delegate of the body of nobles which\r\nsent him, and was legally bound to give his vote in accordance with the\r\ninstructions which he might from time to time receive. However zealous the\r\nLegislature itself, it was therefore liable to be paralysed by external\r\npressure as soon as any question was raised which touched the privileges of\r\nthe noble caste. This was especially the case with all projects involving\r\nthe expenditure of public revenue. Until the nobles bore their share of\r\ntaxation it was impossible that Hungary should emerge from a condition of\r\nbeggarly need; yet, be the inclination of the Diet what it might, it was\r\ncontrolled by bodies of stubborn squires or yeomen in each county, who\r\nfully understood their own power, and stoutly forbade the passing of any\r\nmeasure which imposed a share of the public burdens upon themselves. The\r\nimpossibility of carrying out reforms tinder existing conditions had been\r\ndemonstrated by the failures of 1843. In order to overcome the obstruction\r\nas well of the Magnates as of the county assemblies, it was necessary that\r\nan appeal should be made to the country at large, and that a force of\r\npublic sentiment should be aroused which should both overmaster the\r\nexisting array of special interests, and give birth to legislation merging\r\nthem for the future in a comprehensive system of really national\r\ninstitutions. To this task the Liberal Opposition addressed itself; and\r\nalthough large differences existed within the party, and the action of\r\nKossuth, who now exchanged the career of the journalist for that of the\r\norator, was little fettered by the opinions of his colleagues, the general\r\nresult did not disappoint the hopes that had been formed. Political\r\nassociations and clubs took vigorous root in the country. The magic of\r\nKossuth's oratory left every hearer a more patriotic, if not a wiser man;\r\nand an awakening passion for the public good seemed for a while to throw\r\nall private interests into the shade.\r\n\r\n[Government Policy of Reform.]\r\n\r\n[Programme of the Opposition.]\r\n\r\nIt now became plain to all but the blindest that great changes were\r\ninevitable; and at the instance of the more intelligent among the\r\nConservative party in Hungary the Imperial Government resolved to enter the\r\nlists with a policy of reform, and, if possible, to wrest the helm from the\r\nmen who were becoming masters of the nation. In order to secure a majority\r\nin the Diet, it was deemed requisite by the Government first to gain a\r\npredominant influence in the county-assemblies. As a preliminary step, most\r\nof the Lieutenants of counties, to whose high dignity no practical\r\nfunctions attached, were removed from their posts, and superseded by paid\r\nadministrators, appointed from Vienna. Count Apponyi, one of the most\r\nvigorous of the conservative and aristocratic reformers, was placed at the\r\nhead of the Ministry. In due time the proposals of the Government were made\r\npublic. They comprised the taxation of the nobles, a reform of the\r\nmunicipalities, modifications in the land-system, and a variety of economic\r\nmeasures intended directly to promote the material development of the\r\ncountry. The latter were framed to some extent on the lines laid down by\r\nSzéchenyi, who now, in bitter antagonism to Kossuth, accepted office under\r\nthe Government, and gave to it the prestige of his great name. It remained\r\nfor the Opposition to place their own counter-proposals before the country.\r\nDifferences within the party were smoothed over, and a manifesto, drawn up\r\nby Deák, gave statesmanlike expression to the aims of the national leaders.\r\nEmbracing every reform included in the policy of the Government, it added\r\nto them others which the Government had not ventured to face, and gave to\r\nthe whole the character of a vindication of its own rights by the nation,\r\nin contrast to a scheme of administrative reform worked out by the officers\r\nof the Crown. Thus while it enforced the taxation of the nobles, it claimed\r\nfor the Diet the right of control over every branch of the national\r\nexpenditure. It demanded increased liberty for the Press, and an unfettered\r\nright of political association; and finally, while doing homage to the\r\nunity of the Crown, it required that the Government of Hungary should be\r\none in direct accord with the national representation in the Diet, and that\r\nthe habitual effort of the Court of Vienna to place this kingdom on the\r\nsame footing as the Emperor's non-constitutional provinces should be\r\nabandoned. With the rival programmes of the Government and the Opposition\r\nbefore it, the country proceeded to the elections of 1847. Hopefulness and\r\nenthusiasm abounded on every side; and at the close of the year the Diet\r\nassembled from which so great a work was expected, and which was destined\r\nwithin so short a time to witness, in storm and revolution, the passing\r\naway of the ancient order of Hungarian life.\r\n\r\n[The Rural System of Hungary.]\r\n\r\nThe directly constitutional problems with which the Diet of Presburg had to\r\ndeal were peculiar to Hungary itself, and did not exist in the other parts\r\nof the Austrian Empire. There were, however, social problems which were not\r\nless urgently forcing themselves upon public attention alike in Hungary and\r\nin those provinces which enjoyed no constitutional rights. The chief of\r\nthese was the condition of the peasant-population. In the greater part of\r\nthe Austrian dominions, though serfage had long been abolished, society was\r\nstill based upon the manorial system. The peasant held his land subject to\r\nthe obligation of labouring on his lord's domain for a certain number of\r\ndays in the year, and of rendering him other customary services: the\r\nmanor-court, though checked by the neighbourhood of crown-officers,\r\nretained its jurisdiction, and its agents frequently performed duties of\r\npolice. Hence the proposed extinction of the so-called feudal tie, and the\r\nconversion of the semi-dependent cultivator into a freeholder bound only to\r\nthe payment of a fixed money-charge, or rendered free of all obligation by\r\nthe surrender of a part of his holding, involved in many districts the\r\ninstitution of new public authorities and a general reorganisation of the\r\nminor local powers. From this task the Austrian Government had shrunk in\r\nmere lethargy, even when, as in 1835, proposals for change had come from\r\nthe landowners themselves. The work begun by Maria Theresa and Joseph\r\nremained untouched, though thirty years of peace had given abundant\r\nopportunity for its completion, and the legislation of Hardenberg in 1810\r\nafforded precedents covering at least part of the field.\r\n\r\n[Insurrection in Galicia, Feb., 1846.]\r\n\r\n[Rural Edict, Dec., 1845.]\r\n\r\nAt length events occurred which roused the drowsiest heads in Vienna from\r\ntheir slumbers. The party of action among the Polish refugees at Paris had\r\ndetermined to strike another blow for the independence of their country.\r\nInstead, however, of repeating the insurrection of Warsaw, it was arranged\r\nthat the revolt should commence in Prussian and Austrian Poland, and the\r\nbeginning of the year 1846 was fixed for the uprising. In Prussia the\r\nGovernment crushed the conspirators before a blow could be struck. In\r\nAustria, though ample warning was given, the precautions taken were\r\ninsufficient. General Collin occupied the Free City of Cracow, where the\r\nrevolutionary committee had its headquarters; but the troops under his\r\ncommand were so weak that he was soon compelled to retreat, and to await\r\nthe arrival of reinforcements. Meanwhile the landowners in the district of\r\nTarnow in northern Galicia raised the standard of insurrection, and sought\r\nto arm the country. The Ruthenian peasantry, however, among whom they\r\nlived, owed all that was tolerable in their condition to the protection of\r\nthe Austrian crown-officers, and detested the memory of an independent\r\nPoland. Instead of following their lords into the field, they gave\r\ninformation of their movements, and asked instructions from the nearest\r\nAustrian authorities. They were bidden to seize upon any persons who\r\ninstigated them to rebellion, and to bring them into the towns. A war of\r\nthe peasants against the nobles forthwith broke out. Murder, pillage, and\r\nincendiary fires brought both the Polish insurrection and its leaders to a\r\nmiserable end. The Polish nobles, unwilling to acknowledge the humiliating\r\ntruth that their own peasants were their bitterest enemies, charged the\r\nAustrian Government with having set a price on their heads, and with having\r\ninstigated the peasants to a communistic revolt. Metternich, disgraced by\r\nthe spectacle of a Jacquerie raging apparently under his own auspices,\r\ninsisted, in a circular to the European Courts, that the attack of the\r\npeasantry upon the nobles had been purely spontaneous, and occasioned by\r\nattempts to press certain villagers into the ranks of the rebellion by\r\nbrute force. But whatever may have been the measure of responsibility\r\nincurred by the agents of the Government, an agrarian revolution was\r\nundoubtedly in full course in Galicia, and its effects were soon felt in\r\nthe rest of the Austrian monarchy. The Arcadian contentment of the rural\r\npopulation, which had been the boast, and in some degree the real strength,\r\nof Austria, was at an end. Conscious that the problem which it had so long\r\nevaded must at length be faced, the Government of Vienna prepared to deal\r\nwith the conditions of land-tenure by legislation extending over the whole\r\nof the Empire. But the courage which was necessary for an adequate solution\r\nof the difficulty nowhere existed within the official world, and the Edict\r\nwhich conveyed the last words of the Imperial Government on this vital\r\nquestion contained nothing more than a series of provisions for\r\nfacilitating voluntary settlements between the peasants and their lords. In\r\nthe quality of this enactment the Court of Vienna gave the measure of its\r\nown weakness. The opportunity of breaking with traditions of impotence had\r\npresented itself and had been lost. Revolution was at the gates; and in the\r\nunsatisfied claim of the rural population the Government had handed over to\r\nits adversaries a weapon of the greatest power. [408]\r\n\r\n[Vienna.]\r\n\r\nIn the purely German provinces of Austria there lingered whatever of the\r\nspirit of tranquillity was still to be found within the Empire. This,\r\nhowever, was not the case in the districts into which the influence of the\r\ncapital extended. Vienna had of late grown out of its old careless spirit.\r\nThe home in past years of a population notoriously pleasure-loving,\r\ngood-humoured, and indifferent to public affairs, it had now taken\r\nsomething of a more serious character. The death of the Emperor Francis,\r\nwho to the last generation of Viennese had been as fixed a part of the\r\norder of things as the river Danube, was not unconnected with this change\r\nin the public tone. So long as the old Emperor lived, all thought that was\r\ngiven to political affairs was energy thrown away. By his death not only\r\nhad the State lost an ultimate controlling power, if dull, yet practised\r\nand tenacious, but this loss was palpable to all the world. The void stood\r\nbare and unrelieved before the public eye. The notorious imbecility of the\r\nEmperor Ferdinand, the barren and antiquated formalism of Metternich and of\r\nthat entire system which seemed to be incorporated in him, made Government\r\nan object of general satire, and in some quarters of rankling contempt. In\r\nproportion as the culture and intelligence of the capital exceeded that of\r\nother towns, so much the more galling was the pressure of that part of the\r\ngeneral system of tutelage which was especially directed against the\r\nindependence of the mind. The censorship was exercised with grotesque\r\nstupidity. It was still the aim of Government to isolate Austria from the\r\nideas and the speculation of other lands, and to shape the intellectual\r\nworld of the Emperor's subjects into that precise form which tradition\r\nprescribed as suitable for the members of a well-regulated State. In\r\npoetry, the works of Lord Byron were excluded from circulation, where\r\ncustom-house officers and market-inspectors chose to enforce the law; in\r\nhistory and political literature, the leading writers of modern times lay\r\nunder the same ban. Native production was much more effectively controlled.\r\nWhoever wrote in a newspaper, or lectured at a University, or published a\r\nwork of imagination, was expected to deliver himself of something agreeable\r\nto the constituted authorities, or was reduced to silence. Far as Vienna\r\nfell short of Northern Germany in intellectual activity, the humiliation\r\ninflicted on its best elements by this life-destroying surveillance was\r\nkeenly felt and bitterly resented. More perhaps by its senile warfare\r\nagainst mental freedom than by any acts of direct political repression, the\r\nGovernment ranged against itself the almost unanimous opinion of the\r\neducated classes. Its hold on the affection of the capital was gone. Still\r\nquiescent, but ready to unite against the Government when opportunity\r\nshould arrive, there stood, in addition to the unorganised mass of the\r\nmiddle ranks, certain political associations and students' societies, a\r\nvigorous Jewish element, and the usual contingent furnished by poverty and\r\ndiscontent in every great city from among the labouring population.\r\nMilitary force sufficient to keep the capital in subjection was not\r\nwanting; but the foresight and the vigour necessary to cope with the first\r\nonset of revolution were nowhere to be found among the holders of power.\r\n\r\n[Prussia.]\r\n\r\n[Frederick William IV., 1840.]\r\n\r\nAt Berlin the solid order of Prussian absolutism already shook to its\r\nfoundation. With King Frederick William III., whose long reign ended in\r\n1840, there departed the half-filial, half-spiritless acquiescence of the\r\nnation in the denial of the liberties which had been so solemnly promised\r\nto it at the epoch of Napoleon's fall. The new Sovereign, Frederick William\r\nIV., ascended the throne amid high national hopes. The very contrast which\r\nhis warm, exuberant nature offered to the silent, reserved disposition of\r\nhis father impressed the public for awhile in his favour. In the more\r\nshining personal qualities he far excelled all his immediate kindred. His\r\nartistic and literary sympathies, his aptitude of mind and readiness of\r\nspeech, appeared to mark the man of a new age, and encouraged the belief\r\nthat, in spite of the mediæval dreams and reactionary theories to which,\r\nas prince, he had surrendered himself, he would, as King, appreciate the\r\nneeds of the time, and give to Prussia the free institutions which the\r\nnation demanded. The first acts of the new reign were generously conceived.\r\nPolitical offenders were freely pardoned. Men who had suffered for their\r\nopinions were restored to their posts in the Universities and the public\r\nservice, or selected for promotion. But when the King approached the\r\nconstitutional question, his utterances were unsatisfactory. Though\r\nundoubtedly in favour of some reform, he gave no sanction to the idea of a\r\nreally national representation, but seemed rather to seek occasions to\r\ncondemn it. Other omens of ill import were not wanting. Allying his\r\nGovernment with a narrow school of theologians, the King offended men of\r\nindependent mind, and transgressed against the best traditions of Prussian\r\nadministration. The prestige of the new reign was soon exhausted. Those who\r\nhad believed Frederick William to be a man of genius now denounced him as a\r\nvaporous, inflated dilettante; his enthusiasm was seen to indicate nothing\r\nin particular; his sonorous commonplaces fell flat on second delivery. Not\r\nonly in his own kingdom, but in the minor German States, which looked to\r\nPrussia as the future leader of a free Germany, the opinion rapidly gained\r\nground that Frederick William IV. was to be numbered among the enemies\r\nrather than the friends of the good cause.\r\n\r\n[United Diet convoked at Berlin, Feb. 3, 1847.]\r\n\r\nIn the Edicts by which the last King of Prussia had promised his people a\r\nConstitution, it had been laid down that the representative body was to\r\nspring from the Provincial Estates, and that it was to possess, in addition\r\nto its purely consultative functions in legislation, a real power of\r\ncontrol over all State loans and over all proposed additions to taxation.\r\nThe interdependence of the promised Parliament and the Provincial Estates\r\nhad been seen at the time to endanger the success of Hardenberg's scheme;\r\nnevertheless, it was this conception which King Frederick William IV. made\r\nthe very centre of his Constitutional policy. A devotee to the distant\r\npast, he spoke of the Provincial Estates, which in their present form had\r\nexisted only since 1823, as if they were a great national and historic\r\ninstitution which had come down unchanged through centuries. His first\r\nexperiment was the summoning of a Committee from these bodies to consider\r\ncertain financial projects with which the Government was occupied (1842).\r\nThe labours of the Committee were insignificant, nor was its treatment at\r\nthe hands of the Crown Ministers of a serious character. Frederick William,\r\nhowever, continued to meditate over his plans, and appointed a Commission\r\nto examine the project drawn up at his desire by the Cabinet. The agitation\r\nin favour of Parliamentary Government became more and more pressing among\r\nthe educated classes; and at length, in spite of some opposition from his\r\nbrother, the Prince of Prussia, afterwards Emperor of Germany, the King\r\ndetermined to fulfil his father's promise and to convoke a General Assembly\r\nat Berlin. On the 3rd of February, 1847, there appeared a Royal Patent,\r\nwhich summoned all the Provincial Estates to the capital to meet as a\r\nUnited Diet of the Kingdom. The Diet was to be divided into two Chambers,\r\nthe Upper Chamber including the Royal Princes and highest nobles, the Lower\r\nthe representatives of the knights, towns, and peasants. The right of\r\nlegislation was not granted to the Diet; it had, however, the right of\r\npresenting petitions on internal affairs. State-loans and new taxes were\r\nnot, in time of peace, to be raised without its consent. No regular\r\ninterval was fixed for the future meetings of the Diet, and its financial\r\nrights were moreover reduced by other provisions, which enacted that a\r\nUnited Committee from the Provincial Estates was to meet every four years\r\nfor certain definite objects, and that a special Delegation was to sit each\r\nyear for the transaction of business relating to the National Debt. [409]\r\n\r\n[King Frederick William and the Diet.]\r\n\r\nThe nature of the General Assembly convoked by this Edict, the functions\r\nconferred upon it, and the guarantees offered for Representative Government\r\nin the future, so little corresponded with the requirements of the nation,\r\nthat the question was at once raised in Liberal circles whether the\r\nconcessions thus tendered by the King ought to be accepted or rejected. The\r\ndoubt which existed as to the disposition of the monarch himself was\r\nincreased by the speech from the throne at the opening of the Diet (April\r\n11). In a vigorous harangue extending over half an hour, King Frederick\r\nWilliam, while he said much that was appropriate to the occasion, denounced\r\nthe spirit of revolution that was working in the Prussian Press, warned the\r\nDeputies that they had been summoned not to advocate political theories,\r\nbut to protect each the rights of his own order, and declared that no power\r\non earth should induce him to change his natural relation to his people\r\ninto a constitutional one, or to permit a written sheet of paper to\r\nintervene like a second Providence between Prussia and the Almighty. So\r\nvehement was the language of the King, and so uncompromising his tone, that\r\nthe proposal was forthwith made at a private conference that the Deputies\r\nshould quit Berlin in a body. This extreme course was not adopted; it was\r\ndetermined instead to present an address to the King, laying before him in\r\nrespectful language the shortcomings in the Patent of February 3rd. In the\r\ndebate on this address began the Parliamentary history of Prussia. The\r\nLiberal majority in the Lower Chamber, anxious to base their cause on some\r\nfoundation of positive law, treated the Edicts of Frederick William III.\r\ndefining the rights of the future Representative Body as actual statutes of\r\nthe realm, although the late King had never called a Representative Body\r\ninto existence. From this point of view the functions now given to\r\nCommittees and Delegations were so much illegally withdrawn from the rights\r\nof the Diet. The Government, on the other hand, denied that the Diet\r\npossessed any rights or claims whatever beyond those assigned to it by the\r\nPatent of February 3rd, to which it owed its origin. In receiving the\r\naddress of the Chambers, the King, while expressing a desire to see the\r\nConstitution further developed, repeated the principle already laid down\r\nby his Ministers, and refused to acknowledge any obligation outside those\r\nwhich he had himself created.\r\n\r\n[Proceedings and Dissolution of the Diet.]\r\n\r\nWhen, after a series of debates on the political questions at issue, the\r\nactual business of the Session began, the relations between the Government\r\nand the Assembly grew worse rather than better. The principal measures\r\nsubmitted were the grant of a State-guarantee to certain land-banks\r\nestablished for the purpose of extinguishing the rent-charges on peasants'\r\nholdings, and the issue of a public loan for the construction of railways\r\nby the State. Alleging that the former measure was not directly one of\r\ntaxation, the Government, in laying it before the Diet, declared that they\r\nasked only for an opinion, and denied that the Diet possessed any right of\r\ndecision. Thus challenged, as it were, to make good its claims, the Diet\r\nnot only declined to assent to this guarantee, but set its veto on the\r\nproposed railway-loan. Both projects were in themselves admitted to be to\r\nthe advantage of the State; their rejection by the Diet was an emphatic\r\nvindication of constitutional rights which the Government seemed indisposed\r\nto acknowledge. Opposition grew more and more embittered; and when, as a\r\npreliminary to the dissolution of the Diet, the King ordered its members to\r\nproceed to the election of the Committees and Delegation named in the Edict\r\nof February 3rd, an important group declined to take part in the elections,\r\nor consented to do so only under reservations, on the ground that the Diet,\r\nand that alone, possessed the constitutional control over finance which the\r\nKing was about to commit to other bodies. Indignant at this protest, the\r\nKing absented himself from the ceremony which brought the Diet to a close\r\n(June 26th). Amid general irritation and resentment the Assembly broke up.\r\nNothing had resulted from its convocation but a direct exhibition of the\r\nantagonism of purpose existing between the Sovereign and the national\r\nrepresentatives. Moderate men were alienated by the doctrines promulgated\r\nfrom the Throne; and an experiment which, if more wisely conducted, might\r\npossibly at the eleventh hour have saved all Germany from revolution, left\r\nthe Monarchy discredited and exposed to the attack of the most violent of\r\nits foes.\r\n\r\n[Louis Philippe.]\r\n\r\nThe train was now laid throughout central Europe; it needed but a flash\r\nfrom Paris to kindle the fire far and wide. That the Crown which Louis\r\nPhilippe owed to one popular outbreak might be wrested from him by another,\r\nhad been a thought constantly present not only to the King himself but to\r\nforeign observers during the earlier years of his reign. The period of\r\ncomparative peace by which the first Republican movements after 1830 had\r\nbeen succeeded, the busy working of the Parliamentary system, the keen and\r\nsuccessful pursuit of wealth which seemed to have mastered all other\r\nimpulses in France, had made these fears a thing of the past. The Orleanist\r\nMonarchy had taken its place among the accredited institutions of Europe;\r\nits chief, aged, but vigorous in mind, looked forward to the future of his\r\ndynasty, and occupied himself with plans for extending its influence or its\r\nsway beyond the limits of France itself. At one time Louis Philippe had\r\nhoped to connect his family by marriage with the Courts of Vienna or\r\nBerlin; this project had not met with encouragement; so much the more\r\neagerly did the King watch for opportunities in another direction, and\r\ndevise plans for restoring the family-union between France and Spain which\r\nhad been established by Louis XIV. and which had so largely influenced the\r\nhistory of Europe down to the overthrow of the Bourbon Monarchy. The Crown\r\nof Spain was now held by a young girl; her sister was the next in\r\nsuccession; to make the House of Orleans as powerful at Madrid as it was at\r\nParis seemed under these circumstances no impossible task to a King and a\r\nMinister who, in the interests of the dynasty, were prepared to make some\r\nsacrifice of honour and good faith.\r\n\r\n[The Spanish Marriage, October, 1846.]\r\n\r\nWhile the Carlist War was still continuing, Lord Palmerston had convinced\r\nhimself that Louis Philippe intended to marry the young Queen Isabella, if\r\npossible, to one of his sons. Some years later this project was\r\nunofficially mentioned by Guizot to the English statesman, who at once\r\ncaused it to be understood that England would not permit the union.\r\nAbandoning this scheme, Louis Philippe then demanded, by a misconstruction\r\nof the Treaty of Utrecht, that the Queen's choice of a husband should be\r\nlimited to the Bourbons of the Spanish or Neapolitan line. To this claim\r\nLord Aberdeen, who had become Foreign Secretary in 1841, declined to give\r\nhis assent; he stated, however, that no step would be taken by England in\r\nantagonism to such marriage, if it should be deemed desirable at Madrid.\r\nLouis Philippe now suggested that his youngest son, the Duke of\r\nMontpensier, should wed the Infanta Fernanda, sister of the Queen of Spain.\r\nOn the express understanding that this marriage should not take place until\r\nthe Queen should herself have been married and have had children, the\r\nEnglish Cabinet assented to the proposal. That the marriages should not be\r\nsimultaneous was treated by both Governments as the very heart and\r\nsubstance of the arrangement, inasmuch as the failure of children by the\r\nQueen's marriage would make her sister, or her sister's heir, inheritor of\r\nthe Throne. This was repeatedly acknowledged by Louis Philippe and his\r\nMinister, Guizot, in the course of communications with the British Court\r\nwhich extended over some years. Nevertheless, in 1846, the French\r\nAmbassador at Madrid, in conjunction with the Queen's mother, Maria\r\nChristina, succeeded in carrying out a plan by which the conditions laid\r\ndown at London and accepted at Paris were utterly frustrated. Of the\r\nQueen's Spanish cousins, there was one, Don Francisco, who was known to be\r\nphysically unfit for marriage. To this person it was determined by Maria\r\nChristina and the French Ambassador that the young Isabella should be\r\nunited, her sister being simultaneously married to the Duke of Montpensier.\r\nSo flagrantly was this arrangement in contradiction to the promises made at\r\nthe Tuileries, that, when intelligence of it arrived at Paris, Louis\r\nPhilippe declared for a moment that the Ambassador must be disavowed and\r\ndisgraced. Guizot, however, was of better heart than his master, and asked\r\nfor delay. In the very crisis of the King's perplexity the return of Lord\r\nPalmerston to office, and the mention by him of a Prince of Saxe-Coburg as\r\none of the candidates for the Spanish Queen's hand, afforded Guizot a\r\npretext for declaring that Great Britain had violated its engagements\r\ntowards the House of Bourbon by promoting the candidature of a Coburg. In\r\nreality the British Government had not only taken no part in assisting the\r\ncandidature of the Coburg Prince, but had directly opposed it. This,\r\nhowever, was urged in vain at the Tuileries. Whatever may have been the\r\noriginal intentions of Louis Philippe or of Guizot, the temptation of\r\nsecuring the probable succession to the Spanish Crown was too strong to be\r\nresisted. Preliminaries were pushed forward with the utmost haste, and on\r\nthe 10th of October, 1846, the marriages of Queen Isabella and her sister,\r\nas arranged by the French Ambassador and the Queen-Mother, were\r\nsimultaneously solemnised at Madrid. [410]\r\n\r\n[Louis Philippe and Guizot, 1847.]\r\n\r\nFew intrigues have been more disgraceful than that of the Spanish\r\nMarriages; none more futile. The course of history mocked its ulterior\r\npurposes; its immediate results were wholly to the injury of the House of\r\nOrleans. The cordial understanding between France and Great Britain, which\r\nhad been revived after the differences of 1840, was now finally shattered,\r\nLouis Philippe stood convicted before his people of sacrificing a valuable\r\nalliance to purely dynastic ends; his Minister, the austere and\r\nsanctimonious Guizot, had to defend himself against charges which would\r\nhave covered with shame the most hardened man of the world. Thus stripped\r\nof its garb of moral superiority, condemned as at once unscrupulous and\r\nunpatriotic, the Orleanist Monarchy had to meet the storm of popular\r\ndiscontent which was gathering over France as well as over neighbouring\r\nlands. For the lost friendship of England it was necessary to seek a\r\nsubstitute in the support of some Continental Power. Throwing himself into\r\nthe reactionary policy of the Court of Vienna, Guizot endeavoured to\r\nestablish a diplomatic concert from which England should be excluded, as\r\nFrance had been in 1840. There were circumstances which gave some\r\ncountenance to the design. The uncompromising vigour with which Lord\r\nPalmerston supported the Liberal movement now becoming so formidable in\r\nItaly made every absolute Government in Europe his enemy; and had time been\r\ngranted, the despotic Courts would possibly have united with France in some\r\nmore or less open combination against the English Minister. But the moments\r\nwere now numbered; and ere the projected league could take substance, the\r\nwhirlwind descended before which Louis Philippe and his Minister were the\r\nfirst to fall.\r\n\r\n[Demand for Parliamentary Reform.]\r\n\r\nA demand for the reform of the French Parliamentary system had been made\r\nwhen Guizot was entering upon office in the midst of the Oriental crisis of\r\n1840. It had then been silenced and repressed by all the means at the\r\ndisposal of the Executive; King Louis Philippe being convinced that with a\r\nmore democratic Chamber the maintenance of his own policy of peace would be\r\nimpossible. The demand was now raised again with far greater energy.\r\nAlthough the franchise had been lowered after the Revolution of July, it\r\nwas still so high that not one person in a hundred and fifty possessed a\r\nvote, while the property-qualification which was imposed upon the Deputies\r\nthemselves excluded from the Chamber all but men of substantial wealth.\r\nMoreover, there existed no law prohibiting the holders of administrative\r\nposts under the Government from sitting in the Assembly. The consequence\r\nwas that more than one-third of the Deputies were either officials who had\r\nsecured election, or representatives who since their election had accepted\r\nfrom Government appointments of greater or less value. Though Parliamentary\r\ntalent abounded, it was impossible that a Chamber so composed could be the\r\nrepresentative of the nation at large. The narrowness of the franchise, the\r\nwealth of the Deputies themselves, made them, in all questions affecting\r\nthe social condition of the people, a mere club of capitalists; the\r\ninfluence which the Crown exercised through the bestowal of offices\r\nconverted those who ought to have been its controllers into its dependents,\r\nthe more so as its patronage was lavished on nominal opponents even more\r\nfreely than on avowed friends. Against King Louis Philippe the majority in\r\nthe Chamber had in fact ceased to possess a will of its own. It represented\r\nwealth; it represented to some extent the common-sense of France; but on\r\nall current matters of dispute it only represented the executive government\r\nin another form. So thoroughly had the nation lost all hope in the Assembly\r\nduring the last years of Louis Philippe, that even the elections had ceased\r\nto excite interest. On the other hand, the belief in the general prevalence\r\nof corruption was every day receiving new warrant. A series of State-trials\r\ndisclosed the grossest frauds in every branch of the administration, and\r\nproved that political influence was habitually used for purposes of\r\npecuniary gain. Taxed with his tolerance of a system scarcely\r\ndistinguishable from its abuses, the Minister could only turn to his own\r\nnominees in the Chamber and ask them whether they felt themselves\r\ncorrupted; invited to consider some measure of Parliamentary reform, he\r\nscornfully asserted his policy of resistance. Thus, hopeless of obtaining\r\nsatisfaction either from the Government or from the Chamber itself, the\r\nleaders of the Opposition resolved in 1847 to appeal to the country at\r\nlarge; and an agitation for Parliamentary reform, based on the methods\r\nemployed by O'Connell in Ireland, soon spread through the principal towns\r\nof France.\r\n\r\n[Socialism.]\r\n\r\nBut there were other ideas and other forces active among the labouring\r\npopulation of Paris than those familiar to the politicians of the Assembly.\r\nTheories of Socialism, the property of a few thinkers and readers during\r\nthe earlier years of Louis Philippe's reign, had now sunk deep among the\r\nmasses, and become, in a rough and easily apprehended form, the creed of\r\nthe poor. From the time when Napoleon's fall had restored to France its\r\nfaculty of thought, and, as it were, turned the soldier's eyes again upon\r\nhis home, those questionings as to the basis of the social union which had\r\noccupied men's minds at an earlier epoch were once more felt and uttered.\r\nThe problem was still what it had been in the eighteenth century; the\r\nanswer was that of a later age. Kings, priests, and nobles had been\r\noverthrown, but misery still covered the world. In the teaching of\r\nSaint-Simon, under the Restoration, religious conceptions blended with a\r\ngreat industrial scheme; in the Utopia of Fourier, produced at the same\r\nfruitful period, whatever was valuable belonged to its suggestions in\r\nco-operative production. But whether the doctrine propounded was that of\r\nphilosopher, or sage, or charlatan, in every case the same leading ideas\r\nwere visible;--the insufficiency of the individual in isolation, the\r\nindustrial basis of all social life, the concern of the community, or of\r\nits supreme authority, in the organisation of labour. It was naturally in\r\nno remote or complex form that the idea of a new social order took\r\npossession of the mind of the workman in the faubourgs of Paris. He read in\r\nLouis Blanc, the latest and most intelligible of his teachers of the right\r\nto labour, of the duty of the State to provide work for its citizens. This\r\nwas something actual and tangible. For this he was ready upon occasion to\r\ntake up arms; not for the purpose of extending the franchise to another\r\nhandful of the Bourgeoisie, or of shifting the profits of government from\r\none set of place-hunters to another. In antagonism to the ruling Minister\r\nthe Reformers in the Chamber and the Socialists in the streets might for a\r\nmoment unite their forces: but their ends were irreconcilable, and the\r\nallies of to-day were necessarily the foes of to-morrow.\r\n\r\n[The February Revolution, 1848.]\r\n\r\n[Feb. 22nd.]\r\n\r\nAt the close of the year 1847 the last Parliament of the Orleanist Monarchy\r\nassembled. The speech from the Throne, delivered by Louis Philippe himself,\r\ndenounced in strong terms the agitation for Reform which had been carried\r\non during the preceding months, though this agitation had, on the whole,\r\nbeen the work of the so-called Dynastic Opposition, which, while demanding\r\nelectoral reform, was sincerely loyal to the Monarchy. The King's words\r\nwere a challenge; and in the debate on the Address, the challenge was taken\r\nup by all ranks of Monarchical Liberals as well as by the small Republican\r\nsection in the Assembly. The Government, however, was still secure of its\r\nmajority. Defeated in the votes on the Address, the Opposition determined,\r\nby way of protest, to attend a banquet to be held in the Champs Elysées on\r\nthe 22nd of February by the Reform-party in Western Paris. It was at first\r\ndesired that by some friendly arrangement with the Government, which had\r\ndeclared the banquet illegal, the possibility of recourse to violence\r\nshould be avoided. Misunderstandings, however, arose, and the Government\r\nfinally prohibited the banquet, and made preparations for meeting any\r\ndisturbance with force of arms. The Deputies, anxious to employ none but\r\nlegal means of resistance, now resolved not to attend the banquet; on the\r\nother hand, the Democratic and Socialist leaders welcomed a possible\r\nopportunity for revolt. On the morning of the 22nd masses of men poured\r\nwestwards from the workmen's quarter. The city was in confusion all day,\r\nand the erection of barricades began. Troops were posted in the streets; no\r\nserious attack, however, was made by either side, and at nightfall quiet\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n[Feb. 23rd.]\r\n\r\nOn the next morning the National Guard of Paris was called to arms.\r\nThroughout the struggle between Louis Philippe and the populace of Paris in\r\nthe earlier years of his reign, the National Guard, which was drawn\r\nprincipally from the trading classes, had fought steadily for the King.\r\nNow, however, it was at one with the Liberal Opposition in the Assembly,\r\nand loudly demanded the dismissal of the Ministers. While some of the\r\nbattalions interposed between the regular troops and the populace and\r\naverted a conflict, others proceeded to the Chamber with petitions for\r\nReform. Obstinately as Louis Philippe had hitherto refused all concession,\r\nthe announcement of the threatened defection of the National Guard at\r\nlength convinced him that resistance was impossible. He accepted Guizot's\r\nresignation, and the Chamber heard from the fallen Minister himself that he\r\nhad ceased to hold office. Although the King declined for awhile to commit\r\nthe formation of a Ministry to Thiers, the recognised chief of the\r\nOpposition, and endeavoured to place a politician more acceptable to\r\nhimself in office, it was felt that with the fall of Guizot all real\r\nresistance to Reform was broken. Nothing more was asked by the\r\nParliamentary Opposition or by the middle-class of Paris. The victory\r\nseemed to be won, the crisis at an end. In the western part of the capital\r\ncongratulation and good-humour succeeded to the fear of conflict. The\r\ntroops fraternised with the citizens and the National Guard; and when\r\ndarkness came on, the boulevards were illuminated as if for a national\r\nfestival.\r\n\r\n[Feb. 24th.]\r\n\r\nIn the midst, however, of this rejoicing, and while the chiefs of the\r\nrevolutionary societies, fearing that the opportunity had been lost for\r\nstriking a blow at the Monarchy, exhorted the defenders of the barricades\r\nto maintain their positions, a band of workmen came into conflict,\r\naccidentally or of set purpose, with the troops in front of the Foreign\r\nOffice. A volley was fired, which killed or wounded eighty persons. Placing\r\nthe dead bodies on a waggon, and carrying them by torchlight through the\r\nstreets in the workmen's quarter, the insurrectionary leaders called the\r\npeople to arms. The tocsin sounded throughout the night; on the next\r\nmorning the populace marched against the Tuileries. In consequence of the\r\nfall of the Ministry and the supposed reconciliation of the King with the\r\nPeople, whatever military dispositions had been begun had since been\r\nabandoned. At isolated points the troops fought bravely; but there was no\r\nsystematic defence. Shattered by the strain of the previous days, and\r\ndismayed by the indifference of the National Guard when he rode out among\r\nthem, the King, who at every epoch of his long life had shown such\r\nconspicuous courage in the presence of danger, now lost all nerve and all\r\nfaculty of action. He signed an act of abdication in favour of his\r\ngrandson, the Count of Paris, and fled. Behind him the victorious mob burst\r\ninto the Tuileries and devastated it from cellar to roof. The Legislative\r\nChamber, where an attempt was made to proclaim the Count of Paris King, was\r\nin its turn invaded. In uproar and tumult a Provisional Government was\r\ninstalled at the Hôtel de Ville; and ere the day closed the news went out\r\nto Europe that the House of Orleans had ceased to reign, and that the\r\nRepublic had been proclaimed. It was not over France alone, it was over the\r\nContinent at large, that the tide of revolution was breaking.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.

To those\r\nwho could so look back across the space of sixty years, a comparison of the\r\nEuropean movements that followed the successive onslaughts upon authority\r\nin France afforded some measure of the change that had passed over the\r\npolitical atmosphere of the Continent within a single lifetime. The\r\nRevolution of 1789, deeply as it stirred men's minds in neighbouring\r\ncountries, had occasioned no popular outbreak on a large scale outside\r\nFrance. The expulsion of Charles X. in 1830 had been followed by national\r\nuprisings in Italy, Poland, and Belgium, and by a struggle for\r\nconstitutional government in the smaller States of Northern Germany. The\r\ndownfall of Louis Philippe in 1848 at once convulsed the whole of central\r\nEurope. From the Rhenish Provinces to the Ottoman frontier there was no\r\ngovernment but the Swiss Republic that was not menaced; there was no race\r\nwhich did not assert its claim to a more or less complete independence.\r\nCommunities whose long slumber had been undisturbed by the shocks of the\r\nNapoleonic period now vibrated with those same impulses which, since 1815,\r\nno pressure of absolute power had been able wholly to extinguish in Italy\r\nand Germany. The borders of the region of political discontent had been\r\nenlarged; where apathy, or immemorial loyalty to some distant crown, had\r\nlong closed the ear to the voices of the new age, now all was restlessness,\r\nall eager expectation of the dawning epoch of national life. This was\r\nespecially the case with the Slavic races included in the Austrian Empire,\r\nraces which during the earlier years of this century had been wholly mute.\r\nThese in their turn now felt the breath of patriotism, and claimed the\r\nright of self-government. Distinct as the ideas of national independence\r\nand of constitutional liberty are in themselves, they were not distinct in\r\ntheir operation over a great part of Europe in 1848; and this epoch will be\r\nwrongly conceived if it is viewed as no more than a repetition on a large\r\nscale of the democratic outbreak of Paris with which it opened. More was\r\nsought in Europe in 1848 than the substitution of popular for monarchical\r\nor aristocratic rule. The effort to make the State one with the nation\r\nexcited wider interests than the effort to enlarge and equalise citizen\r\nrights; and it is in the action of this principle of nationality that we\r\nfind the explanation of tendencies of the epoch which appear at first view\r\nto be in direct conflict with one another. In Germany a single race was\r\ndivided under many Governments: here the national instinct impelled to\r\nunity. In Austria a variety of races was held together by one crown: here\r\nthe national instinct impelled to separation. In both these States, as in\r\nItaly, where the predominance of the foreigner and the continuance of\r\ndespotic government were in a peculiar manner connected with one another,\r\nthe efforts of 1848 failed; but the problems which then agitated Europe\r\ncould not long be set aside, and the solution of them complete, in the case\r\nof Germany and Italy, partial and tentative in the case of Austria, renders\r\nthe succeeding twenty-five years a memorable period in European history.\r\n\r\n[Agitation in Western Germany.]\r\n\r\nThe sudden disappearance of the Orleanist monarchy and the proclamation of\r\nthe Republic at Paris struck with dismay the Governments beyond the Rhine.\r\nDifficulties were already gathering round them, opposition among their own\r\nsubjects was daily becoming more formidable and more outspoken. In Western\r\nGermany a meeting of Liberal deputies had been held in the autumn of 1847,\r\nin which the reform of the Federal Constitution and the establishment of a\r\nGerman Parliament had been demanded: a Republican or revolutionary party,\r\nsmall but virulent, had also its own avowed policy and its recognised\r\norgans in the press. No sooner had the news of the Revolution at Paris\r\npassed the frontier than in all the minor German States the cry for reform\r\nbecame irresistible. Ministers everywhere resigned; the popular demands\r\nwere granted; and men were called to office whose names were identified\r\nwith the struggle for the freedom of the Press, for trial by jury, and for\r\nthe reform of the Federal Constitution. The Federal Diet itself, so long\r\nthe instrument of absolutism, bowed beneath the stress of the time,\r\nabolished the laws of censorship, and invited the Governments to send\r\nCommissioners to Frankfort to discuss the reorganisation of Germany. It was\r\nnot, however, at Frankfort or at the minor capitals that the conflict\r\nbetween authority and its antagonists was to be decided. Vienna, the\r\nstronghold of absolutism, the sanctuary from which so many interdicts had\r\ngone forth against freedom in every part of Europe, was itself invaded by\r\nthe revolutionary spirit. The clear sky darkened, and Metternich found\r\nhimself powerless before the storm.\r\n\r\n[Austria.]\r\n\r\nThere had been until 1848 so complete an absence of political life in the\r\nAustrian capital, that, when the conviction suddenly burst upon all minds\r\nthat the ancient order was doomed, there were neither party-leaders to\r\nconfront the Government, nor plans of reform upon which any considerable\r\nbody of men were agreed. The first utterances of public discontent were\r\npetitions drawn up by the Chamber of Commerce and by literary associations.\r\nThese were vague in purport and far from aggressive in their tone. A\r\nsterner note sounded when intelligence reached the capital of the\r\nresolutions that had been passed by the Hungarian Lower House on the 3rd of\r\nMarch, and of the language in which these had been enforced by Kossuth.\r\nCasting aside all reserve, the Magyar leader had declared that the reigning\r\ndynasty could only be saved by granting to Hungary a responsible Ministry\r\ndrawn from the Diet itself, and by establishing constitutional government\r\nthroughout the Austrian dominions. \"From the charnel-house of the Viennese\r\nsystem,\" he cried, \"a poison-laden atmosphere steals over us, which\r\nparalyses our nerves and bows us when we would soar. The future of Hungary\r\ncan never be secure while in the other provinces there exists a system of\r\ngovernment in direct antagonism to every constitutional principle. Our task\r\nit is to found a happier future on the brotherhood of all the Austrian\r\nraces, and to substitute for the union enforced by bayonets and police the\r\nenduring bond of a free constitution.\" When the Hungarian Assembly had thus\r\ntaken into its own hands the cause of the rest of the monarchy, it was not\r\nfor the citizens of Vienna to fall short in the extent of their demands.\r\nThe idea of a Constitution for the Empire at large was generally accepted\r\nand it was proposed that an address embodying this demand should be sent in\r\nto the Emperor by the Provincial Estates of Lower Austria, whose meeting\r\nhappened to be fixed for the 13th of March. In the meantime the students\r\nmade themselves the heroes of the hour. The agitation of the city\r\nincreased; rumours of State bankruptcy and of the impending repudiation of\r\nthe paper currency filled all classes with the belief that some catastrophe\r\nwas near at hand. [411]\r\n\r\n[The March Revolution at Vienna.]\r\n\r\nThe Provincial Estates of Lower Austria had long fallen into such\r\ninsignificance that in ordinary times their proceedings were hardly noticed\r\nby the capital. The accident that they were now to assemble in the midst of\r\na great crisis elevated them to a sudden importance. It was believed that\r\nthe decisive word would be spoken in the course of their debates; and on\r\nthe morning of the 13th of March masses of the populace, led by a\r\nprocession of students, assembled round the Hall of the Diet. While the\r\ndebate proceeded within, street-orators inflamed the passions of the crowd\r\noutside. The tumult deepened; and when at length a note was let down from\r\none of the windows of the Hall stating that the Diet were inclining to\r\nhalf-measures, the mob broke into uproar, and an attack was made upon the\r\nDiet Hall itself. The leading members of the Estates were compelled to\r\nplace themselves at the head of a deputation, which proceeded to the\r\nEmperor's palace in order to enforce the demands of the people. The Emperor\r\nhimself, who at no time was capable of paying serious attention to\r\nbusiness, remained invisible during this and the two following days; the\r\ndeputation was received by Metternich and the principal officers of State,\r\nwho were assembled in council. Meanwhile the crowds in the streets became\r\ndenser and more excited; soldiers approached, to protect the Diet Hall and\r\nto guard the environs of the palace; there was an interval of confusion;\r\nand on the advance of a new regiment, which was mistaken for an attack, the\r\nmob who had stormed the Diet Hall hurled the shattered furniture from the\r\nwindows upon the soldiers' heads. A volley was now fired, which cost\r\nseveral lives. At the sound of the firing still deeper agitation seized the\r\ncity. Barricades were erected, and the people and soldiers fought hand to\r\nhand. As evening came on, deputation after deputation pressed into the\r\npalace to urge concession upon the Government. Metternich, who, almost\r\nalone in the Council, had made light of the popular uprising, now at length\r\nconsented to certain definite measures of reform. He retired into an\r\nadjoining room to draft an order abolishing the censorship of the Press.\r\nDuring his absence the cry was raised among the deputations that thronged\r\nthe Council-chamber, \"Down with Metternich!\" The old man returned, and\r\nfound himself abandoned by his colleagues. There were some among them,\r\nmembers of the Imperial family, who had long been his opponents; others who\r\nhad in vain urged him to make concessions before it was too late.\r\nMetternich saw that the end of his career was come; he spoke a few words,\r\nmarked by all the dignity and self-possession of his greatest days, and\r\nwithdrew, to place his resignation in the Emperor's hands.\r\n\r\n[Flight of Metternich.]\r\n\r\nFor thirty-nine years Metternich had been so completely identified with the\r\nAustrian system of government that in his fall that entire system seemed to\r\nhave vanished away. The tumult of the capital subsided on the mere\r\nannouncement of his resignation, though the hatred which he had excited\r\nrendered it unsafe for him to remain within reach of hostile hands. He was\r\nconveyed from Vienna by a faithful secretary on the night of the 14th of\r\nMarch, and, after remaining for a few days in concealment, crossed the\r\nSaxon frontier. His exile was destined to be of some duration, but no exile\r\nwas ever more cheerfully borne, or sweetened by a profounder satisfaction\r\nat the evils which a mad world had brought upon itself by driving from it\r\nits one thoroughly wise and just statesman. Betaking himself in the general\r\ncrash of the Continental Courts to Great Britain, which was still as safe\r\nas when he had visited it fifty-five years before, Metternich received a\r\nkindly welcome from the Duke of Wellington and the leaders of English\r\nsociety; and when the London season was over he sought and found at\r\nBrighton something of the liveliness and the sunshine of his own southern\r\nhome. [412]\r\n\r\n[The Hungarian Diet.]\r\n\r\nThe action of the Hungarian Diet under Kossuth's leadership had powerfully\r\ninfluenced the course of events at Vienna. The Viennese outbreak in its\r\nturn gave irresistible force to the Hungarian national movement. Up to the\r\n13th of March the Chamber of Magnates had withheld their assent from the\r\nresolution passed by the Lower House in favour of a national executive;\r\nthey now accepted it without a single hostile vote; and on the 15th a\r\ndeputation was sent to Vienna to lay before the Emperor an address\r\ndemanding not only the establishment of a responsible Ministry but the\r\nfreedom of the Press, trial by jury, equality of religion, and a system of\r\nnational education. At the moment when this deputation reached Vienna the\r\nGovernment was formally announcing its compliance with the popular demand\r\nfor a Constitution for the whole of the Empire. The Hungarians were\r\nescorted in triumph through the streets, and were received on the following\r\nday by the Emperor himself, who expressed a general concurrence with the\r\nterms of the address. The deputation returned to Presburg, and the\r\nPalatine, or representative of the sovereign in Hungary, the Archduke\r\nStephen, forthwith charged Count Batthyány, one of the most popular of the\r\nMagyar nobles, with the formation of a national Ministry. Thus far the Diet\r\nhad been in the van of the Hungarian movement; it now sank almost into\r\ninsignificance by the side of the revolutionary organisation at Pesth,\r\nwhere all the ardour and all the patriotism of the Magyar race glowed in\r\ntheir native force untempered by the political experience of the statesmen\r\nwho were collected at Presburg, and unchecked by any of those influences\r\nwhich belong to the neighbourhood of an Imperial Court. At Pesth there\r\nbroke out an agitation at once so democratic and so intensely national that\r\nall considerations of policy and of regard for the Austrian Government\r\nwhich might have affected the action of the Diet were swept away before it.\r\nKossuth, himself the genuine representative of the capital, became supreme.\r\nAt his bidding the Diet passed a law abolishing the departments of the\r\nCentral Government by which the control of the Court over the Hungarian\r\nbody politic had been exercised. A list of Ministers was submitted and\r\napproved, including not only those who were needed for the transaction of\r\ndomestic business, but Ministers of War, Finance, and Foreign Affairs; and\r\nin order that the entire nation might rally round its Government, the\r\npeasantry were at one stroke emancipated from all services attaching to the\r\nland, and converted into free proprietors. Of the compensation to be paid\r\nto the lords for the loss of these services, no more was said than that it\r\nwas a debt of honour to be discharged by the nation.\r\n\r\n[Hungary wins independence.]\r\n\r\nWithin the next few days the measures thus carried through the Diet by\r\nKossuth were presented for the Emperor's ratification at Vienna. The fall\r\nof Metternich, important as it was, had not in reality produced that effect\r\nupon the Austrian Government which was expected from it by popular opinion.\r\nThe new Cabinet at Vienna was drawn from the ranks of the official\r\nhierarchy; and although some of its members were more liberally disposed\r\nthan their late chief, they had all alike passed their lives in the\r\ntraditions of the ancient system, and were far from intending to make\r\nthemselves the willing agents of revolution. These men saw clearly enough\r\nthat the action of the Diet at Presburg amounted to nothing less than the\r\nseparation of Hungary from the Austrian Empire. With the Ministries of War,\r\nFinance, and Foreign Affairs established in independence of the central\r\ngovernment, there would remain no link between Hungary and the Hereditary\r\nStates but the person of a titular, and, for the present time, an imbecile\r\nsovereign. Powerless and distracted, Metternich's successors looked in all\r\ndirections for counsel. The Palatine argued that three courses were open to\r\nthe Austrian Government. It might endeavour to crush the Hungarian movement\r\nby force of arms; for this purpose, however, the troops available were\r\ninsufficient: or it might withdraw from the country altogether, leaving the\r\npeasants to attack the nobles, as they had done in Galicia; this was a\r\ndishonourable policy, and the action of the Diet had, moreover, secured to\r\nthe peasant everything that he could gain by a social insurrection: or\r\nfinally, the Government might yield for the moment to the inevitable, make\r\nterms with Batthyány's Ministry, and quietly prepare for vigorous\r\nresistance when opportunity should arrive. The last method was that which\r\nthe Palatine recommended; the Court inclined in the same direction, but it\r\nwas unwilling to submit without making some further trial of the temper of\r\nits antagonists. A rescript was accordingly sent to Presburg, announcing\r\nthat the Ministry formed by Count Batthyány was accepted by the Emperor,\r\nbut that the central offices which the Diet had abolished must be\r\npreserved, and the functions of the Ministers of War and Finance be reduced\r\nto those of chiefs of departments, dependent on the orders of a higher\r\nauthority at Vienna. From the delay that had taken place in the despatch of\r\nthis answer the nationalist leaders at Pesth and at Presburg had augured no\r\ngood result. Its publication brought the country to the verge of armed\r\nrevolt. Batthyány refused to accept office under the conditions named; the\r\nPalatine himself declared that he could remain in Hungary no longer.\r\nTerrified at the result of its own challenge, the Court now withdrew from\r\nthe position that it had taken up, and accepted the scheme of the Diet in\r\nits integrity, stipulating only that the disposal of the army outside\r\nHungary in time of war, and the appointment to the higher commands, should\r\nremain with the Imperial Government. [413]\r\n\r\n[Bohemian movement.]\r\n\r\n[Autonomy promised.]\r\n\r\nHungary had thus made good its position as an independent State connected\r\nwith Austria only through the person of its monarch. Vast and momentous as\r\nwas the change, fatal as it might well appear to those who could conceive\r\nof no unity but the unity of a central government, the victory of the\r\nMagyars appears to have excited no feeling among the German Liberals at\r\nVienna but one of satisfaction. So odious, so detested, was the fallen\r\nsystem of despotism, that every victory won by its adversaries was hailed\r\nas a triumph of the good cause, be the remoter issues what they might. Even\r\nwhere a powerful German element, such as did not exist in Hungary itself,\r\nwas threatened by the assertion of provincial claims, the Government could\r\nnot hope for the support of the capital if it should offer resistance. The\r\nexample of the Magyars was speedily followed by the Czechs in Bohemia.\r\nForgotten and obliterated among the nationalities of Europe, the Czechs had\r\npreserved in their language, and in that almost alone, the emblem of their\r\nnational independence. Within the borders of Bohemia there was so large a\r\nGerman population that the ultimate absorption of the Slavic element by\r\nthis wealthier and privileged body had at an earlier time seemed not\r\nunlikely. Since 1830, however, the Czech national movement had been\r\ngradually gaining ground. In the first days of the agitation of 1848 an\r\neffort had been made to impress a purely constitutional form upon the\r\ndemands made in the name of the people of Prague, and so to render the\r\nunion of all classes possible. This policy, however, received its deathblow\r\nfrom the Revolution in Vienna and from the victory of the Magyars. The\r\nleadership at Prague passed from men of position and experience,\r\nrepresenting rather the intelligence of the German element in Bohemia than\r\nthe patriotism of the Czechs, to the nationalist orators who commanded the\r\nstreets. An attempt made by the Cabinet at Vienna to evade the demands\r\ndrawn up under the influence of the more moderate politicians resulted only\r\nin the downfall of this party, and in the tender of a new series of demands\r\nof far more revolutionary character. The population of Prague were\r\nbeginning to organise a national guard; arms were being distributed;\r\nauthority had collapsed. The Government was now forced to consent to\r\neverything that was asked of it, and a legislative Assembly with an\r\nindependent local administration was promised to Bohemia. To this Assembly,\r\nas soon as it should meet, the new institutions of the kingdom were to be\r\nsubmitted.\r\n\r\n[Insurrection of Lombardy, March 18.]\r\n\r\nThus far, if the authority of the Court of Vienna, had been virtually\r\nshaken off by a great part of its subjects, the Emperor had at least not\r\nseen these subjects in avowed rebellion against the House of Hapsburg, nor\r\nsupported in their resistance by the arms of a foreign Power. South of the\r\nAlps the dynastic connection was openly severed, and the rule of Austria\r\ndeclared for ever at an end. Lombardy had since the beginning of the year\r\n1848 been held in check only by the display of great military force. The\r\nRevolution at Paris had excited both hopes and fears; the Revolution at\r\nVienna was instantly followed by revolt in Milan. Radetzky, the Austrian\r\ncommander, a veteran who had served with honour in every campaign since\r\nthat against the Turks in 1788, had long foreseen the approach of an armed\r\nconflict; yet when the actual crisis arrived his dispositions had not been\r\nmade for meeting it. The troops in Milan were ill placed; the offices of\r\nGovernment were moreover separated by half the breadth of the city from the\r\nmilitary head-quarters. Thus when on the 18th of March the insurrection\r\nbroke out, it carried everything before it. The Vice-Governor, O'Donell,\r\nwas captured, and compelled to sign his name to decrees handing over the\r\ngovernment of the city to the Municipal Council. Radetzky now threw his\r\nsoldiers upon the barricades, and penetrated to the centre of the city; but\r\nhe was unable to maintain himself there under the ceaseless fire from the\r\nwindows and the housetops, and withdrew on the night of the 19th to the\r\nline of fortifications. Fighting continued during the next two days in the\r\noutskirts and at the gates of the city. The garrisons of all the\r\nneighbouring towns were summoned to the assistance of their general, but\r\nthe Italians broke up the bridges and roads, and one detachment alone out\r\nof all the troops in Lombardy succeeded in reaching Milan. A report now\r\narrived at Radetzky's camp that the King of Piedmont was on the march\r\nagainst him. Preferring the loss of Milan to the possible capture of his\r\narmy, he determined to evacuate the city. On the night of the 22nd of March\r\nthe retreat was begun, and Radetzky fell back upon the Mincio and Verona,\r\nwhich he himself had made the centre of the Austrian system of defence in\r\nUpper Italy. [414]\r\n\r\n[Insurrection of Venice.]\r\n\r\n[Piedmont makes war.]\r\n\r\nVenice had already followed the example of the Lombard capital. The tidings\r\nreceived from Vienna after the 13th of March appear to have completely\r\nbewildered both the military and the civil authorities on the Adriatic\r\ncoast. They released their political prisoners, among whom was Daniel\r\nManin, an able and determined foe of Austria; they entered into\r\nconstitutional discussions with the popular leaders; they permitted the\r\nformation of a national guard, and finally handed over to this guard the\r\narsenals and the dockyards with all their stores. From this time all was\r\nover. Manin proclaimed the Republic of St. Mark, and became the chief of a\r\nProvisional Government. The Italian regiments in garrison joined the\r\nnational cause; the ships of war at Pola, manned chiefly by Italian\r\nsailors, were only prevented from sailing to the assistance of the rebels\r\nby batteries that were levelled against them from the shore. Thus without a\r\nblow being struck Venice was lost to Austria. The insurrection spread\r\nwestwards and northwards through city and village in the interior, till\r\nthere remained to Austria nothing but the fortresses on the Adige and the\r\nMincio, where Radetzky, deaf to the counsels of timidity, held his ground\r\nunshaken. The national rising carried Piedmont with it. It was in vain that\r\nthe British envoy at Turin urged the King to enter into no conflict with\r\nAustria. On the 24th of March Charles Albert published a proclamation\r\npromising his help to the Lombards. Two days later his troops entered\r\nMilan. [415]\r\n\r\n[General war against Austria, beginning in Italy.]\r\n\r\nAustria had for thirty years consistently laid down the principle that its\r\nown sovereignty in Upper Italy vested it with the right to control the\r\npolitical system of every other State in the peninsula. It had twice\r\nenforced this principle by arms: first in its intervention in Naples in\r\n1820, afterwards in its occupation of the Roman States in 1831. The\r\nGovernment of Vienna had, as it were with fixed intention, made it\r\nimpossible that its presence in any part of Italy should be regarded as the\r\npresence of an ordinary neighbour, entitled to quiet possession until some\r\nnew provocation should be given. The Italians would have proved themselves\r\nthe simplest of mankind if, having any reasonable hope of military success,\r\nthey had listened to the counsels of Palmerston and other statesmen who\r\nurged them not to take advantage of the difficulties in which Austria was\r\nnow placed. The paralysis of the Austrian State was indeed the one\r\nunanswerable argument for immediate war. So long as the Emperor retained\r\nhis ascendency in any part of Italy, his interests could not permanently\r\nsuffer the independence of the rest. If the Italians should chivalrously\r\nwait until the Cabinet of Vienna had recovered its strength, it was quite\r\ncertain that their next efforts in the cause of internal liberty would be\r\nas ruthlessly crushed as their last. Every clearsighted patriot understood\r\nthat the time for a great national effort had arrived. In some respects the\r\npolitical condition of Italy seemed favourable to such united action. Since\r\nthe insurrection of Palermo in January, 1848, absolutism had everywhere\r\nfallen. Ministries had come into existence containing at least a fair\r\nproportion of men who were in real sympathy with the national feeling.\r\nAbove all, the Pope seemed disposed to place himself at the head of a\r\npatriotic union against the foreigner. Thus, whatever might be the secret\r\ninclinations of the reigning Houses, they were unable for the moment to\r\nresist the call to arms. Without an actual declaration of war troops were\r\nsent northwards from Naples, from Florence, and from Rome, to take part, as\r\nit was supposed, in the national struggle by the side of the King of\r\nPiedmont. Volunteers thronged to the standards. The Papal benediction\r\nseemed for once to rest on the cause of manhood and independence. On the\r\nother hand, the very impetus which had brought Liberal Ministries into\r\npower threatened to pass into a phase of violence and disorder. The\r\nconcessions already made were mocked by men who expected to win all the\r\nvictories of democracy in an hour. It remained to be seen whether there\r\nexisted in Italy the political sagacity which, triumphing over all local\r\njealousies, could bend to one great aim the passions of the multitude and\r\nthe fears of the Courts, or whether the cause of the whole nation would be\r\nwrecked in an ignoble strife between demagogues and reactionists, between\r\nthe rabble of the street and the camarilla round the throne. [416]\r\n\r\n[The March Days at Berlin.]\r\n\r\nAustria had with one hand held down Italy, with the other it had weighed on\r\nGermany. Though the Revolutionary movement was in full course on the east\r\nof the Rhine before Metternich's fall, it received, especially at Berlin, a\r\ngreat impetus from this event. Since the beginning of March the Prussian\r\ncapital had worn an unwonted aspect. In this city of military discipline\r\npublic meetings had been held day after day, and the streets had been\r\nblocked by excited crowds. Deputations which laid before the King demands\r\nsimilar to those now made in every German town received halting and evasive\r\nanswers. Excitement increased, and on the 13th of March encounters began\r\nbetween the citizens and the troops, which, though insignificant, served to\r\nexasperate the people and its leaders. The King appeared to be wavering\r\nbetween resistance and concession until the Revolution at Vienna, which\r\nbecame known at Berlin on the 15th of March, brought affairs to their\r\ncrisis. On the 17th the tumult in the streets suddenly ceased; it was\r\nunderstood that the following day would see the Government either\r\nreconciled with the people or forced to deal with an insurrection on a\r\ngreat scale. Accordingly on the morning of the 18th crowds made their way\r\ntowards the palace, which was surrounded by troops. About midday there\r\nappeared a Royal edict summoning the Prussian United Diet for the 2nd of\r\nApril, and announcing that the King had determined to promote the creation\r\nof a Parliament for all Germany and the establishment of Constitutional\r\nGovernment in every German State. This manifesto drew fresh masses towards\r\nthe palace, desirous, it would seem, to express their satisfaction; its\r\ncontents, however, were imperfectly understood by the assembly already in\r\nfront of the palace, which the King vainly attempted to address. When\r\ncalled upon to disperse, the multitude refused to do so, and answered by\r\ncries for the withdrawal of the soldiery. In the midst of the confusion two\r\nshots were fired from the ranks without orders; a panic followed, in which,\r\nfor no known reason, the cavalry and infantry threw themselves upon the\r\npeople. The crowd was immediately put to flight, but the combat was taken\r\nup by the population of Berlin. Barricades appeared in the streets;\r\nfighting continued during the evening and night. Meanwhile the King, who\r\nwas shocked and distressed at the course that events had taken, received\r\ndeputations begging that the troops might be withdrawn from the city.\r\nFrederick William endeavoured for awhile to make the surrender of the\r\nbarricades the condition for an armistice; but as night went on the troops\r\nbecame exhausted, and although they had gained ground, the resistance of\r\nthe people was not overcome. Whether doubtful of the ultimate issue of the\r\nconflict or unwilling to permit further bloodshed, the King gave way, and\r\nat daybreak on the 19th ordered the troops to be withdrawn. His intention\r\nwas that they should continue to garrison the palace, but the order was\r\nmisunderstood, and the troops were removed to the outside of Berlin. The\r\npalace was thus left unprotected, and, although no injury was inflicted\r\nupon its inmates, the King was made to feel that the people could now\r\ncommand his homage. The bodies of the dead were brought into the court of\r\nthe palace; their wounds were laid bare, and the King, who appeared in a\r\nbalcony, was compelled to descend into the court, and to stand before them\r\nwith uncovered head. Definite political expression was given to the changed\r\nstate of affairs by the appointment of a new Ministry. [417]\r\n\r\nThe conflict between the troops and the people at Berlin was described, and\r\nwith truth, as the result of a misunderstanding. Frederick William had\r\nalready determined to yield to the principal demands of his subjects; nor\r\non the part of the inhabitants of Berlin had there existed any general\r\nhostility towards the sovereign, although a small group of agitators, in\r\npart foreign, had probably sought to bring about an armed attack on the\r\nthrone. Accordingly, when once the combat was broken off, there seemed to\r\nbe no important obstacle to a reconciliation between the King and the\r\npeople. Frederick William chose a course which spared and even gratified\r\nhis own self-love. In the political faith of all German Liberals the\r\nestablishment of German unity was now an even more important article than\r\nthe introduction of free institutions into each particular State. The\r\nRevolution at Berlin had indeed been occasioned by the King's delay in\r\ngranting internal reform; but these domestic disputes might well be\r\nforgotten if in the great cause of German unity the Prussians saw their\r\nKing rising to the needs of the hour. Accordingly the first resolution of\r\nFrederick William, after quiet had returned to the capital, was to appear\r\nin public state as the champion of the Fatherland. A proclamation announced\r\non the morning of the 21st of March that the King had placed himself at the\r\nhead of the German nation, and that he would on that day appear on\r\nhorseback wearing the old German colours. In due time Frederick William\r\ncame forth at the head of a procession, wearing the tricolor of gold,\r\nwhite, and black, which since 1815 had been so dear to the patriots and so\r\nodious to the Governments of Germany. As he passed through the streets he\r\nwas saluted as Emperor, but he repudiated the title, asserting with oaths\r\nand imprecations that he intended to rob no German prince of his\r\nsovereignty. At each stage of his theatrical progress he repeated to\r\nappropriate auditors his sounding but ambiguous allusions to the duties\r\nimposed upon him by the common danger. A manifesto, published at the close\r\nof the day, summed up the utterances of the monarch in a somewhat less\r\nrhetorical form. \"Germany is in ferment within, and exposed from without to\r\ndanger from more than one side. Deliverance from this danger can come only\r\nfrom the most intimate union of the German princes and people under a\r\nsingle leadership. I take this leadership upon me for the hour of peril. I\r\nhave to-day assumed the old German colours, and placed myself and my people\r\nunder the venerable banner of the German Empire. Prussia henceforth is\r\nmerged in Germany.\" [418]\r\n\r\n[National Assembly promised.]\r\n\r\nThe ride of the King through Berlin, and his assumption of the character of\r\nGerman leader, however little it pleased the minor sovereigns, or gratified\r\nthe Liberals of the smaller States, who considered that such National\r\nauthority ought to be conferred by the nation, not assumed by a prince, was\r\nsuccessful for the moment in restoring to the King some popularity among\r\nhis own subjects. He could now without humiliation proceed with the\r\nconcessions which had been interrupted by the tragical events of the 18th\r\nof March. In answer to a deputation from Breslau, which urged that the\r\nChamber formed by the union of the Provincial Diets should be replaced by a\r\nConstituent Assembly, the King promised that a national Representative\r\nAssembly should be convoked as soon as the United Diet had passed the\r\nnecessary electoral law. To this National Assembly the Government would\r\nsubmit measures securing the liberty of the individual, the right of public\r\nmeeting and of associations, trial by jury, the responsibility of\r\nMinisters, and the independence of the judicature. A civic militia was to\r\nbe formed, with the right of choosing its own officers, and the standing\r\narmy was to take the oath of allegiance to the Constitution. Hereditary\r\njurisdictions and manorial rights of police were to be abolished; equality\r\nbefore the law was to be universally enforced; in short, the entire scheme\r\nof reforms demanded by the Constitutional Liberals of Prussia was to be\r\ncarried into effect. In Berlin, as in every other capital in Germany, the\r\nvictory of the party of progress now seemed to be assured. The Government\r\nno longer represented a power hostile to popular rights; and when, on the\r\n22nd of March, the King spontaneously paid the last honours to those who\r\nhad fallen in combat with his troops, as the long funeral procession passed\r\nhis palace, it was generally believed that his expression of feeling was\r\nsincere.\r\n\r\n[Schleswig-Holstein.]\r\n\r\nIn the passage of his address in which King Frederick William spoke of the\r\nexternal dangers threatening Germany, he referred to apprehensions which\r\nhad for a while been current that the second French Republic would revive\r\nthe aggressive energy of the first. This fear proved baseless;\r\nnevertheless, for a sovereign who really intended to act as the champion of\r\nthe German nation at large, the probability of war with a neighbouring\r\nPower was far from remote. The cause of the Duchies of Schleswig-Holstein,\r\nwhich were in rebellion against the Danish Crown, excited the utmost\r\ninterest and sympathy in Germany. The population of these provinces, with\r\nthe exception of certain districts in Schleswig, was German; Holstein was\r\nactually a member of the German Federation. The legal relation of the\r\nDuchies to Denmark was, according to the popular view, very nearly that of\r\nHanover to England before 1837. The King of Denmark was also Duke of\r\nSchleswig and of Holstein, but these were no more an integral portion of\r\nthe Danish State than Hanover was of the British Empire; and the laws of\r\nsuccession were moreover different in Schleswig-Holstein, the Crown being\r\ntransmitted by males, while in Denmark females were capable of succession.\r\nOn the part of the Danes it was admitted that in certain districts in\r\nHolstein the Salic law held good; it was, however, maintained that in the\r\nremainder of Holstein and in all Schleswig the rules of succession were the\r\nsame as in Denmark. The Danish Government denied that Schleswig-Holstein\r\nformed a unity in itself, as alleged by the Germans, and that it possessed\r\nseparate national rights as against the authority of the King's Government\r\nat Copenhagen. The real heart of the difficulty lay in the fact that the\r\npopulation of the Duchies was German. So long as the Germans as a race\r\npossessed no national feeling, the union of the Duchies with the Danish\r\nMonarchy had not been felt as a grievance. It happened, however, that the\r\ngreat revival of German patriotism resulting from the War of Liberation in\r\n1813 was almost simultaneous with the severance of Norway from the Danish\r\nCrown, which compelled the Government of Copenhagen to increase very\r\nheavily the burdens imposed on its German subjects in the Duchies. From\r\nthis time discontent gained ground, especially in Altona and Kiel, where\r\nsociety was as thoroughly German as in the neighbouring city of Hamburg.\r\nAfter 1830, when Provincial Estates were established in Schleswig and\r\nHolstein, the German movement became formidable. The reaction, however,\r\nwhich marked the succeeding period generally in Europe prevailed in Denmark\r\ntoo, and it was not until 1844, when a posthumous work of Lornsen, the\r\nexiled leader of the German party, vindicated the historical rights of the\r\nDuchies, that the claims of German nationality in these provinces were\r\nagain vigorously urged. From this time the separation of Schleswig-Holstein\r\nfrom Denmark became a question of practical politics. The King of Denmark,\r\nChristain VIII., had but one son, who, though long married, was childless,\r\nand with whom the male line of the reigning House would expire. In answer\r\nto an address of the Danish Provincial Estates calling upon the King to\r\ndeclare the unity of the Monarchy and the validity of the Danish law of\r\nsuccession for all its parts, the Holstein Estates passed a resolution in\r\nNovember, 1844, that the Duchies were an independent body, governed by the\r\nrule of male descent, and indivisible. After an interval of two years,\r\nduring which a Commission examined the succession-laws, King Christian\r\npublished a declaration that the succession was the same in Schleswig as in\r\nDenmark proper, and that, as regarded those parts of Holstein where a\r\ndifferent rule of succession existed, he would spare no effort to maintain\r\nthe unity of the Monarchy. On this the Provincial Estates both of Schleswig\r\nand of Holstein addressed protests to the King, who refused to accept them.\r\nThe deputies now resigned in a mass, whilst on behalf of Holstein an appeal\r\nwas made to the German Federal Diet. The Diet merely replied by a\r\ndeclaration of rights; but in Germany at large the keenest interest was\r\naroused on behalf of these severed members of the race who were so\r\nresolutely struggling against incorporation with a foreign Power. The\r\ndeputies themselves, passing from village to village, excited a strenuous\r\nspirit of resistance throughout the Duchies, which was met by the Danish\r\nGovernment with measures of repression more severe than any which it had\r\nhitherto employed. [419]\r\n\r\n[Insurrection in Holstein, March 24.]\r\n\r\n[War between Germany and Denmark.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation of affairs when, on the 20th of January, 1848, King\r\nChristian VIII. died, leaving the throne to Frederick VII., the last of the\r\nmale line of his House. Frederick's first act was to publish the draft of a\r\nConstitution, in which all parts of the Monarchy were treated as on the\r\nsame footing. Before the delegates could assemble to whom the completion of\r\nthis work was referred, the shock of the Paris Revolution reached the North\r\nSea ports. A public meeting at Altona demanded the establishment of a\r\nseparate constitution for Schleswig-Holstein, and the admission of\r\nSchleswig into the German Federation. The Provincial Estates accepted this\r\nresolution, and sent a deputation to Copenhagen to present this and other\r\ndemands to the King. But in the course of the next few days a popular\r\nmovement at Copenhagen brought into power a thoroughly Danish Ministry,\r\npledged to the incorporation of Schleswig with Denmark as an integral part\r\nof the Kingdom. Without waiting to learn the answer made by the King to the\r\ndeputation, the Holsteiners now took affairs into their own hands. A\r\nProvisional Government was formed at Kiel (March 24), the troops joined the\r\npeople, and the insurrection instantly spread over the whole province. As\r\nthe proposal to change the law of succession to the throne had originated\r\nwith the King of Denmark, the cause of the Holsteiners was from one point\r\nof view that of established right. The King of Prussia, accepting the\r\npositions laid down by the Holstein Estates in 1844, declared that he would\r\ndefend the claims of the legitimate heir by force of arms, and ordered his\r\ntroops to enter Holstein. The Diet of Frankfort, now forced to express the\r\nuniversal will of Germany, demanded that Schleswig, as the sister State of\r\nHolstein, should enter the Federation. On the passing of this resolution,\r\nthe envoy who represented the Denmark. King of Denmark at the Diet, as Duke\r\nof Holstein, quitted Frankfort, and a state of war ensued between Denmark\r\non the one side and Prussia with the German Federation on the other.\r\n\r\n[The German Ante-Parliament, March 30-April 4.]\r\n\r\n[Republican rising in Baden.]\r\n\r\nThe passionate impulse of the German people towards unity had already\r\ncalled into being an organ for the expression of national sentiment, which,\r\nif without any legal or constitutional authority, was yet strong enough to\r\nimpose its will upon the old and discredited Federal Diet and upon most of\r\nthe surviving Governments. At the invitation of a Committee, about five\r\nhundred Liberals who had in one form or another taken part in public\r\naffairs assembled at Frankfort on the 30th of March to make the necessary\r\npreparations for the meeting of a German national Parliament. This\r\nAssembly, which is known as the Ante-Parliament, sat but for five days. Its\r\nresolutions, so far as regarded the method of electing the new Parliament,\r\nand the inclusion of new districts in the German Federation, were accepted\r\nby the Diet, and in the main carried into effect. Its denunciation of\r\npersons concerned in the repressive measures of 1819 and subsequent\r\nreactionary epochs was followed by the immediate retirement of all members\r\nof the Diet whose careers dated back to those detested days. But in the\r\nmost important work that was expected from the Ante-Parliament, the\r\nsettlement of a draft-Constitution to be laid before the future National\r\nAssembly as a basis for its deliberations, nothing whatever was\r\naccomplished. The debates that took place from the 31st of March to the 4th\r\nof April were little more than a trial of strength between the Monarchical\r\nand Republican parties. The Republicans, far outnumbered when they\r\nsubmitted a constitutional scheme of their own, proposed, after this\r\nrepulse, that the existing Assembly should continue in session until the\r\nNational Parliament met; in other words, that it should take upon itself\r\nthe functions and character of a National Convention. Defeated also on this\r\nproposal, the leaders of the extreme section of the Republican party,\r\nstrangely miscalculating their real strength, determined on armed\r\ninsurrection. Uniting with a body of German refugees beyond the Rhine, who\r\nwere themselves assisted by French and Polish soldiers of revolution, they\r\nraised the Republican standard in Baden, and for a few days maintained a\r\nhopeless and inglorious struggle against the troops which were sent to\r\nsuppress them. Even in Baden, which had long been in advance of all other\r\nGerman States in democratic sentiment, and which was peculiarly open to\r\nRepublican influences from France and Switzerland, the movement was not\r\nseriously supported by the population, and in the remainder of Germany it\r\nreceived no countenance whatever. The leaders found themselves ruined men.\r\nThe best of them fled to the United States, where, in the great struggle\r\nagainst slavery thirteen years later, they rendered better service to their\r\nadopted than they had ever rendered to their natural Fatherland.\r\n\r\n[Meeting of the German National Assembly, May 18.]\r\n\r\nOn breaking up on the 4th of April, the Ante-Parliament left behind it a\r\nCommittee of Fifty, whose task it was to continue the work of preparation\r\nfor the National Assembly to which it had itself contributed so little. One\r\nthing alone had been clearly established, that the future Constitution of\r\nGermany was not to be Republican. That the existing Governments could not\r\nbe safely ignored by the National Assembly in its work of founding the new\r\nFederal Constitution for Germany was clear to those who were not blinded by\r\nthe enthusiasm of the moment. In the Committee of Fifty and elsewhere plans\r\nwere suggested for giving to the Governments a representation within the\r\nConstituent Assembly, or for uniting their representatives in a Chamber\r\nco-ordinate with this, so that each step in the construction of the new\r\nFederal order should be at once the work of the nation and of the\r\nGovernments. Such plans were suggested and discussed; but in the haste and\r\ninexperience of the time they were brought to no conclusion. The opening of\r\nthe National Assembly had been fixed for the 18th of May, and this brief\r\ninterval had expired before the few sagacious men who understood the\r\nnecessity of co-operation between the Governments and the Parliament had\r\ndecided upon any common course of action. To the mass of patriots it was\r\nenough that Germany, after thirty years of disappointment, had at last won\r\nits national representation. Before this imposing image of the united race,\r\nKings, Courts, and armies, it was fondly thought, must bow. Thus, in the\r\nmidst of universal hope, the elections were held throughout Germany in its\r\nutmost federal extent, from the Baltic to the Italian border; Bohemia\r\nalone, where the Czech majority resisted any closer union with Germany,\r\ndeclining to send representatives to Frankfort. In the body of deputies\r\nelected there were to be found almost all the foremost Liberal politicians\r\nof every German community; a few still vigorous champions of the time of\r\nthe War of Liberation, chief among them the poet Arndt; patriots who in the\r\nevil days that followed had suffered imprisonment and exile; historians,\r\nprofessors, critics, who in the sacred cause of liberty have, like\r\nGervinus, inflicted upon their readers worse miseries than ever they\r\nthemselves endured at the hands of unregenerate kings; theologians,\r\njournalists; in short, the whole group of leaders under whom Germany\r\nexpected to enter into the promised land of national unity and freedom. No\r\nImperial coronation ever brought to Frankfort so many honoured guests, or\r\nattracted to the same degree the sympathy of the German race. Greeted with\r\nthe cheers of the citizens of Frankfort, whose civic militia lined the\r\nstreets, the members of the Assembly marched in procession on the afternoon\r\nof the 18th of May from the ancient banqueting-hall of the Kaisers, where\r\nthey had gathered, to the Church of St. Paul, which had been chosen as\r\ntheir Senate House. Their President and officers were elected on the\r\nfollowing day. Arndt, who in the frantic confusion of the first meeting had\r\nbeen unrecognised and shouted down, was called into the Tribune, but could\r\nspeak only a few words for tears. The Assembly voted him its thanks for his\r\nfamous song, \"What is the German's Fatherland?\" and requested that he would\r\nadd to it another stanza commemorating the union of the race at length\r\nvisibly realised in that great Parliament. Four days after the opening of\r\nthe General Assembly of Frankfort, the Prussian national Parliament began\r\nits sessions at Berlin. [420]\r\n\r\n[Europe generally in March, 1848.]\r\n\r\nAt this point the first act in the Revolutionary drama of 1848 in Germany,\r\nas in Europe generally, may be considered to have reached its close. A\r\ncertain unity marks the memorable epoch known generally as the March Days\r\nand the events immediately succeeding. Revolution is universal; it scarcely\r\nmeets with resistance; its views seem on the point of being achieved; the\r\nbaffled aspirations of the last half-century seem on the point of being\r\nfulfilled. There exists no longer in Central Europe such a thing as an\r\nautocratic Government; and, while the French Republic maintains an\r\nunexpected attitude of peace, Germany and Italy, under the leadership of\r\nold dynasties now penetrated with a new spirit, appear to be on the point\r\nof achieving each its own work of Federal union and of the expulsion of the\r\nforeigner from its national soil. All Italy prepares to move under Charles\r\nAlbert to force the Austrians from their last strongholds on the Mincio and\r\nthe Adige; all Germany is with the troops of Frederick William of Prussia\r\nas they enter Holstein to rescue this and the neighbouring German province\r\nfrom the Dane. In Radetzky's camp alone, and at the Court of St.\r\nPetersburg, the old monarchical order of Europe still survives. How\r\npowerful were these two isolated centres of anti-popular energy the world\r\nwas soon to see. Yet they would not have turned back the tide of European\r\naffairs and given one more victory to reaction had they not had their\r\nallies in the hatred of race to race, in the incapacity and the errors of\r\npeoples and those who represented them; above all, in the enormous\r\ndifficulties which, even had the generation been one of sages and martyrs,\r\nthe political circumstances of the time would in themselves have opposed to\r\nthe accomplishment of the ends desired.\r\n\r\n[The French Provisional Government.]\r\n\r\n[The National Workshops.]\r\n\r\nFrance had given to Central Europe the signal for the Revolution of 1848,\r\nand it was in France, where the conflict was not one for national\r\nindependence but for political and social interests, that the Revolution\r\nmost rapidly ran its course and first exhausted its powers. On the flight\r\nof Louis Philippe authority had been entrusted by the Chamber of Deputies\r\nto a Provisional Government, whose most prominent member was the orator and\r\npoet Lamartine. Installed at the Hôtel de Ville, this Government had with\r\ndifficulty prevented the mob from substituting the Red Flag for the\r\nTricolor, and from proceeding at once to realise the plans of its own\r\nleaders. The majority of the Provisional Government were Republicans of a\r\nmoderate type, representing the ideas of the urban middle classes rather\r\nthan those of the workmen; but by their side were Ledru Rollin, a\r\nrhetorician dominated by the phrases of 1793, and Louis Blanc, who\r\nconsidered all political change as but an instrument for advancing the\r\norganisation of labour and for the emancipation of the artisan from\r\nservitude, by the establishment of State-directed industries affording\r\nappropriate employment and adequate remuneration to all. Among the first\r\nproclamations of the Provisional Government was one in which, in answer to\r\na petition demanding the recognition of the Right to Labour, they undertook\r\nto guarantee employment to every citizen. This engagement, the heaviest\r\nperhaps that was ever voluntarily assumed by any Government, was followed\r\nin a few days by the opening of national workshops. That in the midst of a\r\nRevolution which took all parties by surprise plans for the conduct of a\r\nseries of industrial enterprises by the State should have been seriously\r\nexamined was impossible. The Government had paid homage to an abstract\r\nidea; they were without a conception of the mode in which it was to be\r\nrealised. What articles were to be made, what works were to be executed, no\r\none knew. The mere direction of destitute workmen to the centres where they\r\nwere to be employed was a task for which a new branch of the administration\r\nhad to be created. When this was achieved, the men collected proved useless\r\nfor all purposes of industry. Their numbers increased enormously, rising in\r\nthe course of four weeks from fourteen to sixty-five thousand. The\r\nRevolution had itself caused a financial and commercial panic, interrupting\r\nall the ordinary occupations of business, and depriving masses of men of\r\nthe means of earning a livelihood. These, with others who had no intention\r\nof working, thronged to the State workshops; while the certainty of\r\nobtaining wages from the public purse occasioned a series of strikes of\r\nworkmen against their employers and the abandonment of private factories.\r\nThe chocks which had been intended to confine enrolment at the public works\r\nto persons already domiciled in Paris completely failed; from all the\r\nneighbouring departments the idle and the hungry streamed into the capital.\r\nEvery abuse incidental to a system of public relief was present in Paris in\r\nits most exaggerated form; every element of experience, of wisdom, of\r\nprecaution, was absent. If, instead of a group of benevolent theorists, the\r\nexperiment of 1848 had had for its authors a company of millionaires\r\nanxious to dispel all hope that mankind might ever rise to a higher order\r\nthan that of unrestricted competition of man against man, it could not have\r\nbeen conducted under more fatal conditions. [421]\r\n\r\n[The Provisional Government and the Red Republicans.]\r\n\r\n[Elections, April 23.]\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the democracy in Paris had from the first considered that\r\nthe decision upon the form of Government to be established in France in\r\nplace of the Orleanist monarchy belonged rather to themselves than to the\r\nnation at large. They distrusted, and with good reason, the results of the\r\nGeneral Election which, by a decree of the Provisional Government, was to\r\nbe held in the course of April. A circular issued by Ledru Rollin, Minister\r\nof the Interior, without the knowledge of his colleagues, to the\r\nCommissioners by whom he had replaced the Prefects of the Monarchy gave the\r\nfirst open indication of this alarm, and of the means of violence and\r\nintimidation by which the party which Ledru Rollin represented hoped to\r\nimpose its will upon the country. The Commissioners were informed in plain\r\nlanguage that, as agents of a revolutionary authority, their powers were\r\nunlimited, and that their task was to exclude from election all persons who\r\nwere not animated by revolutionary spirit, and pure from any taint of\r\nassociation with the past. If the circular had been the work of the\r\nGovernment, and not of a single member of it who was at variance with most\r\nof his colleagues and whose words were far more formidable than his\r\nactions, it would have clearly foreshadowed a return to the system of 1793.\r\nBut the isolation of Ledru Rollin was well understood. The attitude of the\r\nGovernment generally was so little in accordance with the views of the Red\r\nRepublicans that on the 16th of April a demonstration was organised with\r\nthe object of compelling them to postpone the elections. The prompt\r\nappearance in arms of the National Guard, which still represented the\r\nmiddle classes of Paris, baffled the design of the leaders of the mob, and\r\ngave to Lamartine and the majority in the Government a decisive victory\r\nover their revolutionary colleague. The elections were held at the time\r\nappointed; and, in spite of the institution of universal suffrage, they\r\nresulted in the return of a body of Deputies not widely different from\r\nthose who had hitherto appeared in French Parliaments. The great majority\r\nwere indeed Republicans by profession, but of a moderate type; and the\r\nsession had no sooner opened than it became clear that the relation between\r\nthe Socialist democracy of Paris and the National Representatives could\r\nonly be one of more or less violent antagonism.\r\n\r\n[The National Assembly, May 4.]\r\n\r\n[Riot of May 15.]\r\n\r\n[Measures against the National Workshops.]\r\n\r\nThe first act of the Assembly, which met on the 4th of May, was to declare\r\nthat the Provisional Government had deserved well of the country, and to\r\nreinstate most of its members in office under the title of an Executive\r\nCommission. Ledru Rollin's offences were condoned, as those of a man\r\npopular with the democracy, and likely on the whole to yield to the\r\ninfluence of his colleagues. Louis Blanc and his confederate, Albert, as\r\nreally dangerous persons, were excluded. The Jacobin leaders now proceeded\r\nto organise an attack on the Assembly by main force. On the 15th of May the\r\nattempt was made. Under pretence of tendering a petition on behalf of\r\nPoland, a mob invaded the Legislative Chamber, declared the Assembly\r\ndissolved, and put the Deputies to flight. But the triumph was of short\r\nduration. The National Guard, whose commander alone was responsible for the\r\nfailure of measures of defence, soon rallied in force; the leaders of the\r\ninsurgents, some of whom had installed themselves as a Provisional\r\nGovernment at the Hôtel de Ville, were made captive; and after an interval\r\nof a few hours the Assembly resumed possession of the Palais Bourbon. The\r\ndishonour done to the national representation by the scandalous scenes of\r\nthe 15th of May, as well as the decisively proved superiority of the\r\nNational Guard over the half armed mob, encouraged the Assembly to declare\r\nopen war against the so-called social democracy, and to decree the\r\nabolition of the national workshops. The enormous growth of these\r\nestablishments, which now included over a hundred thousand men, threatened\r\nto ruin the public finances; the demoralisation which they engendered\r\nseemed likely to destroy whatever was sound in the life of the working\r\nclasses of Paris. Of honest industry there was scarcely a trace to be found\r\namong the masses who were receiving their daily wages from the State.\r\nWhatever the sincerity of those who had founded the national workshops,\r\nwhatever the anxiety for employment on the part of those who first resorted\r\nto them, they had now become mere hives of disorder, where the resources of\r\nthe State were lavished in accumulating a force for its own overthrow. It\r\nwas necessary, at whatever risk, to extinguish the evil. Plans for the\r\ngradual dispersion of the army of workmen were drawn up by Committees and\r\ndiscussed by the Assembly. If put in force with no more than the necessary\r\ndelay, these plans might perhaps have rendered a peaceful solution of the\r\ndifficulty possible. But the Government hesitated, and finally, when a\r\ndecision could no longer be avoided, determined upon measures more violent\r\nand more sudden than those which the Committees had recommended. On the\r\n21st of June an order was published that all occupants of the public\r\nworkshops between the ages of seventeen and twenty-five must enlist in the\r\narmy or cease to receive support from the State, and that the removal of\r\nthe workmen who had come into Paris from the provinces, for which\r\npreparations had already been made, must be at once effected. [422]\r\n\r\n[The Four Days of June, 23-26.]\r\n\r\nThe publication of this order was the signal for an appeal to arms. The\r\nlegions of the national workshops were in themselves a half-organised force\r\nequal in number to several army-corps, and now animated by something like\r\nthe spirit of military union. The revolt, which began on the morning of the\r\n23rd of June, was conducted as no revolt in Pans had ever been conducted\r\nbefore. The eastern part of the city was turned into a maze of barricades.\r\nThough the insurgents had not artillery, they were in other respects fairly\r\narmed. The terrible nature of the conflict impending now became evident to\r\nthe Assembly. General Cavaignac, Minister of War, was placed in command,\r\nand subsequently invested with supreme authority, the Executive Commission\r\nresigning its powers. All the troops in the neighbourhood of Paris were at\r\nonce summoned to the capital, Cavaignac well understood that any attempt to\r\nhold the insurrection in check by means of scattered posts would only end,\r\nas in 1830, by the capture or the demoralisation of the troops. He treated\r\nParis as one great battle-field in which the enemy must be attacked in mass\r\nand driven by main force from all his positions. At times the effort\r\nappeared almost beyond the power of the forces engaged, and the insurgents,\r\nsheltered by huge barricades and firing from the windows of houses, seemed\r\nlikely to remain masters of the field. The struggle continued for four\r\ndays, but Cavaignac's artillery and the discipline of his troops at last\r\ncrushed resistance; and after the Archbishop of Paris had been mortally\r\nwounded in a heroic effort to stop further bloodshed, the last bands of the\r\ninsurgents, driven back into the north-eastern quarter of the city, and\r\nthere attacked with artillery in front and flank, were forced to lay down\r\ntheir arms.\r\n\r\n[Fears left by the events of June.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the conflict of the Four Days of June, a conflict memorable as one\r\nin which the combatants fought not for a political principle or form of\r\nGovernment, but for the preservation or the overthrow of society based on\r\nthe institution of private property. The National Guard, with some\r\nexceptions, fought side by side with the regiments of the line, braved the\r\nsame perils, and sustained an equal loss. The workmen threw themselves the\r\nmore passionately into the struggle, inasmuch as defeat threatened them\r\nwith deprivation of the very means of life. On both sides acts of savagery\r\nwere committed which the fury of the conflict could not excuse. The\r\nvengeance of the conquerors in the moment of success appears, however, to\r\nhave been less unrelenting than that which followed the overthrow of the\r\nCommune in 1871, though, after the struggle was over, the Assembly had no\r\nscruple in transporting without trial the whole mass of prisoners taken\r\nwith arms in their hands. Cavaignac's victory left the classes for whom he\r\nhad fought terror-stricken at the peril from which they had escaped, and\r\nalmost hopeless of their own security under any popular form of Government\r\nin the future. Against the rash and weak concessions to popular demands\r\nthat had been made by the administration since February, especially in the\r\nmatter of taxation and finance, there was now a deep, if not loudly\r\nproclaimed, reaction. The national workshops disappeared; grants were made\r\nby the Legislature for the assistance of the masses who were left without\r\nresource, but the money was bestowed in charitable relief or in the form of\r\nloans to associations, not as wages from the State. On every side among the\r\nholders of property the cry was for a return to sound principles of finance\r\nin the economy of the State, and for the establishment of a strong central\r\npower.\r\n\r\n[Cavaignac and Louis Napoleon.]\r\n\r\n[Louis Napoleon elected Deputy but resigns, June 14.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Cavaignac after the restoration of order had laid down the supreme\r\nauthority which had been conferred on him, but at the desire of the\r\nAssembly he continued to exercise it until the new Constitution should be\r\ndrawn up and an Executive appointed in accordance with its provisions.\r\nEvents had suddenly raised Cavaignac from obscurity to eminence, and seemed\r\nto mark him out as the future ruler of France. But he displayed during the\r\nsix months following the suppression of the revolt no great capacity for\r\ngovernment, and his virtues as well as his defects made against his\r\npersonal success. A sincere Republican, while at the same time a rigid\r\nupholder of law, he refused to lend himself to those who were, except in\r\nname, enemies of Republicanism; and in his official acts and utterances he\r\nspared the feelings of the reactionary classes as little as he would have\r\nspared those of rioters and Socialists. As the influence of Cavaignac\r\ndeclined, another name began to fill men's thoughts. Louis Napoleon, son of\r\nthe Emperor's brother Louis, King of Holland, had while still in exile been\r\nelected to the National Assembly by four Departments. He was as yet almost\r\nunknown except by name to his fellow-countrymen. Born in the Tuileries in\r\n1808, he had been involved as a child in the ruin of the Empire, and had\r\npassed into banishment with his mother Hortense, under the law that\r\nexpelled from France all members of Napoleon's family. He had been brought\r\nup at Augsburg and on the shores of the Lake of Constance, and as a\r\nvolunteer in a Swiss camp of artillery he had gained some little\r\nacquaintance with military life. In 1831 he had joined the insurgents in\r\nthe Romagna who were in arms against the Papal Government. The death of his\r\nown elder brother, followed in 1832 by that of Napoleon's son, the Duke of\r\nReichstadt, made him chief of the house of Bonaparte. Though far more of a\r\nrecluse than a man of action, though so little of his own nation that he\r\ncould not pronounce a sentence of French without a marked German accent,\r\nand had never even seen a French play performed, he now became possessed by\r\nthe fixed idea that he was one day to wear the French Crown. A few obscure\r\nadventurers attached themselves to his fortunes, and in 1836 he appeared at\r\nStrasburg and presented himself to the troops as Emperor. The enterprise\r\nended in failure and ridicule. Louis Napoleon was shipped to America by the\r\nOrleanist Government, which supplied him with money, and thought it\r\nunnecessary even to bring him to trial. He recrossed the Atlantic, made his\r\nhome in England, and in 1840 repeated at Boulogne the attempt that had\r\nfailed at Strasburg. The result was again disastrous. He was now sentenced\r\nto perpetual imprisonment, and passed the next six years in captivity at\r\nHam, where he produced a treatise on the Napoleonic Ideas, and certain\r\nfragments on political and social questions. The enthusiasm for Napoleon,\r\nof which there had been little trace in France since 1815, was now\r\nreviving; the sufferings of the epoch of conquest were forgotten; the\r\nsteady maintenance of peace by Louis Philippe seemed humiliating to young\r\nand ardent spirits who had not known the actual presence of the foreigner.\r\nIn literature two men of eminence worked powerfully upon the national\r\nimagination. The history of Thiers gave the nation a great stage-picture of\r\nNapoleon's exploits; Béranger's lyrics invested his exile at St. Helena\r\nwith an irresistible, though spurious, pathos. Thus, little as the world\r\nconcerned itself with the prisoner at Ham, the tendencies of the time were\r\nworking in his favour; and his confinement, which lasted six years and was\r\nterminated by his escape and return to England, appears to have deepened\r\nhis brooding nature, and to have strengthened rather than diminished his\r\nconfidence in himself. On the overthrow of Louis Philippe he visited Paris,\r\nbut was requested by the Provisional Government, on the ground of the\r\nunrepealed law banishing the Bonaparte family, to quit the country. He\r\nobeyed, probably foreseeing that the difficulties of the Republic would\r\ncreate better opportunities for his reappearance. Meanwhile the group of\r\nunknown men who sought their fortunes in a Napoleonic restoration busily\r\ncanvassed and wrote on behalf of the Prince, and with such success that, in\r\nthe supplementary elections that were held at the beginning of June, he\r\nobtained a fourfold triumph. The Assembly, in spite of the efforts of the\r\nGovernment, pronounced his return valid. Yet with rare self-command the\r\nPrince still adhered to his policy of reserve, resigning his seat on the\r\nground that his election had been made a pretext for movements of which he\r\ndisapproved, while at the same time he declared in his letter to the\r\nPresident of the Assembly that if duties should be imposed upon him by the\r\npeople he should know how to fulfil them. [423]\r\n\r\n[Louis Napoleon again elected, Sept. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Louis Napoleon elected President, Dec. 10.]\r\n\r\nFrom this time Louis Napoleon was a recognised aspirant to power. The\r\nConstitution of the Republic was now being drawn up by the Assembly. The\r\nExecutive Commission had disappeared in the convulsion of June; Cavaignac\r\nwas holding the balance between parties rather than governing himself. In\r\nthe midst of the debates on the Constitution Louis Napoleon was again\r\nreturned elected, to the Assembly by the votes of five Departments. He saw\r\nthat he ought to remain no longer in the background, and, accepting the\r\ncall of the electors, he took his seat in the Chamber. It was clear that he\r\nwould become a candidate for the Presidency of the Republic, and that the\r\npopularity of his name among the masses was enormous. He had twice\r\npresented himself to France as the heir to Napoleon's throne; he had never\r\ndirectly abandoned his dynastic claim; he had but recently declared, in\r\nalmost threatening language, that he should know how to fulfil the duties\r\nthat the people might impose upon him. Yet with all these facts before it\r\nthe Assembly, misled by the puerile rhetoric of Lamartine, decided that in\r\nthe new Constitution the President of the Republic, in whom was vested the\r\nexecutive power, should be chosen by the direct vote of all Frenchmen, and\r\nrejected the amendment of M. Grevy, who, with real insight into the future,\r\ndeclared that such direct election by the people could only give France a\r\nDictator, and demanded that the President should be appointed not by the\r\nmasses but by the Chamber. Thus was the way paved for Louis Napoleon's\r\nmarch to power. The events of June had dispelled any attraction that he had\r\nhitherto felt towards Socialistic theories. He saw that France required an\r\nupholder of order and of property. In his address to the nation announcing\r\nhis candidature for the Presidency he declared that he would shrink from no\r\nsacrifice in defending society, so audaciously attacked; that he would\r\ndevote himself without reserve to the maintenance of the Republic, and make\r\nit his pride to leave to his successor at the end of four years authority\r\nstrengthened, liberty unimpaired, and real progress accomplished. Behind\r\nthese generalities the address dexterously touched on the special wants of\r\nclasses and parties, and promised something to each. The French nation in\r\nthe election which followed showed that it believed in Louis Napoleon even\r\nmore than he did in himself. If there existed in the opinion of the great\r\nmass any element beyond the mere instinct of self-defence against real or\r\nsupposed schemes of spoliation, it was reverence for Napoleon's memory. Out\r\nof seven millions of votes given, Louis Napoleon received above five,\r\nCavaignac, who alone entered into serious competition with him, receiving\r\nabout a fourth part of that number. Lamartine and the men who ten months\r\nbefore had represented all the hopes of the nation now found but a handful\r\nof supporters. Though none yet openly spoke of Monarchy, on all sides there\r\nwas the desire for the restoration of power. The day-dreams of the second\r\nRepublic had fled. France had shown that its choice lay only between a\r\nsoldier who had crushed rebellion and a stranger who brought no title to\r\nits confidence but an Imperial name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAustria and Italy--Vienna from March to May--Flight of the Emperor--\r\nBohemian National Movement--Windischgrätz subdues Prague--Campaign\r\naround Verona--Papal Allocution--Naples in May--Negotiations as to\r\nLombardy--Reconquest of Venetia--Battle of Custozza--The Austrians enter\r\nMilan--Austrian Court and Hungary--The Serbs in Southern Hungary--Serb\r\nCongress at Carlowitz--Jellacic--Affairs of Croatia--Jellacic, the Court\r\nand the Hungarian Movement--Murder of Lamberg--Manifesto of October 3\r\nVienna on October 6--The Emperor at Olmütz--Windischgrätz conquers\r\nVienna--The Parliament at Kremsier--Schwarzenberg Minister--Ferdinand\r\nabdicates--Dissolution of the Kremsier Parliament--Unitary Edict--\r\nHungary--The Roumanians in Transylvania--The Austrian Army occupies\r\nPesth--Hungarian Government at Debreczin--The Austrians driven out of\r\nHungary--Declaration of Hungarian Independence--Russian Intervention--\r\nThe Hungarian Summer Campaign--Capitulation of Vilagos--Italy--Murder of\r\nRossi--Tuscany--The March Campaign in Lombardy--Novara--Abdication of\r\nCharles Albert--Victor Emmanuel--Restoration in Tuscany--French\r\nIntervention in Rome--Defeat of Oudinot--Oudinot and Lesseps--The French\r\nenter Rome--The Restored Pontifical Government--Fall of Venice--\r\nFerdinand reconquers Sicily Germany--The National Assembly at Frankfort--\r\nThe Armistice of Malmö--Berlin from April to September--The Prussian\r\nArmy--Last days of the Prussian Parliament--Prussian Constitution\r\ngranted by Edict--The German National Assembly and Austria--Frederick\r\nWilliam IV. elected Emperor--He refuses the Crown--End of the National\r\nAssembly--Prussia attempts to form a separate Union--The Union\r\nParliament at Erfurt--Action of Austria--Hesse Cassel--The Diet of\r\nFrankfort restored--Olmütz--Schleswig-Holstein--Germany after 1849--\r\nAustria after 1851--France after 1848--Louis Napoleon--The October\r\nMessage--Law Limiting the Franchise--Louis Napoleon and the Army--\r\nProposed Revision of the Constitution--The Coup d'État--Napoleon III.\r\nEmperor\r\n\r\n\r\n[Austria and Italy.]\r\n\r\nThe plain of Northern Italy has ever been an arena on which the contest\r\nbetween interests greater than those of Italy itself has been brought to an\r\nissue, and it may perhaps be truly said that in the struggle between\r\nestablished Governments and Revolution through out Central Europe in 1848\r\nthe real turning point, if it can anywhere be fixed, lay rather in the\r\nfortunes of a campaign in Lombardy than in any single combination of events\r\nat Vienna or Berlin. The very existence of the Austrian Monarchy depended\r\non the victory of Radetzky's forces over the national movement at the head\r\nof which Piedmont had now placed itself. If Italian independence should be\r\nestablished upon the ruin of the Austrian arms, and the influence and\r\nexample of the victorious Italian people be thrown into the scale against\r\nthe Imperial Government in its struggle with the separatist forces that\r\nconvulsed every part of the Austrian dominions, it was scarcely possible\r\nthat any stroke of fortune or policy could save the Empire of the Hapsburgs\r\nfrom dissolution. But on the prostration or recovery of Austria, as\r\nrepresented by its central power at Vienna, the future of Germany in great\r\npart depended. Whatever compromise might be effected between popular and\r\nmonarchical forces in the other German States if left free from Austria's\r\ninterference, the whole influence of a resurgent Austrian power could not\r\nbut be directed against the principles of popular sovereignty and national\r\nunion. The Parliament of Frankfort might then in vain affect to fulfil its\r\nmandate without reckoning with the Court of Vienna. All this was indeed\r\nobscured in the tempests that for a while shut out the political horizon.\r\nThe Liberals of Northern Germany had little sympathy with the Italian cause\r\nin the decisive days of 1848. Their inclinations went rather with the\r\ncombatant who, though bent on maintaining an oppressive dominion, was\r\nnevertheless a member of the German race and paid homage for the moment to\r\nConstitutional rights. Yet, as later events were to prove, the fetters\r\nwhich crushed liberty beyond the Alps could fit as closely on to German\r\nlimbs; and in the warfare of Upper Italy for its own freedom the battle of\r\nGerman Liberalism was in no small measure fought and lost.\r\n\r\n[Vienna from March to May.]\r\n\r\nMetternich once banished from Vienna, the first popular demand was for a\r\nConstitution. His successors in office, with a certain characteristic\r\npedantry, devoted their studies to the Belgian Constitution of 1831; and\r\nafter some weeks a Constitution was published by edict for the\r\nnon-Hungarian part of the Empire, including a Parliament of two Chambers,\r\nthe Lower to be chosen by indirect election, the Upper consisting of\r\nnominees of the Crown and representatives of the great landowners. The\r\nprovisions of this Constitution in favour of the Crown and the Aristocracy,\r\nas well as the arbitrary mode of its promulgation, displeased the Viennese.\r\nAgitation recommenced in the city; unpopular officials were roughly handled\r\nthe Press grew ever more violent and more scurrilous. One strange result of\r\nthe tutelage in which Austrian society had been held was that the students\r\nof the University became, and for some time continued to be, the most\r\nimportant political body of the capital. Their principal rivals in\r\ninfluence were the National Guard drawn from citizens of the middle class,\r\nthe workmen as yet remaining in the background. Neither in the Hall of the\r\nUniversity nor at the taverns where the civic militia discussed the events\r\nof the hour did the office-drawn Constitution find favour. On the 13th of\r\nMay it was determined, with the view of exercising stronger pressure upon\r\nthe Government, that the existing committees of the National Guard and of\r\nthe students should be superseded by one central committee representing\r\nboth bodies. The elections to this committee had been held, and its\r\nsittings had begun, when the commander of the National Guard declared such\r\nproceedings to be inconsistent with military discipline, and ordered the\r\ndissolution of the committee. Riots followed, during which the students and\r\nthe mob made their way into the Emperor's palace and demanded from his\r\nMinisters not only the re-establishment of the central committee but the\r\nabolition of the Upper Chamber in the projected Constitution, and the\r\nremoval of the checks imposed on popular sovereignty by a limited franchise\r\nand the system of indirect elections. On point after point the Ministry\r\ngave way; and, in spite of the resistance and reproaches of the Imperial\r\nhousehold, they obtained the Emperor's signature to a document promising\r\nthat for the future all the important military posts in the city should be\r\nheld by the National Guard jointly with the regular troops, that the latter\r\nshould never be called out except on the requisition of the National Guard,\r\nand that the projected Constitution should remain without force until it\r\nshould have been submitted for confirmation to a single Constituent\r\nAssembly elected by universal suffrage.\r\n\r\n[Flight of the Emperor, May 17.]\r\n\r\n[Tumult of May 26.]\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the Emperor's intelligence rendered him a mere puppet in\r\nthe hands of those who for the moment exercised control over his actions.\r\nDuring the riot of the 15th of May he obeyed his Ministers; a few hours\r\nafterwards he fell under the sway of the Court party, and consented to fly\r\nfrom Vienna. On the 18th the Viennese learnt to their astonishment that\r\nFerdinand was far on the road to the Tyrol. Soon afterwards a manifesto was\r\npublished, stating that the violence and anarchy of the capital had\r\ncompelled the Emperor to transfer his residence to Innsbruck; that he\r\nremained true, however, to the promises made in March and to their\r\nlegitimate consequences; and that proof must be given of the return of the\r\nViennese to their old sentiments of loyalty before he could again appear\r\namong them. A certain revulsion of feeling in the Emperor's favour now\r\nbecame manifest in the capital, and emboldened the Ministers to take the\r\nfirst step necessary towards obtaining his return, namely the dissolution\r\nof the Students' Legion. They could count with some confidence on the\r\nsupport of the wealthier part of the middle class, who were now becoming\r\nwearied of the students' extravagances and alarmed at the interruption of\r\nbusiness caused by the Revolution; moreover, the ordinary termination of\r\nthe academic year was near at hand. The order was accordingly given for the\r\ndissolution of the Legion and the closing of the University. But the\r\nstudents met the order with the stoutest resistance. The workmen poured in\r\nfrom the suburbs to join in their defence. Barricades were erected, and the\r\ninsurrection of March seemed on the point of being renewed. Once more the\r\nGovernment gave way, and not only revoked its order, but declared itself\r\nincapable of preserving tranquillity in the capital unless it should\r\nreceive the assistance of the leaders of the people. With the full\r\nconcurrence of the Ministers, a Committee of Public Safety was formed,\r\nrepresenting at once the students, the middle class, and the workmen; and\r\nit entered upon its duties with an authority exceeding, within the limits\r\nof the capital, that of the shadowy functionaries of State. [424]\r\n\r\n[Bohemian national movement.]\r\n\r\n[Windischgrätz subdues Prague, June 12-17.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the antagonism between the Czechs and the Germans in\r\nBohemia was daily becoming more bitter. The influence of the party of\r\ncompromise, which had been dominant in the early days of March, had\r\ndisappeared before the ill-timed attempt of the German national leaders at\r\nFrankfort to include Bohemia within the territory sending representatives\r\nto the German national Parliament. By consenting to this incorporation the\r\nCzech population would have definitely renounced its newly asserted claim\r\nto nationality. If the growth of democratic spirit at Vienna was\r\naccompanied by a more intense German national feeling in the capital, the\r\npopular movements at Vienna and at Prague must necessarily pass into a\r\nrelation of conflict with one another. On the flight of the Emperor\r\nbecoming known at Prague, Count Thun, the governor, who was also the chief\r\nof the moderate Bohemian party, invited Ferdinand to make Prague the seat\r\nof his Government. This invitation, which would have directly connected the\r\nCrown with Czech national interests, was not accepted. The rasher\r\npoliticians, chiefly students and workmen, continued to hold their meetings\r\nand to patrol the streets; and a Congress of Slavs from all parts of the\r\nEmpire, which was opened on the 2nd of June, excited national passions\r\nstill further. So threatening grew the attitude of the students and workmen\r\nthat Count Windischgrätz, commander of the troops at Prague, prepared to\r\nact with artillery. On the 12th of June, the day on which the Congress of\r\nSlavs broke up, fighting began. Windischgrätz, whose wife was killed by a\r\nbullet, appears to have acted with calmness, and to have sought to arrive\r\nat some peaceful settlement. He withdrew his troops, and desisted from a\r\nbombardment that he had begun, on the understanding that the barricades\r\nwhich had been erected should be removed. This condition was not fulfilled.\r\nNew acts of violence occurred in the city, and on the 17th Windischgrätz\r\nreopened fire. On the following day Prague surrendered, and Windischgrätz\r\nre-entered the city as Dictator. The autonomy of Bohemia was at an end. The\r\narmy had for the first time acted with effect against a popular rising; the\r\nfirst blow had been struck on behalf of the central power against the\r\nrevolution which till now had seemed about to dissolve the Austrian State\r\ninto its fragments.\r\n\r\n[Campaign around Verona, April-May.]\r\n\r\nAt this point the dominant interest in Austrian affairs passes from the\r\ncapital and the northern provinces to Radetzky's army and the Italians with\r\nwhom it stood face to face. Once convinced of the necessity of a retreat\r\nfrom Milan, the Austrian commander had moved with sufficient rapidity to\r\nsave Verona and Mantua from passing into the hands of the insurgents. He\r\nwas thus enabled to place his army in one of the best defensive positions\r\nin Europe, the Quadrilateral flanked by the rivers Mincio and Adige, and\r\nprotected by the fortresses of Verona, Mantua, Peschiera, and Legnano. With\r\nhis front on the Mincio he awaited at once the attack of the Piedmontese\r\nand the arrival of reinforcements from the north-east. On the 8th of April\r\nthe first attack was made, and after a sharp engagement at Goito the\r\npassage of the Mincio was effected by the Sardinian army. Siege was now\r\nlaid to Peschiera; and while a Tuscan contingent watched Mantua, the bulk\r\nof Charles Albert's forces operated farther northward with the view of\r\ncutting off Verona from the roads to the Tyrol. This result was for a\r\nmoment achieved, but the troops at the King's disposal were far too weak\r\nfor the task of reducing the fortresses; and in an attempt that was made on\r\nthe 6th of May to drive the Austrians out of their positions in front of\r\nVerona, Charles Albert was defeated at Santa Lucia and compelled to fall\r\nback towards the Mincio. [425]\r\n\r\n[Papal Allocution, April 29.]\r\n\r\n[Naples in May.]\r\n\r\nA pause in the war ensued, filled by political events of evil omen for\r\nItaly. Of all the princes who had permitted their troops to march\r\nnorthwards to the assistance of the Lombards, not one was acting in full\r\nsincerity. The first to show himself in his true colours was the Pope. On\r\nthe 29th of April an Allocution was addressed to the Cardinals, in which\r\nPius disavowed all participation in the war against Austria, and declared\r\nthat his own troops should do no more than defend the integrity of the\r\nRoman States. Though at the moment an outburst of popular indignation in\r\nRome forced a still more liberal Ministry into power, and Durando, the\r\nPapal general, continued his advance into Venetia, the Pope's renunciation\r\nof his supposed national leadership produced the effect which its author\r\ndesired, encouraging every open and every secret enemy of the Italian\r\ncause, and perplexing those who had believed themselves to be engaged in a\r\nsacred as well as a patriotic war. In Naples things hurried far more\r\nrapidly to a catastrophe. Elections had been held to the Chamber of\r\nDeputies, which was to be opened on the 15th of May, and most of the\r\nmembers returned were men who, while devoted to the Italian national cause\r\nwere neither Republicans nor enemies of the Bourbon dynasty, but anxious to\r\nco-operate with their King in the work of Constitutional reform.\r\nPoliticians of another character, however, commanded the streets of Naples.\r\nRumours were spread that the Court was on the point of restoring despotic\r\ngovernment and abandoning the Italian cause. Disorder and agitation\r\nincreased from day to day; and after the Deputies had arrived in the city\r\nand begun a series of informal meetings preparatory to the opening of the\r\nParliament, an ill-advised act of Ferdinand gave to the party of disorder,\r\nwho were weakly represented in the Assembly, occasion for an insurrection.\r\nAfter promulgating the Constitution on February both, Ferdinand had agreed\r\nthat it should be submitted to the two Chambers for revision. He notified,\r\nhowever, to the Representatives on the eve of the opening of Parliament\r\nthat they would be required to take an oath of fidelity to the\r\nConstitution. They urged that such an oath would deprive them of their\r\nright of revision. The King, after some hours, consented to a change in the\r\nformula of the oath; but his demand had already thrown the city into\r\ntumult. Barricades were erected, the Deputies in vain endeavouring to calm\r\nthe rioters and to prevent a conflict with the troops. While negotiations\r\nwere still in progress shots were fired. The troops now threw themselves\r\nupon the people; there was a struggle, short in duration, but sanguinary\r\nand merciless; the barricades were captured, some hundreds of the\r\ninsurgents slain, and Ferdinand was once more absolute master of Naples.\r\nThe Assembly was dissolved on the day after that on which it should have\r\nmet. Orders were at once sent by the King to General Pepe, commander of the\r\ntroops that were on the march to Lombardy, to return with his army to\r\nNaples. Though Pepe continued true to the national cause, and endeavoured\r\nto lead his army forward from Bologna in defiance of the King's\r\ninstructions, his troops now melted away; and when he crossed the Po and\r\nplaced himself under the standard of Charles Albert in Venetia there\r\nremained with him scarcely fifteen hundred men.\r\n\r\n[Negotiations as to Lombardy.]\r\n\r\n[Reconquest of Venetia, June, July.]\r\n\r\nIt thus became clear before the end of May that the Lombards would receive\r\nno considerable help from the Southern States in their struggle for\r\nfreedom, and that the promised league of the Governments in the national\r\ncause was but a dream from which there was a bitter awakening. Nor in\r\nNorthern Italy itself was there the unity in aim and action without which\r\nsuccess was impossible. The Republican party accused the King and the\r\nProvisional Government at Milan of an unwillingness to arm the people;\r\nCharles Albert on his part regarded every Republican as an enemy. On\r\nentering Lombardy the King had stated that no question as to the political\r\norganisation of the future should be raised until the war was ended;\r\nnevertheless, before a fortress had been captured, he had allowed Modena\r\nand Parma to declare themselves incorporated with the Piedmontese monarchy;\r\nand, in spite of Mazzini's protest, their example was followed by Lombardy\r\nand some Venetian districts. In the recriminations that passed between the\r\nRepublicans and the Monarchists it was even suggested that Austria had\r\nfriends of its own in certain classes of the population. This was not the\r\nview taken by the Viennese Government, which from the first appears to have\r\nconsidered its cause in Lombardy as virtually lost. The mediation of Great\r\nBritain was invoked by Metternich's successors, and a willingness expressed\r\nto grant to the Italian provinces complete autonomy under the Emperor's\r\nsceptre. Palmerston, in reply to the supplications of a Court which had\r\nhitherto cursed his influence, urged that Lombardy and the greater part of\r\nVenetia should be ceded to the King of Piedmont. The Austrian Government\r\nwould have given up Lombardy to their enemy; they hesitated to increase his\r\npower to the extent demanded by Palmerston, the more so as the French\r\nMinistry was known to be jealous of the aggrandisement of Sardinia, and to\r\ndesire the establishment of weak Republics like those formed in 1796.\r\nWithdrawing from its negotiations at London, the Emperor's Cabinet now\r\nentered into direct communication with the Provisional Government at Milan,\r\nand, without making any reference to Piedmont or Venice, offered complete\r\nindependence to Lombardy. As the union of this province with Piedmont had\r\nalready been voted by its inhabitants, the offer was at once rejected.\r\nMoreover, even it the Italians had shown a disposition to compromise their\r\ncause and abandon Venice, Radetzky would not have broken off the combat\r\nwhile any possibility remained of winning over the Emperor from the side\r\nof the peace-party. In reply to instructions directing him to offer an\r\narmistice to the enemy, he sent Prince Felix Schwarzenberg to Innsbruck to\r\nimplore the Emperor to trust to the valour of his soldiers and to continue\r\nthe combat. Already there were signs that the victory would ultimately be\r\nwith Austria. Reinforcements had cut their way through the insurgent\r\nterritory and reached Verona; and although a movement by which Radetzky\r\nthreatened to sever Charles Albert's communications was frustrated by a\r\nsecond engagement at Goito, and Peschiera passed into the besiegers' hands,\r\nthis was the last success won by the Italians. Throwing himself suddenly\r\neastwards, Radetzky appeared before Vicenza, and compelled this city, with\r\nthe entire Papal army, commanded by General Durando, to capitulate. The\r\nfall of Vicenza was followed by that of the other cities on the\r\nVenetian mainland till Venice alone on the east of the Adige defied the\r\nAustrian arms. As the invader pressed onward, an Assembly which Manin had\r\nconvoked at Venice decided on union with Piedmont. Manin himself had been\r\nthe most zealous opponent of what he considered the sacrifice of Venetian\r\nindependence. He gave way nevertheless at the last, and made no attempt to\r\nfetter the decision of the Assembly; but when this decision had been given\r\nhe handed over the conduct of affairs to others, and retired for awhile\r\ninto private life, declining to serve under a king. [426]\r\n\r\n[Battle of Custozza July 25.]\r\n\r\n[Austrians re-enter Milan, Aug. 6.]\r\n\r\nCharles Albert now renewed his attempt to wrest the central fortresses from\r\nthe Austrians. Leaving half his army at Peschiera and farther north, he\r\nproceeded with the other half to blockade Mantua. Radetzky took advantage\r\nof the unskilful generalship of his opponent, and threw himself upon the\r\nweakly guarded centre of the long Sardinian line. The King perceived his\r\nerror, and sought to unite with his the northern detachments, now separated\r\nfrom him by the Mincio. His efforts were baffled, and on the 25th of July,\r\nafter a brave resistance, his troops were defeated at Custozza. The retreat\r\nacross the Mincio was conducted in fair order, but disasters sustained by\r\nthe northern division, which should have held the enemy in check, destroyed\r\nall hope, and the retreat then became a flight. Radetzky followed in close\r\npursuit. Charles Albert entered Milan, but declared himself unable to\r\ndefend the city. A storm of indignation broke out against the unhappy King\r\namongst the Milanese, whom he was declared to have betrayed. The palace\r\nwhere he had taken up his quarters was besieged by the mob; his life was\r\nthreatened; and he escaped with difficulty on the night of August 5th under\r\nthe protection of General La Marmora and a few faithful Guards. A\r\ncapitulation was signed, and as the Piedmontese army evacuated the city\r\nRadetzky's troops entered it in triumph. Not less than sixty thousand of\r\nthe inhabitants, according to Italian statements, abandoned their homes and\r\nsought refuge in Switzerland or Piedmont rather than submit to the\r\nconqueror's rule. Radetzky could now have followed his retreating enemy\r\nwithout difficulty to Turin, and have crushed Piedmont itself under foot;\r\nbut the fear of France and Great Britain checked his career of victory, and\r\nhostilities were brought to a close by an armistice at Vigevano on August\r\n9th. [427]\r\n\r\n[The Austrian Court and Hungary.]\r\n\r\nThe effects of Radetzky's triumph were felt in every province of the\r\nEmpire. The first open expression given to the changed state of affairs was\r\nthe return of the Imperial Court from its refuge at Innsbruck to Vienna.\r\nThe election promised in May had been held, and an Assembly representing\r\nall the non-Hungarian parts of the Monarchy, with the exception of the\r\nItalian provinces, had been opened by the Archduke John, as representative\r\nof the Emperor, on the 22nd of July. Ministers and Deputies united in\r\ndemanding the return of the Emperor to the capital. With Radetzky and\r\nWindischgrätz within call, the Emperor could now with some confidence face\r\nhis students and his Parliament. But of far greater importance than the\r\nreturn of the Court to Vienna was the attitude which it now assumed towards\r\nthe Diet and the national Government of Hungary. The concessions made in\r\nApril, inevitable as they were, had in fact raised Hungary to the position\r\nof an independent State. When such matters as the employment of Hungarian\r\ntroops against Italy or the distribution of the burden of taxation came\r\ninto question, the Emperor had to treat with the Hungarian Ministry almost\r\nas if it represented a foreign and a rival Power. For some months this\r\nhumiliation had to be borne, and the appearance of fidelity to the new\r\nConstitutional law maintained. But a deep, resentful hatred against the\r\nMagyar cause penetrated the circles in which the old military and official\r\nabsolutism of Austria yet survived; and behind the men and the policy still\r\nrepresenting with some degree of sincerity the new order of things, there\r\ngathered the passions and the intrigues of a reaction that waited only for\r\nthe outbreak of civil war within Hungary itself, and the restoration of\r\nconfidence to the Austrian army, to draw the sword against its foe.\r\nAlready, while Italy was still unsubdued, and the Emperor was scarcely safe\r\nin his palace at Vienna, the popular forces that might be employed against\r\nthe Government at Pesth came into view.\r\n\r\n[The Serbs in Southern Hungary.]\r\n\r\n[Serb Congress at Carlowitz, May 13-15.]\r\n\r\nIn one of the stormy sessions of the Hungarian Diet at the time when the\r\nattempt was first made to impose the Magyar language upon Croatia the\r\nIllyrian leader, Gai, had thus addressed the Assembly: \"You Magyars are an\r\nisland in the ocean of Slavism. Take heed that its waves do not rise and\r\noverwhelm you.\" The agitation of the spring of 1848 first revealed in its\r\nfull extent the peril thus foreshadowed. Croatia had for above a year been\r\nin almost open mutiny, but the spirit of revolt now spread through the\r\nwhole of the Serb population of Southern Hungary, from the eastern limits\r\nof Slavonia, [428] across the plain known as the Banat beyond the junction\r\nof the Theiss and the Danube, up to the borders of Transylvania. The Serbs\r\nhad been welcomed into these provinces in the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies by the sovereigns of Austria as a bulwark against the Turks.\r\nCharters had been given to them, which were still preserved, promising them\r\na distinct political administration under their own elected Voivode, and\r\necclesiastical independence under their own Patriarch of the Greek Church.\r\n[429] These provincial rights had fared much as others in the Austrian\r\nEmpire. The Patriarch and the Voivode had disappeared, and the Banat had\r\nbeen completely merged in Hungary. Enough, however, of Serb nationality\r\nremained to kindle at the summons of 1848, and to resent with a sudden\r\nfierceness the determination of the Magyar rulers at Pesth that the Magyar\r\nlanguage, as the language of State, should thenceforward bind together all\r\nthe races of Hungary in the enjoyment of a common national life. The Serbs\r\nhad demanded from Kossuth and his colleagues the restoration of the local\r\nand ecclesiastical autonomy of which the Hapsburgs had deprived them, and\r\nthe recognition of their own national language and customs. They found, or\r\nbelieved, that instead of a German they were now to have a Magyar lord, and\r\none more near, more energetic, more aggressive. Their reply to Kossuth's\r\ndefence of Magyar ascendency was the summoning of a Congress of Serbs at\r\nCarlowitz on the Lower Danube. Here it was declared that the Serbs of\r\nAustria formed a free and independent nation under the Austrian sceptre and\r\nthe common Hungarian Crown. A Voivode was elected and the limits of his\r\nprovince were defined. A National Committee was charged with the duty of\r\norganising a Government and of entering into intimate connection with the\r\nneighbouring Slavic Kingdom of Croatia.\r\n\r\n[Jellacic in Croatia.]\r\n\r\nAt Agram, the Croatian capital, all established authority had sunk in the\r\ncatastrophe of March, and a National Committee had assumed power. It\r\nhappened that the office of Governor, or Ban, of Croatia was then vacant.\r\nThe Committee sent a deputation to Vienna requesting that the colonel of\r\nthe first Croatian regiment, Jellacic, might be appointed. Without waiting\r\nfor the arrival of the deputation, the Court, by a patent dated the 23rd of\r\nMarch, nominated Jellacic to the vacant post. The date of this appointment,\r\nand the assumption of office by Jellacic on the 14th of April, the very day\r\nbefore the Hungarian Ministry entered upon its powers, have been considered\r\nproof that a secret understanding existed from the first between Jellacic\r\nand the Court. No further evidence of this secret relation has, however,\r\nbeen made public, and the belief long current among all friends of the\r\nMagyar cause that Croatia was deliberately instigated to revolt against the\r\nHungarian Government by persons around the Emperor seems to rest on no\r\nsolid foundation. The Croats would have been unlike all other communities\r\nin the Austrian Empire if they had not risen under the national impulse of\r\n1848. They had been murmuring against Magyar ascendency for years past, and\r\nthe fire long smouldering now probably burst into flame here as elsewhere\r\nwithout the touch of an incendiary hand. With regard to Jellacic's sudden\r\nappointment it is possible that the Court, powerless to check the Croatian\r\nmovement, may have desired to escape the appearance of compulsion by\r\nspontaneously conferring office on the popular soldier, who was at least\r\nmore likely to regard the Emperor's interests than the lawyers and\r\ndemagogues around him. Whether Jellacic was at this time genuinely\r\nconcerned for Croatian autonomy, or whether from the first, while he\r\napparently acted with the Croatian nationalists his deepest sympathies were\r\nwith the Austrian army, and his sole design was that of serving the\r\nImperial Crown with or without its own avowed concurrence, it is impossible\r\nto say. That, like most of his countrymen, he cordially hated the Magyars,\r\nis beyond doubt. The general impression left by his character hardly\r\naccords with the Magyar conception of him as the profound and far-sighted\r\nconspirator--he would seem, on the contrary, to have been a man easily\r\nyielding to the impulses of the moment, and capable of playing\r\ncontradictory parts with little sense of his own inconsistency. [430]\r\n\r\n[Affairs of Croatia April 14-June 16.]\r\n\r\nInstalled in office, Jellacic cast to the winds all consideration due to\r\nthe Emperor's personal engagements towards Hungary, and forthwith permitted\r\nthe Magyar officials to be driven out of the country. On the 2nd of May he\r\nissued an order forbidding all Croatian authorities to correspond with the\r\nGovernment at Pesth. Batthyány, the Hungarian Premier, at once hurried to\r\nVienna, and obtained from the Emperor a letter commanding Jellacic to\r\nsubmit to the Hungarian Ministry. As the Ban paid no attention to this\r\nmandate, General Hrabowsky, commander of the troops in the southern\r\nprovinces, received orders from Pesth to annul all that Jellacic had done,\r\nto suspend him from his office, and to bring him to trial for high treason.\r\nNothing daunted, Jellacic on his own authority convoked the Diet of Croatia\r\nfor the 5th of June; the populace of Agram, on hearing of Hrabowsky's\r\nmission, burnt the Palatine in effigy. This was a direct outrage on the\r\nImperial family, and Batthyány turned it to account. The Emperor had just\r\nbeen driven from Vienna by the riot of the 15th of May. Batthyány sought\r\nhim at Innsbruck, and by assuring him of the support of his loyal\r\nHungarians against both the Italians and the Viennese obtained his\r\nsignature on June 10th to a rescript vehemently condemning the Ban's action\r\nand suspending him from office. Jellacic had already been summoned to\r\nappear at Innsbruck. He set out, taking with him a deputation of Croats and\r\nSerbs, and leaving behind him a popular Assembly sitting at Agram, in\r\nwhich, besides the representatives of Croatia, there were seventy Deputies\r\nfrom the Serb provinces. On the very day on which the Ban reached\r\nInnsbruck, the Imperial order condemning him and suspending him from his\r\nfunctions was published by Batthyány at Pesth. Nor was the situation made\r\neasier by the almost simultaneous announcement that civil war had broken\r\nout on the Lower Danube, and that General Hrabowsky, on attempting to\r\noccupy Carlowitz, had been attacked and compelled to retreat by the Serbs\r\nunder their national leader Stratimirovic. [431]\r\n\r\n[Jellacic, the Court, and the Hungarian Government.]\r\n\r\nIt is said that the Emperor Ferdinand, during deliberations in council on\r\nwhich the fate of the Austrian Empire depended, was accustomed to occupy\r\nhimself with counting the number of carriages that passed from right and\r\nleft respectively under the windows. In the struggle between Croatia and\r\nHungary he appears to have avoided even the formal exercise of authority,\r\npreferring to commit the decision between the contending parties to the\r\nArchduke John, as mediator or judge. John was too deeply immersed in other\r\nbusiness to give much attention to the matter. What really passed between\r\nJellacic and the Imperial family at Innsbruck is unknown. The official\r\nrequest of the Ban was for the withdrawal or suppression of the rescript\r\nsigned by the Emperor on June 10th. Prince Esterhazy, who represented the\r\nHungarian Government at Innsbruck, was ready to make this concession; but\r\nbefore the document could be revoked, it had been made public by Batthyány.\r\nWith the object of proving his fidelity to the Court, Jellacic now\r\npublished an address to the Croatian regiments serving in Lombardy,\r\nentreating them not to be diverted from their duty to the Emperor in the\r\nfield by any report of danger to their rights and their nationality nearer\r\nhome. So great was Jellacic's influence with his countrymen that an appeal\r\nfrom him of opposite tenor would probably have caused the Croatian\r\nregiments to quit Radetzky in a mass, and so have brought the war in Italy\r\nto an ignominious end. His action won for him a great popularity in the\r\nhigher ranks of the Austrian army, and probably gained for him, even if he\r\ndid not possess it before, the secret confidence of the Court. That some\r\nunderstanding now existed is almost certain, for, in spite of the\r\nunrepealed declaration of June 10th, and the postponement of the Archduke's\r\njudgment, Jellacic was permitted to return to Croatia and to resume his\r\ngovernment. The Diet at Agram occupied itself with far-reaching schemes for\r\na confederation of the southern Slavs; but its discussions were of no\r\npractical effect, and after some weeks it was extinguished under the form\r\nof an adjournment. From this time Jellacic held dictatorial power. It was\r\nunnecessary for him in his relations with Hungary any longer to keep up the\r\nfiction of a mere defence of Croatian rights; he appeared openly as the\r\nchampion of Austrian unity. In negotiations which he held with Batthyány at\r\nVienna during the last days of July, he demanded the restoration of single\r\nMinistries for War, Finance, and Foreign Affairs for the whole Austrian\r\nEmpire. The demand was indignantly refused, and the chieftains of the two\r\nrival races quitted Vienna to prepare for war.\r\n\r\n[Imminent breach between Austria and Hungary.]\r\n\r\n[Jellacic restored to office, Sept. 3. He marches on Pesth.]\r\n\r\nThe Hungarian National Parliament, elected under the new Constitution, had\r\nbeen opened at Pesth on July 5th. Great efforts had been made, in view of\r\nthe difficulties with Croatia and of the suspected intrigues between the\r\nBan and the Court party, to induce the Emperor Ferdinand to appear at Pesth\r\nin person. He excused himself from this on the ground of illness, but sent\r\na letter to the Parliament condemning not only in his own name but in that\r\nof every member of the Imperial family the resistance offered to the\r\nHungarian Government in the southern provinces. If words bore any meaning,\r\nthe Emperor stood pledged to a loyal co-operation with the Hungarian\r\nMinisters in defence of the unity and the constitution of the Hungarian\r\nKingdom as established by the laws of April. Yet at this very time the\r\nMinister of War at Vienna was encouraging Austrian officers to join the\r\nSerb insurgents. Kossuth, who conducted most of the business of the\r\nHungarian Government in the Lower Chamber at Pesth, made no secret of his\r\nhostility to the central powers. While his colleagues sought to avoid a\r\nbreach with the other half of the Monarchy, it seemed to be Kossuth's\r\nobject rather to provoke it. In calling for a levy of two hundred thousand\r\nmen to crash the Slavic rebellion, he openly denounced the Viennese\r\nMinistry and the Court as its promoters. In leading the debate upon the\r\nItalian War, he endeavoured without the knowledge of his colleagues to\r\nmake the cession of the territory west of the Adige a condition of\r\nHungary's participation in the struggle. As Minister of Finance, he spared\r\nneither word nor act to demonstrate his contempt for the financial\r\ninterests of Austria. Whether a gentler policy on the part of the most\r\npowerful statesman in Hungary might have averted the impending conflict it\r\nis vain to ask; but in the uncompromising enmity of Kossuth the Austrian\r\nCourt found its own excuse for acts in which shamelessness seemed almost to\r\nrise into political virtue. No sooner had Radetzky's victories and the fall\r\nof Milan brought the Emperor back to Vienna than the new policy came into\r\neffect. The veto of the sovereign was placed upon the laws passed by the\r\nDiet at Pesth for the defence of the Kingdom. The Hungarian Government was\r\nrequired to reinstate Jellacic in his dignities, to enter into negotiations\r\nat Vienna with him and the Austrian Ministry, and finally to desist from\r\nall military preparations against the rebellious provinces. In answer to\r\nthese demands the Diet sent a hundred of its members to Vienna to claim\r\nfrom the Emperor the fulfilment of his plighted word. The miserable man\r\nreceived them on the 9th of September with protestations of his sincerity;\r\nbut even before the deputation had passed the palace-gates, there appeared\r\nin the official gazette a letter under the Emperor's own hand replacing\r\nJellacic in office and acquitting him of every charge that had been brought\r\nagainst him. It was for this formal recognition alone that Jellacic had\r\nbeen waiting. On the 11th of September he crossed the Drave with his army,\r\nand began his march against the Hungarian capital. [432]\r\n\r\n[Mission of Lamberg. He is murdered at Pesth, Sept. 28.]\r\n\r\nThe Ministry now in office at Vienna was composed in part of men who had\r\nbeen known as reformers in the early days of 1848; but the old order was\r\nrepresented by Count Wessenberg, who had been Metternich's assistant at the\r\nCongress of Vienna, and by Latour, the War Minister, a soldier of high\r\nbirth whose career dated back to the campaign of Austerlitz. Whatever\r\ncontempt might be felt by one section of the Cabinet for the other, its\r\nmembers were able to unite against the independence of Hungary as they had\r\nunited against the independence of Italy. They handed in to the Emperor a\r\nmemorial in which the very concessions to which they owed their own\r\nexistence as a Constitutional Ministry were made a ground for declaring the\r\nlaws establishing Hungarian autonomy null and void. In a tissue of\r\ntransparent sophistries they argued that the Emperor's promise of a\r\nConstitution to all his dominions on the 15th of March disabled him from\r\nassenting, without the advice of his Viennese Ministry, to the resolutions\r\nsubsequently passed by the Hungarian Diet, although the union between\r\nHungary and the other Hereditary States had from the first rested solely on\r\nthe person of the monarch, and no German official had ever pretended to\r\nexercise authority over Hungarians otherwise than by order of the sovereign\r\nas Hungarian King. The publication of this Cabinet memorial, which appeared\r\nin the journals at Pesth on the 15th of September, gave plain warning to\r\nthe Hungarians that, if they were not to be attacked by Jellacic and the\r\nAustrian army simultaneously, they must make some compromise with the\r\nGovernment at Vienna. Batthyány was inclined to concession, and after\r\nresigning office in consequence of the Emperor's desertion he had already\r\nre-assumed his post with colleagues disposed to accept his own pacific\r\npolicy. Kossuth spoke openly of war with Austria and of a dictatorship. As\r\nJellacic advanced towards Pesth, the Palatine took command of the Hungarian\r\narmy and marched southwards. On reaching Lake Baloton, on whose southern\r\nshore the Croats were encamped, he requested a personal conference with\r\nJellacic, and sailed to the appointed place of meeting. But he waited in\r\nvain for the Ban; and rightly interpreting this rejection of his overtures,\r\nhe fled from the army and laid down his office. The Emperor now sent\r\nGeneral Lamberg from Vienna with orders to assume the supreme command alike\r\nover the Magyar and the Croatian forces, and to prevent an encounter. On\r\nthe success of Lamberg's mission hung the last chance of reconciliation\r\nbetween Hungary and Austria. Batthyány, still clinging to the hope of\r\npeace, set out for the camp in order to meet the envoy on his arrival.\r\nLamberg, desirous of obtaining the necessary credentials from the Hungarian\r\nGovernment, made his way to Pesth. There he found Kossuth and a Committee\r\nof Six installed in power. Under their influence the Diet passed a\r\nresolution forbidding Lamberg to assume command of the Hungarian troops,\r\nand declaring him a traitor if he should attempt to do so. The report\r\nspread through Pesth that Lamberg had come to seize the citadel and bombard\r\nthe town; and before he could reach a place of safety he was attacked and\r\nmurdered by a raging mob. It was in vain that Batthyány, who now laid down\r\nhis office, besought the Government at Vienna to take no rash step of\r\nvengeance. The pretext for annihilating Hungarian independence had been\r\ngiven, and the mask was cast aside. A manifesto published by the Emperor on\r\nthe 3rd of October declared the Hungarian Parliament dissolved, and its\r\nacts null and void. Martial law was proclaimed, and Jellacic appointed\r\ncommander of all the forces and representative of the sovereign. In the\r\ncourse of the next few days it was expected that he would enter Pesth as\r\nconqueror.\r\n\r\n[Manifesto of Oct. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Tumult of Oct. 6 at Vienna. Latour murdered.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however confidently the Government might reckon on\r\nJellacic's victory, the passions of revolution were again breaking loose in\r\nVienna itself. Increasing misery among the poor, financial panics, the\r\nreviving efforts of professional agitators, had renewed the disturbances of\r\nthe spring in forms which alarmed the middle classes almost as much as the\r\nholders of power. The conflict of the Government with Hungary brought\r\naffairs to a crisis. After discovering the uselessness of negotiations with\r\nthe Emperor, the Hungarian Parliament had sent some of its ablest members\r\nto request an audience from the Assembly sitting at Vienna, in order that\r\nthe representatives of the western half of the Empire might, even at the\r\nlast moment, have the opportunity of pronouncing a judgment upon the action\r\nof the Court. The most numerous group in the Assembly was formed by the\r\nCzech deputies from Bohemia. As Slavs, the Bohemian deputies had\r\nsympathised with the Croats and Serbs in their struggle against Magyar\r\nascendency, and in their eyes Jellacic was still the champion of a national\r\ncause. Blinded by their sympathies of race to the danger involved to all\r\nnationalities alike by the restoration of absolutism, the Czech majority,\r\nin spite of a singularly impressive warning given by a leader of the German\r\nLiberals, refused a hearing to the Hungarian representatives. The Magyars,\r\nrepelled by the Assembly, sought and found allies in the democracy of\r\nVienna itself. The popular clubs rang with acclamations for the cause of\r\nHungarian freedom and with invectives against the Czech instruments of\r\ntyranny. In the midst of this deepening agitation tidings arrived at Vienna\r\nthat Jellacic had been repulsed in his march on Pesth and forced to retire\r\nwithin the Austrian frontier. It became necessary for the Viennese\r\nGovernment to throw its own forces into the struggle, and an order was\r\ngiven by Latour to the regiments in the capital to set out for the scene of\r\nwarfare. This order had, however, been anticipated by the democratic\r\nleaders, and a portion of the troops had been won over to the popular side.\r\nLatour's commands were resisted; and upon an attempt being made to enforce\r\nthe departure of the troops, the regiments fired on one another (October\r\n6th). The battalions of the National Guard which rallied to the support of\r\nthe Government were overpowered by those belonging to the working men's\r\ndistricts. The insurrection was victorious; the Ministers submitted once\r\nmore to the masters of the streets, and the orders given to the troops were\r\nwithdrawn. But the fiercer part of the mob was not satisfied with a\r\npolitical victory. There were criminals and madmen among its leaders who,\r\nafter the offices of Government had been stormed and Latour had been\r\ncaptured, determined upon his death. It was in vain that some of the\r\nkeenest political opponents of the Minister sought at the peril of their\r\nown lives to protect him from his murderers. He was dragged into the court\r\nin front of the War Office, and there slain with ferocious and yet\r\ndeliberate barbarity. [433]\r\n\r\n[The Emperor at Olmütz.]\r\n\r\n[Windischgrätz marches on Vienna.]\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, while the city was still in tumult, had in his usual fashion\r\npromised that the popular demands should be satisfied; but as soon as he\r\nwas unobserved he fled from Vienna, and in his flight he was followed by\r\nthe Czech deputies and many German Conservatives, who declared that their\r\nlives were no longer safe in the capital. Most of the Ministers gathered\r\nround the Emperor at Olmütz in Moravia; the Assembly, however, continued to\r\nhold its sittings in Vienna, and the Finance Minister, apparently under\r\ninstructions from the Court, remained at his post, and treated the Assembly\r\nas still possessed of legal powers. But for all practical purposes the\r\nwestern half of the Austrian Empire had now ceased to have any Government\r\nwhatever; and the real state of affairs was bluntly exposed in a manifesto\r\npublished by Count Windischgrätz at Prague on the 11th of October, in\r\nwhich, without professing to have received any commission from the Emperor,\r\nhe announced his intention of marching on Vienna in order to protect the\r\nsovereign and maintain the unity of the Empire. In due course the Emperor\r\nratified the action of his energetic soldier; Windischgrätz was appointed\r\nto the supreme command over all the troops of the Empire with the exception\r\nof Radetzky's army, and his march against Vienna was begun.\r\n\r\n[Windischgrätz conquers Vienna, Oct. 26-Nov. 1.]\r\n\r\nTo the Hungarian Parliament, exasperated by the decree ordering its own\r\ndissolution and the war openly levied against the country by the Court in\r\nalliance with Jellacic, the revolt of the capital seemed to bring a sudden\r\ndeliverance from all danger. The Viennese had saved Hungary, and the Diet\r\nwas willing, if summoned by the Assembly at Vienna, to send its troops to\r\nthe defence of the capital. But the urgency of the need was not understood\r\non either side till too late. The Viennese Assembly, treating itself as a\r\nlegitimate and constitutional power threatened by a group of soldiers who\r\nhad usurped the monarch's authority, hesitated to compromise its legal\r\ncharacter by calling in a Hungarian army. The Magyar generals on the other\r\nhand were so anxious not to pass beyond the strict defence of their own\r\nkingdom, that, in the absence of communication from a Viennese authority,\r\nthey twice withdrew from Austrian soil after following Jellacic in pursuit\r\nbeyond the frontier. It was not until Windischgrätz had encamped within\r\nsight of Vienna, and had detained as a rebel the envoy sent to him by the\r\nHungarian Government, that Kossuth's will prevailed over the scruples of\r\nweaker men, and the Hungarian army marched against the besiegers. In the\r\nmeantime Windischgrätz had begun his attack on the suburbs, which were\r\nweakly defended by the National Guard and by companies of students and\r\nvolunteers, the nominal commander being one Messenhauser, formerly an\r\nofficer in the regular army, who was assisted by a soldier of far greater\r\nmerit than himself, the Polish general Bem. Among those who fought were two\r\nmembers of the German Parliament of Frankfort, Robert Blum and Fröbel, who\r\nhad been sent to mediate between the Emperor and his subjects, but had\r\nremained at Vienna as combatants. The besiegers had captured the outskirts\r\nof the city, and negotiations for surrender were in progress, when, on the\r\n30th of October, Messenhauser from the top of the cathedral tower saw\r\nbeyond the line of the besiegers on the south-east the smoke of battle, and\r\nannounced that the Hungarian army was approaching. An engagement had in\r\nfact begun on the plain of Schwechat between the Hungarians and Jellacic,\r\nreinforced by divisions of Windischgrätz's troops. In a moment of wild\r\nexcitement the defenders of the capital threw themselves once more upon\r\ntheir foe, disregarding the offer of surrender that had been already made.\r\nBut the tide of battle at Schwechat turned against the Hungarians. They\r\nwere compelled to retreat, and Windischgrätz, reopening his cannonade upon\r\nthe rebels who were also violators of their truce, became in a few hours\r\nmaster of Vienna. He made his entry on the 31st of October, and treated\r\nVienna as a conquered city. The troops had behaved with ferocity during the\r\ncombat in the suburbs, and slaughtered scores of unarmed persons. No\r\nOriental tyrant ever addressed his fallen foes with greater insolence and\r\ncontempt for human right than Windischgrätz in the proclamations which, on\r\nassuming government, he addressed to the Viennese; yet, whatever might be\r\nthe number of persons arrested and imprisoned, the number now put to death\r\nwas not great. The victims were indeed carefully selected; the most\r\nprominent being Robert Blum, in whom, as a leader of the German Liberals\r\nand a Deputy of the German Parliament inviolable by law, the Austrian\r\nGovernment struck ostentatiously at the Parliament itself and at German\r\ndemocracy at large.\r\n\r\n[The Parliament at Kremsier, Nov. 22.]\r\n\r\n[Schwarzenberg Minister.]\r\n\r\nIn the subjugation of Vienna the army had again proved itself the real\r\npolitical power in Austria; but the time had not yet arrived when absolute\r\ngovernment could be openly restored. The Bohemian deputies, fatally as they\r\nhad injured the cause of constitutional rule by their secession from\r\nVienna, were still in earnest in the cause of provincial autonomy, and\r\nwould vehemently have repelled the charge of an alliance with despotism.\r\nEven the mutilated Parliament of Vienna had been recognised by the Court as\r\nin lawful session until the 22nd of October, when an order was issued\r\nproroguing the Parliament and bidding it re-assemble a month later at\r\nKremsier, in Moravia. There were indications in the weeks succeeding the\r\nfall of Vienna of a conflict between the reactionary and the more liberal\r\ninfluences surrounding the Emperor, and of an impending _coup d'etat_:\r\nbut counsels of prudence prevailed for the moment; the Assembly was\r\npermitted to meet at Kremsier, and professions of constitutional principle\r\nwere still made with every show of sincerity. A new Ministry, however, came\r\ninto office, with Prince Felix Schwarzenberg at its head. Schwarzenberg\r\nbelonged to one of the greatest Austrian families. He had been ambassador\r\nat Naples when the revolution of 1848 broke out, and had quitted the city\r\nwith words of menace when insult was offered to the Austrian flag.\r\nExchanging diplomacy for war, he served under Radetzky, and was soon\r\nrecognised as the statesman in whom the army, as a political power, found\r\nits own peculiar representative. His career had hitherto been illustrated\r\nchiefly by scandals of private life so flagrant that England and other\r\ncountries where he had held diplomatic posts had insisted on his removal;\r\nbut the cynical and reckless audacity of the man rose in his new calling as\r\nMinister of Austria to something of political greatness. Few statesmen have\r\nbeen more daring than Schwarzenberg; few have pushed to more excessive\r\nlengths the advantages to be derived from the moral or the material\r\nweakness of an adversary. His rule was the debauch of forces respited in\r\ntheir extremity for one last and worst exertion. Like the Roman Sulla, he\r\ngave to a condemned and perishing cause the passing semblance of restored\r\nvigour, and died before the next great wave of change swept his creations\r\naway.\r\n\r\n[Ferdinand abdicates, Dec. 2. Francis Joseph Emperor.]\r\n\r\n[Dissolution of the Kremsier Parliament, March 7, 1849.]\r\n\r\n[The Unitary Constitutional Edict, March, 1849.]\r\n\r\nSchwarzenberg's first act was the deposition of his sovereign. The\r\nimbecility of the Emperor Ferdinand had long suggested his abdication or\r\ndethronement, and the time for decisive action had now arrived. He gladly\r\nwithdrew into private life: the crown, declined by his brother and heir,\r\nwas passed on to his nephew, Francis Joseph, a youth of eighteen. This\r\nprince had at least not made in person, not uttered with his own lips, not\r\nsigned with his own hand, those solemn engagements with the Hungarian\r\nnation which Austria was now about to annihilate with fire and sword. He\r\nhad not moved in friendly intercourse with men who were henceforth doomed\r\nto the scaffold. He came to the throne as little implicated in the acts of\r\nhis predecessor as any nominal chief of a State could be; as fitting an\r\ninstrument in the hands of Court and army as any reactionary faction could\r\ndesire. Helpless and well-meaning, Francis Joseph, while his troops poured\r\ninto Hungary, played for a while in Austria the part of a loyal observer of\r\nhis Parliament; then, when the moment had come for its destruction, he\r\nobeyed his soldier-minister as Ferdinand had in earlier days obeyed the\r\nstudents, and signed the decree for its dissolution (March 4, 1849). The\r\nAssembly, during its sittings at Vienna, had accomplished one important\r\ntask: it had freed the peasantry from the burdens attaching to their land\r\nand converted them into independent proprietors. This part of its work\r\nsurvived it, and remained almost the sole gain that Austria derived from\r\nthe struggle of 1848. After the removal to Kremsier, a Committee of the\r\nAssembly had been engaged with the formation of a Constitution for Austria,\r\nand the draft was now completed. In the course of debate something had been\r\ngained by the representatives of the German and the Slavic races in the way\r\nof respect for one another's interests and prejudices; some political\r\nknowledge had been acquired; some approach made to an adjustment between\r\nthe claims of the central power and of provincial autonomy. If the\r\nConstitution sketched at Kremsier had come into being, it would at least\r\nhave given to Western Austria and to Galicia, which belonged to this half\r\nof the Empire, a system of government based on popular desires and worthy,\r\non the part of the Crown, of a fair trial. But, apart from its own defects\r\nfrom the monarchical point of view, this Constitution rested on the\r\ndivision of the Empire into two independent parts; it assumed the\r\nseparation of Hungary from the other Hereditary States; and of a separate\r\nHungarian Kingdom the Minister now in power would hear no longer. That\r\nHungary had for centuries possessed and maintained its rights; that, with\r\nthe single exception of the English, no nation in Europe had equalled the\r\nMagyars in the stubborn and unwearied defence of Constitutional law; that,\r\nin an age when national spirit was far less hotly inflamed, the Emperor\r\nJoseph had well-nigh lost his throne and wrecked his Empire in the attempt\r\nto subject this resolute race to a centralised administration, was nothing\r\nto Schwarzenberg and the soldiers who were now trampling upon revolution.\r\nHungary was declared to have forfeited by rebellion alike its ancient\r\nrights and the contracts of 1848. The dissolution of the Parliament of\r\nKremsier was followed by the publication of an edict affecting to bestow a\r\nuniform and centralised Constitution upon the entire Austrian Empire. All\r\nexisting public rights were thereby extinguished; and, inasmuch as the new\r\nConstitution, in so far as it provided for a representative system, never\r\ncame into existence, but remained in abeyance until it was formally\r\nabrogated in 1851, the real effect of the Unitary Edict of March, 1849,\r\nwhich professed to close the period of revolution by granting the same\r\nrights to all, was to establish absolute government and the rule of the\r\nsword throughout the Emperor's dominions. Provincial institutions giving to\r\nsome of the German and Slavic districts a shadowy control of their own\r\nlocal affairs only marked the distinction between the favoured and the\r\ndreaded parts of the Empire. Ten years passed before freedom again came\r\nwithin sight of the Austrian peoples. [434]\r\n\r\n[Hungary.]\r\n\r\n[The Roumanians in Transylvania.]\r\n\r\nThe Hungarian Diet, on learning of the transfer of the crown from Ferdinand\r\nto Francis Joseph, had refused to acknowledge this act as valid, on the\r\nground that it had taken place without the consent of the Legislature, and\r\nthat Francis Joseph had not been crowned King of Hungary. Ferdinand was\r\ntreated as still the reigning sovereign, and the war now became, according\r\nto the Hungarian view, more than ever a war in defence of established\r\nright, inasmuch as the assailants of Hungary were not only violators of a\r\nsettled constitution but agents of a usurping prince. The whole nation was\r\nsummoned to arms; and in order that there might be no faltering at\r\nheadquarters, the command over the forces on the Danube was given by\r\nKossuth to Görgei, a young officer of whom little was yet known to the\r\nworld but that he had executed Count Eugène Zichy, a powerful noble, for\r\nholding communications with Jellacic. It was the design of the Austrian\r\nGovernment to attack Hungary at once by the line of the Danube and from the\r\nfrontier of Galicia on the north-east. The Serbs were to be led forward\r\nfrom their border-provinces against the capital; and another race, which\r\ncenturies of oppression had filled with bitter hatred of the Magyars, was\r\nto be thrown into the struggle. The mass of the population of Transylvania\r\nbelonged to the Roumanian stock. The Magyars, here known by the name of\r\nSzeklers, and a community of Germans, descended from immigrants who settled\r\nin Transylvania about the twelfth century, formed a small but a privileged\r\nminority, in whose presence the Roumanian peasantry, poor, savage, and\r\nabsolutely without political rights, felt themselves before 1848 scarcely\r\nremoved from serfdom. In the Diet of Transylvania the Magyars held command,\r\nand in spite of the resistance of the Germans, they had succeeded in\r\ncarrying an Act, in May, 1848, uniting the country with Hungary. This Act\r\nhad been ratified by the Emperor Ferdinand, but it was followed by a\r\nwidespread insurrection of the Roumanian peasantry, who were already\r\nasserting their claims as a separate nation and demanding equality with\r\ntheir oppressors. The rising of the Roumanians had indeed more of the\r\ncharacter of an agrarian revolt than of a movement for national\r\nindependence. It was marked by atrocious cruelty; and although the Hapsburg\r\nstandard was raised, the Austrian commandant, General Puchner, hesitated\r\nlong before lending the insurgents his countenance. At length, in October,\r\nhe declared against the Hungarian Government. The union of the regular\r\ntroops with the peasantry overpowered for a time all resistance. The towns\r\nfell under Austrian sway, and although the Szeklers were not yet disarmed,\r\nTransylvania seemed to be lost to Hungary. General Puchner received orders\r\nto lead his troops, with the newly formed Roumanian militia, westward into\r\nthe Banat, in order to co-operate in the attack which was to overwhelm the\r\nHungarians from every quarter of the kingdom. [435]\r\n\r\n[The Austrians occupy Pesth, Jan. 5, 1849.]\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of December, Windischgrätz, in command of the main Austrian\r\narmy, crossed the river Leitha, the border between German and Magyar\r\nterritory. Görgei, who was opposed to him, had from the first declared that\r\nPesth must be abandoned and a war of defence carried on in Central Hungary.\r\nKossuth, however, had scorned this counsel, and announced that he would\r\ndefend Pesth to the last. The backwardness of the Hungarian preparations\r\nand the disorder of the new levies justified the young general, who from\r\nthis time assumed the attitude of contempt and hostility towards the\r\nCommittee of Defence. Kossuth had in fact been strangely served by fortune\r\nin his choice of Görgei. He had raised him to command on account of one\r\nirretrievable act of severity against an Austrian partisan, and without any\r\nproof of his military capacity. In the untried soldier he had found a\r\ngeneral of unusual skill; in the supposed devotee to Magyar patriotism he\r\nhad found a military politician as self-willed and as insubordinate as any\r\nwho have ever distracted the councils of a falling State. Dissensions and\r\nmisunderstandings aggravated the weakness of the Hungarians in the field.\r\nPosition after position was lost, and it soon became evident that the\r\nParliament and Government could remain no longer at Pesth. They withdrew to\r\nDebreczin beyond the Theiss, and on the 5th of January, 1849, Windischgrätz\r\nmade his entry into the capital. [436]\r\n\r\n[The Hungarian Government at Debreczin.]\r\n\r\n[Kossuth and Görgei.]\r\n\r\nThe Austrians now supposed the war to be at an end. It was in fact but\r\nbeginning. The fortress of Comorn, on the upper Danube, remained in the\r\nhands of the Magyars; and by conducting his retreat northwards into a\r\nmountainous country where the Austrians could not follow him Görgei gained\r\nthe power either of operating against Windischgrätz's communications or of\r\ncombining with the army of General Klapka, who was charged with the defence\r\nof Hungary against an enemy advancing from Galicia. While Windischgrätz\r\nremained inactive at Pesth, Klapka met and defeated an Austrian division\r\nunder General Schlick which had crossed the Carpathians and was moving\r\nsouthwards towards Debreczin. Görgei now threw himself eastwards upon the\r\nline of retreat of the beaten enemy, and Schlick's army only escaped\r\ncapture by abandoning its communications and seeking refuge with\r\nWindischgrätz at Pesth. A concentration of the Magyar forces was effected\r\non the Theiss, and the command over the entire army was given by Kossuth to\r\nDembinski, a Pole who had gained distinction in the wars of Napoleon and in\r\nthe campaign of 1831. Görgei, acting as the representative of the officers\r\nwho had been in the service before the Revolution, had published an address\r\ndeclaring that the army would fight for no cause but that of the\r\nConstitution as established by Ferdinand, the legitimate King, and that it\r\nwould accept no commands but those of the Ministers whom Ferdinand had\r\nappointed. Interpreting this manifesto as a direct act of defiance, and as\r\na warning that the army might under Görgei's command make terms on its own\r\nauthority with the Austrian Government, Kossuth resorted to the dangerous\r\nexperiment of superseding the national commanders by a Pole who was\r\nconnected with the revolutionary party throughout Europe. The act was\r\ndisastrous in its moral effects upon the army; and, as a general, Dembinski\r\nentirely failed to justify his reputation. After permitting Schlick's corps\r\nto escape him he moved forwards from the Theiss against Pesth. He was met\r\nby the Austrians and defeated at Kapolna (February 26). Both armies retired\r\nto their earlier positions, and, after a declaration from the Magyar\r\ngenerals that they would no longer obey his orders, Dembinski was removed\r\nfrom his command, though he remained in Hungary to interfere once more with\r\nevil effect before the end of the war.\r\n\r\n[The Austrians driven out of Hungary, April.]\r\n\r\nThe struggle between Austria and Hungary had reached this stage when the\r\nConstitution merging all provincial rights in one centralised system was\r\npublished by Schwarzenberg. The Croats, the Serbs, the Roumanians, who had\r\nso credulously flocked to the Emperor's banner under the belief that they\r\nwere fighting for their own independence, at length discovered their\r\ndelusion. Their enthusiasm sank; the bolder among them even attempted to\r\ndetach their countrymen from the Austrian cause; but it was too late to\r\nundo what had already been done. Jellacic, now undistinguishable from any\r\nother Austrian general, mocked the politicians of Agram who still babbled\r\nof Croatian autonomy: Stratimirovic, the national leader of the Serbs, sank\r\nbefore his rival the Patriarch of Carlowitz, a Churchman who preferred\r\necclesiastical immunities granted by the Emperor of Austria to independence\r\nwon on the field of battle by his countrymen. Had a wiser or more generous\r\nstatesmanship controlled the Hungarian Government in the first months of\r\nits activity, a union between the Magyars and the subordinate races against\r\nViennese centralisation might perhaps even now have been effected. But\r\ndistrust and animosity had risen too high for the mediators between Slav\r\nand Magyar to attain any real success, nor was any distinct promise of\r\nself-government even now to be drawn from the offers of concession which\r\nwere held out at Debreczin. An interval of dazzling triumph seemed indeed\r\nto justify the Hungarian Government in holding fast to its sovereign\r\nclaims. In the hands of able leaders no task seemed too hard for Magyar\r\ntroops to accomplish. Bem, arriving in Transylvania without a soldier,\r\ncreated a new army, and by a series of extraordinary marches and surprises\r\nnot only overthrew the Austrian and Roumanian troops opposed to him, but\r\nexpelled a corps of Russians whom General Puchner in his extremity had\r\ninvited to garrison Hermannstadt. Görgei, resuming in the first week of\r\nApril the movement in which Dembinski had failed, inflicted upon the\r\nAustrians a series of defeats that drove them back to the walls of Pesth;\r\nwhile Klapka, advancing on Comorn, effected the relief of this fortress,\r\nand planted in the rear of the Austrians a force which threatened to cut\r\nthem off from Vienna. It was in vain that the Austrian Government removed\r\nWindischgrätz from his command. His successor found that a force superior\r\nto his own was gathering round him on every side. He saw that Hungary was\r\nlost; and leaving a garrison in the fortress of Buda, he led off his army\r\nin haste from the capital, and only paused in his retreat when he had\r\nreached the Austrian frontier.\r\n\r\n[Declaration of Hungarian Independence, April 19.]\r\n\r\nThe Magyars, rallying from their first defeats, had brilliantly achieved\r\nthe liberation of their land. The Court of Vienna, attempting in right of\r\nsuperior force to overthrow an established constitution, had proved itself\r\nthe inferior power; and in mingled exaltation and resentment it was natural\r\nthat the party and the leaders who had been foremost in the national\r\nstruggle of Hungary should deem a renewed union with Austria impossible,\r\nand submission to the Hapsburg crown an indignity. On the 19th of April,\r\nafter the defeat of Windischgrätz but before the evacuation of Pesth, the\r\nDiet declared that the House of Hapsburg had forfeited its throne, and\r\nproclaimed Hungary an independent State. No statement was made as to the\r\nfuture form of government, but everything indicated that Hungary, if\r\nsuccessful in maintaining its independence, would become a Republic, with\r\nKossuth, who was now appointed Governor, for its chief. Even in the\r\nrevolutionary severance of ancient ties homage was paid to the legal and\r\nconstitutional bent of the Hungarian mind. Nothing was said in the\r\nDeclaration of April 19th of the rights of man; there was no Parisian\r\ncommonplace on the sovereignty of the people. The necessity of Hungarian\r\nindependence was deduced from the offences which the Austrian House had\r\ncommitted against the written and unwritten law of the land, offences\r\ncontinued through centuries and crowned by the invasion under\r\nWindischgrätz, by the destruction of the Hungarian Constitution in the\r\nedict of March 9th, and by the introduction of the Russians into\r\nTransylvania. Though coloured and exaggerated by Magyar patriotism, the\r\ncharges made against the Hapsburg dynasty were on the whole in accordance\r\nwith historical fact; and if the affairs of States were to be guided by no\r\nother considerations than those relating to the performance of contracts,\r\nHungary had certainly established its right to be quit of partnership with\r\nAustria and of its Austrian sovereign. But the judgment of history has\r\ncondemned Kossuth's declaration of Hungarian independence in the midst of\r\nthe struggle of 1849 as a great political error. It served no useful\r\npurpose; it deepened the antagonism already existing between the Government\r\nand a large part of the army; and while it added to the sources of internal\r\ndiscord, it gave colour to the intervention of Russia as against a\r\nrevolutionary cause. Apart from its disastrous effect upon the immediate\r\ncourse of events, it was based upon a narrow and inadequate view both of\r\nthe needs and of the possibilities of the future. Even in the interests of\r\nthe Magyar nation itself as a European power, it may well be doubted\r\nwhether in severance from Austria such influence and such weight could\r\npossibly have been won by a race numerically weak and surrounded by hostile\r\nnationalities, as the ability and the political energy of the Magyars have\r\nsince won for them in the direction of the accumulated forces of the\r\nAustro-Hungarian Empire.\r\n\r\n[Russian intervention against Hungary.]\r\n\r\nIt has generally been considered a fatal error on the part of the Hungarian\r\ncommanders that, after expelling the Austrian army, they did not at once\r\nmarch upon Vienna, but returned to lay siege to the fortress of Buda, which\r\nresisted long enough to enable the Austrian Government to reorganise and to\r\nmultiply its forces. But the intervention of Russia would probably have\r\nbeen fatal to Hungarian independence, even if Vienna had been captured and\r\na democratic government established there for a while in opposition to the\r\nCourt at Olmütz. The plan of a Russian intervention, though this\r\nintervention was now explained by the community of interest between Polish\r\nand Hungarian rebels, was no new thing. Soon after the outbreak of the\r\nMarch Revolution the Czar had desired to send his troops both into Prussia\r\nand into Austria as the restorers of monarchical authority. His help was\r\ndeclined on behalf of the King of Prussia; in Austria the project had been\r\ndiscussed at successive moments of danger, and after the overthrow of the\r\nImperial troops in Transylvania by Bem the proffered aid was accepted. The\r\nRussians who then occupied Hermannstadt did not, however, enter the country\r\nas combatants; their task was to garrison certain positions still held by\r\nthe Austrians, and so to set free the Emperor's troops for service in the\r\nfield. On the declaration of Hungarian independence, it became necessary\r\nfor Francis Joseph to accept his protector's help without qualification or\r\ndisguise. An army of eighty thousand Russians marched across Galicia to\r\nassist the Austrians in grappling with an enemy before whom, when\r\nsingle-handed, they had succumbed. Other Russian divisions, while Austria\r\nmassed its troops on the Upper Danube, entered Transylvania from the south\r\nand east, and the Magyars in the summer of 1849 found themselves compelled\r\nto defend their country against forces three times more numerous than their\r\nown. [437]\r\n\r\n[The summer campaign in Hungary, July-August, 1849.]\r\n\r\n[Capitulation of Vilagos, August 13.]\r\n\r\n[Vengeance of Austria.]\r\n\r\nWhen it became known that the Czar had determined to throw all his strength\r\ninto the scale, Kossuth saw that no ordinary operations of war could\r\npossibly avert defeat, and called upon his countrymen to destroy their\r\nhomes and property at the approach of the enemy, and to leave to the\r\ninvader a flaming and devastated solitude. But the area of warfare was too\r\nvast for the execution of this design, even if the nation had been prepared\r\nfor so desperate a course. The defence of Hungary was left to its armies,\r\nand Görgei became the leading figure in the calamitous epoch that followed.\r\nWhile the Government prepared to retire to Szegedin, far in the south-east,\r\nGörgei took post on the Upper Danube, to meet the powerful force which the\r\nEmperor of Austria had placed under the orders of General Haynau, a soldier\r\nwhose mingled energy and ferocity in Italy had marked him out as a fitting\r\nscourge for the Hungarians, and had won for him supreme civil as well as\r\nmilitary powers. Görgei naturally believed that the first object of the\r\nAustrian commander would be to effect a junction with the Russians, who,\r\nunder Paskiewitsch, the conqueror of Kars in 1829, were now crossing the\r\nCarpathians; and he therefore directed all his efforts against the left of\r\nthe Austrian line. While he was unsuccessfully attacking the enemy on the\r\nriver Waag north of Comorn, Haynau with the mass of his forces advanced on\r\nthe right bank of the Danube, and captured Raab (June 28th). Görgei threw\r\nhimself southwards, but his efforts to stop Haynau were in vain, and the\r\nAustrians occupied Pesth (July 11th). The Russians meanwhile were advancing\r\nsouthwards by an independent line of march. Their vanguard reached the\r\nDanube and the Upper Theiss, and Görgei seemed to be enveloped by the\r\nenemy. The Hungarian Government adjured him to hasten towards Szegedin and\r\nArad, where Kossuth was concentrating all the other divisions for a final\r\nstruggle; but Görgei held on to his position about Comorn until his retreat\r\ncould only be effected by means of a vast detour northwards, and before he\r\ncould reach Arad all was lost. Dembinski was again in command. Charged with\r\nthe defence of the passage of the Theiss about Szegedin, he failed to\r\nprevent the Austrians from crossing the river, and on the 5th of August was\r\ndefeated at Czoreg with heavy loss. Kossuth now gave the command to Bern,\r\nwho had hurried from Transylvania, where overpowering forces had at length\r\nwrested victory from his grasp. Bern fought the last battle of the campaign\r\nat Temesvar. He was overthrown and driven eastwards, but succeeded in\r\nleading a remnant of his army across the Moldavian frontier and so escaped\r\ncapture. Görgei, who was now close to Arad, had some strange fancy that it\r\nwould dishonour his army to seek refuge on neutral soil. He turned\r\nnorthwards so as to encounter Russian and not Austrian regiments, and\r\nwithout striking a blow, without stipulating even for the lives of the\r\ncivilians in his camp, he led his army within the Russian lines at Vilagos,\r\nand surrendered unconditionally to the generals of the Czar. His own life\r\nwas spared; no mercy was shown to those who were handed over as his\r\nfellow-prisoners by the Russian to the Austrian Government, or who were\r\nseized by Haynau as his troops advanced. Tribunals more resembling those of\r\nthe French Reign of Terror than the Courts of a civilised Government sent\r\nthe noblest patriots and soldiers of Hungary to the scaffold. To the deep\r\ndisgrace of the Austrian Crown, Count Batthyány, the Minister of Ferdinand,\r\nwas included among those whose lives were sacrificed. The vengeance of the\r\nconqueror seemed the more frenzied and the more insatiable because it had\r\nonly been rendered possible by foreign aid. Crushed under an iron rule,\r\nexhausted by war, the prey of a Government which knew only how to employ\r\nits subject-races as gaolers over one another, Hungary passed for some\r\nyears into silence and almost into despair. Every vestige of its old\r\nconstitutional rights was extinguished. Its territory was curtailed by the\r\nseparation of Transylvania and Croatia; its administration was handed over\r\nto Germans from Vienna. A conscription, enforced not for the ends of\r\nmilitary service but as the surest means of breaking the national spirit,\r\nenrolled its youth in Austrian regiments, and banished them to the\r\nextremities of the empire. No darker period was known in the history of\r\nHungary since the wars of the seventeenth century than that which followed\r\nthe catastrophe of 1849. [438]\r\n\r\n[Italian affairs, August, 1848-March, 1849.]\r\n\r\n[Murder of Rossi, Nov. 15. Flight of Pius IX.]\r\n\r\n[Roman Republic, Feb. 9, 1849.]\r\n\r\n[Tuscany.]\r\n\r\nThe gloom which followed Austrian victory was now descending not on Hungary\r\nalone but on Italy also. The armistice made between Radetzky and the King\r\nof Piedmont at Vigevano in August, 1848, lasted for seven months, during\r\nwhich the British and French Governments endeavoured, but in vain, to\r\narrange terms of peace between the combatants. With military tyranny in its\r\nmost brutal form crushing down Lombardy, it was impossible that Charles\r\nAlbert should renounce the work of deliverance to which he had pledged\r\nhimself. Austria, on the other hand, had now sufficiently recovered its\r\nstrength to repudiate the concessions which it had offered at an earlier\r\ntime, and Schwarzenberg on assuming power announced that the Emperor would\r\nmaintain Lombardy at every cost. The prospects of Sardinia as regarded help\r\nfrom the rest of the Peninsula were far worse than when it took up arms in\r\nthe spring of 1848. Projects of a general Italian federation, of a military\r\nunion between the central States and Piedmont, of an Italian Constituent\r\nAssembly, had succeeded one another and left no result. Naples had fallen\r\nback into absolutism; Rome and Tuscany, from which aid might still have\r\nbeen expected, were distracted by internal contentions, and hastening as it\r\nseemed towards anarchy. After the defeat of Charles Albert at Custozza,\r\nPius IX., who was still uneasily playing his part as a constitutional\r\nsovereign, had called to office Pellegrino Rossi, an Italian patriot of an\r\nearlier time, who had since been ambassador of Louis Philippe at Rome, and\r\nby his connection with the Orleanist Monarchy had incurred the hatred of\r\nthe Republican party throughout Italy. Rossi, as a vigorous and independent\r\nreformer, was as much detested in clerical and reactionary circles as he\r\nwas by the demagogues and their followers. This, however, profited him\r\nnothing; and on the 15th of November, as he was proceeding to the opening\r\nof the Chambers, he was assassinated by an unknown hand. Terrified by this\r\ncrime, and by an attack upon his own palace by which it was followed, Pius\r\nfled to Gaeta and placed himself under the protection of the King of\r\nNaples. A Constituent Assembly was summoned and a Republic proclaimed at\r\nRome, between which and the Sardinian Government there was so little\r\ncommunity of feeling that Charles Albert would, if the Pope had accepted\r\nhis protection, have sent his troops to restore him to a position of\r\nsecurity. In Tuscany affairs were in a similar condition. The Grand Duke\r\nhad for some months been regarded as a sincere, though reserved, friend of\r\nthe Italian cause, and he had even spoken of surrendering his crown if this\r\nshould be for the good of the Italian nation. When, however, the Pope had\r\nfled to Gaeta, and the project was openly avowed of uniting Tuscany with\r\nthe Roman States in a Republic, the Grand Duke, moved more by the\r\nfulminations of Pius against his despoilers than by care for his own crown,\r\nfled in his turn, leaving the Republicans masters of Florence. A miserable\r\nexhibition of vanity, riot, and braggadocio was given to the world by the\r\npoliticians of the Tuscan State. Alike in Florence and in Rome all sense of\r\nthe true needs of the moment, of the absolute uselessness of internal\r\nchanges of Government if Austria was to maintain its dominion, seemed to\r\nhave vanished from men's minds. Republican phantoms distracted the heart\r\nand the understanding; no soldier, no military administrator arose till too\r\nlate by the side of the rhetoricians and mob-leaders who filled the stage;\r\nand when, on the 19th of March, the armistice was brought to a close in\r\nUpper Italy, Piedmont took the field alone. [439]\r\n\r\n[The Match campaign, 1849.]\r\n\r\n[Battle of Novara, March 23.]\r\n\r\nThe campaign which now began lasted but for five days. While Charles Albert\r\nscattered his forces from Lago Maggiore to Stradella on the south of the\r\nPo, hoping to move by the northern road upon Milan, Radetzky concentrated\r\nhis troops near Pavia, where he intended to cross the Ticino. In an evil\r\nmoment Charles Albert had given the command of his army to Chrzanowski, a\r\nPole, and had entrusted its southern division, composed chiefly of Lombard\r\nvolunteers, to another Pole, Ramorino, who had been engaged in Mazzini's\r\nincursion into Savoy in 1833. Ramorino had then, rightly or wrongly,\r\nincurred the charge of treachery. His relations with Chrzanowski were of\r\nthe worst character, and the habit of military obedience was as much\r\nwanting to him as the sentiment of loyalty to the sovereign from whom he\r\nhad now accepted a command. The wilfulness of this adventurer made the\r\nPiedmontese army an easy prey. Ramorino was posted on the south of the Po,\r\nnear its junction with the Ticino, but received orders on the commencement\r\nof hostilities to move northwards and defend the passage of the Ticino at\r\nPavia, breaking up the bridges behind him. Instead of obeying this order he\r\nkept his division lingering about Stradella. Radetzky, approaching the\r\nTicino at Pavia, found the passage unguarded. He crossed the river with the\r\nmass of his army, and, cutting off Ramorino's division, threw himself upon\r\nthe flank of the scattered Piedmontese. Charles Albert, whose headquarters\r\nwere at Novara, hurried southwards. Before he could concentrate his troops,\r\nhe was attacked at Mortara by the Austrians and driven back. The line of\r\nretreat upon Turin and Alessandria was already lost; an attempt was made to\r\nhold Novara against the advancing Austrians. The battle which was fought in\r\nfront of this town on the 23rd of March ended with the utter overthrow of\r\nthe Sardinian army. So complete was the demoralisation of the troops that\r\nthe cavalry were compelled to attack bodies of half-maddened infantry in\r\nthe streets of Novara in order to save the town from pillage. [440]\r\n\r\n[Abdication of Charles Albert.]\r\n\r\nCharles Albert had throughout the battle of the 23rd appeared to seek\r\ndeath. The reproaches levelled against him for the abandonment of Milan in\r\nthe previous year, the charges of treachery which awoke to new life the\r\nmiserable record of his waverings in 1821, had sunk into the very depths of\r\nhis being. Weak and irresolute in his earlier political career, harsh and\r\nilliberal towards the pioneers of Italian freedom during a great part of\r\nhis reign, Charles had thrown his whole heart and soul into the final\r\nstruggle of his country against Austria. This struggle lost, life had\r\nnothing more for him. The personal hatred borne towards him by the rulers\r\nof Austria caused him to believe that easier terms of peace might be\r\ngranted to Piedmont if another sovereign were on its throne, and his\r\nresolution, in case of defeat, was fixed and settled. When night fell after\r\nthe battle of Novara he called together his generals, and in their presence\r\nabdicated his crown. Bidding an eternal farewell to his son Victor\r\nEmmanuel, who knelt weeping before him, he quitted the army accompanied by\r\nbut one attendant, and passed unrecognised through the enemy's guards. He\r\nleft his queen, his capital, unvisited as he journeyed into exile. The\r\nbrief residue of his life was spent in solitude near Oporto. Six months\r\nafter the battle of Novara he was carried to the grave.\r\n\r\n[Beginning of Victor Emmanuel's reign.]\r\n\r\nIt may be truly said of Charles Albert that nothing in his reign became him\r\nlike the ending of it. Hopeless as the conflict of 1849 might well appear,\r\nit proved that there was one sovereign in Italy who was willing to stake\r\nhis throne, his life, the whole sum of his personal interests, for the\r\nnational cause; one dynasty whose sons knew no fear save that others should\r\nencounter death before them on Italy's behalf. Had the profoundest\r\nstatesmanship, the keenest political genius, governed the counsels of\r\nPiedmont in 1849, it would, with full prescience of the ruin of Novara,\r\nhave bidden the sovereign and the army strike in self-sacrifice their last\r\nunaided blow. From this time there was but one possible head for Italy. The\r\nfaults of the Government of Turin during Charles Albert's years of peace\r\nhad ceased to have any bearing on Italian affairs; the sharpest tongues no\r\nlonger repeated, the most credulous ear no longer harboured the slanders of\r\n1848; the man who, beaten and outnumbered, had for hours sat immovable in\r\nfront of the Austrian cannon at Novara had, in the depth of his misfortune,\r\ngiven to his son not the crown of Piedmont only but the crown of Italy.\r\nHonour, patriotism, had made the young Victor Emmanuel the hope of the\r\nSardinian army; the same honour and patriotism carried him safely past the\r\nlures which Austria set for the inheritor of a ruined kingdom, and gave in\r\nthe first hours of his reign an earnest of the policy which was to end in\r\nItalian union. It was necessary for him to visit Radetzky in his camp in\r\norder to arrange the preliminaries of peace. There, amid flatteries offered\r\nto him at his father's expense, it was notified to him that if he would\r\nannul the Constitution that his father had made, he might reckon not only\r\non an easy quittance with the conqueror, but on the friendship and support\r\nof Austria. This demand, though strenuously pressed in later negotiations,\r\nVictor Emmanuel unconditionally refused. He had to endure for a while the\r\npresence of Austrian troops in his kingdom, and to furnish an indemnity\r\nwhich fell heavily on so small a State; but the liberties of his people\r\nremained intact, and the pledge given by his father inviolate. Amid the\r\nruin of all hopes and the bankruptcy of all other royal reputations\r\nthroughout Italy, there proved to be one man, one government, in which the\r\nItalian people could trust. This compensation at least was given in the\r\ndisasters of 1849, that the traitors to the cause of Italy and of freedom\r\ncould not again deceive, nor the dream of a federation of princes again\r\nobscure the necessity of a single national government. In the fidelity of\r\nVictor Emmanuel to the Piedmontese Constitution lay the pledge that when\r\nItaly's next opportunity should arrive, the chief would be there who would\r\nmeet the nation's need.\r\n\r\n[Restoration in Tuscany.]\r\n\r\n[Rome and France.]\r\n\r\n[French intervention determined on.]\r\n\r\nThe battle of Novara had not long been fought when the Grand Duke of\r\nTuscany was restored to his throne under an Austrian garrison, and his late\r\ndemocratic Minister, Guerazzi, who had endeavoured by submission to the\r\nCourt-party to avert an Austrian occupation, was sent into imprisonment. At\r\nRome a far bolder spirit was shown. Mazzini had arrived in the first week\r\nof March, and, though his exhortation to the Roman Assembly to forget the\r\noffences of Charles Albert and to unite against the Austrians in Lombardy\r\ncame too late, he was able, as one of a Triumvirate with dictatorial\r\npowers, to throw much of his own ardour into the Roman populace in defence\r\nof their own city and State. The enemy against whom Rome had to be defended\r\nproved indeed to be other than that against whom preparations were being\r\nmade. The victories of Austria had aroused the apprehension of the French\r\nGovernment; and though the fall of Piedmont and Lombardy could not now be\r\nundone, it was determined by Louis Napoleon and his Ministers to anticipate\r\nAustria's restoration of the Papal power by the despatch of French troops\r\nto Rome. All the traditions of French national policy pointed indeed to\r\nsuch an intervention. Austria had already invaded the Roman States from the\r\nnorth, and the political conditions which in 1832 had led so pacific a\r\nminister as Casimir Perier to occupy Ancona were now present in much\r\ngreater force. Louis Napoleon could not, without abandoning a recognised\r\ninterest and surrendering something of the due influence of France, have\r\npermitted Austrian generals to conduct the Pope back to his capital and to\r\nassume the government of Central Italy. If the first impulses of the\r\nRevolution of 1848 had still been active in France, its intervention would\r\nprobably have taken the form of a direct alliance with the Roman Republic;\r\nbut public opinion had travelled far in the opposite direction since the\r\nFour Days of June; and the new President, if he had not forgotten his own\r\nyouthful relations with the Carbonari, was now a suitor for the solid\r\nfavours of French conservative and religious sentiment. His Ministers had\r\nnot recognised the Roman Republic. They were friends, no doubt, to liberty;\r\nbut when it was certain that the Austrians, the Spaniards, the Neapolitans,\r\nwere determined to restore the Pope, it might be assumed that the\r\ncontinuance of the Roman Republic was an impossibility. France, as a\r\nCatholic and at the same time a Liberal Power, might well, under these\r\ncircumstances, address itself to the task of reconciling Roman liberty with\r\nthe inevitable return of the Holy Father to his temporal throne. Events\r\nwere moving too fast for diplomacy; troops must be at once despatched, or\r\nthe next French envoy would find Radetzky on the Tiber. The misgivings of\r\nthe Republican part of the Assembly at Paris were stilled by French\r\nassurances of the generous intentions of the Government towards the Roman\r\npopulations, and of its anxiety to shelter them from Austrian domination,\r\nPresident, Ministers, and generals resolutely shut their eyes to the\r\npossibility that a French occupation of Rome might be resisted by force by\r\nthe Romans themselves; and on the 22nd of April an armament of about ten\r\nthousand men set sail for Civita Vecchia under the command of General\r\nOudinot, a son of the Marshal of that name.\r\n\r\n[The French at Civita Vecchia, April 25, 1849.]\r\n\r\n[Oudinot attacks Rome and is repelled, April 30.]\r\n\r\nBefore landing on the Italian coast, the French general sent envoys to the\r\nauthorities at Civita Vecchia, stating that his troops came as friends, and\r\ndemanding that they should be admitted into the town. The Municipal Council\r\ndetermined not to offer resistance, and the French thus gained a footing on\r\nItalian soil and a basis for their operations. Messages came from French\r\ndiplomatists in Rome encouraging the general to advance without delay. The\r\nmass of the population, it was said, would welcome his appearance; the\r\ndemocratic faction, if reckless, was too small to offer any serious\r\nresistance, and would disappear as soon as the French should enter the\r\ncity. On this point, however, Oudinot was speedily undeceived. In reply to\r\na military envoy who was sent to assure the Triumvirs of the benevolent\r\ndesigns of the French, Mazzini bluntly answered that no reconciliation with\r\nthe Pope was possible; and on the 26th of April the Roman Assembly called\r\nupon the Executive to repel force by force. Oudinot now proclaimed a state\r\nof siege at Civita Vecchia, seized the citadel, and disarmed the garrison.\r\nOn the 28th he began his march on Rome. As he approached, energetic\r\npreparations were made for resistance. Garibaldi, who had fought at the\r\nhead of a free corps against the Austrians in Upper Italy in 1848, had now\r\nbrought some hundreds of his followers to Rome. A regiment of Lombard\r\nvolunteers, under their young leader Manara, had escaped after the\r\ncatastrophe of Novara, and had come to fight for liberty in its last\r\nstronghold on Italian soil. Heroes, exiles, desperadoes from all parts of\r\nthe Peninsula, met in the streets of Rome, and imparted to its people a\r\nvigour and resolution of which the world had long deemed them incapable.\r\nEven the remnant of the Pontifical Guard took part in the work of defence.\r\nOudinot, advancing with his little corps of seven thousand men, found\r\nhimself, without heavy artillery, in front of a city still sheltered by its\r\nancient fortifications, and in the presence of a body of combatants more\r\nresolute than his own troops and twice as numerous. He attacked on the\r\n30th, was checked at every point, and compelled to retreat towards Civita\r\nVecchia, leaving two hundred and fifty prisoners in the hands of the enemy.\r\n[441]\r\n\r\n[French policy, April-May.]\r\n\r\nInsignificant as was this misfortune of the French arms, it occasioned no\r\nsmall stir in Paris and in the Assembly. The Government, which had declared\r\nthat the armament was intended only to protect Rome against Austria, was\r\nvehemently reproached for its duplicity, and a vote was passed demanding\r\nthat the expedition should not be permanently diverted from the end\r\nassigned to it. Had the Assembly not been on the verge of dissolution it\r\nwould probably have forced upon the Government a real change of policy. A\r\ngeneral election, however, was but a few days distant, and until the result\r\nof this election should be known the Ministry determined to temporise. M.\r\nLesseps, since famous as the creator of the Suez Canal, was sent to Rome\r\nwith instructions to negotiate for some peaceable settlement. More honest\r\nthan his employers, Lesseps sought with heart and soul to fulfil his task.\r\nWhile he laboured in city and camp, the French elections for which the\r\nPresident and Ministers were waiting took place, resulting in the return of\r\na Conservative and reactionary majority. The new Assembly met on the 28th\r\nof May. In the course of the next few days Lesseps accepted terms proposed\r\nby the Roman Government, which would have precluded the French from\r\nentering Rome. Oudinot, who had been in open conflict with the envoy\r\nthroughout his mission, refused his sanction to the treaty, and the\r\naltercations between the general and the diplomatist were still at their\r\nheight when despatches arrived from Paris announcing that the powers given\r\nto Lesseps were at an end, and ordering Oudinot to recommence hostilities.\r\nThe pretence of further negotiation would have been out of place with the\r\nnew Parliament. On the 4th of June the French general, now strongly\r\nreinforced, occupied the positions necessary for a regular siege of Rome.\r\n\r\n[Attempted insurrection in France, June 13.]\r\n\r\n[The French enter Rome, July 3.]\r\n\r\nAgainst the forces now brought into action it was impossible that the Roman\r\nRepublic could long defend itself. One hope remained, and that was in a\r\nrevolution within France itself. The recent elections had united on the one\r\nside all Conservative interests, on the other the Socialists and all the\r\nmore extreme factions of the Republican party. It was determined that a\r\ntrial of strength should first be made within the Assembly itself upon the\r\nRoman question, and that, if the majority there should stand firm, an\r\nappeal should be made to insurrection. Accordingly on the 11th of June,\r\nafter the renewal of hostilities had been announced in Paris, Ledru Rollin\r\ndemanded the impeachment of the Ministry. His motion was rejected, and the\r\nsignal was given for an outbreak not only in the capital but in Lyons and\r\nother cities. But the Government were on their guard, and it was in vain\r\nthat the resources of revolution were once more brought into play. General\r\nChangarnier suppressed without bloodshed a tumult in Paris on June 13th;\r\nand though fighting took place at Lyons, the insurrection proved feeble in\r\ncomparison with the movements of the previous year. Louis Napoleon and his\r\nMinistry remained unshaken, and the siege of Rome was accordingly pressed\r\nto its conclusion. Oudinot, who at the beginning of the month had carried\r\nthe positions held by the Roman troops outside the walls, opened fire with\r\nheavy artillery on the 14th. The defence was gallantly sustained by\r\nGaribaldi and his companions until the end of the month, when the breaches\r\nmade in the walls were stormed by the enemy, and further resistance became\r\nimpossible. The French made their entry into Rome on the 3rd of July,\r\nGaribaldi leading his troops northwards in order to prolong the struggle\r\nwith the Austrians who were now in possession of Bologna, and, if possible,\r\nto reach Venice, which was still uncaptured. Driven to the eastern coast\r\nand surrounded by the enemy, he was forced to put to sea. He landed again,\r\nbut only to be hunted over mountain and forest. His wife died by his side.\r\nRescued by the devotion of Italian patriots, he made his escape to Piedmont\r\nand thence to America, to reappear in all the fame of his heroic deeds and\r\nsufferings at the next great crisis in the history of his country.\r\n\r\n[The restored Pontifical Government.]\r\n\r\nIt had been an easy task for a French army to conquer Rome; it was not so\r\neasy for the French Government to escape from the embarrassments of its\r\nvictory. Liberalism was still the official creed of the Republic, and the\r\nprotection of the Roman population from a reaction under Austrian auspices\r\nhad been one of the alleged objects of the Italian expedition. No\r\nstipulation had, however, been made with the Pope during the siege as to\r\nthe future institutions of Rome; and when, on the 14th of July, the\r\nrestorations of Papal authority was formally announced by Oudinot, Pius and\r\nhis Minister Antonelli still remained unfettered by any binding engagement.\r\nNor did the Pontiff show the least inclination to place himself in the\r\npower of his protectors. He remained at Gaeta, sending a Commission of\r\nthree Cardinals to assume the government of Rome. The first acts of the\r\nCardinals dispelled any illusion that the French might have formed as to\r\nthe docility of the Holy See. In the presence of a French Republican army\r\nthey restored the Inquisition, and appointed a Board to bring to trial all\r\nofficials compromised in the events that had taken place since the murder\r\nof Rossi in November, 1848. So great was the impression made on public\r\nopinion by the action of the Cardinals that Louis Napoleon considered it\r\nwell to enter the lists in person on behalf of Roman liberty; and in a\r\nletter to Colonel Ney, a son of the Marshal, he denounced in language of\r\ngreat violence the efforts that were being made by a party antagonistic to\r\nFrance to base the Pope's return upon proscription and tyranny. Strong in\r\nthe support of Austria and the other Catholic Powers, the Papal Government\r\nat Gaeta received this menace with indifference, and even made the\r\ndiscourtesy of the President a ground for withholding concessions. Of the\r\nre-establishment of the Constitution granted by Pius in 1848 there was now\r\nno question; all that the French Ministry could hope was to save some\r\nfragments in the general shipwreck of representative government, and to\r\navert the vengeance that seemed likely to fall upon the defeated party. A\r\nPontifical edict, known as the Motu Proprio, ultimately bestowed upon the\r\nmunicipalities certain local powers, and gave to a Council, nominated by\r\nthe Pope from among the persons chosen by the municipalities, the right of\r\nconsultation on matters of finance. More than this Pius refused to grant,\r\nand when he returned to Rome it was as an absolute sovereign. In its\r\nefforts on behalf of the large body of persons threatened with prosecution\r\nthe French Government was more successful. The so-called amnesty which was\r\npublished by Antonelli with the Motu Proprio seemed indeed to have for its\r\nobject the classification of victims rather than the announcement of\r\npardon; but under pressure from the French the excepted persons were\r\ngradually diminished in number, and all were finally allowed to escape\r\nother penalties by going into exile. To those who were so driven from their\r\nhomes Piedmont offered a refuge.\r\n\r\n[Fall of Venice, Aug. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Sicily conquered by Ferdinand, April, May.]\r\n\r\nThus the pall of priestly absolutism and misrule fell once more over the\r\nRoman States, and the deeper the hostility of the educated classes to the\r\nrestored power the more active became the system of repression. For liberty\r\nof person there was no security whatever, and, though the offences of 1848\r\nwere now professedly amnestied, the prisons were soon thronged with persons\r\narrested on indefinite charges and detained for an unlimited time without\r\ntrial. Nor was Rome more unfortunate in its condition than Italy generally.\r\nThe restoration of Austrian authority in the north was completed by the\r\nfall of Venice. For months after the subjugation of the mainland, Venice,\r\nwhere the Republic had again been proclaimed and Manin had been recalled to\r\npower, had withstood all the efforts of the Emperor's forces. Its hopes had\r\nbeen raised by the victories of the Hungarians, which for a moment seemed\r\nalmost to undo the catastrophe of Novara. But with the extinction of all\r\npossibility of Hungarian aid the inevitable end came in view. Cholera and\r\nfamine worked with the enemy; and a fortnight after Görgei had laid down\r\nhis arms at Vilagos the long and honourable resistance of Venice ended with\r\nthe entry of the Austrians (August 25th). In the south, Ferdinand of Naples\r\nwas again ruling as despot throughout the full extent of his dominions.\r\nPalermo, which had struck the first blow for freedom in 1848, had soon\r\nafterwards become the seat of a Sicilian Parliament, which deposed the\r\nBourbon dynasty and offered the throne of Sicily to the younger brother of\r\nVictor Emmanuel. To this Ferdinand replied by a fleet to Messina, which\r\nbombarded that city for five days and laid a great part of it in ashes. His\r\nviolence caused the British and French fleets to interpose, and hostilities\r\nwere suspended until the spring of 1849, the Western Powers ineffectually\r\nseeking to frame some compromise acceptable at once to the Sicilians and to\r\nthe Bourbon dynasty. After the triumph of Radetzky at Novara and the\r\nrejection by the Sicilian Parliament of the offer of a separate\r\nconstitution and administration for the island, Ferdinand refused to remain\r\nany longer inactive. His fleet and army moved southwards from Messina, and\r\na victory won at the foot of Mount Etna over the Sicilian forces, followed\r\nby the capture of Catania, brought the struggle to a close. The Assembly at\r\nPalermo dispersed, and the Neapolitan troops made their entry into the\r\ncapital without resistance on the 15th of May. It was in vain that Great\r\nBritain now urged Ferdinand to grant to Sicily the liberties which he had\r\nhitherto professed himself willing to bestow. Autocrat he was, and autocrat\r\nhe intended to remain. On the mainland the iniquities practised by his\r\nagents seem to have been even worse than in Sicily, where at least some\r\nattempt was made to use the powers of the State for the purposes of\r\nmaterial improvement. For those who had incurred the enmity of Ferdinand's\r\nGovernment there was no law and no mercy. Ten years of violence and\r\noppression, denounced by the voice of freer lands, had still to be borne by\r\nthe subjects of this obstinate tyrant ere the reckoning-day arrived, and\r\nthe deeply rooted jealousy between Sicily and Naples, which had wrought so\r\nmuch ill to the cause of Italian freedom, was appeased by the fall of the\r\nBourbon throne. [442]\r\n\r\n[Germany from May, 1848.]\r\n\r\n[The National Assembly at Frankfort.]\r\n\r\n[Archduke John chosen Administrator, June 29.]\r\n\r\nWe have thus far traced the stages of conflict between the old monarchical\r\norder and the forces of revolution in the Austrian empire and in that\r\nMediterranean land whose destiny was so closely interwoven with that of\r\nAustria. We have now to pass back into Germany, and to resume the history\r\nof the German revolution at the point where the national movement seemed to\r\nconcentrate itself in visible form, the opening of the Parliament of\r\nFrankfort on the 18th of May, 1848. That an Assembly representing the\r\nentire German people, elected in unbounded enthusiasm and comprising within\r\nit nearly every man of political or intellectual eminence who sympathised\r\nwith the national cause, should be able to impose its will upon the\r\ntottering Governments of the individual German States, was not an unnatural\r\nbelief in the circumstances of the moment. No second Chamber represented\r\nthe interests of the ruling Houses, nor had they within the Assembly itself\r\nthe organs for the expression of their own real or unreal claims. With all\r\nthe freedom of a debating club or of a sovereign authority like the French\r\nConvention, the Parliament of Frankfort entered upon its work of moulding\r\nGermany afresh, limited only by its own discretion as to what it should\r\nmake matter of consultation with any other power. There were thirty-six\r\nGovernments in Germany, and to negotiate with each of these on the future\r\nConstitution might well seem a harder task than to enforce a Constitution\r\non all alike. In the creation of a provisional executive authority there\r\nwas something of the same difficulty. Each of the larger States might, if\r\nconsulted, resist the selection of a provisional chief from one of its\r\nrivals; and though the risk of bold action was not denied, the Assembly, on\r\nthe instance of its President, Von Gagern, a former Minister of\r\nHesse-Darmstadt, resolved to appoint an Administrator of the Empire by a\r\ndirect vote of its own. The Archduke John of Austria, long known as an\r\nenemy of Metternich's system of repression and as a patron of the idea of\r\nGerman union, was chosen Administrator, and he accepted the office. Prussia\r\nand the other States acquiesced in the nomination, though the choice of a\r\nHapsburg prince was unpopular with the Prussian nation and army, and did\r\nnot improve the relations between the Frankfort Assembly and the Court of\r\nBerlin. [443] Schmerling, an Austrian, was placed at the head of the\r\nArchduke's Ministry.\r\n\r\n[The National Assembly. May-Sept.]\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of a Constitution for Germany the Assembly could draw\r\nlittle help from the work of legislators in other countries. Belgium, whose\r\ninstitutions were at once recent and successful, was not a Federal State;\r\nthe founders of the American Union had not had to reckon with four kings\r\nand to include in their federal territory part of the dominions of an\r\nemperor. Instead of grappling at once with the formidable difficulties of\r\npolitical organisation, the Committee charged with the drafting of a\r\nConstitution determined first to lay down the principles of civil right\r\nwhich were to be the basis of the German commonwealth. There was something\r\nof the scientific spirit of the Germans in thus working out the\r\nsubstructure of public law on which all other institutions were to rest;\r\nmoreover, the remembrance of the Decrees of Carlsbad and of the other\r\nexceptional legislation from which Germany had so heavily suffered excited\r\na strong demand for the most solemn guarantees against arbitrary departure\r\nfrom settled law in the future. Thus, regardless of the absence of any\r\nmaterial power by which its conclusions were to be enforced, the Assembly,\r\nin the intervals between its stormy debates on the politics of the hour,\r\ntraced with philosophic thoroughness the consequences of the principles of\r\npersonal liberty and of equality before the law, and fashioned the order of\r\na modern society in which privileges of class, diversity of jurisdictions,\r\nand the trammels of feudalism on industrial life were alike swept away.\r\nFour months had passed, and the discussion of the so-called Primary Rights\r\nwas still unfinished, when the Assembly was warned by an outbreak of\r\npopular violence in Frankfort itself of the necessity of hastening towards\r\na constitutional settlement.\r\n\r\n[The Armistice of Malmö, Aug. 26.]\r\n\r\n[Outrages at Frankfort, Sept. 18.]\r\n\r\nThe progress of the insurrection in Schleswig-Holstein against Danish\r\nsovereignty had been watched with the greatest interest throughout Germany;\r\nand in the struggle of these provinces for their independence the rights\r\nand the honour of the German nation at large were held to be deeply\r\ninvolved. As the representative of the Federal authority, King Frederick\r\nWilliam of Prussia had sent his troops into Holstein, and they arrived\r\nthere in time to prevent the Danish army from following up its first\r\nsuccesses and crushing the insurgent forces. Taking up the offensive,\r\nGeneral Wrangel at the head of the Prussian troops succeeded in driving the\r\nDanes out of Schleswig, and at the beginning of May he crossed the border\r\nbetween Schleswig and Jutland and occupied the Danish fortress of\r\nFredericia. His advance into purely Danish territory occasioned the\r\ndiplomatic intervention of Russia and Great Britain; and, to the deep\r\ndisappointment of the German nation and its Parliament, the King of Prussia\r\nordered his general to retire into Schleswig. The Danes were in the\r\nmeantime blockading the harbours and capturing the merchant-vessels of the\r\nGermans, as neither Prussia nor the Federal Government possessed a fleet of\r\nwar. For some weeks hostilities were irresolutely continued in Schleswig,\r\nwhile negotiations were pursued in foreign capitals and various forms of\r\ncompromise urged by foreign Powers. At length, on the 26th of August, an\r\narmistice of seven months was agreed upon at Malmö in Sweden by the\r\nrepresentatives of Denmark and Prussia, the Court of Copenhagen refusing to\r\nrecognise the German central Government at Frankfort or to admit its envoy\r\nto the conferences. The terms of this armistice, when announced in Germany,\r\nexcited the greatest indignation, inasmuch as they declared all the acts of\r\nthe Provisional Government of Schleswig-Holstein null and void, removed all\r\nGerman troops from the Duchies, and handed over their government during the\r\nduration of the armistice to a Commission of which half the members were to\r\nbe appointed by the King of Denmark. Scornfully as Denmark had treated the\r\nAssembly of Frankfort, the terms of the armistice nevertheless required its\r\nsanction. The question was referred to a committee, which, under the\r\ninfluence of the historian Dahlmann, himself formerly an official in\r\nHolstein, pronounced for the rejection of the treaty. The Assembly, in a\r\nscene of great excitement, resolved that the execution of the measures\r\nattendant on the armistice should be suspended. The Ministry in consequence\r\nresigned, and Dahlmann was called upon to replace it by one under his own\r\nleadership. He proved unable to do so. Schmerling resumed office, and\r\ndemanded that the Assembly should reverse its vote. Though in severance\r\nfrom Prussia the Central Government had no real means of carrying on a war\r\nwith Denmark, the most passionate opposition was made to this demand. The\r\narmistice was, however, ultimately ratified by a small majority. Defeated\r\nin the Assembly, the leaders of the extreme Democratic faction allied\r\nthemselves with the populace of Frankfort, which was ready for acts of\r\nviolence. Tumultuous meetings were held; the deputies who had voted for the\r\narmistice were declared traitors to Germany. Barricades were erected, and\r\nalthough the appearance of Prussian troops prevented an assault from being\r\nmade on the Assembly, its members were attacked in the streets, and two of\r\nthem murdered by the mob (Sept. 17th). A Republican insurrection was once\r\nmore attempted in Baden, but it was quelled without difficulty. [444]\r\n\r\n[Berlin, April-Sept., 1848.]\r\n\r\nThe intervention of foreign Courts on behalf of Denmark had given\r\nostensible ground to the Prussian Government for not pursuing the war with\r\ngreater resolution; but though the fear of Russia undoubtedly checked King\r\nFrederick William, this was not the sole, nor perhaps the most powerful\r\ninfluence that worked upon him. The cause of Schleswig-Hulstein was, in\r\nspite of its legal basis, in the main a popular and a revolutionary one,\r\nand between the King of Prussia and the revolution there was an intense and\r\na constantly deepening antagonism. Since the meeting of the National\r\nAssembly at Berlin on the 22nd of May the capital had been the scene of an\r\nalmost unbroken course of disorder. The Assembly, which was far inferior in\r\nability and character to that of Frankfort, soon showed itself unable to\r\nresist the influence of the populace. On the 8th of June a resolution was\r\nmoved that the combatants in the insurrection of March deserved well of\r\ntheir country. Had this motion been carried the King would have dissolved\r\nthe Assembly: it was outvoted, but the mob punished this concession to the\r\nfeelings of the monarch by outrages upon the members of the majority. A\r\nCivic Guard was enrolled from citizens of the middle class, but it proved\r\nunable to maintain order, and wholly failed to acquire the political\r\nimportance which was gained by the National Guard of Paris after the\r\nrevolution of 1830. Exasperated by their exclusion from service in the\r\nGuard, the mob on the 14th of June stormed an arsenal and destroyed the\r\ntrophies of arms which they found there. Though violence reigned in the\r\nstreets the Assembly rejected a proposal for declaring the inviolability of\r\nits members, and placed itself under the protection of the citizens of\r\nBerlin. King Frederick William had withdrawn to Potsdam, where the leaders\r\nof reaction gathered round him. He detested his Constitutional Ministers,\r\nwho, between a petulant king and a suspicious Parliament, were unable to\r\neffect any useful work and soon found themselves compelled to relinquish\r\ntheir office. In Berlin the violence of the working classes, the\r\ninterruption of business, the example of civil war in Paris, inclined men\r\nof quiet disposition to a return to settled government at any price.\r\nMeasures brought forward by the new Ministry for the abolition of the\r\npatrimonial jurisdictions, the hunting-rights and other feudal privileges\r\nof the greater landowners, occasioned the organisation of a league for the\r\ndefence of property, which soon became the focus of powerful conservative\r\ninterests. Above all, the claims of the Archduke John, as Administrator of\r\nthe Empire, to the homage of the army, and the hostile attitude assumed\r\ntowards the army by the Prussian Parliament itself, exasperated the\r\nmilitary class and encouraged the king to venture on open resistance. A\r\ntumult having taken place at Schweidnitz in Silesia, in which several\r\npersons were shot by the soldiery, the Assembly, pending an investigation\r\ninto the circumstances, demanded that the Minister of War should publish an\r\norder requiring the officers of the army to work with the citizens for the\r\nrealisation of Constitutional Government; and it called upon all officers\r\nnot loyally inclined to a Constitutional system to resign their commissions\r\nas a matter of honour. Denying the right of the Chamber to act as a\r\nmilitary executive, the Minister of War refused to publish the order\r\nrequired. The vote was repeated, and in the midst of threatening\r\ndemonstrations in the streets the Ministry resigned (Sept. 7th). [445]\r\n\r\n[The Prussian army.]\r\n\r\n[Count Brandenburg Minister, Nov. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Prorogation of the Prussian Assembly, Nov. 9.]\r\n\r\nIt had been the distinguishing feature of the Prussian revolution that the\r\narmy had never for a moment wavered in its fidelity to the throne. The\r\nsuccess of the insurrection of March 18th had been due to the paucity of\r\ntroops and the errors of those in command, not to any military disaffection\r\nsuch as had paralysed authority in Paris and in the Mediterranean States.\r\nEach affront offered to the army by the democratic majority in the Assembly\r\nsupplied the King with new weapons; each slight passed upon the royal\r\nauthority deepened the indignation of the officers. The armistice of Malmö\r\nbrought back to the neighbourhood of the capital a general who was longing\r\nto crush the party of disorder, and regiments on whom he could rely; but\r\nthough there was now no military reason for delay, it was not until the\r\ncapture of Vienna by Windischgrätz had dealt a fatal blow at democracy in\r\nGermany that Frederick William determined to have done with his own\r\nmutinous Parliament and the mobs by which it was controlled. During\r\nSeptember and October the riots and tumults in the streets of Berlin\r\ncontinued. The Assembly, which had rejected the draft of a Constitution\r\nsubmitted to it by the Cabinet, debated the clauses of one drawn up by a\r\nCommittee of its own members, abolished nobility, orders and titles, and\r\nstruck out from the style of the sovereign the words that described him as\r\nKing by the Grace of God. When intelligence arrived in Berlin that the\r\nattack of Windischgrätz upon Vienna had actually begun, popular passion\r\nredoubled. The Assembly was besieged by an angry crowd, and a resolution in\r\nfavour of the intervention of Prussia was brought forward within the House.\r\nThis was rejected, and it was determined instead to invoke the mediation of\r\nthe Central Government at Frankfort between the Emperor and his subjects.\r\nBut the decision of the Assembly on this and every other point was now\r\nmatter of indifference. Events outstripped its deliberations, and with the\r\nfall of Vienna its own course was run. On the 2nd of November the King\r\ndismissed his Ministers and called to office the Count of Brandenburg, a\r\nnatural son of Frederick William II., a soldier in high command, and one of\r\nthe most outspoken representatives of the monarchical spirit of the army.\r\nThe meaning of the appointment was at once understood. A deputation from\r\nthe Assembly conveyed its protest to the King at Potsdam. The King turned\r\nhis back upon them without giving an answer, and on the 9th of November an\r\norder was issued proroguing the Assembly, and bidding it to meet on the\r\n27th at Brandenburg, not at Berlin.\r\n\r\n[Last days of the Prussian Assembly.]\r\n\r\n[Dissolution of the Assembly, Dec. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Prussian Constitution granted by edict.]\r\n\r\nThe order of prorogation, as soon as signed by the King was brought into\r\nthe Assembly by the Ministers, who demanded that it should be obeyed\r\nimmediately and without discussion. The President allowing a debate to\r\ncommence, the Ministers and seventy-eight Conservative deputies left the\r\nHall. The remaining deputies, two hundred and eighty in number, then passed\r\na resolution declaring that they would not meet at Brandenburg; that the\r\nKing had no power to remove, to prorogue, or to dissolve the Assembly\r\nwithout its own consent; and that the Ministers were unfit to hold office.\r\nThis challenge was answered by a proclamation of the Ministers declaring\r\nthe further meeting of the deputies illegal, and calling upon the Civic\r\nGuard not to recognise them as a Parliament. On the following day General\r\nWrangel and his troops entered Berlin and surrounded the Assembly Hall. In\r\nreply to the protests of the President, Wrangel answered that the\r\nParliament had been prorogued and must disappear. The members peaceably\r\nleft the Hall, but reassembled at another spot that they had selected in\r\nanticipation of expulsion; and for some days they were pursued by the\r\nmilitary from one place of meeting to another. On the 15th of November they\r\npassed a resolution declaring the expenditure of state funds and the\r\nraising of taxes by the Government to be illegal so long as the Assembly\r\nshould not be permitted to continue its deliberations. The Ministry on its\r\npart showed that it was determined not to brook resistance. The Civic Guard\r\nwas dissolved and ordered to surrender its arms. It did so without striking\r\na blow, and vanished from the scene, a memorable illustration of the\r\npolitical nullity of the middle class in Berlin as compared with that of\r\nParis. The state of siege was proclaimed, the freedom of the Press and the\r\nright of public meeting were suspended. On the 27th of November a portion\r\nof the Assembly appeared, according to the King's order, at Brandenburg,\r\nbut the numbers present were not sufficient for the transaction of\r\nbusiness. The presence of the majority, however, was not required, for the\r\nKing had determined to give no further legal opportunities to the men who\r\nhad defied him. Treating the vote of November 15th as an act of rebellion\r\non the part of those concerned in it, the King dissolved the Assembly\r\n(December 5th), and conferred upon Prussia a Constitution drawn up by his\r\nown advisers, with the promise that this Constitution should be subject to\r\nrevision by the future representative body. Though the dissolution of the\r\nAssembly occasioned tumults in Breslau and Cologne it was not actively\r\nresented by the nation at large. The violence of the fallen body during its\r\nlast weeks of existence had exposed it to general discredit; its vote of\r\nthe 15th of November had been formally condemned by the Parliament of\r\nFrankfort; and the liberal character of the new Constitution, which agreed\r\nin the main with the draft-Constitution produced by the Committee of the\r\nAssembly, disposed moderate men to the belief that in the conflict between\r\nthe King and the popular representatives the fault had not been on the side\r\nof the sovereign.\r\n\r\n[The Frankfort Parliament and Austria, Oct.-Dec.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Parliament of Frankfort, warned against longer delay by\r\nthe disturbances of September 17th, had addressed itself in earnest to the\r\nsettlement of the Federal Constitution of Germany. Above a host of minor\r\ndifficulties two great problems confronted it at the outset. The first was\r\nthe relation of the Austrian Empire, with its partly German and partly\r\nforeign territory, to the German national State; the other was the nature\r\nof the headship to be established. As it was clear that the Austrian\r\nGovernment could not apply the public law of Germany to its Slavic and\r\nHungarian provinces, it was enacted in the second article of the Frankfort\r\nConstitution that where a German and a non-German territory had the same\r\nsovereign, the relation between these countries must be one of purely\r\npersonal union under the sovereign, no part of Germany being incorporated\r\ninto a single State with any non-German land. At the time when this article\r\nwas drafted the disintegration of Austria seemed more probable than the\r\nre-establishment of its unity; no sooner, however, had Prince Schwarzenberg\r\nbeen brought into power by the subjugation of Vienna, than he made it plain\r\nthat the government of Austria was to be centralised as it had never been\r\nbefore. In the first public declaration of his policy he announced that\r\nAustria would maintain its unity and permit no exterior influence to modify\r\nits internal organisation; that the settlement of the relations between\r\nAustria and Germany could only be effected after each had gained some new\r\nand abiding political form; and that in the meantime Austria would continue\r\nto fulfil its duties as a confederate. [446] The interpretation put upon\r\nthis statement at Frankfort was that Austria, in the interest of its own\r\nunity, preferred not to enter the German body, but looked forward to the\r\nestablishment of some intimate alliance with it at a future time. As the\r\nCourt of Vienna had evidently determined not to apply to itself the second\r\narticle of the Constitution, and an antagonism between German and Austrian\r\npolicy came within view, Schmerling, as an Austrian subject, was induced to\r\nresign his office, and was succeeded in it by Gagern, hitherto President of\r\nthe Assembly (Dec. 16th). [447]\r\n\r\n[The Frankfort Parliament and Austria, Dec., Jan.]\r\n\r\nIn announcing the policy of the new Ministry, Gagern assumed the exclusion\r\nof Austria from the German Federation. Claiming for the Assembly, as the\r\nrepresentative of the German nation, sovereign power in drawing up the\r\nConstitution, he denied that the Constitution could be made an object of\r\nnegotiation with Austria. As Austria refused to fulfil the conditions of\r\nthe second article, it must remain outside the Federation; the Ministry\r\ndesired, however, to frame some close and special connection between\r\nAustria and Germany, and asked for authority to negotiate with the Court of\r\nVienna for this purpose. Gagern's declaration of the exclusion of Austria\r\noccasioned a vehement and natural outburst of feeling among the Austrian\r\ndeputies, and was met by their almost unanimous protest. Some days later\r\nthere arrived a note from Schwarzenberg which struck at the root of all\r\nthat had been done and all that was claimed by the Assembly. Repudiating\r\nthe interpretation that had been placed upon his words, Schwarzenberg\r\ndeclared that the affairs of Germany could only be settled by an\r\nunderstanding between the Assembly and the Courts, and by an arrangement\r\nwith Austria, which was the recognised chief of the Governments and\r\nintended to remain so in the new Federation. The question of the inclusion\r\nor exclusion of Austria now threw into the shade all the earlier\r\ndifferences between parties in the Assembly. A new dividing-line was drawn.\r\nOn the one side appeared a group composed of the Austrian representatives,\r\nof Ultramontanes who feared a Protestant ascendency if Austria should be\r\nexcluded, and of deputies from some of the smaller States who had begun to\r\ndread Prussian domination. On the other side was the great body of\r\nrepresentatives who set before all the cause of German national union, who\r\nsaw that this union would never be effected in any real form if it was made\r\nto depend upon negotiations with the Austrian Court, and who held, with the\r\nMinister, that to create a true German national State without the Austrian\r\nprovinces was better than to accept a phantom of complete union in which\r\nthe German people should be nothing and the Cabinet of Vienna everything.\r\nThough coalitions and intrigues of parties obscured the political prospect\r\nfrom day to day, the principles of Gagern were affirmed by a majority of\r\nthe Assembly, and authority to negotiate some new form of connection with\r\nAustria, as a power outside the Federation, was granted to the Ministry.\r\n\r\n[The Federal Headship.]\r\n\r\n[King Frederick William IV. elected Emperor, March 28.]\r\n\r\nThe second great difficulty of the Assembly was the settlement of the\r\nFederal headship. Some were for a hereditary Emperor, some for a President\r\nor Board, some for a monarchy alternating between the Houses of Prussia and\r\nAustria, some for a sovereign elected for life or for a fixed period. The\r\nfirst decision arrived at was that the head should be one of the reigning\r\nprinces of Germany, and that he should bear the title of Emperor. Against\r\nthe hereditary principle there was a strong and, at first, a successful\r\nopposition. Reserving for future discussion other questions relating to the\r\nimperial office, the Assembly passed the Constitution through the first\r\nreading on February 3rd, 1849. It was now communicated to all the German\r\nGovernments, with the request that they would offer their opinions upon it.\r\nThe four minor kingdoms--Saxony, Hanover, Bavaria, and Würtemberg--with one\r\nconsent declared against any Federation in which Austria should not be\r\nincluded; the Cabinet of Vienna protested against the subordination of the\r\nEmperor of Austria to a central power vested in any other German prince,\r\nand proposed that the entire Austrian Empire, with its foreign as well as\r\nits German elements, should enter the Federation. This note was enough to\r\nprove that Austria was in direct conflict with the scheme of national union\r\nwhich the Assembly had accepted; but the full peril of the situation was\r\nnot perceived till on the 9th of March Schwarzenberg published the\r\nConstitution of Olmütz, which extinguished all separate rights throughout\r\nthe Austrian Empire, and confounded in one mass, as subjects of the Emperor\r\nFrancis Joseph, Hungarians, Germans, Slavs and Italians. The import of the\r\nAustrian demand now stood out clear and undisguised. Austria claimed to\r\nrange itself with a foreign population of thirty millions within the German\r\nFederation; in other words, to reduce the German national union to a\r\npartnership with all the nationalities of Central Europe, to throw the\r\nweight of an overwhelming influence against any system of free\r\nrepresentative government, and to expose Germany to war where no interests\r\nbut those of the Pole or the Magyar might be at stake. So deep was the\r\nimpression made at Frankfort by the fall of the Kremsier Parliament and the\r\npublication of Schwarzenberg's unitary edict, that one of the most eminent\r\nof the politicians who had hitherto opposed the exclusion of Austria--the\r\nBaden deputy Welcker--declared that further persistence in this course\r\nwould be treason to Germany. Ranging himself with the Ministry, he\r\nproposed that the entire German Constitution, completed by a hereditary\r\nchieftainship, should be passed at a single vote on the second reading, and\r\nthat the dignity of Emperor should be at once offered to the King of\r\nPrussia. Though the Assembly declined to pass the Constitution by a single\r\nvote, it agreed to vote upon clause by clause without discussion. The\r\nhereditary principle was affirmed by the narrow majority of four in a House\r\nof above five hundred. The second reading of the Constitution was completed\r\non the 27th of March, and on the following day the election of the\r\nsovereign took place. Two hundred and ninety votes were given for the King\r\nof Prussia. Two hundred and forty-eight members, hostile to the hereditary\r\nprinciple or to the prince selected, abstained from voting. [448]\r\n\r\n[Frederick William IV.]\r\n\r\nFrederick William had from early years cherished the hope of seeing some\r\ncloser union of Germany established under Prussian influence. But he dwelt\r\nin a world where there was more of picturesque mirage than of real insight.\r\nHe was almost superstitiously loyal to the House of Austria; and he failed\r\nto perceive, what was palpable to men of far inferior endowments to his\r\nown, that by setting Prussia at the head of the constitutional movement of\r\nthe epoch he might at any time from the commencement of his reign have\r\nrallied all Germany round it. Thus the revolution of 1848 burst upon him,\r\nand he was not the man to act or to lead in time of revolution. Even in\r\n1848, had he given promptly and with dignity what, after blood had been\r\nshed in his streets, he had to give with humiliation, he would probably\r\nhave been acclaimed Emperor on the opening of the Parliament of Frankfort,\r\nand have been accepted by the universal voice of Germany. But the odium\r\ncast upon him by the struggle of March 18th was so great that in the\r\nelection of a temporary Administrator of the Empire in June no single\r\nmember at Frankfort gave him a vote. Time was needed to repair his credit,\r\nand while time passed Austria rose from its ruins. In the spring of 1849\r\nFrederick William could not have assumed the office of Emperor of Germany\r\nwithout risk of a war with Austria, even had he been willing to accept this\r\noffice on the nomination of the Frankfort Parliament. But to accept the\r\nImperial Crown from a popular Assembly was repugnant to his deepest\r\nconvictions. Clear as the Frankfort Parliament had been, as a whole, from\r\nthe taint of Republicanism or of revolutionary violence, it had\r\nnevertheless had its birth in revolution: the crown which it offered would,\r\nin the King's expression, have been picked up from blood and mire. Had the\r\nprinces of Germany by any arrangement with the Assembly tendered the crown\r\nto Frederick William the case would have been different; a new Divine right\r\nwould have emanated from the old, and conditions fixed by negotiation\r\nbetween the princes and the popular Assembly might have been endured. That\r\nFrederick William still aspired to German leadership in one form or another\r\nno one doubted; his disposition to seek or to reject an accommodation with\r\nthe Frankfort Parliament varied with the influences which surrounded him.\r\nThe Ministry led by the Count of Brandenburg, though anti-popular in its\r\ndomestic measures, was desirous of arriving at some understanding with\r\nGagern and the friends of German union. Shortly before the first reading of\r\nthe Constitution at Frankfort, a note had been drafted in the Berlin\r\nCabinet admitting under certain provisions the exclusion of Austria from\r\nthe Federation, and proposing, not that the Assembly should admit the right\r\nof each Government to accept or reject the Constitution, but that it should\r\nmeet in a fair spirit such recommendations as all the Governments together\r\nshould by a joint act submit to it. This note, which would have rendered an\r\nagreement between the Prussian Court and the Assembly possible, Frederick\r\nWilliam at first refused to sign. He was induced to do so (Jan. 23rd) by\r\nhis confidant Bunsen, who himself was authorised to proceed to Frankfort.\r\nDuring Bunsen's absence despatches arrived at Berlin from Schwarzenberg,\r\nwho, in his usual resolute way, proposed to dissolve the Frankfort\r\nAssembly, and to divide Germany between Austria, Prussia, and the four\r\nsecondary kingdoms. Bunsen on his return found his work undone; the King\r\nrecoiled under Austrian pressure from the position which he had taken up,\r\nand sent a note to Frankfort on the 16th of February, which described\r\nAustria as a necessary part of Germany and claimed for each separate\r\nGovernment the right to accept or reject the Constitution as it might think\r\nfit. Thus the acceptance of the headship by Frederick William under any\r\nconditions compatible with the claims of the Assembly was known to be\r\ndoubtful when, on the 28th of March, the majority resolved to offer him the\r\nImperial Crown. The disposition of the Ministry at Berlin was indeed still\r\nfavourable to an accommodation; and when, on the 2nd of April, the members\r\nof the Assembly who were charged to lay its offer before Frederick William\r\narrived at Berlin, they were received with such cordiality by Brandenburg\r\nthat it was believed the King's consent had been won.\r\n\r\n[Frederick William IV. refuses the Crown, April 3.]\r\n\r\nThe reply of the King to the deputation on the following day rudely\r\ndispelled these hopes. He declared that before he could accept the Crown\r\nnot only must he be summoned to it by the Princes of Germany, but the\r\nconsent of all the Governments must be given to the Constitution. In other\r\nwords, he required that the Assembly should surrender its claims to\r\nlegislative supremacy, and abandon all those parts of the Federal\r\nConstitution of which any of the existing Governments disapproved. As it\r\nwas certain that Austria and the four minor kingdoms would never agree to\r\nany Federal union worthy of the name, and that the Assembly could not now,\r\nwithout renouncing its past, admit that the right of framing the\r\nConstitution lay outside itself, the answer of the King was understood to\r\namount to a refusal. The deputation left Berlin in the sorrowful conviction\r\nthat their mission had failed; and a note which was soon afterwards\r\nreceived at Frankfort from the King showed that this belief was\r\ncorrect. [449]\r\n\r\n[The Frankfort Constitution rejected by the Governments.]\r\n\r\nThe answer of King Frederick William proved indeed much more than that he\r\nhad refused the Crown of Germany; it proved that he would not accept the\r\nConstitution which the Assembly had enacted. The full import of this\r\ndetermination, and the serious nature of the crisis now impending over\r\nGermany, were at once understood. Though twenty-eight Governments\r\nsuccessively accepted the Constitution, these were without exception petty\r\nStates, and their united forces would scarcely have been a match for one of\r\nits more powerful enemies. On the 5th of April the Austrian Cabinet\r\ndeclared the Assembly to have been guilty of illegality in publishing the\r\nConstitution, and called upon all Austrian deputies to quit Frankfort. The\r\nPrussian Lower Chamber, elected under the King's recent edict, having\r\nprotested against the state of siege in Berlin, and having passed a\r\nresolution in favour of the Frankfort Constitution, was forthwith\r\ndissolved. Within the Frankfort Parliament the resistance of Governments\r\nexcited a patriotic resentment and caused for the moment a union of\r\nparties. Resolutions were passed declaring that the Assembly would adhere\r\nto the Constitution. A Committee was charged with the ascertainment of\r\nmeasures to be adopted for enforcing its recognition; and a note was\r\naddressed to all the hostile Governments demanding that they should abstain\r\nfrom proroguing or dissolving the representative bodies within their\r\ndominions with the view of suppressing the free utterance of opinions in\r\nfavour of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n[End of the German National Assembly, June, 1849.]\r\n\r\nOn the ground of this last demand the Prussian official Press now began to\r\ndenounce the Assembly of Frankfort as a revolutionary body. The situation\r\nof affairs daily became worse. It was in vain that the Assembly appealed to\r\nthe Governments, the legislative Chambers, the local bodies, the whole\r\npeople, to bring the Constitution into effect. The moral force on which it\r\nhad determined to rely proved powerless, and in despair of conquering the\r\nGovernments by public opinion the more violent members of the democratic\r\nparty determined to appeal to insurrection. On the 4th of May a popular\r\nrising began at Dresden, where the King, under the influence of Prussia,\r\nhad dismissed those of his Ministers who urged him to accept the\r\nConstitution, and had dissolved his Parliament. The outbreak drove the King\r\nfrom his capital; but only five days had passed when a Prussian army-corps\r\nentered the city and crushed the rebellion. In this interval, short as it\r\nwas, there had been indications that the real leaders of the insurrection\r\nwere fighting not for the Frankfort Constitution but for a Republic, and\r\nthat in the event of their victory a revolutionary Government, connected\r\nwith French and Polish schemes of subversion, would come into power. In\r\nBaden this was made still clearer. There the Government of the Grand Duke\r\nhad actually accepted the Frankfort Constitution, and had ordered elections\r\nto be held for the Federal legislative body by which the Assembly was to be\r\nsucceeded. Insurrection nevertheless broke out. The Republic was openly\r\nproclaimed; the troops joined the insurgents; and a Provisional Government\r\nallied itself with a similar body that had sprung into being with the help\r\nof French and Polish refugees in the neighbouring Palatinate. Conscious\r\nthat these insurrections must utterly ruin its own cause, the Frankfort\r\nAssembly on the suggestion of Gagern called upon the Archduke John to\r\nsuppress them by force of arms, and at the same time to protect the free\r\nexpression of opinion on behalf of the Constitution where threatened by\r\nGovernments. John, who had long clung to his office only to further the\r\nends of Austria, refused to do so, and Gagern in consequence resigned. With\r\nhis fall ended the real political existence of the Assembly. In reply to a\r\nresolution which it passed on the 10th of May, calling upon John to employ\r\nall the forces of Germany in defence of the Constitution, the Archduke\r\nplaced a mock-Ministry in office. The Prussian Government, declaring the\r\nvote of the 10th of May to be a summons to civil war, ordered all Prussian\r\ndeputies to withdraw from the Assembly, and a few days later its example\r\nwas imitated by Saxony and Hanover. On the 20th of May sixty-five of the\r\nbest known of the members, including Arndt and Dahlmann, placed on record\r\ntheir belief that in the actual situation the relinquishment of the task of\r\nthe Assembly was the least of evils, and declared their work at Frankfort\r\nended. Other groups followed them till there remained only the party of the\r\nextreme Left, which had hitherto been a weak minority, and which in no\r\nsense represented the real opinions of Germany. This Rump-Parliament,\r\ntroubling itself little with John and his Ministers, determined to withdraw\r\nfrom Frankfort, where it dreaded the appearance of Prussian troops, into\r\nWürtemberg, where it might expect some support from the revolutionary\r\nGovernments of Baden and the Palatinate. On the 6th of June a hundred and\r\nfive deputies assembled at Stuttgart. There they proceeded to appoint a\r\ngoverning Committee for all Germany, calling upon the King of Würtemberg to\r\nsupply them with seven thousand soldiers, and sending out emissaries to\r\nstir up the neighbouring population. But the world disregarded them. The\r\nGovernment at Stuttgart, after an interval of patience, bade them begone;\r\nand on the 18th of June their hall was closed against them and they were\r\ndispersed by troops, no one raising a hand on their behalf. The overthrow\r\nof the insurgents who had taken up arms in Baden and the Palatinate was not\r\nso easy a matter. A campaign of six weeks was necessary, in which the army\r\nof Prussia, led by the Prince of Prussia, sustained some reverses, before\r\nthe Republican levies were crushed, and with the fall of Rastadt the\r\ninsurrection was brought to a close. [450]\r\n\r\n[The Baden insurrection suppressed, July, 1849.]\r\n\r\n[Prussia attempts to form a separate union.]\r\n\r\nThe end of the German Parliament, on which the nation had set such high\r\nhopes and to which it had sent so much of what was noblest in itself,\r\ncontrasted lamentably with the splendour of its opening. Whether a better\r\nresult would have been attained if, instead of claiming supreme authority\r\nin the construction of Federal union, the Assembly had from the first\r\nsought the co-operation of the Governments, must remain matter of\r\nconjecture. Austria would under all circumstances have been the great\r\nhindrance in the way; and after the failure of the efforts made at\r\nFrankfort to establish the general union of Germany, Austria was able\r\ncompletely to frustrate the attempts which were now made at Berlin to\r\nestablish partial union upon a different basis. In notifying to the\r\nAssembly his refusal of the Imperial Crown, King Frederick William had\r\nstated that he was resolved to place himself at the head of a Federation to\r\nbe formed by States voluntarily uniting with him under terms to be\r\nsubsequently arranged; and in a circular note addressed to the German\r\nGovernments he invited such as were disposed to take counsel with Prussia\r\nto unite in Conference at Berlin. The opening of the Conference was fixed\r\nfor the 17th of May. Two days before this the King issued a proclamation to\r\nthe Prussian people announcing that in spite of the failure of the Assembly\r\nof Frankfort a German union was still to be formed. When the Conference\r\nopened at Berlin, no envoys appeared but those of Austria, Saxony, Hanover,\r\nand Bavaria. The Austrian representative withdrew at the end of the first\r\nsitting, the Bavarian rather later, leaving Prussia to lay such foundations\r\nas it could for German unity with the temporising support of Saxony and\r\nHanover. A confederation was formed, known as the League of the Three\r\nKingdoms. An undertaking was given that a Federal Parliament should be\r\nsummoned, and that a Constitution should be made jointly by this Parliament\r\nand the Governments (May 26th). On the 11th of June the draft of a Federal\r\nConstitution was published. As the King of Prussia was apparently acting in\r\ngood faith, and the draft-Constitution in spite of some defects seemed to\r\nafford a fair basis for union, the question now arose among the leaders of\r\nthe German national movement whether the twenty-eight States which had\r\naccepted the ill-fated Constitution of Frankfort ought or ought not to\r\nenter the new Prussian League. A meeting of a hundred and fifty ex-members\r\nof the Frankfort Parliament was held at Gotha; and although great\r\nindignation was expressed by the more democratic faction, it was determined\r\nthat the scheme now put forward by Prussia deserved a fair trial. The whole\r\nof the twenty-eight minor States consequently entered the League, which\r\nthus embraced all Germany with the exception of Austria, Bavaria and\r\nWürtemberg. But the Courts of Saxony and Hanover had from the first been\r\nacting with duplicity. The military influence of Prussia, and the fear\r\nwhich they still felt of their own subjects, had prevented them from\r\noffering open resistance to the renewed work of Federation; but they had\r\nthroughout been in communication with Austria, and were only waiting for\r\nthe moment when the complete restoration of Austria's military strength\r\nshould enable them to display their true colours. During the spring of\r\n1849, while the Conferences at Berlin were being held, Austria was still\r\noccupied with Hungary and Venice. The final overthrow of these enemies\r\nenabled it to cast its entire weight upon Germany. The result was seen in\r\nthe action of Hanover and Saxony, which now formally seceded from the\r\nFederation. Prussia thus remained at the end of 1849 with no support but\r\nthat of the twenty-eight minor States. Against it, in open or in tacit\r\nantagonism to the establishment of German unity in any effective form, the\r\nfour secondary Kingdoms stood ranged by the side of Austria.\r\n\r\n[Prussia in 1849.]\r\n\r\n[The Union Parliament at Erfurt, March 1850.]\r\n\r\nIt was not until the 20th of March, 1850, that the Federal Parliament,\r\nwhich had been promised ten months before on the incorporation of the new\r\nLeague, assembled at Erfurt. In the meantime reaction had gone far in many\r\na German State. In Prussia, after the dissolution of the Lower Chamber on\r\nApril 27th, 1849, the King had abrogated the electoral provisions of the\r\nConstitution so recently granted by himself, and had substituted for them a\r\nsystem based on the representation of classes. Treating this act as a\r\nbreach of faith, the Democratic party had abstained from voting at the\r\nelections, with the result that in the Berlin Parliament of 1850\r\nConservatives, Reactionists, and officials formed the great majority. The\r\nrevision of the Prussian Constitution, promised at first as a concession to\r\nLiberalism, was conducted in the opposite sense. The King demanded the\r\nstrengthening of monarchical power; the Feudalists, going far beyond him,\r\nattacked the municipal and social reforms of the last two years, and sought\r\nto lead Prussia back to the system of its mediæval estates. It was in the\r\nmidst of this victory of reaction in Prussia that the Federal Parliament at\r\nErfurt began its sittings. Though the moderate Liberals, led by Gagern and\r\nother tried politicians of Frankfurt, held the majority in both Houses, a\r\nstrong Absolutist party from Prussia confronted them, and it soon became\r\nclear that the Prussian Government was ready to play into the hands of this\r\nparty. The draft of the Federal Constitution, which had been made at\r\nBerlin, was presented, according to the undertaking of May 28th, 1849, to\r\nthe Erfurt Assembly. Aware of the gathering strength of the reaction and of\r\nthe danger of delay, the Liberal majority declared itself ready to pass the\r\ndraft into law without a single alteration. The reactionary minority\r\ndemanded that a revision should take place; and, to the scandal of all who\r\nunderstood the methods or the spirit of Parliamentary rule, the Prussian\r\nMinisters united with the party which demanded alterations in the project\r\nwhich they themselves had brought forward. A compromise was ultimately\r\neffected; but the action of the Court of Prussia and the conduct of its\r\nMinisters throughout the Erfurt debates struck with deep despondency those\r\nwho had believed that Frederick William might still effect the work in\r\nwhich the Assembly of Frankfort had failed. The trust in the King's\r\nsincerity or consistence of purpose sank low. The sympathy of the national\r\nLiberal party throughout Germany was to a great extent alienated from\r\nPrussia; while, if any expectation existed at Berlin that the adoption of a\r\nreactionary policy would disarm the hostility of the Austrian Government to\r\nthe new League, this hope was wholly vain and baseless. [451]\r\n\r\n[Action of Austria.]\r\n\r\nAustria had from the first protested against the attempt of the King of\r\nPrussia to establish any new form of union in Germany, and had declared\r\nthat it would recognise none of the conclusions of the Federal Parliament\r\nof Erfurt. According to the theory now advanced by the Cabinet of Vienna\r\nthe ancient Federal Constitution of Germany was still in force. All that\r\nhad happened since March, 1848, was so much wanton and futile\r\nmischief-making. The disturbance of order had at length come to an end, and\r\nwith the exit of the rioters the legitimate powers re-entered into their\r\nrights. Accordingly, there could be no question of the establishment of new\r\nLeagues. The old relation of all the German States to one another under the\r\nascendency of Austria remained in full strength; the Diet of Frankfort,\r\nwhich had merely suspended its functions and by no means suffered\r\nextinction, was still the legitimate central authority. That some\r\nmodifications might be necessary in the ancient Constitution was the most\r\nthat Austria was willing to admit. This, however, was an affair not for the\r\nGerman people but for its rulers, and Austria accordingly invited all the\r\nGovernments to a Congress at Frankfort where the changes necessary might be\r\ndiscussed. In reply to this summons, Prussia strenuously denied that the\r\nold Federal Constitution was still in existence. The princes of the\r\nnumerous petty States which were included in the new Union assembled at\r\nBerlin round Frederick William, and resolved that they would not attend the\r\nConference at Frankfort except under reservations and conditions which\r\nAustria would not admit. Arguments and counter-arguments were exchanged;\r\nbut the controversy between an old and a new Germany was one to be decided\r\nby force of will or force of arms, not by political logic. The struggle was\r\nto be one between Prussia and Austria, and the Austrian Cabinet had well\r\ngauged the temper of its opponent. A direct summons to submission would\r\nhave roused all the King's pride, and have been answered by war. Before\r\ndemanding from Frederick William the dissolution of the Union which he had\r\nfounded, Schwarzenberg determined to fix upon a quarrel in which the King\r\nshould be perplexed or alarmed at the results of his own policy. The\r\ndominant conviction in the mind of Frederick William was that of the\r\nsanctity of monarchical rule. If the League of Berlin could be committed to\r\nsome enterprise hostile to monarchical power, and could be charged with an\r\nalliance with rebellion, Frederick William would probably falter in his\r\nresolutions, and a resort to arms, for which, however, Austria was well\r\nprepared, would become unnecessary. [452]\r\n\r\n[Hesse-Cassel.]\r\n\r\n[The Diet of Frankfort restored, Sept., 1850.]\r\n\r\n[Prussia and Austria.]\r\n\r\n[The Warsaw meeting, Oct. 29, 1850.]\r\n\r\n[Manteuffel at Olmütz, Nov. 29.]\r\n\r\nAmong the States whose Governments had been forced by public opinion to\r\njoin the new Federation was the Electorate of Hesse-Cassel. The Elector\r\nwas, like his predecessors, a thorough despot at heart, and chafed under\r\nthe restrictions which a constitutional system imposed upon his rule.\r\nActing under Austrian instigation, he dismissed his Ministers in the spring\r\nof 1850, and placed in office one Hassenpflug, a type of the worst and most\r\nviolent class of petty tyrants produced by the officialism of the minor\r\nGerman States. Hassenpflug immediately quarrelled with the Estates at\r\nCassel, and twice dissolved them, after which he proceeded to levy taxes by\r\nforce. The law-courts declared his acts illegal; the officers of the army,\r\nwhen called on for assistance, began to resign. The conflict between the\r\nMinister and the Hessian population was in full progress when, at the\r\nbeginning of September, Austria with its vassal Governments proclaimed the\r\nre-establishment of the Diet of Frankfort. Though Prussia and most of the\r\ntwenty-eight States confederate with it treated this announcement as null\r\nand void, the Diet, constituted by the envoys of Austria, the four minor\r\nKingdoms, and a few seceders from the Prussian Union, commenced its\r\nsittings. To the Diet the Elector of Hesse forthwith appealed for help\r\nagainst his subjects, and the decision was given that the refusal of the\r\nHessian Estates to grant the taxes was an offence justifying the\r\nintervention of the central power. Fortified by this judgment, Hassenpflug\r\nnow ordered that every person offering resistance to the Government should\r\nbe tried by court-martial. He was baffled by the resignation of the entire\r\nbody of officers in the Hessian army; and as this completed the\r\ndiscomfiture of the Elector, the armed intervention of Austria, as\r\nidentified with the Diet of Frankfort, now became a certainty. But to the\r\nprotection of the people of Hesse in their constitutional rights Prussia,\r\nas chief of the League which Hesse had joined, stood morally pledged. It\r\nremained for the King to decide between armed resistance to Austria or the\r\nhumiliation of a total abandonment of Prussia's claim to leadership in any\r\nGerman union. Conflicting influences swayed the King in one direction and\r\nanother. The friends of Austria and of absolutism declared that the\r\nemployment of the Prussian army on behalf of the Hessians would make the\r\nKing an accomplice of revolution: the bolder and more patriotic spirits\r\nprotested against the abdication of Prussia's just claims and the evasion\r\nof its responsibilities towards Germany. For a moment the party of action,\r\nled by the Prince of Prussia, gained the ascendant. General Radowitz, the\r\nprojector of the Union, was called to the Foreign Ministry, and Prussian\r\ntroops entered Hesse. Austria now ostentatiously prepared for war.\r\nFrederick William, terrified by the danger confronting him, yet unwilling\r\nto yield all, sought the mediation of the Czar of Russia. Nicholas came\r\nto Warsaw, where the Emperor of Austria and Prince Charles, brother of\r\nthe King of Prussia, attended by the Ministers of their States, met him.\r\nThe closest family ties united the Courts of St. Petersburg and Berlin\r\nbut the Russian sovereign was still the patron of Austria as he had been\r\nin the Hungarian campaign. He resented the action of Prussia in\r\nSchleswig-Holstein, and was offended that King Frederick William had not\r\npresented himself at Warsaw in person. He declared in favour of all\r\nAustria's demands, and treated Count Brandenburg with such indignity that\r\nthe Count, a high-spirited patriot, never recovered from its effect. He\r\nreturned to Berlin only to give in his report and die. Manteuffel,\r\nMinister of the Interior, assured the King that the Prussian army was so\r\nweak in numbers and so defective in organisation that, if it took the\r\nfield against Austria and its allies, it would meet with certain ruin.\r\nBavarian troops, representing the Diet of Frankfort, now entered Hesse at\r\nAustria's bidding, and stood face to face with the Prussians. The moment\r\nhad come when the decision must be made between peace and war. At a\r\nCouncil held at Berlin on November and the peace-party carried the King\r\nwith them. Radowitz gave up office; Manteuffel, the Minister of\r\nrepression within and of submission without, was set at the head of the\r\nGovernment. The meaning of his appointment was well understood, and with\r\neach new proof of the weakness of the King the tone of the Court of\r\nAustria became more imperious. On the 9th of November Schwarzenberg\r\ncategorically demanded the dissolution of the Prussian Union, the\r\nrecognition of the Federal Diet, and the evacuation of Hesse by the\r\nPrussian troops. The first point was at once conceded, and in hollow,\r\nequivocating language Manteuffel made the fact known to the members of\r\nthe Confederacy. The other conditions not being so speedily fulfilled,\r\nSchwarzenberg set Austrian regiments in motion, and demanded the\r\nwithdrawal of the Prussian troops from Hesse within twenty-four hours.\r\nManteuffel begged the Austrian Minister for an interview, and, without\r\nwaiting for an answer, set out for Olmütz. His instructions bade him to\r\npress for certain concessions; none of these did he obtain, and he made\r\nthe necessary submission without them. On the 29th of November a convention\r\nwas signed at Olmütz, in which Prussia recognised the German Federal\r\nConstitution of 1815 as still existing, undertook to withdraw all its\r\ntroops from Hesse with the exception of a single battalion, and consented\r\nto the settlement of affairs both in Hesse and in Schleswig-Holstein by the\r\nFederal Diet. One point alone in the scheme of the Austrian statesman was\r\nwanting among the fruits of his victory at Olmütz and of the negotiations\r\nat Dresden by which this was followed. Schwarzenberg had intended that the\r\nentire Austrian Empire should enter the German Federation; and if he had\r\nhad to reckon with no opponents but the beaten and humbled Prussia, he\r\nwould have effected his design. But the prospect of a central European\r\nPower, with a population of seventy millions, controlled as this would\r\nvirtually be by the Cabinet of Vienna, alarmed other nations. England\r\ndeclared that such a combination would undo the balance of power in Europe\r\nand menace the independence of Germany; France protested in more\r\nthreatening terms; and the project fell to the ground, to be remembered\r\nonly as the boldest imagination of a statesman for whom fortune, veiling\r\nthe Nemesis in store, seemed to set no limit to its favours.\r\n\r\n[Schleswig-Holstein.]\r\n\r\n[The German National Fleet sold by auction, June, 1852.]\r\n\r\nThe cause of Schleswig-Holstein, so intimately bound up with the efforts of\r\nthe Germans towards national union, sank with the failure of these efforts;\r\nand in the final humiliation of Prussia it received what might well seem\r\nits death-blow. The armistice of Malmö, which was sanctioned by the\r\nAssembly of Frankfort in the autumn of 1848, lasted until March 26th, 1849.\r\nWar was then recommenced by Prussia, and the lines of Düppel were stormed\r\nby its troops, while the volunteer forces of Schleswig-Holstein\r\nunsuccessfully laid siege to Fredericia. Hostilities had continued for\r\nthree months, when a second armistice, to last for a year, and\r\nPreliminaries of Peace, were agreed upon. At the conclusion of this\r\narmistice, in July, 1850, Prussia, in the name of Germany, made peace with\r\nDenmark. The inhabitants of the Duchies in consequence continued the war\r\nfor themselves, and though defeated with great loss at Idstedt on the 24th\r\nof July, they remained unconquered at the end of the year. This was the\r\nsituation of affairs when Prussia, by the Treaty of Olmütz, agreed that the\r\nrestored Federal Diet should take upon itself the restoration of order in\r\nSchleswig-Holstein, and that the troops of Prussia should unite with those\r\nof Austria to enforce its decrees. To the Cabinet of Vienna, the foe in\r\nequal measure of German national union and of every democratic cause, the\r\nSchleswig-Holsteiners were simply rebels in insurrection against their\r\nSovereign. They were required by the Diet, under Austrian dictation, to lay\r\ndown their arms; and commissioners from Austria and Prussia entered the\r\nDuchies to compel them to do so. Against Denmark, Austria, and Prussia\r\ntogether, it was impossible for Schleswig-Holstein to prolong its\r\nresistance. The army was dissolved, and the Duchies were handed over to the\r\nKing of Denmark, to return to the legal status which was defined in the\r\nTreaties of Peace. This was the nominal condition of the transfer; but the\r\nDanish Government treated Schleswig as part of its national territory, and\r\nin the northern part of the Duchy the process of substituting Danish for\r\nGerman nationality was actively pursued. The policy of foreign Courts,\r\nlittle interested in the wish of the inhabitants, had from the beginning of\r\nthe struggle of the Duchies against Denmark favoured the maintenance and\r\nconsolidation of the Danish Kingdom. The claims of the Duke of\r\nAugustenburg, as next heir to the Duchies in the male line, were not\r\nconsidered worth the risk of a new war; and by a protocol signed at London\r\non the 2nd of August, 1850, the Powers, with the exception of Prussia,\r\ndeclared themselves in favour of a single rule of succession in all parts\r\nof the Danish State. By a Treaty of the 8th of May, 1852, to which Prussia\r\ngave its assent, the pretensions of all other claimants to the disputed\r\nsuccession were set aside, and Prince Christian, of the House of\r\nGlücksburg, was declared heir to the throne, the rights of the German\r\nFederation as established by the Treaties of 1815 being reserved. In spite\r\nof this reservation of Federal rights, and of the stipulations in favour of\r\nSchleswig and Holstein made in the earlier agreements, the Duchies appeared\r\nto be now practically united with the Danish State. Prussia, for a moment\r\ntheir champion, had joined with Austria in coercing their army, in\r\ndissolving their Government, in annulling the legislation by which the\r\nParliament of Frankfort had made them participators in public rights\r\nthenceforward to be the inheritance of all Germans. A page in the national\r\nhistory was obliterated; Prussia had turned its back on its own\r\nprofessions; there remained but one relic from the time when the whole\r\nGerman people seemed so ardent for the emancipation of its brethren beyond\r\nthe frontier. The national fleet, created by the Assembly of Frankfort for\r\nthe prosecution of the struggle with Denmark, still lay at the mouth of the\r\nElbe. But the same power which had determined that Germany was not to be a\r\nnation had also determined that it could have no national maritime\r\ninterests. After all that had passed, authority had little call to be nice\r\nabout appearances; and the national fleet was sold by auction, in\r\naccordance with a decree of the restored Diet of Frankfort, in the summer\r\nof 1852. [453]\r\n\r\n[Germany after 1849.]\r\n\r\nIt was with deep disappointment and humiliation that the Liberals of\r\nGermany, and all in whom the hatred of democratic change had not\r\noverpowered the love of country, witnessed the issue of the movement of\r\n1848. In so far as that movement was one directed towards national union it\r\nhad totally failed, and the state of things that had existed before 1848\r\nwas restored without change. As a movement of constitutional and social\r\nreform, it had not been so entirely vain; nor in this respect can it be\r\nsaid that Germany after the year 1848 returned altogether to what it was\r\nbefore it. Many of the leading figures of the earlier time re-appeared\r\nindeed with more or less of lustre upon the stage. Metternich though\r\nexcluded from office by younger men, beamed upon Vienna with the serenity\r\nof a prophet who had lived to see most of his enemies shot and of a martyr\r\nwho had returned to one of the most enviable Salons in Europe. No dynasty\r\nlost its throne, no class of the population had been struck down with\r\nproscription as were the clergy and the nobles of France fifty years\r\nbefore. Yet the traveller familiar with Germany before the revolution found\r\nthat much of the old had now vanished, much of a new world come into being.\r\nIt was not sought by the re-established Governments to undo at one stroke\r\nthe whole of the political, the social, the agrarian legislation of the\r\npreceding time, as in some other periods of reaction. The nearest approach\r\nthat was made to this was in a decree of the Diet annulling the Declaration\r\nof Rights drawn up by the Frankfort Assembly, and requiring the Governments\r\nto bring into conformity with the Federal Constitution all laws and\r\ninstitutions made since the beginning of 1848. Parliamentary government was\r\nthereby enfeebled, but not necessarily extinguished. Governments narrowed\r\nthe franchise, curtailed the functions of representative assemblies, filled\r\nthese with their creatures, coerced voters at elections; but, except in\r\nAustria, there was no open abandonment of constitutional forms. In some\r\nStates, as in Saxony under the reactionary rule of Count Beust, the system\r\nof national representation established in 1848 was abolished and the\r\nearlier Estates were revived; in Prussia the two Houses of Parliament\r\ncontinued in existence, but in such dependence upon the royal authority,\r\nand under such strong pressure of an aristocratic and official reaction,\r\nthat, after struggling for some years in the Lower House, the Liberal\r\nleaders at length withdrew in despair. The character which Government now\r\nassumed in Prussia was indeed far more typical of the condition of Germany\r\nat large than was the bold and uncompromising despotism of Prince\r\nSchwarzenberg in Austria. Manteuffel, in whom the Prussian epoch of\r\nreaction was symbolised, was not a cruel or a violent Minister; but his\r\nrule was stamped with a peculiar and degrading meanness, more irritating to\r\nthose who suffered under it than harsher wrong. In his hands government was\r\na thing of eavesdropping and espionage, a system of petty persecution, a\r\nschool of subservience and hypocrisy. He had been the instrument at Olmütz\r\nof such a surrender of national honour and national interests as few\r\nnations have ever endured with the chances of war still untried. This\r\nsurrender may, in the actual condition of the Prussian army, have been\r\nnecessary, but the abasement of it seemed to cling to Manteuffel and to\r\nlower all his conceptions of government. Even where the conclusions of his\r\npolicy were correct they seemed to have been reached by some unworthy\r\nprocess. Like Germany at large, Prussia breathed uneasily under an\r\noppression which was everywhere felt and yet was hard to define. Its best\r\nelements were those which suffered the most: its highest intellectual and\r\npolitical aims were those which most excited the suspicion of the\r\nGovernment. Its King had lost whatever was stimulating or elevated in his\r\nillusions. From him no second alliance with Liberalism, no further effort\r\non behalf of German unity, was to be expected: the hope for Germany and for\r\nPrussia, if hope there was, lay in a future reign.\r\n\r\n[Austria after 1851.]\r\n\r\n[Austrian Concordat, Sept. 18, 1855.]\r\n\r\nThe powerlessness of Prussia was the measure of Austrian influence and\r\nprestige. The contrast presented by Austria in 1848 and Austria in 1851 was\r\nindeed one that might well arrest political observers. Its recovery had no\r\ndoubt been effected partly by foreign aid, and in the struggle with the\r\nMagyars a dangerous obligation had been incurred towards Russia; but\r\nscarred and riven as the fabric was within, it was complete and imposing\r\nwithout. Not one of the enemies who in 1848 had risen against the Court of\r\nVienna now remained standing. In Italy, Austria had won back what had\r\nappeared to be hopelessly lost; in Germany it had more than vindicated its\r\nold claims. It had thrown its rival to the ground, and the full measure of\r\nits ambition was perhaps even yet not satisfied. \"First to humiliate\r\nPrussia, then to destroy it,\" was the expression in which Schwarzenberg\r\nsummed up his German policy. Whether, with his undoubted firmness and\r\ndaring, the Minister possessed the intellectual qualities and the\r\nexperience necessary for the successful administration of an Empire built\r\nup, as Austria now was, on violence and on the suppression of every\r\nnational force, was doubted even by his admirers. The proof, however, was\r\nnot granted to him, for a sudden death carried him off in his fourth year\r\nof power (April 5th, 1852). Weaker men succeeded to his task. The epoch of\r\nmilitary and diplomatic triumph was now ending, the gloomier side of the\r\nreaction stood out unrelieved by any new succession of victories. Financial\r\ndisorder grew worse and worse. Clericalism claimed its bond from the\r\nmonarchy which it had helped to restore. In the struggle of the\r\nnationalities of Austria against the central authority the Bishops had on\r\nthe whole thrown their influence on to the side of the Crown. The restored\r\ndespotism owed too much to their help and depended too much on their\r\ncontinued goodwill to be able to refuse their demands. Thus the new\r\ncentralised administration, reproducing in general the uniformity of\r\ngovernment attempted by the Emperor Joseph II., contrasted with this in its\r\nsubservience to clerical power. Ecclesiastical laws and jurisdictions were\r\nallowed to encroach on the laws and jurisdiction of the State; education\r\nwas made over to the priesthood; within the Church itself the bishops were\r\nallowed to rule uncontrolled. The very Minister who had taken office under\r\nSchwarzenberg as the representative of the modern spirit, to which the\r\nGovernment still professed to render homage, became the instrument of an\r\nact of submission to the Papacy which marked the lowest point to which\r\nAustrian policy fell. Alexander Bach, a prominent Liberal in Vienna at the\r\nbeginning of 1848, had accepted office at the price of his independence,\r\nand surrendered himself to the aristocratic and clerical influences that\r\ndominated the Court. Consistent only in his efforts to simplify the forms\r\nof government, to promote the ascendency of German over all other elements\r\nin the State, to maintain the improvement in the peasant's condition\r\neffected by the Parliament of Kremsier, Bach, as Minister of the Interior,\r\nmade war in all other respects on his own earlier principles. In the former\r\nrepresentative of the Liberalism of the professional classes in Vienna\r\nabsolutism had now its most efficient instrument; and the Concordat\r\nnegotiated by Bach with the Papacy in 1855 marked the definite submission\r\nof Austria to the ecclesiastical pretensions which in these years of\r\npolitical languor and discouragement gained increasing recognition\r\nthroughout Central Europe. Ultramontanism had sought allies in many\r\npolitical camps since the revolution of 1848. It had dallied in some\r\ncountries with Republicanism; but its truer instincts divined in the\r\nvictory of absolutist systems its own surest gain. Accommodations between\r\nthe Papacy and several of the German Governments were made in the years\r\nsucceeding 1849; and from the centralised despotism of the Emperor Francis\r\nJoseph the Church won concessions which since the time of Maria Theresa it\r\nhad in vain sought from any ruler of the Austrian State.\r\n\r\n[France after 1848.]\r\n\r\n[Louis Napoleon.]\r\n\r\nThe European drama which began in 1848 had more of unity and more of\r\nconcentration in its opening than in its close. In Italy it ends with the\r\nfall of Venice; in Germany the interest lingers till the days of Olmütz; in\r\nFrance there is no decisive break in the action until the Coup d'Etat\r\nwhich, at the end of the year 1851, made Louis Napoleon in all but name\r\nEmperor of France. The six million votes which had raised Louis Napoleon to\r\nthe Presidency of the Republic might well have filled with alarm all who\r\nhoped for a future of constitutional rule; yet the warning conveyed by the\r\nelection seems to have been understood by but few. As the representative of\r\norder and authority, as the declared enemy of Socialism, Louis Napoleon was\r\non the same side as the Parliamentary majority; he had even been supported\r\nin his candidature by Parliamentary leaders such as M. Thiers. His victory\r\nwas welcomed as a victory over Socialism and the Red Republic; he had\r\nreceived some patronage from the official party of order, and it was\r\nexpected that, as nominal chief of the State, he would act as the\r\ninstrument of this party. He was an adventurer, but an adventurer with so\r\nlittle that was imposing about him, that it scarcely occurred to men of\r\ninfluence in Paris to credit him with the capacity for mischief. His mean\r\nlook and spiritless address, the absurdities of his past, the\r\ninsignificance of his political friends, caused him to be regarded during\r\nhis first months of public life with derision rather than with fear. The\r\nFrench, said M. Thiers long afterwards, made two mistakes about Louis\r\nNapoleon: the first when they took him for a fool, the second when they\r\ntook him for a man of genius. It was not until the appearance of the letter\r\nto Colonel Ney, in which the President ostentatiously separated himself\r\nfrom his Ministers and emphasised his personal will in the direction of the\r\nforeign policy of France, that suspicions of danger to the Republic from\r\nhis ambition arose. From this time, in the narrow circle of the Ministers\r\nwhom official duty brought into direct contact with the President, a\r\nconstant sense of insecurity and dread of some new surprise on his part\r\nprevailed, though the accord which had been broken by the letter to Colonel\r\nNey was for a while outwardly re-established, and the forms of\r\nParliamentary government remained unimpaired.\r\n\r\n[Message of Oct. 31, 1849.]\r\n\r\nThe first year of Louis Napoleon's term of office was drawing to a close\r\nwhen a message from him was delivered to the Assembly which seemed to\r\nannounce an immediate attack upon the Constitution. The Ministry in office\r\nwas composed of men of high Parliamentary position; it enjoyed the entire\r\nconfidence of a great majority in the Assembly, and had enforced with at\r\nleast sufficient energy the measures of public security which the President\r\nand the country seemed agreed in demanding. Suddenly, on the 31st of\r\nOctober, the President announced to the Assembly by a message carried by\r\none of his aides-de-camp that the Ministry were dismissed. The reason\r\nassigned for their dismissal was the want of unity within the Cabinet\r\nitself; but the language used by the President announced much more than a\r\nministerial change. \"France, in the midst of confusion, seeks for the hand,\r\nthe will of him whom it elected on the 10th of December. The victory won on\r\nthat day was the victory of a system, for the name of Napoleon is in itself\r\na programme. It signifies order, authority, religion, national prosperity\r\nwithin; national dignity without. It is this policy, inaugurated by my\r\nelection, that I desire to carry to triumph with the support of the\r\nAssembly and of the people.\" In order to save the Republic from anarchy, to\r\nmaintain the prestige of France among other nations, the President declared\r\nthat he needed men of action rather than of words; yet when the list of the\r\nnew Ministers appeared, it contained scarcely a single name of weight.\r\nLouis Napoleon had called to office persons whose very obscurity had marked\r\nthem as his own instruments, and guaranteed to him the ascendency which he\r\nhad not hitherto possessed within the Cabinet. Satisfied with having given\r\nthis proof of his power, he resumed the appearance of respect, if not of\r\ncordiality, towards the Assembly. He had learnt to beware of precipitate\r\naction; above two years of office were still before him; and he had now\r\ndone enough to make it clear to all who were disposed to seek their\r\nfortunes in a new political cause that their services on his behalf would\r\nbe welcomed, and any excess of zeal more than pardoned. From this time\r\nthere grew up a party which had for its watchword the exaltation of Louis\r\nNapoleon and the derision of the methods of Parliamentary government.\r\nJournalists, unsuccessful politicians, adventurers of every description,\r\nwere enlisted in the ranks of this obscure but active band. For their acts\r\nand their utterances no one was responsible but themselves. They were\r\ndisavowed without compunction when their hardihood went too far; but their\r\nventures brought them no peril, and the generosity of the President was not\r\nwanting to those who insisted on serving him in spite of himself.\r\n\r\n[Law limiting the Franchise, May 31, 1850.]\r\n\r\nFrance was still trembling with the shock of the Four Days of June; and\r\nmeasures of repression formed the common ground upon which Louis Napoleon\r\nand the Assembly met without fear of conflict. Certain elections which were\r\nheld in the spring of 1850, and which gave a striking victory in Paris and\r\nelsewhere to Socialist or Ultra-Democratic candidates, revived the alarms\r\nof the owners of property, and inspired the fear that with universal\r\nsuffrage the Legislature itself might ultimately fall into the hands of the\r\nRed Republicans. The principle of universal suffrage had been proclaimed\r\nalmost by accident in the midst of the revolution of 1848. It had been\r\nembodied in the Constitution of that year because it was found already in\r\nexistence. No party had seriously considered the conditions under which it\r\nwas to be exercised, or had weighed the political qualifications of the\r\nmass to whom it was so lightly thrown. When election after election\r\nreturned to the Chamber men whose principles were held to menace society\r\nitself, the cry arose that France must be saved from the hands of the vile\r\nmultitude; and the President called upon a Committee of the Assembly to\r\nframe the necessary measures of electoral reform. Within a week the work of\r\nthe Committee was completed, and the law which it had drafted was brought\r\nbefore the Assembly. It was proposed that, instead of a residence of six\r\nmonths, a continuous residence of three years in the same commune should be\r\nrequired of every voter, and that the fulfilment of this condition should\r\nbe proved, not by ordinary evidence, but by one of certain specified acts,\r\nsuch as the payment of personal taxes. With modifications of little\r\nimportance the Bill was passed by the Assembly. Whether its real effect was\r\nforeseen even by those who desired the greatest possible limitation of the\r\nfranchise is doubtful; it is certain that many who supported it believed,\r\nin their ignorance of the practical working of electoral laws, that they\r\nwere excluding from the franchise only the vagabond and worthless class\r\nwhich has no real place within the body politic. When the electoral lists\r\ndrawn up in pursuance of the measure appeared, they astounded all parties\r\nalike. Three out of the ten millions of voters in France were\r\ndisfranchised. Not only the inhabitants of whole quarters in the great\r\ncities but the poorer classes among the peasantry throughout France had\r\ndisappeared from the electoral body. The Assembly had at one blow converted\r\ninto enemies the entire mass of the population that lived by the wages of\r\nbodily labour. It had committed an act of political suicide, and had given\r\nto a man so little troubled with scruples of honour as Louis Napoleon the\r\nfatal opportunity of appealing to France as the champion of national\r\nsovereignty and the vindicator of universal suffrage against an Assembly\r\nwhich had mutilated it in the interests of class. [454]\r\n\r\n[Prospects of Louis Napoleon.]\r\n\r\nThe duration of the Presidency was fixed by the Constitution of 1848 at\r\nfour years, and it was enacted that the President should not be re-eligible\r\nto his dignity. By the operation of certain laws imperfectly adjusted to\r\none another, the tenure of office by Louis Napoleon expired on the 8th of\r\nMay, 1852, while the date for the dissolution of the Assembly fell within a\r\nfew weeks of this day. France was therefore threatened with the dangers\r\nattending the almost simultaneous extinction of all authority. The perils\r\nof 1852 loomed only too visibly before the country, and Louis Napoleon\r\naddressed willing hearers when, in the summer of 1850, he began to hint at\r\nthe necessity of a prolongation of his own power. The Parliamentary recess\r\nwas employed by the President in two journeys through the Departments; the\r\nfirst through those of the south-east, where Socialism was most active, and\r\nwhere his appearance served at once to prove his own confidence and to\r\ninvigorate the friends of authority; the second through Normandy, where the\r\nprevailing feeling was strongly in favour of firm government, and\r\nutterances could safely be made by the President which would have brought\r\nhim into some risk at Paris. In suggesting that France required his own\r\ncontinued presence at the head of the State Louis Napoleon was not\r\nnecessarily suggesting a violation of the law. It was provided by the\r\nStatutes of 1848 that the Assembly by a vote of three-fourths might order a\r\nrevision of the Constitution; and in favour of this revision petitions were\r\nalready being drawn up throughout the country. Were the clause forbidding\r\nthe re-election of the President removed from the Constitution, Louis\r\nNapoleon might fairly believe that an immense majority of the French people\r\nwould re-invest him with power. He would probably have been content with a\r\nlegal re-election had this been rendered possible; but the Assembly showed\r\nlittle sign of a desire to smooth his way, and it therefore became\r\nnecessary for him to seek the means of realising his aims in violation of\r\nthe law. He had persuaded himself that his mission, his destiny, was to\r\nrule France; in other words, he had made up his mind to run such risks and\r\nto sanction such crimes as might be necessary to win him sovereign power.\r\nWith the loftier impulses of ambition, motives of a meaner kind stimulated\r\nhim to acts of energy. Never wealthy, the father of a family though\r\nunmarried, he had exhausted his means, and would have returned to private\r\nlife a destitute man, if not laden with debt. When his own resolution\r\nflagged, there were those about him too deeply interested in his fortunes\r\nto allow him to draw back.\r\n\r\n[Louis Napoleon and the army.]\r\n\r\n[Dismissal of Changarnier, Jan., 1851.]\r\n\r\nIt was by means of the army that Louis Napoleon intended in the last resort\r\nto make himself master of France, and the army had therefore to be won over\r\nto his personal cause. The generals who had gained distinction either in\r\nthe Algerian wars or in the suppression of insurrection in France were\r\nwithout exception Orleanists or Republicans. Not a single officer of\r\neminence was as yet included in the Bonapartist band. The President himself\r\nhad never seen service except in a Swiss camp of exercise; beyond his name\r\nhe possessed nothing that could possibly touch the imagination of a\r\nsoldier. The heroic element not being discoverable in his person or his\r\ncareer, it remained to work by more material methods. Louis Napoleon had\r\nlearnt many things in England, and had perhaps observed in the English\r\nelections of that period how much may be effected by the simple means of\r\nmoney-bribes and strong drink. The saviour of society was not ashamed to\r\norder the garrison of Paris double rations of brandy and to distribute\r\ninnumerable doles of half a franc or less. Military banquets were given, in\r\nwhich the sergeant and the corporal sat side by side with the higher\r\nofficers. Promotion was skilfully offered or withheld. As the generals of\r\nthe highest position were hostile to Bonaparte, it was the easier to tempt\r\ntheir subordinates with the prospect of their places. In the acclamations\r\nwhich greeted the President at the reviews held at Paris in the autumn of\r\n1850, in the behaviour both of officers and men in certain regiments, it\r\nwas seen how successful had been the emissaries of Bonapartism. The\r\nCommittee which represented the absent Chamber in vain called the Minister\r\nof War to account for these irregularities. It was in vain that\r\nChangarnier, who, as commander both of the National Guard of Paris and of\r\nthe first military division, seemed to hold the arbitrament between\r\nPresident and Assembly in his hands, openly declared at the beginning of\r\n1851 in favour of the Constitution. He was dismissed from his post; and\r\nalthough a vote of censure which followed this dismissal led to the\r\nresignation of the Ministry, the Assembly was unable to reinstate\r\nChangarnier in his command, and helplessly witnessed the authority which he\r\nhad held pass into hostile or untrustworthy hands.\r\n\r\n[Proposed Revision of the Constitution.]\r\n\r\n[Revision of the Constitution rejected, July 19.]\r\n\r\nThere now remained only one possible means of averting the attack upon the\r\nConstitution which was so clearly threatened, and that was by subjecting\r\nthe Constitution itself to revision in order that Louis Napoleon might\r\nlegally seek re-election at the end of his Presidency. An overwhelming\r\ncurrent of public opinion pressed indeed in the direction of such a change.\r\nHowever gross and undisguised the initiative of the local functionaries in\r\npreparing the petitions which showered upon the Assembly, the national\r\ncharacter of the demand could not be doubted. There was no other candidate\r\nwhose name carried with it any genuine popularity or prestige, or around\r\nwhom even the Parliamentary sections at enmity with the President could\r\nrally. The Assembly was divided not very unevenly between Legitimists,\r\nOrleanists, and Republicans. Had indeed the two monarchical groups been\r\nable to act in accord, they might have had some hope of re-establishing the\r\nthrone; and an attempt had already been made to effect a union, on the\r\nunderstanding that the childless Comté de Chambord should recognise the\r\ngrandson of Louis Philippe as his heir, the House of Orleans renouncing its\r\nclaims during the lifetime of the chief of the elder line. These plans had\r\nbeen frustrated by the refusal of the Comté de Chambord to sanction any\r\nappeal to the popular vote, and the restoration of the monarchy was\r\ntherefore hopeless for the present. It remained for the Assembly to decide\r\nwhether it would facilitate Louis Napoleon's re-election as President by a\r\nrevision of the Constitution or brave the risk of his violent usurpation of\r\npower. The position was a sad and even humiliating one for those who, while\r\nthey could not disguise their real feeling towards the Prince, yet knew\r\nthemselves unable to count on the support of the nation if they should\r\nresist him. The Legitimists, more sanguine in temper, kept in view an\r\nultimate restoration of the monarchy, and lent themselves gladly to any\r\npolicy which might weaken the constitutional safeguards of the Republic.\r\nThe Republican minority alone determined to resist any proposal for\r\nrevision, and to stake everything upon the maintenance of the constitution\r\nin its existing form. Weak as the Republicans were as compared with the\r\nother groups in the Assembly when united against them, they were yet strong\r\nenough to prevent the Ministry from securing that majority of three-fourths\r\nwithout which the revision of the Constitution could not be undertaken.\r\nFour hundred and fifty votes were given in favour of revision, two hundred\r\nand seventy against it (July 19th). The proposal therefore fell to the\r\nground, and Louis Napoleon, who could already charge the Assembly with\r\nhaving by its majority destroyed universal suffrage, could now charge it\r\nwith having by its minority forbidden the nation to choose its own head.\r\nNothing more was needed by him. He had only to decide upon the time and the\r\ncircumstances of the _coup d'état_ which was to rid him of his adversaries\r\nand to make him master of France.\r\n\r\n[Preparations for the _coup d'état_.]\r\n\r\nLouis Napoleon had few intimate confidants; the chief among these were his\r\nhalf-brother Morny, one of the illegitimate offspring of Queen Hortense, a\r\nman of fashion and speculator in the stocks; Fialin or Persigny, a person\r\nof humble origin who had proved himself a devoted follower of the Prince\r\nthrough good and evil; and Fleury, an officer at this time on a mission in\r\nAlgiers. These were not men out of whom Louis Napoleon could form an\r\nadministration, but they were useful to him in discovering and winning over\r\nsoldiers and officials of sufficient standing to give to the execution of\r\nthe conspiracy something of the appearance of an act of Government. A\r\ngeneral was needed at the War Office who would go all lengths in\r\nillegality. Such a man had already been found in St. Arnaud, commander of a\r\nbrigade in Algiers, a brilliant soldier who had redeemed a disreputable\r\npast by years of hard service, and who was known to be ready to treat his\r\nFrench fellow-citizens exactly as he would treat the Arabs. As St. Arnaud's\r\nname was not yet familiar in Paris, a campaign was arranged in the summer\r\nof 1851 for the purpose of winning him distinction. At the cost of some\r\nhundreds of lives St. Arnaud was pushed into sufficient fame; and after\r\nreceiving congratulations proportioned to his exploits from the President's\r\nown hand, he was summoned to Paris, in order at the right moment to be made\r\nMinister of War. A troop of younger officers, many of whom gained a\r\nlamentable celebrity as the generals of 1870, were gradually brought over\r\nfrom Algiers and placed round the Minister in the capital. The command of\r\nthe army of Paris was given to General Magnan, who, though he preferred not\r\nto share in the deliberations on the _coup d'état_, had promised his\r\nco-operation when the moment should arrive. The support, or at least the\r\nacquiescence, of the army seemed thus to be assured. The National Guard,\r\nwhich, under Changarnier, would probably have rallied in defence of the\r\nAssembly, had been placed under an officer pledged to keep it in inaction.\r\nFor the management of the police Louis Napoleon had fixed upon M. Maupas,\r\nPréfet of the Haute Garonne. This person, to whose shamelessness we owe the\r\nmost authentic information that exists on the _coup d'état_, had,\r\nwhile in an inferior station, made it his business to ingratiate himself\r\nwith the President by sending to him personally police reports which ought\r\nto have been sent to the Ministers. The objects and the character of M.\r\nMaupas were soon enough understood by Louis Napoleon. He promoted him to\r\nhigh office; sheltered him from the censure of his superiors; and, when the\r\n_coup d'état_ was drawing nigh, called him to Paris, in the full and\r\nwell-grounded confidence that, whatever the most perfidious ingenuity could\r\ncontrive in turning the guardians of the law against the law itself, that\r\nM. Maupas, as Préfet of Police, might be relied upon to accomplish.\r\n\r\n[The _coup d'état_ fixed for December.]\r\n\r\nPreparations for the _coup d'état_ had been so far advanced in\r\nSeptember that a majority of the conspirators had then urged Louis Napoleon\r\nto strike the blow without delay, while the members of the Assembly were\r\nstill dispersed over France in the vacation. St. Arnaud, however, refused\r\nhis assent, declaring that the deputies, if left free, would assemble at a\r\ndistance from Paris, summon to them the generals loyal to the Constitution,\r\nand commence a civil war. He urged that, in order to avoid greater\r\nsubsequent risks, it would be necessary to seize all the leading\r\nrepresentatives and generals from whom resistance might be expected, and to\r\nhold them under durance until the crisis should be over. This simultaneous\r\narrest of all the foremost public men in France could only be effected at a\r\ntime when the Assembly was sitting. St. Arnaud therefore demanded that the\r\n_coup d'état_ should be postponed till the winter. Another reason made\r\nfor delay. Little as the populace of Paris loved the reactionary Assembly,\r\nLouis Napoleon was not altogether assured that it would quietly witness his\r\nown usurpation of power. In waiting until the Chamber should again be in\r\nsession, he saw the opportunity of exhibiting his cause as that of the\r\nmasses themselves, and of justifying his action as the sole means of\r\nenforcing popular rights against a legislature obstinately bent on denying\r\nthem. Louis Napoleon's own Ministers had overthrown universal suffrage.\r\nThis might indeed be matter for comment on the part of the censorious, but\r\nit was not a circumstance to stand in the way of the execution of a great\r\ndesign. Accordingly Louis Napoleon determined to demand from the Assembly\r\nat the opening of the winter session the repeal of the electoral law of May\r\n31st, and to make its refusal, on which he could confidently reckon, the\r\noccasion of its destruction.\r\n\r\n[Louis Napoleon demands repeal of Law of May 31.]\r\n\r\n[The Assembly refuses.]\r\n\r\nThe conspirators were up to this time conspirators and nothing more. A\r\nMinistry still subsisted which was not initiated in the President's designs\r\nnor altogether at his command. On his requiring that the repeal of the law\r\nof May 31st should be proposed to the Assembly, the Cabinet resigned. The\r\nway to the highest functions of State was thus finally opened for the\r\nagents of the _coup d'état_. St. Arnaud was placed at the War Office,\r\nMaupas at the Prefecture of Police. The colleagues assigned to them were\r\ntoo insignificant to exercise any control over their actions. At the\r\nreopening of the Assembly on the 4th of November an energetic message from\r\nthe President was read. On the one hand he denounced a vast and perilous\r\ncombination of all the most dangerous elements of society which threatened\r\nto overwhelm France in the following year; on the other hand he demanded,\r\nwith certain undefined safeguards, the re-establishment of universal\r\nsuffrage. The middle classes were scared with the prospect of a Socialist\r\nrevolution; the Assembly was divided against itself, and the democracy of\r\nParis flattered by the homage paid to the popular vote. With very little\r\ndelay a measure repealing the Law of May 31st was introduced into the\r\nAssembly. It was supported by the Republicans and by many members of the\r\nother groups; but the majority of the Assembly, while anxious to devise\r\nsome compromise, refused to condemn its own work in the unqualified form on\r\nwhich the President insisted. The Bill was thrown out by seven votes.\r\nForthwith the rumour of an impending _coup d'etat_ spread through\r\nParis. The Questors, or members charged with the safeguarding of the\r\nAssembly, moved the resolutions necessary to enable them to secure\r\nsufficient military aid. Even now prompt action might perhaps have saved\r\nthe Chamber. But the Republican deputies, incensed by their defeat on the\r\nquestion of universal suffrage, plunged headlong into the snare set for\r\nthem by the President, and combined with his open or secret partisans to\r\nreject the proposition of the Questors. Changarnier had blindly vouched for\r\nthe fidelity of the army; one Republican deputy, more imaginative than his\r\ncolleagues, bade the Assembly confide in their invisible sentinel, the\r\npeople. Thus the majority of the Chamber, with the clearest warning of\r\ndanger, insisted on giving the aggressor every possible advantage. If the\r\nimbecility of opponents is the best augury of success in a bold enterprise,\r\nthe President had indeed little reason to anticipate failure.\r\n\r\n[The _coup d'etat_, Dec. 2.]\r\n\r\nThe execution of the _coup d'etat_ was fixed for the early morning of\r\nDecember 2nd. On the previous evening Louis Napoleon held a public\r\nreception at the Elysée, his quiet self-possessed manner indicating nothing\r\nof the struggle at hand. Before the guests dispersed the President withdrew\r\nto his study. There the last council of the conspirators was held, and they\r\nparted, each to the execution of the work assigned to him. The central\r\nelement in the plan was the arrest of Cavaignac, of Changarnier and three\r\nother generals who were members of the Assembly, of eleven civilian\r\ndeputies including M. Thiers, and of sixty-two other politicians of\r\ninfluence. Maupas summoned to the Prefecture of Police in the dead of night\r\na sufficient number of his trusted agents, received each of them on his\r\narrival in a separate room, and charged each with the arrest of one of the\r\nvictims. The arrests were accomplished before dawn, and the leading\r\nsoldiers and citizens of France met one another in the prison of Mazas. The\r\nPalais Bourbon, the meeting-place of the Assembly, was occupied by troops.\r\nThe national printing establishment was seized by gendarmes, and the\r\nproclamations of Louis Napoleon, distributed sentence by sentence to\r\ndifferent compositors, were set in type before the workmen knew upon what\r\nthey were engaged. When day broke the Parisians found the soldiers in the\r\nstreets, and the walls placarded with manifestoes of Louis Napoleon. The\r\nfirst of these was a decree which announced in the name of the French\r\npeople that the National Assembly and the Council of State were dissolved,\r\nthat universal suffrage was restored, and that the nation was convoked in\r\nits electoral colleges from the 14th to the 21st of December. The second\r\nwas a proclamation to the people, in which Louis Napoleon denounced at once\r\nthe monarchical conspirators within the Assembly and the anarchists who\r\nsought to overthrow all government. His duty called upon him to save the\r\nRepublic by an appeal to the nation. He proposed the establishment of a\r\ndecennial executive authority, with a Senate, a Council of State, a\r\nLegislative Body, and other institutions borrowed from the Consulate of\r\n1799. If the nation refused him a majority of its votes he would summon a\r\nnew Assembly and resign his powers; if the nation believed in the cause of\r\nwhich his name was the symbol, in France regenerated by the Revolution and\r\norganised by the Emperor, it would prove this by ratifying his authority. A\r\nthird proclamation was addressed to the army. In 1830 and in 1848 the army\r\nhad been treated as the conquered, but its voice was now to be heard.\r\nCommon glories and sorrows united the soldiers of France with Napoleon's\r\nheir, and the future would unite them in common devotion to the repose and\r\ngreatness of their country.\r\n\r\n[Paris on Dec. 2.]\r\n\r\nThe full meaning of these manifestoes was not at first understood by the\r\ngroups who read them. The Assembly was so unpopular that the announcement\r\nof its dissolution, with the restoration of universal suffrage, pleased\r\nrather than alarmed the democratic quarters of Paris. It was not until some\r\nhours had passed that the arrests became generally known, and that the\r\nfirst symptoms of resistance appeared. Groups of deputies assembled at the\r\nhouses of the Parliamentary leaders; a body of fifty even succeeded in\r\nentering the Palais Bourbon and in commencing a debate: they were, however,\r\nsoon dispersed by soldiers. Later in the day above two hundred members\r\nassembled at the Mairie of the Tenth Arrondissement. There they passed\r\nresolutions declaring the President removed from his office, and appointing\r\na commander of the troops at Paris. The first officers who were sent to\r\nclear the Mairie flinched in the execution of their work, and withdrew for\r\nfurther orders. The Magistrates of the High Court, whose duty it was to\r\norder the impeachment of the President in case of the violation of his oath\r\nto the Constitution, assembled, and commenced the necessary proceedings;\r\nbut before they could sign a warrant, soldiers forced their way into the\r\nhall and drove the judges from the Bench. In due course General Forey\r\nappeared with a strong body of troops at the Mairie, where the two hundred\r\ndeputies were assembled. Refusing to disperse, they were one and all\r\narrested, and conducted as prisoners between files of troops to the\r\nBarracks of the Quai d'Orsay. The National Guard, whose drums had been\r\nremoved by their commander in view of any spontaneous movement to arms,\r\nremained invisible. Louis Napoleon rode out amidst the acclamations of the\r\nsoldiery; and when the day closed it seemed as if Paris had resolved to\r\naccept the change of Government and the overthrow of the Constitution\r\nwithout a struggle.\r\n\r\n[December 3.]\r\n\r\n[December 4.]\r\n\r\nThere were, however, a few resolute men at work in the workmen's quarters;\r\nand in the wealthier part of the city the outrage upon the National\r\nRepresentation gradually roused a spirit of resistance. On the morning of\r\nDecember 3rd the Deputy Baudin met with his death in attempting to defend a\r\nbarricade which had been erected in the Faubourg St. Antoine. The artisans\r\nof eastern Paris showed, however, little inclination to take up arms on\r\nbehalf of those who had crushed them in the Four Days of June; the\r\nagitation was strongest within the Boulevards, and spread westwards towards\r\nthe stateliest district of Paris. The barricades erected on the south of\r\nthe Boulevards were so numerous, the crowds so formidable, that towards the\r\nclose of the day the troops were withdrawn, and it was determined that\r\nafter a night of quiet they should make a general attack and end the\r\nstruggle at one blow. At midday on December 4th divisions of the army\r\nconverged from all directions upon the insurgent quarter. The barricades\r\nwere captured or levelled by artillery, and with a loss on the part of the\r\ntroops of twenty-eight killed, and a hundred and eighty wounded resistance\r\nwas overcome. But the soldiers had been taught to regard the inhabitants of\r\nParis as their enemies, and they bettered the instructions given them.\r\nMaddened by drink or panic, they commenced indiscriminate firing in the\r\nBoulevards after the conflict was over, and slaughtered all who either in\r\nthe street or at the windows of the houses came within range of their\r\nbullets. According to official admissions, the lives of sixteen civilians\r\npaid for every soldier slain; independent estimates place far higher the\r\nnumber of the victims of this massacre. Two thousand arrests followed, and\r\nevery Frenchman who appeared dangerous to Louis Napoleon's myrmidons, from\r\nThiers and Victor Hugo down to the anarchist orators of the wineshops, was\r\neither transported, exiled, or lodged in prison. Thus was the Republic\r\npreserved and society saved.\r\n\r\n[The Plébiscite, Dec. 20.]\r\n\r\n[Napoleon III. Emperor, Dec. 2, 1852.]\r\n\r\nFrance in general received the news of the _coup d'etat_ with indifference:\r\nwhere it excited popular movements these movements were of such a character\r\nthat Louis Napoleon drew from them the utmost profit. A certain fierce,\r\nblind Socialism had spread among the poorest of the rural classes in the\r\ncentre and south of France. In these departments there were isolated\r\nrisings, accompanied by acts of such murderous outrage and folly that a\r\ngeneral terror seized the surrounding districts. In the course of a few\r\ndays the predatory bands were dispersed, and an unsparing chastisement\r\ninflicted on all who were concerned in their misdeeds; but the reports sent\r\nto Paris were too serviceable to Louis Napoleon to be left in obscurity;\r\nand these brutish village-outbreaks, which collapsed at the first\r\nappearance of a handful of soldiers, were represented as the prelude to a\r\nvast Socialist revolution from which the _coup d'etat_, and that alone, had\r\nsaved France. Terrified by the re-appearance of the Red Spectre, the French\r\nnation proceeded on the 20th of December to pass its judgment on the\r\naccomplished usurpation. The question submitted for the _plébiscite_ was,\r\nwhether the people desired the maintenance of Louis Napoleon's authority\r\nand committed to him the necessary powers for establishing a Constitution\r\non the basis laid down in his proclamation of December 2nd. Seven million\r\nvotes answered this question in the affirmative, less than one-tenth of\r\nthat number in the negative. The result was made known on the last day of\r\nthe year 1851. On the first day of the new year Louis Napoleon attended a\r\nservice of thanksgiving at Notre Dame, took possession of the Tuileries,\r\nand restored the eagle as the military emblem of France. He was now in all\r\nbut name an absolute sovereign. The Church, the army, the ever-servile body\r\nof the civil administration, waited impatiently for the revival of the\r\nImperial title. Nor was the saviour of society the man to shrink from\r\nfurther responsibilities. Before the year closed the people was once more\r\ncalled upon to express its will. Seven millions of votes pronounced for\r\nhereditary power; and on the anniversary of the _coup d'etat_ Napoleon III.\r\nwas proclaimed Emperor of the French.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nEngland and France in 1851--Russia under Nicholas--The Hungarian\r\nRefugees--Dispute between France and Russia on the Holy Places--Nicholas\r\nand the British Ambassador--Lord Stratford de Redcliffe--Menschikoff's\r\nMission--Russian Troops enter the Danubian Principalities--Lord Aberdeen's\r\nCabinet--Movements of the Fleets--The Vienna Note--The Fleets pass the\r\nDardanelles--Turkish Squadron destroyed at Sinope--Declaration of\r\nWar--Policy of Austria--Policy of Prussia--The Western Powers and the\r\nEuropean Concert--Siege of Silistria--The Principalities evacuated--Further\r\nobjects of the Western Powers--Invasion of the Crimea--Battle of the\r\nAlma--The Flank March--Balaclava--Inkermann--Winter in the Crimea--Death of\r\nNicholas--Conference of Vienna--Austria--Progress of the Siege--Plans of\r\nNapoleon III.--Canrobert and Pélissier--Unsuccessful Assault--Battle of the\r\nTchernaya--Capture of the Malakoff--Fall of Sebastopol--Fall of\r\nKars--Negotiations for Peace--The Conference of Paris--Treaty of Paris\r\n--The Danubian Principalities--Continued discord in the Ottoman\r\nEmpire--Revision of the Treaty of Paris in 1871.\r\n\r\n\r\n[England in 1851.]\r\n\r\nThe year 1851 was memorable in England as that of the Great Exhibition.\r\nThirty-six years of peace, marked by an enormous development of\r\nmanufacturing industry, by the introduction of railroads, and by the\r\nvictory of the principle of Free Trade, had culminated in a spectacle so\r\nimpressive and so novel that to many it seemed the emblem and harbinger of\r\na new epoch in the history of mankind, in which war should cease, and the\r\nrivalry of nations should at length find its true scope in the advancement\r\nof the arts of peace. The apostles of Free Trade had idealised the cause\r\nfor which they contended. The unhappiness and the crimes of nations had, as\r\nthey held, been due principally to the action of governments, which plunged\r\nharmless millions into war for dynastic ends, and paralysed human energy by\r\ntheir own blind and senseless interference with the natural course of\r\nexchange. Compassion for the poor and the suffering, a just resentment\r\nagainst laws which in the supposed interest of a minority condemned the\r\nmass of the nation to a life of want, gave moral fervour and elevation to\r\nthe teaching of Cobden and those who shared his spirit. Like others who\r\nhave been constrained by a noble enthusiasm, they had their visions; and in\r\ntheir sense of the greatness of that new force which was ready to operate\r\nupon human life, they both forgot the incompleteness of their own doctrine,\r\nand under-estimated the influences which worked, and long must work, upon\r\nmankind in an opposite direction. In perfect sincerity the leader of\r\nEnglish economical reform at the middle of this century looked forward to a\r\nreign of peace as the result of unfettered intercourse between the members\r\nof the European family. What the man of genius and conviction had\r\nproclaimed the charlatan repeated in his turn. Louis Napoleon appreciated\r\nthe charm which schemes of commercial development exercised upon the\r\ntrading classes in France. He was ready to salute the Imperial eagles as\r\nobjects of worship and to invoke the memories of Napoleon's glory when\r\naddressing soldiers; when it concerned him to satisfy the commercial world,\r\nhe was the very embodiment of peace and of peaceful industry. \"Certain\r\npersons,\" he said, in an address at Bordeaux, shortly before assuming the\r\ntitle of Emperor, \"say that the Empire is war. I say that the Empire is\r\npeace; for France desires peace, and when France is satisfied the world is\r\ntranquil. We have waste territories to cultivate, roads to open, harbours\r\nto dig, a system of railroads to complete; we have to bring all our great\r\nwestern ports into connection with the American continent by a rapidity of\r\ncommunication which we still want. We have ruins to restore, false gods to\r\noverthrow, truths to make triumphant. This is the sense that I attach to\r\nthe Empire; these are the conquests which I contemplate.\" Never had the\r\nideal of industrious peace been more impressively set before mankind than\r\nin the years which succeeded the convulsion of 1848. Yet the epoch on which\r\nEurope was then about to enter proved to be pre-eminently an epoch of war.\r\nIn the next quarter of a century there was not one of the Great Powers\r\nwhich was not engaged in an armed struggle with its rivals. Nor were the\r\nwars of this period in any sense the result of accident, or disconnected\r\nwith the stream of political tendencies which makes the history of the age.\r\nWith one exception they left in their train great changes for which the\r\ntime was ripe, changes which for more than a generation had been the\r\nrecognised objects of national desire, but which persuasion and revolution\r\nhad equally failed to bring into effect. The Crimean War alone was barren\r\nin positive results of a lasting nature, and may seem only to have\r\npostponed, at enormous cost of life, the fall of a doomed and outworn\r\nPower. But the time has not yet arrived when the real bearing of the\r\noverthrow of Russia in 1854 on the destiny of the Christian races of Turkey\r\ncan be confidently expressed. The victory of the Sultan's protectors\r\ndelayed the emancipation of these races for twenty years; the victory, or\r\nthe unchecked aggression, of Russia in 1854 might possibly have closed to\r\nthem for ever the ways to national independence.\r\n\r\n[Russian policy under Nicholas.]\r\n\r\nThe plans formed by the Empress Catherine in the last century for the\r\nrestoration of the Greek Empire under a prince of the Russian House had\r\nlong been abandoned at St. Petersburg. The later aim of Russian policy\r\nfound its clearest expression in the Treaty of Unkiar Skelessi, extorted\r\nfrom Sultan Mahmud in 1833 in the course of the first war against Mehemet\r\nAli. This Treaty, if it had not been set aside by the Western Powers, would\r\nhave made the Ottoman Empire a vassal State under the Czar's protection. In\r\nthe concert of Europe which was called into being by the second war of\r\nMehemet Ali against the Sultan in 1840, Nicholas had considered it his\r\ninterest to act with England and the German Powers in defence of the Porte\r\nagainst its Egyptian rival and his French ally. A policy of moderation had\r\nbeen imposed upon Russia by the increased watchfulness and activity now\r\ndisplayed by the other European States in all that related to the Ottoman\r\nEmpire. Isolated aggression had become impracticable; it was necessary for\r\nRussia to seek the countenance or support of some ally before venturing on\r\nthe next step in the extension of its power southwards.\r\n\r\n[Nicholas in England, 1844.]\r\n\r\nIn 1844 Nicholas visited England. The object of his journey was to sound\r\nthe Court and Government, and to lay the foundation for concerted action\r\nbetween Russia and England, to the exclusion of France, when circumstances\r\nshould bring about the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, an event which\r\nthe Czar believed to be not far off. Peel was then Prime Minister; Lord\r\nAberdeen was Foreign Secretary. Aberdeen had begun his political career in\r\na diplomatic mission to the Allied Armies in 1814. His feelings towards\r\nRussia were those of a loyal friend towards an old ally; and the\r\nremembrance of the epoch of 1814, when the young Nicholas had made\r\nacquaintance with Lord Aberdeen in France, appears to have given to the\r\nCzar a peculiar sense of confidence in the goodwill of the English Minister\r\ntowards himself. Nicholas spoke freely with Aberdeen, as well as with Peel\r\nand Wellington, on the impending fall of the Ottoman Empire. \"We have,\" he\r\nsaid, \"a sick, a dying man on our hands. We must keep him alive so long as\r\nit is possible to do so, but we must frankly take into view all\r\ncontingencies. I wish for no inch of Turkish soil myself, but neither will\r\nI permit any other Power to seize an inch of it. France, which has designs\r\nupon Africa, upon the Mediterranean, and upon the East, is the only Power\r\nto be feared. An understanding between England and Russia will preserve the\r\npeace of Europe.\" If the Czar pursued his speculations further into detail,\r\nof which there is no evidence, he elicited no response. He was heard with\r\ncaution, and his visit appears to have produced nothing more than the\r\nformal expression of a desire on the part of the British Government that\r\nthe existing treaty-rights of Russia should be respected by the Porte,\r\ntogether with an unmeaning promise that, if unexpected events should occur\r\nin Turkey, Russia and England should enter into counsel as to the best\r\ncourse of action to be pursued in common. [455]\r\n\r\n[Nicholas in 1848.]\r\n\r\n[The Hungarian refugees, 1849.]\r\n\r\nNicholas, whether from policy or from a sense of kingly honour which at\r\nmost times powerfully influenced him, did not avail himself of the\r\nprostration of the Continental Powers in 1848 to attack Turkey. He detested\r\nrevolution, as a crime against the divinely ordered subjection of nations\r\nto their rulers, and would probably have felt himself degraded had he, in\r\nthe spirit of his predecessor Catherine, turned the calamities of his\r\nbrother-monarchs to his own separate advantage. It accorded better with his\r\nproud nature, possibly also with the schemes of a far-reaching policy, for\r\nRussia to enter the field as the protector of the Hapsburgs against the\r\nrebel Hungarians than for its armies to snatch from the Porte what the\r\nlapse of time and the goodwill of European allies would probably give to\r\nRussia at no distant date without a struggle. Disturbances at Bucharest and\r\nat Jassy led indeed to a Russian intervention in the Danubian\r\nPrincipalities in the interests of a despotic system of government; but\r\nRussia possessed by treaty protectorial rights over these Provinces. The\r\nmilitary occupation which followed the revolt against the Hospodars was the\r\nsubject of a convention between Turkey and Russia; it was effected by the\r\narmies of the two Powers jointly; and at the expiration of two years the\r\nRussian forces were peacefully withdrawn. More serious were the\r\ndifficulties which arose from the flight of Kossuth and other Hungarian\r\nleaders into Turkey after the subjugation of Hungary by the allied Austrian\r\nand Russian armies. The Courts of Vienna and St. Petersburg united in\r\ndemanding from the Porte the surrender of these refugees; the Sultan\r\nrefused to deliver them up, and he was energetically supported by Great\r\nBritain, Kossuth's children on their arrival at Constantinople being\r\nreceived and cared for at the British Embassy. The tyrannous demand of the\r\ntwo Emperors, the courageous resistance of the Sultan, excited the utmost\r\ninterest in Western Europe. By a strange turn of fortune, the Power which\r\nat the end of the last century had demanded from the Court of Vienna the\r\nGreek leader Rhegas, and had put him to death as soon as he was handed over\r\nby the Austrian police, was now gaining the admiration of all free nations\r\nas the last barrier that sheltered the champions of European liberty from\r\nthe vengeance of despotic might. The Czar and the Emperor of Austria had\r\nnot reckoned with the forces of public indignation aroused against them in\r\nthe West by their attempt to wrest their enemies from the Sultan's hand.\r\nThey withdrew their ambassadors from Constantinople and threatened to\r\nresort to force. But the appearance of the British and French fleets at the\r\nDardanelles gave a new aspect to the dispute. The Emperors learnt that if\r\nthey made war upon Turkey for the question at issue they would have to\r\nfight also against the Western Powers. The demand for the surrender of the\r\nrefugees was withdrawn; and in undertaking to keep the principal of them\r\nunder surveillance for a reasonable period, the Sultan gave to the two\r\nImperial Courts such satisfaction as they could, without loss of dignity,\r\naccept. [456]\r\n\r\n[Dispute between France and Russia on the Holy Places, 1850-2.]\r\n\r\nThe _coup d'état_ of Louis Napoleon at the end of the year 1851 was\r\nwitnessed by the Czar with sympathy and admiration as a service to the\r\ncause of order; but the assumption of the Imperial title by the Prince\r\ndispleased him exceedingly. While not refusing to recognise Napoleon III.,\r\nhe declined to address him by the term (_mon frère_) usually employed\r\nby monarchs in writing to one another. In addition to the question relating\r\nto the Hungarian refugees, a dispute concerning the Holy Places in\r\nPalestine threatened to cause strife between France and Russia. The same\r\nwave of religious and theological interest which in England produced the\r\nTractarian movement brought into the arena of political life in France an\r\nenthusiasm for the Church long strange to the Legislature and the governing\r\ncircles of Paris. In the Assembly of 1849 Montalembert, the spokesman of\r\nthis militant Catholicism, was one of the foremost figures. Louis Napoleon,\r\nas President, sought the favour of those whom Montalembert led; and the\r\nsame Government which restored the Pope to Rome demanded from the Porte a\r\nstricter enforcement of the rights of the Latin Church in the East. The\r\nearliest Christian legends had been localised in various spots around\r\nJerusalem. These had been in the ages of faith the goal of countless\r\npilgrimages, and in more recent centuries they had formed the object of\r\ntreaties between the Porte and France. Greek monks, however, disputed\r\nwith Latin monks for the guardianship of the Holy Places; and as the\r\npower of Russia grew, the privileges of the Greek monks had increased.\r\nThe claims of the rival brotherhoods, which related to doors, keys, stars\r\nand lamps, might probably have been settled to the satisfaction of all\r\nparties within a few hours by an experienced stage-manager; in the hands\r\nof diplomatists bent on obtaining triumphs over one another they assumed\r\ndimensions that overshadowed the peace of Europe. The French and the\r\nRussian Ministers at Constantinople alternately tormented the Sultan in\r\nthe character of aggrieved sacristans, until, at the beginning of 1852,\r\nthe Porte compromised itself with both parties by adjudging to each\r\nrights which it professed also to secure to the other. A year more, spent\r\nin prevarications, in excuses, and in menaces, ended with the triumph of\r\nthe French, with the evasion of the promises made by the Sultan to\r\nRussia, and with the discomfiture of the Greek Church in the person of\r\nthe monks who officiated at the Holy Sepulchre and the Shrine of the\r\nNativity. [457]\r\n\r\n[Nicholas and Sir H. Seymour, Jan., Feb., 1853.]\r\n\r\nNicholas treated the conduct of the Porte as an outrage upon himself. A\r\nconflict which had broken out between the Sultan and the Montenegrins, and\r\nwhich now threatened to take a deadly form, confirmed the Czar in his\r\nbelief that the time for resolute action had arrived. At the beginning of\r\nthe year 1853 he addressed himself to Hamilton Seymour, British ambassador\r\nat St. Petersburg, in terms much stronger and clearer than those which he\r\nhad used towards Lord Aberdeen nine years before. \"The Sick Man,\" he said,\r\n\"was in extremities; the time had come for a clear understanding between\r\nEngland and Russia. The occupation of Constantinople by Russian troops\r\nmight be necessary, but the Czar would not hold it permanently. He would\r\nnot permit any other Power to establish itself at the Bosphorus, neither\r\nwould he permit the Ottoman Empire to be broken up into Republics to afford\r\na refuge to the Mazzinis and the Kossuths of Europe. The Danubian\r\nPrincipalities were already independent States under Russian protection.\r\nThe other possessions of the Sultan north of the Balkans might be placed on\r\nthe same footing. England might annex Egypt and Crete.\" After making this\r\ncommunication to the British ambassador, and receiving the reply that\r\nEngland declined to enter into any schemes based on the fall of the Turkish\r\nEmpire and disclaimed all desire for the annexation of any part of the\r\nSultan's dominions, Nicholas despatched Prince Menschikoff to\r\nConstantinople, to demand from the Porte not only an immediate settlement\r\nof the questions relating to the Holy Places, but a Treaty guaranteeing to\r\nthe Greek Church the undisturbed enjoyment of all its ancient rights and\r\nthe benefit of all privileges that might be accorded by the Porte to any\r\nother Christian communities. [458]\r\n\r\n[The Claims of Russia.]\r\n\r\nThe Treaty which Menschikoff was instructed to demand would have placed the\r\nSultan and the Czar in the position of contracting parties with regard to\r\nthe entire body of rights and privileges enjoyed by the Sultan's subjects\r\nof the Greek confession, and would so have made the violation of these\r\nrights in the case of any individual Christian a matter entitling Russia to\r\ninterfere, or to claim satisfaction as for the breach of a Treaty\r\nengagement. By the Treaty of Kainardjie (1774) the Sultan had indeed bound\r\nhimself \"to protect the Christian religion and its Churches\"; but this\r\nphrase was too indistinct to create specific matter of Treaty-obligation;\r\nand if it had given to Russia any general right of interference on behalf\r\nof members of the Greek Church, it would have given it the same right in\r\nbehalf of all the Roman Catholics and all the Protestants in the Sultan's\r\ndominions, a right which the Czars had never professed to enjoy. Moreover,\r\nthe Treaty of Kainardjie itself forbade by implication any such\r\nconstruction, for it mentioned by name one ecclesiastical building for\r\nwhose priests the Porte did concede to Russia the right of addressing\r\nrepresentations to the Sultan. Over the Danubian Principalities Russia\r\npossessed by the Treaty of Adrianople undoubted protectorial rights; but\r\nthese Provinces stood on a footing quite different from that of the\r\nremainder of the Empire. That the Greek Church possessed by custom and by\r\nenactment privileges which it was the duty of the Sultan to respect, no one\r\ncontested: the novelty of Menschikoff's claim was that the observation of\r\nthese rights should be made matter of Treaty with Russia. The importance of\r\nthe demand was proved by the fact that Menschikoff strictly forbade the\r\nTurkish Ministers to reveal it to the other Powers, and that Nicholas\r\ncaused the English Government to be informed that the mission of his envoy\r\nhad no other object than the final adjustment of the difficulties\r\nrespecting the Holy Places. [459]\r\n\r\n[Lord Stratford de Redcliffe.]\r\n\r\n[Menschikoff leaves Constantinople, May 21.]\r\n\r\n[Russian troops enter the Principalities.]\r\n\r\nWhen Menschikoff reached Constantinople the British Embassy was in the\r\nhands of a subordinate officer. The Ambassador, Sir Stratford Canning, had\r\nrecently returned to England. Stratford Canning, a cousin of the Premier,\r\nhad been employed in the East at intervals since 1810. There had been a\r\nperiod in his career when he had desired to see the Turk expelled from\r\nEurope as an incurable barbarian; but the reforms of Sultan Mahmud had at a\r\nlater time excited his warm interest and sympathy, and as Ambassador at\r\nConstantinople from 1842 to 1852 he had laboured strenuously for the\r\nregeneration of the Turkish Empire, and for the improvement of the\r\ncondition of the Christian races under the Sultan's rule. His dauntless,\r\nsustained energy, his noble presence, the sincerity of his friendship\r\ntowards the Porte, gave him an influence at Constantinople seldom, if ever,\r\nexercised by a foreign statesman. There were moments when he seemed to be\r\nachieving results of some value; but the task which he had attempted was\r\none that surpassed human power; and after ten years so spent as to win for\r\nhim the fame of the greatest ambassador by whom England has been\r\nrepresented in modern times, he declared that the prospects of Turkish\r\nreform were hopeless, and left Constantinople, not intending to return.\r\n[460] Before his successor had been appointed, the mission of Prince\r\nMenschikoff, the violence of his behaviour at Constantinople, and a rumour\r\nthat he sought far more than his ostensible object, alarmed the British\r\nGovernment. Canning was asked to resume his post. Returning to\r\nConstantinople as Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, he communicated on his\r\njourney with the Courts of Paris and Vienna, and carried with him authority\r\nto order the Admiral of the fleet at Malta to hold his ships in readiness\r\nto sail for the East. He arrived at the Bosphorus on April 5th, learnt at\r\nonce the real situation of affairs, and entered into negotiation with\r\nMenschikoff. The Russian, a mere child in diplomacy in comparison with his\r\nrival, suffered himself to be persuaded to separate the question of the\r\nHoly Places from that of the guarantee of the rights of the Greek Church.\r\nIn the first matter Russia had a good cause; in the second it was advancing\r\na new claim. The two being dissociated, Stratford had no difficulty in\r\nnegotiating a compromise on the Holy Places satisfactory to the Czar's\r\nrepresentative; and the demand for the Protectorate over the Greek\r\nChristians now stood out unobscured by those grievances of detail with\r\nwhich it had been at first interwoven. Stratford encouraged the Turkish\r\nGovernment to reject the Russian proposal. Knowing, nevertheless, that\r\nMenschikoff would in the last resort endeavour to intimidate the Sultan\r\npersonally, he withheld from the Ministers, in view of this last peril, the\r\nstrongest of all his arguments; and seeking a private audience with the\r\nSultan on the 9th of May, he made known to him with great solemnity the\r\nauthority which he had received to order the fleet at Malta to be in\r\nreadiness to sail. The Sultan placed the natural interpretation on this\r\nstatement, and ordered final rejection of Menschikoff's demand, though the\r\nRussian had consented to a modification of its form, and would now have\r\naccepted a note declaratory of the intentions of the Sultan towards the\r\nGreek Church instead of a regular Treaty. On the 21st of May Menschikoff\r\nquitted Constantinople; and the Czar, declaring that some guarantee must be\r\nheld by Russia for the maintenance of the rights of the Greek Christians,\r\nannounced that he should order his army to occupy the Danubian Provinces.\r\nAfter an interval of some weeks the Russian troops crossed the Pruth, and\r\nspread themselves over Moldavia and Wallachia. (June 22nd.) [461]\r\n\r\n[English Policy.]\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary course of affairs the invasion of the territory of one\r\nEmpire by the troops of another is, and can be nothing else than, an act of\r\nwar, necessitating hostilities as a measure of defence on the part of the\r\nPower invaded. But the Czar protested that in taking the Danubian\r\nPrincipalities in pledge he had no intention of violating the peace; and as\r\nyet the common sense of the Turks, as well as the counsels that they\r\nreceived from without, bade them hesitate before issuing a declaration of\r\nwar. Since December, 1852, Lord Aberdeen had been Prime Minister of\r\nEngland, at the head of a Cabinet formed by a coalition between followers\r\nof Sir Robert Peel and the Whig leaders Palmerston and Russell. [462] There\r\nwas no man in England more pacific in disposition, or more anxious to\r\nremain on terms of honourable friendship with Russia, than Lord Aberdeen.\r\nThe Czar had justly reckoned on the Premier's own forbearance; but he had\r\nfailed to recognise the strength of those forces which, both within and\r\nwithout the Cabinet, set in the direction of armed resistance to Russia.\r\nPalmerston was keen for action. Lord Stratford appears to have taken it for\r\ngranted from the first that, if a war should arise between the Sultan and\r\nthe Czar in consequence of the rejection of Menschikoff's demand, Great\r\nBritain would fight in defence of the Ottoman Empire. He had not stated\r\nthis in express terms, but the communication which he made to the Sultan\r\nregarding his own instructions could only have been intended to convey this\r\nimpression. If the fleet was not to defend the Sultan, it was a mere piece\r\nof deceit to inform him that the Ambassador had powers to place it in\r\nreadiness to sail; and such deceit was as alien to the character of Lord\r\nStratford as the assumption of a virtual engagement towards the Sultan was\r\nin keeping with his imperious will and his passionate conviction of the\r\nduty of England. From the date of Lord Stratford's visit to the Palace,\r\nalthough no Treaty or agreement was in existence, England stood bound in\r\nhonour, so long as the Turks should pursue the policy laid down by her\r\nenvoy, to fulfil the expectations which this envoy had held out.\r\n\r\n[British and French fleets moved to Besika Bay, July, 1853.]\r\n\r\n[The Vienna Note, July 28.]\r\n\r\n[Constantinople in September.]\r\n\r\n[British and French fleets pass the Dardanelles, Oct. 22.]\r\n\r\nHad Lord Stratford been at the head of the Government, the policy and\r\nintentions of Great Britain would no doubt have been announced with such\r\ndistinctness that the Czar could have fostered no misapprehension as to the\r\nresults of his own acts. Palmerston, as Premier, would probably have\r\nadopted the same clear course, and war would either have been avoided by\r\nthis nation or have been made with a distinct purpose and on a definite\r\nissue. But the Cabinet of Lord Aberdeen was at variance with itself.\r\nAberdeen was ready to go to all lengths in negotiation, but he was not\r\nsufficiently master of his colleagues and of the representatives of England\r\nabroad to prevent acts and declarations which in themselves brought war\r\nnear; above all, he failed to require from Turkey that abstention from\r\nhostilities on which, so long as negotiations lasted, England and the other\r\nPowers which proposed to make the cause of the Porte their own ought\r\nunquestionably to have insisted. On the announcement by the Czar that his\r\narmy was about to enter the Principalities, the British Government\r\ndespatched the fleet to Besika Bay near the entrance to the Dardanelles,\r\nand authorised Stratford to call it to the Bosphorus, in case\r\nConstantinople should be attacked. [463] The French fleet, which had come\r\ninto Greek waters on Menschikoff's appearance at Constantinople, took up\r\nthe same position. Meanwhile European diplomacy was busily engaged in\r\nframing schemes of compromise between the Porte and Russia. The\r\nrepresentatives of the four Powers met at Vienna, and agreed upon a note\r\nwhich, as they considered, would satisfy any legitimate claims of Russia on\r\nbehalf of the Greek Church, and at the same time impose upon the Sultan no\r\nfurther obligations towards Russia than those which already existed. [464]\r\nThis note, however, was ill drawn, and would have opened the door to new\r\nclaims on the part of Russia to a general Protectorate not sanctioned by\r\nits authors. The draft was sent to St. Petersburg, and was accepted by the\r\nCzar. At Constantinople its ambiguities were at once recognised; and though\r\nLord Stratford in his official capacity urged its acceptance under a\r\nEuropean guarantee against misconstruction, the Divan, now under the\r\npressure of strong patriotic forces, refused to accept the note unless\r\ncertain changes were made in its expressions. France, England, and Austria\r\nunited in recommending to the Court of St. Petersburg the adoption of these\r\namendments. The Czar, however, declined to admit them, and a Russian\r\ndocument, which obtained a publicity for which it was not intended, proved\r\nthat the construction of the note which the amendments were expressly\r\ndesigned to exclude was precisely that which Russia meant to place upon it.\r\nThe British Ministry now refused to recommend the note any longer to the\r\nPorte. [465] Austria, while it approved of the amendments, did not consider\r\nthat their rejection by the Czar justified England in abandoning the note\r\nas the common award of the European Powers; and thus the concert of Europe\r\nwas interrupted, England and France combining in a policy which Austria and\r\nPrussia were not willing to follow. In proportion as the chances of joint\r\nEuropean action diminished, the ardour of the Turks themselves, and of\r\nthose who were to be their allies, rose higher. Tumults, organised by the\r\nheads of the war-party, broke out at Constantinople; and although Stratford\r\nscorned the alarms of his French colleagues, who reported that a massacre\r\nof the Europeans in the capital was imminent, he thought it necessary to\r\ncall up two vessels of war in order to provide for the security of the\r\nEnglish residents and of the Sultan himself. In England Palmerston and the\r\nmen of action in the Cabinet dragged Lord Aberdeen with them. The French\r\nGovernment pressed for vigorous measures, and in conformity with its desire\r\ninstructions were sent from London to Lord Stratford to call the fleet to\r\nthe Bosphorus, and to employ it in defending the territory of the Sultan\r\nagainst aggression. On the 22nd of October the British and French fleets\r\npassed the Dardanelles.\r\n\r\n[The ultimatum of Omar Pasha rejected, Oct. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Turkish squadron destroyed at Sinope, Nov. 30.]\r\n\r\nThe Turk, sure of the protection of the Western Powers, had for some weeks\r\nresolved upon war; and yet the possibilities of a diplomatic settlement\r\nwere not yet exhausted. Stratford himself had forwarded to Vienna the draft\r\nof an independent note which the Sultan was prepared to accept. This had\r\nnot yet been seen at St. Petersburg. Other projects of conciliation filled\r\nthe desks of all the leading politicians of Europe. Yet, though the belief\r\ngenerally existed that some scheme could be framed by which the Sultan,\r\nwithout sacrifice of his dignity and interest, might induce the Czar to\r\nevacuate the Principalities, no serious attempt was made to prevent the\r\nTurks from coming into collision with their enemies both by land and sea.\r\nThe commander of the Russian troops in the Principalities having, on the\r\n10th of October, rejected an ultimatum requiring him to withdraw within\r\nfifteen days, this answer was taken as the signal for the commencement of\r\nhostilities. The Czar met the declaration of war with a statement that he\r\nwould abstain from taking the offensive, and would continue merely to hold\r\nthe Principalities as a material guarantee. Omar Pasha, the Ottoman\r\ncommander in Bulgaria, was not permitted to observe the same passive\r\nattitude. Crossing the Danube, he attacked and defeated the Russians at\r\nOltenitza. Thus assailed, the Czar considered that his engagement not to\r\nact on the offensive was at an end, and the Russian fleet, issuing from\r\nSebastopol, attacked and destroyed a Turkish squadron in the harbour of\r\nSinope on the southern coast of the Black Sea (November 30). The action was\r\na piece of gross folly on the part of the Russian authorities if they still\r\ncherished the hopes of pacification which the Czar professed; but others\r\nalso were at fault. Lord Stratford and the British Admiral, if they could\r\nnot prevent the Turkish ships from remaining in the Euxine, where they were\r\nuseless against the superior force of Russia, might at least in exercise of\r\nthe powers given to them have sent a sufficient escort to prevent an\r\nencounter. But the same ill-fortune and incompleteness that had marked all\r\nthe diplomacy of the previous months attended the counsels of the Admirals\r\nat the Bosphorus; and the disaster of Sinope rendered war between the\r\nWestern Powers and Russia almost inevitable. [466]\r\n\r\n[Effect of the action at Sinope.]\r\n\r\n[Russian ships required to enter port, December.]\r\n\r\n[England and France declare war, March 27, 1854.]\r\n\r\nThe Turks themselves had certainly not understood the declaration of the\r\nEmperor Nicholas as assuring their squadron at Sinope against attack; and\r\nso far was the Ottoman Admiral from being the victim of a surprise that he\r\nhad warned his Government some days before of the probability of his own\r\ndestruction. But to the English people, indignant with Russia since its\r\ndestruction of Hungarian liberty and its tyrannous demand for the surrender\r\nof the Hungarian refugees, all that now passed heaped up the intolerable\r\nsum of autocratic violence and deceit. The cannonade which was continued\r\nagainst the Turkish crews at Sinope long after they had become defenceless\r\ngave to the battle the aspect of a massacre; the supposed promise of the\r\nCzar to act only on the defensive caused it to be denounced as an act of\r\nflagrant treachery; the circumstance that the Turkish fleet was lying\r\nwithin one of the Sultan's harbours, touching as it were the territory\r\nwhich the navy of England had undertaken to protect, imparted to the attack\r\nthe character of a direct challenge and defiance to England. The cry rose\r\nloud for war. Napoleon, eager for the alliance with England, eager in\r\nconjunction with England to play a great part before Europe, even at the\r\ncost of a war from which France had nothing to gain, proposed that the\r\ncombined fleets should pass the Bosphorus and require every Russian vessel\r\nsailing on the Black Sea to re-enter port. His proposal was adopted by the\r\nBritish Government. Nicholas learnt that the Russian flag was swept from\r\nthe Euxine. It was in vain that a note upon which the representatives of\r\nthe Powers at Vienna had once more agreed was accepted by the Porte and\r\nforwarded to St. Petersburg (December 31). The pride of the Czar was\r\nwounded beyond endurance, and at the beginning of February he recalled his\r\nambassadors from London and Paris. A letter written to him by Napoleon\r\nIII., demanding in the name of himself and the Queen of England the\r\nevacuation of the Principalities, was answered by a reference to the\r\ncampaign of Moscow, Austria now informed the Western Powers that if they\r\nwould fix a delay for the evacuation of the Principalities, the expiration\r\nof which should be the signal for hostilities, it would support the\r\nsummons; and without waiting to learn whether Austria would also unite with\r\nthem in hostilities in the event of the summons being rejected, the British\r\nand French Governments despatched their ultimatum to St. Petersburg.\r\nAustria and Prussia sought, but in vain, to reconcile the Court of St.\r\nPetersburg to the only measure by which peace could now be preserved. The\r\nultimatum remained without an answer, and on the 27th of March England and\r\nFrance declared war.\r\n\r\n[Policy of Austria.]\r\n\r\nThe Czar had at one time believed that in his Eastern schemes he was sure\r\nof the support of Austria; and he had strong reasons for supposing himself\r\nentitled to its aid. But his mode of thought was simpler than that of the\r\nCourt of Vienna. Schwarzenberg, when it was remarked that the intervention\r\nof Russia in Hungary would bind the House of Hapsburg too closely to its\r\nprotector, had made the memorable answer, \"We will astonish the world by\r\nour ingratitude.\" It is possible that an instance of Austrian gratitude\r\nwould have astonished the world most of all; but Schwarzenberg's successors\r\nwere not the men to sacrifice a sound principle to romance. Two courses of\r\nEastern policy have, under various modifications, had their advocates in\r\nrival schools of statesmen at Vienna. The one is that of expansion\r\nsouthward in concert with Russia; the other is that of resistance to the\r\nextension of Russian power, and the consequent maintenance of the integrity\r\nof the Ottoman Empire. During Metternich's long rule, inspired as this was\r\nby a faith in the Treaties and the institutions of 1815, and by the dread\r\nof every living, disturbing force, the second of these systems had been\r\nconsistently followed. In 1854 the determining motive of the Court of\r\nVienna was not a decided political conviction, but the certainty that if it\r\nunited with Russia it would be brought into war with the Western Powers.\r\nHad Russia and Turkey been likely to remain alone in the arena, an\r\narrangement for territorial compensation would possibly, as on some other\r\noccasions, have won for the Czar an Austrian alliance. Combination against\r\nTurkey was, however, at the present time, too perilous an enterprise for\r\nthe Austrian monarchy; and, as nothing was to be gained through the war, it\r\nremained for the Viennese diplomatists to see that nothing was lost and as\r\nlittle as possible wasted. The presence of Russian troops in the\r\nPrincipalities, where they controlled the Danube in its course between the\r\nHungarian frontier and the Black Sea, was, in default of some definite\r\nunderstanding, a danger to Austria; and Count Buol, the Minister at Vienna,\r\nhad therefore every reason to thank the Western Powers for insisting on the\r\nevacuation of this district. When France and England were burning to take\r\nup arms, it would have been a piece of superfluous brutality towards the\r\nCzar for Austria to attach to its own demand for the evacuation of the\r\nPrincipalities the threat of war. But this evacuation Austria was\r\ndetermined to enforce. It refused, as did Prussia, to give to the Czar the\r\nassurance of its neutrality; and, inasmuch as the free navigation of the\r\nDanube as far as the Black Sea had now become recognised as one of the\r\ncommercial interests of Germany at large, Prussia and the German Federation\r\nundertook to protect the territory of Austria, if, in taking the measures\r\nnecessary to free the Principalities, it should itself be attacked by\r\nRussia. [467]\r\n\r\n[Prussia.]\r\n\r\nThe King of Prussia, clouded as his mind was by political and religious\r\nphantasms, had nevertheless at times a larger range of view than his\r\nneighbours; and his opinion as to the true solution of the difficulties\r\nbetween Nicholas and the Porte, at the time of Menschikoff's mission,\r\ndeserved more attention than it received. Frederick William proposed that\r\nthe rights of the Christian subjects of the Sultan should be placed by\r\nTreaty under the guarantee of all the Great Powers. This project was\r\nopposed by Lord Stratford and the Turkish Ministers as an encroachment on\r\nthe Sultan's sovereignty, and its rejection led the King to write with some\r\nasperity to his ambassador in London that he should seek the welfare of\r\nPrussia in absolute neutrality. [468] At a later period the King demanded\r\nfrom England, as the condition of any assistance from himself, a guarantee\r\nfor the maintenance of the frontiers of Germany and Prussia. He regarded\r\nNapoleon III. as the representative of a revolutionary system, and believed\r\nthat under him French armies would soon endeavour to overthrow the order of\r\nEurope established in 1815. That England should enter into a close alliance\r\nwith this man excited the King's astonishment and disgust; and unless the\r\nCabinet of London were prepared to give a guarantee against any future\r\nattack on Germany by the French Emperor, who was believed to be ready for\r\nevery political adventure, it was vain for England to seek Prussia's aid.\r\nLord Aberdeen could give no such guarantee; still less could he gratify the\r\nKing's strangely passionate demand for the restoration of his authority in\r\nthe Swiss canton of Neuchâtel, which before 1848 had belonged in name to\r\nthe Hohenzollerns. Many influences were brought to bear upon the King from\r\nthe side both of England and of Russia. The English Court and Ministers,\r\nstrenuously supported by Bunsen, the Prussian ambassador, strove to enlist\r\nthe King in an active concert of Europe against Russia by dwelling on the\r\nduties of Prussia as a Great Power and the dangers arising to it from\r\nisolation. On the other hand, the admiration felt by Frederick William for\r\nthe Emperor Nicholas, and the old habitual friendship between Prussia and\r\nRussia, gave strength to the Czar's advocates at Berlin. Schemes for a\r\nreconstruction of Europe, which were devised by Napoleon, and supposed to\r\nreceive some countenance from Palmerston, reached the King's ear. [469] He\r\nheard that Austria was to be offered the Danubian Provinces upon condition\r\nof giving up northern Italy; that Piedmont was to receive Lombardy, and in\r\nreturn to surrender Savoy to France; that, if Austria should decline to\r\nunite actively with the Western Powers, revolutionary movements were to be\r\nstirred up in Italy and in Hungary. Such reports kindled the King's rage.\r\n\"Be under no illusion,\" he wrote to his ambassador; \"tell the British\r\nMinisters in their private ear and on the housetops that I will not suffer\r\nAustria to be attacked by the revolution without drawing the sword in its\r\ndefence. If England and France let loose revolution as their ally, be it\r\nwhere it may, I unite with Russia for life and death.\" Bunsen advocated the\r\nparticipation of Prussia in the European concert with more earnestness than\r\nsuccess. While the King was declaiming against the lawlessness which was\r\nsupposed to have spread from the Tuileries to Downing Street, Bunsen, on\r\nhis own authority, sent to Berlin a project for the annexation of Russian\r\nterritory by Prussia as a reward for its alliance with the Western Courts.\r\nThis document fell into the hands of the Russian party at Berlin, and it\r\nroused the King's own indignation. Bitter reproaches were launched against\r\nthe authors of so felonious a scheme. Bunsen could no longer retain his\r\noffice. Other advocates of the Western alliance were dismissed from their\r\nplaces, and the policy of neutrality carried the day at Berlin.\r\n\r\n[Relation of the Western Powers to the European Concert.]\r\n\r\nThe situation of the European Powers in April, 1854, was thus a very\r\nstrange one. All the Four Powers were agreed in demanding the evacuation of\r\nthe Principalities by Russia, and in the resolution to enforce this, if\r\nnecessary, by arms. Protocols witnessing this agreement were signed on the\r\n9th of April and the 23rd of May, [470] and it was moreover declared that\r\nthe Four Powers recognised the necessity of maintaining the independence\r\nand the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. But France and England, while they\r\nmade the presence of the Russians in the Principalities the avowed cause of\r\nwar, had in reality other intentions than the mere expulsion of the\r\nintruder and the restoration of the state of things previously existing. It\r\nwas their desire so to cripple Russia that it should not again be in a\r\ncondition to menace the Ottoman Empire. This intention made it impossible\r\nfor the British Cabinet to name, as the basis of a European league, that\r\nsingle definite object for which, and for which alone, all the Powers were\r\nin May, 1854, ready to unite in arms. England, the nation and the\r\nGovernment alike, chose rather to devote itself, in company with France, to\r\nthe task of indefinitely weakening Russia than, in company with all Europe,\r\nto force Russia to one humiliating but inevitable act of submission.\r\nWhether in the prosecution of their ulterior objects the Western Courts\r\nmight or might not receive some armed assistance from Austria and Prussia\r\nno man could yet predict with confidence. That Austria would to some extent\r\nmake common cause with the Allies seemed not unlikely; that Prussia would\r\ndo so there was no real ground to believe; on the contrary, fair warning\r\nhad been given that there were contingencies in which Prussia might\r\nultimately be found on the side of the Czar. Striving to the utmost to\r\ndiscover some principle, some object, or even some formula which might\r\nexpand the purely defensive basis accepted by Austria and Prussia into a\r\ncommon policy of reconstructive action, the Western Powers could obtain\r\nnothing more definite from the Conference at Vienna than the following\r\nshadowy engagement:--\"The Four Governments engage to endeavour in common to\r\ndiscover the guarantees most likely to attach the existence of the Ottoman\r\nEmpire to the general equilibrium of Europe. They are ready to deliberate\r\nas to the employment of means calculated to accomplish the object of their\r\nagreement.\" This readiness to deliberate, so cautiously professed, was a\r\nquality in which during the two succeeding years the Courts of Vienna and\r\nBerlin were not found wanting; but the war in which England and France now\r\nengaged was one which they had undertaken at their own risk, and they\r\ndiscovered little anxiety on any side to share their labour.\r\n\r\n[Siege of Silistria, May.]\r\n\r\n[The Principalities evacuated, June.]\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1853 and the first weeks of the following year\r\nhostilities of an indecisive character continued between the Turks and the\r\nRussians on the Danube. At the outbreak of the war Nicholas had consulted\r\nthe veteran Paskiewitsch as to the best road by which to march on\r\nConstantinople. Paskiewitsch, as a strategist, knew the danger to which a\r\nRussian force crossing the Danube would be exposed from the presence of\r\nAustrian armies on its flank; as commander in the invasion of Hungary in\r\n1849 he had encountered, as he believed, ill faith and base dealing on the\r\npart of his ally, and had repaid it with insult and scorn; he had learnt\r\nbetter than any other man the military and the moral weakness of the\r\nAustrian Empire in its eastern part. His answer to the Czar's inquiries\r\nwas, \"The road to Constantinople lies through Vienna.\" But whatever\r\nbitterness the Czar might have felt at the ingratitude of Francis Joseph,\r\nhe was not ready for a war with Austria, in which he could hardly have\r\navoided the assistance of revolutionary allies; moreover, if the road to\r\nConstantinople lay through Vienna, it might be urged that the road to\r\nVienna lay through Berlin. The simpler plan was adopted of a march on the\r\nBalkans by way of Shumla, to which the capture of Silistria was to be the\r\nprelude. At the end of March the Russian vanguard passed the Danube at the\r\nlowest point where a crossing could be made, and advanced into the\r\nDobrudscha. In May the siege of Silistria was undertaken by Paskiewitsch\r\nhimself. But the enterprise began too late, and the strength employed both\r\nin the siege and in the field operations farther east was insufficient. The\r\nTurkish garrison, schooled by a German engineer and animated by two young\r\nEnglish officers, maintained a stubborn and effective resistance. French\r\nand English troops had already landed at Gallipoli for the defence of\r\nConstantinople, and finding no enemy within range had taken ship for Varna\r\non the north of the Balkans. Austria, on the 3rd of June, delivered its\r\nsummons requiring the evacuation of the Principalities. Almost at the same\r\ntime Paskiewitsch received a wound that disabled him, and was forced to\r\nsurrender his command into other hands. During the succeeding fortnight the\r\nbesiegers of Silistria were repeatedly driven back, and on the 22nd they\r\nwere compelled to raise the siege. The Russians, now hard pressed by an\r\nenemy whom they had despised, withdrew to the north of the Danube. The\r\nretreating movement was continued during the succeeding weeks, until the\r\nevacuation of the Principalities was complete, and the last Russian soldier\r\nhad recrossed the Pruth. As the invader retired, Austria sent its troops\r\ninto these provinces, pledging itself by a convention with the Porte to\r\nprotect them until peace should be concluded, and then to restore them to\r\nthe Sultan.\r\n\r\n[Further objects of the Western Powers.]\r\n\r\nWith the liberation of the Principalities the avowed ground of war passed\r\naway; but the Western Powers had no intention of making peace without\r\nfurther concessions on the part of Russia. As soon as the siege of\r\nSilistria was raised instructions were sent to the commanders of the allied\r\narmies at Varna, pressing, if not absolutely commanding, them to attack\r\nSebastopol, the headquarters of Russian maritime power in the Euxine. The\r\ncapture of Sebastopol had been indicated some months before by Napoleon\r\nIII. as the most effective blow that could be dealt to Russia. It was from\r\nSebastopol that the fleet had issued which destroyed the Turks at Sinope:\r\nuntil this arsenal had fallen, the growing naval might which pressed even\r\nmore directly upon Constantinople than the neighbourhood of the Czar's\r\narmies by land could not be permanently laid low. The objects sought by\r\nEngland and France were now gradually brought into sufficient clearness to\r\nbe communicated to the other Powers, though the more precise interpretation\r\nof the conditions laid down remained open for future discussion. It was\r\nannounced that the Protectorate of Russia over the Danubian Principalities\r\nand Servia must be abolished; that the navigation of the Danube at its\r\nmouths must be freed from all obstacles; that the Treaty of July, 1841,\r\nrelating to the Black Sea and the Dardanelles, must be revised in the\r\ninterest of the balance of power in Europe; and that the claim to any\r\nofficial Protectorate over Christian subjects of the Porte, of whatever\r\nrite, must be abandoned by the Czar. Though these conditions, known as the\r\nFour Points, were not approved by Prussia, they were accepted by Austria in\r\nAugust, 1854, and were laid before Russia as the basis of any negotiation\r\nfor peace. The Czar declared in answer that Russia would only negotiate on\r\nsuch a basis when at the last extremity. The Allied Governments, measuring\r\ntheir enemy's weakness by his failure before Silistria, were determined to\r\naccept nothing less; and the attack upon Sebastopol, ordered before the\r\nevacuation of the Principalities, was consequently allowed to take its\r\ncourse. [471]\r\n\r\n[Sebastopol.]\r\n\r\n[The Allies land in the Crimea, Sept. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Battle of the Alma, Sept. 20.]\r\n\r\nThe Roadstead, or Great Harbour, of Sebastopol runs due eastwards inland\r\nfrom a point not far from the south-western extremity of the Crimea. One\r\nmile from the open sea its waters divide, the larger arm still running\r\neastwards till it meets the River Tchernaya, the smaller arm, known as the\r\nMan-of-War Harbour, bending sharply to the south. On both sides of this\r\nsmaller harbour Sebastopol is built. To the seaward, that is from the\r\nsmaller harbour westwards, Sebastopol and its approaches were thoroughly\r\nfortified. On its landward, southern, side the town had been open till\r\n1853, and it was still but imperfectly protected, most weakly on the\r\nsouth-eastern side. On the north of the Great Harbour Fort Constantine at\r\nthe head of a line of strong defences guarded the entrance from the sea;\r\nwhile on the high ground immediately opposite Sebastopol and commanding the\r\ntown there stood the Star Fort with other military constructions. The\r\ngeneral features of Sebastopol were known to the Allied commanders; they\r\nhad, however, no precise information as to the force by which it was held,\r\nnor as to the armament of its fortifications. It was determined that the\r\nlanding should be made in the Bay of Eupatoria, thirty miles north of the\r\nfortress. Here, on the 14th of September, the Allied forces, numbering\r\nabout thirty thousand French, twenty-seven thousand English, and seven\r\nthousand Turks, effected their disembarkation without meeting any\r\nresistance. The Russians, commanded by Prince Menschikoff, lately envoy at\r\nConstantinople, had taken post ten miles further south on high ground\r\nbehind the River Alma. On the 20th of September they were attacked in front\r\nby the English, while the French attempted a turning movement from the sea.\r\nThe battle was a scene of confusion, and for a moment the assault of the\r\nEnglish seemed to be rolled back. But it was renewed with ever increasing\r\nvigour, and before the French had made any impression on the Russian left\r\nLord Raglan's troops had driven the enemy from their positions. Struck on\r\nthe flank when their front was already broken, outnumbered and badly led,\r\nthe Russians gave up all for lost. The form of an orderly retreat was\r\nmaintained only long enough to disguise from the conquerors the\r\ncompleteness of their victory. When night fell the Russian army abandoned\r\nitself to total disorder, and had the pursuit been made at once it could\r\nscarcely have escaped destruction. But St. Arnaud, who was in the last\r\nstage of mortal illness, refused, in spite of the appeal of Lord Raglan, to\r\npress on his wearied troops. Menschikoff, abandoning the hope of checking\r\nthe advance of the Allies in a second battle, and anxious only to prevent\r\nthe capture of Sebastopol by an enemy supposed to be following at his\r\nheels, retired into the fortress, and there sank seven of his war-ships as\r\na barrier across the mouth of the Great Harbour, mooring the rest within.\r\nThe crews were brought on shore to serve in the defence by land; the guns\r\nwere dragged from the ships to the bastions and redoubts. Then, when it\r\nappeared that the Allies lingered, the Russian commander altered his plan.\r\nLeaving Korniloff, the Vice-Admiral, and Todleben, an officer of engineers,\r\nto man the existing works and to throw up new ones where the town was\r\nundefended, Menschikoff determined to lead off the bulk of his army into\r\nthe interior of the Crimea, in order to keep open his communications with\r\nRussia, to await in freedom the arrival of reinforcements, and, if\r\nSebastopol should not at once fall, to attack the Allies at his own time\r\nand opportunity. (September 24th.)\r\n\r\n[Flank march to south of Sebastopol.]\r\n\r\n[Ineffectual Bombardment, Sept. 17-25.]\r\n\r\nThe English had lost in the battle of the Alma about two thousand men, the\r\nFrench probably less than half that number. On the morning after the\r\nengagement Lord Raglan proposed that the two armies should march straight\r\nagainst the fortifications lying on the north of the Great Harbour, and\r\ncarry these by storm, so winning a position where their guns would command\r\nSebastopol itself. The French, supported by Burgoyne, the chief of the\r\nEnglish engineers, shrank from the risk of a front attack on works supposed\r\nto be more formidable than they really were, and induced Lord Raglan to\r\nconsent to a long circuitous march which would bring the armies right round\r\nSebastopol to its more open southern side, from which, it was thought, an\r\nassault might be successfully made. This flank-march, which was one of\r\nextreme risk, was carried out safely, Menschikoff himself having left\r\nSebastopol, and having passed along the same road in his retreat into the\r\ninterior a little before the appearance of the Allies. Pushing southward,\r\nthe English reached the sea at Balaclava, and took possession of the\r\nharbour there, accepting the exposed eastward line between the fortress and\r\nthe Russia is outside; the French, now commanded by Canrobert, continued\r\ntheir march westwards round the back of Sebastopol, and touched the sea at\r\nKasatch Bay. The two armies were thus masters of the broken plateau which,\r\nrising westwards from the plain of Balaclava and the valley of the\r\nTchernaya, overlooks Sebastopol on its southern side. That the garrison,\r\nwhich now consisted chiefly of sailors, could at this moment have resisted\r\nthe onslaught of the fifty thousand troops who had won the battle of the\r\nAlma, the Russians themselves did not believe; [472] but once more the\r\nFrench staff, with Burgoyne, urged caution, and it was determined to wait\r\nfor the siege-guns, which were still at sea. The decision was a fatal one.\r\nWhile the Allies chose positions for their heavy artillery and slowly\r\nlanded and placed their guns, Korniloff and Todleben made the\r\nfortifications on the southern side of Sebastopol an effective barrier\r\nbefore an enemy. The sacrifice of the Russian fleet had not been in vain.\r\nThe sailors were learning all the duties of a garrison: the cannon from the\r\nships proved far more valuable on land. Three weeks of priceless time were\r\ngiven to leaders who knew how to turn every moment to account. When, on the\r\n17th of October, the bombardment which was to precede the assault on\r\nSebastopol began, the French artillery, operating on the south-west, was\r\noverpowered by that of the defenders. The fleets in vain thundered against\r\nthe solid sea-front of the fortress. At the end of eight days' cannonade,\r\nduring which the besiegers' batteries poured such a storm of shot and shell\r\nupon Sebastopol as no fortress had yet withstood, the defences were still\r\nunbroken.\r\n\r\n[Battle of Balaclava, Oct. 25.]\r\n\r\nMenschikoff in the meantime had received the reinforcements which he\r\nexpected, and was now ready to fall upon the besiegers from the east. His\r\npoint of attack was the English port of Balaclava and the fortified road\r\nlying somewhat east of this, which formed the outer line held by the\r\nEnglish and their Turkish supports. The plain of Balaclava is divided by a\r\nlow ridge into a northern and a southern valley. Along this ridge runs the\r\ncauseway, which had been protected by redoubts committed to a weak Turkish\r\nguard. On the morning of the 25th the Russians appeared in the northern\r\nvalley. They occupied the heights rising from it on the north and east,\r\nattacked the causeway, captured three of the redoubts, and drove off the\r\nTurks, left to meet their onset alone. Lord Raglan, who watched these\r\noperations from the edge of the western plateau, ordered up infantry from a\r\ndistance, but the only English troops on the spot were a light and a heavy\r\nbrigade of cavalry, each numbering about six hundred men. The Heavy\r\nBrigade, under General Scarlett, was directed to move towards Balaclava\r\nitself, which was now threatened. While they were on the march, a dense\r\ncolumn of Russian cavalry, about three thousand strong, appeared above the\r\ncrest of the low ridge, ready, as it seemed, to overwhelm the weak troops\r\nbefore them. But in their descent from the ridge the Russians halted, and\r\nScarlett with admirable courage and judgment formed his men for attack, and\r\ncharged full into the enemy with the handful who were nearest to him. They\r\ncut their way into the very heart of the column; and before the Russians\r\ncould crush them with mere weight the other regiments of the same brigade\r\nhurled themselves on the right and on the left against the huge inert mass.\r\nThe Russians broke and retreated in disorder before a quarter of their\r\nnumber, leaving to Scarlett and his men the glory of an action which\r\nranks with the Prussian attack at Mars-la-Tour in 1870 as the most\r\nbrilliant cavalry operation in modern warfare. The squadrons of the Light\r\nBrigade, during the peril and the victory of their comrades, stood\r\nmotionless, paralysed by the same defect of temper or intelligence in\r\ncommand which was soon to devote them to a fruitless but ever-memorable\r\nact of self-sacrifice. Russian infantry were carrying off the cannon from\r\nthe conquered redoubts on the causeway, when an aide-de-camp from the\r\ngeneral-in-chief brought to the Earl of Lucan, commander of the cavalry,\r\nan order to advance rapidly to the front, and save these guns. Lucan, who\r\nfrom his position could see neither the enemy nor the guns, believed\r\nhimself ordered to attack the Russian artillery at the extremity of the\r\nnorthern valley, and he directed the Light Brigade to charge in this\r\ndirection. It was in vain that the leader of the Light Brigade, Lord\r\nCardigan, warned his chief, in words which were indeed but too weak, that\r\nthere was a battery in front, a battery on each flank, and that the\r\nground was covered with Russian riflemen. The order was repeated as that\r\nof the head of the army, and it was obeyed. Thus\r\n\r\n  \"Into the valley of Death\r\n   Rode the Six Hundred.\"\r\n\r\nHow they died there, the remnant not turning till they had hewn their way\r\npast the guns and routed the enemy's cavalry behind them, the English\r\npeople will never forget. [473]\r\n\r\n[Battle of Inkermann, Nov. 5.]\r\n\r\nThe day of Balaclava brought to each side something of victory and\r\nsomething of failure. The Russians remained masters of the road that they\r\nhad captured, and carried off seven English guns; the English, where they\r\nhad met the enemy, proved that they could defeat overwhelming numbers. Not\r\nmany days passed before our infantry were put to the test which the cavalry\r\nhad so victoriously undergone. The siege-approaches of the French had been\r\nrapidly advanced, and it was determined that on the 5th of November the\r\nlong-deferred assault on Sebastopol should be made. On that very morning,\r\nunder cover of a thick mist, the English right was assailed by massive\r\ncolumns of the enemy. Menschikoff's army had now risen to a hundred\r\nthousand men; he had thrown troops into Sebastopol, and had planned the\r\ncapture of the English positions by a combined attack from Sebastopol\r\nitself, and by troops advancing from the lower valley of the Tchernaya\r\nacross the bridge of Inkermann. The battle of the 5th of November, on the\r\npart of the English, was a soldier's battle, without generalship, without\r\norder, without design. The men, standing to their ground whatever their own\r\nnumber and whatever that of the foe, fought, after their ammunition was\r\nexhausted, with bayonets, with the butt ends of their muskets, with their\r\nfists and with stones. For hours the ever-surging Russian mass rolled in\r\nupon them; but they maintained the unequal struggle until the arrival of\r\nFrench regiments saved them from their deadly peril and the enemy were\r\ndriven in confusion from the field. The Russian columns, marching right up\r\nto the guns, had been torn in pieces by artillery-fire. Their loss in\r\nkilled and wounded was enormous, their defeat one which no ingenuity could\r\ndisguise. Yet the battle of Inkermann had made the capture of Sebastopol,\r\nas it had been planned by the Allies, impossible. Their own loss was too\r\ngreat, the force which the enemy had displayed was too vast, to leave any\r\nhope that the fortress could be mastered by a sudden assault. The terrible\r\ntruth soon became plain that the enterprise on which the armies had been\r\nsent had in fact failed, and that another enterprise of a quite different\r\ncharacter, a winter siege in the presence of a superior enemy, a campaign\r\nfor which no preparations had been made, and for which all that was most\r\nnecessary was wanting, formed the only alternative to an evacuation of the\r\nCrimea.\r\n\r\n[Storm of Nov. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Winter in the Crimea.]\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of November the Euxine winter began with a storm which swept\r\naway the tents on the exposed plateau, and wrecked twenty-one vessels\r\nbearing stores of ammunition and clothing. From this time rain and snow\r\nturned the tract between the camp and Balaclava into a morass. The loss of\r\nthe paved road which had been captured by the Russians three weeks before\r\nnow told with fatal effect on the British army. The only communication with\r\nthe port of Balaclava was by a hillside track, which soon became impassable\r\nby carts. It was necessary to bring up supplies on the backs of horses; but\r\nthe horses perished from famine and from excessive labour. The men were too\r\nfew, too weak, too destitute of the helpful ways of English sailors, to\r\nassist in providing for themselves. Thus penned up on the bleak promontory,\r\ncholera-stricken, mocked rather than sustained during their benumbing toil\r\nwith rations of uncooked meat and green coffee-berries, the British\r\nsoldiery wasted away. Their effective force sank at mid-winter to eleven\r\nthousand men. In the hospitals, which even at Scutari were more deadly to\r\nthose who passed within them than the fiercest fire of the enemy, nine\r\nthousand men perished before the end of February. The time indeed came when\r\nthe very Spirit of Mercy seemed to enter these abodes of woe, and in the\r\npresence of Florence Nightingale nature at last regained its healing power,\r\npestilence no longer hung in the atmosphere which the sufferers breathed,\r\nand death itself grew mild. But before this new influence had vanquished\r\nroutine the grave had closed over whole regiments of men whom it had no\r\nright to claim. The sufferings of other armies have been on a greater\r\nscale, but seldom has any body of troops furnished a heavier tale of loss\r\nand death in proportion to its numbers than the British army during the\r\nwinter of the Crimean War. The unsparing exposure in the Press of the\r\nmismanagement under which our soldiers were perishing excited an outburst\r\nof indignation which overthrew Lord Aberdeen's Ministry and placed\r\nPalmerston in power. It also gave to Europe at large an impression that\r\nGreat Britain no longer knew how to conduct a war, and unduly raised the\r\nreputation of the French military administration, whose shortcomings, great\r\nas they were, no French journalist dared to describe. In spite of Alma and\r\nInkermann, the military prestige of England was injured, not raised, by the\r\nCrimean campaign; nor was it until the suppression of the Indian Mutiny\r\nthat the true capacity of the nation in war was again vindicated before the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n[Death of Nicholas, March 2, 1855.]\r\n\r\n[Conference of Vienna, March-May, 1855.]\r\n\r\n[Austria.]\r\n\r\n\"I have two generals who will not fail me,\" the Czar is reported to have\r\nsaid when he heard of Menschikoff's last defeat, \"Generals January and\r\nFebruary.\" General February fulfilled his task, but he smote the Czar too.\r\nIn the first days of March a new monarch inherited the Russian crown. [474]\r\nAlexander II. ascended the throne, announcing that he would adhere to the\r\npolicy of Peter the Great, of Catherine, and of Nicholas. But the proud\r\ntone was meant rather for the ear of Russia than of Europe, since Nicholas\r\nhad already expressed his willingness to treat for peace on the basis laid\r\ndown by the Western Powers in August, 1854. This change was not produced\r\nwholly by the battles of Alma and Inkermann. Prussia, finding itself\r\nisolated in Germany, had after some months of hesitation given a diplomatic\r\nsanction to the Four Points approved by Austria as indispensable conditions\r\nof peace. Russia thus stood forsaken, as it seemed, by its only friend, and\r\nNicholas could no longer hope to escape with the mere abandonment of those\r\nclaims which had been the occasion of the war. He consented to treat with\r\nhis enemies on their own terms. Austria now approached still more closely\r\nto the Western Powers, and bound itself by treaty, in the event of peace\r\nnot being concluded by the end of the year on the stated basis, to\r\ndeliberate with France and England upon effectual means for obtaining the\r\nobject of the Alliance. [475] Preparations were made for a Conference at\r\nVienna, from which Prussia, still declining to pledge itself to warlike\r\naction in case of the failure of the negotiations, was excluded. The\r\nsittings of the Conference began a few days after the accession of\r\nAlexander II. Russia was represented by its ambassador, Prince Alexander\r\nGortschakoff, who, as Minister of later years, was to play so conspicuous a\r\npart in undoing the work of the Crimean epoch. On the first two Articles\r\nforming the subject of negotiation, namely the abolition of the Russian\r\nProtectorate over Servia and the Principalities, and the removal of all\r\nimpediments to the free navigation of the Danube, agreement was reached.\r\nOn the third Article, the revision of the Treaty of July, 1841, relating\r\nto the Black Sea and the Dardanelles, the Russian envoy and the\r\nrepresentatives of the Western Powers found themselves completely at\r\nvariance. Gortschakoff had admitted that the Treaty of 1841 must be so\r\nrevised as to put an end to the preponderance of Russia in the Black Sea;\r\n[476] but while the Western Governments insisted upon the exclusion of\r\nRussian war-vessels from these waters, Gortschakoff would consent only to\r\nthe abolition of Russia's preponderance by the free admission of the\r\nwar-vessels of all nations, or by some similar method of counterpoise.\r\nThe negotiations accordingly came to an end, but not before Austria,\r\ndisputing the contention of the Allies that the object of the third\r\nArticle could be attained only by the specific means proposed by them,\r\nhad brought forward a third scheme based partly upon the limitation of\r\nthe Russian navy in the Euxine, partly upon the admission of war-ships of\r\nother nations. This scheme was rejected by the Western Powers, whereupon\r\nAustria declared that its obligations under the Treaty of December 2nd,\r\n1854, had now been fulfilled, and that it returned in consequence to the\r\nposition of a neutral.\r\n\r\nGreat indignation was felt and was expressed at London and Paris at this\r\nso-called act of desertion, and at the subsequent withdrawal of Austrian\r\nregiments from the positions which they had occupied in anticipation of\r\nwar. It was alleged that in the first two conditions of peace Austria had\r\nseen its own special interests effectually secured; and that as soon as the\r\nCourt of St. Petersburg had given the necessary assurances on these heads\r\nthe Cabinet of Vienna was willing to sacrifice the other objects of the\r\nAlliance and to abandon the cause of the Maritime Powers, in order to\r\nregain, with whatever loss of honour, the friendship of the Czar. Though it\r\nwas answered with perfect truth that Austria had never accepted the\r\nprinciple of the exclusion of Russia from the Black Sea, and was still\r\nready to take up arms in defence of that system by which it considered that\r\nRussia's preponderance in the Black Sea might be most suitably prevented,\r\nthis argument sounded hollow to combatants convinced of the futility of all\r\nmethods for holding Russia in check except their own. Austria had\r\ngrievously injured its own position and credit with the Western Powers. On\r\nthe other hand it had wounded Russia too deeply to win from the Czar the\r\nforgiveness which it expected. Its policy of balance, whether best\r\ndescribed as too subtle or as too impartial, had miscarried. It had\r\nforfeited its old, without acquiring new friendships. It remained isolated\r\nin Europe, and destined to meet without support and without an ally the\r\nblows which were soon to fall upon it.\r\n\r\n[Progress of the siege, January-May, 1855.]\r\n\r\n[Canrobert succeeded by Pélissier, May.]\r\n\r\n[Unsuccessful assault, June 18.]\r\n\r\n[Battle of the Tchernaya, Aug. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Capture of the Malakoff, Sept. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Fall of Sebastopol, Sept. 9.]\r\n\r\nThe prospects of the besieging armies before Sebastopol were in some\r\nrespects better towards the close of January, 1855, than they were when the\r\nConference of Vienna commenced its sittings six weeks later. Sardinia,\r\nunder the guidance of Cavour, had joined the Western Alliance, and was\r\nabout to send fifteen thousand soldiers to the Crimea. A new plan of\r\noperations, which promised excellent results, had been adopted at\r\nheadquarters. Up to the end of 1854 the French had directed their main\r\nattack against the Flagstaff bastion, a little to the west of the head of\r\nthe Man-of-War Harbour. They were now, however, convinced by Lord Raglan\r\nthat the true keystone to the defences of Sebastopol was the Malakoff, on\r\nthe eastern side, and they undertook the reduction of this formidable work,\r\nwhile the British directed their efforts against the neighbouring Redan.\r\n[477] The heaviest fire of the besiegers being thus concentrated on a\r\nnarrow line, it seemed as if Sebastopol must soon fall. But at the\r\nbeginning of February a sinister change came over the French camp. General\r\nNiel arrived from Paris vested with powers which really placed him in\r\ncontrol of the general-in-chief; and though Canrobert was but partially\r\nmade acquainted with the Emperor's designs, he was forced to sacrifice to\r\nthem much of his own honour and that of the army. Napoleon had determined\r\nto come to the Crimea himself, and at the fitting moment to end by one\r\ngrand stroke the war which had dragged so heavily in the hands of others.\r\nHe believed that Sebastopol could only be taken by a complete investment;\r\nand it was his design to land with a fresh army on the south-eastern coast\r\nof the Crimea, to march across the interior of the peninsula, to sweep\r\nMenschikoff's forces from their position above the Tchernaya, and to\r\ncomplete the investment of Sebastopol from the north. With this scheme of\r\noperations in view, all labour expended in the attack on Sebastopol from\r\nthe south was effort thrown away. Canrobert, who had promised his most\r\nvigorous co-operation to Lord Raglan, was fettered and paralysed by the\r\nEmperor's emissary at headquarters. For three successive months the\r\nRussians not only held their own, but by means of counter-approaches won\r\nback from the French some of the ground that they had taken. The very\r\nexistence of the Alliance was threatened when, after Canrobert and Lord\r\nRaglan had despatched a force to seize the Russian posts on the Sea of\r\nAzof, the French portion of this force was peremptorily recalled by the\r\nEmperor, in order that it might be employed in the march northwards across\r\nthe Crimea. At length, unable to endure the miseries of the position,\r\nCanrobert asked to be relieved of his command. He was succeeded by General\r\nPélissier. Pélissier, a resolute, energetic soldier, one moreover who did\r\nnot owe his promotion to complicity in the _coup d'état_, flatly\r\nrefused to obey the Emperor's orders. Sweeping aside the flimsy schemes\r\nevolved at the Tuileries, he returned with all his heart to the plan agreed\r\nupon by the Allied commanders at the beginning of the year; and from this\r\ntime, though disasters were still in store, they were not the result of\r\nfaltering or disloyalty at the headquarters of the French army. The general\r\nassault on the Malakoff and the Redan was fixed for the 18th of June. It\r\nwas bravely met by the Russians; the Allies were driven back with heavy\r\nloss, and three months more were added to the duration of the siege. Lord\r\nRaglan did not live to witness the last stage of the war. Exhausted by his\r\nlabours, heartsick at the failure of the great attack, he died on the 28th\r\nof June, leaving the command to General Simpson, an officer far his\r\ninferior. As the lines of the besiegers approached nearer and nearer to the\r\nRussian fortifications, the army which had been defeated at Inkermann\r\nadvanced for one last effort. Crossing the Tchernaya, it gave battle on the\r\n16th of August. The French and the Sardinians, with little assistance from\r\nthe British army, won a decisive victory. Sebastopol could hope no longer\r\nfor assistance from without, and on the 8th of September the blow which had\r\nfailed in June was dealt once more. The French, throwing themselves in\r\ngreat strength upon the Malakoff, carried this fortress by storm, and\r\nfrustrated every effort made for its recovery; the British, attacking the\r\nRedan with a miserably weak force, were beaten and overpowered. But the\r\nfall of the Malakoff was in itself equivalent to the capture of Sebastopol.\r\nA few more hours passed, and a series of tremendous explosions made known\r\nto the Allies that the Russian commander was blowing up his magazines and\r\nwithdrawing to the north of the Great Harbour. The prize was at length won,\r\nand at the end of a siege of three hundred and fifty days what remained of\r\nthe Czar's great fortress passed into the hands of his enemies.\r\n\r\n[Exhaustion of Russia.]\r\n\r\n[Fall of Kars, Nov. 28.]\r\n\r\n[Negotiations for peace.]\r\n\r\nThe Allies had lost since their landing in the Crimea not less than a\r\nhundred thousand men. An enterprise undertaken in the belief that it would\r\nbe accomplished in the course of a few weeks, and with no greater sacrifice\r\nof life than attends every attack upon a fortified place, had proved\r\narduous and terrible almost beyond example. Yet if the Crimean campaign was\r\nthe result of error and blindness on the part of the invaders, it was\r\nperhaps even more disastrous to Russia than any warfare in which an enemy\r\nwould have been likely to engage with fuller knowledge of the conditions to\r\nbe met. The vast distances that separated Sebastopol from the military\r\ndepôts in the interior of Russia made its defence a drain of the most\r\nfearful character on the levies and the resources of the country. What tens\r\nof thousands sank in the endless, unsheltered march without ever nearing\r\nthe sea, what provinces were swept of their beasts of burden, when every\r\nlarger shell fired against the enemy had to be borne hundreds of miles by\r\noxen, the records of the war but vaguely make known. The total loss of the\r\nRussians should perhaps be reckoned at three times that of the Allies. Yet\r\nthe fall of Sebastopol was not immediately followed by peace. The\r\nhesitation of the Allies in cutting off the retreat of the Russian army had\r\nenabled its commander to retain his hold upon the Crimea; in Asia, the\r\ndelays of a Turkish relieving army gave to the Czar one last gleam of\r\nsuccess in the capture of Kars, which, after a strenuous resistance,\r\nsuccumbed to famine on the 28th of November. But before Kars had fallen\r\nnegotiations for peace had commenced. France was weary of the war.\r\nNapoleon, himself unwilling to continue it except at the price of French\r\naggrandisement on the Continent, was surrounded by a band of palace\r\nstock-jobbers who had staked everything on the rise of the funds that would\r\nresult from peace. It was known at every Court of Europe that the Allies\r\nwere completely at variance with one another; that while the English\r\nnation, stung by the failure of its military administration during the\r\nwinter, by the nullity of its naval operations in the Baltic, and by the\r\nfinal disaster at the Redan, was eager to prove its real power in a new\r\ncampaign, the ruler of France, satisfied with the crowning glory of the\r\nMalakoff, was anxious to conclude peace on any tolerable terms. Secret\r\ncommunications from St. Petersburg were made at Paris by Baron Seebach,\r\nenvoy of Saxony, a son-in-law of the Russian Chancellor: the Austrian\r\nCabinet, still bent on acting the part of arbiter, but hopeless of the\r\nresults of a new Conference, addressed itself to the Emperor Napoleon\r\nsingly, and persuaded him to enter into a negotiation which was concealed\r\nfor a while from Great Britain. The two intrigues were simultaneously\r\npursued by our ally, but Seebach's proposals were such that even the\r\nwarmest friends of Russia at the Tuileries could scarcely support them, and\r\nthe Viennese diplomatists won the day. It was agreed that a note containing\r\nPreliminaries of Peace should be presented by Austria at St. Petersburg as\r\nits own ultimatum, after the Emperor Napoleon should have won from the\r\nBritish Government its assent to these terms without any alteration. The\r\nAustrian project embodied indeed the Four Points which Britain had in\r\nprevious months fixed as the conditions of peace, and in substance it\r\ndiffered little from what, even after the fall of Sebastopol, British\r\nstatesmen were still prepared to accept; but it was impossible that a\r\nscheme completed without the participation of Britain and laid down for its\r\npassive acceptance should be thus uncomplainingly adopted by its\r\nGovernment. Lord Palmerston required that the Four Articles enumerated\r\nshould be understood to cover points not immediately apparent on their\r\nsurface, and that a fifth Article should be added reserving to the Powers\r\nthe right of demanding certain further special conditions, it being\r\nunderstood that Great Britain would require under this clause only that\r\nRussia should bind itself to leave the Åland Islands in the Baltic Sea\r\nunfortified. Modified in accordance with the demand of the British\r\nGovernment, the Austrian draft was presented to the Czar at the end of\r\nDecember, with the notification that if it as not accepted by the 16th of\r\nJanuary the Austrian ambassador would quit St. Petersburg. On the 15th a\r\nCouncil was held in the presence of the Czar. Nesselrode, who first gave\r\nhis opinion, urged that the continuance of the war would plunge Russia into\r\nhostilities with all Europe, and advised submission to a compact which\r\nwould last only until Russia had recovered its strength or new relations\r\nhad arisen among the Powers. One Minister after another declared that\r\nPoland, Finland, the Crimea, and the Caucasus would be endangered if peace\r\nwere not now made; the Chief of the Finances stated that Russia could not\r\ngo through another campaign without bankruptcy. [478] At the end of the\r\ndiscussion the Council declared unanimously in favour of accepting the\r\nAustrian propositions; and although the national feeling was still in\r\nfavour of resistance, there appears to have been one Russian statesman\r\nalone, Prince Gortschakoff, ambassador at Vienna, who sought to dissuade\r\nthe Czar from making peace. His advice was not taken. The vote of the\r\nCouncil was followed by the despatch of plenipotentiaries to Paris, and\r\nhere, on the 25th of February, 1856, the envoys of all the Powers, with the\r\nexception of Prussia, assembled in Conference, in order to frame the\r\ndefinitive Treaty of Peace. [479]\r\n\r\n[Conference of Paris, Feb. 25, 1856.]\r\n\r\n[Treaty of Paris, March 30, 1856.]\r\n\r\nIn the debates which now followed, and which occupied more than a month,\r\nLord Clarendon, who represented Great Britain, discovered that in each\r\ncontested point he had to fight against the Russian and the French envoys\r\ncombined, so completely was the Court of the Tuileries now identified with\r\na policy of conciliation and friendliness towards Russia. [480] Great\r\nfirmness, great plainness of speech was needed on the part of the British\r\nGovernment, in order to prevent the recognised objects of the war from\r\nbeing surrendered by its ally, not from a conviction that they were\r\nvisionary or unattainable, but from unsteadiness of purpose and from the\r\ndesire to convert a defeated enemy into a friend. The end, however, was at\r\nlength reached, and on the 30th of March the Treaty of Paris was signed.\r\nThe Black Sea was neutralised; its waters and ports, thrown open to the\r\nmercantile marine of every nation, were formally and in perpetuity\r\ninterdicted to the war-ships both of the Powers possessing its coasts and\r\nof all other Powers. The Czar and the Sultan undertook not to establish or\r\nmaintain upon its coasts any military or maritime arsenal. Russia ceded a\r\nportion of Bessarabia, accepting a frontier which excluded it from the\r\nDanube. The free navigation of this river, henceforth to be effectively\r\nmaintained by an international Commission, was declared part of the public\r\nlaw of Europe. The Powers declared the Sublime Porte admitted to\r\nparticipate in the advantages of the public law and concert of Europe, each\r\nengaging to respect the independence and integrity of the Ottoman Empire,\r\nand all guaranteeing in common the strict observance of this engagement,\r\nand promising to consider any act tending to its violation as a question of\r\ngeneral interest. The Sultan \"having, in his constant solicitude for the\r\nwelfare of his subjects, issued a firman recording his generous intentions\r\ntowards the Christian population of his empire, [481] and having\r\ncommunicated it to the Powers,\" the Powers \"recognised the high value of\r\nthis communication,\" declaring at the same time \"that it could not, in any\r\ncase, give to them the right to interfere, either collectively or\r\nseparately, in the relations of the Sultan to his subjects, or in the\r\ninternal administration of his empire.\" The Danubian Principalities,\r\naugmented by the strip of Bessarabia taken from Russia, were to continue to\r\nenjoy, under the suzerainty of the Porte and under the guarantee of the\r\nPowers, all the privileges and immunities of which they were in possession,\r\nno exclusive protection being exercised by any of the guaranteeing\r\nPowers. [482]\r\n\r\n[Agreement of the Conference on rights of neutrals.]\r\n\r\nPassing beyond the immediate subjects of negotiation, the Conference\r\navailed itself of its international character to gain the consent of Great\r\nBritain to a change in the laws of maritime war. England had always\r\nclaimed, and had always exercised, the right to seize an enemy's goods on\r\nthe high sea though conveyed in a neutral vessel, and to search the\r\nmerchant-ships of neutrals for this purpose. The exercise of this right had\r\nstirred up against England the Maritime League of 1800, and was condemned\r\nby nearly the whole civilised world. Nothing short of an absolute command\r\nof the seas made it safe or possible for a single Power to maintain a\r\npractice which threatened at moments of danger to turn the whole body of\r\nneutral States into its enemies. Moreover, if the seizure of belligerents'\r\ngoods in neutral ships profited England when it was itself at war, it\r\ninjured England at all times when it remained at peace during the struggles\r\nof other States. Similarly by the issue of privateers England inflicted\r\ngreat injury on its enemies; but its own commerce, exceeding that of every\r\nother State, offered to the privateers of its foes a still richer booty.\r\nThe advantages of the existing laws of maritime war were not altogether on\r\nthe side of England, though mistress of the seas; and in return for the\r\nabolition of privateering, the British Government consented to surrender\r\nits sharpest, but most dangerous, weapon of offence, and to permit the\r\nproducts of a hostile State to find a market in time of war. The rule was\r\nlaid down that the goods of an enemy other than contraband of war should\r\nhenceforth be safe under a neutral flag. Neutrals' goods discovered on an\r\nenemy's ship were similarly made exempt from capture.\r\n\r\n[Fictions of the Treaty of Paris as to Turkey.]\r\n\r\nThe enactments of the Conference of Paris relating to commerce in time of\r\nhostilities have not yet been subjected to the strain of a war between\r\nEngland and any European State; its conclusions on all other subjects were\r\nbut too soon put to the test, and have one after another been found\r\nwanting. If the Power which calls man into his moment of life could smile\r\nat the efforts and the assumptions of its creature, such smile might have\r\nbeen moved by the assembly of statesmen who, at the close of the Crimean\r\nWar, affected to shape the future of Eastern Europe. They persuaded\r\nthemselves that by dint of the iteration of certain phrases they could\r\nconvert the Sultan and his hungry troop of Pashas into the chiefs of a\r\nEuropean State. They imagined that the House of Osman, which in the stages\r\nof a continuous decline had successively lost its sway over Hungary, over\r\nServia, over Southern Greece and the Danubian Provinces, and which would\r\ntwice within the last twenty-five years have seen its Empire dashed to\r\npieces by an Egyptian vassal but for the intervention of Europe, might be\r\narrested in its decadence by an incantation, and be made strong enough and\r\nenlightened enough to govern to all time the Slavic and Greek populations\r\nwhich had still the misfortune to be included within its dominions.\r\nRecognising--so ran the words which read like bitter irony, but which were\r\nmeant for nothing of the kind--the value of the Sultan's promises of\r\nreform, the authors of the Treaty of Paris proceeded, as if of set purpose,\r\nto extinguish any vestige of responsibility which might have been felt at\r\nConstantinople, and any spark of confidence that might still linger among\r\nthe Christian populations, by declaring that, whether the Sultan observed\r\nor broke his promises, in no case could any right of intervention by Europe\r\narise. The helmsman was given his course; the hatches were battened down.\r\nIf words bore any meaning, if the Treaty of Paris was not an elaborate\r\npiece of imposture, the Christian subjects of the Sultan had for the\r\nfuture, whatever might be their wrongs, no redress to look for but in the\r\nexertion of their own power. The terms of the Treaty were in fact such as\r\nmight have been imposed if the Western Powers had gone to war with Russia\r\nfor some object of their own, and had been rescued, when defeated and\r\noverthrown, by the victorious interposition of the Porte. All was hollow,\r\nall based on fiction and convention. The illusions of nations in time of\r\nrevolutionary excitement, the shallow, sentimental commonplaces of liberty\r\nand fraternity have afforded just matter for satire; but no democratic\r\nplatitudes were ever more palpably devoid of connection with fact, more\r\nflagrantly in contradiction to the experience of the past, or more\r\nignominiously to be refuted by each succeeding act of history, than the\r\ndeliberate consecration of the idol of an Ottoman Empire as the crowning\r\nact of European wisdom in 1856.\r\n\r\n[The Danubian Principalities.]\r\n\r\n[Alexander Cuza Hospodar of both Provinces.]\r\n\r\n[Complete Union, 1862.]\r\n\r\n[Charles of Hohenzollern, Hereditary Prince, 1866.]\r\n\r\nAmong the devotees of the Turk the English Ministers were the most\r\nimpassioned, having indeed in the possession of India some excuse for their\r\nfervour on behalf of any imaginable obstacle that would keep the Russians\r\nout of Constantinople. The Emperor of the French had during the Conferences\r\nat Paris revived his project of incorporating the Danubian Principalities\r\nwith Austria in return for the cession of Lombardy, but the Viennese\r\nGovernment had declined to enter into any such arrangement. Napoleon\r\nconsequently entered upon a new Eastern policy. Appreciating the growing\r\nforce of nationality in European affairs, and imagining that in the\r\nchampionship of the principle of nationality against the Treaties of 1815\r\nhe would sooner or later find means for the aggrandisement of himself and\r\nFrance, he proposed that the Provinces of Moldavia and Wallachia, while\r\nremaining in dependence upon the Sultan, should be united into a single\r\nState under a prince chosen by themselves. The English Ministry would not\r\nhear of this union. In their view the creation of a Roumanian Principality\r\nunder a chief not appointed by the Porte was simply the abstraction from\r\nthe Sultan of six million persons who at present acknowledged his\r\nsuzerainty, and whose tribute to Constantinople ought, according to Lord\r\nClarendon, to be increased. [483] Austria, fearing the effect of a\r\nRoumanian national movement upon its own Roumanian subjects in\r\nTransylvania, joined in resistance to Napoleon's scheme, and the political\r\norganisation of the Principalities was in consequence reserved by the\r\nConference of Paris for future settlement. Elections were held in the\r\nspring of 1857 under a decree from the Porte, with the result that\r\nMoldavia, as it seemed, pronounced against union with the sister province.\r\nBut the complaint at once arose that the Porte had falsified the popular\r\nvote. France and Russia had now established relations of such amity that\r\ntheir ambassadors jointly threatened to quit Constantinople if the\r\nelections were not annulled. A visit paid by the French Emperor to Queen\r\nVictoria, with the object of smoothing over the difficulties which had\r\nbegun to threaten the Western alliance, resulted rather in increased\r\nmisunderstandings between the two Governments as to the future of the\r\nPrincipalities than in any real agreement. The elections were annulled. New\r\nrepresentative bodies met at Bucharest and Jassy, and pronounced almost\r\nunanimously for union (October, 1857). In the spring of 1858 the Conference\r\nof Paris reassembled in order to frame a final settlement of the affairs of\r\nthe Principalities. It determined that in each Province there should be a\r\nHospodar elected for life, a separate judicature, and a separate\r\nlegislative Assembly, while a central Commission, formed by representatives\r\nof both Provinces, should lay before the Assemblies projects of law on\r\nmatters of joint interest. In accordance with these provisions, Assemblies\r\nwere elected in each Principality at the beginning of 1859. Their first\r\nduty was to choose the two Hospodars, but in both Provinces a unanimous\r\nvote fell upon the same person, Prince Alexander Cuza. The efforts of\r\nEngland and Austria to prevent union were thus baffled by the Roumanian\r\npeople itself, and after three years the elaborate arrangements made by the\r\nConference were similarly swept away, and a single Ministry and Assembly\r\ntook the place of the dual Government. It now remained only to substitute a\r\nhereditary Prince for a Hospodar elected for life; and in 1866, on the\r\nexpulsion of Alexander Cuza by his subjects, Prince Charles of\r\nHohenzollern-Sigmaringen, a distant kinsman of the reigning Prussian\r\nsovereign, was recognised by all Europe as Hereditary Prince of Roumania.\r\nThe suzerainty of the Porte, now reduced to the bare right to receive a\r\nfixed tribute, was fated to last but for a few years longer.\r\n\r\n[Continued discord in Turkish Empire.]\r\n\r\n[Revision of the Treaty of Paris, 1871.]\r\n\r\nEurope had not to wait for the establishment of Roumanian independence in\r\norder to judge of the foresight and the statesmanship of the authors of the\r\nTreaty of Paris. Scarcely a year passed without the occurrence of some\r\nevent that cast ridicule upon the fiction of a self-regenerated Turkey, and\r\nupon the profession of the Powers that the epoch of external interference\r\nin its affairs was at an end. The active misgovernment of the Turkish\r\nauthorities themselves, their powerlessness or want of will to prevent\r\nflagrant outrage and wrong among those whom they professed to rule,\r\ncontinued after the Treaty of Paris to be exactly what they had been before\r\nit. In 1860 massacres and civil war in Mount Lebanon led to the occupation\r\nof Syria by French troops. In 1861 Bosnia and Herzegovina took up arms. In\r\n1863 Servia expelled its Turkish garrisons. Crete, rising in the following\r\nyear, fought long for its independence, and seemed for a moment likely to\r\nbe united with Greece under the auspices of the Powers, but it was finally\r\nabandoned to its Ottoman masters. At the end of fourteen years from the\r\nsignature of the Peace of Paris, the downfall of the French Empire enabled\r\nRussia to declare that it would no longer recognise the provisions of the\r\nTreaty which excluded its war-ships and its arsenals from the Black Sea. It\r\nwas for this, and for this almost alone, that England had gone through the\r\nCrimean War. But for the determination of Lord Palmerston to exclude Russia\r\nfrom the Black Sea, peace might have been made while the Allied armies were\r\nstill at Varna. This exclusion was alleged to be necessary in the interests\r\nof Europe at large; that it was really enforced not in the interest of\r\nEurope but in the interest of England was made sufficiently clear by the\r\naction of Austria and Prussia, whose statesmen, in spite of the discourses\r\nso freely addressed to them from London, were at least as much alive to the\r\ninterests of their respective countries as Lord Palmerston could be on\r\ntheir behalf. Nor had France in 1854 any interest in crippling the power of\r\nRussia, or in Eastern affairs generally, which could be remotely compared\r\nwith those of the possessors of India. The personal needs of Napoleon III.\r\nmade him, while he seemed to lead, the instrument of the British Government\r\nfor enforcing British aims, and so gave to Palmerston the momentary shaping\r\nof a new and superficial concert of the Powers. Masters of Sebastopol, the\r\nAllies had experienced little difficulty in investing their own conclusions\r\nwith the seeming authority of Europe at large; but to bring the\r\nrepresentatives of Austria and Prussia to a Council-table, to hand them the\r\npen to sign a Treaty dictated by France and England, was not to bind them\r\nto a policy which was not their own, or to make those things interests of\r\nAustria and Prussia which were not their interests before. Thus when in\r\n1870 the French Empire fell, England stood alone as the Power concerned in\r\nmaintaining the exclusion of Russia from the Euxine, and this exclusion it\r\ncould enforce no longer. It was well that Palmerston had made the Treaty of\r\nParis the act of Europe, but not for the reasons which Palmerston had\r\nimagined. The fiction had engendered no new relation in fact; it did not\r\nprolong for one hour the submission of Russia after it had ceased to be\r\nconfronted in the West by a superior force; but it enabled Great Britain to\r\nretire without official humiliation from a position which it had conquered\r\nonly through the help of an accidental Alliance, and which it was unable to\r\nmaintain alone. The ghost of the Conference of 1856 was, as it were,\r\nconjured up in the changed world of 1871. The same forms which had once\r\nstamped with the seal of Europe the instrument of restraint upon Russia now\r\nas decorously executed its release. Britain accepted what Europe would not\r\nresist; and below the slopes where lay the countless dead of three nations\r\nSebastopol rose from its ruins, and the ensign of Russia floated once more\r\nover its ships of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nPiedmont after 1849--Ministry of Azeglio--Cavour Prime Minister--Designs of\r\nCavour--His Crimean Policy--Cavour at the Conference of Paris--Cavour and\r\nNapoleon III.--The Meeting at Plombières--Preparations in Italy--Treaty of\r\nJanuary, 1859--Attempts at Mediation--Austrian Ultimatum--Campaign of\r\n1859--Magenta--Movement in Central Italy--Solferino--Napoleon and Prussia\r\n--Interview of Villafranca--Cavour resigns--Peace of Zürich--Central Italy\r\nafter Villafranca--The Proposed Congress--\"The Pope and the Congress\"--\r\nCavour resumes office--Cavour and Napoleon--Union of the Duchies and the\r\nRomagna with Piedmont--Savoy and Nice added to France--Cavour on this\r\ncession--European opinion--Naples--Sicily--Garibaldi lands at Marsala--\r\nCapture of Palermo--The Neapolitans evacuate Sicily--Cavour and the Party\r\nof Action--Cavour's Policy as to Naples--Garibaldi on the Mainland--Persano\r\nand Villamarina at Naples--Garibaldi at Naples--The Piedmontese Army enters\r\nUmbria and the Marches--Fall of Ancona--Garibaldi and Cavour--The Armies on\r\nthe Volturno--Fall of Gaeta--Cavour's Policy with regard to Rome and\r\nVenice--Death of Cavour--The Free Church in the Free State.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Piedmont after 1849.]\r\n\r\nIn the gloomy years that followed 1849 the kingdom of Sardinia had stood\r\nout in bright relief as a State which, though crushed on the battle-field,\r\nhad remained true to the cause of liberty while all around it the forces of\r\nreaction gained triumph after triumph. Its King had not the intellectual\r\ngifts of the maker of a great State, but he was one with whom those\r\npossessed of such gifts could work, and on whom they could depend. With\r\ncertain grave private faults Victor Emmanuel had the public virtues of\r\nintense patriotism, of loyalty to his engagements and to his Ministers, of\r\ndevotion to a single great aim. Little given to speculative thought, he saw\r\nwhat it most concerned him to see, that Piedmont by making itself the home\r\nof liberty could become the Master-State of Italy. His courage on the\r\nbattle-field, splendid and animating as it was, distinguished him less than\r\nanother kind of courage peculiarly his own. Ignorant and superstitious, he\r\nhad that rare and masculine quality of soul which in the anguish of\r\nbereavement and on the verge of the unseen world remains proof against the\r\nappeal and against the terrors of a voice speaking with more than human\r\nauthority. Rome, not less than Austria, stood across the path that led to\r\nItalian freedom, and employed all its art, all its spiritual force, to turn\r\nVictor Emmanuel from the work that lay before him. There were moments in\r\nhis life when a man of not more than common weakness might well have\r\nflinched from the line of conduct on which he had resolved in hours of\r\nstrength and of insight; there were times when a less constant mind might\r\nwell have wavered and cast a balance between opposing systems of policy. It\r\nwas not through heroic greatness that Victor Emmanuel rendered his\r\npriceless services to Italy. He was a man not conspicuously cast in a\r\ndifferent mould from many another plain, strong nature, but the qualities\r\nwhich he possessed were precisely those which Italy required. Fortune,\r\ncircumstance, position favoured him and made his glorious work possible;\r\nbut what other Italian prince of this century, though placed on the throne\r\nof Piedmont, and numbering Cavour among his subjects, would have played the\r\npart, the simple yet all momentous part, which Victor Emmanuel played so\r\nwell? The love and the gratitude of Italy have been lavished without stint\r\non the memory of its first sovereign, who served his nation with qualities\r\nof so homely a type, and in whose life there was so much that needed\r\npardon. The colder judgment of a later time will hardly contest the title\r\nof Victor Emmanuel to be ranked among those few men without whom Italian\r\nunion would not have been achieved for another generation.\r\n\r\n[Ministry of Azeglio, 1849-52.]\r\n\r\n[Cavour Prime Minister, 1852.]\r\n\r\nOn the conclusion of peace with Austria after the campaign of Novara, the\r\nGovernment and the Parliament of Turin addressed themselves to the work of\r\nemancipating the State from the system of ecclesiastical privilege and\r\nclerical ascendency which had continued in full vigour down to the last\r\nyear of Charles Albert's reign. Since 1814 the Church had maintained, or\r\nhad recovered, both in Piedmont and in the island of Sardinia, rights which\r\nhad been long wrested from it in other European societies, and which were\r\nout of harmony with the Constitution now taking root under Victor Emmanuel.\r\nThe clergy had still their own tribunals, and even in the case of criminal\r\noffences were not subject to the jurisdiction of the State. The Bishops\r\npossessed excessive powers and too large a share of the Church revenues;\r\nthe parochial clergy lived in want; monasteries and convents abounded. It\r\nwas not in any spirit of hostility towards the Church that Massimo\r\nd'Azeglio, whom the King called to office after Novara, commenced the work\r\nof reform by measures subjecting the clergy to the law-courts of the State,\r\nabolishing the right of sanctuary in monasteries, and limiting the power of\r\ncorporations to acquire landed property. If the Papacy would have met\r\nVictor Emmanuel in a fair spirit his Government would gladly have avoided a\r\ndangerous and exasperating struggle; but all the forces and the passions of\r\nUltramontanism were brought to bear against the proposed reforms. The\r\nresult was that the Minister, abandoned by a section of the Conservative\r\nparty on whom he had relied, sought the alliance of men ready for a larger\r\nand bolder policy, and called to office the foremost of those from whom he\r\nhad received an independent support in the Chamber, Count Cavour. Entering\r\nthe Cabinet in 1850 as Minister of Commerce, Cavour rapidly became the\r\nmaster of all his colleagues. On his own responsibility he sought and won\r\nthe support of the more moderate section of the Opposition, headed by\r\nRattazzi; and after a brief withdrawal from office, caused by divisions\r\nwithin the Cabinet, he returned to power in October, 1852, as Prime\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n[Cavour.]\r\n\r\nCavour, though few men have gained greater fame as diplomatists, had not\r\nbeen trained in official life. The younger son of a noble family, he had\r\nentered the army in 1826, and served in the Engineers; but his sympathies\r\nwith the liberal movement of 1830 brought him into extreme disfavour with\r\nhis chiefs. He was described by Charles Albert, then Prince of Carignano,\r\nas the most dangerous man in the kingdom, and was transferred at the\r\ninstance of his own father to the solitary Alpine fortress of Bard. Too\r\nvigorous a nature to submit to inaction, too buoyant and too sagacious to\r\nresort to conspiracy, he quitted the army, and soon afterwards undertook\r\nthe management of one of the family estates, devoting himself to scientific\r\nagriculture on a large scale. He was a keen and successful man of business,\r\nbut throughout the next twelve years, which he passed in fruitful private\r\nindustry, his mind dwelt ardently on public affairs. He was filled with a\r\ndeep discontent at the state of society which he saw around him in\r\nPiedmont, and at the condition of Italy at large under foreign and clerical\r\nrule. Repeated visits to France and England made him familiar with the\r\ninstitutions of freer lands, and gave definiteness to his political and\r\nsocial aims. [484] In 1847, when changes were following fast, he founded\r\nwith some other Liberal nobles the journal _Risorgimento_, devoted to\r\nthe cause of national revival; and he was one of the first who called upon\r\nKing Charles Albert to grant a Constitution. During the stormy days of 1848\r\nhe was at once the vigorous advocate of war with Austria and the adversary\r\nof Republicans and Extremists who for their own theories seemed willing to\r\nplunge Italy into anarchy. Though unpopular with the mob, he was elected to\r\nthe Chamber by Turin, and continued to represent the capital after the\r\npeace. Up to this time there had been little opportunity for the proof of\r\nhis extraordinary powers, but the inborn sagacity of Victor Emmanuel had\r\nalready discerned in him a man who could not remain in a subordinate\r\nposition. \"You will see him turn you all out of your places,\" the King\r\nremarked to his Ministers, as he gave his assent to Cavour's first\r\nappointment to a seat in the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n[Plans of Cavour.]\r\n\r\n[Cavour's Crimean policy.]\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Azeglio had served Piedmont with honour from 1849 to 1852,\r\nbut its leader scarcely possessed the daring and fertility of mind which\r\nthe time required. Cavour threw into the work of government a passion and\r\nintelligence which soon produced results visible to all Europe. His\r\ndevotion to Italy was as deep, as all-absorbing, as that of Mazzini\r\nhimself, though the methods and schemes of the two men were in such\r\ncomplete antagonism. Cavour's fixed purpose was to drive Austria out of\r\nItaly by defeat in the battle-field, and to establish, as the first step\r\ntowards national union, a powerful kingdom of Northern Italy under Victor\r\nEmmanuel. In order that the military and naval forces of Piedmont might be\r\nraised to the highest possible strength and efficiency, he saw that the\r\nresources of the country must be largely developed; and with this object he\r\nnegotiated commercial treaties with Foreign Powers, laid down railways, and\r\nsuppressed the greater part of the monasteries, selling their lands to\r\ncultivators, and devoting the proceeds of sale not to State-purposes but to\r\nthe payment of the working clergy. Industry advanced; the heavy pressure of\r\ntaxation was patiently borne; the army and the fleet grew apace. But the\r\ncause of Piedmont was one with that of the Italian nation, and it became\r\nits Government to demonstrate this day by day with no faltering voice or\r\nhand. Protection and support were given to fugitives from Austrian and\r\nPapal tyranny; the Press was laid open to every tale of wrong; and when,\r\nafter an unsuccessful attempt at insurrection in Milan in 1853, for which\r\nMazzini and the Republican exiles were alone responsible, the Austrian\r\nGovernment sequestrated the property of its subjects who would not return\r\nfrom Piedmont, Cavour bade his ambassador quit Vienna, and appealed to\r\nevery Court in Europe. Nevertheless, Cavour did not believe that Italy,\r\neven by a simultaneous rising, could permanently expel the Austrian armies\r\nor conquer the Austrian fortresses. The experience of forty years pointed\r\nto the opposite conclusion; and while Mazzini in his exile still imagined\r\nthat a people needed only to determine to be free in order to be free,\r\nCavour schemed for an alliance which should range against the Austrian\r\nEmperor armed forces as numerous and as disciplined as his own. It was\r\nmainly with this object that Cavour plunged Sardinia into the Crimean War.\r\nHe was not without just causes of complaint against the Czar; but the\r\nmotive with which he sent the Sardinian troops to Sebastopol was not that\r\nthey might take vengeance on Russia, but that they might fight side by side\r\nwith the soldiers of England and France. That the war might lead to\r\ncomplications still unforeseen was no doubt a possibility present to\r\nCavour's mind, and in that case it was no small thing that Sardinia stood\r\nallied to the two Western Powers; but apart from these chances of the\r\nfuture, Sardinia would have done ill to stand idle when at any moment, as\r\nit seemed, Austria might pass from armed neutrality into active concert\r\nwith England and France. Had Austria so drawn the sword against Russia\r\nwhilst Piedmont stood inactive, the influence of the Western Powers must\r\nfor some years to come have been ranged on the side of Austria in the\r\nmaintenance of its Italian possessions, and Piedmont could at the best have\r\nlooked only to St. Petersburg for sympathy or support. Cavour was not\r\nscrupulous in his choice of means when the liberation of Italy was the end\r\nin view, and the charge was made against him that in joining the coalition\r\nagainst Russia he lightly entered into a war in which Piedmont had no\r\ndirect concern. But reason and history absolve, and far more than absolve,\r\nthe Italian statesman. If the cause of European equilibrium, for which\r\nEngland and France took up arms, was a legitimate ground of war in the case\r\nof these two Powers, it was not less so in the case of their ally; while if\r\nthe ulterior results rather than the motive of a war are held to constitute\r\nits justification, Cavour stands out as the one politician in Europe whose\r\naims in entering upon the Crimean War have been fulfilled, not mocked, by\r\nevents. He joined in the struggle against Russia not in order to maintain\r\nthe Ottoman Empire, but to gain an ally in liberating Italy. The Ottoman\r\nEmpire has not been maintained; the independence of Italy has been\r\nestablished, and established by means of the alliance which Cavour gained.\r\nHis Crimean policy is one of those excessively rare instances of\r\nstatesmanship where action has been determined not by the driving and\r\nhalf-understood necessities of the moment, but by a distinct and true\r\nperception of the future. He looked only in one direction, but in that\r\ndirection he saw clearly. Other statesmen struck blindfold, or in their\r\nvision of a regenerated Turkey fought for an empire of mirage. It may with\r\nsome reason be asked whether the order of Eastern Europe would now be\r\ndifferent if our own English soldiers who fell at Balaclava had been\r\nallowed to die in their beds: every Italian whom Cavour sent to perish on\r\nthe Tchernaya or in the cholera-stricken camp died as directly for the\r\ncause of Italian independence as if he had fallen on the slopes of Custozza\r\nor under the walls of Rome.\r\n\r\n[Cavour at the Conference of Paris.]\r\n\r\n[Change of Austrian policy, 1856.]\r\n\r\nAt the Conference of Paris in 1856 the Sardinian Premier took his place in\r\nright of alliance by the side of the representatives of the great Powers;\r\nand when the main business of the Conference was concluded, Count Buol, the\r\nAustrian Minister, was forced to listen to a vigorous denunciation by\r\nCavour of the misgovernment that reigned in Central and Southern Italy, of\r\nthe Austrian occupation which rendered this possible. Though the French\r\nwere still in Rome, their presence might by courtesy be described as a\r\nmeasure of precaution rendered necessary by the intrusion of the Austrians\r\nfarther north; and both the French and English plenipotentiaries at the\r\nConference supported Cavour in his invective. Cavour returned to Italy\r\nwithout any territorial reward for the services that Piedmont had rendered\r\nto the Allies; but his object was attained. He had exhibited Austria\r\nisolated and discredited before Europe; he had given to his country a voice\r\nthat it had never before had in the Councils of the Powers; he had produced\r\na deep conviction throughout Italy that Piedmont not only could and would\r\nact with vigour against the national enemy, but that in its action it would\r\nhave the help of allies. From this time the Republican and Mazzinian\r\nsocieties lost ground before the growing confidence in the House of Savoy,\r\nin its Minister and its army. [485] The strongest evidence of the effect of\r\nCavour's Crimean policy and of his presence at the Conference of Paris was\r\nseen in the action of the Austrian Government itself. From 1849 to 1856 its\r\nrule in Northern Italy had been one not so much of severity as of brutal\r\nviolence. Now all was changed. The Emperor came to Milan to proclaim a\r\ngeneral amnesty and to win the affection of his subjects. The sequestrated\r\nestates were restored to their owners. Radetzky, in his ninety-second year,\r\nwas at length allowed to pass into retirement; the government of the sword\r\nwas declared at an end; Maximilian, the gentlest and most winning of the\r\nHapsburgs, was sent with his young bride to charm away the sad memories of\r\nthe evil time. But it was too late. The recognition shown by the Lombards\r\nof the Emperor's own personal friendliness indicated no reconciliation with\r\nAustria; and while Francis Joseph was still in Milan, King Victor Emmanuel,\r\nin the presence of a Lombard deputation, laid the first stone of the\r\nmonument erected by subscriptions from all Italy in memory of those who had\r\nfallen in the campaigns of 1848 and 1849, the statue of a foot-soldier\r\nwaving his sword towards the Austrian frontier. The Sardinian Press\r\nredoubled its attacks on Austria and its Italian vassals. The Government of\r\nVienna sought satisfaction; Cavour sharply refused it; and diplomatic\r\nrelations between the two Courts, which had been resumed since the\r\nConference of Paris, were again broken off.\r\n\r\n[Cavour and Napoleon III.]\r\n\r\n[Meeting at Plombières, July, 1858.]\r\n\r\nOf the two Western Powers, Cavour would have preferred an alliance with\r\nGreat Britain, which had no objects of its own to seek in Italy; but when\r\nhe found that the Government of London would not assist him by arms against\r\nAustria, he drew closer to the Emperor Napoleon, and supported him\r\nthroughout his controversy with England and Austria on the settlement of\r\nthe Danubian Principalities. Napoleon, there is no doubt, felt a real\r\ninterest in Italy. His own early political theories formed on a study of\r\nthe Napoleonic Empire, his youthful alliance with the Carbonari, point to a\r\nsympathy with the Italian national cause which was genuine if not profound,\r\nand which was not altogether lost in 1849, though France then acted as the\r\nenemy of Roman independence. If Napoleon intended to remould the\r\nContinental order and the Treaties of 1815 in the interests of France and\r\nof the principle of nationality, he could make no better beginning than by\r\ndriving Austria from Northern Italy. It was not even necessary for him to\r\ndevise an original policy. Early in 1848, when it seemed probable that\r\nPiedmont would be increased by Lombardy and part of Venetia, Lamartine had\r\nlaid it down that France ought in that case to be compensated by Savoy, in\r\norder to secure its frontiers against so powerful a neighbour as the new\r\nItalian State. To this idea Napoleon returned. Savoy had been incorporated\r\nwith France from 1792 to 1814; its people were more French than Italian;\r\nits annexation would not directly injure the interests of any great Power.\r\nOf the three directions in which France might stretch towards its old\r\nlimits of the Alps and the Rhine, the direction of Savoy was by far the\r\nleast dangerous. Belgium could not be touched without certain loss of the\r\nEnglish alliance, with which Napoleon could not yet dispense; an attack\r\nupon the Rhenish Provinces would probably be met by all the German Powers\r\ntogether; in Savoy alone was there the chance of gaining territory without\r\nraising a European coalition against France. No sooner had the organisation\r\nof the Danubian Principalities been completed by the Conference which met\r\nin the spring of 1858 than Napoleon began to develop his Italian plans. An\r\nattempt of a very terrible character which was made upon his life by\r\nOrsini, a Roman exile, though at the moment it threatened to embroil\r\nSardinia with France, probably stimulated him to action. In the summer of\r\n1858 he invited Cavour to meet him at Plombières. The negotiations which\r\nthere passed were not made known by the Emperor to his Ministers; they were\r\ncommunicated by Cavour to two persons only besides Victor Emmanuel. It\r\nseems that no written engagement was drawn up; it was verbally agreed that\r\nif Piedmont could, without making a revolutionary war, and without exposing\r\nNapoleon to the charge of aggression, incite Austria to hostilities, France\r\nwould act as its ally. Austria was then to be expelled from Venetia as well\r\nas from Lombardy. Victor Emmanuel was to become sovereign of North-Italy,\r\nwith the Roman Legations and Marches; the remainder of the Papal territory,\r\nexcept Rome itself and the adjacent district, was to be added to Tuscany,\r\nso constituting a new kingdom of Central Italy. The two kingdoms, together\r\nwith Naples and Rome, were to form an Italian Confederation under the\r\npresidency of the Pope. France was to receive Savoy and possibly Nice. A\r\nmarriage between the King's young daughter Clotilde and the Emperor's\r\ncousin Prince Jerome Napoleon was discussed, if not actually settled. [486]\r\n\r\n[Cavour in view of the French Alliance.]\r\n\r\nFrom this moment Cavour laboured night and day for war. His position was an\r\nexceedingly difficult one. Not only had he to reckon with the irresolution\r\nof Napoleon, and his avowed unwillingness to take up arms unless with the\r\nappearance of some good cause; but even supposing the goal of war reached,\r\nand Austria defeated, how little was there in common between Cavour's aims\r\nfor Italy and the traditional policy of France! The first Napoleon had\r\ngiven Venice to Austria at Campo Formio; even if the new Napoleon should\r\nfulfil his promise and liberate all Northern Italy, his policy in regard to\r\nthe centre and south of the Peninsula would probably be antagonistic to any\r\neffective union or to any further extension of the influence of the House\r\nof Savoy. Cavour had therefore to set in readiness for action national\r\nforces of such strength that Napoleon, even if he desired to draw back,\r\nshould find it difficult to do so, and that the shaping of the future of\r\nthe Italian people should be governed not by the schemes which the Emperor\r\nmight devise at Paris, but by the claims and the aspirations of Italy\r\nitself. It was necessary for him not only to encourage and subsidise the\r\nNational Society--a secret association whose branches in the other Italian\r\nStates were preparing to assist Piedmont in the coming war, and to unite\r\nItaly under the House of Savoy--but to enter into communication with some\r\nof the Republican or revolutionary party who had hitherto been at enmity\r\nwith all Crowns alike. He summoned Garibaldi in secrecy to Turin, and there\r\nconvinced him that the war about to be waged by Victor Emmanuel was one in\r\nwhich he ought to take a prominent part. As the foremost defender of the\r\nRoman Republic and a revolutionary hero, Garibaldi was obnoxious to the\r\nFrench Emperor. Cavour had to conceal from Napoleon the fact that Garibaldi\r\nwould take the field at the head of a free-corps by the side of the Allied\r\narmies; he had similarly to conceal from Garibaldi that one result of the\r\nwar would be the cession of Nice, his own birthplace, to France. Thus\r\nplunged in intrigue, driving his Savoyards to the camp and raising from\r\nthem the last farthing in taxation, in order that after victory they might\r\nbe surrendered to a Foreign Power; goading Austria to some act of passion;\r\ninciting, yet checking and controlling, the Italian revolutionary elements;\r\nbargaining away the daughter of his sovereign to one of the most odious of\r\nmankind, Cavour staked all on the one great end of his being, the\r\nestablishment of Italian independence. Words like those which burst from\r\nDanton in the storms of the Convention--\"Perish my name, my reputation, so\r\nthat France be free\"--were the calm and habitual expression of Cavour's\r\nthought when none but an intimate friend was by to hear. [487] Such tasks\r\nas Cavour's are not to be achieved without means which, to a man noble in\r\nview as Cavour really was, it would have been more agreeable to leave\r\nunemployed. Those alone are entitled to pronounce judgment upon him who\r\nhave made a nation, and made it with purer hands. It was well for English\r\nstatesmen and philanthropists, inheritors of a world-wide empire, to\r\nenforce the ethics of peace and to plead for a gentlemanlike frankness and\r\nself-restraint in the conduct of international relations. English women had\r\nnot been flogged by Austrian soldiers in the market-place; the treaties of\r\n1815 had not consecrated a foreign rule over half our race. To Cavour the\r\ngreatest crime would have been to leave anything undone which might\r\nminister to Italy's liberation. [488]\r\n\r\n[Treaty of January, 1859.]\r\n\r\n[Attempts at mediation.]\r\n\r\n[Austrian ultimatum, April 23.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon seems to have considered that he would be ready to begin war in\r\nthe spring of 1859. At the reception at the Tuileries on the 1st of January\r\nhe addressed the Austrian ambassador in words that pointed to an\r\napproaching conflict; a few weeks later a marriage-contract was signed\r\nbetween Prince Napoleon and Clotilde, daughter of Victor Emmanuel, and part\r\nof the agreement made at Plombières was embodied in a formal Treaty.\r\nNapoleon undertook to support Sardinia in a war that might arise from any\r\naggressive act on the part of Austria, and, if victorious, to add both\r\nLombardy and Venetia to Victor Emmanuel's dominions. France was in return\r\nto receive Savoy, the disposal of Nice being reserved till the restoration\r\nof peace. [489] Even before the Treaty was signed Victor Emmanuel had\r\nthrown down the challenge to Austria, declaring at the opening of the\r\nParliament of Turin that he could not be insensible to the cry of suffering\r\nthat rose from Italy. In all but technical form the imminence of war had\r\nbeen announced, when, under the influence of diplomatists and Ministers\r\nabout him, and of a financial panic that followed his address to the\r\nAustrian ambassador, the irresolute mind of Napoleon shrank from its\r\npurpose, and months more of suspense were imposed upon Italy and Europe, to\r\nbe terminated at last not by any effort of Napoleon's will but by the rash\r\nand impolitic action of Austria itself. At the instance of the Court of\r\nVienna the British Government had consented to take steps towards\r\nmediation. Lord Cowley, Ambassador at Paris, was sent to Vienna with\r\nproposals which, it was believed, might form the basis for an amicable\r\nsettlement of Italian affairs. He asked that the Papal States should be\r\nevacuated by both Austrian and French troops; that Austria should abandon\r\nthe Treaties which gave it a virtual Protectorate over Modena and Parma;\r\nand that it should consent to the introduction of reforms in all the\r\nItalian Governments. Negotiations towards this end had made some progress\r\nwhen they were interrupted by a proposal sent from St. Petersburg, at the\r\ninstance of Napoleon, that Italian affairs should be submitted to a\r\nEuropean Congress. Austria was willing under certain conditions to take\r\npart in a Congress, but it required, as a preliminary measure, that\r\nSardinia should disarm. Napoleon had now learnt that Garibaldi was to fight\r\nat the head of the volunteers for Victor Emmanuel. His doubts as to the\r\nwisdom of his own policy seem to have increased hour by hour; from Britain,\r\nwhose friendship he still considered indispensable to him, he received the\r\nmost urgent appeals against war; it was necessary that Cavour himself\r\nshould visit Paris in order to prevent the Emperor from acquiescing in\r\nAustria's demand. In Cavour's presence Napoleon seems to have lost some of\r\nhis fears, or to have been made to feel that it was not safe to provoke his\r\nconfidant of Plombières; [490] but Cavour had not long left Paris when a\r\nproposal was made from London, that in lieu of the separate disarmament of\r\nSardinia the Powers should agree to a general disarmament, the details to\r\nbe settled by a European Commission. This proposal received Napoleon's\r\nassent. He telegraphed to Cavour desiring him to join in the agreement.\r\nCavour could scarcely disobey, yet at one stroke it seemed that all his\r\nhopes when on the very verge of fulfilment were dashed to the ground, all\r\nhis boundless efforts for the liberation of Italy through war with Austria\r\nlost and thrown away. For some hours he appeared shattered by the blow.\r\nStrung to the extreme point of human endurance by labour scarcely remitted\r\nby day or night for weeks together, his strong but sanguine nature gave\r\nway, and for a while the few friends who saw him feared that he would take\r\nhis own life. But the crisis passed: Cavour accepted, as inevitable, the\r\ncondition of general disarmament; and his vigorous mind had already begun\r\nto work upon new plans for the future, when the report of a decision made\r\nat Vienna, which was soon confirmed by the arrival of an Austrian\r\nultimatum, threw him into joy as intense as his previous despair. Ignoring\r\nthe British proposal for a general disarmament, already accepted at Turin,\r\nthe Austrian Cabinet demanded, without qualifications and under threat of\r\nwar within three days, that Sardinia should separately disarm. It was\r\nbelieved at Vienna that Napoleon was merely seeking to gain time; that a\r\nconflict was inevitable; and that Austria now stood better prepared for\r\nimmediate action than its enemies. Right or wrong in its judgment of\r\nNapoleon's real intentions, the Austrian Government had undeniably taken\r\nupon itself the part of the aggressor. Cavour had only to point to his own\r\nacceptance of the plan of a general disarmament, and to throw upon his\r\nenemy the responsibility for a disturbance of European peace. His reply was\r\ntaken as the signal for hostilities, and on the 29th of April Austrian\r\ntroops crossed the Ticino. A declaration of war from Paris followed without\r\ndelay. [491]\r\n\r\n[Campaign of 1859.]\r\n\r\n[Battle of Magenta, June 4.]\r\n\r\nFor months past Austria had been pouring its troops into Northern Italy. It\r\nhad chosen its own time for the commencement of war; a feeble enemy stood\r\nbefore it, its more powerful adversary could not reach the field without\r\ncrossing the Alps or the mountain-range above Genoa. Everything pointed to\r\na vigorous offensive on the part of the Austrian generals, and in Piedmont\r\nitself it was believed that Turin must fall before French troops could\r\nassist in its defence. From Turin as a centre the Austrians could then\r\nstrike with ease, and with superior numbers, against the detachments of the\r\nFrench army as they descended the mountains at any points in the semicircle\r\nfrom Genoa to Mont Cenis. There has seldom been a case where the necessity\r\nand the advantages of a particular line of strategy have been so obvious;\r\nyet after crossing the Ticino the Austrians, above a hundred thousand\r\nstrong, stood as if spell-bound under their incompetent chief, Giulay.\r\nMeanwhile French detachments crossed Mont Cenis; others, more numerous,\r\nlanded with the Emperor at Genoa, and established communications with the\r\nPiedmontese, whose headquarters were at Alessandria. Giulay now believed\r\nthat the Allies would strike upon his communications in the direction of\r\nParma. The march of Bonaparte upon Piacenza in 1796, as well as the\r\ncampaign of Marengo, might well inspire this fear; but the real intention\r\nof Napoleon III. was to outflank the Austrians from the north and so to\r\ngain Milan. Garibaldi was already operating at the extreme left of the\r\nSardinian line in the neighbourhood of Como. While the Piedmontese\r\nmaintained their positions in the front, the French from Genoa marched\r\nnorthwards behind them, crossed the Po, and reached Vercelli before the\r\nAustrians discovered their manoeuvre. Giulay, still lingering between the\r\nSesia and the Ticino, now called up part of his forces northwards, but not\r\nin time to prevent the Piedmontese from crossing the Sesia and defeating\r\nthe troops opposed to them at Palestro (May 30). While the Austrians were\r\noccupied at this point, the French crossed the river farther north, and\r\nmoved eastwards on the Ticino. Giulay was thus outflanked and compelled to\r\nfall back. The Allies followed him, and on the 4th of June attacked the\r\nAustrian army in its positions about Magenta on the road to Milan. The\r\nassault of Macmahon from the north gave the Allies victory after a\r\nhard-fought day. It was impossible for the Austrians to defend Milan; they\r\nretired upon the Adda and subsequently upon the Mincio, abandoning all\r\nLombardy to the invaders, and calling up their troops from Bologna and the\r\nother occupied towns in the Papal States, in order that they might take\r\npart in the defence of the Venetian frontier and the fortresses that\r\nguarded it.\r\n\r\n[Movement in Central Italy.]\r\n\r\nThe victory of the Allies was at once felt throughout Central Italy. The\r\nGrand Duke of Tuscany had already fled from his dominions, and the\r\nDictatorship for the period of the war had been offered by a Provisional\r\nGovernment to Victor Emmanuel, who, while refusing this, had allowed his\r\nenvoy, Boncampagni, to assume temporary powers at Florence as his\r\nrepresentative. The Duke of Modena and the Duchess of Parma now quitted\r\ntheir territories. In the Romagna the disappearance of the Austrians\r\nresulted in the immediate overthrow of Papal authority. Everywhere the\r\ndemand was for union with Piedmont. The calamities of the last ten years\r\nhad taught their lesson to the Italian people. There was now nothing of the\r\ndisorder, the extravagance, the childishness of 1848. The populations who\r\nhad then been so divided, so suspicious, so easy a prey to demagogues, were\r\nnow watchful, self-controlled, and anxious for the guidance of the only\r\nreal national Government. As at Florence, so in the Duchies and in the\r\nRomagna, it was desired that Victor Emmanuel should assume the\r\nDictatorship. The King adhered to the policy which he had adopted towards\r\nTuscany, avoiding any engagement that might compromise him with Europe or\r\nhis ally, but appointing Commissioners to enrol troops for the common war\r\nagainst Austria and to conduct the necessary work of administration in\r\nthose districts. Farini, the historian of the Roman States, was sent to\r\nModena; Azeglio, the ex-Minister, to Bologna. Each of these officers\r\nentered on his task in a spirit worthy of the time; each understood how\r\nmuch might be won for Italy by boldness, how much endangered or lost by\r\nuntimely scruples. [492]\r\n\r\n[Battle of Solferino, June 24.]\r\n\r\nIn his proclamations at the opening of the war Napoleon had declared that\r\nItaly must be freed up to the shore of the Adriatic. His address to the\r\nItalian people on entering Milan with Victor Emmanuel after the victory of\r\nMagenta breathed the same spirit. As yet, however, Lombardy alone had been\r\nwon. The advance of the allied armies was accordingly resumed after an\r\ninterval of some days, and on the 23rd of June they approached the\r\npositions held by the Austrians a little to the west of the Mincio. Francis\r\nJoseph had come from Vienna to take command of the army. His presence\r\nassisted the enemy, inasmuch as he had no plan of his own, and wavered from\r\nday to day between the antagonistic plans of the generals at headquarters.\r\nSome wished to make the Mincio the line of defence, others to hold the\r\nChiese some miles farther west. The consequence was that the army marched\r\nbackwards and forwards across the space between the two rivers according as\r\none or another general gained for the moment the Emperor's confidence. It\r\nwas while the Austrians were thus engaged that the allied armies came into\r\ncontact with them about Solferino. On neither side was it known that the\r\nwhole force of the enemy was close at hand. The battle of Solferino, one of\r\nthe bloodiest of recent times, was fought almost by accident. About a\r\nhundred and fifty thousand men were present under Napoleon and Victor\r\nEmmanuel; the Austrians had a slight superiority in force. On the north,\r\nwhere Benedek with the Austrian right was attacked by the Piedmontese at\r\nSan Martino, it seemed as if the task imposed on the Italian troops was\r\nbeyond their power. Victor Emmanuel, fighting with the same courage as at\r\nNovara, saw the positions in front of his troops alternately won and lost.\r\nBut the success of the French at Solferino in the centre decided the day,\r\nand the Austrians withdrew at last from their whole line with a loss in\r\nkilled and wounded of fourteen thousand men. On the part of the Allies the\r\nslaughter was scarcely less.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon and Prussia.]\r\n\r\n[Interview of Villafranca, July 11.]\r\n\r\n[Peace of Villafranca.]\r\n\r\n[Treaty of Zürich, Nov. 10.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon stood a conqueror, but a conqueror at terrible cost; and in front\r\nof him he saw the fortresses of the Quadrilateral, while new divisions were\r\nhastening from the north and east to the support of the still unbroken\r\nAustrian army. He might well doubt whether, even against his present\r\nantagonist alone, further success was possible. The fearful spectacle of\r\nSolferino, heightened by the effects of overpowering summer heat, probably\r\naffected a mind humane and sensitive and untried in the experience of war.\r\nThe condition of the French army, there is reason to believe, was far\r\ndifferent from that represented in official reports, and likely to make the\r\ncontinuance of the campaign perilous in the extreme. But beyond all this,\r\nthe Emperor knew that if he advanced farther Prussia and all Germany might\r\nat any moment take up arms against him. There had been a strong outburst of\r\nsympathy for Austria in the south-western German States. National\r\npatriotism was excited by the attack of Napoleon on the chief of the German\r\nsovereigns, and the belief was widely spread that French conquest in Italy\r\nwould soon be followed by French conquest on the Rhine. Prussia had\r\nhitherto shown reserve. It would have joined its arms with those of Austria\r\nif its own claims to an improved position in Germany had been granted by\r\nthe Court of Vienna; but Francis Joseph had up to this time refused the\r\nconcessions demanded. In the stress of his peril he might at any moment\r\nclose with the offers which he had before rejected; even without a distinct\r\nagreement between the two Courts, and in mere deference to German public\r\nopinion, Prussia might launch against France the armies which it had\r\nalready brought into readiness for the field. A war upon the Rhine would\r\nthen be added to the war before the Quadrilateral, and from the risks of\r\nthis double effort Napoleon might well shrink in the interest of France not\r\nless than of his own dynasty. He determined to seek an interview with\r\nFrancis Joseph, and to ascertain on what terms peace might now be made. The\r\ninterview took place at Villafranca, east of the Mincio, on the 11th of\r\nJuly. Francis Joseph refused to cede any part of Venetia without a further\r\nstruggle. He was willing to give up Lombardy, and to consent to the\r\nestablishment of an Italian Federation under the presidency of the Pope, of\r\nwhich Federation Venetia, still under Austria's rule, should be a member;\r\nbut he required that Mantua should be left within his own frontier, and\r\nthat the sovereigns of Tuscany and Modena should resume possession of their\r\ndominions. To these terms Napoleon assented, on obtaining a verbal\r\nagreement that the dispossessed princes should not be restored by foreign\r\narms. Regarding Parma and the restoration of the Papal authority in the\r\nRomagna no stipulations were made. With the signature of the Preliminaries\r\nof Villafranca, which were to form the base of a regular Treaty to be\r\nnegotiated at Zürich, and to which Victor Emmanuel added his name with\r\nwords of reservation, hostilities came to a close. The negotiations at\r\nZürich, though they lasted for several months, added nothing of importance\r\nto the matter of the Preliminaries, and decided nothing that had been left\r\nin uncertainty. The Italian Federation remained a scheme which the two\r\nEmperors, and they alone, undertook to promote. Piedmont entered into no\r\nengagement either with regard to the Duchies or with regard to Federation.\r\nVictor Emmanuel had in fact announced from the first that he would enter no\r\nLeague of which a province governed by Austria formed a part, and from this\r\nresolution he never swerved. [493]\r\n\r\n[Resignation of Cavour.]\r\n\r\n[Central Italy.]\r\n\r\nThough Lombardy was gained, the impression made upon the Italians by the\r\npeace of Villafranca was one of the utmost dismay. Napoleon had so\r\nconfidently and so recently promised the liberation of all Northern Italy\r\nthat public opinion ascribed to treachery or weakness what was in truth an\r\nact of political necessity. On the first rumour of the negotiations Cavour\r\nhad hurried from Turin, but the agreement was signed before his arrival.\r\nThe anger and the grief of Cavour are described by those who then saw him\r\nas terrible to witness. [494] Napoleon had not the courage to face him;\r\nVictor Emmanuel bore for two hours the reproaches of his Minister, who had\r\nnow completely lost his self-control. Cavour returned to Turin, and shortly\r\nafterwards withdrew from office, his last act being the despatch of ten\r\nthousand muskets to Farini at Modena. In accordance with the terms of\r\npeace, instructions, which were probably not meant to be obeyed, were sent\r\nby Cavour's successor, Rattazzi, to the Piedmontese Commissioners in\r\nCentral Italy, bidding them to return to Turin and to disband any forces\r\nthat they had collected. Farini, on receipt of this order, adroitly\r\ndivested himself of his Piedmontese citizenship, and, as an honorary\r\nburgher of Modena, accepted the Dictatorship from his fellow-townsmen.\r\nAzeglio returned to Turin, but took care before quitting the Romagna to\r\nplace four thousand soldiers under competent leaders in a position to\r\nresist attack. It was not the least of Cavour's merits that he had gathered\r\nabout him a body of men who, when his own hand was for a while withdrawn,\r\ncould pursue his policy with so much energy and sagacity as was now shown\r\nby the leaders of the national movement in Central Italy. Venetia was lost\r\nfor the present; but if Napoleon's promise was broken, districts which he\r\nhad failed or had not intended to liberate might be united with the Italian\r\nKingdom. The Duke of Modena, with six thousand men who had remained true to\r\nhim, lay on the Austrian frontier, and threatened to march upon his\r\ncapital. Farini mined the city gates, and armed so considerable a force\r\nthat it became clear that the Duke would not recover his dominions without\r\na serious battle. Parma placed itself under the same Dictatorship with\r\nModena; in the Romagna a Provisional Government which Azeglio had left\r\nbehind him continued his work. Tuscany, where Napoleon had hoped to find a\r\nthrone for his cousin, pronounced for national union, and organised a\r\ncommon military force with its neighbours. During the weeks that followed\r\nthe Peace of Villafranca, declarations signed by tens of thousands, the\r\nvotes of representative bodies, and popular demonstrations throughout\r\nCentral Italy, showed in an orderly and peaceful form how universal was the\r\ndesire for union under the House of Savoy.\r\n\r\n[Cavour's Plans before Villafranca.]\r\n\r\n[Central Italy after Villafranca. July-November.]\r\n\r\n[Mazzini and Garibaldi. August-November.]\r\n\r\nCavour, in the plans which he had made before 1859, had not looked for a\r\ndirect and immediate result beyond the creation of an Italian Kingdom\r\nincluding the whole of the territory north of the Po. The other steps in\r\nthe consolidation of Italy would, he believed, follow in their order. They\r\nmight be close at hand, or they might be delayed for a while; but in the\r\nexpulsion of Austria, in the interposition of a purely Italian State\r\nnumbering above ten millions of inhabitants, mistress of the fortresses and\r\nof a powerful fleet, between Austria and those who had been its vassals,\r\nthe essential conditions of Italian national independence would have been\r\nwon. For the rest, Italy might be content to wait upon time and\r\nopportunity. But the Peace of Villafranca, leaving Venetia in the enemy's\r\nhands, completely changed this prospect. The fiction of an Italian\r\nFederation in which the Hapsburg Emperor, as lord of Venice, should forget\r\nhis Austrian interests and play the part of Italian patriot, was too gross\r\nto deceive any one. Italy, on these terms, would either continue to be\r\ngoverned from Vienna, or be made a pawn in the hands of its French\r\nprotector. What therefore Cavour had hitherto been willing to leave to\r\nfuture years now became the need of the present. \"Before Villafranca,\" in\r\nhis own words, \"the union of Italy was a possibility; since Villafranca it\r\nis a necessity.\" Victor Emmanuel understood this too, and saw the need for\r\naction more clearly than Rattazzi and the Ministers who, on Cavour's\r\nwithdrawal in July, stepped for a few months into his place. The situation\r\nwas one that called indeed for no mean exercise of statesmanship. If Italy\r\nwas not to be left dependent upon the foreigner and the reputation of the\r\nHouse of Savoy ruined, it was necessary not only that the Duchies of Modena\r\nand Parma, but that Central Italy, including Tuscany and at least the\r\nRomagna, should be united with the Kingdom of Piedmont; yet the\r\naccomplishment of this work was attended with the utmost danger. Napoleon\r\nhimself was hoping to form Tuscany, with an augmented territory, into a\r\nrival Kingdom of Etruria or Central Italy, and to place his cousin on its\r\nthrone. The Ultramontane party in France was alarmed and indignant at the\r\noverthrow of the Pope's authority in the Romagna, and already called upon\r\nthe Emperor to fulfil his duties towards the Holy See. If the national\r\nmovement should extend to Rome itself, the hostile intervention of France\r\nwas almost inevitable. While the negotiations with Austria at Zürich were\r\nstill proceeding, Victor Emmanuel could not safely accept the sovereignty\r\nthat was offered him by Tuscany and the neighbouring provinces, nor permit\r\nhis cousin, the Prince of Carignano, to assume the regency which, during\r\nthe period of suspense, it was proposed to confer upon him. Above all, it\r\nwas necessary that the Government should not allow the popular forces with\r\nwhich it was co-operating to pass beyond its own control. In the critical\r\nperiod that followed the armistice of Villafranca, Mazzini approached\r\nVictor Emmanuel, as thirty years before he had approached his father, and\r\noffered his own assistance in the establishment of Italian union under the\r\nHouse of Savoy. He proposed, as the first step, to overthrow the Neapolitan\r\nGovernment by means of an expedition headed by Garibaldi, and to unite\r\nSicily and Naples to the King's dominions; but he demanded in return that\r\nPiedmont should oppose armed resistance to any foreign intervention\r\noccasioned by this enterprise; and he seems also to have required that an\r\nattack should be made immediately afterwards upon Rome and upon Venetia. To\r\nthese conditions the King could not accede; and Mazzini, confirmed in his\r\nattitude of distrust towards the Court of Turin, turned to Garibaldi, who\r\nwas now at Modena. At his instigation Garibaldi resolved to lead an\r\nexpedition at once against Rome itself. Napoleon was at this very moment\r\npromising reforms on behalf of the Pope, and warning Victor Emmanuel\r\nagainst the annexation even of the Romagna (Oct. 20th). At the risk of\r\nincurring the hostility of Garibaldi's followers and throwing their leader\r\ninto opposition to the dynasty, it was necessary for the Sardinian\r\nGovernment to check him in his course. The moment was a critical one in the\r\nhistory of the House of Savoy. But the soldier of Republican Italy proved\r\nmore tractable than its prophet. Garibaldi was persuaded to abandon or\r\npostpone an enterprise which could only have resulted in disaster for\r\nItaly; and with expressions of cordiality towards the King himself, and of\r\nbitter contempt for the fox-like politicians who advised him, he resigned\r\nhis command and bade farewell to his comrades, recommending them, however,\r\nto remain under arms, in full confidence that they would ere long find a\r\nbetter opportunity for carrying the national flag southwards. [495]\r\n\r\n[The proposed Congress.]\r\n\r\nSoon after the Agreement of Villafranca, Napoleon had proposed to the\r\nBritish Government that a Congress of all the Powers should assemble at\r\nParis in order to decide upon the many Italian questions which still\r\nremained unsettled. In taking upon himself the emancipation of Northern\r\nItaly Napoleon had, as it proved, attempted a task far beyond his own\r\npowers. The work had been abruptly broken off; the promised services had\r\nnot been rendered, the stipulated reward had not been won. On the other\r\nhand, forces had been set in motion which he who raised them could not\r\nallay; populations stood in arms against the Governments which the\r\nAgreement of Villafranca purported to restore; the Pope's authority in the\r\nnorthern part of his dominions was at an end; the Italian League over which\r\nFrance and Austria were to join hands of benediction remained the\r\nlaughing-stock of Europe. Napoleon's victories had added Lombardy to\r\nPiedmont; for the rest, except from the Italian point of view, they had\r\nonly thrown affairs into confusion. Hesitating at the first between his\r\nobligations towards Austria and the maintenance of his prestige in Italy,\r\nperplexed between the contradictory claims of nationality and of\r\nUltramontanism, Napoleon would gladly have cast upon Great Britain, or upon\r\nEurope at large, the task of extricating him from his embarrassment. But\r\nthe Cabinet of London, while favourable to Italy, showed little inclination\r\nto entangle itself in engagements which might lead to war with Austria and\r\nGermany in the interest of the French Sovereign. Italian affairs, it was\r\nurged by Lord John Russell, might well be governed by the course of events\r\nwithin Italy itself; and, as Austria remained inactive, the principle of\r\nnon-intervention really gained the day. The firm attitude of the population\r\nboth in the Duchies and in the Romagna, their unanimity and self-control,\r\nthe absence of those disorders which had so often been made a pretext for\r\nforeign intervention, told upon the mind of Napoleon and on the opinion of\r\nEurope at large. Each month that passed rendered the restoration of the\r\nfallen Governments a work of greater difficulty, and increased the\r\nconfidence of the Italians in themselves. Napoleon watched and wavered.\r\nWhen the Treaty of Zürich was signed his policy was still undetermined. By\r\nthe prompt and liberal concession of reforms the Papal Government might\r\nperhaps even now have turned the balance in its favour. But the obstinate\r\nmind of Pius IX. was proof against every politic and every generous\r\ninfluence. The stubbornness shown by Rome, the remembrance of Antonelli's\r\nconduct towards the French Republic in 1849, possibly also the discovery of\r\na Treaty of Alliance between the Papal Government and Austria, at length\r\novercame Napoleon's hesitation in meeting the national demand of Italy, and\r\ngave him courage to defy both the Papal Court and the French priesthood. He\r\nresolved to consent to the formation of an Italian Kingdom under Victor\r\nEmmanuel including the northern part of the Papal territories as well as\r\nTuscany and the other Duchies, and to silence the outcry which this act of\r\nspoliation would excite among the clerical party in France by the\r\nannexation of Nice and Savoy.\r\n\r\n[\"The Pope and the Congress,\" Dec. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Change of Ministry at Paris, Jan. 5, 1860.]\r\n\r\n[Cavour resumes office, Jan. 16.]\r\n\r\nThe decision of the Emperor was foreshadowed by the publication on the 24th\r\nof December of a pamphlet entitled \"The Pope and the Congress.\" The\r\ndoctrine advanced in this essay was that, although a temporal authority was\r\nnecessary to the Pope's spiritual independence, the peace and unity which\r\nshould surround the Vicar of Christ would be best attained when his\r\ntemporal sovereignty was reduced within the narrowest possible limits. Rome\r\nand the territory immediately around it, if guaranteed to the Pope by the\r\nGreat Powers, would be sufficient for the temporal needs of the Holy See.\r\nThe revenue lost by the separation of the remainder of the Papal\r\nterritories might be replaced by a yearly tribute of reverence paid by the\r\nCatholic Powers to the Head of the Church. That the pamphlet advocating\r\nthis policy was written at the dictation of Napoleon was not made a secret.\r\nIts appearance occasioned an indignant protest at Rome. The Pope announced\r\nthat he would take no part in the proposed Congress unless the doctrines\r\nadvanced in the pamphlet were disavowed by the French Government. Napoleon\r\nin reply submitted to the Pope that he would do well to purchase the\r\nguarantee of the Powers for the remainder of his territories by giving up\r\nall claim to the Romagna, which he had already lost. Pius retorted that he\r\ncould not cede what Heaven had granted, not to himself, but to the Church;\r\nand that if the Powers would but clear the Romagna of Piedmontese intruders\r\nhe would soon reconquer the rebellious province without the assistance\r\neither of France or of Austria. The attitude assumed by the Papal Court\r\ngave Napoleon a good pretext for abandoning the plan of a European\r\nCongress, from which he could hardly expect to obtain a grant of Nice and\r\nSavoy. It was announced at Paris that the Congress would be postponed; and\r\non the 5th of January, 1860, the change in Napoleon's policy was publicly\r\nmarked by the dismissal of his Foreign Minister, Walewski, and the\r\nappointment in his place of Thouvenel, a friend to Italian union. Ten days\r\nlater Rattazzi gave up office at Turin, and Cavour returned to power.\r\n\r\n[Cavour and Napoleon, Jan-March.]\r\n\r\n[Union of the Duchies and the Romagna with Piedmont, March.]\r\n\r\n[Savoy and Nice ceded to France.]\r\n\r\nRattazzi, during the six months that he had conducted affairs, had steered\r\nsafely past some dangerous rocks; but he held the helm with an unsteady and\r\nuntrusted hand, and he appears to have displayed an unworthy jealousy\r\ntowards Cavour, who, while out of office, had not ceased to render what\r\nservices he could to his country. Cavour resumed his post, with the resolve\r\nto defer no longer the annexation of Central Italy, but with the heavy\r\nconsciousness that Napoleon would demand in return for his consent to this\r\nunion the cession of Nice and Savoy. No Treaty entitled France to claim\r\nthis reward, for the Austrians still held Venetia; but Napoleon's troops\r\nlay at Milan, and by a march southwards they could easily throw Italian\r\naffairs again into confusion, and undo all that the last six months had\r\neffected. Cavour would perhaps have lent himself to any European\r\ncombination which, while directed against the extension, of France, would\r\nhave secured the existence of the Italian Kingdom; but no such alternative\r\nto the French alliance proved possible; and the subsequent negotiations\r\nbetween Paris and Turin were intended only to vest with a certain\r\ndiplomatic propriety the now inevitable transfer of territory from the\r\nweaker to the stronger State. A series of propositions made from London\r\nwith the view of withdrawing from Italy both French and Austrian influence\r\nled the Austrian Court to acknowledge that its army would not be employed\r\nfor the restoration of the sovereigns of Tuscany and Modena. Construing\r\nthis statement as an admission that the stipulations of Villafranca and\r\nZürich as to the return of the fugitive princes had become impracticable,\r\nNapoleon now suggested that Victor Emmanuel should annex Parma and Modena,\r\nand assume secular power in the Romagna as Vicar of the Pope, leaving\r\nTuscany to form a separate Government. The establishment of so powerful a\r\nkingdom on the confines of France was, he added, not in accordance with the\r\ntraditions of French foreign policy, and in self-defence France must\r\nrectify its military frontier by the acquisition of Nice and Savoy (Feb.\r\n24th). Cavour well understood that the mention of Tuscan independence, and\r\nthe qualified recognition of the Pope's rights in the Romagna, were no more\r\nthan suggestions of the means of pressure by which France might enforce the\r\ncessions it required. He answered that, although Victor Emmanuel could not\r\nalienate any part of his dominions, his Government recognised the same\r\npopular rights in Savoy and Nice as in Central Italy; and accordingly that\r\nif the population of these districts declared in a legal form their desire\r\nto be incorporated with France, the King would not resist their will.\r\nHaving thus consented to the necessary sacrifice, and ignoring Napoleon's\r\nreservations with regard to Tuscany and the Pope, Cavour gave orders that a\r\npopular vote should at once be taken in Tuscany, as well as in Parma,\r\nModena, and the Romagna, on the question of union with Piedmont. The voting\r\ntook place early in March, and gave an overwhelming majority in favour of\r\nunion. The Pope issued the major excommunication against the authors,\r\nabettors, and agents in this work of sacrilege, and heaped curses on\r\ncurses; but no one seemed the worse for them. Victor Emmanuel accepted the\r\nsovereignty that was offered to him, and on the 2nd of April the Parliament\r\nof the united kingdom assembled at Turin. It had already been announced to\r\nthe inhabitants of Nice and Savoy that the King had consented to their\r\nunion with France. The formality of a _plébiscite_ was enacted a few\r\ndays later, and under the combined pressure of the French and Sardinian\r\nGovernments the desired results were obtained. Not more than a few hundred\r\npersons protested by their vote against a transaction to which it was\r\nunderstood that the King had no choice but to submit. [496]\r\n\r\n[Cavour on the cession of Nice and Savoy.]\r\n\r\nThat Victor Emmanuel had at one time been disposed to resist Cavour's\r\nsurrender of the home of his race is well known. Above a year, however, had\r\npassed since the project had been accepted as the basis of the French\r\nalliance; and if, during the interval of suspense after Villafranca, the\r\nKing had cherished a hope that the sacrifice might be avoided without\r\nprejudice either to the cause of Italy or to his own relations with\r\nNapoleon, Cavour had entertained no such illusions. He knew that the\r\ncession was an indispensable link in the chain of his own policy, that\r\npolicy which had made it possible to defeat Austria, and which, he\r\nbelieved, would lead to the further consolidation of Italy. Looking to\r\nRome, to Palermo, where the smouldering fire might at any moment blaze out,\r\nhe could not yet dispense with the friendship of Napoleon, he could not\r\nprovoke the one man powerful enough to shape the action of France in\r\ndefiance of Clerical and of Legitimist aims. Rattazzi might claim credit\r\nfor having brought Piedmont past the Treaty of Zürich without loss of\r\nterritory; Cavour, in a far finer spirit, took upon himself the\r\nresponsibility for the sacrifice made to France, and bade the Parliament of\r\nItaly pass judgment upon his act. The cession of the border-provinces\r\novershadowed what would otherwise have been the brightest scene in Italian\r\nhistory for many generations, the meeting of the first North-Italian\r\nParliament at Turin. Garibaldi, coming as deputy from his birthplace, Nice,\r\nuttered words of scorn and injustice against the man who had made him an\r\nalien in Italy, and quitted the Chamber. Bitterly as Cavour felt, both now\r\nand down to the end of his life, the reproaches that were levelled against\r\nhim, he allowed no trace of wounded feeling, of impatience, of the sense of\r\nwrong, to escape him in the masterly speech in which he justified his\r\npolicy and won for it the ratification of the Parliament. It was not until\r\na year later, when the hand of death was almost upon him, that fierce words\r\naddressed to him face to face by Garibaldi wrung from him the impressive\r\nanswer, \"The act that has made this gulf between us was the most painful\r\nduty of my life. By what I have felt myself I know what Garibaldi must have\r\nfelt. If he refuses me his forgiveness I cannot reproach him for it.\" [497]\r\n\r\n[The cession in relation to Europe and Italy.]\r\n\r\nThe annexation of Nice and Savoy by Napoleon was seen with extreme\r\ndispleasure in Europe generally, and most of all in England. It directly\r\naffected the history of Britain by the stimulus which it gave to the\r\ndevelopment of the Volunteer Forces. Owing their origin to certain\r\ndemonstrations of hostility towards England made by the French army after\r\nOrsini's conspiracy and the acquittal of one of his confederates in London,\r\nthe Volunteer Forces rose in the three months that followed the annexation\r\nof Nice and Savoy from seventy to a hundred and eighty thousand men. If\r\nviewed as an indication that the ruler of France would not be content with\r\nthe frontiers of 1815, the acquisition of the Sub-Alpine provinces might\r\nwith some reason excite alarm; on no other ground could their transfer be\r\njustly condemned. Geographical position, language, commercial interests,\r\nseparated Savoy from Piedmont and connected it with France; and though in\r\ncertain parts of the County of Nice the Italian character predominated,\r\nthis district as a whole bore the stamp not of Piedmont or Liguria but of\r\nProvence. Since the separation from France in 1815 there had always been,\r\nboth in Nice and Savoy, a considerable party which desired reunion with\r\nthat country. The political and social order of the Sardinian Kingdom had\r\nfrom 1815 to 1848 been so backward, so reactionary, that the middle classes\r\nin the border-provinces looked wistfully to France as a land where their\r\nown grievances had been removed and their own ideals attained. The\r\nconstitutional system of Victor Emmanuel, and the despotic system of Louis\r\nNapoleon had both been too recently introduced to reverse in the minds of\r\nthe greater number the political tradition of the preceding thirty years.\r\nThus if there were a few who, like Garibaldi, himself of Genoese descent\r\nthough born at Nice, passionately resented separation from Italy, they\r\nfound no considerable party either in Nice or in Savoy animated by the same\r\nfeeling. On the other hand, the ecclesiastical sentiment of Savoy rendered\r\nits transfer to France an actual advantage to the Italian State. The Papacy\r\nhad here a deeply-rooted influence. The reforms begun by Azeglio's Ministry\r\nhad been steadily resisted by a Savoyard group of deputies in the interests\r\nof Rome. Cavour himself, in the prosecution of his larger plans, had always\r\nbeen exposed to the danger of a coalition between this ultra-Conservative\r\nparty and his opponents of the other extreme. It was well that in the\r\nconflict with the Papacy, without which there could be no such thing as a\r\nKingdom of United Italy, these influences of the Savoyard Church and\r\nNoblesse should be removed from the Parliament and the Throne. Honourable\r\nas the Savoyard party of resistance had proved themselves in Parliamentary\r\nlife, loyal and faithful as they were to their sovereign, they were yet not\r\na part of the Italian nation. Their interests were not bound up with the\r\ncause of Italian union; their leaders were not inspired with the ideal of\r\nItalian national life. The forces that threatened the future of the new\r\nState from within were too powerful for the surrender of a priest-governed\r\nand half-foreign element to be considered as a real loss.\r\n\r\n[Naples.]\r\n\r\nNice and Savoy had hardly been handed over to Napoleon when Garibaldi set\r\nout from Genoa to effect the liberation of Sicily and Naples. King\r\nFerdinand II., known to his subjects and to Western Europe as King Bomba,\r\nhad died a few days before the battle of Magenta, leaving the throne to his\r\nson Francis II. In consequence of the friendship shown by Ferdinand to\r\nRussia during the Crimean War, and of his refusal to amend his tyrannical\r\nsystem of government, the Western Powers had in 1856 withdrawn their\r\nrepresentatives from Naples. On the accession of Francis II. diplomatic\r\nintercourse was renewed, and Cavour, who had been at bitter enmity with\r\nFerdinand, sought to establish relations of friendship with his son. In the\r\nwar against Austria an alliance with Naples would have been of value to\r\nSardinia as a counterpoise to Napoleon's influence, and this alliance\r\nCavour attempted to obtain. He was, however, unsuccessful; and after the\r\nPeace of Villafranca the Neapolitan Court threw itself with ardour into\r\nschemes for the restoration of the fallen Governments and the overthrow of\r\nPiedmontese authority in the Romagna by means of a coalition with Austria\r\nand Spain and a counterrevolutionary movement in Italy itself. A rising on\r\nbehalf of the fugitive Grand Duke of Tuscany was to give the signal for the\r\nmarch of the Neapolitan army northwards. This rising, however, was expected\r\nin vain, and the great Catholic design resulted in nothing. Baffled in its\r\nlarger aims, the Bourbon Government proposed in the spring of 1860 to\r\noccupy Umbria and the Marches, in order to prevent the revolutionary\r\nmovement from spreading farther into the Papal States. Against this Cavour\r\nprotested, and King Francis yielded to his threat to withdraw the Sardinian\r\nambassador from Naples. Knowing that a conspiracy existed for the\r\nrestoration of the House of Murat to the Neapolitan throne, which would\r\nhave given France the ascendency in Southern Italy, Cavour now renewed his\r\ndemand that Francis II. should enter into alliance with Piedmont, accepting\r\na constitutional system of government and the national Italian policy of\r\nVictor Emmanuel. But neither the summons from Turin, nor the agitation of\r\nthe Muratists, nor the warnings of Great Britain that the Bourbon dynasty\r\ncould only avert its fall by reform, produced any real change in the spirit\r\nof the Neapolitan Court. Ministers were removed, but the absolutist and\r\nanti-national system remained the same. Meanwhile Garibaldi was gathering\r\nhis followers round him in Genoa. On the 15th of April Victor Emmanuel\r\nwrote to King Francis that unless his fatal system of policy was\r\nimmediately abandoned the Piedmontese Government itself might shortly be\r\nforced to become the agent of his destruction. Even this menace proved\r\nfruitless; and after thus fairly exposing to the Court of Naples the\r\nconsequence of its own stubbornness, Victor Emmanuel let loose against it\r\nthe revolutionary forces of Garibaldi.\r\n\r\n[Sicily.]\r\n\r\n[Garibaldi starts for Sicily, May 5.]\r\n\r\n[Garibaldi at Marsala, May 11.]\r\n\r\nSince the campaign of 1859 insurrectionary committees had been active in\r\nthe principal Sicilian towns. The old desire of the Sicilian Liberals for\r\nthe independence of the island had given place, under the influence of the\r\nevents of the past year, to the desire for Italian union. On the\r\nabandonment of Garibaldi's plan for the march on Rome in November, 1859,\r\nthe liberation of Sicily had been suggested to him as a more feasible\r\nenterprise, and the general himself wavered in the spring of 1860 between\r\nthe resumption of his Roman project and an attack upon the Bourbons of\r\nNaples from the south. The rumour spread through Sicily that Garibaldi\r\nwould soon appear there at the head of his followers. On the 3rd of April\r\nan attempt at insurrection was made at Palermo. It was repressed without\r\ndifficulty; and although disturbances broke out in other parts of the\r\nisland, the reports which reached Garibaldi at Genoa as to the spirit and\r\nprospects of the Sicilians were so disheartening that for a while he seemed\r\ndisposed to abandon the project of invasion as hopeless for the present. It\r\nwas only when some of the Sicilian exiles declared that they would risk the\r\nenterprise without him that he resolved upon immediate action. On the night\r\nof the 5th of May two steamships lying in the harbour of Genoa were seized,\r\nand on these Garibaldi with his Thousand put to sea. Cavour, though he\r\nwould have preferred that Sicily should remain unmolested until some\r\nprogress had been made in the consolidation of the North Italian Kingdom,\r\ndid not venture to restrain Garibaldi's movements, with which he was well\r\nacquainted. He required, however, that the expedition should not touch at\r\nthe island of Sardinia, and gave ostensible orders to his admiral, Persano,\r\nto seize the ships of Garibaldi if they should put into any Sardinian port.\r\nGaribaldi, who had sheltered the Sardinian Government from responsibility\r\nat the outset by the fiction of a sudden capture of the two merchant-ships,\r\ncontinued to spare Victor Emmanuel unnecessary difficulties by avoiding the\r\nfleet which was supposed to be on the watch for him off Cagliari in\r\nSardinia, and only interrupted his voyage by a landing at a desolate spot\r\non the Tuscan coast in order to take up artillery and ammunition which were\r\nwaiting for him there. On the 11th of May, having heard from some English\r\nmerchantmen that there were no Neapolitan vessels of war at Marsala, he\r\nmade for this harbour. The first of his two ships entered it in safety and\r\ndisembarked her crew; the second, running on a rock, lay for some time\r\nwithin range of the guns of a Neapolitan war-steamer which was bearing up\r\ntowards the port. But for some unknown reason the Neapolitan commander\r\ndelayed opening fire, and the landing of Garibaldi's followers was during\r\nthis interval completed without loss. [498]\r\n\r\n[Garibaldi captures Palermo, May 26.]\r\n\r\nOn the following day the little army, attired in the red shirts which are\r\nworn by cattle-ranchers in South America, marched eastwards from Marsala.\r\nBands of villagers joined them as they moved through the country, and many\r\nunexpected adherents were gained among the priests. On the third day's\r\nmarch Neapolitan troops were seen in position at Calatafimi. They were\r\nattacked by Garibaldi, and, though far superior in number, were put to the\r\nrout. The moral effects of this first victory were very great. The\r\nNeapolitan commander retired into Palermo, leaving Garibaldi master of the\r\nwestern portion of the island. Insurrection spread towards the interior;\r\nthe revolutionary party at Palermo itself regained its courage and prepared\r\nto co-operate with Garibaldi on his approach. On nearing the city Garibaldi\r\ndetermined that he could not risk a direct assault upon the forces which\r\noccupied it. He resolved, if possible, to lure part of the defenders into\r\nthe mountains, and during their absence to throw himself into the city and\r\nto trust to the energy of its inhabitants to maintain himself there. This\r\nstrategy succeeded. While the officer in command of some of the Neapolitan\r\nbattalions, tempted by an easy victory over the ill-disciplined Sicilian\r\nbands opposed to him, pursued his beaten enemy into the mountains,\r\nGaribaldi with the best of his troops fought his way into Palermo on the\r\nnight of May 26th. Fighting continued in the streets during the next two\r\ndays, and the cannon of the forts and of the Neapolitan vessels in harbour\r\nineffectually bombarded the city. On the 30th, at the moment when the\r\nabsent battalions were coming again into sight, an armistice was signed on\r\nboard the British man-of-war _Hannibal_. The Neapolitan commander gave\r\nup to Garibaldi the bank and public buildings, and withdrew into the forts\r\noutside the town. But the Government at Naples was now becoming thoroughly\r\nalarmed; and considering Palermo as lost, it directed the troops to be\r\nshipped to Messina and to Naples itself. Garibaldi was thus left in\r\nundisputed possession of the Sicilian capital. He remained there for nearly\r\ntwo months, assuming the government of Sicily as Dictator in the name of\r\nVictor Emmanuel, appointing Ministers, and levying taxes. Heavy\r\nreinforcements reached him from Italy. The Neapolitans, driven from the\r\ninterior as well as from the towns occupied by the invader, now held only\r\nthe north-eastern extremity of the island. On the 20th of July Garibaldi,\r\noperating both by land and sea, attacked and defeated them at Milazzo on\r\nthe northern coast. The result of this victory was that Messina itself,\r\nwith the exception of the citadel, was evacuated by the Neapolitans without\r\nresistance. Garibaldi, whose troops now numbered eighteen thousand, was\r\nmaster of the island from sea to sea, and could with confidence look\r\nforward to the overthrow of Bourbon authority on the Italian mainland.\r\n\r\n[The Party of Action.]\r\n\r\nDuring Garibaldi's stay at Palermo the antagonism between the two political\r\ncreeds which severed those whose devotion to Italy was the strongest came\r\nclearly into view. This antagonism stood embodied in its extreme form in\r\nthe contrast between Mazzini and Cavour. Mazzini, handling moral and\r\npolitical conceptions with something of the independence of a\r\nmathematician, laid it down as the first duty of the Italian nation to\r\npossess itself of Rome and Venice, regardless of difficulties that might be\r\nraised from without. By conviction he desired that Italy should be a\r\nRepublic, though under certain conditions he might be willing to tolerate\r\nthe monarchy of Victor Emmanuel. Cavour, accurately observing the play of\r\npolitical forces in Europe, conscious above all of the strength of those\r\nties which still bound Napoleon to the clerical cause, knew that there were\r\nlimits which Italy could not at present pass without ruin. The centre of\r\nMazzini's hopes, an advance upon Rome itself, he knew to be an act of\r\nself-destruction for Italy, and this advance he was resolved at all costs\r\nto prevent. Cavour had not hindered the expedition to Sicily; he had not\r\nconsidered it likely to embroil Italy with its ally; but neither had he\r\nbeen the author of this enterprise. The liberation of Sicily might be\r\ndeemed the work rather of the school of Mazzini than of Cavour. Garibaldi\r\nindeed was personally loyal to Victor Emmanuel; but around him there were\r\nmen who, if not Republicans, were at least disposed to make the grant of\r\nSicily to Victor Emmanuel conditional upon the king's fulfilling the will\r\nof the so-called Party of Action, and consenting to an attack upon Rome.\r\nUnder the influence of these politicians Garibaldi, in reply to a\r\ndeputation expressing to him the desire of the Sicilians for union with the\r\nKingdom of Victor Emmanuel, declared that he had come to fight not for\r\nSicily alone but for all Italy, and that if the annexation of Sicily was to\r\ntake place before the union of Italy was assured, he must withdraw his hand\r\nfrom the work and retire. The effect produced by these words of Garibaldi\r\nwas so serious that the Ministers whom he had placed in office resigned.\r\nGaribaldi endeavoured to substitute for them men more agreeable to the\r\nParty of Action, but a demonstration in Palermo itself forced him to\r\nnominate Sicilians in favour of immediate annexation. The public opinion of\r\nthe island was hostile to Republicanism and to the friends of Mazzini; nor\r\ncould the prevailing anarchy long continue without danger of a reactionary\r\nmovement. Garibaldi himself possessed no glimmer of administrative faculty.\r\nAfter weeks of confusion and misgovernment he saw the necessity of\r\naccepting direction from Turin, and consented to recognise as Pro-Dictator\r\nof the island a nominee of Cavour, the Piedmontese Depretis. Under the\r\ninfluence of Depretis a commencement was made in the work of political and\r\nsocial reorganisation. [499]\r\n\r\n[Cavour's policy with regard to Naples.]\r\n\r\n[Garibaldi crosses to the mainland, Aug. 19.]\r\n\r\nCavour, during Garibaldi's preparation for his descent upon Sicily and\r\nuntil the capture of Palermo, had affected to disavow and condemn the\r\nenterprise as one undertaken by individuals in spite of the Government, and\r\nat their own risk. The Piedmontese ambassador was still at Naples as the\r\nrepresentative of a friendly Court; and in reply to the reproaches of\r\nGermany and Russia, Cavour alleged that the title of Dictator of Sicily in\r\nthe name of Victor Emmanuel had been assumed by Garibaldi without the\r\nknowledge or consent of his sovereign. But whatever might be said to\r\nForeign Powers, Cavour, from the time of the capture of Palermo, recognised\r\nthat the hour had come for further steps towards Italian union; and,\r\nwithout committing himself to any definite line of action, he began already\r\nto contemplate the overthrow of the Bourbon dynasty at Naples. It was in\r\nvain that King Francis now released his political prisoners, declared the\r\nConstitution of 1848 in force, and tendered to Piedmont the alliance which\r\nhe had before refused. Cavour, in reply to his overtures, stated that he\r\ncould not on his own authority pledge Piedmont to the support of a dynasty\r\nnow almost in the agonies of dissolution, and that the matter must await\r\nthe meeting of Parliament at Turin. Thus far the way had not been\r\nabsolutely closed to a reconciliation between the two Courts; but after the\r\nvictory of Garibaldi at Milazzo and the evacuation of Messina at the end of\r\nJuly Cavour cast aside all hesitation and reserve. He appears to have\r\nthought a renewal of the war with Austria probable, and now strained every\r\nnerve to become master of Naples and its fleet before Austria could take\r\nthe field. He ordered Admiral Persano to leave two ships of war to cover\r\nGaribaldi's passage to the mainland, and with one ship to proceed to Naples\r\nhimself, and there excite insurrection and win over the Neapolitan fleet to\r\nthe flag of Victor Emmanuel. Persano reached Naples on the 3rd of August,\r\nand on the next day the negotiations between the two Courts were broken\r\noff. On the 19th Garibaldi crossed from Sicily to the mainland. His march\r\nupon the capital was one unbroken triumph.\r\n\r\n[Persano and Villamarina at Naples.]\r\n\r\n[Departure of King Francis, Sept. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Garibaldi enters Naples, Sept. 7.]\r\n\r\nIt was the hope of Cavour that before Garibaldi could reach Naples a\r\npopular movement in the city itself would force the King to take flight, so\r\nthat Garibaldi on his arrival would find the machinery of government, as\r\nwell as the command of the fleet and the army, already in the hands of\r\nVictor Emmanuel's representatives. If war with Austria was really\r\nimpending, incalculable mischief might be caused by the existence of a\r\nsemi-independent Government at Naples, reckless, in its enthusiasm for the\r\nmarch on Rome, of the effect which its acts might produce on the French\r\nalliance. In any case the control of Italian affairs could but half belong\r\nto the King and his Minister if Garibaldi, in the full glory of his\r\nunparalleled exploits, should add the Dictatorship of Naples to the\r\nDictatorship of Sicily. Accordingly Cavour plied every art to accelerate\r\nthe inevitable revolution. Persano and the Sardinian ambassador,\r\nVillamarina, had their confederates in the Bourbon Ministry and in the\r\nRoyal Family itself. But their efforts to drive King Francis from Naples,\r\nand to establish the authority of Victor Emmanuel before Garibaldi's\r\narrival, were baffled partly by the tenacity of the King and Queen, partly\r\nby the opposition of the committees of the Party of Action, who were\r\ndetermined that power should fall into no hands but those of Garibaldi\r\nhimself. It was not till Garibaldi had reached Salerno, and the Bourbon\r\ngenerals had one after another declined to undertake the responsibility of\r\ncommand in a battle against him, that Francis resolved on flight. It was\r\nnow feared that he might induce the fleet to sail with him, and even that\r\nhe might hand it over to the Austrians. The crews, it was believed, were\r\nwilling to follow the King; the officers, though inclined to the Italian\r\ncause, would be powerless to prevent them. There was not an hour to lose.\r\nOn the night of September 5th, after the King's intention to quit the\r\ncapital had become known, Persano and Villamarina disguised themselves, and\r\nin company with their partisans mingled with the crews of the fleet, whom\r\nthey induced by bribes and persuasion to empty the boilers and to cripple\r\nthe engines of their ships. When, on the 6th, King Francis, having\r\nannounced his intention to spare the capital bloodshed, went on board a\r\nmail steamer and quitted the harbour, accompanied by the ambassadors of\r\nAustria, Prussia, and Spain, only one vessel of the fleet of followed him.\r\nAn urgent summons was sent to Garibaldi, whose presence was now desired by\r\nall parties alike in order to prevent the outbreak of disorders. Leaving\r\nhis troops at Salerno, Garibaldi came by railroad to Naples on the morning\r\nof the 7th, escorted only by some of his staff. The forts were still\r\ngarrisoned by eight thousand of the Bourbon troops, but all idea of\r\nresistance had been abandoned, and Garibaldi drove fearlessly through the\r\ncity in the midst of joyous crowds. His first act as Dictator was to\r\ndeclare the ships of war belonging to the State of the Two Sicilies united\r\nto those of King Victor Emmanuel under Admiral Persano's command. Before\r\nsunset the flag of Italy was hoisted by the Neapolitan fleet. The army was\r\nnot to be so easily incorporated with the national forces. King Francis,\r\nafter abandoning the idea of a battle between Naples and Salerno, had\r\nordered the mass of his troops to retire upon Capua in order to make a\r\nfinal struggle on the line of the Volturno, and this order had been obeyed.\r\n[500]\r\n\r\n[The Piedmontese army enters Umbria and the Marches. Sept. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Fall of Ancona, Sept. 25.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as it had become evident that the entry of Garibaldi into Naples\r\ncould not be anticipated by the establishment of Victor Emmanuel's own\r\nauthority, Cavour recognised that bold and aggressive action on the part of\r\nthe National Government was now necessity. Garibaldi made no secret or his\r\nintention to carry the Italian arms to Rome. The time was past when the\r\nnational movement could be checked at the frontiers of Naples and Tuscany.\r\nIt remained only for Cavour to throw the King's own troops into the Papal\r\nStates before Garibaldi could move from Naples, and, while winning for\r\nItaly the last foot of ground that could be won without an actual conflict\r\nwith France, to stop short at those limits where the soldiers of Napoleon\r\nwould certainly meet an invader with their fire. The Pope was still in\r\npossession of the Marches, of Umbria, and of the territory between the\r\nApennines and the coast from Orvieto to Terracina. Cavour had good reason\r\nto believe that Napoleon would not strike on behalf of the Temporal Power\r\nuntil this last narrow district was menaced. He resolved to seize upon the\r\nMarches and Umbria, and to brave the consequences. On the day of\r\nGaribaldi's entry into Naples a despatch was sent by Cavour to the Papal\r\nGovernment requiring, in the name of Victor Emmanuel, the disbandment of\r\nthe foreign mercenaries who in the previous spring had plundered Perugia,\r\nand whose presence was a continued menace to the peace of Italy. The\r\nannouncement now made by Napoleon that he must break off diplomatic\r\nrelations with the Sardinian Government in case of the invasion of the\r\nPapal States produced no effect. Cavour replied that by no other means\r\ncould he prevent revolution from mastering all Italy, and on the 10th of\r\nSeptember the French ambassador quitted Turin. Without waiting for\r\nAntonelli's answer to his ultimatum, Cavour ordered the King's troops to\r\ncross the frontier. The Papal army was commanded by Lamoricière, a French\r\ngeneral who had gained some reputation in Algiers; but the resistance\r\noffered to the Piedmontese was unexpectedly feeble. The column which\r\nentered Umbria reached the southern limit without encountering any serious\r\nopposition except from the Irish garrison of Spoleto. In the Marches, where\r\nLamoricière had a considerable force at his disposal, the dispersion of the\r\nPapal troops and the incapacity shown in their command brought the campaign\r\nto a rapid and inglorious end. The main body of the defenders was routed on\r\nthe Musone, near Loreto, on the 19th of September. Other divisions\r\nsurrendered, and Ancona alone remained to Lamoricière. Vigorously attacked\r\nin this fortress both by land and sea, Lamoricière surrendered after a\r\nsiege of eight days. Within three weeks from Garibaldi's entry into Naples\r\nthe Piedmontese army had completed the task imposed upon it, and Victor\r\nEmmanuel was master of Italy as far as the Abruzzi.\r\n\r\n[Cavour, Garibaldi, and the Party of Action.]\r\n\r\nCavour's successes had not come a day too soon, for Garibaldi, since his\r\nentry into Naples, was falling more and more into the hands of the Party of\r\nAction, and, while protesting his loyalty to Victor Emmanuel, was openly\r\nannouncing that he would march the Party of on Rome whether the King's\r\nGovernment permitted it or no. In Sicily the officials appointed by this\r\nParty were proceeding with such violence that Depretis, unable to obtain\r\ntroops from Cavour, resigned his post. Garibaldi suddenly appeared at\r\nPalermo on the 11th of September, appointed a new Pro-Dictator, and\r\nrepeated to the Sicilians that their union with the Kingdom of Victor\r\nEmmanuel must be postponed until all members of the Italian family were\r\nfree. But even the personal presence and the angry words of Garibaldi were\r\npowerless to check the strong expression of Sicilian opinion in favour of\r\nimmediate and unconditional annexation. His visit to Palermo was answered\r\nby the appearance of a Sicilian deputation at Turin demanding immediate\r\nunion, and complaining that the island was treated by Garibaldi's officers\r\nlike a conquered province. At Naples the rash and violent utterances of the\r\nDictator were equally condemned. The Ministers whom he had himself\r\nappointed resigned. Garibaldi replaced them by others who were almost\r\nRepublicans, and sent a letter to Victor Emmanuel requesting him to consent\r\nto the march upon Rome and to dismiss Cavour. It was known in Turin that at\r\nthis very moment Napoleon was taking steps to increase the French force in\r\nRome, and to garrison the whole of the territory that still remained to the\r\nPope. Victor Emmanuel understood how to reply to Garibaldi's letter. He\r\nremained true to his Minister, and sent orders to Villamarina at Naples in\r\ncase Garibaldi should proclaim the Republic to break off all relations with\r\nhim and to secure the fleet. The fall of Ancona on September 28th brought a\r\ntimely accession of popularity and credit to Cavour. He made the Parliament\r\nwhich assembled at Turin four days later arbiter in the struggle between\r\nGaribaldi and himself, and received from it an almost unanimous vote of\r\nconfidence. Garibaldi would perhaps have treated lightly any resolution of\r\nParliament which conflicted with his own opinion: he shrank from a breach\r\nwith the soldier of Novara and Solferino. Now, as at other moments of\r\ndanger, the character and reputation of Victor Emmanuel stood Italy in good\r\nstead. In the enthusiasm which Garibaldi's services to Italy excited in\r\nevery patriotic heart, there was room for thankfulness that Italy possessed\r\na sovereign and a statesman strong enough even to withstand its hero when\r\nhis heroism endangered the national cause. [501]\r\n\r\n[The armies on the Volturno.]\r\n\r\n[Meeting of Victor Emmanuel and Garibaldi, Oct. 26.]\r\n\r\n[Fall of Gaeta, Feb. 14, 1861.]\r\n\r\nThe King of Naples had not yet abandoned the hope that one or more of the\r\nEuropean Powers would intervene in his behalf. The trustworthy part of his\r\narmy had gathered round the fortress of Capua on the Volturno, and there\r\nwere indications that Garibaldi would here meet with far more serious\r\nresistance than he had yet encountered. While he was still in Naples, his\r\ntroops, which had pushed northwards, sustained a repulse at Cajazzo.\r\nEmboldened by this success, the Neapolitan army at the beginning of October\r\nassumed the offensive. It was with difficulty that Garibaldi, placing\r\nhimself again at the head of his forces, drove the enemy back to Capua. But\r\nthe arms of Victor Emmanuel were now thrown into the scale. Crossing the\r\nApennines, and driving before him the weak force that was intended to bar\r\nhis way at Isernia, the King descended in the rear of the Neapolitan army.\r\nThe Bourbon commander, warned of his approach, moved northwards on the line\r\nof the Garigliano, leaving a garrison to defend Capua. Garibaldi followed\r\non his track, and in the neighbourhood of Teano met King Victor Emmanuel\r\n(October 26th). The meeting is said to have been cordial on the part of the\r\nKing, reserved on the part of Garibaldi, who saw in the King's suite the\r\nmen by whom he had been prevented from invading the Papal States in the\r\nprevious year. In spite of their common patriotism the volunteers of\r\nGaribaldi and the army of Victor Emmanuel were rival bodies, and the\r\nrelations between the chiefs of each camp were strained and difficult.\r\nGaribaldi himself returned to the siege of Capua, while the King marched\r\nnorthwards against the retreating Neapolitans. All that was great in\r\nGaribaldi's career was now in fact accomplished. The politicians about him\r\nhad attempted at Naples, as in Sicily, to postpone the union with Victor\r\nEmmanuel's monarchy, and to convoke a Southern Parliament which should fix\r\nthe conditions on which annexation would be permitted; but, after\r\ndiscrediting the General, they had been crushed by public opinion, and a\r\npopular vote which was taken at the end of October on the question of\r\nimmediate union showed the majority in favour of this course to be\r\noverwhelming. After the surrender of Capua on the 2nd of November, Victor\r\nEmmanuel made his entry into Naples. Garibaldi, whose request for the\r\nLieutenancy of Southern Italy for the space of a year with full powers was\r\nrefused by the King, [502] declined all minor honours and rewards, and\r\ndeparted to his home, still filled with resentment against Cavour, and\r\npromising his soldiers that he would return in the spring and lead them to\r\nRome and Venice. The reduction of Gaeta, where King Francis II. had taken\r\nrefuge, and of the citadel of Messina, formed the last act of the war. The\r\nFrench fleet for some time prevented the Sardinians from operating against\r\nGaeta from the sea, and the siege in consequence made slow progress. It was\r\nnot until the middle of January, 1861, that Napoleon permitted the French\r\nadmiral to quit his station. The bombardment was now opened both by land\r\nand sea, and after a brave resistance Gaeta surrendered on the 14th of\r\nFebruary. King Francis and his young Queen, a sister of the Empress of\r\nAustria, were conveyed in a French steamer to the Papal States, and there\r\nbegan their life-long exile. The citadel of Messina, commanded by one of\r\nthe few Neapolitan officers who showed any soldierly spirit, maintained its\r\nobstinate defence for a month after the Bourbon flag had disappeared from\r\nthe mainland.\r\n\r\n[Cavour's policy with regard to Rome and Venice.]\r\n\r\n[The Free Church in the Free State.]\r\n\r\nThus in the spring of 1861, within two years from the outbreak of war with\r\nAustria, Italy with the exception of Rome and Venice was united under\r\nVictor Emmanuel. Of all the European Powers, Great Britain alone watched\r\nthe creation of the new Italian Kingdom with complete sympathy and\r\napproval. Austria, though it had made peace at Zürich, declined to renew\r\ndiplomatic intercourse with Sardinia, and protested against the assumption\r\nby Victor Emmanuel of the title of King of Italy. Russia, the ancient\r\npatron of the Neapolitan Bourbons, declared that geographical conditions\r\nalone prevented its intervention against their despoilers. Prussia, though\r\nunder a new sovereign, had not yet completely severed the ties which bound\r\nit to Austria. Nevertheless, in spite of wide political ill-will, and of\r\nthe passionate hostility of the clerical party throughout Europe, there was\r\nlittle probability that the work of the Italian people would be overthrown\r\nby external force. The problem which faced Victor Emmanuel's Government was\r\nnot so much the frustration of reactionary designs from without as the\r\ndetermination of the true line of policy to be followed in regard to Rome\r\nand Venice. There were few who, like Azeglio, held that Rome might be\r\npermanently left outside the Italian Kingdom; there were none who held this\r\nof Venice. Garibaldi might be mad enough to hope for victory in a campaign\r\nagainst Austria and against France at the head of such a troop as he\r\nhimself could muster; Cavour would have deserved ill of his country if he\r\nhad for one moment countenanced the belief that the force which had\r\noverthrown the Neapolitan Bourbons could with success, or with impunity to\r\nItaly, measure itself against the defenders of Venetia or of Rome. Yet the\r\nmind of Cavour was not one which could rest in mere passive expectancy as\r\nto the future, or in mere condemnation of the unwise schemes of others. His\r\nintelligence, so luminous, so penetrating, that in its utterances we seem\r\nat times to be listening to the very spirit of the age, ranged over wide\r\nfields of moral and of spiritual interests in its forecast of the future of\r\nItaly, and spent its last force in one of those prophetic delineations\r\nwhose breadth and power the world can feel, though a later time alone can\r\njudge of their correspondence with the destined course of history. Venice\r\nwas less to Europe than Rome; its transfer to Italy would, Cavour believed,\r\nbe effected either by arms or negotiations so soon as the German race\r\nshould find a really national Government, and refuse the service which had\r\nhitherto been exacted from it for the maintenance of Austrian interests. It\r\nwas to Prussia, as the representative of nationality in Germany, that\r\nCavour looked as the natural ally of Italy in the vindication of that part\r\nof the national inheritance which still lay under the dominion of the\r\nHapsburg. Rome, unlike Venice, was not only defended by foreign arms, it\r\nwas the seat of a Power whose empire over the mind of man was not the sport\r\nof military or political vicissitudes. Circumstances might cause France to\r\nrelax its grasp on Rome, but it was not to such an accident that Cavour\r\nlooked for the incorporation of Rome with Italy. He conceived that the time\r\nwould arrive when the Catholic world would recognise that the Church would\r\nbest fulfil its task in complete separation from temporal power. Rome would\r\nthen assume its natural position as the centre of the Italian State; the\r\nChurch would be the noblest friend, not the misjudging enemy, of the\r\nItalian national monarchy. Cavour's own religious beliefs were perhaps less\r\nsimple than he chose to represent them. Occupying himself, however, with\r\ninstitutions, not with dogmas, he regarded the Church in profound\r\nearnestness as a humanising and elevating power. He valued its independence\r\nso highly that even on the suppression of the Piedmontese monasteries he\r\nhad refused to give to the State the administration of the revenue arising\r\nfrom the sale of their lands, and had formed this into a fund belonging to\r\nthe Church itself, in order that the clergy might not become salaried\r\nofficers of the State. Human freedom was the principle in which he trusted;\r\nand looking upon the Church as the greatest association formed by men, he\r\nbelieved that here too the rule of freedom, of the absence of\r\nState-regulation, would in the end best serve man's highest interests. With\r\nthe passing away of the Pope's temporal power, Cavour imagined that the\r\nconstitution of the Church itself would become more democratic, more\r\nresponsive to the movement of the modern world. His own effort in\r\necclesiastical reform had been to improve the condition and to promote the\r\nindependence of the lower clergy. He had hoped that each step in their\r\nmoral and material progress would make them more national at heart; and\r\nthough this hope had been but partially fulfilled, Cavour had never ceased\r\nto cherish the ideal of a national Church which, while recognising its Head\r\nin Rome, should cordially and without reserve accept the friendship of the\r\nItalian State. [503]\r\n\r\n[Death of Cavour, June 6, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Free Church in Free State.]\r\n\r\nIt was in the exposition of these principles, in the enforcement of the\r\ncommon moral interest of Italian nationality and the Catholic Church, that\r\nCavour gave his last counsels to the Italian Parliament. He was not himself\r\nto lead the nation farther towards the Promised Land. The immense exertions\r\nwhich he had maintained during the last three years, the indignation and\r\nanxiety caused to him by Garibaldi's attacks, produced an illness which\r\nCavour's own careless habits of life and the unskilfulness of his doctors\r\nrendered fatal. With dying lips he repeated to those about him the words in\r\nwhich he had summed up his policy in the Italian Parliament: \"A free Church\r\nin a free State.\" [504] Other Catholic lands had adjusted by Concordats\r\nwith the Papacy the conflicting claims of temporal and spiritual authority\r\nin such matters as the appointment of bishops, the regulation of schools,\r\nthe family-rights of persons married without ecclesiastical form. Cavour\r\nappears to have thought that in Italy, where the whole nation was in a\r\nsense Catholic, the Church might as safely and as easily be left to manage\r\nits own affairs as in the United States, where the Catholic community is\r\nonly one among many religious societies. His optimism, his sanguine and\r\nlarge-hearted tolerance, was never more strikingly shown than in this\r\nfidelity to the principle of liberty, even in the case of those who for the\r\ntime declined all reconciliation with the Italian State. Whether Cavour's\r\nideal was an impracticable fancy a later age will decide. The ascendency\r\nwithin the Church of Rome would seem as yet to have rested with the\r\nelements most opposed to the spirit of the time, most obstinately bent on\r\nsetting faith and reason in irreconcilable enmity. In place of that\r\ndemocratic movement within the hierarchy and the priesthood which Cavour\r\nanticipated, absolutism has won a new crown in the doctrine of Papal\r\nInfallibility. Catholic dogma has remained impervious to the solvents which\r\nduring the last thirty years have operated with perceptible success on the\r\ntheology of Protestant lands. Each conquest made in the world of thought\r\nand knowledge is still noted as the next appropriate object of denunciation\r\nby the Vatican. Nevertheless the cautious spirit will be slow to conclude\r\nthat hopes like those of Cavour were wholly vain. A single generation may\r\nsee but little of the seed-time, nothing of the harvests that are yet to\r\nenrich mankind. And even if all wider interests be left out of view, enough\r\nremains to justify Cavour's policy of respect for the independence of the\r\nChurch in the fact that Italy during the thirty years succeeding the\r\nestablishment of its union has remained free from civil war. Cavour was\r\nwont to refer to the Constitution which the French National Assembly\r\nimposed upon the clergy in 1790 as the type of erroneous legislation. Had\r\nhis own policy and that of his successors not been animated by a wiser\r\nspirit; had the Government of Italy, after overthrowing the Pope's temporal\r\nsovereignty, sought enemies among the rural priesthood and their\r\ncongregations, the provinces added to the Italian Kingdom by Garibaldi\r\nwould hardly have been maintained by the House of Savoy without a second\r\nand severer struggle. Between the ideal Italy which filled the thoughts not\r\nonly of Mazzini but of some of the best English minds of that time--the\r\nland of immemorial greatness, touched once more by the divine hand and\r\nadvancing from strength to strength as the intellectual and moral pioneer\r\namong nations--between this ideal and the somewhat hard and commonplace\r\nrealities of the Italy of to-day there is indeed little enough resemblance.\r\nPoverty, the pressure of inordinate taxation, the physical and moral habits\r\ninherited from centuries of evil government,--all these have darkened in no\r\ncommon measure the conditions from which Italian national life has to be\r\nbuilt up. If in spite of overwhelming difficulties each crisis has hitherto\r\nbeen surmounted; if, with all that is faulty and infirm, the omens for the\r\nfuture of Italy are still favourable, one source of its good fortune has\r\nbeen the impress given to its ecclesiastical policy by the great statesman\r\nto whom above all other men it owes the accomplishment of its union, and\r\nwho, while claiming for Italy the whole of its national inheritance, yet\r\ndetermined to inflict no needless wound upon the conscience of Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nGermany after 1858--The Regency in Prussia--Army re-organisation--King\r\nWilliam I.--Conflict between the Crown and the Parliament--Bismarck--The\r\nstruggle continued--Austria from 1859--The October Diploma--Resistance of\r\nHungary--The Reichsrath--Russia under Alexander II.--Liberation of the\r\nSerfs--Poland--The Insurrection of 1863--Agrarian measures in\r\nPoland--Schleswig-Holstein--Death of Frederick VII.--Plans of\r\nBismarck--Campaign in Schleswig--Conference of London--Treaty of\r\nVienna--England and Napoleon III.--Prussia and Austria--Convention of\r\nGastein--Italy--Alliance of Prussia with Italy--Proposals for a Congress\r\nfail--War between Austria and Prussia--Napoleon III.--Königgrätz--\r\nCustozza-Mediation of Napoleon--Treaty of Prague--South Germany--Projects\r\nfor compensation to France--Austria and Hungary--Deák--Establishment of\r\nthe Dual System in Austria-Hungary.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Germany from 1858.]\r\n\r\n[The Regency in Prussia, Oct. 1858.]\r\n\r\nShortly before the events which broke the power of Austria in Italy, the\r\nGerman people believed themselves to have entered on a new political era.\r\nKing Frederick William IV., who, since 1848, had disappointed every hope\r\nthat had been fixed on Prussia and on himself, was compelled by mental\r\ndisorder to withdraw from public affairs in the autumn of 1858. His\r\nbrother, Prince William of Prussia, who had for a year acted as the King's\r\nrepresentative, now assumed the Regency. In the days when King Frederick\r\nWilliam still retained some vestiges of his reputation the Prince of\r\nPrussia had been unpopular, as the supposed head of the reactionary party;\r\nbut the events of the last few years had exhibited him in a better aspect.\r\nThough strong in his belief both in the Divine right of kings in general,\r\nand in the necessity of a powerful monarchical rule in Prussia, he was\r\ndisposed to tolerate, and even to treat with a certain respect, the humble\r\nelements of constitutional government which he found in existence. There\r\nwas more manliness in his nature than in that of his brother, more belief\r\nin the worth of his own people. The espionage, the servility, the overdone\r\nprofessions of sanctity in Manteuffel's régime displeased him, but most of\r\nall he despised its pusillanimity in the conduct of foreign affairs. His\r\nheart indeed was Prussian, not German, and the destiny which created him\r\nthe first Emperor of united Germany was not of his own making nor of his\r\nown seeking; but he felt that Prussia ought to hold a far greater station\r\nboth in Germany and in Europe than it had held during his brother's reign,\r\nand that the elevation of the State to the position which it ought to\r\noccupy was the task that lay before himself. During the twelve months\r\npreceding the Regency the retirement of the King had not been treated as\r\nmore than temporary, and the Prince of Prussia, though constantly at\r\nvariance with Manteuffel's Cabinet, had therefore not considered himself at\r\nliberty to remove his brother's advisers. His first act on the assumption\r\nof the constitutional office of Regent was to dismiss the hated Ministry.\r\nPrince Antony of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen was called to office, and posts\r\nin the Government were given to men well known as moderate Liberals. Though\r\nthe Regent stated in clear terms that he had no intention of forming a\r\nLiberal party-administration, his action satisfied public opinion. The\r\ntroubles and the failures of 1849 had inclined men to be content with far\r\nless than had been asked years before. The leaders of the more advanced\r\nsections among the Liberals preferred for the most part to remain outside\r\nParliamentary life rather than to cause embarrassment to the new\r\nGovernment; and the elections of 1859 sent to Berlin a body of\r\nrepresentatives fully disposed to work with the Regent and his Ministers in\r\nthe policy of guarded progress which they had laid down.\r\n\r\n[Revival of idea of German union.]\r\n\r\nThis change of spirit in the Prussian Government, followed by the events\r\nthat established Italian independence, told powerfully upon public opinion\r\nthroughout Germany. Hopes that had been crushed in 1849 now revived. With\r\nthe collapse of military despotism in the Austrian Empire the clouds of\r\nreaction seemed everywhere to be passing away; it was possible once more to\r\nthink of German national union and of common liberties in which all Germans\r\nshould share. As in 1808 the rising of the Spaniards against Napoleon had\r\ninspired Blücher and his countrymen with the design of a truly national\r\neffort against their foreign oppressor, so in 1859 the work of Cavour\r\nchallenged the Germans to prove that their national patriotism and their\r\npolitical aptitude were not inferior to those of the Italian people. Men\r\nwho had been prominent in the National Assembly at Frankfort again met one\r\nanother and spoke to the nation. In the Parliaments of several of the minor\r\nStates resolutions were brought forward in favour of the creation of a\r\ncentral German authority. Protests were made against the infringement of\r\nconstitutional rights that had been common during the last ten years;\r\npatriotic meetings and demonstrations were held; and a National Society, in\r\nimitation of that which had prepared the way for union with Piedmont in\r\nCentral and Southern Italy, was formally established. There was indeed no\r\nsuch preponderating opinion in favour of Prussian leadership as had existed\r\nin 1848. The southern States had displayed a strong sympathy with Austria\r\nin its war with Napoleon III., and had regarded the neutrality of Prussia\r\nduring the Italian campaign as a desertion of the German cause. Here there\r\nwere few who looked with friendly eye upon Berlin. It was in the minor\r\nstates of the north, and especially in Hesse-Cassel, where the struggle\r\nbetween the Elector and his subjects was once more breaking out, that the\r\nstrongest hopes were directed towards the new Prussian ruler, and the\r\nmeasures of his government were the most anxiously watched.\r\n\r\n[The Regent of Prussia and the army.]\r\n\r\n[Scheme of reorganisation.]\r\n\r\nThe Prince Regent was a soldier by profession and habit. He was born in\r\n1797, and had been present at the battle of Arcis-sur-Aube, the last fought\r\nby Napoleon against the Allies in 1814. During forty years he had served on\r\nevery commission that had been occupied with Prussian military affairs; no\r\nman better understood the military organisation of his country, no man more\r\nclearly recognised its capacities and its faults. The defective condition\r\nof the Prussian army had been the principal, though not the sole, cause of\r\nthe miserable submission to Austria at Olmütz in 1850, and of the\r\nabandonment of all claims to German leadership on the part of the Court of\r\nBerlin. The Prince would himself have risked all chances of disaster rather\r\nthan inflict upon Prussia the humiliation with which King Frederick William\r\nthen purchased peace; but Manteuffel had convinced his sovereign that the\r\narmy could not engage in a campaign against Austria without ruin. Military\r\nimpotence was the only possible justification for the policy then adopted,\r\nand the Prince determined that Prussia should not under his own rule have\r\nthe same excuse for any political shortcomings. The work of reorganisation\r\nwas indeed begun during the reign of Frederick William IV., through the\r\nenforcement of the three-years' service to which the conscript was liable\r\nby law, but which had fallen during the long period of peace to two-years'\r\nservice. The number of troops with the colours was thus largely increased,\r\nbut no addition had been made to the yearly levy, and no improvement\r\nattempted in the organisation of the Landwehr. When in 1859 the order for\r\nmobilisation was given in consequence of the Italian war, it was discovered\r\nthat the Landwehr battalions were almost useless. The members of this force\r\nwere mostly married men approaching middle life, who had been too long\r\nengaged in other pursuits to resume their military duties with readiness,\r\nand whose call to the field left their families without means of support\r\nand chargeable upon the public purse. Too much, in the judgment of the\r\nreformers of the Prussian army, was required from men past youth, not\r\nenough from youth itself. The plan of the Prince Regent was therefore to\r\nenforce in the first instance with far more stringency the law imposing the\r\nuniversal obligation to military service; and, while thus raising the\r\nannual levy from 40,000 to 60,000 men, to extend the period of service in\r\nthe Reserve, into which the young soldier passed on the completion of his\r\nthree years with the colours, from two to four years. Asserting with\r\ngreater rigour its claim to seven years in the early life of the citizen,\r\nthe State would gain, without including the Landwehr, an effective army of\r\nfour hundred thousand men, and would practically be able to dispense with\r\nthe service of those who were approaching middle life, except in cases of\r\ngreat urgency. In the execution of this reform the Government could on its\r\nown authority enforce the increased levy and the full three years' service\r\nin the standing army; for the prolongation of service in the Reserve, and\r\nfor the greater expenditure entailed by the new system, the consent of\r\nParliament was necessary.\r\n\r\n[The Prussian Parliament and the army, 1859-1861.]\r\n\r\n[Accession of King William, Jan., 1861.]\r\n\r\nThe general principles on which the proposed reorganisation was based were\r\naccepted by public opinion and by both Chambers of Parliament; it was,\r\nhowever, held by the Liberal leaders that the increase of expenditure\r\nmight, without impairing the efficiency of the army, be avoided by\r\nreturning to the system of two-years service with the colours, which during\r\nso long a period had been thought sufficient for the training of the\r\nsoldier. The Regent, however, was convinced that the discipline and the\r\ninstruction of three years were indispensable to the Prussian conscript,\r\nand he refused to accept the compromise suggested. The mobilisation of 1859\r\nhad given him an opportunity for forming additional battalions; and\r\nalthough the Landwehr were soon dismissed to their homes the new formation\r\nwas retained, and the place of the retiring militiamen was filled by\r\nconscripts of the year. The Lower Chamber, in voting the sum required in\r\n1860 for the increased numbers of the army, treated this arrangement as\r\ntemporary, and limited the grant to one year; in spite of this the Regent,\r\nwho on the death of his brother in January, 1861, became King of Prussia,\r\nformed the additional battalions into new regiments, and gave to these new\r\nregiments their names and colours. The year 1861 passed without bringing\r\nthe questions at issue between the Government and the Chamber of Deputies\r\nto a settlement. Public feeling, disappointed in the reserved and\r\nhesitating policy which was still followed by the Court in German affairs,\r\nstimulated too by the rapid consolidation of the Italian monarchy, which\r\nthe Prussian Government on its part had as yet declined to recognise, was\r\nbecoming impatient and resentful. It seemed as if the Court of Berlin still\r\nshrank from committing itself to the national cause. The general confidence\r\nreposed in the new ruler at his accession was passing away; and when in the\r\nsummer of 1861 the dissolution of Parliament took place, the elections\r\nresulted in the return not only of a Progressist majority, but of a\r\nmajority little inclined to submit to measures of compromise, or to shrink\r\nfrom the assertion of its full constitutional rights.\r\n\r\n[First Parliament of 1862.]\r\n\r\n[Dissolution, May, 1862.]\r\n\r\n[Second Parliament of 1862.]\r\n\r\n[Bismarck becomes Minister, Sept., 1862.]\r\n\r\nThe new Parliament assembled at the beginning of 1862. Under the impulse\r\nof public opinion, the Government was now beginning to adopt a more\r\nvigorous policy in German affairs, and to re-assert Prussia's claims to\r\nan independent leadership in defiance of the restored Diet of Frankfort.\r\nBut the conflict with the Lower Chamber was not to be averted by revived\r\nenergy abroad. The Army Bill, which was passed at once by the Upper\r\nHouse, was referred to a hostile Committee on reaching the Chamber of\r\nDeputies, and a resolution was carried insisting on the right of the\r\nrepresentatives of the people to a far more effective control over the\r\nBudget than they had hitherto exercised. The result of this vote was the\r\ndissolution of Parliament by the King, and the resignation of the\r\nMinistry, with the exception of General Roon, Minister of War, and two of\r\nthe most conservative among his colleagues. Prince Hohenlohe, President\r\nof the Upper House, became chief of the Government. There was now an open\r\nand undisguised conflict between the Crown and the upholders of\r\nParliamentary rights. \"King or Parliament\" was the expression in which\r\nthe newly-appointed Ministers themselves summed up the struggle. The\r\nutmost pressure was exerted by the Government in the course of the\r\nelections which followed, but in vain. The Progressist Party returned in\r\noverwhelming strength to the new Parliament; the voice of the country\r\nseemed unmistakably to condemn the policy to which the King and his\r\nadvisers were committed. After a long and sterile discussion in the\r\nBudget Committee, the debate on the Army Bill began in the Lower House on\r\nthe 11th of September. Its principal clauses were rejected by an almost\r\nunanimous vote. An attempt made by General Roon to satisfy his opponents\r\nby a partial and conditional admission of the principle of two-years'\r\nservice resulted only in increased exasperation on both sides. Hohenlohe\r\nresigned, and the King now placed in power, at the head of a Ministry of\r\nconflict, the most resolute and unflinching of all his friends, the most\r\ncontemptuous scorner of Parliamentary majorities, Herr von Bismarck. [505]\r\n\r\n[Bismarck.]\r\n\r\nThe new Minister was, like Cavour, a country gentleman, and, like Cavour,\r\nhe owed his real entry into public life to the revolutionary movement of\r\n1848. He had indeed held some obscure official posts before that epoch, but\r\nit was as a member of the United Diet which assembled at Berlin in April,\r\n1848, that he first attracted the attention of King or people. He was one\r\nof two Deputies who refused to join in the vote of thanks to Frederick\r\nWilliam IV. for the Constitution which he had promised to Prussia.\r\nBismarck, then thirty-three years old, was a Royalist of Royalists, the\r\ntype, as it seemed, of the rough and masterful Junker, or Squire, of the\r\nolder parts of Prussia, to whom all reforms from those of Stein downwards\r\nwere hateful, all ideas but those of the barrack and the kennel alien.\r\nOthers in the spring of 1848 lamented the concessions made by the Crown to\r\nthe people; Bismarck had the courage to say so. When reaction came there\r\nwere naturally many, and among them King Frederick William, who were\r\ninterested in the man who in the heyday of constitutional enthusiasm had\r\ntreated the whole movement as so much midsummer madness, and had remained\r\nfaithful to monarchical authority as the one thing needful for the Prussian\r\nState. Bismarck continued to take a prominent part in the Parliaments of\r\nBerlin and Erfurt; it was not, however, till 1851 that he passed into the\r\ninner official circle. He was then sent as the representative of Prussia to\r\nthe restored Diet of Frankfort. As an absolutist and a conservative,\r\nbrought up in the traditions of the Holy Alliance, Bismarck had in earlier\r\ndays looked up to Austria as the mainstay of monarchical order and the\r\nhistoric barrier against the flood of democratic and wind-driven sentiment\r\nwhich threatened to deluge Germany. He had even approved the surrender made\r\nat Olmütz in 1850, as a matter of necessity; but the belief now grew strong\r\nin his mind, and was confirmed by all he saw at Frankfort, that Austria\r\nunder Schwarzenberg's rule was no longer the Power which had been content\r\nto share the German leadership with Prussia in the period before 1848, but\r\na Power which meant to rule in Germany uncontrolled. In contact with the\r\nrepresentatives of that outworn system which Austria had resuscitated at\r\nFrankfort, and with the instruments of the dominant State itself, Bismarck\r\nsoon learnt to detest the paltriness of the one and the insolence of the\r\nother. He declared the so-called Federal system to be a mere device for\r\nemploying the secondary German States for the aggrandisement of Austria and\r\nthe humiliation of Prussia. The Court of Vienna, and with it the Diet of\r\nFrankfort, became in his eyes the enemy of Prussian greatness and\r\nindependence. During the Crimean war he was the vigorous opponent of an\r\nalliance with the Western Powers, not only from distrust of France, and\r\nfrom regard towards Russia as on the whole the most constant and the most\r\nnatural ally of his own country, but from the conviction that Prussia ought\r\nto assert a national policy wholly independent of that of the Court of\r\nVienna. That the Emperor of Austria was approaching more or less nearly to\r\nunion with France and England was, in Bismarck's view, a good reason why\r\nPrussia should stand fast in its relations of friendship with St.\r\nPetersburg. [506] The policy of neutrality, which King Frederick William\r\nand Manteuffel adopted more out of disinclination to strenuous action than\r\nfrom any clear political view, was advocated by Bismarck for reasons which,\r\nif they made Europe nothing and Prussia everything, were at least inspired\r\nby a keen and accurate perception of Prussia's own interests in its present\r\nand future relations with its neighbours. When the reign of Frederick\r\nWilliam ended, Bismarck, who stood high in the confidence of the new\r\nRegent, was sent as ambassador to St. Petersburg. He subsequently\r\nrepresented Prussia for a short time at the Court of Napoleon III., and was\r\nrecalled by the King from Paris in the autumn of 1862 in order to be placed\r\nat the head of the Government. Far better versed in diplomacy than in\r\nordinary administration, he assumed, together with the Presidency of the\r\nCabinet, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\n[Bismarck and the Lower Chamber, 1862.]\r\n\r\nThere were now at the head of the Prussian State three men eminently suited\r\nto work with one another, and to carry out, in their own rough and military\r\nfashion, the policy which was to unite Germany under the House of\r\nHohenzollern. The King, Bismarck, and Roon were thoroughly at one in their\r\naim, the enforcement of Prussia's ascendency by means of the army. The\r\ndesigns of the Minister, which expanded with success and which involved a\r\ncertain daring in the choice of means, were at each new development so ably\r\nveiled or disclosed, so dexterously presented to the sovereign, as to\r\novercome his hesitation on striking into many an unaccustomed path. Roon\r\nand his workmen, who, in the face of a hostile Parliament and a hostile\r\nPress, had to supply to Bismarck what a foreign alliance and enthusiastic\r\nnational sentiment had supplied to Cavour, forged for Prussia a weapon of\r\nsuch temper that, against the enemies on whom it was employed, no\r\nextraordinary genius was necessary to render its thrust fatal. It was no\r\ndoubt difficult for the Prime Minister, without alarming his sovereign and\r\nwithout risk of an immediate breach with Austria, to make his ulterior aims\r\nso clear as to carry the Parliament with him in the policy of military\r\nreorganisation. Words frank even to brutality were uttered by him, but they\r\nsounded more like menace and bluster than the explanation of a\r\nwell-considered plan. \"Prussia must keep its forces together,\" he said in\r\none of his first Parliamentary appearances, \"its boundaries are not those\r\nof a sound State. The great questions of the time are to be decided not by\r\nspeeches and votes of majorities but by blood and iron.\" After the\r\nexperience of 1848 and 1850, a not too despondent political observer might\r\nwell have formed the conclusion that nothing less than the military\r\noverthrow of Austria could give to Germany any tolerable system of national\r\ngovernment, or even secure to Prussia its legitimate field of action. This\r\nwas the keystone of Bismarck's belief, but he failed to make his purpose\r\nand his motives intelligible to the representatives of the Prussian people.\r\nHe was taken for a mere bully and absolutist of the old type. His personal\r\ncharacteristics, his arrogance, his sarcasm, his habit of banter,\r\nexasperated and inflamed. Roon was no better suited to the atmosphere of a\r\npopular assembly. Each encounter of the Ministers with the Chamber\r\nembittered the struggle and made reconciliation more difficult. The\r\nParliamentary system of Prussia seemed threatened in its very existence\r\nwhen, after the rejection by the Chamber of Deputies of the clause in the\r\nBudget providing for the cost of the army-reorganisation, this clause was\r\nrestored by the Upper House, and the Budget of the Government passed in its\r\noriginal form. By the terms of the Constitution the right of the Upper\r\nHouse in matters of taxation was limited to the approval or rejection of\r\nthe Budget sent up to it from the Chamber of Representatives. It possessed\r\nno power of amendment. Bismarck, however, had formed the theory that in the\r\nevent of a disagreement between the two Houses a situation arose for which\r\nthe Constitution had not provided, and in which therefore the Crown was\r\nstill possessed of its old absolute authority. No compromise, no\r\nnegotiation between the two Houses, was, in his view, to be desired. He was\r\nresolved to govern and to levy taxes without a Budget, and had obtained the\r\nKing's permission to close the session immediately the Upper House had\r\ngiven its vote. But before the order for prorogation could be brought down\r\nthe President of the Lower Chamber had assembled his colleagues, and the\r\nunanimous vote of those present declared the action of the Upper House null\r\nand void. In the agitation attending this trial of strength between the\r\nCrown, the Ministry and the Upper House on one side and the Representative\r\nChamber on the other the session of 1862 closed. [507]\r\n\r\n[King William.]\r\n\r\n[The conflict continued, 1863.]\r\n\r\n[Measures against the Press.]\r\n\r\nThe Deputies, returning to their constituencies, carried with them the\r\nspirit of combat, and received the most demonstrative proofs of popular\r\nsympathy and support. Representations of great earnestness were made to the\r\nKing, but they failed to shake in the slightest degree his confidence in\r\nhis Minister, or to bend his fixed resolution to carry out his military\r\nreforms to the end. The claim of Parliament to interfere with matters of\r\nmilitary organisation in Prussia touched him in his most sensitive point.\r\nHe declared that the aim of his adversaries was nothing less than the\r\nestablishment of a Parliamentary instead of a royal army. In perfect\r\nsincerity he believed that the convulsions of 1848 were on the point of\r\nbreaking out afresh. \"You mourn the conflict between the Crown and the\r\nnational representatives,\" he said to the spokesman of an important\r\nsociety; \"do I not mourn it? I sleep no single night.\" The anxiety, the\r\ndespondency of the sovereign were shared by the friends of Prussia\r\nthroughout Germany; its enemies saw with wonder that Bismarck in his\r\nstruggle with the educated Liberalism of the middle classes did not shrink\r\nfrom dalliance with the Socialist leaders and their organs. When Parliament\r\nreassembled at the beginning of 1863 the conflict was resumed with even\r\ngreater heat. The Lower Chamber carried an address to the King, which,\r\nwhile dwelling on the loyalty of the Prussian people to their chief,\r\ncharged the Ministers with violating the Constitution, and demanded their\r\ndismissal. The King refused to receive the deputation which was to present\r\nthe address, and in the written communication in which he replied to it he\r\nsharply reproved the Assembly for their errors and presumption. It was in\r\nvain that the Army Bill was again introduced. The House, while allowing the\r\nordinary military expenditure for the year, struck out the costs of the\r\nreorganisation, and declared Ministers personally answerable for the sums\r\nexpended. Each appearance of the leading members of the Cabinet now became\r\nthe signal for contumely and altercation. The decencies of debate ceased to\r\nbe observed on either side. When the President attempted to set some limit\r\nto the violence of Bismarck and Roon, and, on resistance to his authority,\r\nterminated the sitting, the Ministers declared that they would no longer\r\nappear in a Chamber where freedom of speech was denied to them. Affairs\r\ncame to a deadlock. The Chamber again appealed to the King, and insisted\r\nthat reconciliation between the Crown and the nation was impossible so long\r\nas the present Ministers remained in office. The King, now thoroughly\r\nindignant, charged the Assembly with attempting to win for itself supreme\r\npower, expressed his gratitude to his Ministers for their resistance to\r\nthis usurpation, and declared himself too confident in the loyalty of the\r\nPrussian people to be intimidated by threats. His reply was followed by the\r\nprorogation of the Assembly (May 26th). A dissolution would have been worse\r\nthan useless, for in the actual state of public opinion the Opposition\r\nwould probably have triumphed throughout the country. It only remained for\r\nBismarck to hold his ground, and, having silenced the Parliament for a\r\nwhile, to silence the Press also by the exercise of autocratic power. The\r\nConstitution authorised the King, in the absence of the Chambers, to\r\npublish enactments on matters of urgency having the force of laws. No\r\nsooner had the session been closed than an edict was issued empowering the\r\nGovernment, without resort to courts of law, to suppress any newspaper\r\nafter two warnings. An outburst of public indignation branded this return\r\nto the principles of pure despotism in Prussia; but neither King nor\r\nMinister was to be diverted by threats or by expostulations from his\r\ncourse. The Press was effectively silenced. So profound, however, was the\r\ndistrust now everywhere felt as to the future of Prussia, and so deep the\r\nresentment against the Minister in all circles where Liberal influences\r\npenetrated, that the Crown Prince himself, after in vain protesting against\r\na policy of violence which endangered his own prospective interests in the\r\nCrown, publicly expressed his disapproval of the action of Government. For\r\nthis offence he was never forgiven.\r\n\r\n[Austria from 1859.]\r\n\r\nThe course which affairs were taking at Berlin excited the more bitter\r\nregret and disappointment among all friends of Prussia as at this very time\r\nit seemed that constitutional government was being successfully established\r\nin the western part of the Austrian Empire. The centralised military\r\ndespotism with which Austria emerged from the convulsions of 1848 had been\r\nallowed ten years of undisputed sway; at the end of this time it had\r\nbrought things to such a pass that, after a campaign in which there had\r\nbeen but one great battle, and while still in possession of a vast army and\r\nan unbroken chain of fortresses, Austria stood powerless to move hand or\r\nfoot. It was not the defeat of Solferino or the cession of Lombardy that\r\nexhibited the prostration of Austria's power, but the fact that while the\r\nconditions of the Peace of Zürich were swept away, and Italy was united\r\nunder Victor Emmanuel in defiance of the engagements made by Napoleon III.\r\nat Villafranca, the Austrian Emperor was compelled to look on with folded\r\narms. To have drawn the sword again, to have fired a shot in defence of the\r\nPope's temporal power or on behalf of the vassal princes of Tuscany and\r\nModena, would have been to risk the existence of the Austrian monarchy. The\r\nState was all but bankrupt; rebellion might at any moment break out in\r\nHungary, which had already sent thousands of soldiers to the Italian camp.\r\nPeace at whatever price was necessary abroad, and at home the system of\r\ncentralised despotism could no longer exist, come what might in its place.\r\nIt was natural that the Emperor should but imperfectly understand at the\r\nfirst the extent of the concessions which it was necessary for him to make.\r\nHe determined that the Provincial Councils which Schwarzenberg had promised\r\nin 1850 should be called into existence, and that a Council of the Empire\r\n(Reichsrath), drawn in part from these, should assemble at Vienna, to\r\nadvise, though not to control, the Government in matters of finance. So\r\nurgent, however, were the needs of the exchequer, that the Emperor\r\nproceeded at once to the creation of the Central Council, and nominated its\r\nfirst members himself. (March, 1860.)\r\n\r\n[Hungary.]\r\n\r\n[Centralists and Federalists in the Council.]\r\n\r\n[The Diploma of Oct 20, 1860.]\r\n\r\nThat the Hungarian members nominated by the Emperor would decline to appear\r\nat Vienna unless some further guarantee was given for the restoration of\r\nHungarian liberty was well known. The Emperor accordingly promised to\r\nrestore the ancient county-organisation, which had filled so great a space\r\nin Hungarian history before 1848, and to take steps for assembling the\r\nHungarian Diet. This, with the repeal of an edict injurious to the\r\nProtestants, opened the way for reconciliation, and the nominated\r\nHungarians took their place in the Council, though under protest that the\r\nexisting arrangement could only be accepted as preparatory to the full\r\nrestitution of the rights of their country. The Council continued in\r\nsession during the summer of 1860. Its duties were financial; but the\r\nestablishment of financial equilibrium in Austria was inseparable from the\r\nestablishment of political stability and public confidence; and the\r\nCouncil, in its last sittings, entered on the widest constitutional\r\nproblems. The non-German members were in the majority; and while all\r\nparties alike condemned the fallen absolutism, the rival declarations of\r\npolicy submitted to the Council marked the opposition which was\r\nhenceforward to exist between the German Liberals of Austria and the\r\nvarious Nationalist or Federalist groups. The Magyars, uniting with those\r\nwho had been their bitterest enemies, declared that the ancient\r\nindependence in legislation and administration of the several countries\r\nsubject to the House of Hapsburg must be restored, each country retaining\r\nits own historical character. The German minority contended that the\r\nEmperor should bestow upon his subjects such institutions as, while based\r\non the right of self-government should secure the unity of the Empire and\r\nthe force of its central authority. All parties were for a constitutional\r\nsystem and for local liberties in one form or another; but while the\r\nMagyars and their supporters sought for nothing less than national\r\nindependence, the Germans would at the most have granted a uniform system\r\nof provincial self-government in strict subordination to a central\r\nrepresentative body drawn from the whole Empire and legislating for the\r\nwhole Empire. The decision of the Emperor was necessarily a compromise. By\r\na Diploma published on the 20th of October he promised to restore to\r\nHungary its old Constitution, and to grant wide legislative rights to the\r\nother States of the Monarchy, establishing for the transaction of affairs\r\ncommon to the whole Empire an Imperial Council, and reserving for the\r\nnon-Hungarian members of this Council a qualified right of legislation for\r\nall the Empire except Hungary. [508]\r\n\r\n[Hungary resists the establishment of a Central Council.]\r\n\r\nThe Magyars had conquered their King; and all the impetuous patriotism that\r\nhad been crushed down since the ruin of 1849 now again burst into flame.\r\nThe County Assemblies met, and elected as their officers men who had been\r\ncondemned to death in 1849 and who were living in exile; they swept away\r\nthe existing law-courts, refused the taxes, and proclaimed the legislation\r\nof 1848 again in force. Francis Joseph seemed anxious to avert a conflict,\r\nand to prove both in Hungary and in the other parts of the Empire the\r\nsincerity of his promises of reform, on which the nature of the provincial\r\nConstitutions which were published immediately after the Diploma of October\r\nhad thrown some doubt. At the instance of his Hungarian advisers he\r\ndismissed the chief of his Cabinet, and called to office Schmerling, who,\r\nin 1848, had been Prime Minister of the German National Government at\r\nFrankfort. Schmerling at once promised important changes in the provincial\r\nsystems drawn up by his predecessor, but in his dealings with Hungary he\r\nproved far less tractable than the Magyars had expected. If the Hungarians\r\nhad recovered their own constitutional forms, they still stood threatened\r\nwith the supremacy of a Central Council in all that related to themselves\r\nin common with the rest of the Empire, and against this they rebelled. But\r\nfrom the establishment of this Council of the Empire neither the Emperor\r\nnor Schmerling would recede. An edict of February 26th, 1861, while it made\r\ngood the changes promised by Schmerling in the several provincial systems,\r\nconfirmed the general provisions of the Diploma of October, and declared\r\nthat the Emperor would maintain the Constitution of his dominions as now\r\nestablished against an attack.\r\n\r\n[Conflict of Hungary with the Crown, 1861.]\r\n\r\nIn the following April the Provincial Diets met throughout the Austrian\r\nEmpire, and the Diet of the Hungarian Kingdom assembled at Pesth. The first\r\nduty of each of these bodies was to elect representatives to the Council of\r\nthe Empire which was to meet at Vienna. Neither Hungary nor Croatia,\r\nhowever, would elect such representatives, each claiming complete\r\nlegislative independence, and declining to recognise any such external\r\nauthority as it was now proposed to create. The Emperor warned the\r\nHungarian Diet against the consequences of its action; but the national\r\nspirit of the Magyars was thoroughly roused, and the County Assemblies vied\r\nwith one another in the violence of their addresses to the Sovereign. The\r\nDiet, reviving the Constitutional difficulties connected with the\r\nabdication of Ferdinand, declared that it would only negotiate for the\r\ncoronation of Francis Joseph after the establishment of a Hungarian\r\nMinistry and the restoration of Croatia and Transylvania to the Hungarian\r\nKingdom. Accepting Schmerling's contention that the ancient constitutional\r\nrights of Hungary had been extinguished by rebellion, the Emperor insisted\r\non the establishment of a Council for the whole Empire, and refused to\r\nrecede from the declarations which he had made in the edict of February.\r\nThe Diet hereupon protested, in a long and vigorous address to the King,\r\nagainst the validity of all laws made without its own concurrence, and\r\ndeclared that Francis Joseph had rendered an agreement between the King and\r\nthe nation impossible. A dissolution followed. The County Assemblies took\r\nup the national struggle. They in their turn were suppressed; their\r\nofficers were dismissed, and military rule was established throughout the\r\nland, though with explicit declarations on the part of the King that it was\r\nto last only till the legally existing Constitution could be brought into\r\npeaceful working. [509]\r\n\r\n[The Reichsrath at Vienna, May, 1861-Dec., 1862.]\r\n\r\n[Second session of the Reichsrath, 1863.]\r\n\r\n[The Reichsrath at Vienna, May, 1861-Dec., 1862.]\r\n\r\n[Second session of the Reichsrath, 1863.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Central Representative Body, now by enlargement of its\r\nfunctions and increase in the number of its members made into a Parliament\r\nof the Empire, assembled at Vienna. Its real character was necessarily\r\naltered by the absence of representatives from Hungary; and for some time\r\nthe Government seemed disposed to limit its competence to the affairs of\r\nthe Cis-Leithan provinces; but after satisfying himself that no accord with\r\nHungary was possible, the Emperor announced this fact to the Assembly, and\r\nbade it perform its part as the organ of the Empire at large, without\r\nregard to the abstention of those who did not choose to exercise their\r\nrights. The Budget for the entire Empire was accordingly submitted to the\r\nAssembly, and for the first time the expenditure of the Austrian State was\r\nlaid open to public examination and criticism. The first session of this\r\nParliament lasted, with adjournments, from May, 1861, to December, 1862. In\r\nlegislation it effected little, but its relations as a whole with the\r\nGovernment remained excellent, and its long-continued activity, unbroken by\r\npopular disturbances, did much to raise the fallen credit of the Austrian\r\nState and to win for it the regard of Germany. On the close of the session\r\nthe Provincial Diets assembled, and throughout the spring of 1863 the\r\nrivalry of the Austrian nationalities gave abundant animation to many a\r\nlocal capital. In the next summer the Reichsrath reassembled at Vienna.\r\nThough Hungary remained in a condition not far removed from rebellion, the\r\nParliamentary system of Austria was gaining in strength, and indeed, as it\r\nseemed, at the expense of Hungary itself; for the Roumanian and German\r\npopulation of Transylvania, rejoicing in the opportunity of detaching\r\nthemselves from the Magyars, now sent deputies to Vienna. While at Berlin\r\neach week that passed sharpened the antagonism between the nation and its\r\nGovernment, and made the Minister's name more odious, Austria seemed to\r\nhave successfully broken with the traditions of its past, and to be fast\r\nearning for itself an honourable place among States of the constitutional\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nOne of the reproaches brought against Bismarck by the Progressist majority\r\nin the Parliament of Berlin was that he had isolated Prussia both in\r\nGermany and in Europe. That he had roused against the Government of his\r\ncountry the public opinion of Germany was true: that he had alienated\r\nPrussia from all Europe was not the case; on the contrary, he had\r\nestablished a closer relation between the Courts of Berlin and St.\r\nPetersburg than had existed at any time since the commencement of the\r\nRegency, and had secured for Prussia a degree of confidence and goodwill on\r\nthe part of the Czar which, in the memorable years that were to follow,\r\nserved it scarcely less effectively than an armed alliance. Russia, since\r\nthe Crimean War, had seemed to be entering upon an epoch of boundless\r\nchange. The calamities with which the reign of Nicholas had closed had\r\nexcited in that narrow circle of Russian society where thought had any\r\nexistence a vehement revulsion against the sterile and unchanging system of\r\nrepression, the grinding servitude of the last thirty years. From the\r\nEmperor downwards all educated men believed not only that the system of\r\ngovernment, but that the whole order of Russian social life, must be\r\nrecast. The ferment of ideas which marks an age of revolution was in full\r\ncourse; but in what forms the new order was to be moulded, through what\r\nprocesses Russia was to be brought into its new life, no one knew. Russia\r\nwas wanting in capable statesmen; it was even more conspicuously wanting in\r\nthe class of serviceable and intelligent agents of Government of the second\r\nrank. Its monarch, Alexander II., humane and well-meaning, was irresolute\r\nand vacillating beyond the measure of ordinary men. He was not only devoid\r\nof all administrative and organising faculty himself, but so infirm of\r\npurpose that Ministers whose policy he had accepted feared to let him pass\r\nout of their sight, lest in the course of a single journey or a single\r\ninterview he should succumb to the persuasions of some rival politician. In\r\nno country in Europe was there such incoherence, such self-contradiction,\r\nsuch absence of unity of plan and purpose in government as in Russia, where\r\nall nominally depended upon a single will. Pressed and tormented by all the\r\nrival influences that beat upon the centre of a great empire, Alexander\r\nseems at times to have played off against one another as colleagues in the\r\nsame branch of Government the representatives of the most opposite schools\r\nof action, and, after assenting to the plans of one group of advisers, to\r\nhave committed the execution of these plans, by way of counterpoise, to\r\nthose who had most opposed them. But, like other weak men, he dreaded\r\nnothing so much as the reproach of weakness or inconstancy; and in the\r\ncloud of half-formed or abandoned purposes there were some few to which he\r\nresolutely adhered. The chief of these, the great achievement of his reign,\r\nwas the liberation of the serfs.\r\n\r\n[Liberation of the Serfs. March, 1861.]\r\n\r\nIt was probably owing to the outbreak of the revolution of 1848 that the\r\nserfs had not been freed by Nicholas. That sovereign had long understood\r\nthe necessity for the change, and in 1847 he had actually appointed a\r\nCommission to report on the best means of effecting it. The convulsions of\r\n1848, followed by the Hungarian and the Crimean Wars, threw the project\r\ninto the background during the remainder of Nicholas's reign; but if the\r\nbelief of the Russian people is well founded, the last injunction of the\r\ndying Czar to his successor was to emancipate the serfs throughout his\r\nempire. Alexander was little capable of grappling with so tremendous a\r\nproblem himself; in the year 1859, however, he directed a Commission to\r\nmake a complete inquiry into the subject, and to present a scheme of\r\nemancipation. The labours of the Commission extended over two years; its\r\ndiscussions were agitated, at times violent. That serfage must sooner or\r\nlater be abolished all knew; the points on which the Commission was divided\r\nwere the bestowal of land on the peasants and the regulation of the village\r\ncommunity. European history afforded abundant precedents in emancipation,\r\nand under an infinite variety of detail three types of the process of\r\nenfranchisement were clearly distinguishable from one another. Maria\r\nTheresa, in liberating the serf, had required him to continue to render a\r\nfixed amount of labour to his lord, and had given him on this condition\r\nfixity of tenure in the land he occupied; the Prussian reformers had made a\r\ndivision of the land between the peasant and the lord, and extinguished all\r\nlabour-dues; Napoleon, in enfranchising the serfs in the Duchy of Warsaw,\r\nhad simply turned them into free men, leaving the terms of their occupation\r\nof land to be settled by arrangement or free contract with their former\r\nlords. This example had been followed in the Baltic Provinces of Russia\r\nitself by Alexander I. Of the three modes of emancipation, that based on\r\nfree contract had produced the worst results for the peasant; and though\r\nmany of the Russian landowners and their representatives in the Commission\r\nprotested against a division of the land between themselves and their serfs\r\nas an act of agrarian revolution and spoliation, there were men in high\r\noffice, and some few among the proprietors, who resolutely and successfully\r\nfought for the principle of independent ownership by the peasants. The\r\nleading spirit in this great work appears to have been Nicholas Milutine,\r\nAdjunct of the Minister of the Interior, Lanskoi. Milutine, who had drawn\r\nup the Municipal Charta of St. Petersburg, was distrusted by the Czar as a\r\nrestless and uncompromising reformer. It was uncertain from day to day\r\nwhether the views of the Ministry of the Interior or those of the\r\nterritorial aristocracy would prevail; ultimately, however, under\r\ninstructions from the Palace, the Commission accepted not only the\r\nprinciple of the division of the land, but the system of communal\r\nself-government by the peasants themselves. The determination of the amount\r\nof land to be held by the peasants of a commune and of the fixed rent to be\r\npaid to the lord was left in the first instance to private agreement; but\r\nwhere such agreement was not reached, the State, through arbiters elected\r\nat local assemblies of the nobles, decided the matter itself. The rent once\r\nfixed, the State enabled the commune to redeem it by advancing a capital\r\nsum to be recouped by a quit-rent to the State extending over forty-nine\r\nyears. The Ukase of the Czar converting twenty-five millions of serfs into\r\nfree proprietors, the greatest act of legislation of modern times, was\r\nsigned on the 3rd of March, 1861, and within the next few weeks was read in\r\nevery church of the Russian Empire. It was a strange comment on the system\r\nof government in Russia that in the very month in which the edict was\r\npublished both Lanskoi and Milutine, who had been its principal authors,\r\nwere removed from their posts. The Czar feared to leave them in power to\r\nsuperintend the actual execution of the law which they had inspired. In\r\nsupporting them up to the final stage of its enactment Alexander had\r\nstruggled against misgivings of his own, and against influences of vast\r\nstrength alike at the Court, within the Government, and in the Provinces.\r\nWith the completion of the Edict of Emancipation his power of resistance\r\nwas exhausted, and its execution was committed by him to those who had been\r\nits opponents. That some of the evils which have mingled with the good in\r\nRussian enfranchisement might have been less had the Czar resolutely stood\r\nby the authors of reform and allowed them to complete their work in\r\naccordance with their own designs and convictions, is scarcely open to\r\ndoubt. [510]\r\n\r\n[Poland, 1861, 1862.]\r\n\r\nIt had been the belief of educated men in Russia that the emancipation of\r\nthe serf would be but the first of a series of great organic changes,\r\nbringing their country more nearly to the political and social level of its\r\nEuropean neighbours. This belief was not fulfilled. Work of importance was\r\ndone in the reconstruction of the judicial system of Russia, but in the\r\nother reforms expected little was accomplished. An insurrection which broke\r\nout in Poland at the beginning of 1863 diverted the energies of the\r\nGovernment from all other objects; and in the overpowering outburst of\r\nRussian patriotism and national feeling which it excited, domestic reforms,\r\nno less than the ideals of Western civilisation, lost their interest. The\r\nestablishment of Italian independence, coinciding in time with the general\r\nunsettlement and expectation of change which marked the first years of\r\nAlexander's reign, had stirred once more the ill-fated hopes of the Polish\r\nnational leaders. From the beginning of the year 1861 Warsaw was the scene\r\nof repeated tumults. The Czar was inclined, within certain limits, to a\r\npolicy of conciliation. The separate Legislature and separate army which\r\nPoland had possessed from 1815 to 1830 he was determined not to restore;\r\nbut he was willing to give Poland a large degree of administrative\r\nautonomy, to confide the principal offices in its Government to natives,\r\nand generally to relax something of that close union with Russia which had\r\nbeen enforced by Nicholas since the rebellion of 1831. But the concessions\r\nof the Czar, accompanied as they were by acts of repression and severity,\r\nwere far from satisfying the demands of Polish patriotism. It was in vain\r\nthat Alexander in the summer of 1862 sent his brother Constantine as\r\nViceroy to Warsaw, established a Polish Council of State, placed a Pole,\r\nWielopolski, at the head of the Administration, superseded all the Russian\r\ngovernors of Polish provinces by natives, and gave to the municipalities\r\nand the districts the right of electing local councils; these concessions\r\nseemed nothing, and were in fact nothing, in comparison with the national\r\nindependence which the Polish leaders claimed. The situation grew worse and\r\nworse. An attempt made upon the life of the Grand Duke Constantine during\r\nhis entry into Warsaw was but one among a series of similar acts which\r\ndiscredited the Polish cause and strengthened those who at St. Petersburg\r\nhad from the first condemned the Czar's attempts at conciliation. At length\r\nthe Russian Government took the step which precipitated revolt. A levy of\r\none in every two hundred of the population throughout the Empire had been\r\nordered in the autumn of 1862. Instructions were sent from St. Petersburg\r\nto the effect that in raising this levy in Poland the country population\r\nwere to be spared, and that all persons who were known to be connected with\r\nthe disorders in the towns were to be seized as soldiers. This terrible\r\nsentence against an entire political class was carried out, so far as it\r\nlay within the power of the authorities, on the night of January 14th,\r\n1863. But before the imperial press-gang surrounded the houses of its\r\nvictims a rumour of the intended blow had gone abroad. In the preceding\r\nhours, and during the night of the 14th, thousands fled from Warsaw and the\r\nother Polish towns into the forests. There they formed themselves into\r\narmed bands, and in the course of the next few days a guerilla warfare\r\nbroke out wherever Russian troops were found in insufficient strength or\r\noff their guard. [511]\r\n\r\n[Poland and Russia.]\r\n\r\nThe classes in which the national spirit of Poland lived were the so-called\r\nnoblesse, numbering hundreds of thousands, the town populations, and the\r\npriesthood. The peasants, crushed and degraded, though not nominally in\r\nservitude, were indifferent to the national cause. On the neutrality, if\r\nnot on the support, of the peasants the Russian Government could fairly\r\nreckon; within the towns it found itself at once confronted by an invisible\r\nnational Government whose decrees were printed and promulgated by unknown\r\nhands, and whose sentences of death were mercilessly executed against those\r\nwhom it condemned as enemies or traitors to the national cause. So\r\nextraordinary was the secrecy which covered the action of this National\r\nExecutive, that Milutine, who was subsequently sent by the Czar to examine\r\ninto the affairs of Poland, formed the conclusion that it had possessed\r\naccomplices within the Imperial Government at St. Petersburg itself. The\r\nPolish cause retained indeed some friends in Russia even after the outbreak\r\nof the insurrection; it was not until the insurrection passed the frontier\r\nof the kingdom and was carried by the nobles into Lithuania and Podolia\r\nthat the entire Russian nation took up the struggle with passionate and\r\nvindictive ardour as one for life or death. It was the fatal bane of Polish\r\nnationality that the days of its greatness had left it a claim upon vast\r\nterritories where it had planted nothing but a territorial aristocracy, and\r\nwhere the mass of population, if not actually Russian, was almost\r\nindistinguishable from the Russians in race and language, and belonged like\r\nthem to the Greek Church, which Catholic Poland had always persecuted. For\r\nninety years Lithuania and the border provinces had been incorporated with\r\nthe Czar's dominions, and with the exception of their Polish landowners\r\nthey were now in fact thoroughly Russian. When therefore the nobles of\r\nthese provinces declared that Poland must be reconstituted with the limits\r\nof 1772, and subsequently took up arms in concert with the insurrectionary\r\nGovernment at Warsaw, the Russian people, from the Czar to the peasant,\r\nfelt the struggle to be nothing less than one for the dismemberment or the\r\npreservation of their own country, and the doom of Polish nationality, at\r\nleast for some generations, was sealed. The diplomatic intervention of the\r\nWestern Powers on behalf of the constitutional rights of Poland under the\r\nTreaty of Vienna, which was to some extent supported by Austria, only\r\nprolonged a hopeless struggle, and gave unbounded popularity to Prince\r\nGortschakoff, by whom, after a show of courteous attention during the\r\nearlier and still perilous stage of the insurrection, the interference of\r\nthe Powers was resolutely and unconditionally repelled. By the spring of\r\n1864 the insurgents were crushed or exterminated. General Muravieff, the\r\nGovernor of Lithuania, fulfilled his task against the mutinous nobles of\r\nthis province with unshrinking severity, sparing neither life nor fortune\r\nso long as an enemy of Russia remained to be overthrown. It was at Wilna,\r\nthe Lithuanian capital, not at Warsaw, that the terrors of Russian\r\nrepression were the greatest. Muravieff's executions may have been less\r\nnumerous than is commonly supposed; but in the form of pecuniary\r\nrequisitions and fines he undoubtedly aimed at nothing less than the utter\r\nruin of a great part of the class most implicated in the rebellion.\r\n\r\n[Agrarian measures in Poland.]\r\n\r\n[Agrarian measures in Poland, 1864.]\r\n\r\nIn Poland itself the Czar, after some hesitation, determined once and for\r\nall to establish a friend to Russia in every homestead of the kingdom by\r\nmaking the peasant owner of the land on which he laboured. The\r\ninsurrectionary Government at the outbreak of the rebellion had attempted\r\nto win over the peasantry by promising enactments to this effect, but no\r\none had responded to their appeal. In the autumn of 1863 the Czar recalled\r\nMilutine from his enforced travels and directed him to proceed to Warsaw,\r\nin order to study the affairs of Poland on the spot, and to report on the\r\nmeasures necessary to be taken for its future government and organisation.\r\nMilutine obtained the assistance of some of the men who had laboured most\r\nearnestly with him in the enfranchisement of the Russian serfs; and in the\r\ncourse of a few weeks he returned to St. Petersburg, carrying with him the\r\ndraft of measures which were to change the face of Poland. He recommended\r\non the one hand that every political institution separating Poland from the\r\nrest of the Empire should be swept away, and the last traces of Polish\r\nindependence utterly obliterated; on the other hand, that the peasants, as\r\nthe only class on which Russia could hope to count in the future, should be\r\nmade absolute and independent owners of the land they occupied. Prince\r\nGortschakoff, who had still some regard for the opinion of Western Europe,\r\nand possibly some sympathy for the Polish aristocracy, resisted this daring\r\npolicy; but the Czar accepted Milutine's counsel, and gave him a free hand\r\nin the execution of his agrarian scheme. The division of the land between\r\nthe nobles and the peasants was accordingly carried out by Milutine's own\r\nofficers under conditions very different from those adopted in Russia. The\r\nwhole strength of the Government was thrown on to the side of the peasant\r\nand against the noble. Though the population was denser in Poland than in\r\nRussia, the peasant received on an average four times as much land; the\r\ncompensation made to the lords (which was paid in bonds which immediately\r\nfell to half their nominal value) was raised not by quit-rents on the\r\npeasants' lands alone, as in Russia, but by a general land-tax falling\r\nequally on the land left to the lords, who had thus to pay a great part of\r\ntheir own compensation: above all, the questions in dispute were settled,\r\nnot as in Russia by arbiters elected at local assemblies of the nobles, but\r\nby officers of the Crown. Moreover, the division of landed property was not\r\nmade once and for all, as in Russia, but the woods and pastures remaining\r\nto the lords continued subject to undefined common-rights of the peasants.\r\nThese common-rights were deliberately left unsettled in order that a source\r\nof contention might always be present between the greater and the lesser\r\nproprietors, and that the latter might continue to look to the Russian\r\nGovernment as the protector or extender of their interests. \"We hold\r\nPoland,\" said a Russian statesman, \"by its rights of common.\" [512]\r\n\r\n[Russia and Polish nationality.]\r\n\r\nMilutine, who, with all the fiery ardour of his national and levelling\r\npolicy, seems to have been a gentle and somewhat querulous invalid, and who\r\nwas shortly afterwards struck down by paralysis, to remain a helpless\r\nspectator of the European changes of the next six years, had no share in\r\nthat warfare against the language, the religion, and the national culture\r\nof Poland with which Russia has pursued its victory since 1863. The public\r\nlife of Poland he was determined to Russianise; its private and social life\r\nhe would probably have left unmolested, relying on the goodwill of the\r\ngreat mass of peasants who owed their proprietorship to the action of the\r\nCzar. There were, however, politicians at Moscow and St. Petersburg who\r\nbelieved that the deep-lying instinct of nationality would for the first\r\ntime be called into real life among these peasants by their very elevation\r\nfrom misery to independence, and that where Russia had hitherto had three\r\nhundred thousand enemies Milutine was preparing for it six millions. It was\r\nthe dread of this possibility in the future, the apprehension that material\r\ninterests might not permanently vanquish the subtler forces which pass from\r\ngeneration to generation, latent, if still unconscious, where nationality\r\nitself is not lost, that made the Russian Government follow up the\r\npolitical destruction of the Polish noblesse by measures directed against\r\nPolish nationality itself, even at the risk of alienating the class who for\r\nthe present were effectively won over to the Czar's cause. By the side of\r\nits life-giving and beneficent agrarian policy Russia has pursued the\r\nodious system of debarring Poland from all means of culture and improvement\r\nassociated with the use of its own language, and has aimed at eventually\r\nturning the Poles into Russians by the systematic impoverishment and\r\nextinction of all that is essentially Polish in thought, in sentiment, and\r\nin expression. The work may prove to be one not beyond its power; and no\r\ncommon perversity on the part of its Government would be necessary to turn\r\nagainst Russia the millions who in Poland owe all they have of prosperity\r\nand independence to the Czar: but should the excess of Russian\r\npropagandism, or the hostility of Church to Church, at some distant date\r\nengender a new struggle for Polish independence, this struggle will be one\r\ngoverned by other conditions than those of 1831 or 1863, and Russia will,\r\nfor the first time, have to conquer on the Vistula not a class nor a city,\r\nbut a nation.\r\n\r\n[Berlin and St. Petersburg, 1863.]\r\n\r\nIt was a matter of no small importance to Bismarck and to Prussia that in\r\nthe years 1863 and 1864 the Court of St. Petersburg found itself confronted\r\nwith affairs of such seriousness in Poland. From the opportunity which was\r\nthen presented to him of obliging an important neighbour, and of profiting\r\nby that neighbour's conjoined embarrassment and goodwill, Bismarck drew\r\nfull advantage. He had always regarded the Poles as a mere nuisance in\r\nEurope, and heartily despised the Germans for the sympathy which they had\r\nshown towards Poland in 1848. When the insurrection of 1863 broke out,\r\nBismarck set the policy of his own country in emphatic contrast with that\r\nof Austria and the Western Powers, and even entered into an arrangement\r\nwith Russia for an eventual military combination in case the insurgents\r\nshould pass from one side to the other of the frontier. [513] Throughout\r\nthe struggle with the Poles, and throughout the diplomatic conflict with\r\nthe Western Powers, the Czar had felt secure in the loyalty of the stubborn\r\nMinister at Berlin; and when, at the close of the Polish revolt, the events\r\noccurred which opened to Prussia the road to political fortune, Bismarck\r\nreceived his reward in the liberty of action given him by the Russian\r\nGovernment. The difficulties connected with Schleswig-Holstein, which,\r\nafter a short interval of tranquillity following the settlement of 1852,\r\nhad again begun to trouble Europe, were forced to the very front of\r\nContinental affairs by the death of Frederick VII., King of Denmark, in\r\nNovember, 1863. Prussia had now at its head a statesman resolved to pursue\r\nto their extreme limit the chances which this complication offered to his\r\nown country; and, more fortunate than his predecessors of 1848, Bismarck\r\nhad not to dread the interference of the Czar of Russia as the patron and\r\nprotector of the interests of the Danish court.\r\n\r\n[Schleswig-Holstein, 1852-1863.]\r\n\r\n[The Patent of March 30, 1863.]\r\n\r\nBy the Treaty of London, signed on May 8th, 1852, all the great Powers,\r\nincluding Prussia, had recognised the principle of the integrity of the\r\nDanish Monarchy, and had pronounced Prince Christian of Glücksburg to be\r\nheir-presumptive to the whole dominions of the reigning King. The rights of\r\nthe German Federation in Holstein were nevertheless declared to remain\r\nunprejudiced; and in a Convention made with Austria and Prussia before they\r\njoined in this Treaty, King Frederick VII. had undertaken to conform to\r\ncertain rules in his treatment of Schleswig as well as of Holstein. The\r\nDuke of Augustenburg, claimant to the succession in Schleswig-Holstein\r\nthrough the male line, had renounced his pretensions in consideration of an\r\nindemnity paid to him by the King of Denmark. This surrender, however, had\r\nnot received the consent of his son and of the other members of the House\r\nof Augustenburg, nor had the German Federation, as such, been a party to\r\nthe Treaty of London. Relying on the declaration of the Great Powers in\r\nfavour of the integrity of the Danish Kingdom, Frederick VII. had resumed\r\nhis attempts to assimilate Schleswig, and in some degree Holstein, to the\r\nrest of the Monarchy; and although the Provincial Estates were allowed to\r\nremain in existence, a national Constitution was established in October,\r\n1855, for the entire Danish State. Bitter complaints were made of the\r\nsystem of repression and encroachment with which the Government of\r\nCopenhagen was attempting to extinguish German nationality in the border\r\nprovinces; at length, in November, 1858, under threat of armed intervention\r\nby the German Federation, Frederick consented to exclude Holstein from the\r\noperation of the new Constitution. But this did not produce peace, for the\r\ninhabitants of Schleswig, severed from the sister-province and now excited\r\nby the Italian war, raised all the more vigorous a protest against their\r\nown incorporation with Denmark; while in Holstein itself the Government\r\nincurred the charge of unconstitutional action in fixing the Budget without\r\nthe consent of the Estates. The German Federal Diet again threatened to\r\nresort to force, and Denmark prepared for war. Prussia took up the cause of\r\nSchleswig in 1861; and even the British Government, which had hitherto\r\nshown far more interest in the integrity of Denmark than in the rights of\r\nthe German provinces, now recommended that the Constitution of 1855 should\r\nbe abolished, and that a separate legislation and administration should be\r\ngranted to Schleswig as well as to Holstein. The Danes, however, were bent\r\non preserving Schleswig as an integral part of the State, and the\r\nGovernment of King Frederick, while willing to recognise Holstein as\r\noutside Danish territory proper, insisted that Schleswig should be included\r\nwithin the unitary Constitution, and that Holstein should contribute a\r\nfixed share to the national expenditure. A manifesto to this effect,\r\npublished by King Frederick on the 30th of March, 1863, was the immediate\r\nground of the conflict now about to break out between Germany and Denmark.\r\nThe Diet of Frankfort announced that if this proclamation were not revoked\r\nit should proceed to Federal execution, that is, armed intervention,\r\nagainst the King of Denmark as Duke of Holstein. Still counting upon\r\nforeign aid or upon the impotence of the Diet, the Danish Government\r\nrefused to change its policy, and on the 29th of September laid before the\r\nParliament at Copenhagen the law incorporating Schleswig with the rest of\r\nthe Monarchy under the new Constitution. Negotiations were thus brought to\r\na close, and on the 1st of October the Diet decreed the long-threatened\r\nFederal execution. [514]\r\n\r\n[Death of Frederick VII., November, 1863.]\r\n\r\n[Federal execution in Holstein. December, 1863.]\r\n\r\nAffairs had reached this stage, and the execution had not yet been put in\r\nforce, when, on the 15th of November, King Frederick VII. died. For a\r\nmoment it appeared possible that his successor, Prince Christian of\r\nGlücksburg, might avert the conflict with Germany by withdrawing from the\r\nposition which his predecessor had taken up. But the Danish people and\r\nMinistry were little inclined to give way; the Constitution had passed\r\nthrough Parliament two days before King Frederick's death, and on the 18th\r\nof November it received the assent of the new monarch. German national\r\nfeeling was now as strongly excited on the question of Schleswig-Holstein\r\nas it had been in 1848. The general cry was that the union of these\r\nprovinces with Denmark must be treated as at an end, and their legitimate\r\nruler, Frederick of Augustenburg, son of the Duke who had renounced his\r\nrights, be placed on the throne. The Diet of Frankfort, however, decided to\r\nrecognise neither of the two rival sovereigns in Holstein until its own\r\nintervention should have taken place. Orders were given that a Saxon and a\r\nHanoverian corps should enter the country; and although Prussia and Austria\r\nhad made a secret agreement that the settlement of the Schleswig-Holstein\r\nquestion was to be conducted by themselves independently of the Diet, the\r\ntide of popular enthusiasm ran so high that for the moment the two leading\r\nPowers considered it safer not to obstruct the Federal authority, and the\r\nSaxon and Hanoverian troops accordingly entered Holstein as mandatories of\r\nthe Diet at the end of 1863. The Danish Government, offering no resistance,\r\nwithdrew its troops across the river Eider into Schleswig.\r\n\r\n[Plans of Bismarck.]\r\n\r\n[Union of Austria and Prussia.]\r\n\r\n[Austrian and Prussian troops enter Schleswig. Feb., 1864.]\r\n\r\nFrom this time the history of Germany is the history of the profound and\r\naudacious statecraft and of the overmastering will of Bismarck; the nation,\r\nexcept through its valour on the battle-field, ceases to influence the\r\nshaping of its own fortunes. What the German people desired in 1864 was\r\nthat Schleswig-Holstein should be attached, under a ruler of its own, to\r\nthe German Federation as it then existed; what Bismarck intended was that\r\nSchleswig-Holstein, itself incorporated more or less directly with Prussia,\r\nshould be made the means of the destruction of the existing Federal system\r\nand of the expulsion of Austria from Germany. That another petty State,\r\nbound to Prussia by no closer tie than its other neighbours, should be\r\nadded to the troop among whom Austria found its vassals and its\r\ninstruments, would have been in Bismarck's eyes no gain but actual\r\ndetriment to Germany. The German people desired one course of action;\r\nBismarck had determined on something totally different; and with matchless\r\nresolution and skill he bore down all opposition of people and of Courts,\r\nand forced a reluctant nation to the goal which he had himself chosen for\r\nit. The first point of conflict was the apparent recognition by Bismarck of\r\nthe rights of King Christian IX. as lawful sovereign in the Duchies as well\r\nas in the rest of the Danish State. By the Treaty of London Prussia had\r\nindeed pledged itself to this recognition; but the German Federation had\r\nbeen no party to the Treaty, and under the pressure of a vehement national\r\nagitation Bavaria and the minor States one after another recognised\r\nFrederick of Augustenburg as Duke of Schleswig-Holstein. Bismarck was\r\naccused alike by the Prussian Parliament and by the popular voice of\r\nGermany at large of betraying German interests to Denmark, of abusing\r\nPrussia's position as a Great Power, of inciting the nation to civil war.\r\nIn vain he declared that, while surrendering no iota of German rights, the\r\nGovernment of Berlin must recognise those treaty-obligations with which its\r\nown legal title to a voice in the affairs of Schleswig was intimately bound\r\nup, and that the King of Prussia, not a multitude of irresponsible and\r\nill-informed citizens, must be the judge of the measures by which German\r\ninterests were to be effectually protected. His words made no single\r\nconvert either in the Prussian Parliament or in the Federal Diet. At\r\nFrankfort the proposal made by the two leading Powers that King Christian\r\nshould be required to annul the November Constitution, and that in case of\r\nhis refusal Schleswig also should be occupied, was rejected, as involving\r\nan acknowledgment of the title of Christian as reigning sovereign. At\r\nBerlin the Lower Chamber refused the supplies which Bismarck demanded for\r\noperations in the Duchies, and formally resolved to resist his policy by\r\nevery means at its command. But the resistance of Parliament and of Diet\r\nwere alike in vain. By a masterpiece of diplomacy Bismarck had secured the\r\nsupport and co-operation of Austria in his own immediate Danish policy,\r\nthough but a few months before he had incurred the bitter hatred of the\r\nCourt of Vienna by frustrating its plans for a reorganisation of Germany by\r\na Congress of princes at Frankfort, and had frankly declared to the\r\nAustrian ambassador at Berlin that if Austria did not transfer its\r\npolitical centre to Pesth and leave to Prussia free scope in Germany, it\r\nwould find Prussia on the side of its enemies in the next war in which it\r\nmight be engaged. [515] But the democratic and impassioned character of the\r\nagitation in the minor States in favour of the Schleswig-Holsteiners and\r\ntheir Augustenburg pretender had enabled Bismarck to represent this\r\nmovement to the Austrian Government as a revolutionary one, and by a\r\ndexterous appeal to the memories of 1848 to awe the Emperor's advisers into\r\ndirect concert with the Court of Berlin, as the representative of\r\nmonarchical order, in dealing with a problem otherwise too likely to be\r\nsolved by revolutionary methods and revolutionary forces. Count Rechberg,\r\nthe Foreign Minister at Vienna, was lured into a policy which, after\r\ndrawing upon Austria a full share of the odium of Bismarck's Danish plans,\r\nafter forfeiting for it the goodwill of the minor States with which it\r\nmight have kept Prussia in check, and exposing it to the risk of a European\r\nwar, was to confer upon its rival the whole profit of the joint enterprise,\r\nand to furnish a pretext for the struggle by which Austria was to be\r\nexpelled alike from Germany and from what remained to it of Italy. But of\r\nthe nature of the toils into which he was now taking the first fatal and\r\nirrevocable step Count Rechberg appears to have had no suspicion. A seeming\r\ncordiality united the Austrian and Prussian Governments in the policy of\r\ndefiance to the will of all the rest of Germany and to the demands of their\r\nown subjects. It was to no purpose that the Federal Diet vetoed the\r\nproposed summons to King Christian and the proposed occupation of\r\nSchleswig. Austria and Prussia delivered an ultimatum at Copenhagen\r\ndemanding the repeal of the November Constitution; and on its rejection\r\ntheir troops entered Schleswig, not as the mandatories of the German\r\nFederation, but as the instruments of two independent and allied Powers.\r\n(Feb. 1, 1864.)\r\n\r\n[Campaign in Schleswig. Feb.-April, 1864.]\r\n\r\nAgainst the overwhelming forces by which they were thus attacked the Danes\r\ncould only make a brave but ineffectual resistance. Their first line of\r\ndefence was the Danewerke, a fortification extending east and west towards\r\nthe sea from the town of Schleswig. Prince Frederick Charles, who commanded\r\nthe Prussian right, was repulsed in an attack upon the easternmost part of\r\nthis work at Missunde; the Austrians, however, carried some positions in\r\nthe centre which commanded the defenders' lines, and the Danes fell back\r\nupon the fortified post of Düppel, covering the narrow channel which\r\nseparates the island of Alsen from the mainland. Here for some weeks they\r\nheld the Prussians in check, while the Austrians, continuing the march\r\nnorthwards, entered Jutland. At length, on the 18th of April, after several\r\nhours of heavy bombardment, the lines of Düppel were taken by storm and the\r\ndefenders driven across the channel into Alsen. Unable to pursue the enemy\r\nacross this narrow strip of sea, the Prussians joined their allies in\r\nJutland, and occupied the whole of the Danish mainland as far as the Lüm\r\nFiord. The war, however, was not to be terminated without an attempt on the\r\npart of the neutral Powers to arrive at a settlement by diplomacy. A\r\nConference was opened at London on the 20th of April, and after three weeks\r\nof negotiation the belligerents were induced to accept an armistice. As the\r\ntroops of the German Federation, though unconcerned in the military\r\noperations of the two Great Powers, were in possession of Holstein, the\r\nFederal Government was invited to take part in the Conference. It was\r\nrepresented by Count Beust, Prime Minister of Saxony, a politician who was\r\nsoon to rise to much greater eminence; but in consequence of the diplomatic\r\nunion of Prussia and Austria the views entertained by the Governments of\r\nthe secondary German States had now no real bearing on the course of\r\nevents, and Count Beust's earliest appearance on the great European stage\r\nwas without result, except in its influence on his own career. [516]\r\n\r\n[Conference of London. April, 1864.]\r\n\r\nThe first proposition laid before the Conference was that submitted by\r\nBernstorff, the Prussian envoy, to the effect that Schleswig-Holstein\r\nshould receive complete independence, the question whether King Christian\r\nor some other prince should be sovereign of the new State being reserved\r\nfor future settlement. To this the Danish envoys replied that even on the\r\ncondition of personal union with Denmark through the Crown they could not\r\nassent to the grant of complete independence to the Duchies. Raising their\r\ndemand in consequence of this refusal, and declaring that the war had made\r\nan end of the obligations subsisting under the London Treaty of 1852, the\r\ntwo German Powers then demanded that Schleswig-Holstein should be\r\ncompletely separated from Denmark and formed into a single State under\r\nFrederick of Augustenburg, who in the eyes of Germany possessed the best\r\nclaim to the succession. Lord Russell, while denying that the acts or\r\ndefaults of Denmark could liberate Austria and Prussia from their\r\nengagements made with other Powers in the Treaty of London, admitted that\r\nno satisfactory result was likely to arise from the continued union of the\r\nDuchies with Denmark, and suggested that King Christian should make an\r\nabsolute cession of Holstein and of the southern part of Schleswig,\r\nretaining the remainder in full sovereignty. The frontier-line he proposed\r\nto draw at the River Schlei. To this principle of partition both Denmark\r\nand the German Powers assented, but it proved impossible to reach an\r\nagreement on the frontier-line. Bernstorff, who had at first required\r\nnearly all Schleswig, abated his demands, and would have accepted a line\r\ndrawn westward from Flensburg, so leaving to Denmark at least half the\r\nprovince, including the important position of Düppel. The terms thus\r\noffered to Denmark were not unfavourable. Holstein it did not expect, and\r\ncould scarcely desire, to retain; and the territory which would have been\r\ntaken from it in Schleswig under this arrangement included few districts\r\nthat were not really German. But the Government of Copenhagen, misled by\r\nthe support given to it at the Conference by England and Russia--a support\r\nwhich was one of words only--refused to cede anything north of the town of\r\nSchleswig. Even when in the last resort Lord Russell proposed that the\r\nfrontier-line should be settled by arbitration the Danish Government held\r\nfast to its refusal, and for the sake of a few miles of territory plunged\r\nonce more into a struggle which, if it was not to kindle a European war of\r\nvast dimensions, could end only in the ruin of the Danes. The expected help\r\nfailed them. Attacked and overthrown in the island of Alsen, the German\r\nflag carried to the northern extremity of their mainland, they were\r\ncompelled to make peace on their enemies' terms. Hostilities were brought\r\nto a close by the signature of Preliminaries on the 1st of August; and by\r\nthe Treaty of Vienna, concluded on the 30th of October, 1864, King\r\nChristian ceded his rights in the whole of Schleswig-Holstein to the\r\nsovereigns of Austria and Prussia jointly, and undertook to recognise\r\nwhatever dispositions they might make of those provinces.\r\n\r\n[Great Britain and Napoleon III.]\r\n\r\nThe British Government throughout this conflict had played a sorry part, at\r\none moment threatening the Germans, at another using language towards the\r\nDanes which might well be taken to indicate an intention of lending them\r\narmed support. To some extent the errors of the Cabinet were due to the\r\nrelation which existed between Great Britain and Napoleon III. It had up to\r\nthis time been considered both at London and at Paris that the Allies of\r\nthe Crimea had still certain common interests in Europe; and in the\r\nunsuccessful intervention at St. Petersburg on behalf of Poland in 1863 the\r\nBritish and French Governments had at first gone hand in hand. But behind\r\nevery step openly taken by Napoleon III. there was some half-formed design\r\nfor promoting the interests of his dynasty or extending the frontiers of\r\nFrance; and if England had consented to support the diplomatic concert at\r\nSt. Petersburg by measures of force, it would have found itself engaged in\r\na war in which other ends than those relating to Poland would have been the\r\nforemost. Towards the close of the year 1863 Napoleon had proposed that a\r\nEuropean Congress should assemble, in order to regulate not only the\r\naffairs of Poland but all those European questions which remained\r\nunsettled. This proposal had been abruptly declined by the English\r\nGovernment; and when in the course of the Danish war Lord Palmerston showed\r\nan inclination to take up arms if France would do the same, Napoleon was\r\nprobably not sorry to have the opportunity of repaying England for its\r\nrejection of his own overtures in the previous year. He had moreover hopes\r\nof obtaining from Prussia an extension of the French frontier either in\r\nBelgium or towards the Rhine. [517] In reply to overtures from London,\r\nNapoleon stated that the cause of Schleswig-Holstein to some extent\r\nrepresented the principle of nationality, to which France was friendly, and\r\nthat of all wars in which France could engage a war with Germany would be\r\nthe least desirable. England accordingly, if it took up arms for the Danes,\r\nwould have been compelled to enter the war alone; and although at a later\r\ntime, when the war was over and the victors were about to divide the spoil,\r\nthe British and French fleets ostentatiously combined in manoeuvres at\r\nCherbourg, this show of union deceived no one, least of all the resolute\r\nand well-informed director of affairs at Berlin. To force, and force alone,\r\nwould Bismarck have yielded. Palmerston, now sinking into old age,\r\npermitted Lord Russell to parody his own fierce language of twenty years\r\nback; but all the world, except the Danes, knew that the fangs and the\r\nclaws were drawn, and that British foreign policy had become for the time a\r\nthing of snarls and grimaces.\r\n\r\n[Intentions of Bismarck as to Schleswig-Holstein.]\r\n\r\nBismarck had not at first determined actually to annex Schleswig-Holstein\r\nto Prussia. He would have been content to leave it under the nominal\r\nsovereignty of Frederick of Augustenburg if that prince would have placed\r\nthe entire military and naval resources of Schleswig-Holstein under the\r\ncontrol of the Government of Berlin, and have accepted on behalf of his\r\nDuchies conditions which Bismarck considered indispensable to German\r\nunion under Prussian leadership. In the harbour of Kiel it was not\r\ndifficult to recognise the natural headquarters of a future German fleet;\r\nthe narrow strip of land projecting between the two seas naturally\r\nsuggested the formation of a canal connecting the Baltic with the German\r\nOcean, and such a work could only belong to Germany at large or to its\r\nleading Power. Moreover, as a frontier district, Schleswig-Holstein was\r\npeculiarly exposed to foreign attack; certain strategical positions\r\nnecessary for its defence must therefore be handed over to its protector.\r\nThat Prussia should have united its forces with Austria in order to win\r\nfor the Schleswig-Holsteiners the power of governing themselves as they\r\npleased, must have seemed to Bismarck a supposition in the highest degree\r\npreposterous. He had taken up the cause of the Duchies not in the\r\ninterest of the inhabitants but in the interest of Germany; and by\r\nGermany he understood Germany centred at Berlin and ruled by the House of\r\nHohenzollern. If therefore the Augustenburg prince was not prepared to\r\naccept his throne on these terms, there was no room for him, and the\r\nprovinces must be incorporated with Prussia itself. That Austria would\r\nnot without compensation permit the Duchies thus to fall directly or\r\nindirectly under Prussian sway was of course well known to Bismarck; but\r\nso far was this from causing him any hesitation in his policy, that from\r\nthe first he had discerned in the Schleswig-Holstein question a favourable\r\npretext for the war which was to drive Austria out of Germany.\r\n\r\n[Relations of Prussia and Austria, Dec., 1854-Aug., 1865.]\r\n\r\n[Convention of Gastein, Aug. 14, 1865.]\r\n\r\nPeace with Denmark was scarcely concluded when, at the bidding of Prussia,\r\nreluctantly supported by Austria, the Saxon and Hanoverian troops which had\r\nentered Holstein as the mandatories of the Federal Diet were compelled to\r\nleave the country. A Provisional Government was established under the\r\ndirection of an Austrian and a Prussian Commissioner. Bismarck had met the\r\nPrince of Augustenburg at Berlin some months before, and had formed an\r\nunfavourable opinion of the policy likely to be adopted by him towards\r\nPrussia. All Germany, however, was in favour of the Prince's claims, and at\r\nthe Conference of London these claims had been supported by the Prussian\r\nenvoy himself. In order to give some appearance of formal legality to his\r\nown action, Bismarck had to obtain from the Crown-jurists of Prussia a\r\ndecision that King Christian IX. had, contrary to the general opinion of\r\nGermany, been the lawful inheritor of Schleswig-Holstein, and that the\r\nPrince of Augustenburg had therefore no rights whatever in the Duchies. As\r\nthe claims of Christian had been transferred by the Treaty of Vienna to the\r\nsovereigns of Austria and Prussia jointly, it rested with them to decide\r\nwho should be Duke of Schleswig-Holstein, and under what conditions.\r\nBismarck announced at Vienna on the 22nd of February, 1865, the terms on\r\nwhich he was willing that Schleswig-Holstein should be conferred by the two\r\nsovereigns upon Frederick of Augustenburg. He required, in addition to\r\ncommunity of finance, postal system, and railways, that Prussian law,\r\nincluding the obligation to military service, should be introduced into the\r\nDuchies; that their regiments should take the oath of fidelity to the King\r\nof Prussia, and that their principal military positions should be held by\r\nPrussian troops. These conditions would have made Schleswig-Holstein in all\r\nbut name a part of the Prussian State: they were rejected both by the Court\r\nof Vienna and by Prince Frederick himself, and the population of\r\nSchleswig-Holstein almost unanimously declared against them. Both Austria\r\nand the Federal Diet now supported the Schleswig-Holsteiners in what\r\nappeared to be a struggle on behalf of their independence against Prussian\r\ndomination; and when the Prussian Commissioner in Schleswig-Holstein\r\nexpelled the most prominent of the adherents of Augustenburg, his Austrian\r\ncolleague published a protest declaring the act to be one of lawless\r\nviolence. It seemed that the outbreak of war between the two rival Powers\r\ncould not long be delayed; but Bismarck had on this occasion moved too\r\nrapidly for his master, and considerations relating to the other European\r\nPowers made it advisable to postpone the rupture for some months. An\r\nagreement was patched up at Gastein by which, pending an ultimate\r\nsettlement, the government of the two provinces was divided between their\r\nmasters, Austria taking the administration of Holstein, Prussia that of\r\nSchleswig, while the little district of Lauenburg on the south was made\r\nover to King William in full sovereignty. An actual conflict between the\r\nrepresentatives of the two rival governments at their joint headquarters in\r\nSchleswig-Holstein was thus averted; peace was made possible at least for\r\nsome months longer; and the interval was granted to Bismarck which was\r\nstill required for the education of his Sovereign in the policy of blood\r\nand iron, and for the completion of his own arrangements with the enemies\r\nof Austria outside Germany. [518]\r\n\r\n[Bismarck at Biarritz, Sept., 1865.]\r\n\r\nThe natural ally of Prussia was Italy; but without the sanction of Napoleon\r\nIII. it would have been difficult to engage Italy in a new war. Bismarck\r\nhad therefore to gain at least the passive concurrence of the French\r\nEmperor in the union of Italy and Prussia against Austria. He visited\r\nNapoleon at Biarritz in September, 1865, and returned with the object of\r\nhis journey achieved. The negotiation of Biarritz, if truthfully recorded,\r\nwould probably give the key to much of the European history of the next\r\nfive years. As at Plombières, the French Emperor acted without his\r\nMinisters, and what he asked he asked without a witness. That Bismarck\r\nactually promised to Napoleon III. either Belgium or any part of the\r\nRhenish Provinces in case of the aggrandisement of Prussia has been denied\r\nby him, and is not in itself probable. But there are understandings which\r\nprove to be understandings on one side only; politeness may be\r\nmisinterpreted; and the world would have found Count Bismarck unendurable\r\nif at every friendly meeting he had been guilty of the frankness with which\r\nhe informed the Austrian Government that its centre of action must be\r\ntransferred from Vienna to Pesth. That Napoleon was now scheming for an\r\nextension of France on the north-east is certain; that Bismarck treated\r\nsuch rectification of the frontier as a matter for arrangement is hardly to\r\nbe doubted; and if without a distinct and written agreement Napoleon was\r\ncontent to base his action on the belief that Bismarck would not withhold\r\nfrom him his reward, this only proved how great was the disparity between\r\nthe aims which the French ruler allowed himself to cherish and his mastery\r\nof the arts by which alone such aims were to be realised. Napoleon desired\r\nto see Italy placed in possession of Venice; he probably believed at this\r\ntime that Austria would be no unequal match for Prussia and Italy together,\r\nand that the natural result of a well-balanced struggle would be not only\r\nthe completion of Italian union but the purchase of French neutrality or\r\nmediation by the cession of German territory west of the Rhine. It was no\r\npart of the duty of Count Bismarck to chill Napoleon's fancies or to teach\r\nhim political wisdom. The Prussian statesman may have left Biarritz with\r\nthe conviction that an attack on Germany would sooner or later follow the\r\ndisappointment of those hopes which he had flattered and intended to mock;\r\nbut for the present he had removed one dangerous obstacle from his path,\r\nand the way lay free before him to an Italian alliance if Italy itself\r\nshould choose to combine with him in war.\r\n\r\n[Italy, 1862-65.]\r\n\r\nSince the death of Cavour the Italian Government had made no real progress\r\ntowards the attainment of the national aims, the acquisition of Rome and\r\nVenice. Garibaldi, impatient of delay, had in 1862 landed again in Sicily\r\nand summoned his followers to march with him upon Rome. But the enterprise\r\nwas resolutely condemned by Victor Emmanuel, and when Garibaldi crossed to\r\nthe mainland he found the King's troops in front of him at Aspromonte.\r\nThere was an exchange of shots, and Garibaldi fell wounded. He was treated\r\nwith something of the distinction shown to a royal prisoner, and when his\r\nwound was healed he was released from captivity. His enterprise, however,\r\nand the indiscreet comments on it made by Rattazzi, who was now in power,\r\nstrengthened the friends of the Papacy at the Tuileries, and resulted in\r\nthe fall of the Italian Minister. His successor, Minghetti, deemed it\r\nnecessary to arrive at some temporary understanding with Napoleon on the\r\nRoman question. The presence of French troops at Rome offended national\r\nfeeling, and made any attempt at conciliation between the Papal Court and\r\nthe Italian Government hopeless. In order to procure the removal of this\r\nforeign garrison Minghetti was willing to enter into engagements which\r\nseemed almost to imply the renunciation of the claim on Rome. By a\r\nConvention made in September, 1864, the Italian Government undertook not to\r\nattack the territory of the Pope, and to oppose by force every attack made\r\nupon it from without. Napoleon on his part engaged to withdraw his troops\r\ngradually from Rome as the Pope should organise his own army, and to\r\ncomplete the evacuation within two years. It was, however, stipulated in an\r\nArticle which was intended to be kept secret, that the capital of Italy\r\nshould be changed, the meaning of this stipulation being that Florence\r\nshould receive the dignity which by the common consent of Italy ought to\r\nhave been transferred from Turin to Rome and to Rome alone. The publication\r\nof this Article, which was followed by riots in Turin, caused the immediate\r\nfall of Minghetti's Cabinet. He was succeeded in office by General La\r\nMarmora, under whom the negotiations with Prussia were begun which, after\r\nlong uncertainty, resulted in the alliance of 1866 and in the final\r\nexpulsion of Austria from Italy. [519]\r\n\r\n[La Marmora.]\r\n\r\n[Govone at Berlin, March, 1866.]\r\n\r\n[Treaty of April 8, 1856.]\r\n\r\nBismarck from the beginning of his Ministry appears to have looked forward\r\nto the combination of Italy and Prussia against the common enemy; but his\r\nplans ripened slowly. In the spring of 1865, when affairs seemed to be\r\nreaching a crisis in Schleswig-Holstein, the first serious overtures were\r\nmade by the Prussian ambassador at Florence. La Marmora answered that any\r\ndefinite proposition would receive the careful attention of the Italian\r\nGovernment, but that Italy would not permit itself to be made a mere\r\ninstrument in Prussia's hands for the intimidation of Austria. Such caution\r\nwas both natural and necessary on the part of the Italian Minister; and his\r\nreserve seemed to be more than justified when, a few months later, the\r\nTreaty of Gastein restored Austria and Prussia to relations of friendship.\r\nLa Marmora might now well consider himself released from all obligations\r\ntowards the Court of Berlin: and, entering on a new line of policy, he sent\r\nan envoy to Vienna to ascertain if the Emperor would amicably cede Venetia\r\nto Italy in return for the payment of a very large sum of money and the\r\nassumption by Italy of part of the Austrian national debt. Had this\r\ntransaction been effected, it would probably have changed the course of\r\nEuropean history; the Emperor, however, declined to bargain away any part\r\nof his dominions, and so threw Italy once more into the camp of his great\r\nenemy. In the meantime the disputes about Schleswig-Holstein broke out\r\nafresh. Bismarck renewed his efforts at Florence in the spring of 1866,\r\nwith the result that General Govone was sent to Berlin in order to discuss\r\nwith the Prussian Minister the political and military conditions of an\r\nalliance. But instead of proposing immediate action, Bismarck stated to\r\nGovone that the question of Schleswig-Holstein was insufficient to justify\r\na great war in the eyes of Europe, and that a better cause must be put\r\nforward, namely, the reform of the Federal system of Germany. Once more the\r\nsubtle Italians believed that Bismarck's anxiety for a war with Austria was\r\nfeigned, and that he sought their friendship only as a means of extorting\r\nfrom the Court of Vienna its consent to Prussia's annexation of the Danish\r\nDuchies. There was an apparent effort on the part of the Prussian statesman\r\nto avoid entering into any engagement which involved immediate action; the\r\ntruth being that Bismarck was still in conflict with the pacific influences\r\nwhich surrounded the King, and uncertain from day to day whether his master\r\nwould really follow him in the policy of war. He sought therefore to make\r\nthe joint resort to arms dependent on some future act, such as the\r\nsummoning of a German Parliament, from which the King of Prussia could not\r\nrecede if once he should go so far. But the Italians, apparently not\r\npenetrating the real secret of Bismarck's hesitation, would be satisfied\r\nwith no such indeterminate engagement; they pressed for action within a\r\nlimited time; and in the end, after Austria had taken steps which went far\r\nto overcome the last scruples of King William, Bismarck consented to fix\r\nthree months as the limit beyond which the obligation of Italy to accompany\r\nPrussia into war should not extend. On the 8th of April a Treaty of\r\noffensive and defensive alliance was signed. It was agreed that if the King\r\nof Prussia should within three months take up arms for the reform of the\r\nFederal system of Germany, Italy would immediately after the outbreak of\r\nhostilities declare war upon Austria. Both Powers were to engage in the\r\nwar with their whole force, and peace was not to be made but by common\r\nconsent, such consent not to be withheld after Austria should have agreed\r\nto cede Venetia to Italy and territory with an equal population to Prussia.\r\n[520]\r\n\r\n[Bismarck and Austria, Aug., 1865-April, 1866.]\r\n\r\nEight months had now passed since the signature of the Convention of\r\nGastem. The experiment of an understanding with Austria, which King William\r\nhad deemed necessary, had been made, and it had failed; or rather, as\r\nBismarck expressed himself in a candid moment, it had succeeded, inasmuch\r\nas it had cured the King of his scruples and raised him to the proper point\r\nof indignation against the Austrian Court. The agents in effecting this\r\nhappy result had been the Prince of Augustenburg, the population of\r\nHolstein, and the Liberal party throughout Germany at large. In Schleswig,\r\nwhich the Convention of Gastein had handed over to Prussia, General\r\nManteuffel, a son of the Minister of 1850, had summarily put a stop to\r\nevery expression of public opinion, and had threatened to imprison the\r\nPrince if he came within his reach; in Holstein the Austrian Government had\r\npermitted, if it had not encouraged, the inhabitants to agitate in favour\r\nof the Pretender, and had allowed a mass-meeting to be held at Altona on\r\nthe 23rd of January, where cheers were raised for Augustenburg, and the\r\nsummoning of the Estates of Schleswig-Holstein was demanded. This was\r\nenough to enable Bismarck to denounce the conduct of Austria as an alliance\r\nwith revolution. He demanded explanations from the Government of Vienna,\r\nand the Emperor declined to render an account of his actions. Warlike\r\npreparations now began, and on the 16th of March the Austrian Government\r\nannounced that it should refer the affairs of Schleswig-Holstein to the\r\nFederal Diet. This was a clear departure from the terms of the Convention\r\nof Gastein, and from the agreement made between Austria and Prussia before\r\nentering into the Danish war in 1864 that the Schleswig-Holstein question\r\nshould be settled by the two Powers independently of the German Federation.\r\nKing William was deeply moved by such a breach of good faith; tears filled\r\nhis eyes when he spoke of the conduct of the Austrian Emperor; and though\r\npacific influences were still active around him he now began to fall in\r\nmore cordially with the warlike policy of his Minister. The question at\r\nissue between Prussia and Austria expanded from the mere disposal of the\r\nDuchies to the reconstitution of the Federal system of Germany. In a note\r\nlaid before the Governments of all the Minor States Bismarck declared that\r\nthe time had come when Germany must receive a new and more effective\r\norganisation, and inquired how far Prussia could count on the support of\r\nallies if it should be attacked by Austria or forced into war. It was\r\nimmediately after this re-opening of the whole problem of Federal reform in\r\nGermany that the draft of the Treaty with Italy was brought to its final\r\nshape by Bismarck and the Italian envoy, and sent to the Ministry at\r\nFlorence for its approval.\r\n\r\n[Austria offers Venice, May 5.]\r\n\r\nBismarck had now to make the best use of the three months' delay that was\r\ngranted to him. On the day after the acceptance of the Treaty by the\r\nItalian Government, the Prussian representative at the Diet of Frankfort\r\nhanded in a proposal for the summoning of a German Parliament, to be\r\nelected by universal suffrage. Coming from the Minister who had made\r\nParliamentary government a mockery in Prussia, this proposal was scarcely\r\nconsidered as serious. Bavaria, as the chief of the secondary States, had\r\nalready expressed its willingness to enter upon the discussion of Federal\r\nreform, but it asked that the two leading Powers should in the meantime\r\nundertake not to attack one another. Austria at once acceded to this\r\nrequest, and so forced Bismarck into giving a similar assurance. Promises\r\nof disarmament were then exchanged; but as Austria declined to stay the\r\ncollection of its forces in Venetia against Italy, Bismarck was able to\r\ncharge his adversary with insincerity in the negotiation, and preparations\r\nfor war were resumed on both sides. Other difficulties, however, now came\r\ninto view. The Treaty between Prussia and Italy had been made known to the\r\nCourt of Vienna by Napoleon, whose advice La Marmora had sought before its\r\nconclusion, and the Austrian Emperor had thus become aware of his danger.\r\nHe now determined to sacrifice Venetia if Italy's neutrality could be so\r\nsecured. On the 5th of May the Italian ambassador at Paris, Count Nigra,\r\nwas informed by Napoleon that Austria had offered to cede Venetia to him on\r\nbehalf of Victor Emmanuel if France and Italy would not prevent Austria\r\nfrom indemnifying itself at Prussia's expense in Silesia. Without a war, at\r\nthe price of mere inaction, Italy was offered all that it could gain by a\r\nstruggle which was likely to be a desperate one, and which might end in\r\ndisaster. La Marmora was in sore perplexity. Though he had formed a juster\r\nestimate of the capacity of the Prussian army than any other statesman or\r\nsoldier in Europe, he was thoroughly suspicious of the intentions of the\r\nPrussian Government; and in sanctioning the alliance of the previous month\r\nhe had done so half expecting that Bismarck would through the prestige of\r\nthis alliance gain for Prussia its own objects without entering into war,\r\nand then leave Italy to reckon with Austria as best it might. He would\r\ngladly have abandoned the alliance and have accepted Austria's offer if\r\nItaly could have done this without disgrace. But the sense of honour was\r\nsufficiently strong to carry him past this temptation. He declined the\r\noffer made through Paris, and continued the armaments of Italy, though\r\nstill with a secret hope that European diplomacy might find the means of\r\nrealising the purpose of his country without war. [521]\r\n\r\n[Proposals for a Congress.]\r\n\r\nThe neutral Powers were now, with various objects, bestirring themselves in\r\nfavour of a European Congress. Napoleon believed the time to be come when\r\nthe Treaties of 1815 might be finally obliterated by the joint act of\r\nEurope. He was himself ready to join Prussia with three hundred thousand\r\nmen if the King would transfer the Rhenish Provinces to France. Demands,\r\ndirect and indirect, were made on Count Bismarck on behalf of the Tuileries\r\nfor cessions of territory of greater or less extent. These demands were\r\nneither granted nor refused. Bismarck procrastinated; he spoke of the\r\nobstinacy of the King his master; he inquired whether parts of Belgium or\r\nSwitzerland would not better assimilate with France than a German province;\r\nhe put off the Emperor's representatives by the assurance that he could\r\nmore conveniently arrange these matters with the Emperor when he should\r\nhimself visit Paris. On the 28th of May invitations to a Congress were\r\nissued by France, England, and Russia jointly, the objects of the Congress\r\nbeing defined as the settlement of the affairs of Schleswig-Holstein, of\r\nthe differences between Austria and Italy, and of the reform of the Federal\r\nConstitution of Germany, in so far as these affected Europe at large. The\r\ninvitation was accepted by Prussia and by Italy; it was accepted by Austria\r\nonly under the condition that no arrangement should be discussed which\r\nshould give an increase of territory or power to one of the States invited\r\nto the Congress. This subtly-worded condition would not indeed have\r\nexcluded the equal aggrandisement of all. It would not have rendered the\r\ncession of Venetia to Italy or the annexation of Schleswig-Holstein to\r\nPrussia impossible; but it would either have involved the surrender of the\r\nformer Papal territory by Italy in order that Victor Emmanuel's dominions\r\nshould receive no increase, or, in the alternative, it would have entitled\r\nAustria to claim Silesia as its own equivalent for the augmentation of the\r\nItalian Kingdom. Such reservations would have rendered any efforts of the\r\nPowers to preserve peace useless, and they were accepted as tantamount to a\r\nrefusal on the part of Austria to attend the Congress. Simultaneously with\r\nits answer to the neutral Powers, Austria called upon the Federal Diet to\r\ntake the affairs of Schleswig-Holstein into its own hands, and convoked the\r\nHolstein Estates. Bismarck thereupon declared the Convention of Gastein to\r\nbe at an end, and ordered General Manteuffel to lead his troops into\r\nHolstein. The Austrian commander, protesting that he yielded only to\r\nsuperior force, withdrew through Altona into Hanover. Austria at once\r\ndemanded and obtained from the Diet of Frankfort the mobilisation of the\r\nwhole of the Federal armies. The representative of Prussia, declaring that\r\nthis act of the Diet had made an end of the existing Federal union, handed\r\nin the plan of his Government for the reorganisation of Germany, and\r\nquitted Frankfort. Diplomatic relations between Austria and Prussia were\r\nbroken off on the 12th of June, and on the 15th Count Bismarck demanded of\r\nthe sovereigns of Hanover, Saxony, and Hesse-Cassel, that they should on\r\nthat very day put a stop to their military preparations and accept the\r\nPrussian scheme of Federal reform. Negative answers being given, Prussian\r\ntroops immediately marched into these territories, and war began. Weimar,\r\nMecklenburg, and other petty States in the north took part with Prussia:\r\nall the rest of Germany joined Austria. [522]\r\n\r\n[German Opinion.]\r\n\r\nThe goal of Bismarck's desire, the end which he had steadily set before\r\nhimself since entering upon his Ministry, was attained; and, if his\r\ncalculations as to the strength of the Prussian army were not at fault,\r\nAustria was at length to be expelled from the German Federation by force of\r\narms. But the process by which Bismarck had worked up to this result had\r\nranged against him the almost unanimous opinion of Germany outside the\r\nmilitary circles of Prussia itself. His final demand for the summoning of a\r\nGerman Parliament was taken as mere comedy. The guiding star of his policy\r\nhad hitherto been the dynastic interest of the House of Hohenzollern; and\r\nnow, when the Germans were to be plunged into war with one another, it\r\nseemed as if the real object of the struggle was no more than the\r\nannexation of the Danish Duchies and some other coveted territory to the\r\nPrussian Kingdom. The voice of protest and condemnation rose loud from\r\nevery organ of public opinion. Even in Prussia itself the instances were\r\nfew where any spontaneous support was tendered to the Government. The\r\nParliament of Berlin, struggling up to the end against the all-powerful\r\nMinister, had seen its members prosecuted for speeches made within its own\r\nwalls, and had at last been prorogued in order that its insubordination\r\nmight not hamper the Crown in the moment of danger. But the mere\r\ndisappearance of Parliament could not conceal the intensity of ill-will\r\nwhich the Minister and his policy had excited. The author of a fratricidal\r\nwar of Germans against Germans was in the eyes of many the greatest of all\r\ncriminals; and on the 7th of May an attempt was made by a young fanatic to\r\ntake Bismarck's life in the streets of Berlin. The Minister owed the\r\npreservation of his life to the feebleness of his assailant's weapon and to\r\nhis own vigorous arm. But the imminence of the danger affected King William\r\nfar more than Bismarck himself. It spoke to his simple mind of supernatural\r\nprotection and aid; it stilled his doubts; and confirmed him in the belief\r\nthat Prussia was in this crisis the instrument for working out the\r\nAlmighty's will.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon III.]\r\n\r\nA few days before the outbreak of hostilities the Emperor Napoleon gave\r\npublicity to his own view of the European situation. He attributed the\r\ncoming war to three causes: to the faulty geographical limits of the\r\nPrussian State, to the desire for a better Federal system in Germany, and\r\nto the necessity felt by the Italian nation for securing its independence.\r\nThese needs would, he conceived, be met by a territorial rearrangement in\r\nthe north of Germany consolidating and augmenting the Prussian Kingdom; by\r\nthe creation of a more effective Federal union between the secondary German\r\nStates; and finally, by the incorporation of Venetia with Italy, Austria's\r\nposition in Germany remaining unimpaired. Only in the event of the map of\r\nEurope being altered to the exclusive advantage of one Great Power would\r\nFrance require an extension of frontier. Its interests lay in the\r\npreservation of the equilibrium of Europe, and in the maintenance of the\r\nItalian Kingdom. These had already been secured by arrangements which would\r\nnot require France to draw the sword; a watchful but unselfish neutrality\r\nwas the policy which its Government had determined to pursue. Napoleon had\r\nin fact lost all control over events, and all chance of gaining the Rhenish\r\nProvinces, from the time when he permitted Italy to enter into the Prussian\r\nalliance without any stipulation that France should at its option be\r\nadmitted as a third member of the coalition. He could not ally himself with\r\nAustria against his own creation, the Italian Kingdom; on the other hand,\r\nhe had no means of extorting cessions from Prussia when once Prussia was\r\nsure of an ally who could bring two hundred thousand men into the field.\r\nHis diplomacy had been successful in so far as it had assured Venetia to\r\nItaly whether Prussia should be victorious or overthrown, but as regarded\r\nFrance it had landed him in absolute powerlessness. He was unable to act on\r\none side; he was not wanted on the other. Neutrality had become a matter\r\nnot of choice but of necessity; and until the course of military events\r\nshould have produced some new situation in Europe, France might well be\r\nwatchful, but it could scarcely gain much credit for its disinterested\r\npart. [523]\r\n\r\n[Hanover and Hesse-Cassel conquered.]\r\n\r\n[The Bohemian Campaign, June 26-July 3.]\r\n\r\n[Battle of Königgrätz, July 3.]\r\n\r\nAssured against an attack from the side of the Rhine, Bismarck was able to\r\nthrow the mass of the Prussian forces southwards against Austria, leaving\r\nin the north only the modest contingent which was necessary to overcome the\r\nresistance of Hanover and Hesse-Cassel. Through the precipitancy of a\r\nPrussian general, who struck without waiting for his colleagues, the\r\nHanoverians gained a victory at Langensalza on the 27th of June; but other\r\nPrussian regiments arrived on the field a few hours later, and the\r\nHanoverian army was forced to capitulate on the next day. The King made his\r\nescape to Austria; the Elector of Hesse-Cassel, less fortunate, was made a\r\nprisoner of war. Northern Germany was thus speedily reduced to submission,\r\nand any danger of a diversion in favour of Austria in this quarter\r\ndisappeared. In Saxony no attempt was made to bar the way to the advancing\r\nPrussians. Dresden was occupied without resistance, but the Saxon army\r\nmarched southwards in good time, and joined the Austrians in Bohemia. The\r\nPrussian forces, about two hundred and fifty thousand strong, now gathered\r\non the Saxon and Silesian frontier, covering the line from Pirna to\r\nLandshut. They were composed of three armies: the first, or central, army\r\nunder Prince Frederick Charles, a nephew of the King; the second, or\r\nSilesian, army under the Crown Prince; the westernmost, known as the army\r\nof the Elbe, under General Herwarth von Bittenfeld. Against these were\r\nranged about an equal number of Austrians, led by Benedek, a general who\r\nhad gained great distinction in the Hungarian and the Italian campaigns. It\r\nhad at first been thought probable that Benedek, whose forces lay about\r\nOlmütz, would invade Southern Silesia, and the Prussian line had therefore\r\nbeen extended far to the east. Soon, however, it appeared that the\r\nAustrians were unable to take up the offensive, and Benedek moved westwards\r\ninto Bohemia. The Prussian line was now shortened, and orders were given to\r\nthe three armies to cross the Bohemian frontier and converge in the\r\ndirection of the town of Gitschin. General Moltke, the chief of the staff,\r\ndirected their operations from Berlin by telegraph. The combined advance of\r\nthe three armies was executed with extraordinary precision; and in a series\r\nof hard-fought combats extending from the 26th to the 29th of June the\r\nAustrians were driven back upon their centre, and effective communication\r\nwas established between the three invading bodies. On the 30th the King of\r\nPrussia, with General Moltke and Count Bismarck, left Berlin; on the 2nd of\r\nJuly they were at headquarters at Gitschin. It had been Benedek's design to\r\nleave a small force to hold the Silesian army in check, and to throw the\r\nmass of his army westwards upon Prince Frederick Charles and overwhelm him\r\nbefore he could receive help from his colleagues. This design had been\r\nbaffled by the energy of the Crown Prince's attack, and by the superiority\r\nof the Prussians in generalship, in the discipline of their troops, and in\r\nthe weapon they carried; for though the Austrians had witnessed in the\r\nDanish campaign the effects of the Prussian breech-loading rifle, they had\r\nnot thought it necessary to adopt a similar arm. Benedek, though no great\r\nbattle had yet been fought, saw that the campaign was lost, and wrote to\r\nthe Emperor on the 1st of July recommending him to make peace, for\r\notherwise a catastrophe was inevitable. He then concentrated his army on\r\nhigh ground a few miles west of Königgrätz, and prepared for a defensive\r\nbattle on the grandest scale. In spite of the losses of the past week he\r\ncould still bring about two hundred thousand men into action. The three\r\nPrussian armies were now near enough to one another to combine in their\r\nattack, and on the night of July 2nd the King sent orders to the three\r\ncommanders to move against Benedek before daybreak. Prince Frederick\r\nCharles, advancing through the village of Sadowa, was the first in the\r\nfield. For hours his divisions sustained an unequal struggle against the\r\nassembled strength of the Austrians. Midday passed; the defenders now\r\npressed down upon their assailants; and preparations for a retreat had been\r\nbegun, when the long-expected message arrived that the Crown Prince was\r\nclose at hand. The onslaught of the army of Silesia on Benedek's right,\r\nwhich was accompanied by the arrival of Herwarth at the other end of the\r\nfield of battle, at once decided the day. It was with difficulty that the\r\nAustrian commander prevented the enemy from seizing the positions which\r\nwould have cut off his retreat. He retired eastwards across the Elbe with a\r\nloss of eighteen thousand killed and wounded and twenty-four thousand\r\nprisoners. His army was ruined; and ten days after the Prussians had\r\ncrossed the frontier the war was practically at an end. [524]\r\n\r\n[Battle of Custozza, June 24.]\r\n\r\n[Napoleon's mediation, July 5.]\r\n\r\n[Preliminaries of Nicolsburg, July 26.]\r\n\r\n[Treaty of Prague, Aug. 23.]\r\n\r\nThe disaster of Königgrätz was too great to be neutralised by the success\r\nof the Austrian forces in Italy. La Marmora, who had given up his place at\r\nthe head of the Government in order to take command of the army, crossed\r\nthe Mincio at the head of a hundred and twenty thousand men, but was\r\ndefeated by inferior numbers on the fatal ground of Custozza, and compelled\r\nto fall back on the Oglio. This gleam of success, which was followed by a\r\nnaval victory at Lissa off the Istrian coast, made it easier for the\r\nAustrian Emperor to face the sacrifices that were now inevitable.\r\nImmediately after the battle of Königgrätz he invoked the mediation of\r\nNapoleon III., and ceded Venetia to him on behalf of Italy. Napoleon at\r\nonce tendered his good offices to the belligerents, and proposed an\r\narmistice. His mediation was accepted in principle by the King or Prussia,\r\nwho expressed his willingness also to grant an armistice as soon as\r\npreliminaries of peace were recognised by the Austrian Court. In the\r\nmeantime, while negotiations passed between all four Governments, the\r\nPrussians pushed forward until their outposts came within sight of Vienna.\r\nIf in pursuance of General Moltke's plan the Italian generals had thrown a\r\ncorps north-eastwards from the head of the Adriatic, and so struck at the\r\nvery heart of the Austrian monarchy, it is possible that the victors of\r\nKöniggrätz might have imposed their own terms without regard to Napoleon's\r\nmediation, and, while adding the Italian Tyrol to Victor Emmanuel's\r\ndominions, have completed the union of Germany under the House of\r\nHohenzollern at one stroke. But with Hungary still intact, and the Italian\r\narmy paralysed by the dissensions of its commanders, prudence bade the\r\ngreat statesman of Berlin content himself with the advantages which he\r\ncould reap without prolongation of the war, and without the risk of\r\nthrowing Napoleon into the enemy's camp. He had at first required, as\r\nconditions of peace, that Prussia should be left free to annex Saxony,\r\nHanover, Hesse-Cassel, and other North German territory; that Austria\r\nshould wholly withdraw from German affairs; and that all Germany, less the\r\nAustrian Provinces, should be united in a Federation under Prussian\r\nleadership. To gain the assent of Napoleon to these terms, Bismarck hinted\r\nthat France might by accord with Prussia annex Belgium. Napoleon, however,\r\nrefused to agree to the extension of Prussia's ascendency over all Germany,\r\nand presented a counter-project which was in its turn rejected by Bismarck.\r\nIt was finally settled that Prussia should not be prevented from annexing\r\nHanover, Nassau, and Hesse-Cassel, as conquered territory that lay between\r\nits own Rhenish Provinces and the rest of the kingdom; that Austria should\r\ncompletely withdraw from German affairs; that Germany north of the Main,\r\ntogether with Saxony, should be included in a Federation under Prussian\r\nleadership; and that for the States south of the Main there should be\r\nreserved the right of entering into some kind of national bond with the\r\nNorthern League. Austria escaped without loss of any of its non-Italian\r\nterritory; it also succeeded in preserving the existence of Saxony, which,\r\nas in 1815, the Prussian Government had been most anxious to annex.\r\nNapoleon, in confining the Prussian Federation to the north of the Main,\r\nand in securing by a formal stipulation in the Treaty the independence of\r\nthe Southern States, imagined himself to have broken Germany into halves,\r\nand to have laid the foundation of a South German League which should look\r\nto France as its protector. On the other hand, Bismarck by his annexation\r\nof Hanover and neighbouring districts had added a population of four\r\nmillions to the Prussian Kingdom, and given it a continuous territory; he\r\nhad forced Austria out of the German system; he had gained its sanction to\r\nthe Federal union of all Germany north of the Main, and had at least kept\r\nthe way open for the later extension of this union to the Southern States.\r\nPreliminaries of peace embodying these conditions and recognising Prussia's\r\nsovereignty in Schleswig-Holstein were signed at Nicolsburg on the 26th of\r\nJuly, and formed the basis of the definitive Treaty of Peace which was\r\nconcluded at Prague on the 23rd of August. An illusory clause, added at the\r\ninstance of Napoleon, provided that if the population of the northern\r\ndistricts of Schleswig should by a free vote express the wish to be united\r\nwith Denmark, these districts should be ceded to the Danish Kingdom. [525]\r\n\r\n[The South German States.]\r\n\r\n[Secret Treaties of the Southern States with Prussia.]\r\n\r\nBavaria and the south-western allies of Austria, though their military\r\naction was of an ineffective character, continued in arms for some weeks\r\nafter the battle of Königgrätz and the suspension of hostilities arranged\r\nat Nicolsburg did not come into operation on their behalf till the 2nd of\r\nAugust. Before that date their forces were dispersed and their power of\r\nresistance broken by the Prussian generals Falckenstein and Manteuffel in a\r\nseries of unimportant engagements and intricate manoeuvres. The City of\r\nFrankfort, against which Bismarck seems to have borne some personal hatred,\r\nwas treated for a while by the conquerors with extraordinary and most\r\nimpolitic harshness; in other respects the action of the Prussian\r\nGovernment towards these conquered States was not such as to render future\r\nunion and friendship difficult. All the South German Governments, with the\r\nsingle exception of Baden, appealed to the Emperor Napoleon for assistance\r\nin the negotiations which they had opened at Berlin. But at the very moment\r\nwhen this request was made and granted Napoleon was himself demanding from\r\nBismarck the cession of the Bavarian Palatinate and of the Hessian\r\ndistricts west of the Rhine. Bismarck had only to acquaint the King of\r\nBavaria and the South German Ministers with the designs of their French\r\nprotector in order to reconcile them to his own chastening, but not\r\nunfriendly, hand. The grandeur of a united Fatherland flashed upon minds\r\nhitherto impenetrable by any national ideal when it became known that\r\nNapoleon was bargaining for Oppenheim and Kaiserslautern. Not only were the\r\ninsignificant questions as to the war-indemnities to be paid to Prussia and\r\nthe frontier villages to be exchanged promptly settled, but by a series of\r\nsecret Treaties all the South German States entered into an offensive and\r\ndefensive alliance with the Prussian King, and engaged in case of war to\r\nplace their entire forces at his disposal and under his command. The\r\ndiplomacy of Napoleon III. had in the end effected for Bismarck almost more\r\nthan his earlier intervention had frustrated, for it had made the South\r\nGerman Courts the allies of Prussia not through conquest or mere compulsion\r\nbut out of regard for their own interests. [526] It was said by the\r\nopponents of the Imperial Government in France, and scarcely with\r\nexaggeration, that every error which it was possible to commit had, in the\r\ncourse of the year 1866, been committed by Napoleon III. One crime, one act\r\nof madness, remained open to the Emperor's critics, to lash him and France\r\ninto a conflict with the Power whose union he had not been able to prevent.\r\n\r\n[Projects of compensation for France.]\r\n\r\nPrior to the battle of Königgrätz, it would seem that all the suggestions\r\nof the French Emperor relating to the acquisition of Belgium were made to\r\nthe Prussian Government through secret agents, and that they were actually\r\nunknown, or known by mere hearsay, to Benedetti, the French Ambassador at\r\nBerlin. According to Prince Bismarck, these overtures had begun as early as\r\n1862, when he was himself Ambassador at Paris, and were then made verbally\r\nand in private notes to himself; they were the secret of Napoleon's\r\nneutrality during the Danish war; and were renewed through relatives and\r\nconfidential agents of the Emperor when the struggle with Austria was seen\r\nto be approaching. The ignorance in which Count Benedetti was kept of his\r\nmaster's private diplomacy may to some extent explain the extraordinary\r\ncontradictions between the accounts given by this Minister and by Prince\r\nBismarck of the negotiations that passed between them in the period\r\nfollowing the campaign of 1866, after Benedetti had himself been charged to\r\npresent the demands of the French Government. In June, while the Ambassador\r\nwas still, as it would seem, in ignorance of what was passing behind his\r\nback, he had informed the French Ministry that Bismarck, anxious for the\r\npreservation of French neutrality, had hinted at the compensations that\r\nmight be made to France if Prussia should meet with great success in the\r\ncoming war. According to the report of the Ambassador, made at the time,\r\nCount Bismarck stated that he would rather withdraw from public life than\r\ncede the Rhenish Provinces with Cologne and Bonn, but that he believed it\r\nwould be possible to gain the King's ultimate consent to the cession of the\r\nPrussian district of Trèves on the Upper Moselle, which district, together\r\nwith Luxemburg or parts of Belgium and Switzerland, would give France an\r\nadequate improvement of its frontier. The Ambassador added in his report,\r\nby way of comment, that Count Bismarck was the only man in the kingdom who\r\nwas disposed to make any cession of Prussian territory whatever, and that a\r\nunanimous and violent revulsion against France would be excited by the\r\nslightest indication of any intention on the part of the French Government\r\nto extend its frontiers towards the Rhine. He concluded his report with the\r\nstatement that, after hearing Count Bismarck's suggestions, he had brought\r\nthe discussion to a summary close, not wishing to leave the Prussian\r\nMinister under the impression that any scheme involving the seizure of\r\nBelgian or Swiss territory had the slightest chance of being seriously\r\nconsidered at Paris. (June 4-8.)\r\n\r\n[Demand for Rhenish territory, July 25-Aug. 7, 1866.]\r\n\r\n[The Belgian project, Aug. 16-30.]\r\n\r\nBenedetti probably wrote these last words in full sincerity. Seven weeks\r\nlater, after the settlement of the Preliminaries at Nicolsburg, he was\r\nordered to demand the cession of the Bavarian Palatinate, of the portion of\r\nHesse-Darmstadt west of the Rhine, including Mainz, and of the strip of\r\nPrussian territory on the Saar which had been left to France in 1814 but\r\ntaken from it in 1815. According to the statement of Prince Bismarck, which\r\nwould seem to be exaggerated, this demand was made by Benedetti as an\r\nultimatum and with direct threats of war, which were answered by Bismarck\r\nin language of equal violence. In any case the demand was unconditionally\r\nrefused, and Benedetti travelled to Paris in order to describe what had\r\npassed at the Prussian headquarters. His report made such an impression on\r\nthe Emperor that the demand for cessions on the Rhine was at once\r\nabandoned, and the Foreign Minister, Drouyn de Lhuys, who had been disposed\r\nto enforce this by arms, was compelled to quit office. Benedetti returned\r\nto Berlin, and now there took place that negotiation relating to Belgium on\r\nwhich not only the narratives of the persons immediately concerned, but the\r\ndocuments written at the time, leave so much that is strange and\r\nunexplained. According to Benedetti, Count Bismarck was keenly anxious to\r\nextend the German Federation to the South of the Main, and desired with\r\nthis object an intimate union with at least one Great Power. He sought in\r\nthe first instance the support of France, and offered in return to\r\nfacilitate the seizure of Belgium. The negotiation, according to Benedetti,\r\nfailed because the Emperor Napoleon required that the fortresses in\r\nSouthern Germany should be held by the troops of the respective States to\r\nwhich they belonged, while at the same time General Manteuffel, who had\r\nbeen sent from Berlin on a special mission to St. Petersburg, succeeded in\r\neffecting so intimate a union with Russia that alliance with France became\r\nunnecessary. According to the counter-statement of Prince Bismarck, the\r\nplan now proposed originated entirely with the French Ambassador, and was\r\nmerely a repetition of proposals which had been made by Napoleon during the\r\npreceding four years, and which were subsequently renewed at intervals by\r\nsecret agents almost down to the outbreak of the war of 1870. Prince\r\nBismarck has stated that he dallied with these proposals only because a\r\ndirect refusal might at any moment have caused the outbreak of war between\r\nFrance and Prussia, a catastrophe which up to the end he sought to avert.\r\nIn any case the negotiation with Benedetti led to no conclusion, and was\r\nbroken off by the departure of both statesmen from Berlin in the beginning\r\nof autumn. [527]\r\n\r\n[Prussia and North Germany after the war.]\r\n\r\nThe war of 1866 had been brought to an end with extraordinary rapidity; its\r\nresults were solid and imposing. Venice, perplexed no longer by its\r\nRepublican traditions or by doubts of the patriotism of the House of Savoy,\r\nprepared to welcome King Victor Emmanuel; Bismarck, returning from the\r\nbattle-field of Königgrätz, found his earlier unpopularity forgotten in the\r\nflood of national enthusiasm which his achievements and those of the army\r\nhad evoked. A new epoch had begun; the antagonisms of the past were out of\r\ndate; nobler work now stood before the Prussian people and its rulers than\r\nthe perpetuation of a barren struggle between Crown and Parliament. By none\r\nwas the severance from the past more openly expressed than by Bismarck\r\nhimself; by none was it more bitterly felt than by the old Conservative\r\nparty in Prussia, who had hitherto regarded the Minister as their own\r\nrepresentative. In drawing up the Constitution of the North German\r\nFederation, Bismarck remained true to the principle which he had laid down\r\nat Frankfort before the war, that the German people must be represented by\r\na Parliament elected directly by the people themselves. In the\r\nincorporation of Hanover, Hesse-Cassel and the Danish Duchies with Prussia,\r\nhe saw that it would be impossible to win the new populations to a loyal\r\nunion with Prussia if the King's Government continued to recognise no\r\nfriends but the landed aristocracy and the army. He frankly declared that\r\nthe action of the Cabinet in raising taxes without the consent of\r\nParliament had been illegal, and asked for an Act of Indemnity. The\r\nParliament of Berlin understood and welcomed the message of reconciliation.\r\nIt heartily forgave the past, and on its own initiative added the name of\r\nBismarck to those for whose services to the State the King asked a\r\nrecompense. The Progressist party, which had constituted the majority in\r\nthe last Parliament, gave place to a new combination known as the National\r\nLiberal party, which, while adhering to the Progressist creed in domestic\r\naffairs, gave its allegiance to the Foreign and the German policy of the\r\nMinister. Within this party many able men who in Hanover and the other\r\nannexed territories had been the leaders of opposition to their own\r\nGovernments now found a larger scope and a greater political career. More\r\nthan one of the colleagues of Bismarck who had been appointed to their\r\noffices in the years of conflict were allowed to pass into retirement, and\r\ntheir places were filled by men in sympathy with the National Liberals.\r\nWith the expansion of Prussia and the establishment of its leadership in a\r\nGerman Federal union, the ruler of Prussia seemed himself to expand from\r\nthe instrument of a military monarchy to the representative of a great\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n[Hungary and Austria, 1865.]\r\n\r\nTo Austria the battle of Königgrätz brought a settlement of the conflict\r\nbetween the Crown and Hungary. The Constitution of February, 1861,\r\nhopefully as it had worked during its first years, had in the end fallen\r\nbefore the steady refusal of the Magyars to recognise the authority of a\r\nsingle Parliament for the whole Monarchy. Within the Reichsrath itself the\r\nexample of Hungary told as a disintegrating force; the Poles, the Czechs\r\nseceded from the Assembly; the Minister, Schmerling, lost his authority,\r\nand was forced to resign in the summer of 1865. Soon afterwards an edict of\r\nthe Emperor suspended the Constitution. Count Belcredi, who took office in\r\nSchmerling's place, attempted to arrive at an understanding with the Magyar\r\nleaders. The Hungarian Diet was convoked, and was opened by the King in\r\nperson before the end of the year. Francis Joseph announced his abandonment\r\nof the principle that Hungary had forfeited its ancient rights by\r\nrebellion, and asked in return that the Diet should not insist upon\r\nregarding the laws of 1848 as still in force. Whatever might be the formal\r\nvalidity of those laws, it was, he urged, impossible that they should be\r\nbrought into operation unaltered. For the common affairs of the two halves\r\nof the Monarchy there must be some common authority. It rested with the\r\nDiet to arrive at the necessary understanding with the Sovereign on this\r\npoint, and to place on a satisfactory footing the relations of Hungary to\r\nTransylvania and Croatia. As soon as an accord should have been reached on\r\nthese subjects, Francis Joseph stated that he would complete his\r\nreconciliation with the Magyars by being crowned King of Hungary.\r\n\r\n[Deák.]\r\n\r\nIn the Assembly to which these words were addressed the majority was\r\ncomposed of men of moderate opinions, under the leadership of Francis Deák.\r\nDeák had drawn up the programme of the Hungarian Liberals in the election\r\nof 1847. He had at that time appeared to be marked out by his rare\r\npolitical capacity and the simple manliness of his character for a great,\r\nif not the greatest, part in the work that then lay before his country. But\r\nthe violence of revolutionary methods was alien to his temperament. After\r\nserving in Batthyány's Ministry, he withdrew from public life on the\r\noutbreak of war with Austria, and remained in retirement during the\r\ndictatorship of Kossuth and the struggle of 1849. As a loyal friend to the\r\nHapsburg dynasty, and a clear-sighted judge of the possibilities of the\r\ntime, he stood apart while Kossuth dethroned the Sovereign and proclaimed\r\nHungarian independence. Of the patriotism and the disinterestedness of Deák\r\nthere was never the shadow of a doubt; a distinct political faith severed\r\nhim from the leaders whose enterprise ended in the catastrophe which he had\r\nforeseen, and preserved for Hungary one statesman who could, without\r\nrenouncing his own past and without inflicting humiliation on the\r\nSovereign, stand as the mediator between Hungary and Austria when the time\r\nfor reconciliation should arrive. Deák was little disposed to abate\r\nanything of what he considered the just demands of his country. It was\r\nunder his leadership that the Diet had in 1861 refused to accept the\r\nConstitution which established a single Parliament for the whole Monarchy.\r\nThe legislative independence of Hungary he was determined at all costs to\r\npreserve intact; rather than surrender this he had been willing in 1861 to\r\nsee negotiations broken off and military rule restored. But when Francis\r\nJoseph, wearied of the sixteen years' struggle, appealed once more to\r\nHungary for union and friendship, there was no man more earnestly desirous\r\nto reconcile the Sovereign with the nation, and to smooth down the\r\nopposition to the King's proposals which arose within the Diet itself, than\r\nDeák.\r\n\r\n[Scheme of Hungarian Committee, June 25, 1866.]\r\n\r\nUnder his influence a committee was appointed to frame the necessary basis\r\nof negotiation. On the 25th of June, 1866, the Committee gave in its\r\nreport. It declared against any Parliamentary union with the Cis-Leithan\r\nhalf of the Monarchy, but consented to the establishment of common\r\nMinistries for War, Finance, and Foreign Affairs, and recommended that the\r\nBudget necessary for these joint Ministries should be settled by\r\nDelegations from the Hungarian Diet and from the western Reichsrath. [528]\r\nThe Delegations, it was proposed, should meet separately, and communicate\r\ntheir views to one another by writing. Only when agreement should not have\r\nbeen thus attained were the Delegations to unite in a single body, in which\r\ncase the decision was to rest with an absolute majority of votes.\r\n\r\n[Negotiations with Hungary after Königgrätz.]\r\n\r\n[Federalism or Dualism.]\r\n\r\n[Settlement by Beust.]\r\n\r\n[Francis Joseph's Coronation, June 8, 1867.]\r\n\r\nThe debates of the Diet on the proposals of King Francis Joseph had been\r\nlong and anxious; it was not until the moment when the war with Prussia was\r\nbreaking out that the Committee presented its report. The Diet was now\r\nprorogued, but immediately after the battle of Königgrätz the Hungarian\r\nleaders were called to Vienna, and negotiations were pushed forward on the\r\nlines laid down by the Committee. It was a matter of no small moment to the\r\nCourt of Vienna that while bodies of Hungarian exiles had been preparing to\r\nattack the Empire both from the side of Silesia and of Venice, Deák and his\r\nfriends had loyally abstained from any communication with the foreign\r\nenemies of the House of Hapsburg. That Hungary would now gain almost\r\ncomplete independence was certain; the question was not so much whether\r\nthere should be an independent Parliament and Ministry at Pesth as whether\r\nthere should not be a similarly independent Parliament and Ministry in each\r\nof the territories of the Crown, the Austrian Sovereign becoming the head\r\nof a Federation instead of the chief of a single or a dual State. Count\r\nBelcredi, the Minister at Vienna, was disposed towards such a Federal\r\nsystem; he was, however, now confronted within the Cabinet by a rival who\r\nrepresented a different policy. After making peace with Prussia, the\r\nEmperor called to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Count Beust, who had\r\nhitherto been at the head of the Saxon Government, and who had been the\r\nrepresentative of the German Federation at the London Conference of 1864.\r\nBeust, while ready to grant the Hungarians their independence, advocated\r\nthe retention of the existing Reichsrath and of a single Ministry for all\r\nthe Cis-Leithan parts of the Monarchy. His plan, which pointed to the\r\nmaintenance of German ascendency in the western provinces, and which deeply\r\noffended the Czechs and the Slavic populations, was accepted by the\r\nEmperor: Belcredi withdrew from office, and Beust was charged, as President\r\nof the Cabinet, with the completion of the settlement with Hungary (Feb. 7,\r\n1867). Deák had hitherto left the chief ostensible part in the negotiations\r\nto Count Andrássy, one of the younger patriots of 1848, who had been\r\ncondemned to be hanged, and had lived a refugee during the next ten years.\r\nHe now came to Vienna himself, and in the course of a few days removed the\r\nlast remaining difficulties. The King gratefully charged him with the\r\nformation of the Hungarian Ministry under the restored Constitution, but\r\nDeák declined alike all office, honours, and rewards, and Andrássy, who had\r\nactually been hanged in effigy, was placed at the head of the Government.\r\nThe Diet, which had reassembled shortly before the end of 1866, greeted the\r\nnational Ministry with enthusiasm. Alterations in the laws of 1848 proposed\r\nin accordance with the agreement made at Vienna, and establishing the three\r\ncommon Ministries with the system of Delegations for common affairs, were\r\ncarried by large majorities. [529] The abdication of Ferdinand, which\r\nthroughout the struggle of 1849 Hungary had declined to recognise, was now\r\nacknowledged as valid, and on the 8th of June, 1867, Francis Joseph was\r\ncrowned King of Hungary amid the acclamations of Pesth. The gift of money\r\nwhich is made to each Hungarian monarch on his coronation Francis Joseph by\r\na happy impulse distributed among the families of those who had fallen in\r\nfighting against him in 1849. A universal amnesty was proclaimed, no\r\ncondition being imposed on the return of the exiles but that they should\r\nacknowledge the existing Constitution. Kossuth alone refused to return to\r\nhis country so long as a Hapsburg should be its King, and proudly clung to\r\nideas which were already those of the past.\r\n\r\n[Hungary since 1867.]\r\n\r\nThe victory of the Magyars was indeed but too complete. Not only were Beust\r\nand the representatives of the western half of the Monarchy so overmatched\r\nby the Hungarian negotiators that in the distribution of the financial\r\nburdens of the Empire Hungary escaped with far too small a share, but in\r\nthe more important problem of the relation of the Slavic and Roumanian\r\npopulations of the Hungarian Kingdom to the dominant race no adequate steps\r\nwere taken for the protection of these subject nationalities. That Croatia\r\nand Transylvania should be reunited with Hungary if the Emperor and the\r\nMagyars were ever to be reconciled was inevitable; and in the case of\r\nCroatia certain conditions were no doubt imposed, and certain local rights\r\nguaranteed. But on the whole the non-Magyar peoples in Hungary were handed\r\nover to the discretion of the ruling race. The demand of Bismarck that the\r\ncentre of gravity of the Austrian States should be transferred from Vienna\r\nto Pesth had indeed been brought to pass. While in the western half of the\r\nMonarchy the central authority, still represented by a single Parliament,\r\nseemed in the succeeding years to be altogether losing its cohesive power,\r\nand the political life of Austria became a series of distracting\r\ncomplications, in Hungary the Magyar Government resolutely set itself to\r\nthe task of moulding into one the nationalities over which it ruled.\r\nUniting the characteristic faults with the great qualities of a race marked\r\nout by Nature and ancient habit for domination over more numerous but less\r\naggressive neighbours, the Magyars have steadily sought to the best of\r\ntheir power to obliterate the distinctions which make Hungary in reality\r\nnot one but several nations. They have held the Slavic and the Roumanian\r\npopulation within their borders with an iron grasp, but they have not\r\ngained their affection. The memory of the Russian intervention in 1849 and\r\nof the part then played by Serbs, by Croats and Roumanians in crushing\r\nMagyar independence has blinded the victors to the just claims of these\r\nraces both within and without the Hungarian kingdom, and attached their\r\nsympathy to the hateful and outworn empire of the Turk. But the\r\nindividuality of peoples is not to be blotted out in a day; nor, with all\r\nits striking advance in wealth, in civilisation, and in military power, has\r\nthe Magyar State been able to free itself from the insecurity arising from\r\nthe presence of independent communities on its immediate frontiers\r\nbelonging to the same race as those whose language and nationality it seeks\r\nto repress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nNapoleon III.--The Mexican Expedition--Withdrawal of the French and death\r\nof Maximilian--The Luxemburg Question--Exasperation in France against\r\nPrussia--Austria--Italy--Mentana--Germany after 1866--The Spanish\r\ncandidature of Leopold of Hohenzollern--French declaration--Benedetti and\r\nKing William--Withdrawal of Leopold and demand for guarantees--The\r\ntelegram from Ems--War--Expected Alliances of France--Austria--Italy--\r\nPrussian plans--The French army--Causes of French inferiority--\r\nWeissenburg--Wörth--Spicheren--Borny--Mars-la-Tour--Gravelotte--Sedan--\r\nThe Republic proclaimed at Paris--Favre and Bismarck--Siege of\r\nParis--Gambetta at Tours--The Army of the Loire--Fall of Metz--Fighting\r\nat Orleans--Sortie of Champigny--The Armies of the North, of the Loire,\r\nof the East--Bourbaki's ruin--Capitulation of Paris and Armistice--\r\nPreliminaries of Peace--Germany--Establishment of the German Empire--The\r\nCommune of Paris--Second siege--Effects of the war as to Russia and\r\nItaly--Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Napoleon III.]\r\n\r\nThe reputation of Napoleon III. was perhaps at its height at the end of the\r\nfirst ten years of his reign. His victories over Russia and Austria had\r\nflattered the military pride of France; the flowing tide of commercial\r\nprosperity bore witness, as it seemed, to the blessings of a government at\r\nonce firm and enlightened; the reconstruction of Paris dazzled a generation\r\naccustomed to the mean and dingy aspect of London and other capitals before\r\n1850, and scarcely conscious of the presence or absence of real beauty and\r\ndignity where it saw spaciousness and brilliance. The political faults of\r\nNapoleon, the shiftiness and incoherence of his designs, his want of grasp\r\non reality, his absolute personal nullity as an administrator, were known\r\nto some few, but they had not been displayed to the world at large. He had\r\ndone some great things, he had conspicuously failed in nothing. Had his\r\nreign ended before 1863, he would probably have left behind him in popular\r\nmemory the name of a great ruler. But from this time his fortune paled. The\r\nrepulse of his intervention on behalf of Poland in 1863 by the Russian\r\nCourt, his petulant or miscalculating inaction during the Danish War of the\r\nfollowing year, showed those to be mistaken who had imagined that the\r\nEmperor must always exercise a controlling power in Europe. During the\r\nevents which formed the first stage in the consolidation of Germany his\r\npolicy was a succession of errors. Simultaneously with the miscarriage of\r\nhis European schemes, an enterprise which he had undertaken beyond the\r\nAtlantic, and which seriously weakened his resources at a time when\r\nconcentrated strength alone could tell on European affairs, ended in\r\ntragedy and disgrace.\r\n\r\n[The Mexican Project.]\r\n\r\nThere were in Napoleon III., as a man of State, two personalities, two\r\nmental existences, which blended but ill with one another. There was the\r\ncontemplator of great human forces, the intelligent, if not deeply\r\npenetrative, reader of the signs of the times, the brooder through long\r\nyears of imprisonment and exile, the child of Europe, to whom Germany,\r\nItaly, and England had all in turn been nearer than his own country; and\r\nthere was the crowned adventurer, bound by his name and position to gain\r\nfor France something that it did not possess, and to regard the greatness\r\nof every other nation as an impediment to the ascendency of his own.\r\nNapoleon correctly judged the principle of nationality to be the dominant\r\nforce in the immediate future of Europe. He saw in Italy and in Germany\r\nraces whose internal divisions alone had prevented them from being the\r\nformidable rivals of France, and yet he assisted the one nation to effect\r\nits union, and was not indisposed, within certain limits, to promote the\r\nconsolidation of the other. That the acquisition of Nice and Savoy, and\r\neven of the Rhenish Provinces, could not in itself make up to France for\r\nthe establishment of two great nations on its immediate frontiers Napoleon\r\nmust have well understood: he sought to carry the principle of\r\nagglomeration a stage farther in the interests of France itself, and to\r\nform some moral, if not political, union of the Latin nations, which should\r\nembrace under his own ascendency communities beyond the Atlantic as well as\r\nthose of the Old World. It was with this design that in the year 1862 he\r\nmade the financial misdemeanours of Mexico the pretext for an expedition to\r\nthat country, the object of which was to subvert the native Republican\r\nGovernment, and to place the Hapsburg Maximilian, as a vassal prince, on\r\nits throne. England and Spain had at first agreed to unite with France in\r\nenforcing the claims of the European creditors of Mexico; but as soon as\r\nNapoleon had made public his real intentions these Powers withdrew their\r\nforces, and the Emperor was left free to carry out his plans alone.\r\n\r\n[The Mexican Expedition, 1862-1865.]\r\n\r\n[Napoleon compelled to withdraw, 1866-7.]\r\n\r\n[Fall and Death of Maximilian.]\r\n\r\nThe design of Napoleon to establish French influence in Mexico was\r\nconnected with his attempt to break up the United States by establishing\r\nthe independence of the Southern Confederacy, then in rebellion, through\r\nthe mediation of the Great Powers of Europe. So long as the Civil War in\r\nthe United States lasted, it seemed likely that Napoleon's enterprise in\r\nMexico would be successful. Maximilian was placed upon the throne, and the\r\nRepublican leader, Juarez, was driven into the extreme north of the\r\ncountry. But with the overthrow of the Southern Confederacy and the\r\nrestoration of peace in the United States in 1865 the prospect totally\r\nchanged. The Government of Washington refused to acknowledge any authority\r\nin Mexico but that of Juarez, and informed Napoleon in courteous terms that\r\nhis troops must be withdrawn. Napoleon had bound himself by Treaty to keep\r\ntwenty-five thousand men in Mexico for the protection of Maximilian. He\r\nwas, however, unable to defy the order of the United States. Early in 1866\r\nhe acquainted Maximilian with the necessities of the situation, and with\r\nthe approaching removal of the force which alone had placed him and could\r\nsustain him on the throne. The unfortunate prince sent his consort, the\r\ndaughter of the King of the Belgians, to Europe to plead against this act\r\nof desertion; but her efforts were vain, and her reason sank under the just\r\npresentiment of her husband's ruin. The utmost on which Napoleon could\r\nventure was the postponement of the recall of his troops till the spring of\r\n1867. He urged Maximilian to abdicate before it was too late; but the\r\nprince refused to dissociate himself from his counsellors who still\r\nimplored him to remain. Meanwhile the Juarists pressed back towards the\r\ncapital from north and south. As the French detachments were withdrawn\r\ntowards the coast the entire country fell into their hands. The last French\r\nsoldiers quitted Mexico at the beginning of March, 1867, and on the 15th of\r\nMay, Maximilian, still lingering at Queretaro, was made prisoner by the\r\nRepublicans. He had himself while in power ordered that the partisans of\r\nJuarez should be treated not as soldiers but as brigands, and that when\r\ncaptured they should be tried by court-martial and executed within\r\ntwenty-four hours. The same severity was applied to himself. He was\r\nsentenced to death and shot at Queretaro on the 19th of June.\r\n\r\n[Decline of Napoleon's reputation.]\r\n\r\nThus ended the attempt of Napoleon III. to establish the influence of\r\nFrance and of his dynasty beyond the seas. The doom of Maximilian excited\r\nthe compassion of Europe; a deep, irreparable wound was inflicted on the\r\nreputation of the man who had tempted him to his treacherous throne, who\r\nhad guaranteed him protection, and at the bidding of a superior power had\r\nabandoned him to his ruin. From this time, though the outward splendour of\r\nthe Empire was undiminished, there remained scarcely anything of the\r\npersonal prestige which Napoleon had once enjoyed in so rich a measure. He\r\nwas no longer in the eyes of Europe or of his own country the profound,\r\nself-contained statesman in whose brain lay the secret of coming events; he\r\nwas rather the gambler whom fortune was preparing to desert, the usurper\r\ntrembling for the future of his dynasty and his crown. Premature old age\r\nand a harassing bodily ailment began to incapacitate him for personal\r\nexertion. He sought to loosen the reins in which his despotism held France,\r\nand to make a compromise with public opinion which was now declaring\r\nagainst him. And although his own cooler judgment set little store by any\r\naddition of frontier strips of alien territory to France, and he would\r\nprobably have been best pleased to pass the remainder of his reign in\r\nundisturbed inaction, he deemed it necessary, after failure in Mexico had\r\nbecome inevitable, to seek some satisfaction in Europe for the injured\r\npride of his country. He entered into negotiations with the King of Holland\r\nfor the cession of Luxemburg, and had gained his assent, when rumours of\r\nthe transaction reached the North German Press, and the project passed from\r\nout the control of diplomatists and became an affair of rival nations.\r\n\r\n[The Luxemburg question, Feb.-May, 1867.]\r\n\r\nLuxemburg, which was an independent Duchy ruled by the King of Holland, had\r\nuntil 1866 formed a part of the German Federation; and although Bismarck\r\nhad not attempted to include it in his own North German Union, Prussia\r\nretained by the Treaties of 1815 a right to garrison the fortress of\r\nLuxemburg, and its troops were actually there in possession. The proposed\r\ntransfer of the Duchy to France excited an outburst of patriotic resentment\r\nin the Federal Parliament at Berlin. The population of Luxemburg was indeed\r\nnot wholly German, and it had shown the strongest disinclination to enter\r\nthe North German league; but the connection of the Duchy with Germany in\r\nthe past was close enough to explain the indignation roused by Napoleon's\r\nproject among politicians who little suspected that during the previous\r\nyear Bismarck himself had cordially recommended this annexation, and that\r\nup to the last moment he had been privy to the Emperor's plan. The Prussian\r\nMinister, though he did not affect to share the emotion of his countrymen,\r\nstated that his policy in regard to Luxemburg must be influenced by the\r\nopinion of the Federal Parliament, and he shortly afterwards caused it to\r\nbe understood at Paris that the annexation of the Duchy to France was\r\nimpossible. As a warning to France he had already published the Treaties of\r\nalliance between Prussia and the South German States, which had been made\r\nat the close of the war of 1866, but had hitherto been kept secret. [530]\r\nOther powers now began to tender their good offices. Count Beust, on behalf\r\nof Austria, suggested that Luxemburg should be united to Belgium, which in\r\nits turn should cede a small district to France. This arrangement, which\r\nwould have been accepted at Berlin, and which, by soothing the irritation\r\nproduced in France by Prussia's successes, would possibly have averted the\r\nwar of 1870, was frustrated by the refusal of the King of Belgium to part\r\nwith any of his territory--Napoleon, disclaiming all desire for territorial\r\nextension, now asked only for the withdrawal of the Prussian garrison from\r\nLuxemburg; but it was known that he was determined to enforce this demand\r\nby arms. The Russian Government proposed that the question should be\r\nsettled by a Conference of the Powers at London. This proposal was accepted\r\nunder certain conditions by France and Prussia, and the Conference\r\nassembled on the 7th of May. Its deliberations were completed in four days,\r\nand the results were summed up in the Treaty of London signed on the 11th.\r\nBy this Treaty the Duchy of Luxemburg was declared neutral territory under\r\nthe collective guarantee of the Powers. Prussia withdrew its garrison, and\r\nthe King of Holland, who continued to be sovereign of the Duchy, undertook\r\nto demolish the fortifications of Luxemburg, and to maintain it in the\r\nfuture as an open town. [531]\r\n\r\n[Exasperation in France against Prussia.]\r\n\r\nOf the politicians of France, those who even affected to regard the\r\naggrandisement of Prussia and the union of Northern Germany with\r\nindifference or satisfaction were a small minority. Among these was the\r\nEmperor, who, after his attempts to gain a Rhenish Province had been\r\nbaffled, sought to prove in an elaborate State-paper that France had won\r\nmore than it had lost by the extinction of the German Federation as\r\nestablished in 1815, and by the dissolution of the tie that had bound\r\nAustria and Prussia together as members of this body. The events of 1866\r\nhad, he contended, broken up a system devised in evil days for the purpose\r\nof uniting Central Europe against France, and had restored to the Continent\r\nthe freedom of alliances; in other words, they had made it possible for the\r\nSouth German States to connect themselves with France. If this illusion was\r\nreally entertained by the Emperor, it was rudely dispelled by the discovery\r\nof the Treaties between Prussia and the Southern States and by their\r\npublication in the spring of 1867. But this revelation was not necessary to\r\ndetermine the attitude of the great majority of those who passed for the\r\nrepresentatives of independent political opinion in France. The Ministers\r\nindeed were still compelled to imitate the Emperor's optimism, and a few\r\nenlightened men among the Opposition understood that France must be content\r\nto see the Germans effect their national unity; but the great body of\r\nunofficial politicians, to whatever party they belonged, joined in the\r\nbitter outcry raised at once against the aggressive Government of Prussia\r\nand the feeble administration at Paris, which had not found the means to\r\nprevent, or had actually facilitated, Prussia's successes. Thiers, who more\r\nthan any one man had by his writings popularised the Napoleonic legend and\r\naccustomed the French to consider themselves entitled to a monopoly of\r\nnational greatness on the Rhine, was the severest critic of the Emperor,\r\nthe most zealous denouncer of the work which Bismarck had effected. It was\r\nonly with too much reason that the Prussian Government looked forward to an\r\nattack by France at some earlier or later time as almost certain, and\r\npressed forward the military organisation which was to give to Germany an\r\narmy of unheard-of efficiency and strength.\r\n\r\n[France and Prussia after 1867.]\r\n\r\nThere appears to be no evidence that Napoleon III. himself desired to\r\nattack Prussia so long as that Power should strictly observe the\r\nstipulations of the Treaty of Prague which provided for the independence of\r\nthe South German States. But the current of events irresistibly impelled\r\nGermany to unity. The very Treaty which made the river Main the limit of\r\nthe North German Confederacy reserved for the Southern States the right of\r\nattaching themselves to those of the North by some kind of national tie.\r\nUnless the French Emperor was resolved to acquiesce in the gradual\r\ndevelopment of this federal unity until, as regarded the foreigner, the\r\nNorth and the South of Germany should be a single body, he could have no\r\nconfident hope of lasting peace. To have thus anticipated and accepted the\r\nfuture, to have removed once and for all the sleepless fears of Prussia by\r\nthe frank recognition of its right to give all Germany effective Union,\r\nwould have been an act too great and too wise in reality, too weak and\r\nself-renouncing in appearance, for any chief of a rival nation. Napoleon\r\ndid not take this course; on the other hand, not desiring to attack Prussia\r\nwhile it remained within the limits of the Treaty of Prague, he refrained\r\nfrom seeking alliances with the object of immediate and aggressive action.\r\nThe diplomacy of the Emperor during the period from 1866 to 1870 is indeed\r\nstill but imperfectly known; but it would appear that his efforts were\r\ndirected only to the formation of alliances with the view of eventual\r\naction when Prussia should have passed the limits which the Emperor himself\r\nor public opinion in Paris should, as interpreter of the Treaty of Prague,\r\nimpose upon this Power in its dealings with the South German States.\r\n\r\n[Negotiations with Austria, 1868-69.]\r\n\r\nThe Governments to which Napoleon could look for some degree of support\r\nwere those of Austria and Italy. Count Beust, now Chancellor of the\r\nAustrian Monarchy, was a bitter enemy to Prussia, and a rash and\r\nadventurous politician, to whom the very circumstance of his sudden\r\nelevation from the petty sphere of Saxon politics gave a certain levity and\r\nunconstraint in the handling of great affairs. He cherished the idea of\r\nrecovering Austria's ascendency in Germany, and was disposed to repel the\r\nextension of Russian influence westwards by boldly encouraging the Poles to\r\nseek for the satisfaction of their national hopes in Galicia under the\r\nHapsburg Crown. To Count Beust France was the most natural of all allies.\r\nOn the other hand, the very system which Beust had helped to establish in\r\nHungary raised serious obstacles against the adoption of his own policy.\r\nAndrássy, the Hungarian Minister, while sharing Beust's hostility to\r\nRussia, declared that his countrymen had no interest in restoring Austria's\r\nGerman connection, and were in fact better without it. In these\r\ncircumstances the negotiations of the French and the Austrian Emperor were\r\nconducted by a private correspondence. The interchange of letters continued\r\nduring the years 1868 and 1869, and resulted in a promise made by Napoleon\r\nto support Austria if it should be attacked by Prussia, while the Emperor\r\nFrancis Joseph promised to assist France if it should be attacked by\r\nPrussia and Russia together. No Treaty was made, but a general assurance\r\nwas exchanged between the two Emperors that they would pursue a common\r\npolicy and treat one another's interests as their own. With the view of\r\nforming a closer understanding the Archduke Albrecht visited Paris in\r\nFebruary, 1870, and a French general was sent to Vienna to arrange the plan\r\nof campaign in case of war with Prussia. In such a war, if undertaken by\r\nthe two Powers, it was hoped that Italy would join. [532]\r\n\r\n[Italy after 1866.]\r\n\r\n[Mentana, Nov. 3, 1867.]\r\n\r\nThe alliance of 1866 between Prussia and Italy had left behind it in each\r\nof these States more of rancour than of good-will. La Marmora had from the\r\nbeginning to the end been unfortunate in his relations with Berlin. He had\r\nentered into the alliance with suspicion; he would gladly have seen Venetia\r\ngiven to Italy by a European Congress without war; and when hostilities\r\nbroke out, he had disregarded and resented what he considered an attempt of\r\nthe Prussian Government to dictate to him the military measures to be\r\npursued. On the other hand, the Prussians charged the Italian Government\r\nwith having deliberately held back its troops after the battle of Custozza\r\nin pursuance of arrangements made between Napoleon and the Austrian Emperor\r\non the voluntary cession of Venice, and with having endangered or minimised\r\nPrussia's success by enabling the Austrians to throw a great part of their\r\nItalian forces northwards. There was nothing of that comradeship between\r\nthe Italian and the Prussian armies which is acquired on the field of\r\nbattle. The personal sympathies of Victor Emmanuel were strongly on the\r\nside of the French Emperor; and when, at the close of the year 1866, the\r\nFrench garrison was withdrawn from Rome in pursuance of the convention made\r\nin September, 1864, it seemed probable that France and Italy might soon\r\nunite in a close alliance. But in the following year the attempts of the\r\nGaribaldians to overthrow the Papal Government, now left without its\r\nforeign defenders, embroiled Napoleon and the Italian people. Napoleon was\r\nunable to defy the clerical party in France; he adopted the language of\r\nmenace in his communications with the Italian Cabinet; and when, in the\r\nautumn of 1867, the Garibaldians actually invaded the Roman States, he\r\ndespatched a body of French troops under General Failly to act in support\r\nof those of the Pope. An encounter took place at Mentana on November 3rd,\r\nin which the Garibaldians, after defeating the Papal forces, were put to\r\nthe rout by General Failly. The occupation of Civita Vecchia was renewed,\r\nand in the course of the debates raised at Paris on the Italian policy of\r\nthe Government, the Prime Minister, M. Rouher, stated, with the most\r\npassionate emphasis that, come what might, Italy should never possess\r\nitself of Rome. \"Never,\" he cried, \"will France tolerate such an outrage on\r\nits honour and its dignity.\" [533]\r\n\r\n[Napoleon and Italy after Mentana.]\r\n\r\n[Italy and Austria.]\r\n\r\nThe affair of Mentana, the insolent and heartless language in which General\r\nFailly announced his success, the reoccupation of Roman territory by French\r\ntroops, and the declaration made by M. Rouher in the French Assembly,\r\ncreated wide and deep anger in Italy, and made an end for the time of all\r\npossibility of a French alliance. Napoleon was indeed, as regarded Italy,\r\nin an evil case. By abandoning Rome he would have turned against himself\r\nand his dynasty the whole clerical interest in France, whose confidence he\r\nhad already to some extent forfeited by his policy in 1860; on the other\r\nhand, it was vain for him to hope for the friendship of Italy whilst he\r\ncontinued to bar the way to the fulfilment of the universal national\r\ndesire. With the view of arriving at some compromise he proposed a European\r\nConference on the Roman question; but this was resisted above all by Count\r\nBismarck, whose interest it was to keep the sore open; and neither England\r\nnor Russia showed any anxiety to help the Pope's protector out of his\r\ndifficulties. Napoleon sought by a correspondence with Victor Emmanuel\r\nduring 1868 and 1869 to pave the way for a defensive alliance; but Victor\r\nEmmanuel was in reality as well as in name a constitutional king, and\r\nprobably could not, even if he had desired, have committed Italy to\r\nengagements disapproved by the Ministry and Parliament. It was made clear\r\nto Napoleon that the evacuation of the Papal States must precede any treaty\r\nof alliance between France and Italy. Whether the Italian Government would\r\nhave been content with a return to the conditions of the September\r\nConvention, or whether it made the actual possession of Rome the price of a\r\ntreaty-engagement, is uncertain; but inasmuch as Napoleon was not at\r\npresent prepared to evacuate Civita Vecchia, he could aim at nothing more\r\nthan some eventual concert when the existing difficulties should have been\r\nremoved. The Court of Vienna now became the intermediary between the two\r\nPowers who had united against it in 1859. Count Beust was free from the\r\nassociations which had made any approach to friendship with the kingdom of\r\nVictor Emmanuel impossible for his predecessors. He entered into\r\nnegotiations at Florence, which resulted in the conclusion of an agreement\r\nbetween the Austrian and the Italian Governments that they would act\r\ntogether and guarantee one another's territories in the event of a war\r\nbetween France and Prussia. This agreement was made with the assent of the\r\nEmperor Napoleon, and was understood to be preparatory to an accord with\r\nFrance itself; but it was limited to a defensive character, and it implied\r\nthat any eventual concert with France must be arranged by the two Powers in\r\ncombination with one another. [534]\r\n\r\n[Isolation of France.]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1870 the Emperor Napoleon was therefore without any\r\nmore definite assurance of support in a war with Prussia than the promise\r\nof the Austrian Sovereign that he would assist France if attacked by\r\nPrussia and Russia together, and that he would treat the interests of\r\nFrance as his own. By withdrawing his protection from Rome Napoleon had\r\nundoubtedly a fair chance of building up this shadowy and remote engagement\r\ninto a defensive alliance with both Austria and Italy. But perfect\r\nclearness and resolution of purpose, as well as the steady avoidance of all\r\nquarrels on mere incidents, were absolutely indispensable to the creation\r\nand the employment of such a league against the Power which alone it could\r\nhave in view; and Prussia had now little reason to fear any such exercise\r\nof statesmanship on the part of Napoleon. The solution of the Roman\r\nquestion, in other words the withdrawal of the French garrison from Roman\r\nterritory, could proceed only from some stronger stimulus than the\r\ndeclining force of Napoleon's own intelligence and will could now supply.\r\nThis fatal problem baffled his attempts to gain alliances; and yet the\r\nisolation of France was but half acknowledged, but half understood; and a\r\nhost of rash, vainglorious spirits impatiently awaited the hour that should\r\ncall them to their revenge on Prussia for the triumphs in which it had not\r\npermitted France to share.\r\n\r\n[Germany, 1867-1870.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile on the other side Count Bismarck advanced with what was most\r\nessential in his relations with the States of Southern Germany--the\r\ncompletion of the Treaties of Alliance by conventions assimilating the\r\nmilitary systems of these States to that of Prussia. A Customs-Parliament\r\nwas established for the whole of Germany, which, it was hoped, would be the\r\nprecursor of a National Assembly uniting the North and the South of the\r\nMain. But in spite of this military and commercial approximation, the\r\nprogress towards union was neither so rapid nor so smooth as the patriots\r\nof the North could desire. There was much in the harshness and\r\nself-assertion of the Prussian character that repelled the less disciplined\r\ncommunities of the South. Ultramontanism was strong in Bavaria; and\r\nthroughout the minor States the most advanced of the Liberals were opposed\r\nto a closer union with Berlin, from dislike of its absolutist traditions\r\nand the heavy hand of its Government. Thus the tendency known as\r\nParticularism was supported in Bavaria and Würtemberg by classes of the\r\npopulation who in most respects were in antagonism to one another; nor\r\ncould the memories of the campaign of 1866 and the old regard for Austria\r\nbe obliterated in a day. Bismarck did not unduly press on the work of\r\nconsolidation. He marked and estimated the force of the obstacles which too\r\nrapid a development of his national policy would encounter. It is possible\r\nthat he may even have seen indications that religious and other influences\r\nmight imperil the military union which he had already established, and that\r\nhe may not have been unwilling to call to his aid, as the surest of all\r\npreparatives for national union, the event which he had long believed to be\r\ninevitable at some time or other in the future, a war with France.\r\n\r\n[The Spanish candidature of Leopold of Hohenzollern.]\r\n\r\n[Leopold accepts the Spanish Crown, July 3, 1870.]\r\n\r\nSince the autumn of 1868 the throne of Spain had been vacant in consequence\r\nof a revolution in which General Prim had been the leading actor. It was\r\nnot easy to discover a successor for the Bourbon Isabella; and after other\r\ncandidatures had been vainly projected it occurred to Prim and his friends\r\nearly in 1869 that a suitable candidate might be found in Prince Leopold of\r\nHohenzollern-Sigmaringen, whose elder brother had been made Prince of\r\nRoumania, and whose father, Prince Antony, had been Prime Minister of\r\nPrussia in 1859. The House of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen was so distantly\r\nrelated to the reigning family of Prussia that the name alone preserved the\r\nmemory of the connection; and in actual blood-relationship Prince Leopold\r\nwas much more nearly allied to the French Houses of Murat and Beauharnais.\r\nBut the Sigmaringen family was distinctly Prussian by interest and\r\nassociation, and its chief, Antony, had not only been at the head of the\r\nPrussian Administration himself, but had, it is said, been the first to\r\nsuggest the appointment of Bismarck to the same office. The candidature of\r\na Hohenzollern might reasonably be viewed in France as an attempt to\r\nconnect Prussia politically with Spain; and with so much reserve was this\r\ncandidature at the first handled at Berlin that, in answer to inquiries\r\nmade by Benedetti in the spring of 1869, the Secretary of State who\r\nrepresented Count Bismarck stated on his word of honour that the\r\ncandidature had never been suggested. The affair was from first to last\r\nostensibly treated at Berlin as one with which the Prussian Government was\r\nwholly unconcerned, and in which King William was interested only as head\r\nof the family to which Prince Leopold belonged. For twelve months after\r\nBenedetti's inquiries it appeared as if the project had been entirely\r\nabandoned; it was, however, revived in the spring of 1870, and on the 3rd\r\nof July the announcement was made at Paris that Prince Leopold had\r\nconsented to accept the Crown of Spain if the Cortes should confirm his\r\nelection.\r\n\r\n[French Declaration, July 6.]\r\n\r\nAt once there broke out in the French Press a storm of indignation against\r\nPrussia. The organs of the Government took the lead in exciting public\r\nopinion. On the 6th of July the Duke of Gramont, Foreign Minister, declared\r\nto the Legislative Body that the attempt of a Foreign Power to place one of\r\nits Princes on the throne of Charles V. imperilled the interests and the\r\nhonour of France, and that, if such a contingency were realised, the\r\nGovernment would fulfil its duty without hesitation and without weakness.\r\nThe violent and unsparing language of this declaration, which had been\r\ndrawn up at a Council of Ministers under the Emperor's presidency, proved\r\nthat the Cabinet had determined either to humiliate Prussia or to take\r\nvengeance by arms. It was at once seen by foreign diplomatists, who during\r\nthe preceding days had been disposed to assist in removing a reasonable\r\nsubject of complaint, how little was the chance of any peaceable settlement\r\nafter such a public challenge had been issued to Prussia in the Emperor's\r\nname. One means of averting war alone seemed possible, the voluntary\r\nrenunciation by Prince Leopold of the offered Crown. To obtain this\r\nrenunciation became the task of those who, unlike the French Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs, were anxious to preserve peace.\r\n\r\n[Ollivier's Ministry.]\r\n\r\nThe parts that were played at this crisis by the individuals who most\r\ninfluenced the Emperor Napoleon are still but imperfectly known; but there\r\nis no doubt that from the beginning to the end the Duke of Gramont, with\r\nshort intermissions, pressed with insane ardour for war. The Ministry now\r\nin office had been called to their places in January, 1870, after the\r\nEmperor had made certain changes in the constitution in a Liberal\r\ndirection, and had professed to transfer the responsibility of power from\r\nhimself to a body of advisers possessing the confidence of the Chamber.\r\nOllivier, formerly one of the leaders of the Opposition, had accepted the\r\nPresidency of the Cabinet. His colleagues were for the most part men new to\r\nofficial life, and little able to hold their own against such\r\nrepresentatives of unreformed Imperialism as the Duke of Gramont and the\r\nWar-Minister Leboeuf who sat beside them. Ollivier himself was one of the\r\nfew politicians in France who understood that his countrymen must be\r\ncontent to see German unity established whether they liked it or not. He\r\nwas entirely averse from war with Prussia on the question which had now\r\narisen; but the fear that public opinion would sweep away a Liberal\r\nMinistry which hesitated to go all lengths in patriotic extravagance led\r\nhim to sacrifice his own better judgment, and to accept the responsibility\r\nfor a policy which in his heart he disapproved. Gramont's rash hand was\r\ngiven free play. Instructions were sent to Benedetti to seek the King of\r\nPrussia at Ems, where he was taking the waters, and to demand from him, as\r\nthe only means of averting war, that he should order the Hohenzollern\r\nPrince to revoke his acceptance of the Crown. \"We are in great haste,\"\r\nGramont added, \"for we must gain the start in case of an unsatisfactory\r\nreply, and commence the movement of troops by Saturday in order to enter\r\nupon the campaign in a fortnight. Be on your guard against an answer merely\r\nleaving the Prince of Hohenzollern to his fate, and disclaiming on the part\r\nof the King any interest in his future.\" [535]\r\n\r\n[Benedetti and King William at Ems, July 9-14.]\r\n\r\nBenedetti's first interview with the King was on the 9th of July. He\r\ninformed the King of the emotion that had been caused in France by the\r\ncandidature of the Hohenzollern Prince; he dwelt on the value to both\r\ncountries of the friendly relation between France and Prussia; and, while\r\nstudiously avoiding language that might wound or irritate the King, he\r\nexplained to him the requirements of the Government at Paris. The King had\r\nlearnt beforehand what would be the substance of Benedetti's communication.\r\nHe had probably been surprised and grieved at the serious consequences\r\nwhich Prince Leopold's action had produced in France; and although he had\r\ndetermined not to submit to dictation from Paris or to order Leopold to\r\nabandon his candidature, he had already, as it seems, taken steps likely to\r\nrender the preservation of peace more probable. At the end of a\r\nconversation with the Ambassador, in which he asserted his complete\r\nindependence as head of the family of Hohenzollern, he informed Benedetti\r\nthat he had entered into communication with Leopold and his father, and\r\nthat he expected shortly to receive a despatch from Sigmaringen. Benedetti\r\nrightly judged that the King, while positively refusing to meet Gramont's\r\ndemands, was yet desirous of finding some peaceable way out of the\r\ndifficulty; and the report of this interview which he sent to Paris was\r\nreally a plea in favour of good sense and moderation. But Gramont was\r\nlittle disposed to accept such counsels. \"I tell you plainly,\" he wrote to\r\nBenedetti on the next day, \"public opinion is on fire, and will leave us\r\nbehind it. We must begin; we wait only for your despatch to call up the\r\nthree hundred thousand men who are waiting the summons. Write, telegraph,\r\nsomething definite. If the King will not counsel the Prince of Hohenzollern\r\nto resign, well, it is immediate war, and in a few days we are on the\r\nRhine.\"\r\n\r\n[Leopold withdraws, July 12.]\r\n\r\n[Guarantee against renewal demanded.]\r\n\r\n[Benedetti and the King, July 13.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless Benedetti's advice was not without its influence on the\r\nEmperor and his Ministers. Napoleon, himself wavering from hour to hour,\r\nnow inclined to the peace-party, and during the 11th there was a pause in\r\nthe military preparations that had been begun. On the 12th the efforts of\r\ndisinterested Governments, probably also the suggestions of the King of\r\nPrussia himself, produced their effects. A telegram was received at Madrid\r\nfrom Prince Antony stating that his son's candidature was withdrawn. A few\r\nhours later Ollivier announced the news in the Legislative Chamber at\r\nParis, and exchanged congratulations with the friends of peace, who\r\nconsidered that the matter was now at an end. But this pacific conclusion\r\nlittle suited either the war-party or the Bonapartists of the old type, who\r\ngrudged to a Constitutional Ministry so substantial a diplomatic success.\r\nThey at once declared that the retirement of Prince Leopold was a secondary\r\nmatter, and that the real question was what guarantees had been received\r\nfrom Prussia against a renewal of the candidature. Gramont himself, in an\r\ninterview with the Prussian Ambassador, Baron Werther, sketched a letter\r\nwhich he proposed that King William should send to the Emperor, stating\r\nthat in sanctioning the candidature of Prince Leopold he had not intended\r\nto offend the French, and that in associating himself with the Prince's\r\nwithdrawal he desired that all misunderstandings should be at an end\r\nbetween the two Governments. The despatch of Baron Werther conveying this\r\nproposition appears to have deeply offended King William, whom it reached\r\nabout midday on the 13th. Benedetti had that morning met the King on the\r\npromenade at Ems, and had received from him the promise that as soon as the\r\nletter which was still on its way from Sigmaringen should arrive he would\r\nsend for the Ambassador in order that he might communicate its contents at\r\nParis. The letter arrived; but Baron Werther's despatch from Paris had\r\narrived before it; and instead of summoning Benedetti as he had promised,\r\nthe King sent one of his aides-de-camp to him with a message that a written\r\ncommunication had been received from Prince Leopold confirming his\r\nwithdrawal, and that the matter was now at an end. Benedetti desired the\r\naide-de-camp to inform the King that he was compelled by his instructions\r\nto ask for a guarantee against a renewal of the candidature. The\r\naide-de-camp did as he was requested, and brought back a message that the\r\nKing gave his entire approbation to the withdrawal of the Prince of\r\nHohenzollern, but that he could do no more. Benedetti begged for an\r\naudience with His Majesty. The King replied that he was compelled to\r\ndecline entering into further negotiation, and that he had said his last\r\nword. Though the King thus refused any further discussion, perfect courtesy\r\nwas observed on both sides; and on the following morning the King and the\r\nAmbassador, who were both leaving Ems, took leave of one another at the\r\nrailway station with the usual marks of respect.\r\n\r\n[Publication of the telegram from Ems, July 13.]\r\n\r\n[War decided at Paris, July 14.]\r\n\r\nThat the guarantee which the French Government had resolved to demand would\r\nnot be given was now perfectly certain; yet, with the candidature of Prince\r\nLeopold fairly extinguished, it was still possible that the cooler heads at\r\nParis might carry the day, and that the Government would stop short of\r\ndeclaring war on a point on which the unanimous judgment of the other\r\nPowers declared it to be in the wrong. But Count Bismarck was determined\r\nnot to let the French escape lightly from the quarrel. He had to do with an\r\nenemy who by his own folly had come to the brink of an aggressive war, and,\r\nfar from facilitating his retreat, it was Bismarck's policy to lure him\r\nover the precipice. Not many hours after the last message had passed\r\nbetween King William and Benedetti, a telegram was officially published at\r\nBerlin, stating, in terms so brief as to convey the impression of an actual\r\ninsult, that the King had refused to see the French Ambassador, and had\r\ninformed him by an aide-de-camp that he had nothing more to communicate to\r\nhim. This telegram was sent to the representatives of Prussia at most of\r\nthe European Courts, and to its agents in every German capital. Narratives\r\ninstantly gained currency, and were not contradicted by the Prussian\r\nGovernment, that Benedetti had forced himself upon the King on the\r\npromenade at Ems, and that in the presence of a large company the King had\r\nturned his back upon the Ambassador. The publication of the alleged\r\ntelegram from Ems became known in Paris on the 14th. On that day the\r\nCouncil of Ministers met three times. At the first meeting the advocates of\r\npeace were still in the majority; in the afternoon, as the news from Berlin\r\nand the fictions describing the insult offered to the French Ambassador\r\nspread abroad, the agitation in Paris deepened, and the Council decided\r\nupon calling up the Reserves; yet the Emperor himself seemed still disposed\r\nfor peace. It was in the interval between the second and the third meeting\r\nof the Council, between the hours of six and ten in the evening, that\r\nNapoleon finally gave way before the threats and importunities of the\r\nwar-party. The Empress, fanatically anxious for the overthrow of a great\r\nProtestant Power, passionately eager for the military glory which alone\r\ncould insure the Crown to her son, won the triumph which she was so\r\nbitterly to rue. At the third meeting of the Council, held shortly before\r\nmidnight, the vote was given for war.\r\n\r\nIn Germany this decision had been expected; yet it made a deep impression\r\nnot only on the German people but on Europe at large that, when the\r\ndeclaration of war was submitted to the French Legislative Body in the form\r\nof a demand for supplies, no single voice was raised to condemn the war for\r\nits criminality and injustice: the arguments which were urged against it by\r\nM. Thiers and others were that the Government had fixed upon a bad cause,\r\nand that the occasion was inopportune. Whether the majority of the Assembly\r\nreally desired war is even now matter of doubt. But the clamour of a\r\nhundred madmen within its walls, the ravings of journalists and\r\nincendiaries, who at such a time are to the true expression of public\r\nopinion what the Spanish Inquisition was to the Christian religion,\r\nparalysed the will and the understanding of less infatuated men. Ten votes\r\nalone were given in the Assembly against the grant demanded for war; to\r\nEurope at large it went out that the crime and the madness was that of\r\nFrance as a nation. Yet Ollivier and many of his colleagues up to the last\r\nmoment disapproved of the war, and consented to it only because they\r\nbelieved that the nation would otherwise rush into hostilities under a\r\nreactionary Ministry who would serve France worse than themselves. They\r\nfound when it was too late that the supposed national impulse, which they\r\nhad thought irresistible, was but the outcry of a noisy minority. The\r\nreports of their own officers informed them that in sixteen alone out of\r\nthe eighty-seven Departments of France was the war popular. In the other\r\nseventy-one it was accepted either with hesitation or regret. [536]\r\n\r\n[Initial forces of either side.]\r\n\r\n[Expected Alliances of France.]\r\n\r\n[Austria preparing.]\r\n\r\nHow vast were the forces which the North German Confederation could bring\r\ninto the field was well known to Napoleon's Government. Benedetti had kept\r\nhis employers thoroughly informed of the progress of the North German\r\nmilitary organisation; he had warned them that the South German States\r\nwould most certainly act with the North against a foreign assailant; he had\r\ndescribed with great accuracy and great penetration the nature of the tie\r\nthat existed between Berlin and St. Petersburg, a tie which was close\r\nenough to secure for Prussia the goodwill, and in certain contingencies the\r\narmed support, of Russia, while it was loose enough not to involve Prussia\r\nin any Muscovite enterprise that would bring upon it the hostility of\r\nEngland and Austria. The utmost force which the French military\r\nadministration reckoned on placing in the field at the beginning of the\r\ncampaign was two hundred and fifty thousand men, to be raised at the end of\r\nthree weeks by about fifty thousand more. The Prussians, even without\r\nreckoning on any assistance from Southern Germany, and after allowing for\r\nthree army-corps that might be needed to watch Austria and Denmark, could\r\nbegin the campaign with three hundred and thirty thousand. Army to army,\r\nthe French thus stood according to the reckoning of their own War Office\r\noutnumbered at the outset; but Leboeuf, the War-Minister, imagined that the\r\nForeign Office had made sure of alliances, and that a great part of the\r\nPrussian Army would not be free to act on the western frontier. Napoleon\r\nhad in fact pushed forward his negotiations with Austria and Italy from the\r\ntime that war became imminent. Count Beust, while clearly laying it down\r\nthat Austria was not bound to follow France into a war made at its own\r\npleasure, nevertheless felt some anxiety lest France and Prussia should\r\nsettle their differences at Austria's expense; moreover from the victory of\r\nNapoleon, assisted in any degree by himself, he could fairly hope for the\r\nrestoration of Austria's ascendency in Germany and the undoing of the work\r\nof 1866. It was determined at a Council held at Vienna on the 18th of July\r\nthat Austria should for the present be neutral if Russia should not enter\r\nthe war on the side of Prussia; but this neutrality was nothing more than a\r\nstage towards alliance with France if at the end of a certain brief period\r\nthe army of Napoleon should have penetrated into Southern Germany. In a\r\nprivate despatch to the Austrian Ambassador at Paris Count Beust pointed\r\nout that the immediate participation of Austria in the war would bring\r\nRussia into the field on King William's side. \"To keep Russia neutral,\" he\r\nwrote, \"till the season is sufficiently advanced to prevent the\r\nconcentration of its troops must be at present our object; but this\r\nneutrality is nothing more than a means for arriving at the real end of our\r\npolicy, the only means for completing our preparations without exposing\r\nourselves to premature attack by Prussia or Russia.\" He added that Austria\r\nhad already entered into a negotiation with Italy with a view to the armed\r\nmediation of the two Powers, and strongly recommended the Emperor to place\r\nthe Italians in possession of Rome. [537]\r\n\r\n[France, Austria, and Italy.]\r\n\r\nNegotiations were now pressed forward between Paris, Florence, and Vienna,\r\nfor the conclusion of a triple alliance. Of the course taken by these\r\nnegotiations contradictory accounts are given by the persons concerned in\r\nthem. According to Prince Napoleon, Victor Emmanuel demanded possession of\r\nRome and this was refused to him by the French Emperor, in consequence of\r\nwhich the project of alliance failed. According to the Duke of Gramont, no\r\nmore was demanded by Italy than the return to the conditions of the\r\nSeptember Convention; this was agreed to by the Emperor, and it was in\r\npursuance of this agreement that the Papal States were evacuated by their\r\nFrench garrison on the 2nd of August. Throughout the last fortnight of\r\nJuly, after war had actually been declared, there was, if the statement of\r\nGramont is to be trusted, a continuous interchange of notes, projects, and\r\ntelegrams between the three Governments. The difficulties raised by Italy\r\nand Austria were speedily removed, and though some weeks were needed by\r\nthese Powers for their military preparations, Napoleon was definitely\r\nassured of their armed support in case of his preliminary success. It was\r\nagreed that Austria and Italy, assuming at the first the position of armed\r\nneutrality, should jointly present an ultimatum to Prussia in September\r\ndemanding the exact performance of the Treaty of Prague, and, failing its\r\ncompliance with this summons in the sense understood by its enemies, that\r\nthe two Powers would immediately declare war, their armies taking the field\r\nat latest on the 15th of September. That Russia would in that case assist\r\nPrussia was well known; but it would seem that Count Beust feared little\r\nfrom his northern enemy in an autumn campaign. The draft of the Treaty\r\nbetween Italy and Austria had actually, according to Gramont's statement,\r\nbeen accepted by the two latter Powers, and received its last amendments in\r\na negotiation between the Emperor Napoleon and an Italian envoy, Count\r\nVimercati, at Metz. Vimercati reached Florence with the amended draft on\r\nthe 4th of August, and it was expected that the Treaty would be signed on\r\nthe following day. When that day came it saw the forces of the French\r\nEmpire dashed to pieces. [538]\r\n\r\n[Prussian Plans.]\r\n\r\nPreparations for a war with France had long occupied the general staff at\r\nBerlin. Before the winter of 1868 a memoir had been drawn up by General\r\nMoltke, containing plans for the concentration of the whole of the German\r\nforces, for the formation of each of the armies to be employed, and the\r\npositions to be occupied at the outset by each corps. On the basis of this\r\nmemoir the arrangements for the transport of each corps from its depôt to\r\nthe frontier had subsequently been worked out in such minute detail that\r\nwhen, on the 16th of July, King William gave the order for mobilisation,\r\nnothing remained but to insert in the railway time-tables and\r\nmarching-orders the day on which the movement was to commence. This\r\nminuteness of detail extended, however, only to that part of Moltke's plan\r\nwhich related to the assembling and first placing of the troops. The events\r\nof the campaign could not thus be arranged and tabulated beforehand; only\r\nthe general object and design could be laid down. That the French would\r\nthrow themselves with great rapidity upon Southern Germany was considered\r\nprobable. The armies of Baden, Würtemberg, and Bavaria were too weak, the\r\nmilitary centres of the North were too far distant, for effective\r\nresistance to be made in this quarter to the first blows of the invader.\r\nMoltke therefore recommended that the Southern troops should withdraw from\r\ntheir own States and move northwards to join those of Prussia in the\r\nPalatinate or on the Middle Rhine, so that the entire forces of Germany\r\nshould be thrown upon the flank or rear of the invader; while, in the event\r\nof the French not thus taking the offensive, France itself was to be\r\ninvaded by the collective strength of Germany along the line from\r\nSaarbrücken to Landau, and its armies were to be cut off from their\r\ncommunications with Paris by vigorous movements of the invader in a\r\nnortherly direction. [539]\r\n\r\n[German mobilisation.]\r\n\r\nThe military organisation of Germany is based on the division of the\r\ncountry into districts, each of which furnishes at its own depôt a small\r\nbut complete army. The nucleus of each such corps exists in time of peace,\r\nwith its own independent artillery, stores, and material of war. On the\r\norder for mobilisation being given, every man liable to military service,\r\nbut not actually serving, joins the regiment to which he locally belongs,\r\nand in a given number of days each corps is ready to take the field in full\r\nstrength. The completion of each corps at its own depôt is the first stage\r\nin the preparation for a campaign. Not till this is effected does the\r\nmovement of troops towards the frontier begin. The time necessary for the\r\nfirst act of preparation was, like that to be occupied in transport,\r\naccurately determined by the Prussian War Office. It resulted from General\r\nMoltke's calculations that, the order of mobilisation having been given on\r\nthe 16th of July, the entire army with which it was intended to begin the\r\ncampaign would be collected and in position ready to cross the frontier on\r\nthe 4th of August, if the French should not have taken up the offensive\r\nbefore that day. But as it was apprehended that part at least of the French\r\narmy would be thrown into Germany before that date, the westward movement\r\nof the German troops stopped short at a considerable distance from the\r\nborder, in order that the troops first arriving might not be exposed to the\r\nattack of a superior force before their supports should be at hand. On the\r\nactual frontier there was placed only the handful of men required for\r\nreconnoitring, and for checking the enemy during the few hours that would\r\nbe necessary to guard against the effect of a surprise.\r\n\r\n[The French Army.]\r\n\r\nThe French Emperor was aware of the numerical inferiority of his army to\r\nthat of Prussia; he hoped, however, by extreme rapidity of movement to\r\npenetrate Southern Germany before the Prussian army could assemble, and so,\r\nwhile forcing the Southern Governments to neutrality, to meet on the Upper\r\nDanube the assisting forces of Italy and Austria. It was his design to\r\nconcentrate a hundred and fifty thousand men at Metz, a hundred thousand at\r\nStrasburg, and with these armies united to cross the Rhine into Baden;\r\nwhile a third army, which was to assemble at Châlons, protected the\r\nnorth-eastern frontier against an advance of the Prussians. A few days\r\nafter the declaration of war, while the German corps were still at their\r\ndepôts in the interior, considerable forces were massed round Metz and\r\nStrasburg. All Europe listened for the rush of the invader and the first\r\nswift notes of triumph from a French army beyond the Rhine; but week after\r\nweek passed, and the silence was still unbroken. Stories, incredible to\r\nthose who first heard them, yet perfectly true, reached the German\r\nfrontier-stations of actual famine at the advanced posts of the enemy, and\r\nof French soldiers made prisoners while digging in potato-fields to keep\r\nthemselves alive. That Napoleon was less ready than had been anticipated\r\nbecame clear to all the world; but none yet imagined the revelations which\r\neach successive day was bringing at the headquarters of the French armies.\r\nAbsence of whole regiments that figured in the official order of battle,\r\ndefective transport, stores missing or congested, made it impossible even\r\nto attempt the inroad into Southern Germany within the date up to which it\r\nhad any prospect of success. The design was abandoned, yet not in time to\r\nprevent the troops that were hurrying from the interior from being sent\r\nbackwards and forwards according as the authorities had, or had not, heard\r\nof the change of plan. Napoleon saw that a Prussian force was gathering on\r\nthe Middle Rhine which it would be madness to leave on his flank; he\r\nordered his own commanders to operate on the corresponding line of the\r\nLauter and the Saar, and despatched isolated divisions to the very\r\nfrontier, still uncertain whether even in this direction he would be able\r\nto act on the offensive, or whether nothing now remained to him but to\r\nresist the invasion of France by a superior enemy. Ollivier had stated in\r\nthe Assembly that he and his colleagues entered upon the war with a light\r\nheart; he might have added that they entered upon it with bandaged eyes.\r\nThe Ministers seem actually not to have taken the trouble to exchange\r\nexplanations with one another. Leboeuf, the War-Minister, had taken it\r\nfor granted that Gramont had made arrangements with Austria which would\r\ncompel the Prussians to keep a large part of their forces in the interior.\r\nGramont, in forcing on the quarrel with Prussia, and in his negotiations\r\nwith Austria, had taken it for granted that Leboeuf could win a series of\r\nvictories at the outset in Southern Germany. The Emperor, to whom alone the\r\nentire data of the military and the diplomatic services of France were\r\nopen, was incapable of exertion or scrutiny, purposeless, distracted with\r\npain, half-imbecile.\r\n\r\n[Causes of French military inferiority.]\r\n\r\nThat the Imperial military administration was rotten to the core the\r\nterrible events of the next few weeks sufficiently showed. Men were in high\r\nplace whose antecedents would have shamed the better kind of brigand. The\r\ndeficiencies of the army were made worse by the diversion of public funds\r\nto private necessities; the looseness, the vulgar splendour, the base\r\nstandards of judgment of the Imperial Court infected each branch of the\r\npublic services of France, and worked perhaps not least on those who were\r\nin military command. But the catastrophe of 1870 seemed to those who\r\nwitnessed it to tell of more than the vileness of an administration; in\r\nEngland, not less than in Germany, voices of influence spoke of the doom\r\nthat had overtaken the depravity of a sunken nation; of the triumph of\r\nsimple manliness, of Godfearing virtue itself, in the victories of the\r\nGerman army. There may have been truth in this; yet it would require a nice\r\nmoral discernment to appraise the exact degeneracy of the French of 1870\r\nfrom the French of 1854 who humbled Russia, or from the French of 1859 who\r\ntriumphed at Solferino; and it would need a very comprehensive acquaintance\r\nwith the lower forms of human pleasure to judge in what degree the\r\nsinfulness of Paris exceeds the sinfulness of Berlin. Had the French been\r\nas strict a race as the Spartans who fell at Thermopylae, as devout as the\r\nTyrolese who perished at Königgrätz, it is quite certain that, with the\r\nnumbers which took the field against Germany in 1870, with Napoleon III. at\r\nthe head of affairs, and the actual generals of 1870 in command, the armies\r\nof France could not have escaped destruction.\r\n\r\n[Cause of German Success.]\r\n\r\nThe main cause of the disparity of France and Germany in 1870 was in truth\r\nthat Prussia had had from 1862 to 1866 a Government so strong as to be able\r\nto force upon its subjects its own gigantic scheme of military organisation\r\nin defiance of the votes of Parliament and of the national will. In 1866\r\nPrussia, with a population of nineteen millions, brought actually into the\r\nfield three hundred and fifty thousand men, or one in fifty-four of its\r\ninhabitants. There was no other government in Europe, with the possible\r\nexception of Russia, which could have imposed upon its subjects, without\r\nrisking its own existence, so vast a burden of military service as that\r\nimplied in this strength of the fighting army. Napoleon III. at the height\r\nof his power could not have done so; and when after Königgrätz he\r\nendeavoured to raise the forces of France to an equality with those of the\r\nrival Power by a system which would have brought about one in seventy of\r\nthe population into the field, his own nominees in the Legislative Body,\r\nunder pressure of public opinion, so weakened the scheme that the effective\r\nnumbers of the army remained little more than they were before. The true\r\nparallel to the German victories of 1870 is to be found in the victories of\r\nthe French Committee of Public Safety in 1794 and in those of the first\r\nNapoleon. A government so powerful as to bend the entire resources of the\r\nState to military ends will, whether it is one of democracy run mad, or of\r\na crowned soldier of fortune, or of an ancient monarchy throwing new vigour\r\ninto its traditional system and policy, crush in the moment of impact\r\ncommunities of equal or greater resources in which a variety of rival\r\ninfluences limit and control the central power and subordinate military to\r\nother interests. It was so in the triumphs of the Reign of Terror over the\r\nFirst Coalition; it was so in the triumphs of King William over Austria and\r\nFrance. But the parallel between the founders of German unity and the\r\norganisers of victory after 1793 extends no farther than to the sources of\r\ntheir success. Aggression and adventure have not been the sequels of the\r\nwar of 1870. The vast armaments of Prussia were created in order to\r\nestablish German union under the House of Hohenzollern, and they have been\r\nemployed for no other object. It is the triumph of statesmanship, and it\r\nhas been the glory of Prince Bismarck, after thus reaping the fruit of a\r\nwell-timed homage to the God of Battles, to know how to quit his shrine.\r\n\r\n[The frontier, Aug. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Saarbrücken, Aug 2.]\r\n\r\n[Weissenburg, Aug 4.]\r\n\r\n[Battle of Wörth, Aug. 6.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of July, twelve days after the formal declaration of war, the\r\ngathering forces of the Germans, over three hundred and eighty thousand\r\nstrong, were still some distance behind the Lauter and the Saar. Napoleon,\r\napparently without any clear design, had placed certain bodies of troops\r\nactually on the frontier at Forbach, Weissenburg, and elsewhere, while\r\nother troops, raising the whole number to about two hundred and fifty\r\nthousand, lay round Metz and Strasburg, and at points between these and the\r\nmost advanced positions. The reconnoitring of the small German detachments\r\non the frontier was conducted with extreme energy: the French appear to\r\nhave made no reconnaissances at all, for when they determined at last to\r\ndiscover what was facing them at Saarbrücken, they advanced with\r\ntwenty-five thousand men against one-tenth of that number. On the 2nd of\r\nAugust Frossard's corps from Forbach moved upon Saarbrücken with the\r\nEmperor in person. The garrison was driven out, and the town bombarded, but\r\neven now the reconnaissance was not continued beyond the bridge across the\r\nSaar which divides the two parts of the town. Forty-eight hours later the\r\nalignment of the German forces in their invading order was completed, and\r\nall was ready for an offensive campaign. The central army, commanded by\r\nPrince Frederick Charles, spreading east and west behind Saarbrücken,\r\ntouched on its right the northern army commanded by General Steinmetz, on\r\nits left the southern army commanded by the Crown Prince, which covered the\r\nfrontier of the Palatinate, and included the troops of Bavaria and\r\nWürtemberg. The general direction of the three armies was thus from\r\nnorth-west to south-east. As the line of invasion was to be nearly due west,\r\nit was necessary that the first step forwards should be made by the army of\r\nthe Crown Prince in order to bring it more nearly to a level with the\r\nnorthern corps in the march into France. On the 4th of August the Crown\r\nPrince crossed the Alsatian frontier and moved against Weissenburg. The\r\nFrench General Douay, who was posted here with about twelve thousand men,\r\nwas neither reinforced nor bidden to retire. His troops met the attack of\r\nan enemy many times more numerous with great courage; but the struggle was\r\na hopeless one, and after several hours of severe fighting the Germans were\r\nmasters of the field. Douay fell in the battle; his troops frustrated an\r\nattempt made to cut off their retreat, and fell back southwards towards the\r\ncorps of McMahon, which lay about ten miles behind them. The Crown Prince\r\nmarched on in search of his enemy, McMahon, who could collect only\r\nforty-five thousand men, desired to retreat until he could gain some\r\nsupport; but the Emperor, tormented by fears of the political consequences\r\nof the invasion, insisted upon his giving battle. He drew up on the hills\r\nabout Wörth, almost on the spot where in 1793 Hoche had overthrown the\r\narmies of the First Coalition. On the 6th of August the leading divisions\r\nof the Crown Prince, about a hundred thousand strong, were within striking\r\ndistance. The superiority of the Germans in numbers was so great that\r\nMcMahon's army might apparently have been captured or destroyed with far\r\nless loss than actually took place if time had been given for the movements\r\nwhich the Crown Prince's staff had in view, and for the employment of his\r\nfull strength. But the impetuosity of divisional leaders on the morning of\r\nthe 6th brought on a general engagement. The resistance of the French was\r\nof the most determined character. With one more army-corps--and the corps\r\nof General Failly was expected to arrive on the field--it seemed as if the\r\nGermans might yet be beaten back. But each hour brought additional forces\r\ninto action in the attack, while the French commander looked in vain for\r\nthe reinforcements that could save him from ruin. At length, when the last\r\ndesperate charges of the Cuirassiers had shattered against the fire of\r\ncannon and needle-guns, and the village of Froschwiller, the centre of the\r\nFrench position, had been stormed house by house, the entire army broke and\r\nfled in disorder. Nine thousand prisoners, thirty-three cannon, fell into\r\nthe hands of the conquerors. The Germans had lost ten thousand men, but\r\nthey had utterly destroyed McMahon's army as an organised force. Its\r\nremnant disappeared from the scene of warfare, escaping by the western\r\nroads in the direction of Châlons, where first it was restored to some\r\ndegree of order. The Crown Prince, leaving troops behind him to beleaguer\r\nthe smaller Alsatian fortresses, marched on untroubled through the northern\r\nVosges, and descended into the open country about Lunéville and Nancy,\r\nunfortified towns which could offer no resistance to the passage of an\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n[Spicheren, Aug. 6.]\r\n\r\nOn the same day that the battle of Wörth was fought, the leading columns of\r\nthe armies of Steinmetz and Prince Frederick Charles crossed the frontier\r\nat Saarbrücken. Frossard's corps, on the news of the defeat at Weissenburg,\r\nhad withdrawn to its earlier positions between Forbach and the frontier: it\r\nheld the steep hills of Spicheren that look down upon Saarbrücken, and the\r\nwoods that flank the high road where this passes from Germany into France.\r\nAs at Wörth, it was not intended that any general attack should be made on\r\nthe 6th; a delay of twenty-four hours would have enabled the Germans to\r\nenvelop or crush Frossard's corps with an overwhelming force. But the\r\nleaders of the foremost regiments threw themselves impatiently upon the\r\nFrench whom they found before them: other brigades hurried up to the sound\r\nof the cannon, until the struggle took the proportion of a battle, and\r\nafter hours of fluctuating success the heights of Spicheren were carried by\r\nsuccessive rushes of the infantry full in the enemy's fire. Why Frossard\r\nwas not reinforced has never been explained, for several French divisions\r\nlay at no great distance westward, and the position was so strong that, if\r\na pitched battle was to be fought anywhere east of Metz, few better points\r\ncould have been chosen. But, like Douay at Weissenburg, Frossard was left\r\nto struggle alone against whatever forces the Germans might throw upon him.\r\nNapoleon, who directed the operations of the French armies from Metz,\r\nappears to have been now incapable of appreciating the simplest military\r\nnecessities, of guarding against the most obvious dangers. Helplessness,\r\ninfatuation ruled the miserable hours.\r\n\r\n[Paris after Aug. 6.]\r\n\r\nThe impression made upon Europe by the battles of the 6th of August\r\ncorresponded to the greatness of their actual military effects. There was\r\nan end to all thoughts of the alliance of Austria and Italy with France.\r\nGermany, though unaware of the full magnitude of the perils from which it\r\nhad escaped, breathed freely after weeks of painful suspense; the very\r\ncircumstance that the disproportion of numbers on the battle-field of\r\nWörth was still unknown heightened the joy and confidence produced by the\r\nCrown Prince's victory, a victory in which the South German troops,\r\nfighting by the side of those who had been their foes in 1866, had borne\r\ntheir full part. In Paris the consternation with which the news of\r\nMcMahon's overthrow was received was all the greater that on the previous\r\nday reports had been circulated of a victory won at Landau and of the\r\ncapture of the Crown Prince with his army. The bulletin of the Emperor,\r\nbriefly narrating McMahon's defeat and the repulse of Frossard, showed in\r\nits concluding words--\"All may yet be retrieved\"--how profound was the\r\nchange made in the prospects of the war by that fatal day. The truth was\r\nat once apprehended. A storm of indignation broke out against the\r\nImperial Government at Paris. The Chambers were summoned. Ollivier,\r\nattacked alike by the extreme Bonapartists and by the Opposition, laid\r\ndown his office. A reactionary Ministry, headed by the Count of Palikao,\r\nwas placed in power by the Empress, a Ministry of the last hour as it was\r\njustly styled by all outside it. Levies were ordered, arms and stores\r\naccumulated for the reserve-forces, preparations made for a siege of\r\nParis itself. On the 12th the Emperor gave up the command which he had\r\nexercised with such miserable results, and appointed Marshal Bazaine, one\r\nof the heroes of the Mexican Expedition, General-in-Chief of the Army of\r\nthe Rhine.\r\n\r\n[Napoleon at Metz. Aug. 7-11.]\r\n\r\n[Borny, Aug 14.]\r\n\r\nAfter the overthrow of McMahon and the victory of the Germans at Spicheren,\r\nthere seems to have been a period of utter paralysis in the French\r\nheadquarters at Metz. The divisions of Prince Frederick Charles and\r\nSteinmetz did not immediately press forward; it was necessary to allow some\r\ndays for the advance of the Crown Prince through the Vosges; and during\r\nthese days the French army about Metz, which, when concentrated, numbered\r\nnearly two hundred thousand men, might well have taken the positions\r\nnecessary for the defence of Moselle, or in the alternative might have\r\ngained several marches in the retreat towards Verdun and Châlons. Only a\r\nsmall part of this body had as yet been exposed to defeat. It included in\r\nit the very flower of the French forces, tens of thousands of troops\r\nprobably equal to any in Europe, and capable of forming a most formidable\r\narmy if united to the reserves which would shortly be collected at Châlons\r\nor nearer Paris. But from the 7th to the 12th of August Napoleon, too cowed\r\nto take the necessary steps for battle in defence of the line of Moselle,\r\nlingered purposeless a id irresolute at Metz, unwilling to fall back from\r\nthis fortress. It was not till the 14th that the retreat was begun. By this\r\ntime the Germans were close at hand, and their leaders were little disposed\r\nto let the hesitating enemy escape them. While the leading divisions of the\r\nFrench were crossing the Moselle, Steinmetz hurried forward his troops and\r\nfell upon the French detachments still lying on the south-east of Metz\r\nabout Borny and Courcelles. Bazaine suspended his movement of retreat in\r\norder to beat back an assailant who for once seemed to be inferior in\r\nstrength. At the close of the day the French commander believed that he had\r\ngained a victory and driven the Germans off their line of advance; in\r\nreality he had allowed himself to be diverted from the passage of the\r\nMoselle at the last hour, while the Germans left under Prince Frederick\r\nCharles gained the river farther south, and actually began to cross it in\r\norder to bar his retreat.\r\n\r\n[Mars-la-Tour, Aug. 15.]\r\n\r\nFrom Metz westwards there is as far as the village of Gravelotte, which is\r\nseven miles distant, but one direct road; at Gravelotte the road forks, the\r\nsouthern arm leading towards Verdun by Vionville and Mars-la-Tour, the\r\nnorthern by Conflans. During the 15th of August the first of Bazaine's\r\ndivisions moved as far as Vionville along the southern road; others came\r\ninto the neighbourhood of Gravelotte, but two corps which should have\r\nadvanced past Gravelotte on to the northern road still lay close to Metz.\r\nThe Prussian vanguard was meanwhile crossing the Moselle southwards from\r\nNoveant to Pont-a-Mousson, and hurrying forwards by lines converging on the\r\nroad taken by Bazaine. Down to the evening of the 15th it was not supposed\r\nat the Prussian headquarters that Bazaine could be overtaken and brought to\r\nbattle nearer than the line of the Meuse; but on the morning of the 16th\r\nthe cavalry-detachments which had pushed farthest to the north-west\r\ndiscovered that the heads of the French columns had still not passed\r\nMars-la-Tour. An effort was instantly made to seize the road and block the\r\nway before the enemy. The struggle, begun by a handful of combatants on\r\neach side, drew to it regiment after regiment as the French battalions\r\nclose at hand came into action, and the Prussians hurried up in wild haste\r\nto support their comrades who were exposed to the attack of an entire army.\r\nThe rapidity with which the Prussian generals grasped the situation before\r\nthem, the vigour with which they brought up their cavalry over a distance\r\nwhich no infantry could traverse in the necessary time, and without a\r\nmoment's hesitation hurled this cavalry in charge after charge against a\r\nsuperior foe, mark the battle of Mars-la-Tour as that in which the military\r\nsuperiority of the Germans was most truly shown. Numbers in this battle had\r\nlittle to do with the result, for by better generalship Bazaine could\r\ncertainly at any one point have overpowered his enemy. But while the\r\nGermans rushed like a torrent upon the true point of attack--that is the\r\nwesternmost--Bazaine by some delusion considered it his primary object to\r\nprevent the Germans from thrusting themselves between the retreating army\r\nand Metz, and so kept a great part of his troops inactive about the\r\nfortress. The result was that the Germans, with a loss of sixteen thousand\r\nmen, remained at the close of the day masters of the road at Vionville, and\r\nthat the French army could not, without winning a victory and breaking\r\nthrough the enemy's line, resume its retreat along this line.\r\n\r\n[Gravelotte, Aug. 18.]\r\n\r\nIt was expected during the 17th that Bazaine would make some attempt to\r\nescape by the northern road, but instead of doing so he fell back on\r\nGravelotte and the heights between this and Metz, in order to fight a\r\npitched battle. The position was a well-chosen one; but by midday on the\r\n18th the armies of Steinmetz and Prince Frederick Charles were ranged in\r\nfront of Bazaine with a strength of two hundred and fifty thousand men, and\r\nin the judgment of the King these forces were equal to the attack. Again,\r\nas at Wörth, the precipitancy of divisional commanders caused the sacrifice\r\nof whole brigades before the battle was won. While the Saxon corps with\r\nwhich Moltke intended to deliver his slow but fatal blow upon the enemy's\r\nright flank was engaged in its long northward détour, Steinmetz pushed his\r\nRhinelanders past the ravine of Gravelotte into a fire where no human being\r\ncould survive, and the Guards, pressing forward in column over the smooth\r\nunsheltered slope from St. Marie to St. Privat, sank by thousands without\r\nreaching midway in their course. Until the final blow was dealt by the\r\nSaxon corps from the north flank, the ground which was won by the Prussians\r\nwas won principally by their destructive artillery fire: their infantry\r\nattacks had on the whole been repelled, and at Gravelotte itself it had\r\nseemed for a moment as if the French were about to break the assailant's\r\nline. But Bazaine, as on the 16th, steadily kept his reserves at a distance\r\nfrom the points where their presence was most required, and, according to\r\nhis own account, succeeded in bringing into action no more than a hundred\r\nthousand men, or less than two-thirds of the forces under his command.\r\n[540] At the close of the awful day, when the capture of St. Privat by the\r\nSaxons turned the defender's line, the French abandoned all their positions\r\nand drew back within the defences of Metz.\r\n\r\n[McMahon is compelled to attempt Bazaine's relief.]\r\n\r\nThe Germans at once proceeded to block all the roads round the fortress,\r\nand Bazaine made no effort to prevent them. At the end of a few days the\r\nline was drawn around him in sufficient strength to resist any sudden\r\nattack. Steinmetz, who was responsible for a great part of the loss\r\nsustained at Gravelotte, was now removed from his command; his army was\r\nunited with that under Prince Frederick Charles as the besieging force,\r\nwhile sixty thousand men, detached from this great mass, were formed into a\r\nseparate army under Prince Albert of Saxony, and sent by way of Verdun to\r\nco-operate with the Crown Prince against McMahon. The Government at Paris\r\nknew but imperfectly what was passing around Metz from day to day; it knew,\r\nhowever, that if Metz should be given up for lost the hour of its own fall\r\ncould not be averted. One forlorn hope remained, to throw the army which\r\nMcMahon was gathering at Châlons north-eastward to Bazaine's relief, though\r\nthe Crown Prince stood between Châlons and Metz, and could reach every\r\npoint in the line of march more rapidly than McMahon himself. Napoleon had\r\nquitted Metz on the evening of the 15th; on the 17th a council of war was\r\nheld at Châlons, at which it was determined to fall back upon Paris and to\r\nawait the attack of the Crown Prince under the forts of the capital. No\r\nsooner was this decision announced to the Government at Paris than the\r\nEmpress telegraphed to her husband warning him to consider what would be\r\nthe effects of his return, and insisting that an attempt should be made to\r\nrelieve Bazaine. [541] McMahon, against his own better judgment, consented\r\nto the northern march. He moved in the first instance to Rheims in order to\r\nconceal his intention from the enemy, but by doing this he lost some days.\r\nOn the 23rd, in pursuance of arrangements made with Bazaine, whose\r\nmessengers were still able to escape the Prussian watch, he set out\r\nnorth-eastwards in the direction of Montmédy.\r\n\r\n[German movement northwards, Aug 26.]\r\n\r\n[Battle of Sedan, Sept. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Capitulation of Sedan, Sept. 2.]\r\n\r\nThe movement was discovered by the Prussian cavalry and reported at the\r\nheadquarters at Bar-le-Duc on the 25th. Instantly the westward march of the\r\nCrown Prince was arrested, and his army, with that of the Prince of Saxony,\r\nwas thrown northwards in forced marches towards Sedan. On reaching Le\r\nChesne, west of the Meuse, on the 27th, McMahon became aware of the enemy's\r\npresence. He saw that his plan was discovered, and resolved to retreat\r\nwestwards before it was too late. The Emperor, who had attached himself to\r\nthe army, consented, but again the Government at Paris interfered with\r\nfatal effect. More anxious for the safety of the dynasty than for the\r\nexistence of the army, the Empress and her advisers insisted that McMahon\r\nshould continue his advance. Napoleon seems now to have abdicated all\r\nauthority and thrown to the winds all responsibility. He allowed the march\r\nto be resumed in the direction of Mouzon and Stenay. Failly's corps, which\r\nformed the right wing, was attacked on the 29th before it could reach the\r\npassage of the Meuse at the latter place, and was driven northwards to\r\nBeaumont. Here the commander strangely imagined himself to be in security.\r\nHe was surprised in his camp on the following day, defeated, and driven\r\nnorthwards towards Mouzon. Meanwhile the left of McMahon's army had crossed\r\nthe Meuse and moved eastwards to Carignan, so that his troops were severed\r\nby the river and at some distance from one another. Part of Failly's men\r\nwere made prisoners in the struggle on the south, or dispersed on the west\r\nof the Meuse; the remainder, with their commander, made a hurried and\r\ndisorderly escape beyond the river, and neglected to break down the bridges\r\nby which they had passed. McMahon saw that if the advance was continued his\r\ndivisions would one after another fall into the enemy's hands. He recalled\r\nthe troops which had reached Carignan, and concentrated his army about\r\nSedan to fight a pitched battle. The passages of the Meuse above and below\r\nSedan were seized by the Germans. Two hundred and forty thousand men were\r\nat Moltke's disposal; McMahon had about half that number. The task of the\r\nGermans was not so much to defeat the enemy as to prevent them from\r\nescaping to the Belgian frontier. On the morning of September 1st, while on\r\nthe east of Sedan the Bavarians after a desperate resistance stormed the\r\nvillage of Bazeilles, Hessian and Prussian regiments crossed the Meuse at\r\nDonchéry several miles to the west. From either end of this line corps\r\nafter corps now pushed northwards round the French positions, driving in\r\nthe enemy wherever they found them, and, converging under the eyes of the\r\nPrussian King, his general, and his Minister, each into its place in the\r\narc of fire before which the French Empire was to perish. The movement was\r\nas admirably executed as designed. The French fought furiously but in vain:\r\nthe mere mass of the enemy, the mere narrowing of the once completed\r\ncircle, crushed down resistance without the clumsy havoc of Gravelotte.\r\nFrom point after point the defenders were forced back within Sedan itself.\r\nThe streets were choked with hordes of beaten infantry and cavalry; the\r\nGermans had but to take one more step forward and the whole of their\r\nbatteries would command the town. Towards evening there was a pause in the\r\nfiring, in order that the French might offer negotiations for surrender;\r\nbut no sign of surrender was made, and the Bavarian cannon resumed their\r\nfire, throwing shells into the town itself. Napoleon now caused a white\r\nflag to be displayed on the fortress, and sent a letter to the King of\r\nPrussia, stating that as he had not been able to die in the midst of his\r\ntroops, nothing remained for him but to surrender his sword into the hands\r\nof his Majesty. The surrender was accepted by King William, who added that\r\nGeneral Moltke would act on his behalf in arranging terms of capitulation.\r\nGeneral Wimpffen, who had succeeded to the command of the French army on\r\nthe disablement of McMahon by a wound, acted on behalf of Napoleon. The\r\nnegotiations continued till late in the night, the French general pressing\r\nfor permission for his troops to be disarmed in Belgium, while Moltke\r\ninsisted on the surrender of the entire army as prisoners of war. Fearing\r\nthe effect of an appeal by Napoleon himself to the King's kindly nature,\r\nBismarck had taken steps to remove his sovereign to a distance until the\r\nterms of surrender should be signed. At daybreak on September 2nd Napoleon\r\nsought the Prussian headquarters. He was met on the road by Bismarck, who\r\nremained in conversation with him till the capitulation was completed on\r\nthe terms required by the Germans. He then conducted Napoleon to the\r\nneighbouring château of Bellevue, where King William, the Crown Prince, and\r\nthe Prince of Saxony visited him. One pang had still to be borne by the\r\nunhappy man. Down to his interview with the King, Napoleon had imagined\r\nthat all the German armies together had operated against him at Sedan, and\r\nhe must consequently have still had some hope that his own ruin might have\r\npurchased the deliverance of Bazaine. He learnt accidentally from the King\r\nthat Prince Frederick Charles had never stirred from before Metz. A\r\nconvulsion of anguish passed over his face: his eyes filled with tears.\r\nThere was no motive for a prolonged interview between the conqueror and the\r\nconquered, for, as a prisoner, Napoleon could not discuss conditions of\r\npeace. After some minutes of conversation the King departed for the\r\nPrussian headquarters. Napoleon remained in the château until the morning\r\nof the next day, and then began his journey towards the place chosen for\r\nhis captivity, the palace of Wilhelmshöhe at Cassel. [542]\r\n\r\n[The Republic Proclaimed, Sept. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Circular of Jules Favre, Sept. 6.]\r\n\r\nRumours of disaster had reached Paris in the last days of August, but to\r\neach successive report of evil the Government replied with lying boasts of\r\nsuccess, until on the 3rd of September it was forced to announce a\r\ncatastrophe far surpassing the worst anticipations of the previous days.\r\nWith the Emperor and his entire army in the enemy's hands, no one supposed\r\nthat the dynasty could any longer remain on the throne: the only question\r\nwas by what form of government the Empire should be succeeded. The\r\nLegislative Chamber assembled in the dead of night; Jules Favre proposed\r\nthe deposition of the Emperor, and was heard in silence. The Assembly\r\nadjourned for some hours. On the morning of the 4th, Thiers, who sought to\r\nkeep the way open for an Orleanist restoration, moved that a Committee of\r\nGovernment should be appointed by the Chamber itself, and that elections to\r\na new Assembly should be held as soon as circumstances should permit.\r\nBefore this and other propositions of the same nature could be put to the\r\nvote, the Chamber was invaded by the mob. Gambetta, with most of the\r\nDeputies for Paris, proceeded to the Hôtel de Ville, and there proclaimed\r\nthe Republic. The Empress fled; a Government of National Defence came into\r\nexistence, with General Trochu at its head, Jules Favre assuming the\r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs and Gambetta that of the Interior. No hand was\r\nraised in defence of the Napoleonic dynasty or of the institutions of the\r\nEmpire. The Legislative Chamber and the Senate disappeared without even\r\nmaking an attempt to prolong their own existence. Thiers, without approving\r\nof the Republic or the mode in which it had come into being, recommended\r\nhis friends to accept the new Government, and gave it his own support. On\r\nthe 6th of September a circular of Jules Favre, addressed to the\r\nrepresentatives of France at all the European Courts, justified the\r\noverthrow of the Napoleonic Empire, and claimed for the Government by which\r\nit was succeeded the goodwill of the neutral Powers. Napoleon III. was\r\ncharged with the responsibility for the war: with the fall of his dynasty,\r\nit was urged, the reasons for a continuance of the struggle had ceased to\r\nexist. France only asked for a lasting peace. Such peace, however, must\r\nleave the territory of France inviolate, for peace with dishonour would be\r\nbut the prelude to a new war of extermination. \"Not an inch of our soil\r\nwill we cede\"--so ran the formula--\"not a stone of our fortresses.\" [543]\r\n\r\n[Favre and Bismarck, Sept. 29.]\r\n\r\nThe German Chancellor had nothing ready in the way of rhetoric equal to his\r\nantagonist's phrases; but as soon as the battle of Sedan was won it was\r\nsettled at the Prussian headquarters that peace would not be made without\r\nthe annexation of Alsace and Lorraine. Prince Bismarck has stated that his\r\nown policy would have stopped at the acquisition of Strasburg: Moltke,\r\nhowever, and the chiefs of the army pronounced that Germany could not be\r\nsecure against invasion while Metz remained in the hands of France, and\r\nthis opinion was accepted by the King. For a moment it was imagined that\r\nthe victory of Sedan had given the conqueror peace on his own terms. This\r\nhope, however, speedily disappeared, and the march upon Paris was resumed\r\nby the army of the Crown Prince without waste of time. In the third week of\r\nSeptember the invaders approached the capital. Favre, in spite of his\r\ndeclaration of the 6th, was not indisposed to enter upon negotiations; and,\r\ntrusting to his own arts of persuasion, he sought an interview with the\r\nGerman Chancellor, which was granted to him at Ferrières on the 19th, and\r\ncontinued on the following day. Bismarck hesitated to treat the holders of\r\noffice in Paris as an established Government; he was willing to grant an\r\narmistice in order that elections might be held for a National Assembly\r\nwith which Germany could treat for peace; but he required, as a condition\r\nof the armistice, that Strasburg and Toul should be surrendered. Toul was\r\nalready at the last extremity; Strasburg was not capable of holding out ten\r\ndays longer; but of this the Government at Paris was not aware. The\r\nconditions demanded by Bismarck were rejected as insulting to France, and\r\nthe war was left to take its course. Already, while Favre was negotiating\r\nat Ferrières, the German vanguard was pressing round to the west of Paris.\r\nA body of French troops which attacked them on the 19th at Châtillon was\r\nput to the rout and fled in panic. Versailles was occupied on the same day,\r\nand the line of investment was shortly afterwards completed around the\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\n[Siege of Paris, Sept. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Tours.]\r\n\r\n[Gambetta at Tours.]\r\n\r\nThe second act in the war now began. Paris had been fortified by Thiers\r\nabout 1840, at the time when it seemed likely that France might be engaged\r\nin war with a coalition on the affairs of Mehemet Ali. The forts were not\r\ndistant enough from the city to protect it altogether from artillery with\r\nthe lengthened range of 1870; they were sufficient, however, to render an\r\nassault out of the question, and to compel the besieger to rely mainly on\r\nthe slow operation of famine. It had been reckoned by the engineers of 1840\r\nthat food enough might be collected to enable the city to stand a\r\ntwo-months' siege; so vast, however, were the supplies collected in 1870\r\nthat, with double the population, Paris had provisions for above four\r\nmonths. In spite therefore of the capture and destruction of its armies the\r\ncause of France was not hopeless, if, while Paris and Metz occupied four\r\nhundred thousand of the invaders, the population of the provinces should\r\ntake up the struggle with enthusiasm, and furnish after some months of\r\nmilitary exercise troops more numerous than those which France had lost, to\r\nattack the besiegers from all points at once and to fall upon their\r\ncommunications. To organise such a national resistance was, however,\r\nimpossible for any Government within the besieged capital itself. It was\r\ntherefore determined to establish a second seat of Government on the Loire;\r\nand before the lines were drawn round Paris three members of the Ministry,\r\nwith M. Crémieux at their head, set out for Tours. Crémieux, however, who\r\nwas an aged lawyer, proved quite unequal to his task. His authority was\r\ndisputed in the west and the south. Revolutionary movements threatened to\r\nbreak up the unity of the national defence. A stronger hand, a more\r\ncommanding will, was needed. Such a hand, such a will belonged to Gambetta,\r\nwho on the 7th of October left Paris in order to undertake the government\r\nof the provinces and the organisation of the national armies. The circle of\r\nthe besiegers was now too closely drawn for the ordinary means of travel to\r\nbe possible. Gambetta passed over the German lines in a balloon, and\r\nreached Tours in safety, where he immediately threw his feeble colleagues\r\ninto the background and concentrated all power in his own vigorous grasp.\r\nThe effect of his presence was at once felt throughout France. There was an\r\nend of the disorders in the great cities, and of all attempts at rivalry\r\nwith the central power. Gambetta had the faults of rashness, of excessive\r\nself-confidence, of defective regard for scientific authority in matters\r\nwhere he himself was ignorant: but he possessed in an extraordinary degree\r\nthe qualities necessary for a Dictator at such a national crisis:\r\nboundless, indomitable courage; a simple, elemental passion of love for his\r\ncountry that left absolutely no place for hesitations or reserve in the\r\nprosecution of the one object for which France then existed, the war. He\r\ncarried the nation with him like a whirlwind. Whatever share the military\r\nerrors of Gambetta and his rash personal interference with commanders may\r\nhave had in the ultimate defeat of France, without him it would never have\r\nbeen known of what efforts France was capable. The proof of his capacity\r\nwas seen in the hatred and the fear with which down to the time of his\r\ndeath he inspired the German people. Had there been at the head of the army\r\nof Metz a man of one-tenth of Gambetta's effective force, it is possible\r\nthat France might have closed the war, if not with success, at least with\r\nundiminished territory.\r\n\r\n[Fall of Strasburg, Sept. 28.]\r\n\r\n[The army of the Loire.]\r\n\r\n[Tann takes Orleans, Oct. 12.]\r\n\r\nBefore Gambetta left Paris the fall of Strasburg set free the army under\r\nGeneral Werder by which it had been besieged, and enabled the Germans to\r\nestablish a civil Government in Alsace, the western frontier of the new\r\nProvince having been already so accurately studied that, when peace was\r\nmade in 1871, the frontier-line was drawn not upon one of the earlier\r\nFrench maps but on the map now published by the German staff. It was\r\nGambetta's first task to divide France into districts, each with its own\r\nmilitary centre, its own army, and its own commander. Four such districts\r\nwere made: the centres were Lille, Le Mans, Bourges, and Besançon. At\r\nBourges and in the neighbourhood considerable progress had already been\r\nmade in organisation. Early in October German cavalry-detachments,\r\nexploring southwards, found that French troops were gathering on the Loire.\r\nThe Bavarian General Von der Tann was detached by Moltke from the besieging\r\narmy at Paris, and ordered to make himself master of Orleans. Von der Tann\r\nhastened southwards, defeated the French outside Orleans on the 11th of\r\nOctober, and occupied this city, the French retiring towards Bourges.\r\nGambetta removed the defeated commander, and set in his place General\r\nAurelle de Paladines. Von der Tann was directed to cross the Loire and\r\ndestroy the arsenals at Bourges; he reported, however, that this task was\r\nbeyond his power, in consequence of which Moltke ordered General Werder\r\nwith the army of Strasburg to move westwards against Bourges, after\r\ndispersing the weak forces that were gathering about Besançon. Werder set\r\nout on his dangerous march, but he had not proceeded far when an army of\r\nvery different power was thrown into the scale against the French levies on\r\nthe Loire.\r\n\r\n[Bazaine at Metz.]\r\n\r\n[Capitulation of Metz, Oct. 27.]\r\n\r\nIn the battle of Gravelotte, fought on the 18th of August, the French\r\ntroops had been so handled by Bazaine as to render it doubtful whether he\r\nreally intended to break through the enemy's line and escape from Metz. At\r\nwhat period political designs inconsistent with his military duty first\r\ntook possession of Bazaine's thoughts is uncertain. He had played a\r\npolitical part in Mexico; it is probable that as soon as he found himself\r\nat the head of the one effective army of France, and saw Napoleon\r\nhopelessly discredited, he began to aim at personal power. Before the\r\ndownfall of the Empire he had evidently adopted a scheme of inaction with\r\nthe object of preserving his army entire: even the sortie by which it had\r\nbeen arranged that he should assist McMahon on the day before Sedan was\r\nfeebly and irresolutely conducted. After the proclamation of the Republic\r\nBazaine's inaction became still more marked. The intrigues of an adventurer\r\nnamed Regnier, who endeavoured to open a negotiation between the Prussians\r\nand the exiled Empress Eugénie, encouraged him in his determination to keep\r\nhis soldiers from fulfilling their duty to France. Week after week passed\r\nby; a fifth of the besieging army was struck down with sickness; yet\r\nBazaine made no effort to break through, or even to diminish the number of\r\nmen who were consuming the supplies of Metz by giving to separate\r\ndetachments the opportunity of escape. On the 12th of October, after the\r\npretence of a sortie on the north, he entered into communication with the\r\nGerman headquarters at Versailles. Bismarck offered to grant a free\r\ndeparture to the army of Metz on condition that the fortress should be\r\nplaced in his hands, that the army should undertake to act on behalf of the\r\nEmpress, and that the Empress should pledge herself to accept the Prussian\r\nconditions of peace, whatever these might be. General Boyer was sent to\r\nEngland to acquaint the Empress with these propositions. They were declined\r\nby her, and after a fortnight had been spent in manoeuvres for a\r\nBonapartist restoration. Bazaine found himself at the end of his resources.\r\nOn the 27th the capitulation of Metz was signed. The fortress itself, with\r\nincalculable cannon and material of war, and an army of a hundred and\r\nseventy thousand men, including twenty-six thousand sick and wounded in the\r\nhospitals, passed into the hands of the Germans. [544]\r\n\r\n[Bazaine.]\r\n\r\nBazaine was at a later time tried by a court-martial, found guilty of the\r\nneglect of duty, and sentenced to death. That sentence was not executed;\r\nbut if there is an infamy that is worse than death, such infamy will to all\r\ntime cling to his name. In the circumstances in which France was placed no\r\neffort, no sacrifice of life could have been too great for the commander of\r\nthe army at Metz. To retain the besiegers in full strength before the\r\nfortress would not have required the half of Bazaine's actual force. If\r\nhalf his army had fallen on the field of battle in successive attempts to\r\ncut their way through the enemy, brave men would no doubt have perished;\r\nbut even had their efforts failed their deaths would have purchased for\r\nMetz the power to hold out for weeks or for months longer. The civil\r\npopulation of Metz was but sixty thousand, its army was three times as\r\nnumerous; unlike Paris, it saw its stores consumed not by helpless millions\r\nof women and children, but by soldiers whose duty it was to aid the defence\r\nof their country at whatever cost. Their duty, if they could not cut their\r\nway through, was to die fighting; and had they shown hesitation, which was\r\nnot the case, Bazaine should have died at their head. That Bazaine would\r\nhave fulfilled his duty even if Napoleon III. had remained on the throne is\r\nmore than doubtful, for his inaction had begun before the catastrophe of\r\nSedan. His pretext after that time was that the government of France had\r\nfallen into the hands of men of disorder, and that it was more important\r\nfor his army to save France from the Government than from the invader. He\r\nwas the only man in France who thought so. The Government of September 4th,\r\nwhatever its faults, was good enough for tens of thousands of brave men,\r\nLegitimists, Orleanists, Bonapartists, who flocked without distinction of\r\nparty to its banners: it might have been good enough for Marshal Bazaine.\r\nBut France had to pay the penalty for the political, the moral indifference\r\nwhich could acquiesce in the Coup d'État of 1851, in the servility of the\r\nEmpire, in many a vile and boasted deed in Mexico, in China, in Algiers.\r\nSuch indifference found its Nemesis in a Bazaine.\r\n\r\n[Tann driven from Orleans, Nov. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Battles of Orleans, Nov. 28-Dec. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Sortie of Champigny, Nov. 29-Dec. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Battle of Amiens, Nov. 27.]\r\n\r\nThe surrender of Metz and the release of the great army of Prince Frederick\r\nCharles by which it was besieged fatally changed the conditions of the\r\nFrench war of national defence. Two hundred thousand of the victorious\r\ntroops of Germany under some of their ablest generals were set free to\r\nattack the still untrained levies on the Loire and in the north of France,\r\nwhich, with more time for organisation, might well have forced the Germans\r\nto raise the siege of Paris. The army once commanded by Steinmetz was now\r\nreconstituted, and despatched under General Manteuffel towards Amiens;\r\nPrince Frederick Charles moved with the remainder of his troops towards the\r\nLoire. Aware that his approach could not long be delayed, Gambetta insisted\r\nthat Aurelle de Paladines should begin the march on Paris. The general\r\nattacked Tann at Coulmiers on the 9th of November, defeated him, and\r\nre-occupied Orleans, the first real success that the French had gained in\r\nthe war. There was great alarm at the German headquarters at Versailles;\r\nthe possibility of a failure of the siege was discussed; and forty thousand\r\ntroops were sent southwards in haste to the support of the Bavarian\r\ngeneral. Aurelle, however, did not move upon the capital: his troops were\r\nstill unfit for the enterprise; and he remained stationary on the north of\r\nOrleans, in order to improve his organisation, to await reinforcements, and\r\nto meet the attack of Frederick Charles in a strong position. In the third\r\nweek of November the leading divisions of the army of Metz approached, and\r\ntook post between Orleans and Paris. Gambetta now insisted that the effort\r\nshould be made to relieve the capital. Aurelle resisted, but was forced to\r\nobey. The garrison of Paris had already made several unsuccessful attacks\r\nupon the lines of their besiegers, the most vigorous being that of Le\r\nBourget on the 30th of October, in which bayonets were crossed. It was\r\narranged that in the last days of November General Trochu should endeavour\r\nto break out on the southern side, and that simultaneously the army of the\r\nLoire should fall upon the enemy in front of it and endeavour to force its\r\nway to the capital. On the 28th the attack upon the Germans on the north of\r\nOrleans began. For several days the struggle was renewed by one division\r\nafter another of the armies of Aurelle and Prince Frederick Charles.\r\nVictory remained at last with the Germans; the centre of the French\r\nposition was carried; the right and left wings of the army were severed\r\nfrom one another and forced to retreat, the one up the Loire, the other\r\ntowards the west. Orleans on the 5th of December passed back into the hands\r\nof the Germans. The sortie from Paris, which began with a successful attack\r\nby General Ducrot upon Champigny beyond the Marne, ended after some days of\r\ncombat in the recovery by the Germans of the positions which they had lost,\r\nand in the retreat of Ducrot into Paris. In the same week Manteuffel,\r\nmoving against the relieving army of the north, encountered it near Amiens,\r\ndefeated it after a hard struggle, and gained possession of Amiens itself.\r\n\r\n[Rouen occupied, Dec. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Bapaume, Jan. 3.]\r\n\r\n[St. Quentin, Jan 19.]\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Amiens, Manteuffel moved upon Rouen. This city fell into\r\nhis hands without resistance; the conquerors pressed on westwards, and at\r\nDieppe troops which had come from the confines of Russia gazed for the\r\nfirst time upon the sea. But the Republican armies, unlike those which the\r\nGermans had first encountered, were not to be crushed at a single blow.\r\nUnder the energetic command of Faidherbe the army of the North advanced\r\nagain upon Amiens. Goeben, who was left to defend the line of the Somme,\r\nwent out to meet him, defeated him on the 23rd of December, and drove him\r\nback to Arras. But again, after a week's interval, Faidherbe pushed\r\nforward. On the 3rd of January he fell upon Goeben's weak division at\r\nBapaume, and handled it so severely that the Germans would on the following\r\nday have abandoned their position, if the French had not themselves been\r\nthe first to retire. Faidherbe, however, had only fallen back to receive\r\nreinforcements. After some days' rest he once more sought to gain the road\r\nto Paris, advancing this time by the eastward line through St. Quentin. In\r\nfront of this town Goeben attacked him. The last battle of the army of the\r\nNorth was fought on the 19th of January. The French general endeavoured to\r\ndisguise his defeat, but the German commander had won all that he desired.\r\nFaidherbe's army was compelled to retreat northwards in disorder; its part\r\nin the war was at an end.\r\n\r\n[The Armies of the Loire and of the East.]\r\n\r\n[Le Mans, Jan. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Bourbaki.]\r\n\r\n[Montbéliard, Jan. 15-17.]\r\n\r\n[The Eastern army crosses the Swiss Frontier, Feb. 1.]\r\n\r\nDuring the last three weeks of December there was a pause in the operations\r\nof the Germans on the Loire. It was expected that Bourbaki and the east\r\nwing of The Armies of the French army would soon re-appear at Orleans and\r\nendeavour to combine with Chanzy's troops. Gambetta, however, had formed\r\nanother plan. He considered that Chanzy, with the assistance of divisions\r\nformed in Brittany, would be strong enough to encounter Prince Frederick\r\nCharles, and he determined to throw the army of Bourbaki, strengthened by\r\nreinforcements from the south, upon Germany itself. The design was a daring\r\none, and had the two French armies been capable of performing the work\r\nwhich Gambetta required of them, an inroad into Baden, or even the\r\nre-conquest of Alsace, would most seriously have affected the position of\r\nthe Germans before Paris. But Gambetta miscalculated the power of young,\r\nuntrained troops, imperfectly armed, badly fed, against a veteran enemy. In\r\na series of hard-fought struggles the army of the Loire under General\r\nChanzy was driven back at the beginning of January from Vendôme to Le Mans.\r\nOn the 12th, Chanzy took post before this city and fought his last battle.\r\nWhile he was making a vigorous resistance in the centre of the line, the\r\nBreton regiments stationed on his right gave way; the Germans pressed round\r\nhim, and gained possession of the town. Chanzy retreated towards Laval,\r\nleaving thousands of prisoners in the hands of the enemy, and saving only\r\nthe debris of an army. Bourbaki in the meantime, with a numerous but\r\nmiserably equipped force, had almost reached Belfort. The report of his\r\neastward movement was not at first believed at the German headquarters\r\nbefore Paris, and the troops of General Werder, which had been engaged\r\nabout Dijon with a body of auxiliaries commanded by Garibaldi, were left to\r\nbear the brunt of the attack without support. When the real state of\r\naffairs became known Manteuffel was sent eastwards in hot haste towards the\r\nthreatened point. Werder had evacuated Dijon and fallen back upon Vesoul;\r\npart of his army was still occupied in the siege of Belfort. As Bourbaki\r\napproached he fell back with the greater part of his troops in order to\r\ncover the besieging force, leaving one of his lieutenants to make a flank\r\nattack upon Bourbaki at Villersexel. This attack, one of the fiercest in\r\nthe war, delayed the French for two days, and gave Werder time to occupy\r\nthe strong positions that he had chosen about Montbéliard. Here, on the\r\n15th of January, began a struggle which lasted for three days. The French,\r\nstarving and perishing with cold, though far superior in number to their\r\nenemy, were led with little effect against the German entrenchments. On the\r\n18th Bourbaki began his retreat. Werder was unable to follow him;\r\nManteuffel with a weak force was still at some distance, and for a moment\r\nit seemed possible that Bourbaki, by a rapid movement westwards, might\r\ncrush this isolated foe. Gambetta ordered Bourbaki to make the attempt: the\r\ncommander refused to court further disaster with troops who were not fit to\r\nface an enemy, and retreated towards Pontarlier in the hope of making his\r\nway to Lyons. But Manteuffel now descended in front of him; divisions of\r\nWerder's army pressed down from the north; the retreat was cut off; and the\r\nunfortunate French general, whom a telegram from Gambetta removed from his\r\ncommand, attempted to take his own life. On the 1st of February, the wreck\r\nof his army, still numbering eighty-five thousand men, but reduced to the\r\nextremity of weakness and misery, sought refuge beyond the Swiss frontier.\r\n\r\n[Capitulation of Paris and Armistice, Jan. 28.]\r\n\r\nThe war was now over. Two days after Bourbaki's repulse at Montbéliard the\r\nlast unsuccessful sortie was made from Paris. There now remained provisions\r\nonly for another fortnight; above forty thousand of the inhabitants had\r\nsuccumbed to the privations of the siege; all hope of assistance from the\r\nrelieving armies before actual famine should begin disappeared. On the 23rd\r\nof January Favre sought the German Chancellor at Versailles in order to\r\ndiscuss the conditions of a general armistice and of the capitulation of\r\nParis. The negotiations lasted for several days; on the 28th an armistice\r\nwas signed with the declared object that elections might at once be freely\r\nheld for a National Assembly, which should decide whether the war should be\r\ncontinued, or on what conditions peace should be made. The conditions of\r\nthe armistice were that the forts of Paris and all their material of war\r\nshould be handed over to the German army; that the artillery of the\r\nenceinte should be dismounted; and that the regular troops in Paris should,\r\nas prisoners of war, surrender their arms. The National Guard were\r\npermitted to retain their weapons and their artillery. Immediately upon the\r\nfulfilment of the first two conditions all facilities were to be given for\r\nthe entry of supplies of food into Paris. [545]\r\n\r\n[National Assembly at Bordeaux, Feb. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Preliminaries of Peace, Feb. 26.]\r\n\r\nThe articles of the armistice were duly executed, and on the 30th of\r\nJanuary the Prussian flag waved over the forts of the French capital.\r\nOrders were sent into the provinces by the Government that elections should\r\nat once be held. It had at one time been feared by Count Bismarck that\r\nGambetta would acknowledge no armistice that might be made by his\r\ncolleagues at Paris. But this apprehension was not realised, for, while\r\nprotesting against a measure adopted without consultation with himself and\r\nhis companions at Bordeaux, Gambetta did not actually reject the armistice.\r\nHe called upon the nation, however, to use the interval for the collection\r\nof new forces; and in the hope of gaining from the election an Assembly in\r\nfavour of a continuation of the war, he published a decree incapacitating\r\nfor election all persons who had been connected with the Government of\r\nNapoleon III. Against this decree Bismarck at once protested, and at his\r\ninstance it was cancelled by the Government of Paris. Gambetta thereupon\r\nresigned. The elections were held on the 8th of February, and on the 12th\r\nthe National Assembly was opened at Bordeaux. The Government of Defence now\r\nlaid down its powers. Thiers--who had been the author of those\r\nfortifications which had kept the Germans at bay for four months after the\r\noverthrow of the Imperial armies; who, in the midst of the delirium of\r\nJuly, 1870, had done all that man could do to dissuade the Imperial\r\nGovernment and its Parliament from war; who, in spite of his seventy years,\r\nhad, after the fall of Napoleon, hurried to London, to St. Petersburg, to\r\nFlorence, to Vienna, in the hope of winning some support for France,--was\r\nthe man called by common assent to the helm of State. He appointed a\r\nMinistry, called upon the Assembly to postpone all discussions as to the\r\nfuture Government of France, and himself proceeded to Versailles in order\r\nto negotiate conditions of peace. For several days the old man struggled\r\nwith Count Bismarck on point after point in the Prussian demands. Bismarck\r\nrequired the cession of Alsace and Eastern Lorraine, the payment of six\r\nmilliards of francs, and the occupation of part of Paris by the German army\r\nuntil the conditions of peace should be ratified by the Assembly. Thiers\r\nstrove hard to save Metz, but on this point the German staff was\r\ninexorable; he succeeded at last in reducing the indemnity to five\r\nmilliards, and was given the option between retaining Belfort and sparing\r\nParis the entry of the German troops. On the last point his patriotism\r\ndecided without a moment's hesitation. He bade the Germans enter Paris, and\r\nsaved Belfort for France. On the 26th of February preliminaries of peace\r\nwere signed. Thirty thousand German soldiers marched into the Champs\r\nElysées on the 1st of March; but on that same day the treaty was ratified\r\nby the Assembly at Bordeaux, and after forty-eight hours Paris was freed\r\nfrom the sight of its conquerors. The Articles of Peace provided for the\r\ngradual evacuation of France by the German army as the instalments of the\r\nindemnity, which were allowed to extend over a period of three years,\r\nshould be paid. There remained for settlement only certain matters of\r\ndetail, chiefly connected with finance; these, however, proved the object\r\nof long and bitter controversy, and it was not until the 10th of May that\r\nthe definitive Treaty of Peace was signed at Frankfort.\r\n\r\n[German Unity.]\r\n\r\nFrance had made war in order to undo the work of partial union effected by\r\nPrussia in 1866: it achieved the opposite result, and Germany emerged from\r\nthe war with the Empire established. Immediately after the victory of Wörth\r\nthe Crown Prince had seen that the time had come for abolishing the line of\r\ndivision which severed Southern Germany from the Federation of the North.\r\nHis own conception of the best form of national union was a German Empire\r\nwith its chief at Berlin. That Count Bismarck was without plans for uniting\r\nNorth and South Germany it is impossible to believe; but the Minister and\r\nthe Crown Prince had always been at enmity; and when, after the battle of\r\nSedan, they spoke together of the future, it seemed to the Prince as if\r\nBismarck had scarcely thought of the federation of the Empire or of the\r\nre-establishment of the Imperial dignity, and as if he was inclined to it\r\nonly under certain reserves. It was, however, part of Bismarck's system to\r\nexclude the Crown Prince as far as possible from political affairs, under\r\nthe strange pretext that his relationship to Queen Victoria would be abused\r\nby the French proclivities of the English Court; and it is possible that\r\nhad the Chancellor after the battle of Sedan chosen to admit the Prince to\r\nhis confidence instead of resenting his interference, the difference\r\nbetween their views as to the future of Germany would have been seen to be\r\none rather of forms and means than of intention. But whatever the share of\r\nthese two dissimilar spirits in the initiation of the last steps towards\r\nGerman union, the work, as ultimately achieved, was both in form and in\r\nsubstance that which the Crown Prince had conceived. In the course of\r\nSeptember negotiations were opened with each of the Southern States for its\r\nentry into the Northern Confederation. Bavaria alone raised serious\r\ndifficulties, and demanded terms to which the Prussian Government could not\r\nconsent. Bismarck refrained from exercising pressure at Munich, but invited\r\nthe several Governments to send representatives to Versailles for the\r\npurpose of arriving at a settlement. For a moment the Court of Munich drew\r\nthe sovereign of Würtemberg to its side, and orders were sent to the envoys\r\nof Würtemberg at Versailles to act with the Bavarians in refusing to sign\r\nthe treaty projected by Bismarck. The Würtemberg Ministers hereupon\r\ntendered their resignation; Baden and Hesse-Darmstadt signed the treaty,\r\nand the two dissentient kings saw themselves on the point of being excluded\r\nfrom United Germany. They withdrew their opposition, and at the end of\r\nNovember the treaties uniting all the Southern States with the existing\r\nConfederation were executed, Bavaria retaining larger separate rights than\r\nwere accorded to any other member of the Union.\r\n\r\n[Proclamation of the Empire, Jan. 18.]\r\n\r\nIn the acts which thus gave to Germany political cohesion there was nothing\r\nthat altered the title of its chief. Bismarck, however, had in the meantime\r\ninformed the recalcitrant sovereigns that if they did not themselves offer\r\nthe Imperial dignity to King William, the North German Parliament would do\r\nso. At the end of November a letter was accordingly sent by the King of\r\nBavaria to all his fellow-sovereigns, proposing that the King of Prussia,\r\nas President of the newly-formed Federation, should assume the title of\r\nGerman Emperor. Shortly afterwards the same request was made by the same\r\nsovereign to King William himself, in a letter dictated by Bismarck. A\r\ndeputation from the North German Reichstag, headed by its President, Dr.\r\nSimson, who, as President of the Frankfort National Assembly, had in 1849\r\noffered the Imperial Crown to King Frederick William, expressed the\r\nconcurrence of the nation in the act of the Princes. It was expected that\r\nbefore the end of the year the new political arrangements would have been\r\nsanctioned by the Parliaments of all the States concerned, and the 1st of\r\nJanuary had been fixed for the assumption of the Imperial title. So\r\nvigorous, however, was the opposition made in the Bavarian Chamber, that\r\nthe ceremony was postponed till the 18th. Even then the final approving\r\nvote had not been taken at Munich; but a second adjournment would have been\r\nfatal to the dignity of the occasion; and on the 18th of January, in the\r\nmidst of the Princes of Germany and the representatives of its army\r\nassembled in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, King William assumed the\r\ntitle of German Emperor. The first Parliament of the Empire was opened at\r\nBerlin two months later.\r\n\r\n[The Commune of Paris.]\r\n\r\n[Troops withdrawn to Versailles, March 18.]\r\n\r\n[The Commune.]\r\n\r\nThe misfortunes of France did not end with the fall of its capital and the\r\nloss of its border provinces; the terrible drama of 1870 closed with civil\r\nwar. It is part of the normal order of French history that when an\r\nestablished Government is overthrown, and another is set in its place, this\r\nsecond Government is in its turn attacked by insurrection in Paris, and an\r\neffort is made to establish the rule of the democracy of the capital\r\nitself, or of those who for the moment pass for its leaders. It was so in\r\n1793, in 1831, in 1848, and it was so again in 1870. Favre, Trochu, and the\r\nother members of the Government of Defence had assumed power on the\r\ndownfall of Napoleon III. because they considered themselves the\r\nindividuals best able to serve the State. There were hundreds of other\r\npersons in Paris who had exactly the same opinion of themselves; and when,\r\nwith the progress of the siege, the Government of Defence lost its\r\npopularity and credit, it was natural that ambitious and impatient men of a\r\nlower political rank should consider it time to try whether Paris could not\r\nmake a better defence under their own auspices. Attempts were made before\r\nthe end of October to overthrow the Government. They were repeated at\r\nintervals, but without success. The agitation, however, continued within\r\nthe ranks of the National Guard, which, unlike the National Guard in the\r\ntime of Louis Philippe, now included the mass of the working class, and was\r\nthe most dangerous enemy, instead of the support, of Government. The\r\ncapitulation brought things to a crisis. Favre had declared that it would\r\nbe impossible to disarm the National Guard without a battle in the streets;\r\nat his instance Bismarck allowed the National Guard to retain their\r\nweapons, and the fears of the Government itself thus prepared the way for\r\nsuccessful insurrection. When the Germans were about to occupy western\r\nParis, the National Guard drew off its artillery to Montmartre and there\r\nerected entrenchments. During the next fortnight, while the Germans were\r\nwithdrawing from the western forts in accordance with the conditions of\r\npeace, the Government and the National Guard stood facing one another in\r\ninaction; on the 18th of March General Lecomte was ordered to seize the\r\nartillery parked at Montmartre. His troops, surrounded and solicited by the\r\nNational Guard, abandoned their commander. Lecomte was seized, and, with\r\nGeneral Clément Thomas, was put to death. A revolutionary Central Committee\r\ntook possession of the Hôtel de Ville; the troops still remaining faithful\r\nto the Government were withdrawn to Versailles, where Thiers had assembled\r\nthe Chamber. Not only Paris itself, but the western forts with the\r\nexception of Mont Valérien, fell into the hands of the insurgents. On the\r\n26th of March elections were held for the Commune. The majority of peaceful\r\ncitizens abstained from voting. A council was elected, which by the side of\r\ncertain harmless and well-meaning men contained a troop of revolutionists\r\nby profession; and after the failure of all attempts at conciliation,\r\nhostilities began between Paris and Versailles.\r\n\r\n[Second Siege--April 2, May 21.]\r\n\r\nThere were in the ranks of those who fought for the Commune some who fought\r\nin the sincere belief that their cause was that of municipal freedom; there\r\nwere others who believed, and with good reason, that the existence of the\r\nRepublic was threatened by a reactionary Assembly at Versailles; but the\r\nmovement was on the whole the work of fanatics who sought to subvert every\r\nauthority but their own; and the unfortunate mob who followed them, in so\r\nfar as they fought for anything beyond the daily pay which had been their\r\nonly means of sustenance since the siege began, fought for they knew not\r\nwhat. As the conflict was prolonged, it took on both sides a character of\r\natrocious violence and cruelty. The murder of Generals Lecomte and Thomas\r\nat the outset was avenged by the execution of some of the first prisoners\r\ntaken by the troops of Versailles. Then hostages were seized by the\r\nCommune. The slaughter in cold blood of three hundred National Guards\r\nsurprised at Clamart by the besiegers gave to the Parisians the example of\r\nmassacre. When, after a siege of six weeks, in which Paris suffered far\r\nmore severely than it had suffered from the cannonade of the Germans, the\r\ntroops of Versailles at length made their way into the capital, humanity,\r\ncivilisation, seemed to have vanished in the orgies of devils. The\r\ndefenders, as they fell back, murdered their hostages, and left behind them\r\npalaces, museums, the entire public inheritance of the nation in its\r\ncapital, in flames. The conquerors during several days shot down all whom\r\nthey took fighting, and in many cases put to death whole bands of prisoners\r\nwithout distinction. The temper of the army was such that the Government,\r\neven if it had desired, could probably not have mitigated the terrors of\r\nthis vengeance. But there was little sign anywhere of an inclination to\r\nmercy. Courts-martial and executions continued long after the heat of\r\ncombat was over. A year passed, and the tribunals were still busy with\r\ntheir work. Above ten thousand persons were sentenced to transportation or\r\nimprisonment before public justice was satisfied.\r\n\r\n[Entry of Italian Troops into Rome, Sept. 20, 1870.]\r\n\r\n[The Papacy.]\r\n\r\nThe material losses which France sustained at the hands of the invader and\r\nin civil war were soon repaired; but from the battle of Wörth down to the\r\noverthrow of the Commune France had been effaced as a European Power, and\r\nits effacement was turned to good account by two nations who were not its\r\nenemies. Russia, with the sanction of Europe, threw off the trammels which\r\nhad been imposed upon it in the Black Sea by the Treaty of 1856. Italy\r\ngained possession of Rome. Soon after the declaration of war the troops of\r\nFrance, after an occupation of twenty-one years broken only by an interval\r\nof some months in 1867, were withdrawn from the Papal territory. Whatever\r\nmay have been the understanding with Victor Emmanuel on which Napoleon\r\nrecalled his troops from Civita Vecchia, the battle of Sedan set Italy\r\nfree; and on the 20th of September the National Army, after overcoming a\r\nbrief show of resistance, entered Rome. The unity of Italy was at last\r\ncompleted; Florence ceased to be the national capital. A body of laws\r\npassed by the Italian Parliament, and known as the Guarantees, assured to\r\nthe Pope the honours and immunities of a sovereign, the possession of the\r\nVatican and the Lateran palaces, and a princely income; in the appointment\r\nof Bishops and generally in the government of the Church a fulness of\r\nauthority was freely left to him such as he possessed in no other European\r\nland. But Pius would accept no compromise for the loss of his temporal\r\npower. He spurned the reconciliation with the Italian people, which had now\r\nfor the first time since 1849 become possible. He declared Rome to be in\r\nthe possession of brigands; and, with a fine affectation of disdain for\r\nVictor Emmanuel and the Italian Government, he invented, and sustained down\r\nto the end of his life, before a world too busy to pay much heed to his\r\nperformance, the reproachful part of the Prisoner of the Vatican.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrance after 1871--Alliance of the Three Emperors--Revolt of\r\nHerzegovina--The Andrássy Note--Murder of the Consuls at Salonika--The\r\nBerlin Memorandum--Rejected by England--Abdul Aziz deposed--Massacres in\r\nBulgaria--Servia and Montenegro declare War--Opinion in England--\r\nDisraeli--Meeting of Emperors at Reichstadt--Servian Campaign--Declaration\r\nof the Czar--Conference at Constantinople--Its Failure--The London\r\nProtocol--Russia declares War--Advance on the Balkans--Osman at\r\nPlevna--Second Attack on Plevna--The Shipka Pass--Roumania--Third attack\r\non Plevna--Todleben--Fall of Plevna--Passage of the Balkans--Armistice--\r\nEngland--The Fleet passes the Dardanelles--Treaty of San Stefano--England\r\nand Russia--Secret Agreement--Convention with Turkey--Congress of\r\nBerlin--Treaty of Berlin--Bulgaria.\r\n\r\n\r\n[France after 1871.]\r\n\r\nThe storm of 1870 was followed by some years of European calm. France,\r\nrecovering with wonderful rapidity from the wounds inflicted by the war,\r\npaid with ease the instalments of its debt to Germany, and saw its soil\r\nliberated from the foreigner before the period fixed by the Treaty of\r\nFrankfort. The efforts of a reactionary Assembly were kept in check by M.\r\nThiers; the Republic, as the form of government which divided Frenchmen the\r\nleast, was preferred by him to the monarchical restoration which might have\r\nwon France allies at some of the European Courts. For two years Thiers\r\nbaffled or controlled the royalist majority at Versailles which sought to\r\nplace the Comté de Chambord or the chief of the House of Orleans on the\r\nthrone, and thus saved his country from the greatest of all perils, the\r\nrenewal of civil war. In 1873 he fell before a combination of his\r\nopponents, and McMahon succeeded to the Presidency, only to find that the\r\nroyalist cause was made hopeless by the refusal of the Comté de Chambord to\r\nadopt the Tricolour flag, and that France, after several years of trial,\r\ndefinitely preferred the Republic. Meanwhile, Prince Bismarck had known how\r\nto frustrate all plans for raising a coalition against victorious Germany\r\namong the Powers which had been injured by its successes, or whose\r\ninterests were threatened by its greatness. He saw that a Bourbon or a\r\nNapoleon on the throne of France would find far more sympathy and\r\nconfidence at Vienna and St. Petersburg than the shifting chief of a\r\nRepublic, and ordered Count Arnim, the German Ambassador at Paris, who\r\nwished to promote a Napoleonic restoration, to desist from all attempts to\r\nweaken the Republican Government. At St. Petersburg, where after the\r\nmisfortunes of 1815 France had found its best friends, the German statesman\r\nhad as yet little to fear. Bismarck had supported Russia in undoing the\r\nTreaty of Paris; in announcing the conclusion of peace with France, the\r\nGerman Emperor had assured the Czar in the most solemn language that his\r\nservices in preventing the war of 1870 from becoming general should never\r\nbe forgotten; and, whatever might be the feeling of his subjects, Alexander\r\nII. continued to believe that Russia could find no steadier friend than the\r\nGovernment of Berlin.\r\n\r\n[Alliance of the three Emperors.]\r\n\r\nWith Austria Prince Bismarck had a more difficult part to play. He could\r\nhope for no real understanding so long as Beust remained at the head of\r\naffairs. But the events of 1870, utterly frustrating Beust's plans for a\r\ncoalition against Prussia, and definitely closing for Austria all hope of\r\nrecovering its position within Germany, had shaken the Minister's position.\r\nBismarck was able to offer to the Emperor Francis Joseph the sincere and\r\ncordial friendship of the powerful German Empire, on the condition that\r\nAustria should frankly accept the work of 1866 and 1870. He had dissuaded\r\nhis master after the victory of Königgrätz from annexing any Austrian\r\nterritory; he had imposed no condition of peace that left behind it a\r\nlasting exasperation; and he now reaped the reward of his foresight.\r\nFrancis Joseph accepted the friendship offered him from Berlin, and\r\ndismissed Count Beust from office, calling to his place the Hungarian\r\nMinister Andrássy, who, by conviction as well as profession, welcomed the\r\nestablishment of a German Empire, and the definite abandonment by Austria\r\nof its interference in German affairs. In the summer of 1872 the three\r\nEmperors, accompanied by their Ministers, met in Berlin. No formal alliance\r\nwas made, but a relation was established of sufficient intimacy to insure\r\nPrince Bismarck against any efforts that might be made by France to gain an\r\nally. For five years this so-called League of the three Emperors continued\r\nin more or less effective existence, and condemned France to isolation. In\r\nthe apprehension of the French people, Germany, gorged with the five\r\nmilliards but still lean and ravenous, sought only for some new occasion\r\nfor war. This was not the case. The German nation had entered unwillingly\r\ninto the war of 1870; that its ruler, when once his great aim had been\r\nachieved, sought peace not only in word but in deed the history of\r\nsubsequent years has proved. The alarms which at intervals were raised at\r\nParis and elsewhere had little real foundation; and when next the peace of\r\nEurope was broken, it was not by a renewal of the struggle on the Vosges,\r\nbut by a conflict in the East, which, terrible as it was in the sufferings\r\nand the destruction of life which it involved, was yet no senseless duel\r\nbetween two jealous nations, but one of the most fruitful in results of all\r\nmodern wars, rescuing whole provinces from Ottoman dominion, and leaving\r\nbehind it in place of a chaos of outworn barbarism at least the elements\r\nfor a future of national independence among the Balkan population.\r\n\r\n[Revolt of Herzegovina, Aug., 1875.]\r\n\r\n[Andrássy Note, Jan. 31, 1876.]\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1875 Herzegovina rose against its Turkish masters, and in\r\nBosnia conflicts broke out between Christians and Mohammedans. The\r\ninsurrection was vigorously, though privately, supported by Servia and\r\nMontenegro, and for some months baffled all the efforts made by the Porte\r\nfor its suppression. Many thousands of the Christians, flying from a\r\ndevastated land and a merciless enemy, sought refuge beyond the Austrian\r\nfrontier, and became a burden upon the Austrian Government. The agitation\r\namong the Slavic neighbours and kinsmen of the insurgents threatened the\r\npeace of Austria itself, where Slav and Magyar were almost as ready to fall\r\nupon one another as Christian and Turk. Andrássy entered into\r\ncommunications with the Governments of St. Petersburg and Berlin as to the\r\nadoption of a common line of policy by the three Empires towards the Porte;\r\nand a scheme of reforms, intended to effect the pacification of the\r\ninsurgent provinces, was drawn up by the three Ministers in concert with\r\none another. This project, which was known as the Andrássy Note, and which\r\nreceived the approval of England and France, demanded from the Porte the\r\nestablishment of full and entire religious liberty, the abolition of the\r\nfarming of taxes, the application of the revenue produced by direct\r\ntaxation in Bosnia and Herzegovina to the needs of those provinces\r\nthemselves, the institution of a Commission composed equally of Christians\r\nand Mohammedans to control the execution of these reforms and of those\r\npromised by the Porte, and finally the improvement of the agrarian\r\ncondition of the population by the sale to them of waste lands belonging to\r\nthe State. The Note demanding these reforms was presented in Constantinople\r\non the 31st of January, 1876. The Porte, which had already been lavish of\r\npromises to the insurgents, raised certain objections in detail, but\r\nultimately declared itself willing to grant in substance the concessions\r\nwhich were specified by the Powers. [546]\r\n\r\n[Murder of the Consuls at Salonika, May 6.]\r\n\r\nArmed with this assurance, the representatives of Austria now endeavoured\r\nto persuade the insurgents to lay down their arms and the refugees to\r\nreturn to their homes. But the answer was made that promises enough had\r\nalready been given by the Sultan, and that the question was, not what more\r\nwas to be written on a piece of paper, but how the execution of these\r\npromises was to be enforced. Without some guarantee from the Great Powers\r\nof Europe the refugees refused to place themselves again at the mercy of\r\nthe Turk, and the leaders in Herzegovina refused to disband their troops.\r\nThe conflict broke out afresh with greater energy; the intervention of the\r\nPowers, far from having produced peace, roused the fanatical passions of\r\nthe Mohammedans both against the Christian rayahs and against the foreigner\r\nto whom they had appealed. A wave of religious, of patriotic agitation, of\r\npolitical disquiet, of barbaric fury, passed over the Turkish Empire. On\r\nthe 6th of May the Prussian and the French Consuls at Salonika were\r\nattacked and murdered by the mob. In Smyrna and Constantinople there were\r\nthreatening movements against the European inhabitants; in Bulgaria, the\r\nCircassian settlers and the hordes of irregular troops whom the Government\r\nhad recently sent into that province waited only for the first sign of an\r\nexpected insurrection to fall upon their prey and deluge the land with\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n[The Berlin Memorandum, May 13.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as it became evident that peace was not to be produced by Count\r\nAndrássy's Note, the Ministers of the three Empires determined to meet one\r\nanother with the view of arranging further diplomatic steps to be taken in\r\ncommon. Berlin, which the Czar was about to visit, was chosen as the\r\nmeeting-place; the date of the meeting was fixed for the second week in\r\nMay. It was in the interval between the despatch of Prince Bismarck's\r\ninvitation and the arrival of the Czar, with Prince Gortschakoff and Count\r\nAndrássy, that intelligence came of the murder of the Prussian and French\r\nConsuls at Salonika. This event gave a deeper seriousness to the\r\ndeliberations now held. The Ministers declared that if the representatives\r\nof two foreign Powers could be thus murdered in broad daylight in a\r\npeaceful town under the eyes of the powerless authorities, the Christians\r\nof the insurgent provinces might well decline to entrust themselves to an\r\nexasperated enemy. An effective guarantee for the execution of the promises\r\nmade by the Porte had become absolutely necessary. The conclusions of the\r\nMinisters were embodied in a Memorandum, which declared that an armistice\r\nof two months must be imposed on the combatants; that the mixed Commission\r\nmentioned in the Andrássy Note must be at once called into being, with a\r\nChristian native of Herzegovina at its head; and that the reforms promised\r\nby the Porte must be carried out under the superintendence of the\r\nrepresentatives of the European Powers. If before the end of the armistice\r\nthe Porte should not have given its assent to these terms, the Imperial\r\nCourts declared that they must support these diplomatic efforts by measures\r\nof a more effective character. [547]\r\n\r\n[England alone rejects the Berlin Memorandum.]\r\n\r\nOn the same day that this Memorandum was signed, Prince Bismarck invited\r\nthe British, the French, and Italian Ambassadors to meet the Russian and\r\nthe Austrian Chancellors at his residence. They did so. The Memorandum was\r\nread, and an urgent request was made that Great Britain France, and Italy\r\nwould combine with the Imperial Courts in support of the Berlin Memorandum\r\nas they had in support of the Andrássy Note. As Prince Gortschakoff and\r\nAndrássy were staying in Berlin only for two days longer, it was hoped that\r\nanswers might be received by telegraph within forty-eight hours. Within\r\nthat time answers arrived from the French and Italian Governments accepting\r\nthe Berlin Memorandum; the reply from London did not arrive till five days\r\nlater; it announced the refusal of the Government to join in the course\r\nproposed. Pending further negotiations on this subject, French, German,\r\nAustrian, Italian, and Russian ships of war were sent to Salonika to\r\nenforce satisfaction for the murder of the Consuls. The Cabinet of London,\r\ndeclining to associate itself with the concert of the Powers, and stating\r\nthat Great Britain, while intending nothing in the nature of a menace,\r\ncould not permit territorial changes to be made in the East without its own\r\nconsent, despatched the fleet to Besika Bay.\r\n\r\n[Abdul Aziz deposed, May 29.]\r\n\r\n[Massacres in Bulgaria.]\r\n\r\n[Servia and Montenegro declare war, July 2.]\r\n\r\nUp to this time little attention had been paid in England to the revolt of\r\nthe Christian subjects of the Porte or its effect on European politics.\r\nNow, however, a series of events began which excited the interest and even\r\nthe passion of the English people in an extraordinary degree. The ferment\r\nin Constantinople was deepening. On the 29th of May the Sultan Abdul Aziz\r\nwas deposed by Midhat Pasha and Hussein Avni, the former the chief of the\r\nparty of reform, the latter the representative of the older Turkish\r\nmilitary and patriotic spirit which Abdul Aziz had incensed by his\r\nsubserviency to Russia. A few days later the deposed Sultan was murdered.\r\nHussein Avni and another rival of Midhat were assassinated by a desperado\r\nas they sat at the council; Murad V., who had been raised to the throne,\r\nproved imbecile; and Midhat, the destined regenerator of the Ottoman Empire\r\nas many outside Turkey believed, grasped all but the highest power in the\r\nState. Towards the end of June reports reached western Europe of the\r\nrepression of an insurrection in Bulgaria with measures of atrocious\r\nviolence. Servia and Montenegro, long active in support of their kinsmen\r\nwho were in arms, declared war. The reports from Bulgaria, at first vague,\r\ntook more definite form; and at length the correspondents of German as well\r\nas English newspapers, making their way to the district south of the\r\nBalkans, found in villages still strewed with skeletons and human remains\r\nthe terrible evidence of what had passed. The British Ministry, relying\r\nupon the statements of Sir H. Elliot, Ambassador at Constantinople, at\r\nfirst denied the seriousness of the massacres: they directed, however, that\r\ninvestigations should be made on the spot by a member of the Embassy; and\r\nMr. Baring, Secretary of Legation, was sent to Bulgaria with this duty.\r\nBaring's report confirmed the accounts which his chief had refused to\r\nbelieve, and placed the number of the victims, rightly or wrongly, at not\r\nless than twelve thousand. [548]\r\n\r\n[Opinion in England.]\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarian massacres acted on Europe in 1876 as the massacre of Chios\r\nhad acted on Europe in 1822. In England especially they excited the deepest\r\nhorror, and completely changed the tone of public opinion towards the Turk.\r\nHitherto the public mind had scarcely been conscious of the questions that\r\nwere at issue in the East. Herzegovina, Bosnia, Bulgaria, were not familiar\r\nnames like Greece; the English people hardly knew where these countries\r\nwere, or that they were not inhabited by Turks. The Crimean War had left\r\nbehind it the tradition of friendship with the Sultan; it needed some\r\nlightning-flash, some shock penetrating all ranks of society, to dispel\r\nonce and for all the conventional idea of Turkey as a community resembling\r\na European State, and to bring home to the English people the true\r\ncondition of the Christian races of the Balkan under their Ottoman masters.\r\nBut this the Bulgarian massacres effectively did; and from this time the\r\ngreat mass of the English people, who had sympathised so strongly with the\r\nItalians and the Hungarians in their struggle for national independence,\r\nwere not disposed to allow the influence of Great Britain to be used for\r\nthe perpetuation of Turkish ascendency over the Slavic races. There is\r\nlittle doubt that if in the autumn of 1876 the nation had had the\r\nopportunity of expressing its views by a Parliamentary election, it would\r\nhave insisted on the adoption of active measures in concert with the Powers\r\nwhich were prepared to force reform upon the Porte. But the Parliament of\r\n1876 was but two years old; the majority which supported the Government was\r\nstill unbroken; and at the head of the Cabinet there was a man gifted with\r\nextraordinary tenacity of purpose, with great powers of command over\r\nothers, and with a clear, cold, untroubled apprehension of the line of\r\nconduct which he intended to pursue. It was one of the strangest features\r\nof this epoch that a Minister who in a long career had never yet exercised\r\nthe slightest influence upon foreign affairs, and who was not himself\r\nEnglish by birth, should have impressed in such an extreme degree the stamp\r\nof his own individuality upon the conduct of our foreign policy; that he\r\nshould have forced England to the very front in the crisis through which\r\nEurope was passing; and that, for good or for evil, he should have reversed\r\nthe tendency which since the Italian war of 1859 had seemed ever to be\r\ndrawing England further and further away from Continental affairs.\r\n\r\n[Disraeli.]\r\n\r\nDisraeli's conception of Parliamentary politics was an ironical one. It had\r\npleased the British nation that the leadership of one of its great\r\npolitical parties should be won by a man of genius only on the condition of\r\naccommodating himself to certain singular fancies of his contemporaries;\r\nand for twenty years, from the time of his attacks upon Sir Robert Peel for\r\nthe abolition of the corn-laws down to the time when he educated his party\r\ninto the democratic Reform Bill of 1867, Disraeli with an excellent grace\r\nsuited himself to the somewhat strange parts which he was required to play.\r\nBut after 1874, when he was placed in office at the head of a powerful\r\nmajority in both Houses of Parliament and of a submissive Cabinet, the\r\nantics ended; the epoch of statesmanship, and of statesmanship based on the\r\nleader's own individual thought not on the commonplace of public creeds,\r\nbegan. At a time when Cavour was rice-growing and Bismarck unknown outside\r\nhis own county, Disraeli had given to the world in Tancred his visions of\r\nEastern Empire. Mysterious chieftains planned the regeneration of Asia by a\r\nnew crusade of Arab and Syrian votaries of the one living faith, and\r\nlightly touched on the transfer of Queen Victoria's Court from London to\r\nDelhi. Nothing indeed is perfect; and Disraeli's eye was favoured with such\r\nextraordinary perceptions of the remote that it proved a little uncertain\r\nin its view of matters not quite without importance nearer home. He thought\r\nthe attempt to establish Italian independence a misdemeanour; he listened\r\nto Bismarck's ideas on the future of Germany, and described them as the\r\nvapourings of a German baron. For a quarter of a century Disraeli had\r\ndazzled and amused the House of Commons without, as it seemed, drawing\r\ninspiration from any one great cause or discerning any one of the political\r\ngoals towards which the nations of Europe were tending. At length, however,\r\nthe time came for the realisation of his own imperial policy; and before\r\nthe Eastern question had risen conspicuously above the horizon in Europe,\r\nDisraeli, as Prime Minister of England, had begun to act in Asia and\r\nAfrica. He sent the Prince of Wales to hold Durbars and to hunt tigers\r\namongst the Hindoos; he proclaimed the Queen Empress of India; he purchased\r\nthe Khedive's shares in the Suez Canal. Thus far it had been uncertain\r\nwhether there was much in the Minister's policy beyond what was theatrical\r\nand picturesque; but when a great part of the nation began to ask for\r\nintervention on behalf of the Eastern Christians against the Turks, they\r\nfound out that Disraeli's purpose was solid enough. Animated by a deep\r\ndistrust and fear of Russia, he returned to what had been the policy of\r\nTory Governments in the days before Canning, the identification of British\r\ninterests with the maintenance of Ottoman power. If a generation of\r\nsentimentalists were willing to sacrifice the grandeur of an Empire to\r\ntheir sympathies with an oppressed people, it was not Disraeli who would be\r\ntheir instrument. When the massacre of Batak was mentioned in the House of\r\nCommons, he dwelt on the honourable qualities of the Circassians; when\r\ninstances of torture were alleged, he remarked that an oriental people\r\ngenerally terminated its connection with culprits in a more expeditious\r\nmanner. [549] There were indeed Englishmen enough who loved their country\r\nas well as Disraeli, and who had proved their love by sacrifices which\r\nDisraeli had not had occasion to make, who thought it humiliating that the\r\ngreatness of England should be purchased by the servitude and oppression of\r\nother races, and that the security of their Empire should be deemed to rest\r\non so miserable a thing as Turkish rule. These were considerations to which\r\nDisraeli did not attach much importance. He believed the one thing needful\r\nto be the curbing of Russia; and, unlike Canning, who held that Russia\r\nwould best be kept in check by England's own armed co-operation with it in\r\nestablishing the independence of Greece, he declined from the first to\r\nentertain any project of imposing reform on the Sultan by force, doubting\r\nonly to what extent it would be possible for him to support the Sultan in\r\nresistance to other Powers. According to his own later statement he would\r\nhimself, had he been left unfettered, have definitely informed the Czar\r\nthat if he should make war upon the Porte England would act as its ally.\r\nPublic opinion in England, however, rendered this course impossible. The\r\nknife of Circassian and Bashi-Bazouk had severed the bond with Great\r\nBritain which had saved Turkey in 1854. Disraeli--henceforward Earl of\r\nBeaconsfield--could only utter grim anathemas against Servia for presuming\r\nto draw the sword upon its rightful lord and master, and chide those\r\nimpatient English who, like the greater man whose name is associated with\r\nBeaconsfield, considered that the world need not be too critical as to the\r\nmeans of getting rid of such an evil as Ottoman rule. [550]\r\n\r\n[Meeting and Treaty of Reichstadt, July 8.]\r\n\r\n[The Servian Campaign, July-Oct.]\r\n\r\n[Russian enforces an armistice, Oct. 30.]\r\n\r\nThe rejection by England of the Berlin Memorandum and the proclamation of\r\nwar by Servia and Montenegro were followed by the closer union of the\r\nthree Imperial Courts. The Czar and the Emperor Francis Joseph, with\r\ntheir Ministers, met at Reichstadt in Bohemia on the 8th of July.\r\nAccording to official statements the result of the meeting was that the\r\ntwo sovereigns determined upon non-intervention for the present, and\r\nproposed only to renew the attempt to unite all the Christian Powers in a\r\ncommon policy when some definite occasion should arise. Rumours, however,\r\nwhich proved to be correct, went abroad that something of the nature of\r\nan eventual partition of European Turkey had been the object of\r\nnegotiation. A Treaty had in fact been signed providing that if Russia\r\nshould liberate Bulgaria by arms, Austria should enter into possession of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. The neutrality of Austria had virtually been\r\npurchased at this price, and Russia had thus secured freedom of action in\r\nthe event of the necessary reforms not being forced upon Turkey by the\r\nconcert of Europe. Sooner perhaps than Prince Gortschakoff had expected,\r\nthe religious enthusiasm of the Russian people and their sympathy for\r\ntheir kinsmen and fellow-believers beyond the Danube forced the Czar into\r\nvigorous action. In spite of the assistance of several thousands of\r\nRussian volunteers and of the leadership of the Russian General\r\nTchernaieff, the Servians were defeated in their struggle with the Turks.\r\nThe mediation of England was in vain tendered to the Porte on the only\r\nterms on which even at London peace was seen to be possible, the\r\nmaintenance of the existing rights of Servia and the establishment of\r\nprovincial autonomy in Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Bulgaria. After a brief\r\nsuspension of hostilities in September war was renewed. The Servians were\r\ndriven from their positions; Alexinatz was captured, the road to Belgrade\r\nlay open, and the doom of Bulgaria seemed likely to descend upon the\r\nconquered Principality. The Turks offered indeed a five months' armistice,\r\nwhich would have saved them the risks of a winter campaign and enabled\r\nthem to crush their enemy with accumulated forces in the following\r\nspring. This, by the advice of Russia, the Servians refused to accept. On\r\nthe 30th of October a Russian ultimatum was handed in at Constantinople\r\nby the Ambassador Ignatieff, requiring within forty-eight hours the grant\r\nto Servia of an armistice for two months and the cessation of hostilities.\r\nThe Porte submitted; and wherever Slav and Ottoman stood facing one\r\nanother in arms, in Herzegovina and Bosnia as well as Servia and\r\nMontenegro, there was a pause in the struggle.\r\n\r\n[Declaration of the Czar, Nov. 2.]\r\n\r\n[England proposes a Conference.]\r\n\r\nThe imminence of a war between Russia and Turkey in the last days of\r\nOctober and the close connection between Russia and the Servian cause\r\njustified the anxiety of the British Government. This anxiety the Czar\r\nsought to dispel by a frank declaration of his own views. On the 2nd of\r\nNovember he entered into conversation with the British Ambassador, Lord A.\r\nLoftus, and assured him on his word of honour that he had no intention of\r\nacquiring Constantinople; that if it should be necessary for him to occupy\r\npart of Bulgaria his army would remain there only until peace was restored\r\nand the security of the Christian population established; and, generally,\r\nthat he desired nothing more earnestly than a complete accord between\r\nEngland and Russia in the maintenance of European peace and the improvement\r\nof the condition of the Christian population in Turkey. He stated, however,\r\nwith perfect clearness that if the Porte should continue to refuse the\r\nreforms demanded by Europe, and the Powers should put up with its continued\r\nrefusal, Russia would act alone. Disclaiming in words of great earnestness\r\nall desire for territorial aggrandisement, he protested against the\r\nsuspicion with which his policy was regarded in England, and desired that\r\nhis words might be made public in England as a message of peace. [551] Lord\r\nDerby, then Foreign Secretary, immediately expressed the satisfaction with\r\nwhich the Government had received these assurances; and on the following\r\nday an invitation was sent from London to all the European Powers proposing\r\na Conference at Constantinople, on the basis of a common recognition of the\r\nintegrity of the Ottoman Empire, accompanied by a disavowal on the part of\r\neach of the Powers of all aims at aggrandisement or separate advantage. In\r\nproposing this Conference the Government acted in conformity with the\r\nexpressed desire of the Czar. But there were two voices within the Cabinet.\r\nLord Beaconsfield, had it been in his power, would have informed Russia\r\ncategorically that England would support the Sultan if attacked. This the\r\ncountry and the Cabinet forbade: but the Premier had his own opportunities\r\nof utterance, and at the Guildhall Banquet on the 9th of November, six days\r\nafter the Foreign Secretary had acknowledged the Czar's message of\r\nfriendship, and before this message had been made known to the English\r\npeople, Lord Beaconsfield uttered words which, if they were not idle\r\nbluster, could have been intended only as a menace to the Czar or as an\r\nappeal to the war-party at home:--\"Though the policy of England is peace,\r\nthere is no country so well prepared for war as our own. If England enters\r\ninto conflict in a righteous cause, her resources are inexhaustible. She is\r\nnot a country that when she enters into a campaign has to ask herself\r\nwhether she can support a second or a third campaign. She enters into a\r\ncampaign which she will not terminate till right is done.\"\r\n\r\n[Project of Ottoman Constitution.]\r\n\r\nThe proposal made by the Earl of Derby for a Conference at Constantinople\r\nwas accepted by all the Powers, and accepted on the bases specified. Lord\r\nSalisbury, then Secretary of State for India, was appointed to represent\r\nGreat Britain in conjunction with Sir H. Elliot, its Ambassador. The\r\nMinister made his journey to Constantinople by way of the European\r\ncapitals, and learnt at Berlin that the good understanding between the\r\nGerman Emperor and the Czar extended to Eastern affairs. Whether the\r\nBritish Government had as yet gained any trustworthy information on the\r\nTreaty of Reichstadt is doubtful; but so far as the public eye could judge,\r\nthere was now, in spite of the tone assumed by Lord Beaconsfield, a fairer\r\nprospect of the solution of the Eastern question by the establishment of\r\nsome form of autonomy in the Christian provinces than there had been at any\r\nprevious time. The Porte itself recognised the serious intention of the\r\nPowers, and, in order to forestall the work of the Conference, prepared a\r\nscheme of constitutional reform that far surpassed the wildest claims of\r\nHerzegovinian or of Serb. Nothing less than a complete system of\r\nParliamentary Government, with the very latest ingenuities from France and\r\nBelgium, was to be granted to the entire Ottoman Empire. That Midhat Pasha,\r\nwho was the author of this scheme, may have had some serious end in view is\r\nnot impossible; but with the mass of Palace-functionaries at Constantinople\r\nit was simply a device for embarrassing the West with its own inventions;\r\nand the action of men in power, both great and small, continued after the\r\nconstitution had come into nominal existence to be exactly what it had been\r\nbefore. The very terms of the constitution must have been unintelligible to\r\nall but those who had been employed at foreign courts. The Government might\r\nas well have announced its intention of clothing the Balkans with the flora\r\nof the deep sea.\r\n\r\n[Demands settled at the Preliminary Conference, Dec. 11-21.]\r\n\r\nIn the second week of December the representatives of the six Great Powers\r\nassembled at Constantinople. In order that the demands of Europe should be\r\npresented to the Porte with unanimity, they determined to hold a series of\r\npreliminary meetings with one another before the formal opening of the\r\nConference and before communicating with the Turks. At these meetings,\r\nafter Ignatieff had withdrawn his proposal for a Russian occupation of\r\nBulgaria, complete accord was attained. It was resolved to demand the\r\ncession of certain small districts by the Porte to Servia and Montenegro;\r\nthe grant of administrative autonomy to Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Bulgaria;\r\nthe appointment in each of these provinces of Christian governors, whose\r\nterms of office should be for five years, and whose nomination should be\r\nsubject to the approval of the Powers; the confinement of Turkish troops to\r\nthe fortresses; the removal of the bands of Circassians to Asia; and\r\nfinally the execution of these reforms under the superintendence of an\r\nInternational Commission, which should have at its disposal a corps of six\r\nthousand gendarmes to be enlisted in Switzerland or Belgium. By these\r\narrangements, while the Sultan retained his sovereignty and the integrity\r\nof the Ottoman Empire remained unimpaired, it was conceived that the\r\nChristian population would be effectively secured against Turkish violence\r\nand caprice.\r\n\r\n[The Turks refuse the demands of the Conference, Jan. 20, 1877.]\r\n\r\nAll differences between the representatives of the European Powers having\r\nbeen removed, the formal Conference was opened on the 23rd of December\r\nunder the presidency of the Turkish Foreign Minister, Savfet Pasha. The\r\nproceedings had not gone far when they were interrupted by the roar of\r\ncannon. Savfet explained that the new Ottoman constitution was being\r\npromulgated, and that the salvo which the members of the Conference heard\r\nannounced the birth of an era of universal happiness and prosperity in the\r\nSultan's dominions. It soon appeared that in the presence of this great\r\npanacea there was no place for the reforming efforts of the Christian\r\nPowers. Savfet declared from the first that, whatever concessions might be\r\nmade on other points, the Sultan's Government would never consent to the\r\nestablishment of a Foreign Commission to superintend the execution of its\r\nreforms, nor to the joint action of the Powers in the appointment of the\r\ngovernors of its provinces. It was in vain argued that without such\r\nforeign control Europe possessed no guarantee that the promises and the\r\ngood intentions of the Porte, however gratifying these might be, would be\r\ncarried into effect. Savfet replied that by the Treaty of 1856 the Powers\r\nhad declared the Ottoman Empire to stand on exactly the same footing as\r\nany other great State in Europe, and had expressly debarred themselves\r\nfrom interfering, under whatever circumstances, with its internal\r\nadministration. The position of the Turkish representative at the\r\nConference was in fact the only logical one. In the Treaty of Paris the\r\nPowers had elaborately pledged themselves to an absurdity; and this\r\nTreaty the Turk was never weary of throwing in their faces. But the\r\nsituation was not one for lawyers and for the interpretation of\r\ndocuments. The Conference, after hearing the arguments and the\r\ncounter-projects of the Turkish Ministers, after reconsidering its own\r\ndemands and modifying these in many important points in deference to\r\nOttoman wishes, adhered to the demand for a Foreign Commission and for a\r\nEuropean control over the appointment of governors. Midhat, who was now\r\nGrand Vizier, summoned the Great Council of the Empire, and presented to\r\nit the demands of the Conference. These demands the Great Council\r\nunanimously rejected. Lord Salisbury had already warned the Sultan what\r\nwould be the results of continued obstinacy; and after receiving Midhat's\r\nfinal reply the ambassadors of all the Powers, together with the envoys\r\nwho had been specially appointed for the Conference, quitted\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\n[The London Protocol, Mar. 31.]\r\n\r\n[The Porte rejects the Protocol.]\r\n\r\n[Russia declares war, April 24.]\r\n\r\nRussia, since the beginning of November, had been actively preparing for\r\nwar. The Czar had left the world in no doubt as to his own intentions in\r\ncase of the failure of the European Concert; it only remained for him to\r\nascertain whether, after the settlement of a definite scheme of reform by\r\nthe Conference and the rejection of this scheme by the Porte, the Powers\r\nwould or would not take steps to enforce their conclusion. England\r\nsuggested that the Sultan should be allowed a year to carry out his good\r\nintentions: Gortschakoff inquired whether England would pledge itself to\r\naction if, at the end of the year, reform was not effected; but no such\r\npledge was forthcoming. With the object either of discovering some\r\narrangement in which the Powers would combine, or of delaying the outbreak\r\nof war until the Russian preparations were more advanced and the season\r\nmore favourable, Ignatieff was sent round to all the European Courts. He\r\nvisited England, and subsequently drew up, with the assistance of Count\r\nSchouvaloff, Russian Ambassador at London, a document which gained the\r\napproval of the British as well as the Continental Governments. This\r\ndocument, known as the London Protocol, was signed on the 31st of March.\r\nAfter a reference to the promises of reform made by the Porte, it stated\r\nthat the Powers intended to watch carefully by their representatives over\r\nthe manner in which these promises were carried into effect; that if their\r\nhopes should be once more disappointed they should regard the condition of\r\naffairs as incompatible with the interests of Europe; and that in such case\r\nthey would decide in common upon the means best fitted to secure the\r\nwell-being of the Christian population and the interests of general peace.\r\nDeclarations relative to the disarmament of Russia, which it was now the\r\nprincipal object of the British Government to effect, were added. There was\r\nindeed so little of a substantial engagement in this Protocol that it would\r\nhave been surprising had Russia disarmed without obtaining some further\r\nguarantee for the execution of reform. But weak as the Protocol was, it was\r\nrejected by the Porte. Once more the appeal was made to the Treaty of\r\nParis, once more the Sultan protested against the encroachment of the\r\nPowers on his own inviolable rights. Lord Beaconsfield's Cabinet even now\r\ndenied that the last word had been spoken, and professed to entertain some\r\nhope in the effect of subsequent diplomatic steps; but the rest of Europe\r\nasked and expected no further forbearance on the part of Russia. The army\r\nof operations already lay on the Pruth: the Grand Duke Nicholas, brother of\r\nthe Czar, was appointed to its command; and on the 24th of April the\r\nRussian Government issued its declaration of war.\r\n\r\n[Passage of the Danube, June 27.]\r\n\r\n[Advance on the Balkans, July.]\r\n\r\n[Gourko south of the Balkans, July 15.]\r\n\r\nBetween the Russian frontier and the Danube lay the Principality of\r\nRoumania. A convention signed before the outbreak of hostilities gave to\r\nthe Russian army a free passage through this territory, and Roumania\r\nsubsequently entered the war as Russia's ally. It was not, however, until\r\nthe fourth week of June that the invaders were able to cross the Danube.\r\nSeven army-corps were assembled in Roumania; of these one crossed the Lower\r\nDanube into the Dobrudscha, two were retained in Roumania as a reserve, and\r\nfour crossed the river in the neighbourhood of Sistowa, in order to enter\r\nupon the Bulgarian campaign. It was the desire of the Russians to throw\r\nforward the central part of their army by the line of the river Jantra upon\r\nthe Balkans; with their left to move against Rustchuk and the Turkish\r\narmies in the eastern fortresses of Bulgaria; with their right to capture\r\nNicopolis, and guard the central column against any flank attack from the\r\nwest. But both in Europe and in Asia the Russians had underrated the power\r\nof their adversary, and entered upon the war with insufficient forces.\r\nAdvantages won by their generals on the Armenian frontier while the\r\nEuropean army was still marching through Roumania were lost in the course\r\nof the next few weeks. Bayazid and other places that fell into the hands of\r\nthe Russians at the first onset were recovered by the Turks under Mukhtar\r\nPasha; and within a few days after the opening of the European campaign the\r\nRussian divisions in Asia were everywhere retreating upon their own\r\nfrontier. The Bulgarian campaign was marked by the same rapid successes of\r\nthe invader at the outset, to be followed, owing to the same insufficiency\r\nof force, by similar disasters. Encountering no effective opposition on the\r\nDanube, the Russians pushed forward rapidly towards the Balkans by the line\r\nof the Jantra. The Turkish army lay scattered in the Bulgarian fortresses,\r\nfrom Widdin in the extreme west to Shumla at the foot of the Eastern\r\nBalkans. It was considered by the Russian commanders that two army-corps\r\nwould be required to operate against the Turks in Eastern Bulgaria, while\r\none corps would be enough to cover the central line of invasion from the\r\nwest. There remained, excluding the two corps in reserve in Roumania and\r\nthe corps holding the Dobrudscha, but one corps for the march on the\r\nBalkans and Adrianople. The command of the vanguard of this body was given\r\nto General Gourko, who pressed on into the Balkans, seized the Shipka Pass,\r\nand descended into Southern Bulgaria (July 15). The Turks were driven from\r\nKesanlik and Eski Sagra, and Gourko's cavalry, a few hundreds in number,\r\nadvanced to within two days' march of Adrianople.\r\n\r\n[Osman occupies Plevna, July 19.]\r\n\r\n[First engagement at Plevna, July 20.]\r\n\r\n[Second battle at Plevna, July 30.]\r\n\r\n[The Shipka Pass, Aug. 20-23.]\r\n\r\nThe headquarters of the whole Russian army were now at Tirnova, the ancient\r\nBulgarian capital, about half-way between the Danube and the Balkans. Two\r\narmy-corps, commanded by the Czarewitch, moved eastwards against Rustchuk\r\nand the so-called Turkish army of the Danube, which was gathering behind\r\nthe lines of the Kara Lom; another division, under General Krudener, turned\r\nwestward and captured Nicopolis with its garrison. Lovatz and other points\r\nlying westward of the Jantra were occupied by weak detachments; but so\r\nbadly were the reconnaissances of the Russians performed in this direction\r\nthat they were unaware of the approach of a Turkish army from Widdin,\r\nthirty-five thousand strong, till this was close on their flank. Before the\r\nRussians could prevent him, Osman Pasha, with the vanguard of this army,\r\nhad occupied the town and heights of Plevna, between Nicopolis and Lovatz.\r\nOn the 20th of July, still unaware of their enemy's strength, the Russians\r\nattacked him at Plevna: they were defeated with considerable loss, and\r\nafter a few days one of Osman's divisions, pushing forward upon the\r\ninvader's central line, drove them out of Lovatz. The Grand Duke now sent\r\nreinforcements to Krudener, and ordered him to take Plevna at all costs.\r\nKrudener's strength was raised to thirty-five thousand; but in the meantime\r\nnew Turkish regiments had joined Osman, and his troops, now numbering about\r\nfifty thousand, had been working day and night entrenching themselves in\r\nthe heights round Plevna which the Russians had to attack. The assault was\r\nmade on the 30th of July; it was beaten back with terrible slaughter, the\r\nRussians leaving a fifth of their number on the field. Had Osman taken up\r\nthe offensive and the Turkish commander on the Lom pressed vigorously upon\r\nthe invader's line, it would probably have gone ill with the Russian army\r\nin Bulgaria. Gourko was at once compelled to abandon the country south of\r\nthe Balkans. His troops, falling back upon the Shipka Pass, were there\r\nattacked from the south by far superior forces under Suleiman Pasha. The\r\nOttoman commander, prodigal of the lives of his men and trusting to mere\r\nblindfold violence, hurled his army day after day against the Russian\r\npositions (Aug. 20-23). There was a moment when all seemed lost, and the\r\nRussian soldiers sent to their Czar the last message of devotion from men\r\nwho were about to die at their post. But in the extremity of peril there\r\narrived a reinforcement, weak, but sufficient to turn the scale against the\r\nill-commanded Turks. Suleiman's army withdrew to the village of Shipka at\r\nthe southern end of the pass. The pass itself, with the entrance from\r\nnorthern Bulgaria, remained in the hands of the Russians.\r\n\r\n[Roumania.]\r\n\r\n[Third battle of Plevna, Sept 11-12.]\r\n\r\nAfter the second battle of Plevna it became clear that the Russians could\r\nnot carry on the campaign with their existing forces. Two army-corps were\r\ncalled up which were guarding the coast of the Black Sea; several others\r\nwere mobilised in the interior of Russia, and began their journey towards\r\nthe Danube. So urgent, however, was the immediate need, that the Czar was\r\ncompelled to ask help from Roumania. This help was given. Roumanian troops,\r\nexcellent in quality, filled up the gap caused by Krudener's defeats, and\r\nthe whole army before Plevna was placed under the command of the Roumanian\r\nPrince Charles. At the beginning of September the Russians were again ready\r\nfor action. Lovatz was wrested from the Turks, and the division which had\r\ncaptured it moved on to Plevna to take part in a great combined attack.\r\nThis attack was made on the 11th of September under the eyes of the Czar.\r\nOn the north the Russians and Roumanians together, after a desperate\r\nstruggle, stormed the Grivitza redoubt. On the south Skobeleff carried the\r\nfirst Turkish position, but could make no impression on their second line\r\nof defence. Twelve thousand men fell on the Russian side before the day was\r\nover, and the main defences of the Turks were still unbroken. On the morrow\r\nthe Turks took up the offensive. Skobeleff, exposed to the attack of a far\r\nsuperior foe, prayed in vain for reinforcements. His men, standing in the\r\npositions that they had won from the Turks, repelled one onslaught after\r\nanother, but were ultimately overwhelmed and driven from the field. At the\r\nclose of the second day's battle the Russians were everywhere beaten back\r\nwithin their own lines, except at the Grivitza redoubt, which was itself\r\nbut an outwork of the Turkish defences, and faced by more formidable works\r\nwithin. The assailants had sustained a loss approaching that of the Germans\r\nat Gravelotte with an army one-third of the Germans' strength. Osman was\r\nstronger than at the beginning of the campaign; with what sacrifices Russia\r\nwould have to purchase its ultimate victory no man could calculate.\r\n\r\n[Todleben besieges Plevna.]\r\n\r\n[Fall of Plevna, Dec. 10.]\r\n\r\nThe three defeats at Plevna cast a sinister light upon the Russian military\r\nadministration and the quality of its chiefs. The soldiers had fought\r\nheroically; divisional generals like Skobeleff had done all that man could\r\ndo in such positions; the faults were those of the headquarters and the\r\nofficers by whom the Imperial Family were surrounded. After the third\r\ncatastrophe, public opinion called for the removal of the authors of these\r\ndisasters and the employment of abler men. Todleben, the defender of\r\nSebastopol, who for some unknown reason had been left without a command,\r\nwas now summoned to Bulgaria, and virtually placed at the head of the army\r\nbefore Plevna. He saw that the stronghold of Osman could only be reduced by\r\na regular siege, and prepared to draw his lines right round it. For a time\r\nOsman kept open his communications with the south-west, and heavy trains of\r\nammunition and supplies made their way into Plevna from this direction; but\r\nthe investment was at length completed, and the army of Plevna cut off from\r\nthe world. In the meantime new regiments were steadily pouring into\r\nBulgaria from the interior of Russia. East of the Jantra, after many\r\nalternations of fortune, the Turks were finally driven back behind the\r\nriver Lom. The last efforts of Suleiman failed to wrest the Shipka Pass\r\nfrom its defenders. From the narrow line which the invaders had with such\r\ndifficulty held during three anxious months their forces, accumulating day\r\nby day, spread out south and west up to the slopes of the Balkans, ready to\r\nburst over the mountain-barrier and sweep the enemy back to the walls of\r\nConstantinople when once Plevna should have fallen and the army which\r\nbesieged it should be added to the invader's strength. At length, in the\r\nsecond week of December, Osman's supply of food was exhausted. Victor in\r\nthree battles, he refused to surrender without one more struggle. On the\r\n10th of December, after distributing among his men what there remained of\r\nprovisions, he made a desperate effort to break out towards the west. His\r\ncolumns dashed in vain against the besieger's lines; behind him his enemies\r\npressed forward into the positions which he had abandoned; a ring of fire\r\nlike that of Sedan surrounded the Turkish army; and after thousands had\r\nfallen in a hopeless conflict, the general and the troops who for five\r\nmonths had held in check the collected forces of the Russian Empire\r\nsurrendered to their conqueror.\r\n\r\n[Crossing of the Balkans, Dec. 25-Jan. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Capitulation of Shipka, Jan. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Russians enter Adrianople, Jan. 20, 1878.]\r\n\r\nIf in the first stages of the war there was little that did credit to\r\nRussia's military capacity, the energy that marked its close made amends\r\nfor what had gone before. Winter was descending in extreme severity: the\r\nBalkans were a mass of snow and ice; but no obstacle could now bar the\r\ninvader's march. Gourko, in command of an army that had gathered to the\r\nsouth-west of Plevna, made his way through the mountains above Etropol in\r\nthe last days of December, and, driving the Turks from Sophia, pressed on\r\ntowards Philippopolis and Adrianople. Farther east two columns crossed the\r\nBalkans by bye-paths right and left of the Shipka Pass, and then,\r\nconverging on Shipka itself, fell upon the rear of the Turkish army which\r\nstill blocked the southern outlet. Simultaneously a third corps marched\r\ndown the pass from the north and assailed the Turks in front. After a\r\nfierce struggle the entire Turkish army, thirty-five thousand strong, laid\r\ndown its arms. There now remained only one considerable force between the\r\ninvaders and Constantinople. This body, which was commanded by Suleiman,\r\nheld the road which runs along the valley of the Maritza, at a point\r\nsomewhat to the east of Philippopolis. Against it Gourko advanced from the\r\nwest, while the victors of Shipka, descending due south through Kesanlik,\r\nbarred the line of retreat towards Adrianople. The last encounter of the\r\nwar took place on the 17th of January. Suleiman's army, routed and\r\ndemoralised, succeeded in making its escape to the Ægæan coast. Pursuit was\r\nunnecessary, for the war was now practically over. On the 20th of January\r\nthe Russians made their entry into Adrianople; in the next few days their\r\nadvanced guard touched the Sea of Marmora at Rodosto.\r\n\r\n[Armistice, Jan. 31.]\r\n\r\nImmediately after the fall of Plevna the Porte had applied to the European\r\nPowers for their mediation. Disasters in Asia had already warned it not to\r\ndelay submission too long; for in the middle of October Mukhtar Pasha had\r\nbeen driven from his positions, and a month later Kars had been taken by\r\nstorm. The Russians had subsequently penetrated into Armenia and had\r\ncaptured the outworks of Erzeroum. Each day that now passed brought the\r\nOttoman Empire nearer to destruction. Servia again declared war; the\r\nMontenegrins made themselves masters of the coast-towns and of\r\nborder-territory north and south; Greece seemed likely to enter into the\r\nstruggle. Baffled in his attempt to gain the common mediation of the\r\nPowers, the Sultan appealed to the Queen of England personally for her good\r\noffices in bringing the conflict to a close. In reply to a telegram from\r\nLondon, the Czar declared himself willing to treat for peace as soon as\r\ndirect communications should be addressed to his representatives by the\r\nPorte. On the 14th of January commissioners were sent to the headquarters\r\nof the Grand Duke Nicholas at Kesanlik to treat for an armistice and for\r\npreliminaries of peace. The Russians, now in the full tide of victory, were\r\nin no hurry to agree with their adversary. Nicholas bade the Turkish envoys\r\naccompany him to Adrianople, and it was not until the 31st of January that\r\nthe armistice was granted and the preliminaries of peace signed.\r\n\r\n[England.]\r\n\r\n[Vote of Credit, Jan. 28-Feb. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Fleet passes the Dardanelles, Feb. 6.]\r\n\r\nWhile the Turkish envoys were on their journey to the Russian headquarters,\r\nthe session of Parliament opened at London. The Ministry had declared at\r\nthe outbreak of the war that Great Britain would remain neutral unless its\r\nown interests should be imperilled, and it had defined these interests with\r\ndue clearness both in its communications with the Russian Ambassador and in\r\nits statements in Parliament. It was laid down that Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment could not permit the blockade of the Suez Canal, or the\r\nextension of military operations to Egypt; that it could not witness with\r\nindifference the passing of Constantinople into other hands than those of\r\nits present possessors; and that it would entertain serious objections to\r\nany material alterations in the rules made under European sanction for the\r\nnavigation of the Bosphorus and Dardanelles. [552] In reply to Lord Derby's\r\nnote which formulated these conditions of neutrality Prince Gortschakoff\r\nhad repeated the Czar's assurance that the acquisition of Constantinople\r\nwas excluded from his views, and had promised to undertake no military\r\noperation in Egypt; he had, however, let it be understood that, as an\r\nincident of warfare, the reduction of Constantinople might be necessary\r\nlike that of any other capital. In the Queen's speech at the opening of\r\nParliament, Ministers stated that the conditions on which the neutrality of\r\nEngland was founded had not hitherto been infringed by either belligerent,\r\nbut that, should hostilities be prolonged, some unexpected occurrence might\r\nrender it necessary to adopt measures of precaution, measures which could\r\nnot be adequately prepared without an appeal to the liberality of\r\nParliament. From language subsequently used by Lord Beaconsfield's\r\ncolleagues, it would appear that the Cabinet had some apprehension that the\r\nRussian army, escaping from the Czar's control, might seize and attempt\r\npermanently to hold Constantinople. On the 23rd of January orders were sent\r\nto Admiral Hornby, commander of the fleet at Besika Bay, to pass the\r\nDardanelles, and proceed to Constantinople. Lord Derby, who saw no\r\nnecessity for measures of a warlike character until the result of the\r\nnegotiations at Adrianople should become known, now resigned office; but on\r\nthe reversal of the order to Admiral Hornby he rejoined the Cabinet. On the\r\n28th of January, after the bases of peace had been communicated by Count\r\nSchouvaloff to the British Government but before they had been actually\r\nsigned, the Chancellor of the Exchequer moved for a vote of £6,000,000 for\r\nincreasing the armaments of the country. This vote was at first vigorously\r\nopposed on the ground that none of the stated conditions of England's\r\nneutrality had been infringed, and that in the conditions of peace between\r\nRussia and Turkey there was nothing that justified a departure from the\r\npolicy which England had hitherto pursued. In the course of the debates,\r\nhowever, a telegram arrived from Mr. Layard, Elliot's successor at\r\nConstantinople, stating that notwithstanding the armistice the Russians\r\nwere pushing on towards the capital; that the Turks had been compelled to\r\nevacuate Silivria on the Sea of Marmora; that the Russian general was about\r\nto occupy Tchataldja, an outpost of the last line of defence not thirty\r\nmiles from Constantinople; and that the Porte was in great alarm, and\r\nunable to understand the Russian proceedings. The utmost excitement was\r\ncaused at Westminster by this telegram. The fleet was at once ordered to\r\nConstantinople. Mr. Forster, who had led the opposition to the vote of\r\ncredit, sought to withdraw his amendment; and although on the following\r\nday, with the arrival of the articles of the armistice, it appeared that\r\nthe Russians were simply moving up to the accepted line of demarcation, and\r\nthat the Porte could hardly have been ignorant of this when Layard's\r\ntelegram was despatched, the alarm raised in London did not subside, and\r\nthe vote of credit was carried by a majority of above two hundred. [553]\r\n\r\n[Imminence of war with England.]\r\n\r\nWhen a victorious army is, without the intervention of some external Power,\r\nchecked in its work of conquest by the negotiation of an armistice, it is\r\ninvariably made a condition that positions shall be handed over to it which\r\nit does not at the moment occupy, but which it might reasonably expect to\r\nhave conquered within a certain date, had hostilities not been suspended.\r\nThe armistice granted to Austria by Napoleon after the battle of Marengo\r\ninvolved the evacuation of the whole of Upper Italy; the armistice which\r\nBismarck offered to the French Government of Defence at the beginning of\r\nthe siege of Paris would have involved the surrender of Strasburg and of\r\nToul. In demanding that the line of demarcation should be carried almost up\r\nto the walls of Constantinople the Russians were asking for no more than\r\nwould certainly have been within their hands had hostilities been prolonged\r\nfor a few weeks, or even days. Deeply as the conditions of the armistice\r\nagitated the English people, it was not in these conditions, but in the\r\nconditions of the peace which was to follow, that the true cause of\r\ncontention between England and Russia, if cause there was, had to be found.\r\nNevertheless, the approach of the Russians to Gallipoli and the lines of\r\nTchataldja, followed, as it was, by the despatch of the British fleet to\r\nConstantinople, brought Russia and Great Britain within a hair's breadth of\r\nwar. It was in vain that Lord Derby described the fleet as sent only for\r\nthe protection of the lives and property of British subjects. Gortschakoff,\r\nwho was superior in amenities of this kind, replied that the Russian\r\nGovernment had exactly the same end in view, with the distinction that its\r\nprotection would be extended to all Christians. Should the British fleet\r\nappear at the Bosphorus, Russian troops would, in the fulfilment of a\r\ncommon duty of humanity, enter Constantinople. Yielding to this threat,\r\nLord Beaconsfield bade the fleet halt at a convenient point in the Sea of\r\nMarmora. On both sides preparations were made for immediate action. The\r\nguns on our ships stood charged for battle; the Russians strewed the\r\nshallows with torpedoes. Had a Russian soldier appeared on the heights of\r\nGallipoli, had an Englishman landed on the Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus,\r\nwar would at once have broken out. But after some weeks of extreme danger\r\nthe perils of mere contiguity passed away, and the decision between peace\r\nand war was transferred from the accidents of tent and quarter deck to the\r\ndeliberations of statesmen assembled in Congress.\r\n\r\n[Treaty of San Stefano, Mar. 3.]\r\n\r\nThe bases of Peace which were made the condition of the armistice granted\r\nat Adrianople formed with little alteration the substance of the Treaty\r\nsigned by Russia and Turkey at San Stefano, a village on the Sea of\r\nMarmora, on the 3rd of March. By this Treaty the Porte recognised the\r\nindependence of Servia, Montenegro, and Roumania, and made considerable\r\ncessions of territory to the two former States. Bulgaria was constituted an\r\nautonomous tributary Principality, with a Christian Government and a\r\nnational militia. Its frontier, which was made so extensive as to include\r\nthe greater part of European Turkey, was defined as beginning near Midia on\r\nthe Black Sea, not sixty miles from the Bosphorus; passing thence westwards\r\njust to the north of Adrianople; descending to the Ægæan Sea, and following\r\nthe coast as far as the Thracian Chersonese; then passing inland westwards,\r\nso as barely to exclude Salonika; running on to the border of Albania\r\nwithin fifty miles of the Adriatic, and from this point following the\r\nAlbanian border up to the new Servian frontier. The Prince of Bulgaria was\r\nto be freely elected by the population, and confirmed by the Porte with the\r\nassent of the Powers; a system of administration was to be drawn up by an\r\nAssembly of Bulgarian notables; and the introduction of the new system into\r\nBulgaria with the superintendence of its working was to be entrusted for\r\ntwo years to a Russian Commissioner. Until the native militia was\r\norganised, Russian troops, not exceeding fifty thousand in number, were to\r\noccupy the country; this occupation, however, was to be limited to a term\r\napproximating to two years. In Bosnia and Herzegovina the proposals laid\r\nbefore the Porte at the first sitting of the Conference of 1876 were to be\r\nimmediately introduced, subject to such modifications as might be agreed\r\nupon between Turkey, Russia, and Austria. The Porte undertook to apply\r\nscrupulously in Crete the Organic Law which had been drawn up in 1868,\r\ntaking into account the previously expressed wishes of the native\r\npopulation. An analogous law, adapted to local requirements, was, after\r\nbeing communicated to the Czar, to be introduced into Epirus, Thessaly, and\r\nthe other parts of Turkey in Europe for which a special constitution was\r\nnot provided by the Treaty. Commissions, in which the native population was\r\nto be largely represented, were in each province to be entrusted with the\r\ntask of elaborating the details of the new organisation. In Armenia the\r\nSultan undertook to carry into effect without further delay the\r\nimprovements and reforms demanded by local requirements, and to guarantee\r\nthe security of the Armenians from Kurds and Circassians. As an indemnity\r\nfor the losses and expenses of the war the Porte admitted itself to be\r\nindebted to Russia in the sum of fourteen hundred million roubles; but in\r\naccordance with the wishes of the Sultan, and in consideration of the\r\nfinancial embarrassments of Turkey, the Czar consented to accept in\r\nsubstitution for the greater part of this sum the cession of the Dobrudscha\r\nin Europe, and of the districts of Ardahan, Kars, Batoum, and Bayazid in\r\nAsia. As to the balance of three hundred million roubles left due to\r\nRussia, the mode of payment or guarantee was to be settled by an\r\nunderstanding between the two Governments. The Dobrudscha was to be given\r\nby the Czar to Roumania in exchange for Bessarabia, which this State was to\r\ntransfer to Russia. The complete evacuation of Turkey in Europe was to take\r\nplace within three months, that of Turkey in Asia within six months, from\r\nthe conclusion of peace. [554]\r\n\r\n[Congress proposed.]\r\n\r\n[Opposite purposes of Russia and England.]\r\n\r\nIt had from the first been admitted by the Russian Government that\r\nquestions affecting the interests of Europe at large could not be settled\r\nby a Treaty between Russia and Turkey alone, but must form the subject of\r\nEuropean agreement. Early in February the Emperor of Austria had proposed\r\nthat a European Conference should assemble at his own capital. It was\r\nsubsequently agreed that Berlin, instead of Vienna, should be the place of\r\nmeeting, and instead of a Conference a Congress should be held, that is, an\r\ninternational assembly of the most solemn form, in which each of the Powers\r\nis represented not merely by an ambassador or an envoy, but by its leading\r\nMinisters. But the question at once arose whether there existed in the mind\r\nof the Russian Government a distinction between parts of the Treaty of San\r\nStefano bearing on the interests of Europe generally and parts which\r\naffected no States but Russia and Turkey; and whether, in this case, Russia\r\nwas willing that Europe should be the judge of the distinction, or, on the\r\ncontrary, claimed for itself the right of withholding portions of the\r\nTreaty from the cognisance of the European Court. In accepting the\r\nprinciple of a Congress, Lord Derby on behalf of Great Britain made it a\r\ncondition that every article of the Treaty without exception should be laid\r\nbefore the Congress, not necessarily as requiring the concurrence of the\r\nPowers, but in order that the Powers themselves might in each case decide\r\nwhether their concurrence was necessary or not. To this demand Prince\r\nGortschakoff offered the most strenuous resistance, claiming for Russia the\r\nliberty of accepting, or not accepting, the discussion of any question that\r\nmight be raised. It would clearly have been in the power of the Russian\r\nGovernment, had this condition been granted, to exclude from the\r\nconsideration of Europe precisely those matters which in the opinion of\r\nother States were most essentially of European import. Phrases of\r\nconciliation were suggested; but no ingenuity of language could shade over\r\nthe difference of purpose which separated the rival Powers. Every day the\r\nchances of the meeting of the Congress seemed to be diminishing, the\r\napproach of war between Russia and Great Britain more unmistakable. Lord\r\nBeaconsfield called out the Reserves and summoned troops from India; even\r\nthe project of seizing a port in Asia Minor in case the Sultan should fall\r\nunder Russian influence was discussed in the Cabinet. Unable to reconcile\r\nhimself to these vigorous measures, Lord Derby, who had long been at\r\nvariance with the Premier, now finally withdrew from the Cabinet (March\r\n28). He was succeeded in his office by the Marquis of Salisbury, whose\r\ncomparison of his relative and predecessor to Titus Oates revived the\r\ninterest of the diplomatic world in a now forgotten period of English\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n[Circular of April 1.]\r\n\r\nThe new Foreign Secretary had not been many days in office when a Circular,\r\ndespatched to all the Foreign Courts, summed up the objections of Great\r\nBritain to the Treaty of San Stefano. It was pointed out that a strong\r\nSlavic State would be created under the control of Russia, possessing\r\nimportant harbours upon the shores of the Black Sea and the Archipelago,\r\nand giving to Russia a preponderating influence over political and\r\ncommercial relations on both those seas; that a large Greek population\r\nwould be merged in a dominant Slavic majority; that by the extension of\r\nBulgaria to the Archipelago the Albanian and Greek provinces left to the\r\nSultan would be severed from Constantinople; that the annexation of\r\nBessarabia and of Batoum would make the will of the Russian Government\r\ndominant over all the vicinity of the Black Sea; that the acquisition of\r\nthe strongholds of Armenia would place the population of that province\r\nunder the immediate influence of the Power that held these strongholds,\r\nwhile through the cession of Bayazid the European trade from Trebizond to\r\nPersia would become liable to be arrested by the prohibitory barriers of\r\nthe Russian commercial system. Finally, by the stipulation for an indemnity\r\nwhich it was beyond the power of Turkey to discharge, and by the reference\r\nof the mode of payment or guarantee to a later settlement, Russia had\r\nplaced it in its power either to extort yet larger cessions of territory,\r\nor to force Turkey into engagements subordinating its policy in all things\r\nto that of St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\n[Count Schouvaloff.]\r\n\r\n[Secret agreement, May 30th.]\r\n\r\n[Convention with Turkey, June 4.]\r\n\r\n[Cyprus.]\r\n\r\nIt was the object of Lord Salisbury to show that the effects of the Treaty\r\nof San Stefano, taken in a mass, threatened the peace and the interests of\r\nEurope, and therefore, whatever might be advanced for or against individual\r\nstipulations of the Treaty, that the Treaty as a whole, and not clauses\r\nselected by one Power, must be submitted to the Congress if the examination\r\nwas not to prove illusory. This was a just line of argument. Nevertheless\r\nit was natural to suppose that some parts of the Treaty must be more\r\ndistasteful than others to Great Britain; and Count Schouvaloff, who was\r\nsincerely desirous of peace, applied himself to the task of discovering\r\nwith what concessions Lord Beaconsfield's Cabinet would be satisfied. He\r\nfound that if Russia would consent to modifications of the Treaty in\r\nCongress excluding Bulgaria from the Ægæan Sea, reducing its area on the\r\nsouth and west, dividing it into two provinces, and restoring the Balkans\r\nto the Sultan as a military frontier, giving back Bayazid to the Turks, and\r\ngranting to other Powers besides Russia a voice in the organisation of\r\nEpirus, Thessaly, and the other Christian provinces of the Porte, England\r\nmight be induced to accept without essential change the other provisions of\r\nSan Stefano. On the 7th of May Count Schouvaloff quitted London for St.\r\nPetersburg, in order to lay before the Czar the results of his\r\ncommunications with the Cabinet, and to acquaint him with the state of\r\npublic opinion in England. On his journey hung the issues of peace or war.\r\nBacked by the counsels of the German Emperor, Schouvaloff succeeded in his\r\nmission. The Czar determined not to risk the great results already secured\r\nby insisting on the points contested, and Schouvaloff returned to London\r\nauthorised to conclude a pact with the British Government on the general\r\nbasis which had been laid down. On the 30th of May a secret agreement, in\r\nwhich the above were the principal points, was signed, and the meeting of\r\nthe Congress for the examination of the entire Treaty of San Stefano was\r\nnow assured. But it was not without the deepest anxiety and regret that\r\nLord Beaconsfield consented to the annexation of Batoum and the Armenian\r\nfortresses. He obtained indeed an assurance in the secret agreement with\r\nSchouvaloff that the Russian frontier should be no more extended on the\r\nside of Turkey in Asia; but his policy did not stop short here. By a\r\nConvention made with the Sultan on the 4th of June, Great Britain engaged,\r\nin the event of any further aggression by Russia upon the Asiatic\r\nterritories of the Sultan, to defend these territories by force of arms.\r\nThe Sultan in return promised to introduce the necessary reforms, to be\r\nagreed upon by the two Powers, for the protection of the Christian and\r\nother subjects of the Porte in these territories, and further assigned the\r\nIsland of Cyprus to be occupied and administered by England. It was\r\nstipulated by a humorous after-clause that if Russia should restore to\r\nTurkey its Armenian conquests, Cyprus would be evacuated by England, and\r\nthe Convention itself should be at an end. [555]\r\n\r\n[Congress of Berlin, June 13-July 13.]\r\n\r\n[Treaty of Berlin, July 13.]\r\n\r\nThe Congress of Berlin, at which the Premier himself and Lord Salisbury\r\nrepresented Great Britain, opened on the 13th of June. Though the\r\ncompromise between England and Russia had been settled in general terms,\r\nthe arrangement of details opened such a series of difficulties that the\r\nCongress seemed more than once on the point of breaking up. It was mainly\r\ndue to the perseverance and wisdom of Prince Bismarck, who transferred the\r\ndiscussion of the most crucial points from the Congress to private meetings\r\nof his guests, and who himself acted as conciliator when Gortschakoff\r\nfolded up his maps or Lord Beaconsfield ordered a special train, that the\r\nwork was at length achieved. The Treaty of Berlin, signed on the 13th of\r\nJuly, confined Bulgaria, as an autonomous Principality, to the country\r\nnorth of the Balkans, and diminished the authority which, pending the\r\nestablishment of its definitive system of government, would by the Treaty\r\nof San Stefano have belonged to a Russian commissioner. The portion of\r\nBulgaria south of the Balkans, but extending no farther west than the\r\nvalley of the Maritza, and no farther south than Mount Rhodope, was formed\r\ninto a Province of East Roumelia, to remain subject to the direct political\r\nand military authority of the Sultan, under conditions of administrative\r\nautonomy. The Sultan was declared to possess the right of erecting\r\nfortifications both on the coast and on the land-frontier of this province,\r\nand of maintaining troops there. Alike in Bulgaria and in Eastern Roumelia\r\nthe period of occupation by Russian troops was limited to nine months.\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina were handed over to Austria, to be occupied and\r\nadministered by that Power. The cessions of territory made to Servia and\r\nMontenegro in the Treaty of San Stefano were modified with the object of\r\ninterposing a broader strip between these two States; Bayazid was omitted\r\nfrom the ceded districts in Asia, and the Czar declared it his intention to\r\nerect Batoum into a free port, essentially commercial. At the instance of\r\nFrance the provisions relating to the Greek Provinces of Turkey were\r\nsuperseded by a vote in favour of the cession of part of these Provinces to\r\nthe Hellenic Kingdom. The Sultan was recommended to cede Thessaly and part\r\nof Epirus to Greece, the Powers reserving to themselves the right of\r\noffering their mediation to facilitate the negotiations. In other respects\r\nthe provisions of the Treaty of San Stefano were confirmed without\r\nsubstantial change.\r\n\r\n[Comparison of the two Treaties.]\r\n\r\nLord Beaconsfield returned to London, bringing, as he said, peace with\r\nhonour. It was claimed, in the despatch to our Ambassadors which\r\naccompanied the publication of the Treaty of Berlin, that in this Treaty\r\nthe cardinal objections raised by the British Government to the Treaty of\r\nSan Stefano had found an entire remedy. \"Bulgaria,\" wrote Lord Salisbury,\r\n\"is now confined to the river-barrier of the Danube, and consequently has\r\nnot only ceased to possess any harbour on the Archipelago, but is removed\r\nby more than a hundred miles from the neighbourhood of that sea. On the\r\nEuxine the important port of Bourgas has been restored to the Government of\r\nTurkey; and Bulgaria retains less than half the sea-board originally\r\nassigned to it, and possesses no other port except the roadstead of Varna,\r\nwhich can hardly be used for any but commercial purposes. The replacement\r\nunder Turkish rule of Bourgas and the southern half of the sea-board on the\r\nEuxine, and the strictly commercial character assigned to Batoum, have\r\nlargely obviated the menace to the liberty of the Black Sea. The political\r\noutposts of Russian power have been pushed back to the region beyond the\r\nBalkans; the Sultan's dominions have been provided with a defensible\r\nfrontier.\" It was in short the contention of the English Government that\r\nwhile Russia, in the pretended emancipation of a great part of European\r\nTurkey by the Treaty of San Stefano, had but acquired a new dependency,\r\nEngland, by insisting on the division of Bulgaria, had baffled this plan\r\nand restored to Turkey an effective military dominion over all the country\r\nsouth of the Balkans. That Lord Beaconsfield did well in severing Macedonia\r\nfrom the Slavic State of Bulgaria there is little reason to doubt; that,\r\nhaving so severed it, he did ill in leaving it without a European guarantee\r\nfor good government, every successive year made more plain; the wisdom of\r\nhis treatment of Bulgaria itself must, in the light of subsequent events,\r\nremain matter for controversy. It may fairly be said that in dealing with\r\nBulgaria English statesmen were, on the whole, dealing with the unknown.\r\nNevertheless, had guidance been accepted from the history of the other\r\nBalkan States, analogies were not altogether wanting or altogether remote.\r\nDuring the present century three Christian States had been formed out of\r\nwhat had been Ottoman territory: Servia, Greece, and Roumania. Not one of\r\nthese had become a Russian Province, or had failed to develop and maintain\r\na distinct national existence. In Servia an attempt had been made to retain\r\nfor the Porte the right of keeping troops in garrison. This attempt had\r\nproved a mistake. So long as the right was exercised it had simply been a\r\nsource of danger and disquiet, and it had finally been abandoned by the\r\nPorte itself. In the case of Greece, Russia, with a view to its own\r\ninterests, had originally proposed that the country should be divided into\r\nfour autonomous provinces tributary to the Sultan: against this the Greeks\r\nhad protested, and Canning had successfully supported their protest. Even\r\nthe appointment of an ex-Minister of St. Petersburg, Capodistrias, as first\r\nPresident of Greece in 1827 had failed to bring the liberated country under\r\nRussian influence; and in the course of the half-century which had since\r\nelapsed it had become one of the commonplaces of politics, accepted by\r\nevery school in every country of Western Europe, that the Powers had\r\ncommitted a great error in 1833 in not extending to far larger dimensions\r\nthe Greek Kingdom which they then established. In the case of Roumania, the\r\nBritish Government had, out of fear of Russia, insisted in 1856 that the\r\nprovinces of Moldavia and Wallachia should remain separate: the result was\r\nthat the inhabitants in defiance of England effected their union, and that\r\nafter a few years had passed there was not a single politician in England\r\nwho regarded their union otherwise than with satisfaction. If history\r\ntaught anything in the solution of the Eastern question, it taught that the\r\neffort to reserve for the Sultan a military existence in countries which\r\nhad passed from under his general control was futile, and that the best\r\nbarrier against Russian influence was to be found not in the division but\r\nin the strengthening and consolidation of the States rescued from Ottoman\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\nIt was of course open to English statesmen in 1878 to believe that all that\r\nhad hitherto passed in the Balkan Peninsula had no bearing upon the\r\nproblems of the hour, and that, whatever might have been the case with\r\nGreece, Servia, and Roumania, Bulgaria stood on a completely different\r\nfooting, and called for the application of principles not based on the\r\nexperience of the past but on the divinations of superior minds. Should the\r\nhistory of succeeding years bear out this view, should the Balkans become a\r\ntrue military frontier for Turkey, should Northern Bulgaria sink to the\r\ncondition of a Russian dependency, and Eastern Roumelia, in severance from\r\nits enslaved kin, abandon itself to a thriving ease behind the garrisons of\r\nthe reforming Ottoman, Lord Beaconsfield will have deserved the fame of a\r\nstatesman whose intuitions, undimmed by the mists of experience, penetrated\r\nthe secret of the future, and shaped, because they discerned, the destiny\r\nof nations. It will be the task of later historians to measure the exact\r\nperiod after the Congress of Berlin at which the process indicated by Lord\r\nBeaconsfield came into visible operation; it is the misfortune of those\r\nwhose view is limited by a single decade to have to record that in every\r\nparticular, with the single exception of the severance of Macedonia from\r\nthe Slavonic Principality, Lord Beaconsfield's ideas, purposes and\r\nanticipations, in so far as they related to Eastern Europe, have hitherto\r\nbeen contradicted by events. What happened in Greece, Servia, and Roumania\r\nhas happened in Bulgaria. Experience, thrown to the winds by English\r\nMinisters in 1878, has justified those who listened to its voice. There\r\nexists no such thing as a Turkish fortress on the Balkans; Bourgas no more\r\nbelongs to the Sultan than Athens or Belgrade; no Turkish soldier has been\r\nable to set foot within the territory whose very name, Eastern Roumelia,\r\nwas to stamp it as Turkish dominion. National independence, a living force\r\nin Greece, in Servia, in Roumania, has proved its power in Bulgaria too.\r\nThe efforts of Russia to establish its influence over a people liberated by\r\nits arms have been repelled with unexpected firmness. Like the divided\r\nmembers of Roumania, the divided members of Bulgaria have effected their\r\nunion. In this union, in the growing material and moral force of the\r\nBulgarian State, Western Europe sees a power wholly favourable to its own\r\nhopes for the future of the East, wholly adverse to the extension of\r\nRussian rule: and it has been reserved for Lord Beaconsfield's colleague at\r\nthe Congress of Berlin, regardless of the fact that Bulgaria north of the\r\nBalkans, not the southern Province, created that vigorous military and\r\npolitical organisation which was the precursor of national union, to\r\nexplain that in dividing Bulgaria into two portions the English Ministers\r\nof 1878 intended to promote its ultimate unity, and that in subjecting the\r\nsouthern half to the Sultan's rule they laid the foundation for its\r\nultimate independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Chapters I. to XI. of this Edition.\r\n\r\n[2] Chapters XII. to XVIII. of this Edition.\r\n\r\n[3] Page 362 of this Edition.\r\n\r\n[4] Ranke, Ursprung und Beginn der Revolutionskriege, p. 90.

Murray, our military attaché with Brunswick's army (in\r\nRecords: Flanders, vol. 221) are instructive: \"The conduct of the army\r\nunder the Princes of France is universally reprobated. Their appearance in\r\ndress, in attendants, in preparations, is ridiculous. As an instance,\r\nhowever trivial, it may be mentioned that on one of the waggons was written\r\n_Toilette de Monsieur_. The spirit of vengeance, however, which they\r\ndiscover on every occasion is far more serious. Wherever they have passed,\r\nthey have exercised acts of cruelty, in banishing and severely punishing\r\nthose persons who, though probably culpable, had yet been left untouched by\r\nthe Prussian commanders. To such an extent has this been carried that the\r\ncommander at Verdun would not suffer any Frenchman (emigrant) to pass a\r\nnight in the town without a special permission.\" Sept. 21. After the\r\nfailure of the campaign, Elgin writes of the emigrants: \"They everywhere\r\nadded to the cruelties for some of which several hussars had been executed:\r\ncarried to its extent the vengeance threatened in the Duke of Brunswick's\r\nDeclaration, in burning whole villages where a shot was fired on them: and\r\non the other hand by their self-sufficiency, want of subordination and\r\npersonal disrespect, have drawn upon themselves the contempt of the\r\ncombined armies.\" Oct. 6. So late as 1796, the exile Louis XVIII. declared\r\nhis intention to restore the \"property and rights\" (i.e. tithes, feudal\r\ndues, etc.) of the nobles and clergy, and to punish the men who had\r\n\"committed offences.\" See Letter to Pichegru, May 4, 1796, in Manuscrit\r\nInédit de Louis XVIII., p. 464.\r\n\r\n[19] Wordsworth, Prelude, book ix.\r\n\r\n[20] The correspondence is in Ranke, Ursprung und Beginn, p. 371. Such was\r\nthe famine in the Prussian camp that Dumouriez sent the King of Prussia\r\ntwelve loaves, twelve pounds of coffee, and twelve pounds of sugar.

The roads are covered with emigrants,\r\nand persons of these provinces flying from the French armies,\" Records:\r\nFlanders, vol. 222.\r\n\r\n[24] In Nov. 1792, Grenville ordered the English envoys at Vienna and\r\nBerlin to discover, if possible, the real designs of aggrandisement held by\r\nthose Courts. Mr. Straton, at Vienna, got wind of the agreement against\r\nPoland. \"I requested Count Philip Cobenzl\" (the Austrian Minister) \"that he\r\nwould have the goodness to open himself confidentially to me on the precise\r\nobject which the two allied Courts might have in contemplation. This,\r\nhowever, the Count was by no means disposed to do; on the contrary, he went\r\nround the compass of evasion in order to avoid a direct answer. But\r\ndetermined as I was to push the Austrian Minister, I heaped question on\r\nquestion, until I forced him to say, blushing, and with evident signs of\r\nembarrassment, 'Count Stadion' (Ambassador at London) 'will be able to\r\nsatisfy the curiosity of the British Minister, to whatever point it may be\r\ndirected.'\" Jan. 20, 1793. Records: Austria, vol. 32. Stadion accordingly\r\ninformed Lord Grenville of the Polish and Bavarian plans. Grenville\r\nexpressed his concern and regret at the aggression on Poland, and gave\r\nreasons against the Bavarian exchange. To our envoy with the King of\r\nPrussia Grenville wrote: \"It may possibly be the intention of the Courts to\r\nadopt a plan of indemnifying themselves for the expense of the war by fresh\r\nacquisitions in Poland, and carrying into execution a new partition of that\r\ncountry. You will not fail to explain in the most distinct and pointed\r\nmanner his Majesty's entire disapprobation of such a plan, and his\r\ndetermination on no account to concur in any measures which may tend to the\r\ncompletion of a design so unjust in itself.\" Jan. 4, 1793. Records: Army in\r\nGermany, vol. 437. At Vienna Cobenzl declared, Feb. 9, that Austria could\r\nnot now \"even manifest a wish to oppose the projects of Prussia in Poland,\r\nas in that case his Prussian Majesty would probably withdraw his assistance\r\nfrom the French war; nay, perhaps even enter into an alliance with that\r\nnation and invade Bohemia.\" Records: Austria, vol. 32.\r\n\r\n[25] Auckland, ii. 464.

Grenville to\r\nEden, Sept. 7th, 1793, Records: Austria, vol. 34: a most important\r\nhistorical document, setting out the principles of alliance between England\r\nand Austria. Austria, if it will abandon the Bavarian exchange, may claim\r\nannexations on the border of the Netherlands, in Alsace and Lorraine, and\r\nin the intermediate parts of the frontier of France. England's indemnity\r\n\"must be looked for in the foreign settlements and colonies of France....\r\nHis Majesty has an interest in seeing the House of Austria strengthen\r\nitself by acquisitions on the French frontier. The Emperor must see with\r\npleasure the relative increase of the naval and commercial resources of\r\nthis country beyond those of France.\" In the face of this paper, it cannot\r\nbe maintained that the war of 1793 was, after the first few months, purely\r\ndefensive on England's part; though no doubt Pitt's notion of an indemnity\r\nwas fair and modest in comparison with the schemes and acts of his enemy.\r\n\r\n[31] The first mention of Bonaparte's name in any British document\r\noccurs in an account of the army of Toulon sent to London in Dec. 1793\r\nby a spy. \"Les capitaines d'artillérie, élévé dans cet état, connoissent\r\nleur service et ont tous du talens. Ils préféroient l'employer pour une\r\nmeilleure cause.... Le sixtèrne, nommé Bonaparte, trés republicain, a\r\nété tué sous les murs de Toulon.\" Records: France, vol. 599. Austria\r\nundertook to send 5,000 troops from Lombardy to defend Toulon, but broke\r\nits engagement. \"You will wait on M. Thugut (the Austrian Minister) and\r\nclaim in the most peremptory terms the performance of this engagement.\r\nIt would be very offensive to his Majesty that a request made so\r\nrepeatedly on his part should be neglected; but it is infinitely more so\r\nto see that, when this country is straining every nerve for the common\r\ncause, a body of troops for the want of which Toulon may possibly at\r\nthis moment be lost, have remained inactive at Milan. You will admit of\r\nno further excuses.\" Grenville to Eden, Nov. 24, 1793. Thugut's written\r\nanswer was, \"The Emperor gave the order of march at a moment when the\r\ntown of Toulon had no garrison. Its preservation then seemed matter of\r\npressing necessity, but now all inquietude on this score has happily\r\ndisappeared. The troops of different nations already assembled at Toulon\r\nput the place out of all danger.\" Records: Austria, vol. 35.\r\n\r\n[32] Häusser, i. 482. \"La Prusse,\" wrote Thugut at this time, \"parviendra\r\nau moyen de son alliance à nous faire plus de mal qu'elle ne nous a fait\r\npar les guerres les plus sanglantes.\" Briefe, i. 12, 15. Thugut even\r\nproposed that England should encourage the Poles to resist. Eden, April\r\n15; Records: Austria, vol. 33.\r\n\r\n[33] The English Government found that Thugut was from the first\r\nindifferent to their own aim, the restoration of the Bourbons, or\r\nestablishment of some orderly government in France. In so far as he\r\nconcerned himself with the internal affairs of France, he hoped rather for\r\ncontinued dissension, as facilitating the annexation of French territory by\r\nAustria. \"Qu'on profite de ce conflit des partis en France pour tâcher de\r\nse rendre mâitre des forteresses, afin de faire la loi au parti qui aura\r\nprévalu, et l'obliger d'acheter la paix et la protection de l'empereur, en\r\nlui cedant telle partie de ses conquêtes que S.M. jugera de sa covenance.\"\r\nBriefe, i. 13.\r\n\r\n[34] The despatches of Lord Yarmouth from the Prussian and Austrian\r\nheadquarters, from July 17 to Nov. 22, 1793, give a lively picture both of\r\nthe military operations and of the political intrigues of this period. They\r\nare accompanied by the MS. journal of the Austrian army from Sept. 15 to\r\nDec. 14, each copy apparently with Wurmser's autograph, and by the original\r\nletter of the Prussian Minister, Lucchesini, to Lord Yarmouth, announcing\r\nthe withdrawal of Prussia from the war, \"M. de Lucchesini read it to me\r\nvery hastily, and seemed almost ashamed of a part of its contents.\"\r\nRecords: Army in Germany, vols. 437, 438, 439.\r\n\r\n[35] Hardenberg (Ranke), i. 181, Vivenot, Herzog Albrecht, i. 10.\r\n\r\n[36] Elgin reports after this engagement, May 1st, 1794--\"The French army\r\nappears to continue much what it has hitherto been, vigorous and\r\npersevering where (as in villages and woods) the local advantages are of a\r\nnature to supply the defects of military science; weak and helpless beyond\r\nbelief where cavalry can act, and manoeuvres are possible.... The magazines\r\nof the army are stored, and the provisions regularly given out to the\r\ntroops, and good in quality. Indeed, it is singular to observe in all the\r\nvillages where we have been forward forage, etc., in plenty, and all the\r\ncountry cultivated as usual. The inhabitants, however, have retired with\r\nthe French army; and to that degree that the tract we have lately taken\r\npossession of is absolutely deserted.... The execution of Danton has\r\nproduced no greater effect in the army than other executions, and we have\r\nfound many papers on those who fell in the late actions treating it with\r\nridicule, and as a source of joy.\" Records: Flanders, 226. \"I am in hopes\r\nto hear from you on the subject of the French prisoners, as to where I am\r\nto apply for the money I advance for their subsistence. They are a great\r\nnumber of them almost naked, some entirely so. It is absolutely shocking to\r\nhumanity to see them. I would purchase some coarse clothing for those that\r\nare in the worst state, but know not how far I should be authorised. They\r\nare mostly old men and boys.\" Consul Harward, at Ostend, March 4th,\r\n_id_.\r\n\r\n[37] These events are the subject of controversy. See Hüffer, Oestreich und\r\nPreussen, p. 62 Von Sybel, iii. 138. Vivenot, Clerfayt, p. 38. The old\r\nbelief, defended by Von Sybel, was that Thugut himself had determined upon\r\nthe evacuation of Belgium, and treacherously deprived Coburg of forces for\r\nits defence. But, apart from other evidence, the tone of exasperation that\r\nruns through Thugut's private letters is irreconcilable with this theory.\r\nLord Elgin, whose reports are used by Von Sybel, no doubt believed that\r\nThugut was playing false; but he was a bad judge, being in the hands of\r\nThugut's opponents, especially General Mack, whom he glorifies in the most\r\nabsurd way. The other English envoy in Belgium, Lord Yarmouth, reported in\r\nfavour of Thugut's good faith in this matter, and against military\r\nintriguers. Records: Army in Germany, vol. 440. A letter of Prince\r\nWaldeck's in Thugut, i. 387, and a conversation between Mack and Sir Morton\r\nEden, on Feb. 3rd, 1797, reported by the latter in Records: Austria, vol.\r\n48, appear to fix the responsibility for the evacuation of Belgium on these\r\ntwo generals, Waldeck and Mack, and on the Emperor's confidential military\r\nadviser, Rollin.\r\n\r\n[38] \"Should the French come they will find this town perfectly empty.\r\nExcept my own, I do not think there are three houses in Ostend with a bed\r\nin them. So general a panic I never witnessed.\" June 30th.--\"To remain here\r\nalone would be a wanton sacrifice. God knows 'tis an awful stroke to me to\r\nleave a place just as I began to be comfortably settled.\" Consul Harward:\r\nRecords: Army in Germany, vol. 440. \"All the English are arrested in\r\nOstend; the men are confined in the Capuchin convent, and the women in the\r\nConvent des Soeurs Blancs. All the Flamands from the age of 17 to 32 are\r\nforced to go for soldiers. At Bruges the French issued an order for 800 men\r\nto present themselves. Thirty only came, in consequence of which they rang\r\na bell on the Grand Place, and the inhabitants thinking that it was some\r\nordinance, quitted their houses to hear it, when they were surrounded by\r\nthe French soldiers, and upwards of 1,000 men secured, gentle and simple,\r\nwho were all immediately set to work on the canals.\" Mr. W.

Strongly as I have spoken in my despatch of the\r\npresent state of France, I have said much less than my information, drawn\r\nfrom various quarters, and applying to almost every part of France, would\r\nfairly warrant. We can never hope that the circumstances, as far as they\r\nregard the state of France, can be more favourable than they now are. For\r\nGod's sake enforce these points with all the earnestness which I am sure\r\nyou will feel upon them.\" Grenville to Eden, April 17, 1795; Records:\r\nAustria, vol. 41. After the failure of the expedition, the British\r\nGovernment made the grave charge against Thugut that while he was\r\nofficially sending Clerfayt pressing orders to advance, he secretly told\r\nhim to do nothing. \"It is in vain to reason with the Austrian Ministers on\r\nthe folly and ill faith of a system which they have been under the\r\nnecessity of concealing from you, and which they will probably endeavour to\r\ndisguise\" Grenville to Eden, Oct., 1795; _id_., vol. 43. This charge,\r\nrepeated by historians, is disproved by Thugut's private letters. Briefe,\r\ni. 221, _seq_. No one more bitterly resented Clerfayt's inaction.\r\n\r\n[43] The documents relating to the expedition to Quiberon, with several\r\nletters of D'Artois, Charette, and the Vendean leaders, are in Records:\r\nFrance, vol. 600.\r\n\r\n[44] Von Sybel, iii. 537.

He adds, \"The\r\nSamnites and the Lucanians could not have shown so horrible a spectacle,\r\nbecause they had no feudal laws.\" Galanti's book gives perhaps the best\r\nidea of the immense task faced by monarchy in the eighteenth century in\r\nits struggle against what he justly calls \"gli orrori del governo\r\nfeudale.\" Nothing but a study of these details of actual life described by\r\neye-witnesses can convey an adequate impression of the completeness and the\r\nmisery of the feudal order in the more backward countries of Europe till\r\nfar down in the eighteenth century.

Despatches of Col.\r\nGraham, British attaché with the Austrian army, in Records: Italian States,\r\nvol. 57. These most interesting letters, which begin on May 19, show the\r\ndiscord and suspicion prevalent from the first in the Austrian army.\r\n\"Beaulieu has not met with cordial co-operation from his own generals,\r\nstill less from the Piedmontese. He accuses them of having chosen to be\r\nbeat in order to bring about a peace promised in January last.\" \"Beaulieu\r\nwas more violent than ever against his generals who have occasioned the\r\nfailure of his plans. He said nine of them were cowards. I believe some of\r\nthem are ill-affected to the cause.\" June 15.--\"Many of the officers\r\ncomfort themselves with thinking that defeat must force peace, and others\r\nexpress themselves in terms of despair.\" July 25,--Beaulieu told Graham\r\nthat if Bonaparte had pushed on after the battle of Lodi, he might have\r\ngone straight into Mantua. The preparations for defence were made later.\r\n\r\n[49] Thugut, Briefe i. 107. A correspondence on this subject was carried on\r\nin cypher between Thugut and Ludwig Cobenzl, Austrian Ambassador at St.\r\nPetersburg in 1793-4. During Thugut's absence in Belgium, June, 1794,\r\nCobenzl sent a duplicate despatch, not in cypher, to Vienna. Old Prince\r\nKaunitz, the ex-minister, heard that a courier had arrived from St\r\nPetersburg, and demanded the despatch at the Foreign Office \"like a\r\ndictator.\" It was given to him. \"Ainsi,\" says Thugut, \"adieu au secret qui\r\ndepuis un an a été conservé avec tant de soins!\"\r\n\r\n[50] Wurmser's reports are in Vivenot, Clerfayt, p. 477. Graham's daily\r\ndespatches from the Austrian head-quarters give a vivid picture of these\r\noperations, and of the sudden change from exultation to despair. Aug.\r\n1.--\"I have the honour to inform your lordship that the siege of Mantua is\r\nraised, the French having retreated last night with the utmost\r\nprecipitation.\" Aug. 2.--\"The Austrians are in possession of all the French\r\nmortars and cannon, amounting to about 140, with 190,000 shells and bombs;\r\nthe loss of the Imperial army is inconsiderable.\" Aug. 5.--\"The rout of\r\nthis day has sadly changed the state of affairs. There are no accounts of\r\nGeneral Quosdanovich.\" Aug. 9.--\"Our loss in men and cannon was much\r\ngreater than was imagined. I had no idea of the possibility of the extent\r\nof such misfortunes as have overwhelmed us\" Aug. 17.--\"It is scarcely\r\npossible to describe the state of disorder and discouragement that prevails\r\nin the army. Were I free from apprehension, about the fate of my letter\"\r\n(he had lost his baggage and his cypher in it), \"I should despair of\r\nfinding language adequate to convey a just idea of the discontent of the\r\nofficers with General Wurmser. From generals to subalterns the universal\r\nlanguage is 'qu'il faut faire la paix, car nous ne savons pas faire la\r\nguerre.'\" Aug. 18.--\"Not only the commander-in-chief, but the greatest\r\nnumber of the generals are objects of contempt and ridicule.\" Aug. 27.--\"I\r\ndo not exaggerate when I say that I have met with instances of down-right\r\ndotage.\" \"It was in general orders that wine should be distributed to the\r\nmen previous to the attack of the 29th. There was some difficulty in\r\ngetting it up to Monte Baldo. General Bayolitzy observed that 'it did not\r\nsignify, for the men might get the value in money afterwards.' The men\r\nmarched at six in the evening without it, to attack at daybreak, and\r\nreceived four kreutzers afterwards. This is a fact I can attest. In action\r\nI saw officers sent on urgent messages going at a foot's pace: they say\r\nthat their horses are half starved, and that they cannot afford to kill\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n[51] Grundsätze (Archduke Charles), ii. 202. Bulletins in Wiener Zeitung,\r\nJune-Oct., 1796.\r\n\r\n[52] Martens, vi. 59.\r\n\r\n[53] This seems to me to be the probable truth about Austria's policy in\r\n1796, of which opposite views will be found in Häusser, vol. ii. ch. 1-3,\r\nand in Hüffer, Oestreich und Preussen, p. 142. Thugut professed in 1793 to\r\nhave given up the project of the Bavarian exchange in deference to England.\r\nHe admitted, however, soon afterwards, that he had again been pressing the\r\nKing of Prussia to consent to it, but said that this was a ruse, intended\r\nto make Prussia consent to Austria's annexing a large piece of France\r\ninstead. Eden, Sept., 1793; Records: Austria, vol. 34. The incident shows\r\nthe difficulty of getting at the truth in diplomacy.\r\n\r\n[54] Yet the Government had had warning of this in a series of striking\r\nreports sent by one of Lord Elgin's spies during the Reign of Terror.\r\n\"Jamais la France ne fut cultivée comme elle l'est. Il n'y a pas un arpent\r\nqui ne soit ensemencé, sauf dans les lieux où opèrent les armées\r\nbelligérantes. Cette culture universelle a été forcée par les Directrices là\r\noù on ne la faisait pas volontairement.\" June 8, 1794; Records: Flanders,\r\nvol. 226. Elgin had established a line of spies from Paris to the Belgian\r\nfrontier. Every one of these persons was arrested by the Revolutionary\r\nauthorities. Elgin then fell in with the writer of the above, whose name is\r\nconcealed, and placed him on the Swiss frontier. He was evidently a person\r\nthoroughly familiar with both civil and military administration. He appears\r\nto have talked to every Frenchman who entered Switzerland; and his reports\r\ncontain far the best information that readied England during the Reign of\r\nTerror, contradicting the Royalists, who said that the war was only kept up\r\nby terrorism. He warned the English Government that the French nation in a\r\nmass was on the side of the Revolution, and declared that the downfall of\r\nRobespierre and the terrorists would make no difference in the prosecution\r\nof the war. The Government seems to have paid no attention to his reports,\r\nif indeed they were ever read.\r\n\r\n[55] Correspondance de Napoleon, ii. 28. Thugut, about this time, formed\r\nthe plan of annexing Bologna and Ferrara to Austria, and said that if this\r\nresult could be achieved, the French attack upon the Papal States would be\r\nno bad matter. See the instructions to Allvintzy, in Vivenot, Clerfayt, p.\r\n511, which also contain the first Austrian orders to imprison Italian\r\ninnovators, the beginning of Austria's later Italian policy.\r\n\r\n[56] Wurmser had orders to break out southwards into the Papal States.\r\n\"These orders he (Thugut) knew had reached the Marshal, but they were also\r\nknown to the enemy, as a cadet of Strasoldo's regiment, who was carrying\r\nthe duplicate, had been taken prisoner, and having been seen to swallow a\r\nball of wax, in which the order was wrapped up, he was immediately put to\r\ndeath and the paper taken out of his stomach.\" Eden, Jan., 1797; Records:\r\nAustria, vol. 48. Colonel Graham, who had been shut up in Mantua since\r\nSept. 10, escaped on Dec 17, and restored communication between Wurmser and\r\nAllvintzy. He was present at the battle of Rivoli, which is described in\r\nhis despatches.\r\n\r\n[57] \"We expect every hour to hear of the entry of the Neapolitan troops\r\nand the declaration of a religious war. Every preparation has been made for\r\nsuch an event.\" Graves to Lord Grenville, Oct. 1, 1796; Records; Rome, vol.\r\n56.\r\n\r\n[58] \"The clamours for peace have become loud and importunate. His Imperial\r\nMajesty is constantly assailed by all his Ministers, M. de Thugut alone\r\nexcepted, and by all who approach his person. Attempts are even made to\r\nalarm him with a dread of insurrection. In the midst of these calamities M.\r\nde Thugut retains his firmness of mind, and continues to struggle against\r\nthe united voice of the nobility and the numerous and trying adversities\r\nthat press upon him.\" Eden, April 1. \"The confusion at the army exceeds the\r\nbounds of belief. Had Bonaparte continued his progress hither (Vienna), no\r\ndoubt is entertained that he might have entered the place without\r\nopposition. That, instead of risking this enterprise, he should have\r\nstopped and given the Austrians six days to recover from their alarm and to\r\nprepare for defence, is a circumstance which it is impossible to account\r\nfor.\" April 12. \"He\" (Mack) \"said that when this place was threatened by\r\nthe enemy, Her Imperial Majesty broke in upon the Emperor while in\r\nconference with his Minister, and, throwing herself and her children at his\r\nfeet, determined His Majesty to open the negotiation which terminated in\r\nthe shameful desertion of his ally.\" Aug. 16; Records: Austria, vols. 49,\r\n50. Thugut subsequently told Lord Minto that if he could have laid his hand\r\nupon £500,000 in cash to stop the run on the Bank of Vienna, the war would\r\nhave been continued, in which case he believed he would have surrounded\r\nBonaparte's army.\r\n\r\n[59] The cession of the Rhenish Provinces was not, as usually stated,\r\ncontained in the Preliminaries.

These letters\r\nbreathe a fire and passion rare among German statesmen of that day, and\r\nshow the fine side of Thugut's character. The well-known story of the\r\ndestruction of Cobenzl's vase by Bonaparte at the last sitting, with the\r\nwords, \"Thus will I dash the Austrian Monarchy to pieces,\" is mythical.\r\nCobenzl's own account of the scene is as follows;--\"Bonaparte, excited by\r\nnot having slept for two nights, emptied glass after glass of punch. When I\r\nexplained with the greatest composure, Bonaparte started up in a violent\r\nrage, and poured out a flood of abuse, at the same time scratching his name\r\nillegibly at the foot of the statement which he had handed in as protocol.\r\nThen without waiting for our signatures, he put on his hat in the\r\nconference-room itself, and left us. Until he was in the street he\r\ncontinued to vociferate in a manner that could only be ascribed to\r\nintoxication, though Clarke and the rest of his suite, who were waiting in\r\nthe hall, did their best to restrain him.\" \"He behaved as if he had escaped\r\nfrom a lunatic asylum.

Mack had been a famous character since the campaign of 1793.\r\nElgin's letters to Lord Grenville from the Netherlands, private as well as\r\npublic, are full of extravagant praise of him. In July, 1796, Graham writes\r\nfrom the Italian army: \"In the opinion of all here, the greatest general in\r\nEurope is the Quartermaster Mack, who was in England in 1793. Would to God\r\nhe was marching, and here now.\" Mack, on the other hand, did not grudge\r\nflattery to the English:--\"Je perdrais partout espoir et patience si je\r\nn'avais pas vu pour mon bonheur et ma consolation l'adorable Triumvirat\"\r\n(Pitt, Grenville, Dundas) \"qui surveille à Londres nos affaires. Soyez, mon\r\ncher ami, l'organe de ma profonde vénération envers ces Ministres\r\nincomparables.\" Mack to Elgin, 23. Feb., 1794. The British Government was\r\nconstantly pressing Thugut to make Mack commander-in chief.

However, the\r\nsecret was so well kept that we contrived to get their Majesties' treasure\r\nin jewels and money, to a very considerable extent, on board of H.M. ship\r\nthe _Vanguard_ the 20th of December, and Lord Nelson went on the next\r\nnight by a secret passage into the Palace, and brought off in his boats\r\ntheir Sicilian Majesties and all the Royal Family. It was not discovered at\r\nNaples, until very late at night, that the Royal Family had escaped.... On\r\nthe morning of Christmas Day, some hours before we got into Palermo, Prince\r\nAlbert, one of their Majesties' sons, six years of age, was, either from\r\nfright or fatigue, taken with violent convulsions, and died in the arms of\r\nLady Hamilton, the Queen, the Princesses, and women attendants being in\r\nsuch confusion as to be incapable of affording any assistance.\"\r\n\r\n[71] See Helfert, Der Rastatter Gesandtenmord, and Sybel's article thereon,\r\nin Hist.

According to Hamilton, some of the\r\nRepublicans in the forts had actually gone to their homes before Nelson\r\npronounced the capitulation void. \"When we anchored in the Bay, the 24th of\r\nJune, the capitulation of the castles had in some measure taken place.\r\nFourteen large polacks had taken on board out of the castles the most\r\nconspicuous and criminal of the Neapolitan rebels that had chosen to go to\r\nToulon; the others had already been permitted to return to their homes.\" If\r\nthis is so, Nelson's pretext that the capitulation had not been executed\r\nwas a mere afterthought. Helfert is mistaken in calling the letter or\r\nproclamation of July 8th repudiating the treaty, a forgery. It is perfectly\r\ngenuine. It was published by Nelson in the King's name, and is enclosed in\r\nHamilton's despatch. Hamilton's exultations about himself and his wife, and\r\ntheir share in these events, are sorry reading. \"In short, Lord Nelson and\r\nI, with Emma, have carried affairs to this happy crisis. Emma is really the\r\nQueen's bosom friend.... You may imagine, when we three agree, what real\r\nbusiness is done.... At least I shall end my diplomatical career\r\ngloriously, as you will see by what the King of Naples writes from this\r\nship to his Minister in London, owing the recovery of his kingdom to the\r\nKing's fleet, and Lord Nelson and me.\" (Aug. 4, _id_.)

Though they felt some regard for the rights of the King of Piedmont,\r\nPitt and Grenville were just as ready to hand over the Republic of Genoa to\r\nthe Hapsburgs as Bonaparte had been to hand over Venice; in fact, they\r\nlooked forward to the destruction of the Genoese State with avowed\r\npleasure, because it easily fell under the influence of France. Their\r\nprincipal anxiety was that if Austria \"should retain Venice and Genoa and\r\npossibly acquire Leghorn,\" it should grant England an advantageous\r\ncommercial treaty. Grenville to Minto, Feb. 8, 1800; Castlereagh, v. 3-11.\r\n\r\n[75] Lord Mulgrave to Grenville, Sept. 12, 1799; Records: Army of\r\nSwitzerland, vol. 80. \"Suvaroff opened himself to me in the most unreserved\r\nmanner. He began by stating that he had been called at a very advanced\r\nperiod of life from his retirement, where his ample fortune and honours\r\nplaced him beyond the allurement of any motives of interest. Attachment to\r\nhis sovereign and zeal for his God inspired him with the hope and the\r\nexpectation of conquests. He now found himself under very different\r\ncircumstances. He found himself surrounded by the parasites or spies of\r\nThugut, men at his devotion, creatures of his power: an army bigoted to a\r\ndefensive system, afraid even to pursue their successes when that system\r\nhad permitted them to obtain any; he had to encounter the further check of\r\na Government at Vienna averse to enterprise, etc.\"\r\n\r\n[76] Miliutin, 2, 20, 3, 186; Minto, Aug. 10, 1799; Records: Austria, vol.\r\n56. \"I had no sooner mentioned this topic (Piedmont) than I perceived I had\r\ntouched a very delicate point. M. de Thugut's manner changed instantly from\r\nthat of coolness and civility to a great show of warmth attended with some\r\nsharpness. He became immediately loud and animated, and expressed chagrin\r\nat the invitation sent to the King of Sardinia.... He considers the\r\nconquest of Piedmont as one made by Austria of an enemy's country. He\r\ndenies that the King of Sardinia can be considered as an ally or as a\r\nfriend, or even as a neuter; and, besides imputing a thousand instances of\r\nill-faith to that Court, relies on the actual alliance made by it with the\r\nFrench Republic by which the King of Sardinia had appropriated to himself\r\npart of the Emperor's dominions in Lombardy, an offence which, I perceive,\r\nwill not be easily forgotten.... I mention these circumstances to show the\r\ndegree of passion which the Court of Vienna mixes with this discussion.\"\r\nMinto answered Thugut's invective with the odd remark \"that perhaps in the\r\npresent extraordinary period the most rational object of this war was to\r\nrestore the integrity of the moral principle both in civil and political\r\nlife, and that this principle of justice should take the lead in his mind\r\nof those considerations of temporary convenience which in ordinary times\r\nmight not have escaped his notice.\" Thugut then said \"that the Emperor of\r\nRussia had desisted from his measure of the King of Sardinia's immediate\r\nrecall, leaving the time of that return to the Emperor.\" On the margin of\r\nthe despatch, against this sentence, is written in pencil, in Lord\r\nGrenville's handwriting, \"I am persuaded this is not true.\"\r\n\r\n[77] Miliutin, 3, 117. And so almost verbatim in a conversation described\r\nin Eden's despatch, Aug. 31 Records: Austria, vol. 55. \"M. de Thugut's\r\nanswer was evidently dictated by a suspicion rankling in his mind that the\r\nNetherlands might be made a means of aggrandisement for Prussia. His\r\njealousy and aversion to that Power are at this moment more inveterate than\r\nI have before seen them. It is probable that he may have some idea of\r\nestablishing there the Great Duke of Tuscany.\"\r\n\r\n[78] Thugut's territorial policy did actually make him propose to abolish\r\nthe Papacy not only as a temporal Power, but as a religious institution.\r\n\"Baron Thugut argued strongly on the possibility of doing without a Pope,\r\nand of each sovereign taking on himself the function of head of the\r\nNational Church, as in England. I said that as a Protestant, I could not be\r\nsupposed to think the authority of the Bishop of Rome necessary; but that\r\nin the present state of religious opinion, and considering the only\r\nalternative in those matters, viz. the subsistence of the Roman Catholic\r\nfaith or the extinction of Christianity itself, I preferred, though a\r\nProtestant, the Pope to the Goddess of Reason. However, the mind of Baron\r\nThugut is not open to any reasoning of a general nature when it is put in\r\ncompetition with conquest or acquisition of territory.\" Minto to Grenville,\r\nOct. 22, 1799; Records: Austria, vol. 57. The suspicions of Austria current\r\nat the Neapolitan Court are curiously shown in the Nelson Correspondence.\r\nNelson writes to Minto (Aug. 20) at Vienna: \"For the sake of the civilised\r\nworld, let us work together, and as the best act of our lives manage to\r\nhang Thugut ... As you are with Thugut, your penetrating mind will discover\r\nthe villain in all his actions.... That Thugut is caballing.... Pray keep\r\nan eye upon the rascal, and you will soon find what I say is true. Let us\r\nhang these three miscreants, and all will go smooth.\" Suvaroff was not more\r\ncomplimentary. \"How can that desk-worm, that night-owl, direct an army from\r\nhis dusky nest, even if he had the sword of Scanderbeg?\" (Sept. 3.)\r\n\r\n[79] Miliutin, iii. 37; Bentinck, Aug. 16, from the battle-field; Records:\r\nItalian States, vol. 58. His letter ends \"I must apologise to your Lordship\r\nfor the appearance of this despatch\" (it is on thin Italian paper and\r\nalmost illegible): \"we\" (_i.e._, Suvaroff's staff) \"have had the misfortune\r\nto have had our baggage plundered by the Cossacks.\"\r\n\r\n[80] Every capable soldier saw the ruinous mischief of the Archduke's\r\nwithdrawal. \"Not only are all prospects of our making any progress in\r\nSwitzerland at an end, but the chance of maintaining the position now\r\noccupied is extremely precarious. The jealousy and mistrust that exists\r\nbetween the Austrians and Russians is inconceivable. I shall not pretend to\r\noffer an opinion on what might be the most advantageous arrangement for the\r\narmy of Switzerland, but it is certain that none can be so bad as that\r\nwhich at present exists.\" Colonel Crauford, English military envoy, Sept.\r\n5, 1799; Records: Army of Switzerland, vol. 79. The subsequent Operations\r\nof Korsakoff are described in despatches of Colonel Ramsay and Lord\r\nMulgrave, _id_. vol. 80, 81, Conversations with the Archduke Charles\r\nin those of Mr. Wickham, _id_. vol. 77.\r\n\r\n[81] The despatches of Colonel Clinton, English attaché with Suvaroff, are\r\nin singular contrast to the highly-coloured accounts of this retreat common\r\nin histories. Of the most critical part he only says: \"On the 6th the army\r\npassed the Panix mountain, which the snow that had fallen during the last\r\nweek had rendered dangerous, and several horses and mules were lost on the\r\nmarch.\" He expresses the poorest opinion of Suvaroff and his officers: \"The\r\nMarshal is entirely worn out and incapable of any exertion: he will not\r\nsuffer the subject of the indiscipline of his army to be mentioned to him.\r\nHe is popular with his army because he puts no check whatever in its\r\nlicentiousness. His honesty is now his only remaining good quality.\"\r\nRecords: Army of Switzerland, vol. 80. The elaborate plan for Suvaroff's\r\nand Korsakoff's combined movements, made as if Switzerland had been an open\r\ncountry and Massena's army a flock of sheep, was constructed by the\r\nAustrian colonel Weyrother, the same person who subsequently planned the\r\nbattle of Austerlitz. On learning the plan from Suvaroff, Lord Mulgrave,\r\nwho was no great genius, wrote to London demonstrating its certain failure,\r\nand predicting almost exactly the events that took place.\r\n\r\n[82] Miot de Melito, ch. ix.

Baron Thugut was all yesterday under the\r\ngreatest uneasiness concerning the event which he had reason to apprehend,\r\nbut which was not yet certain. He still retained, however, a slight hope,\r\nfrom the apparent impossibility of anyone's committing such an act of\r\ninfamy and folly. I never saw him or any other man so affected as he was\r\nwhen he communicated this transaction to me to-day. I said that these\r\nfortresses being demanded as pledges of sincerity, the Emperor should have\r\ngiven on the same principle the arms and ammunition of the army. Baron\r\nThugut added that after giving up the soldiers' muskets, the clothes would\r\nbe required off their backs, and that if the Emperor took pains to acquaint\r\nthe world that he would not defend his crown, there would not be wanting\r\nthose who would take it from his head, and perhaps his head with it. He\r\nbecame so strongly affected that, in laying hold of my hand to express the\r\nstrong concern he felt at the notion of having committed me and abused the\r\nconfidence I had reposed in his counsels, he burst into tears and literally\r\nwept. I mention these details because they confirm the assurance that every\r\npart of these feeble measures has either been adopted against his opinion\r\nor executed surreptitiously and contrary to the directions he had given.\"\r\nAfter the final collapse of Austria, Minto writes of Thugut: \"He never for\r\na moment lost his presence of mind or his courage, nor ever bent to weak\r\nand unbecoming counsels.

Locré was Secretary of the Council of State\r\nunder the Consulate and the Empire, and possessed a quantity of records\r\nwhich had not been published before 1827. The Procès Verbal, though\r\nperhaps not always faithful, contains the only record of Napoleon's own\r\nshare in the discussions of the Council of State.\r\n\r\n[99] The statement, so often repeated, that the Convention prohibited\r\nChristian worship, or \"abolished Christianity,\" in France, is a fiction.\r\nThroughout the Reign of Terror the Convention maintained the State Church\r\nas established by the Constituent Assembly in 1791. Though the salaries of\r\nthe clergy fell into arrear, the Convention rejected a proposal to cease\r\npaying them. The non-juring priests were condemned by the Convention to\r\ntransportation, and were liable to be put to death if they returned to\r\nFrance. But where churches were profaned, or constitutional priests\r\nmolested, it was the work of local bodies or of individual Conventionalists\r\non mission, not of the law. The Commune of Paris shut up most, but not all,\r\nof the churches in Paris. Other local bodies did the same. After the Reign\r\nof Terror ended, the Convention adopted the proposal which it had rejected\r\nbefore, and abolished the State salary of the clergy (Sept. 20th, 1794).\r\nThis merely placed all sects on a level. But local fanatics were still busy\r\nagainst religion; and the Convention accordingly had to pass a law (Feb.\r\n23, 1795), forbidding all interference with Christian services. This law\r\nrequired that worship should not be held in a distinctive building (_i.e._\r\nchurch), nor in the open air. Very soon afterwards the Convention (May 23)\r\npermitted the churches to be used for worship. The laws against non-juring\r\npriests were not now enforced, and a number of churches in Paris were\r\nactually given up to non-juring priests. The Directory was inclined to\r\nrenew the persecution of this class in 1796, but the Assemblies would not\r\npermit it; and in July, 1797, the Council of Five Hundred passed a motion\r\ntotally abolishing the legal penalties of non-jurors.

Beer, p. 232.\r\n\r\n[123] Correspondence de Napoleon, xii. 253.\r\n\r\n[124] The story of Pitt's \"Austerlitz look\" preceding his death is so\r\nimpressive and so well known that I cannot resist giving the real facts\r\nabout the reception of the news of Austerlitz in England. There were\r\nfour Englishmen who were expected to witness the battle, Sir A. Paget,\r\nambassador at Vienna, Lord L. Gower, ambassador with the Czar, Lord\r\nHarrington and General Ramsay, military envoys. Of these, Lord\r\nHarrington had left England too late to reach the armies; Sir A. Paget\r\nsat writing despatches at Olmütz without hearing the firing, and on\r\ngoing out after the post left, was astonished to fall in with the\r\nretreating army; Gower was too far in the rear; and General Ramsay\r\nunfortunately went off on that very day to get some new passes. In\r\nconsequence no Englishman witnessed the awful destruction that took\r\nplace; and Paget's despatch, the first that reached England, quite\r\nmisrepresented the battle, treating the defeat as not a decisive one.\r\nPitt actually thought at first that the effect of the battle was\r\nfavourable to his policy, and likely to encourage Prussia in its\r\ndetermination to fight. So late as December 20th the following\r\ninstructions were sent to Harrowby at Berlin: \"Even supposing the\r\nadvantage of the day to have been decidedly with Bonaparte, it must\r\nhave been obtained with a loss which cannot have left his force in a\r\ncondition to contend with the army of Prussia and at the same time to\r\nmake head against the Allies. If on the other hand it should appear\r\nthat the advantage has been with the Allies, there is every reason to\r\nhope that Prussia will come forward with vigour to decide the contest.\"\r\nRecords: Prussia, vol. 196. It was the surrender of Ulm which really\r\ngave Pitt the shock attributed to Austerlitz. The despatch then\r\nwritten--evidently from Pitt's dictation--exhorting the Emperor to do\r\nhis duty, is the most impassioned and soul-stirring thing in the whole\r\npolitical correspondence of the time.\r\n\r\n[125] Hardenberg, ii. 463. Hardenberg, who, in spite of his weak and\r\nambiguous conduct up to the end of 1805, felt bitterly the disgraceful\r\nposition in which Prussia had placed itself, now withdrew from office. \"I\r\nreceived this morning a message from Baron Hardenberg requesting me to call\r\non him. He said that he could no longer remain in office consistently with\r\nhis honour, and that he waited only for the return of Count Haugwitz to\r\ngive up to him the management of his department. 'You know,' he said, 'my\r\nprinciples, and the efforts that I have made in favour of the good cause;\r\njudge then of the pain that I must experience when I am condemned to be\r\naccessory to this measure. You know, probably, that I was an advocate for\r\nthe acquisition of Hanover, but I wished it upon terms honourable to both\r\nparties. I thought it a necessary bulwark to cover the Prussian dominions,\r\nand I thought that the House of Hanover might have been indemnified\r\nelsewhere. But now,' he added, 'j'abhorre les moyens infames par lesquels\r\nnous faisons cette acquisition. Nous pourrions rester les amis de Bonaparte\r\nsans être ses esclaves.' He apologised for this language, and said I must\r\nnot consider it as coming from a Prussian Minister, but from a man who\r\nunbosomed himself to his friend.... I have only omitted the distressing\r\npicture of M. de Hardenberg's agitation during this conversation. He\r\nbewailed the fate of Prussia, and complained of the hardships he had\r\nundergone for the last three months, and of the want of firmness and\r\nresolution in his Prussian Majesty. He several times expressed the hope\r\nthat his Majesty's Government and that of Russia would make some allowances\r\nfor the situation of this country. They had the means, he said, to do it an\r\ninfinity of mischief. The British navy might destroy the Prussian commerce,\r\nand a Russian army might conquer some of her eastern provinces; but\r\nBonaparte would be the only gainer, as thereby Prussia would be thrown\r\ncompletely into his arms.\"--F.

Mr. Jackson\r\nsaid that there could be no accommodation with England till the note\r\nexcluding British vessels was reversed. \"M. de Haugwitz immediately\r\nrejoined, 'I was much surprised when I found that that note had been\r\ndelivered to you.' 'How,' I said, 'can _you_ be surprised who was the\r\nauthor of the measures that give rise to it?' The only answer I received\r\nwas, 'Ah! ne dites pas cela.' He observed that it would be worth\r\nconsidering whether our refusal to acquiesce in the present state of things\r\nmight not bring about one still more disastrous.

In Bianchi, Storia Documentata\r\ndella Diplomazia Europea, i. 334, there is a long protest addressed by\r\nMetternich to Castlereagh on May 26, 1814, referring with great minuteness\r\nto a number of clauses in a secret Treaty signed by all the Powers at\r\nPrague on July 27, 1813, and ratified at London on August 23, giving\r\nAustria the disposal of all Italy. This protest, which has been accepted as\r\ngenuine in Reuchlin's Geschichte Italiens and elsewhere, is, with the\r\nalleged secret Treaty, a forgery. My grounds for this statement are as\r\nfollows:--(1) There was no British envoy at Prague in July, 1813. (2) The\r\nprivate as well as the official letters of Castlereagh to Lord Cathcart of\r\nSept. 13 and 18, and the instructions sent to Lord Aberdeen during August\r\nand September, prove that no joint Treaty existed up to that date, to which\r\nboth England and Austria were parties. Records: Russia, 207, 209 A.\r\nAustria, 105. (3) Lord Aberdeen's reports of his negotiations with\r\nMetternich after this date conclusively prove that almost all Italian\r\nquestions, including even the Austrian frontier, were treated as matters to\r\nbe decided by the Allies in common. While Austria's right to a\r\npreponderance in upper Italy is admitted, the affairs of Rome and Naples\r\nare always treated as within the range of English policy.\r\n\r\n[194] The originals of the Genoese and Milanese petitions for independence\r\nare in Records: Sicily, Vol. 98. \"The Genoese universally desire the\r\nrestoration of their ancient Republic.

On the ground of his ready-money\r\ndealings, it has been supposed that Wellington understood the French\r\npeople. On the contrary, he often showed great want of insight, both in his\r\nacts and in his opinions, when the finer, and therefore more statesmanlike,\r\nsympathies were in question. Thus, in the delicate position of ambassador\r\nof a victorious Power and counsellor of a restored dynasty, he bitterly\r\noffended the French country-population by behaving like a _grand seigneur_\r\nbefore 1789, and hunting with a pack of hounds over their young corn. The\r\nmatter was so serious that the Government of Louis XVIII. had to insist on\r\nWellington stopping his hunts. (Talleyrand et Louis XVIII., p. 141.) This\r\nwant of insight into popular feeling, necessarily resulted in some\r\nportentous blunders: _e.g.,_ all that Wellington could make of\r\nNapoleon's return from Elba was the following:--\"He has acted upon false or\r\nno information, and the King will destroy him without difficulty and in a\r\nshort time.\" Despatches, xii. 268.\r\n\r\n[211] A good English account of Vienna during the Congress will be found in\r\n\"Travels in Hungary,\" by Dr. R.

But the severance of\r\nthe English from the sea required to be guarded against as much as a defeat\r\nof Blücher.

The account which Castlereagh gives of\r\nthe Czar's longing for universal peace appears to refute the theory that\r\nAlexander had some idea of an attack upon Turkey in thus uniting\r\nChristendom.

But there is not a word in Metternich's writings which\r\nshows that this apprehension had at this time entered his mind.

The substance of this secret\r\nclause was communicated to A'Court, the English Ambassador at Naples. \"I\r\nhad no hesitation in saying that anything which contributed to the good\r\nunderstanding now prevailing between Austria and Naples, could not but\r\nprove extremely satisfactory to the British Government.\" A'Court to\r\nCastlereagh, July 18, 1815.

The Military Studies\r\npublished in English in 1833 from his manuscripts prove this. They abound\r\nin acute remarks, and his estimate of the quality of the German soldier, at\r\na time when the Germans were habitually beaten and despised, is very\r\nstriking. He urges that when French infantry fight in three ranks, the\r\ncharge should be made after the two front ranks have fired, without waiting\r\nfor the third to fire. \"The German soldier, formed by the severest\r\ndiscipline, is cooler than any other. He would in the end obtain the\r\nadvantage in this kind of firing if it lasted long.\" (P. 100.) Ney's\r\nparents appear to have been Würtemberg people who had settled in Alsace.\r\nThe name was really Neu (New).\r\n\r\n[268] See the extracts from La Bourdonnaye's printed speech in _Journal\r\ndes Débats_, 19 Novembre: \"Pour arrêter leurs trames criminelles, il faut\r\ndes fers, des bourreaux, des supplices.

Several were sentenced to death in their\r\nabsence; some were acquitted on the singular plea that they had become\r\nsubjects of the Empire of Elba, and so could not be guilty of treason to\r\nthe King of France.\r\n\r\n[270] The sentence was commuted by the King to twelve years' imprisonment.\r\nGeneral Chartran was actually shot. It is stated, though it appears not to\r\nbe clear, that his prosecution began at the same late date. Duvergier de\r\nHauranne, iii. 335.\r\n\r\n[271] The highest number admitted by the Government to have been imprisoned\r\nat any one time under the Law of Public Security was 319, in addition to\r\n750 banished from their homes or placed under surveillance. No one has\r\ncollected statistics of the imprisonments by legal sentence. The old story\r\nthat there were 70,000 persons in prison is undoubtedly an absurd\r\nexaggeration; but the numbers given by the Government, even if true at any\r\none moment, afford no clue to the whole number of imprisonments, for as\r\nfast as one person gets out of prison in France in a time of political\r\nexcitement, another is put in. The writer speaks from personal experience,\r\nhaving been imprisoned in 1871. Any one who has seen how these affairs are\r\nconducted will know how ridiculous it would be to suppose that the central\r\ngovernment has information of every case.\r\n\r\n[272] See, _e.g._, the Pétition aux Deux Chambres, 1816, at the\r\nbeginning of P.L.

It is\r\nso silly that it is hard to believe it to have been written by a grown-up\r\nman. He says of the procession to the Wartburg, \"There have indeed been\r\nprocessions that surpassed this in outward glory and show; but in inner\r\nsignificant value it cannot yield to any.\" But making allowance for the\r\nauthor's personal weakness of head, his book is a singular and instructive\r\npicture of the mental condition of \"Young Germany\" and its teachers at that\r\ntime--a subject that caused such extravagant anxiety to Governments, and so\r\nseriously affected the course of political history. It requires some effort\r\nto get behind the ridiculous side of the students' Teutonism; but there\r\nwere elements of reality there. Persons familiar with Wales will be struck\r\nby the resemblance, both in language and spirit, between the scenes of 1818\r\nand the religious meetings or the Eisleddfodau of the Welsh, a resemblance\r\nnot accidental, but resulting from similarity of conditions, viz., a real\r\nsusceptibility to religious, patriotic, and literary ideas among a people\r\nunacquainted with public or practical life on a large scale. But the\r\nvigorous political action of the Welsh in 1880, when the landed interest\r\nthroughout the Principality lost seats which it had held for centuries,\r\nsurprised only those who had seen nothing but extravagance in the chapel\r\nand the field-meeting. Welsh ardour, hitherto in great part undirected,\r\nthen had a practical effect because English organisation afforded it a\r\nmodel: German ardour in 1817 proved sterile because it had no such example\r\nat hand.\r\n\r\n[280] See the speech in Bernhardi, iii. 669.\r\n\r\n[281] Gentz, D.I., ii. 87, iii. 72.\r\n\r\n[282] Castlereagh, xii. 55, 62.\r\n\r\n[283] Wellington, S.D., xii. 835.\r\n\r\n[284] B. and F.

His account of it in\r\nthis despatch is of the greatest value, bringing out in a way in which no\r\nofficial documents do the conservative and repressive tone of the\r\nConference. The prevalent fear had been that Alexander would break with his\r\nold Allies and make a separate league with France and Spain.

The French original is not in the\r\nBritish Museum.\r\n\r\n[290] The extracts from Sand's diaries, published in a little book in 1821\r\n(Tagebücher, etc.), form a very interesting religious study. The last,\r\nwritten on Dec. 31, 1818, is as follows:--\"I meet the last day of this year\r\nin an earnest festal spirit, knowing well that the Christmas which I have\r\ncelebrated will be my last. If our strivings are to result in anything, if\r\nthe cause of mankind is to succeed in our Fatherland, if all is not to be\r\nforgotten, all our enthusiasm spent in vain, the evildoer, the traitor, the\r\ncorrupter of youth must die. Until I have executed this, I have no peace;\r\nand what can comfort me until I know that I have with upright will set my\r\nlife at stake? O God, I pray only for the right clearness and courage of\r\nsoul, that in that last supreme hour I may not be false to myself\" (p.\r\n174). The reference to the Greeks is in a letter in the English memoir, p.\r\n40.\r\n\r\n[291] The papers of the poet Arndt were seized. Among them was a copy of\r\ncertain short notes made by the King of Prussia, about 1808, on the\r\nuselessness of a _levée en masse_. One of these notes was as\r\nfollows:--\"As soon as a single clergyman is shot\" (_i.e._ by the\r\nFrench) \"the thing would come to an end.\" These words were published in the\r\nPrussian official paper as an indication that Arndt, worse than Sand,\r\nadvocated murdering clergymen!

The intention being that no assembly in any German State\r\nmight claim sovereign power as representing the people. If, for instance,\r\nthe Bavarian Lower House had asserted that it represented the sovereignty\r\nof the people, and that the King was simply the first magistrate in the\r\nState, this would have been an offence against Federal law, and have\r\nentitled the Diet--_i.e._ Metternich--to armed interference. The\r\nGerman State-papers of this time teem with the constitutional distinction\r\nbetween a Representative Assembly (_i.e._ assembly representing\r\npopular sovereignty) and an Assembly of Estates (_i.e._, of particular\r\norders with limited, definite rights, such as the granting of a tax). In\r\ntechnical language, the question at issue was the true interpretation of\r\nthe phrase _Landständische Verfassungen_, used in the 13th article of\r\nthe original Act of Federation.\r\n\r\n[298] See, in Welcker, Urkunden, p. 356, the celebrated paper called\r\n\"Memorandum of a Prussian Statesman, 1822,\" which at the same time\r\nrecommends a systematic underhand rivalry with Austria, in preparation for\r\nan ultimate breach. Few State-papers exhibit more candid and cynical\r\ncunning.\r\n\r\n[299] Ilse, Politische Verfolgungen, p. 31.\r\n\r\n[300] The comparison is the Germans' own, not mine. \"'How savoury a thin\r\nroast veal is!' said one Hamburg beggar to another. 'Where did you eat it?'\r\nsaid his friend, admiringly. 'I never ate it at all, but I smelt it as I\r\npassed a great man's house while the dog was being fed.'\" (Ilse, p. 57.)\r\n\r\n[301] The Commission at Mainz went on working until 1827. It seems to have\r\nbegun to discover real revolutionary societies about 1824.

Had the Constitutional Church of France\r\nsucceeded, Grégoire would have left a great name in religious history.\r\nNapoleon, by one of the most fatal acts of despotism, extinguished a\r\nsociety likely, from its democratic basis and its association with a great\r\nmovement of reform, to become the most liberal and enlightened of all\r\nChurches, and left France to be long divided between Ultramontane dogma and\r\na coarse kind of secularism. The life of Grégoire ought to be written in\r\nEnglish. From the enormous number of improvements for which he laboured,\r\nhis biography would give a characteristic picture of the finer side of the\r\ngeneration of 1789.\r\n\r\n[304] The late Count of Chambord, or Henry V., son of the Duke of Barry,\r\nwas born some months after his father's death.\r\n\r\n[305] Castlereagh, xii. 162, 259. \"The monster Radicalism still lives,\"\r\nCastlereagh sorrowfully admits to Metternich.\r\n\r\n[306] Metternich, iii. 369. \"A man must be like me, born and brought up\r\namid the storm of politics, to know what is the precise meaning of a shout\r\nof triumph like those which now burst from Burdett and Co.

He was a son of the Bourbon Charles\r\nIII. of Spain. His character was that of a jovial, rather stupid farmer,\r\nwhom a freak of fortune had made a king from infancy. A sort of grotesque\r\ncomic element runs through his life, and through every picture drawn by\r\npersons in actual intercourse with him. The following, from one of\r\nBentinck's despatches of 1814 (when Ferdinand had just heard that Austria\r\nhad promised to keep Murat in Naples), is very characteristic: \"I found his\r\nMajesty very much afflicted and very much roused. He expressed his\r\ndetermination never to renounce the rights which God had given him.... He\r\nsaid he might be poor, but he would die honest, and his children should not\r\nhave to reproach him for having given up their rights. He was the son of\r\nthe honest Charles III. ... he was his unworthy offspring, but he would\r\nnever disgrace his family.... On my going away he took me by the hand, and\r\nsaid he hoped I should esteem him as he did me, and begged me to take a\r\nPheasant pye to a gentleman who had been his constant shooting companion.\"\r\nRecords, Sicily, vol. 97.

Gentz was secretary at the Congress of Troppau, as he\r\nhad been at Vienna and Aix-la-Chapelle. His letters exhibit the Austrian\r\nand absolutist view of all European politics with striking clearness. He\r\nspeaks of the change in Richelieu's action as disagreeable but not fatal.\r\n\"Ces pruderies politiques sont sans doute lâcheuses.... La Russie,\r\nl'Autriche, et la Prusse, heureusement libres encore dans leurs mouvements,\r\net assez puissantes pour soutenir ce qu'elles arrêtent, pourraient adopter\r\nsans le concours de l'Angleterre et de la France un système tel que les\r\nbesoins du moment le demandent.\" The description of the three despotisms as\r\n\"happily free in their movements\" is very characteristic of the time.\r\n\r\n[323] This is the system conveniently but incorrectly named Holy Alliance,\r\nfrom its supposed origination in he unmeaning Treaty of Holy Alliance in\r\n1815. The reader will have seen that it took five years of reaction to\r\ncreate a definitive agreement among the monarchs to intervene against\r\npopular changes in other States, and that the principles of any operative\r\nleague planned by Alexander in 1815 would have been largely different from\r\nthose which he actually accepted in 1820. The Alexander who designed the\r\nHoly Alliance was the Alexander who had forced Louis XVIII. to grant the\r\nCharta.\r\n\r\n[324] Castlereagh, xii. 330.\r\n\r\n[325] Metternich, iii. 394. B. and F. State Papers, viii. 1160. Gentz, D.I.,\r\nii. 112. The best narrative of the Congress of Troppau is in Duvergier\r\nde Hauranne, vi. 93. The Life of Canning by his secretary, Stapleton,\r\nthough it is a work of some authority on this period, is full of\r\nmisstatements about Castlereagh. Stapleton says that Castlereagh took no\r\nnotice of the Troppau circular of December 8 until it had been for more\r\nthan a month in his possession, and suggests that he would never have\r\nprotested at all but for the unexpected disclosure of the circular in a\r\nGerman newspaper. As a matter of fact, the first English protest against\r\nthe Troppau doctrine, expressed in a memorandum, \"très long, très positif,\r\nassez dur même, et assez tranchant dans son langage,\" was handed in to the\r\nCongress on December 16 or 19, along with a very unwelcome note to\r\nMetternich. There is some gossip of another of Canning's secretaries in\r\nGreville's Memoirs, i. 105, to the effect that Castlereagh's private\r\ndespatches to Troppau differed in tone from his official ones, which were\r\nonly written \"to throw dust in the eyes of Parliament.\" It is sufficient to\r\nread the Austrian documents of the time, teeming as they do with vexation\r\nand disappointment at England's action, to see that this is a fiction.\r\n\r\n[326] Had Ferdinand's first proposals been accepted by the Neapolitan\r\nParliament, France and England, it was thought, might have insisted on a\r\ncompromise at Laibach. \"Les Gouvernements de France et d'Angleterre\r\nauraient fortement insisté sur l'introduction d'un régime constitutionnel\r\net représentatif, régime que la Cour de Vienne croit absolument\r\nincompatible avec la position des États de l'Italie, et avec la sûreté de\r\nses propres États.\" Gentz, D.I., ii. 110.\r\n\r\n[327] Gentz, Nachlasse (P.

Lest the reader should take a\r\nprejudice against Capodistrias for his cunning, I ought to mention here\r\nthat he was a man of austere disinterestedness in private life, and one of\r\nthe few statesmen of the time who did not try to make money by politics.\r\nHis ambition, which was very great, rose above all the meaner objects which\r\ntempt most men.

These papers, supplemented by the narrative of Duvergier de\r\nHauranne, drawn from the French documents which he specifies, are the\r\nauthority for the history of the Congress. Canning's celebrated speech of\r\nApril, 1823, is an effective _ex parte_ composition rather than a\r\nhistorical summary. The reader who goes to the originals will be struck by\r\nthe immense superiority of Wellington's statements over those of all the\r\nContinental statesmen at Verona, in point, in force, and in good sense, as\r\nwell as in truthfulness.

But the committees also accepted any letters of\r\ndenunciation that might be sent to them, and were bound by law to keep them\r\nsecret, so that in practice the Purificacion became a vast system of\r\nanonymous persecution.\r\n\r\n[339] Historia de la vida de Fernando VII., 1842, iii. 152.\r\n\r\n[340] Decretos del Rey Fernando, vii. 45.\r\n\r\n[341] Decretos, vii. 154.

The ministers of\r\nChrist have been persecuted and sacrificed; the venerable successor of St.\r\nPeter has been outraged; the temples of the Lord have been profaned and\r\ndestroyed; the Holy Gospel depreciated; in fine, the inestimable legacy\r\nwhich Jesus Christ gave in his last supper to secure our eternal felicity,\r\nthe Sacred Host, has been trodden under foot. My soul shudders, and will\r\nnot be able to return to tranquillity until, in union with my children, my\r\nfaithful subjects, I offer to God holocausts of piety,\" etc. But for some\r\nspecimens of Ferdinand's command of the vernacular, of a very different\r\ncharacter, see Wellington, N.S., ii. 37.\r\n\r\n[342] Revolution d'Espagne, examen critique (Paris, 1836), p. 151, from the\r\nlists in the Gaceta de Madrid. The Gaceta for these years is wanting from\r\nthe copy in the British Museum, and in the large collection in that library\r\nof historical and periodical literature relating to Spain I can find no\r\nfirst hand authorities for the judicial murders of these years. Nothing\r\nrelating to the subject was permitted to be printed in Spain for many years\r\nafterwards The work cited in this note, though bearing a French title, and\r\npublished at Paris in 1836, was in fact a Spanish book written in 1824. The\r\ncritical inquiry which has substantiated many of the worst traditions of\r\nthe French Reign of Terror from local records still remains to be\r\nundertaken for this period of Spanish history.\r\n\r\n[343] See e.g., Stapleton, Canning and his Times p. 378. Wellington often\r\nsuggested the use of less peremptory language. Despatches, i. 134,\r\n188. Metternich wrote as follows on hearing at Vienna of Castlereagh's\r\ndeath: \"Castlereagh was the only man in his country who had gained any\r\nexperience in foreign affairs. He had learned to understand me. He was\r\ndevoted to me in heart and spirit, not only from personal inclination, but\r\nfrom conviction. I awaited him here as my second self.\" iii. 391.\r\nMetternich, however, was apt to exaggerate his influence over the English\r\nMinister. It was a great surprise to him that Castlereagh, after gaining\r\ndecisive majorities in the House of Commons on domestic questions in 1820,\r\nin no wise changed the foreign policy expressed in the protest against the\r\nDeclaration of Troppau.\r\n\r\n[344] Stapleton, Political Life of Canning, ii. 18.\r\n\r\n[345] Wellington, i. 188.\r\n\r\n[346] Parl Hist., 12th Dec., 1826.\r\n\r\n[347] Stapleton, Life of Canning, i. 134.

Fallmerayer was\r\nbelieved by some good scholars to have proved that the old Greek race had\r\nutterly perished. More recent inquiries have discredited both Fallmerayer\r\nand his authorities, and tend to establish the conclusion that, except in\r\ncertain limited districts, the Greeks left were always numerous enough to\r\nabsorb the foreign incomers. (Hopf, Griechenland; in Etsch and Gruber's\r\nEncyklopädie, vol. 85, p. 100.)

The\r\nvehicle of expression usually chosen by Koraes for addressing his\r\ncountrymen was the Preface (written in modern Greek) to the edition of an\r\nancient author. The second half of the Preface to the Politics of\r\nAristotle, 1822, is a good specimen of his political spirit and manner. It\r\nwas separately edited by the Swiss scholar, Orelh, with a translation, for\r\nthe benefit of the German Philhellenes. Among the principal linguistic\r\nprefaces are those to Heliodorus 1804, and the Prodromos, or introduction,\r\nto the series of editions called Bibliotheca Græca, begun in 1805, and\r\npublished at the expense of the brothers Zosimas of Odessa Most of the\r\neditions published by Koraes bear on their title page a statement of the\r\npatriotic purpose of the work, and indicate the persons who bore the\r\nexpense. The edition of the Ethics, published immediately after the\r\nmassacre of Chios, bears the affecting words 'At the expense of those who\r\nhave so cruelly suffered in Chios.' The costly form of these editions, some\r\nof which contain fine engravings, seems somewhat inappropriate for works\r\nintended for national instruction. Koraes, however, was not in a hurry. He\r\nthought, at least towards the close of his life, that the Greeks ought to\r\nhave gone through thirty years more of commercial and intellectual\r\ndevelopment before they drew the sword. They would in that case, he\r\nbelieved, have crushed Turkey by themselves and have prevented the Greek\r\nkingdom from becoming the sport of European diplomacy. Much miscellaneous\r\ninformation on Greek affairs before 1820 (rather from the Phanariot point\r\nof view) will be found, combined with literary history in the Cours de\r\nLittérature Grecque of Rhizos Neroulos, 1827. The more recent treatise of R\r\nRhankabes on the same subject (also in French, Paris, 1877) exhibits what\r\nappears to be characteristic of the modern Greeks, the inability to\r\ndistinguish between mere passable performances and really great work.\r\n\r\n[357] Zinkeisen, Geschichte des Osmanischen Reiches, v. 959.\r\n\r\n[358] Koraes, Mémoire sur l'état actual de la civilization de la Grèce:\r\nrepublished in the Lettres Inédites, p. 464.

This curious work, in which the Patriarch at last breaks\r\nout into doggrel, has found its way to the British Museum. It was answered\r\nby Koraes. For the effect of Rhegas' songs on the people, see Fauriel, ii.\r\n18. Mr. Finlay seems to be mistaken in calling Anthimos' book an answer to\r\nthe tract of Eugenios Bulgaris on religious toleration.

Nothing can be more misleading than to say\r\nthat Canning never contemplated the possibility of armed action because a\r\nclause in the Treaty of 1827 made the formal stipulation that the\r\ncontracting Powers would not \"take part in the hostilities between the\r\ncontending parties.\" How, except by armed force, could the Allies \"prevent,\r\nin so far as might be in their power, all collision between the contending\r\nparties,\" which, in the very same clause, they undertook to do? And what\r\nwas the meaning of the stipulation that they should \"transmit instructions\r\nto their Admirals conformable to these provisions\"? Wellington himself,\r\n_before_ the battle of Navarino, condemned the Treaty of London on the\r\nvery ground that it \"specified means of compulsion which were neither more\r\nnor less than measures of war;\" and he protested against the statement that\r\nthe treaty arose directly out of the Protocol of St. Petersburg, which was\r\nhis own work.

The animation of his remarks on all sorts of\r\npoints in English life is wonderful. After a halt at Brussels and at his\r\nJohannisburg estate Metternich returned to Vienna in 1852, and, though not\r\nrestored to office, resumed his great position in society. He lived through\r\nthe Crimean War, on which he wrote numerous memoranda, for whose use it\r\ndoes not appear. Even on the outbreak of war with France in 1859 he was\r\nstill busy with his pen. He survived long enough to hear of the battle of\r\nMagenta, but was spared the sorrow of witnessing the creation of the\r\nKingdom of Italy. He died on the 11th of June, 1859, in his eighty-seventh\r\nyear. Metternich was not the only statesman present at the Congress of\r\nVienna who lived to see the second Napoleonic Empire. Nesselrode, the\r\nRussian Chancellor, lived till 1862; Czartoryski, who was Foreign Minister\r\nof Russia at the time of the battle of Austerlitz, till 1861.\r\n\r\n[413] Adlerstein, Archiv des Ungarischen Ministeriums, i. 27; Irányi et\r\nChassin, i. 184; Springer, ii. 219.\r\n\r\n[414] Casati Nuove Rivelazioni, ii. 72.

It is impossible for me to conceal that the\r\nmain object of my stay here is almost hopeless.\" Even Palmerston, in the\r\nrare moments when he allowed his judgment to master his prepossessions on\r\nthis subject, expressed the same view. He wrote on November 24, 1850,\r\nwarning Reschid Pasha \"the Turkish Empire is doomed to fall by the timidity\r\nand irresolution of its Sovereign and of its Ministers; and it is evident\r\nwe shall ere long have to consider what other arrangements may be set up in\r\nits place.\" Stratford left Constantinople on leave in June, 1852, but\r\nresigned his Embassy altogether in January, 1853.

The Treaty between Austria and Prussia was one of general defensive\r\nalliance, covering also the case of Austria incurring attack through an\r\nadvance into the Principalities. In the event of Russia annexing the\r\nPrincipalities or sending its troops beyond the Balkans the alliance was to\r\nbe offensive.\r\n\r\n[468] Briefwechsel F. Wilhelms mit Bunsen, p. 310.

On November 20, after the Turks had begun war, the King of Prussia\r\nwrote thus to Bunsen (the italics, capitals, and exclamations are his own):\r\n\"All direct help which England _in unchristian folly!!!!!!_ gives TO\r\nISLAM AGAINST CHRISTIANS! will have (besides God's avenging judgment [hear!\r\nhear!]) no other effect than to bring what is now Turkish territory at a\r\nsomewhat later period under Russian dominion\" (Briefwechsel, p. 317). The\r\nreader may think that the insanity to which Frederick William succumbed was\r\nalready mastering him; but the above is no rare specimen of his epistolary\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\n[469] The Treaty of alliance between France and England, to which Prussia\r\nwas asked to accede, contained, however, a clause pledging the contracting\r\nparties \"under no circumstance to seek to obtain from the war any advantage\r\nto themselves.\"\r\n\r\n[470] Eastern Papers, viii.

I thank God on my knees that He deemed me worthy to be, in the best\r\nsense of the word, his [Nicholas'] friend, and to remain true to him. You,\r\ndear Bunsen, thought differently of him, and you will now painfully confess\r\nthis before your conscience, most painfully of all the truth (which all\r\nyour letters in these late bad times have unfortunately shown me but too\r\nplainly), that _you hated him_. You hated him, not as a man, but as\r\nthe representative of a principle, that of violence. If ever, redeemed like\r\nhim through simple faith in Christ's blood, you see him in eternal peace,\r\nthen remember what I now write to you: '_You will beg his pardon_.\r\nEven here, my dear friend, may the blessing of repentance be granted to\r\nyou.\"--Briefwechsel, p. 325.

In the first draft of the Treaty Italy was required to\r\ndeclare war not only on Austria but on all German Governments which should\r\njoin it.

On May 11th, Nigra, Italian\r\nambassador at Paris, reported that Napoleon's ideas on the objects to be\r\nattained by a Congress were as follows:--Venetia to Italy, Silesia to\r\nAustria; the Danish Duchies and other territory in North Germany to\r\nPrussia; the establishment of several small States on the Rhine under\r\nFrench protection; the dispossessed German princes to be compensated in\r\nRoumania. La Marmora, p. 228. Napoleon III. was pursuing in a somewhat\r\naltered form the old German policy of the Republic and the Empire--namely,\r\nthe balancing of Austria and Prussia against one another, and the\r\nestablishment of a French protectorate over the group of secondary States.\r\n\r\n[524] Oesterreichs Kämpfe, ii. 341.

Govone's\r\ndespatches strongly confirm the view that Bismarck was more than a mere\r\npassive listener to French schemes for the acquisition of Belgium. That he\r\noriginated the plan is not probable; that he encouraged it seems to me\r\nquite certain, unless various French and Italian documents unconnected with\r\none another are forgeries from beginning to end. On the outbreak of the war\r\nof 1870 Bismarck published the text of the draft-treaty discussed in 1866\r\nproviding for an offensive and defensive alliance between France and\r\nPrussia, and the seizure of Belgium by France. The draft was in Benedetti's\r\nhandwriting, and written on paper of the French Embassy. Benedetti stated\r\nin answer that he had made the draft at Bismarck's dictation. This might\r\nseem very unlikely were it not known that the draft of the Treaty between\r\nPrussia and Italy in 1866 was actually so written down by Barral, the\r\nItalian Ambassador, at Bismarck's dictation.\r\n\r\n[528] Regelung der Verhältnisse, p. 4. Ausgleich mit Ungarn, p. 9.\r\n\r\n[529] Hungary retained a Ministry of National Defence for its Reserve\r\nForces, and a Finance Ministry for its own separate finance. Thus the\r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs was the only one of the three common Ministries\r\nwhich covered the entire range of a department.\r\n\r\n[530] They had indeed been discovered by French agents in Germany.

Two historical\r\nexpressions belong to Mentana: the \"Never,\" of M. Rouher, and \"The\r\nChassepots have done wonders,\" of General Failly.\r\n\r\n[534] Sorel, i. 40. Hahn, i. 720. Immediately after Mentana, on Nov. 17,\r\n1867, Mazzini wrote to Bismarck and to the Prussian ambassador at Florence,\r\nCount Usedom, stating that Napoleon had resolved to make war on Prussia and\r\nhad proposed an alliance to Victor Emmanuel, who had accepted it for the\r\nprice of Rome. Mazzini offered to employ revolutionary means to frustrate\r\nthis plan, and asked for money and arms. Bismarck showed caution, but did\r\nnot altogether disregard the communication.

King William had\r\nnever stated anything of the kind. His proclamation on entering France, to\r\nwhich Favre appears to have referred, merely said that the war was to be\r\nwaged against the French army, and not against the inhabitants, who, so\r\nlong as they kept quiet, would not be molested.\r\n\r\n[544] Deutsch-Französiche Krieg, vol.
