There has been no considerable time since the\r\nmiddle of the last century when it has not occupied the minds of the\r\nauthor and those who have been associated with him in its creation.\r\nBetween the conception of its plan and its execution there lies a\r\nperiod of more than two generations. Four men have labored zealously\r\nand affectionately upon its pages, and the fruits of more than four\r\nscore men, stimulated to investigation by the first revelations made by\r\nthe author, have been conserved in the ultimate form of the biography.\r\nIt was seventeen years after Mr. Thayer entered upon what proved to be\r\nhis life-task before he gave the first volume to the world--and then\r\nin a foreign tongue; it was thirteen more before the third volume came\r\nfrom the press. This volume, moreover, left the work unfinished, and\r\nthirty-two years more had to elapse before it was completed. When this\r\nwas done the patient and self-sacrificing investigator was dead; he did\r\nnot live to finish it himself nor to see it finished by his faithful\r\ncollaborator of many years, Dr. Deiters; neither did he live to look\r\nupon a single printed page in the language in which he had written that\r\nportion of the work published in his lifetime. It was left for another\r\nhand to prepare the English edition of an American writer’s history of\r\nGermany’s greatest tone-poet, and to write its concluding chapters, as\r\nhe believes, in the spirit of the original author.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances there can be no vainglory in asserting that\r\nthe appearance of this edition of Thayer’s Life of Beethoven deserves\r\nto be set down as a significant occurrence in musical history. In it\r\nis told for the first time in the language of the great biographer the\r\ntrue story of the man Beethoven--his history stripped of the silly\r\nsentimental romance with which early writers and their later imitators\r\nand copyists invested it so thickly that the real humanity, the\r\nhumanliness, of the composer has never been presented to the world. In\r\nthis biography there appears the veritable Beethoven set down in his\r\ntrue environment of men and things--the man as he actually was, the man\r\nas he himself, like Cromwell, asked to be shown for the information of\r\nposterity. It is doubtful if any other great man’s history has been so\r\nencrusted with fiction as Beethoven’s. Except Thayer’s, no biography of\r\nhim has been written which presents him in his true light. The majority\r\nof the books which have been written of late years repeat many of\r\nthe errors and falsehoods made current in the first books which were\r\nwritten about him. A great many of these errors and falsehoods are in\r\nthe account of the composer’s last sickness and death, and were either\r\ninventions or exaggerations designed by their utterers to add pathos\r\nto a narrative which in unadorned truth is a hundredfold more pathetic\r\nthan any tale of fiction could possibly be. Other errors have concealed\r\nthe truth in the story of Beethoven’s guardianship of his nephew,\r\nhis relations with his brothers, the origin and nature of his fatal\r\nillness, his dealings with his publishers and patrons, the generous\r\nattempt of the Philharmonic Society of London to extend help to him\r\nwhen upon his deathbed.\r\n\r\nIn many details the story of Beethoven’s life as told here will be new\r\nto English and American readers; in a few cases the details will be\r\nnew to the world, for the English edition of Thayer’s biography is not\r\na translation of the German work but a presentation of the original\r\nmanuscript, so far as the discoveries made after the writing did not\r\nmar its integrity, supplemented by the knowledge acquired since the\r\npublication of the first German edition, and placed at the service of\r\nthe present editor by the German revisers of the second edition. The\r\neditor of this English edition was not only in communication with Mr.\r\nThayer during the last ten years of his life, but was also associated\r\nto some extent with his continuator and translator, Dr. Deiters. Not\r\nonly the fruits of the labors of the German editors but the original\r\nmanuscript of Thayer and the mass of material which he accumulated\r\ncame into the hands of this writer, and they form the foundation on\r\nwhich the English “Thayer’s Beethoven” rests. The work is a vastly\r\ndifferent one from that which Thayer dreamed of when he first conceived\r\nthe idea of bringing order and consistency into the fragmentary and\r\nhighly colored accounts of the composer’s life upon which he fed his\r\nmind and fancy as a student at college; but it is, even in that part\r\nof the story which he did not write, true to the conception of what\r\nBeethoven’s biography should be. Knowledge of the composer’s life has\r\ngreatly increased since the time when Thayer set out upon his task.\r\nThe first publication of some of the results of his investigations\r\nin his “Chronologisches Verzeichniss” in 1865, and the first volume\r\nof the biography which appeared a year later, stirred the critical\r\nhistorians into activity throughout Europe. For them he had opened up a\r\nhundred avenues of research, pointed out a hundred subjects for special\r\nstudy. At once collectors of autographs brought forth their treasures,\r\nold men opened up the books of their memories, librarians gave eager\r\nsearchers access to their shelves, churches produced their archives,\r\nand hieroglyphic sketches which had been scattered all over Europe\r\nwere deciphered by scholars and yielded up chronological information\r\nof inestimable value. To all these activities Thayer had pointed the\r\nway, and thus a great mass of facts was added to the already great mass\r\nwhich Thayer had accumulated. Nor did Thayer’s labors in the field\r\nend with the first publication of his volumes. So long as he lived he\r\ngathered, ordered and sifted the new material which came under his\r\nobservation and prepared it for incorporation into later editions and\r\nlater volumes. After he was dead his editors continued the work.\r\n\r\nAlexander Wheelock Thayer was born in South Natick, Massachusetts,\r\non October 22nd, 1817, and received a liberal education at Harvard\r\nCollege, whence he was graduated in 1843. He probably felt that he was\r\ncut out for a literary career, for his first work after graduation\r\nwas done in the library of his _Alma Mater_. There interest in the\r\nlife of Beethoven took hold of him. With the plan in his mind of\r\nwriting an account of that life on the basis of Schindler’s biography\r\nas paraphrased by Moscheles, and bringing its statements and those\r\ncontained in the “Biographische Notizen” of Wegeler and Ries and a\r\nfew English accounts into harmony, he went to Europe in 1849 and\r\nspent two years in making researches in Bonn, Berlin, Prague and\r\nVienna. He then returned to America and in 1852 became attached to\r\nthe editorial staff of “The New York Tribune.” It was in a double\r\nsense an attachment; illness compelled him to abandon journalism and\r\nsever his connection with the newspaper within two years, but he never\r\ngave up his interest in it. He read it until the day of his death,\r\nand his acquaintance with the member of the Tribune’s staff who was\r\ndestined to have a part in the completion of his lifework began when,\r\na little more than a generation after he had gone to Europe for the\r\nsecond time, he opened a correspondence with him on a topic suggested\r\nby one of this writer’s criticisms. In 1854 he went to Europe again,\r\nstill fired with the ambition to rid the life-history of Beethoven of\r\nthe defects which marred it as told in the current books. Schindler\r\nhad sold the _memorabilia_ which he had received from Beethoven and\r\nBeethoven’s friend Stephan von Breuning to the Prussian Government,\r\nand the precious documents were safely housed in the Royal Library at\r\nBerlin. It was probably in studying them that Thayer realized fully\r\nthat it was necessary to do more than rectify and harmonize current\r\naccounts of Beethoven’s life if it were correctly to be told. He had\r\nalready unearthed much precious ore at Bonn, but he lacked the money\r\nwhich alone would enable him to do the long and large work which\r\nnow loomed before him. In 1856 he again came back to America and\r\nsought employment, finding it this time in South Orange, New Jersey,\r\nwhere Lowell Mason employed him to catalogue his musical library.\r\nMeanwhile Dr. Mason had become interested in his great project, and\r\nMrs. Mehetabel Adams, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, also. Together they\r\nprovided the funds which enabled him again to go to Europe, where\r\nhe now took up a permanent residence. At first he spent his time in\r\nresearch-travels, visiting Berlin, Bonn, Cologne, Düsseldorf (where\r\nhe found material of great value in the archives of the old Electoral\r\nCourts of Bonn and Cologne), Frankfort, Paris, Linz, Graz, Salzburg,\r\nLondon and Vienna. To support himself he took a small post in the\r\nLegation of the United States at Vienna, but exchanged this after a\r\nspace for the U. S. Consulship at Trieste, to which office he was\r\nappointed by President Lincoln on the recommendation of Senator Sumner.\r\nIn Trieste he remained till his death, although out of office after\r\nOctober 1st, 1882. To Sir George Grove he wrote under date June 1st,\r\n1895: “I was compelled to resign my office because of utter inability\r\nlonger to continue Beethoven work and official labor together.” From\r\nTrieste, when his duties permitted, he went out on occasional exploring\r\ntours, and there he weighed his accumulations of evidence and wrote his\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\nIn his travels Thayer visited every person of importance then\r\nliving who had been in any way associated with Beethoven or had\r\npersonal recollection of him--Schindler, the composer’s factotum and\r\nbiographer; Anselm Hüttenbrenner, in whose arms he died; Caroline van\r\nBeethoven, widow of Nephew Karl; Charles Neate and Cipriani Potter,\r\nthe English musicians who had been his pupils; Sir George Smart,\r\nwho had visited him to learn the proper interpretation of the Ninth\r\nSymphony; Moscheles, who had been a professional associate in Vienna;\r\nOtto Jahn, who had undertaken a like task with his own, but abandoned\r\nit and turned over his gathered material to him; Mähler, an artist\r\nwho had painted Beethoven’s portrait; Gerhard von Breuning, son of\r\nBeethoven’s most intimate friend, who as a lad of fourteen had been\r\na cheery companion of the great man when he lay upon his fatal bed\r\nof sickness;--with all these and many others he talked, carefully\r\nrecording their testimony in his note-books and piling up information\r\nwith which to test the correctness of traditions and printed accounts\r\nand to amplify the veracious story of Beethoven’s life. His industry,\r\nzeal, keen power of analysis, candor and fairmindedness won the\r\nconfidence and help of all with whom he came in contact except the\r\nliterary charlatans whose romances he was bent on destroying in the\r\ninterest of the verities of history. The Royal Library at Berlin sent\r\nthe books in which many of Beethoven’s visitors had written down their\r\npart of the conversations which the composer could not hear, to him at\r\nTrieste so that he might transcribe and study them at his leisure.\r\n\r\nIn 1865, Thayer was ready with the manuscript for Volume I of the work,\r\nwhich contained a sketch of the Courts of the Electors of Cologne at\r\nCologne and Bonn for over a century, told of the music cultivated at\r\nthem and recorded the ancestry of Beethoven so far as it had been\r\ndiscovered. It also carried the history of the composer down to the\r\nyear 1796. In Bonn, Thayer had made the acquaintance of Dr. Hermann\r\nDeiters, Court Councillor and enthusiastic musical littérateur, and to\r\nhim he confided the task of editing and revising his manuscript and\r\ntranslating it into German. The reason which Thayer gave for not at\r\nonce publishing his work in English was that he was unable to oversee\r\nthe printing in his native land, where, moreover, it was not the custom\r\nto publish such works serially. He urged upon his collaborator that he\r\npractise literalness of translation in respect of his own utterances,\r\nbut gave him full liberty to proceed according to his judgment in\r\nthe presentation of documentary evidence. All of the material in the\r\nvolume except the draughts from Wegeler, Ries and Schindler, with which\r\nhe was frequently in conflict, was original discovery, the result\r\nof the labors begun in Bonn in 1849. His principles he set forth in\r\nthese words: “I fight for no theories, and cherish no prejudices; my\r\nsole point of view is the truth.... I have resisted the temptation\r\nto discuss the character of his (Beethoven’s) works and to make such\r\na discussion the foundation of historical speculation, preferring to\r\nleave such matters to those who have a greater predilection for them.\r\nIt appears to me that Beethoven the _composer_ is amply known through\r\nhis works and in this assumption the long and wearisome labors of so\r\nmany years were devoted to Beethoven the _man_.” The plan to publish\r\nhis work in German enabled Thayer to turn over all his documentary\r\nevidence to Deiters in its original shape, a circumstance which saved\r\nhim great labor, but left it for his American editor and continuator.\r\nThe first German volume appeared in 1866; its stimulative effect upon\r\nmusical Europe has been indicated. Volume II came from the press in\r\n1872, Volume III in 1879, both translated and annotated by Deiters.\r\nThey brought the story of Beethoven’s life down to the end of the year\r\n1816, leaving a little more than a decade still to be discussed.\r\n\r\nThe health of Thayer had never been robust, and the long and\r\nunintermittent application to the work of gathering and weighing\r\nevidence had greatly taxed his brain. He became subject to severe\r\nheadaches and after the appearance of the third volume he found it\r\nimpossible to apply himself for even a short time to work upon the\r\nbiography. In July, 1890, he wrote a letter to Sir George Grove which\r\nthe latter forwarded to this writer. In it he tells in words of\r\npathetic gratitude of the unexpected honors showered upon him at Bonn\r\nwhen at the invitation of the Beethoven-Haus Verein he attended the\r\nexhibition and festival given in Beethoven’s birthplace a short time\r\nbefore. Then he proceeds: “Of course the great question was on the lips\r\nof all: When will the fourth volume appear? I could only say: When\r\nthe condition of my head allows it. No one could see or have from my\r\ngeneral appearance the least suspicion that I was not in mental equal\r\nto my physical vigor. In fact, the extreme excitement of these three\r\nweeks took off for the time twenty years of my age and made me young\r\nagain; but afterwards in Hamburg and in Berlin the reaction came.\r\nSpite of the delightful musical parties at Joachim’s, Hausmann’s,\r\nMendelssohn’s ... my head broke down more and more, and since my return\r\nhither, July 3rd, has as yet shown small signs of recuperation. The\r\nextreme importance of working out my fourth volume is more than ever\r\nimpressed upon my mind and weighs upon me like an incubus. But as yet\r\nit is still utterly impossible for me to really work. Of course I only\r\nlive for that great purpose and do not despair. My general health is\r\nsuch that I think the brain must in time recover something of its\r\nvigor and power of labor. What astonishes me and almost creates envy\r\nis to see this wonderful power of labor as exemplified by you and my\r\nneighbor, Burton. But from boyhood I have had head troubles, and what I\r\nwent through with for thirty years in supporting myself and working on\r\nBeethoven is not to be described and excites my wonder that I did not\r\nsuccumb. Well, I will not yet despair.” Thayer’s mind, active enough\r\nin some things, refused to occupy itself with the Beethoven material;\r\nit needed distraction, and to give it that he turned to literary work\r\nof another character. He wrote a book against the Baconian authorship\r\nof Shakespeare’s works; another on the Hebrews in Egypt and their\r\nExodus (which Mr. E. S. Willcox, a friend of many years, published at\r\nhis request in Peoria, Illinois). He also wrote essays and children’s\r\ntales. Such writing he could do and also attend to his consular duties;\r\nbut an hour or two of thought devoted to Beethoven, as he said in\r\na letter to the present writer, brought on a racking headache and\r\nunfitted him for labor of any kind.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile year after year passed by and the final volume of the\r\nbiography was no nearer its completion than in 1880. In fact, beyond\r\nthe selection and ordination of its material, it was scarcely begun.\r\nHis friends and the lovers of Beethoven the world over grew seriously\r\nconcerned at the prospect that it would never be completed. Sharing in\r\nthis concern, the editor of the present edition developed a plan which\r\nhe thought would enable Thayer to complete the work notwithstanding\r\nthe disabilities under which he was laboring. He asked the coöperation\r\nof Novello, Ewer & Co., of London, and got them to promise to send\r\na capable person to Trieste to act as a sort of literary secretary\r\nto Thayer. It was thought that, having all the material for the\r\nconcluding volume on hand chronologically arranged, he might talk it\r\nover with the secretary, but without giving care to the manner of\r\nliterary presentation. The secretary was then to give the material a\r\nproper setting and submit it to Thayer for leisurely revision. Very\r\nhopefully, and with feelings of deep gratitude to his friends, the\r\nEnglish publishers, the American editor submitted his plan; but Thayer\r\nwould have none of it. Though unable to work upon the biography for\r\nan hour continuously, he yet clung to the notion that some day he\r\nwould not only finish it but also rewrite the whole for English and\r\nAmerican readers. From one of the letters placed at my disposal by Sir\r\nGeorge Grove, it appears that subsequently (in 1892) there was some\r\ncorrespondence between an English publisher and Mr. Thayer touching an\r\nEnglish edition. The letter was written to Sir George on June 1st,\r\n1895. In it he says: “I then hoped to be able to revise and prepare\r\nit (the Beethoven MS.) for publication myself, and was able to begin\r\nthe labor and arrange with a typewriting woman to make the clean copy.\r\nHow sadly I failed I wrote you. Since that time the subject has not\r\nbeen renewed between us. I am now compelled to relinquish all hope of\r\never being able to do the work. There are two great difficulties to be\r\novercome: the one is that all letters and citations are in the original\r\nGerman as they were sent to Dr. Deiters; the other, there is much to\r\nbe condensed, as I always intended should be for this reason: From the\r\nvery first chapter to the end of Vol. III, I am continually in conflict\r\nwith all previous writers and was compelled, therefore, to show in\r\nmy text that I was right by so using my materials that the reader\r\nshould be taken along step by step and compelled to see the truth for\r\nhimself. Had all my arguments been given in notes nine readers out of\r\nten would hardly have read them, and I should have been involved in\r\nnumberless and endless controversies. Now the case is changed. A. W.\r\nT’s novelties are now, with few if any exceptions, accepted as facts\r\nand can, in the English edition, be used as such. Besides this, there\r\nis much new matter to be inserted and some corrections to be made from\r\nthe appendices of the three German volumes. The prospect now is that\r\nI may be able to do some of this work, or, at all events, go through\r\nmy MS. page by page and do much to facilitate its preparation for\r\npublication in English. I have no expectation of ever receiving any\r\npecuniary recompense for my 40 years of labor, for my many years of\r\npoverty arising from the costs of my extensive researches, for my--but\r\nenough of this also.” In explanation of the final sentence in this\r\nletter it may be added that Thayer told the present writer that he had\r\nnever received a penny from his publisher for the three German volumes;\r\nnothing more, in fact, than a few books which he had ordered and for\r\nwhich the publisher made no charge.\r\n\r\nThus matters rested when Thayer died on July 15th, 1897. The thought\r\nthat the fruits of his labor and great sacrifices should be lost to the\r\nworld even in part was intolerable. Dr. Deiters, with undiminished zeal\r\nand enthusiasm, announced his willingness to revise the three published\r\nvolumes for a second edition and write the concluding volume. Meanwhile\r\nall of Thayer’s papers had been sent to Mrs. Jabez Fox of Cambridge,\r\nMassachusetts, the author’s niece and one of his heirs. There was a\r\nlarge mass of material, and it became necessary to sift it in order\r\nthat all that was needful for the work of revision and completion\r\nmight be placed in the hands of Dr. Deiters. This work was done, at\r\nMrs. Fox’s request, by the present writer, who, also at Mrs. Fox’s\r\nrequest, undertook the task of preparing this English edition. Dr.\r\nDeiters accomplished the work of revising Volume I, which was published\r\nby Weber, the original publisher of the German volumes, in 1891. He\r\nthen decided that before taking up the revision of Volumes II and III\r\nhe would bring the biography to a conclusion. He wrote, not the one\r\nvolume which Thayer had hoped would suffice him, but two volumes, the\r\nmass of material bearing on the last decade of Beethoven’s life having\r\ngrown so large that it could not conveniently be comprehended in a\r\nsingle tome, especially since Dr. Deiters had determined to incorporate\r\ncritical discussions of the composer’s principal works in the new\r\nedition. The advance sheets of Volume IV were in Dr. Deiters’s hands\r\nwhen, full of years and honors, he died on May 1st, 1907. Breitkopf and\r\nHärtel had meanwhile purchased the German copyright from Weber, and\r\nthey chose Dr. Hugo Riemann to complete the work of revision. Under Dr.\r\nRiemann’s supervision Volumes IV and V were brought out in 1908, and\r\nVolumes II and III in 1910-1911.\r\n\r\nNot until this had been accomplished could the American collaborator\r\ngo systematically to work on his difficult and voluminous task, for\r\nhe had determined to use as much as possible of Thayer’s original\r\nmanuscript and adhere to Thayer’s original purpose and that expressed\r\nin his letter to Sir George Grove. He also thought it wise to condense\r\nthe work so as to bring it within three volumes and to seek to enhance\r\nits readableness in other ways. To this end he abolished the many\r\nappendices which swell the German volumes, and put their significant\r\nportions into the body of the narrative; he omitted many of the\r\nhundreds of foot-notes, especially the references to the works of the\r\nearlier biographers, believing that the special student would easily\r\nfind the sources if he wished to do so, and the general reader would\r\nnot care to verify the statements of one who has been accepted as the\r\ncourt of last resort in all matters of fact pertaining to Beethoven,\r\nthe man; he also omitted many letters and presented the substance of\r\nothers in his own words for the reason that they can all be consulted\r\nin the special volumes which contain the composer’s correspondence;\r\nof the letters and other documents used in the pages which follow, he\r\nmade translations for the sake of accuracy as well as to avoid conflict\r\nwith the copyright privileges of the publishers of English versions.\r\nBeing as free as the German editors in respect of the portion of the\r\nbiography which did not come directly from the pen of Thayer, the\r\neditor of this English edition chose his own method of presentation\r\ntouching the story of the last decade of Beethoven’s life, keeping\r\nin view the greater clearness and rapidity of narrative which, he\r\nbelieved, would result from a grouping of material different from\r\nthat followed by the German editors in their adherence to the strict\r\nchronological method established by Thayer.\r\n\r\nA large number of variations from the text of the original German\r\nedition are explained in the body of this work or in foot-notes. In\r\ncases where the German editors were found to be in disagreement with\r\nthe English manuscript in matters of opinion merely, the editor has\r\nchosen to let Mr. Thayer’s arguments stand, though, as a rule, he has\r\nnoted the adverse opinions of the German revisers also. A prominent\r\ninstance of this kind is presented by the mysterious love-letter found\r\nsecreted in Beethoven’s desk after his death. Though a considerable\r\nliterature has grown up around the “Immortal Beloved” since Thayer\r\nadvanced the hypothesis that the lady was the Countess Therese\r\nBrunswick, the question touching her identity and the dates of the\r\nletters is still as much an open one as it was when Thayer, in his\r\ncharacteristic manner, subjected it to examination. This editor has,\r\ntherefore, permitted Thayer not only to present his case in his own\r\nwords, but helped him by bringing his scattered pleadings and briefs\r\ninto sequence. He has also outlined in part the discussion which\r\nfollowed the promulgation of Thayer’s theory, and advanced a few\r\nfugitive reflections of his own. The related incident of Beethoven’s\r\nvain matrimonial project has been put into a different category by\r\nnew evidence which came to light while Dr. Riemann was engaged in his\r\nrevisory work. It became necessary, therefore, that the date of that\r\nincident be changed from 1807, where Thayer had put it, to 1810. By\r\nthis important change Beethoven’s relations to Therese Malfatti were\r\nmade to take on a more serious attitude than Thayer was willing to\r\naccord them.\r\n\r\nIn this edition, finally, more importance is attached to the so-called\r\nFischer Manuscript than Thayer was inclined to give it, although he,\r\nsomewhat grudgingly we fear, consented that Dr. Deiters should print it\r\nwith critical comments in the Appendix of his Vol. I. The manuscript,\r\nthough known to Thayer, had come to the attention of Dr. Deiters too\r\nlate for use in the narrative portion of the volume, though it was\r\nthus used in the second edition. The story of the manuscript, which\r\nis now preserved in the museum of the Beethoven-Haus Verein in Bonn,\r\nis a curious one. Its author was Gottfried Fischer, whose ancestors\r\nfor four generations had lived in the house in the Rheingasse which\r\nonly a few years ago was still, though mendaciously, pointed out to\r\nstrangers as the house in which Beethoven was born. Fischer, who lived\r\ntill 1864, was born in the house which formerly stood on the site of\r\nthe present building known as No. 934, ten years after Beethoven’s eyes\r\nopened to the light in the Bonngasse. At the time of Fischer’s birth\r\nthe Beethoven family occupied a portion of the house and Fischer’s\r\nfather and the composer’s father were friends and companions. There,\r\ntoo, had lived the composer’s grandfather. Gottfried Fischer had a\r\nsister, Cäcilia Fischer, who was born eight years before Beethoven;\r\nshe remained unmarried and lived to be 85 years old, dying on May\r\n23rd, 1845. The festivities attending the unveiling of the Beethoven\r\nmonument in 1838 brought many visitors to Bonn and a natural curiosity\r\nconcerning the relics of the composer. Inquirers were referred to\r\nthe house in the Rheingasse, then supposed to be the birthplace of\r\nthe composer, where the Fischers, brother and sister, still lived.\r\nThey told their story and were urged by eager listeners to put it\r\ninto writing. This Gottfried did the same year, but, keeping the\r\nmanuscript in hand, he added to it at intervals down to the year 1857\r\nat least. He came to attach great value to his revelations and as\r\ntime went on embellished his recital with a mass of notes, many of no\r\nvalue, many consisting of iterations and reiterations of incidents\r\nalready recorded, and also with excerpts from books to which, in his\r\nsimplicity, he thought that nobody but himself had access. He was\r\nan uneducated man, ignorant even of the correct use of the German\r\nlanguage; it is, therefore, not surprising that much of his record is\r\nutterly worthless; but mixed with the dross there is much precious\r\nmetal, especially in the spinster’s recollection of the composer’s\r\nfather and grandfather, for while Gottfried grew senile his sister\r\nremained mentally vigorous to the end. Thayer examined the document and\r\noffered to buy it, but was dissuaded by the seemingly exorbitant price\r\nwhich the old man set upon it. It was finally purchased for the city’s\r\narchives by the Oberbürgermeister and thus came to the notice of Dr.\r\nDeiters. His use of it has been followed by the present editor.\r\n\r\n    HENRY EDWARD KREHBIEL.\r\n\r\n    Blue Hill, Maine, U. S.

In the spring of 1920 the\r\nBeethoven Association, composed of musicians of high rank, who had\r\ngiven a remarkably successful series of concerts of Beethoven’s\r\nchamber-music in New York in the season 1919-20, at the suggestion of\r\nO. G. Sonneck and Harold Bauer resolved to devote the proceeds of the\r\nconcerts to promoting the publication of Thayer’s biography. To this\r\nact of artistic philanthropy the appearance of the work is due.\r\n\r\n    H. E. K.\r\n    Blue Hill, Maine, U. S.

The first to fall were the\r\nnumerous ecclesiastical-civil members of the old, loose confederation,\r\nsome of which had played no ignoble nor unimportant part in the advance\r\nof civilization; but their day was past. The people of these states had\r\nin divers respects enjoyed a better lot than those who were subjects\r\nof hereditary rulers, and the old German saying: “It is good to dwell\r\nunder the crook,” had a basis of fact. At the least, they were not sold\r\nas mercenary troops; their blood was not shed on foreign fields to\r\nsupport their princes’ ostentatious splendor, to enable mistresses and\r\nill-begotten children to live in luxury and riot. But the antiquated\r\nideas to which the ecclesiastical rulers held with bigoted tenacity had\r\nbecome a barrier to progress, the exceptions being too few to render\r\ntheir farther existence desirable. These members of the empire, greatly\r\ndiffering in extent, population, wealth and political influence, were\r\nruled with few or no exceptions by men who owed their positions to\r\nelection by chapters or other church corporations, whose numbers were\r\nso limited as to give full play to every sort of intrigue; but they\r\ncould not assume their functions until their titles were confirmed\r\nby the Pope as head of the church, and by the Emperor as head of the\r\nconfederation. Thus the subject had no voice in the matter, and it\r\nhardly need be said that his welfare and prosperity were never included\r\namong the motives and considerations on which the elections turned.\r\n\r\nThe sees, by their charters and statutes, we think without exception,\r\nwere bestowed upon men of noble birth. They were benefices and\r\nsinecures for younger sons of princely houses; estates set apart\r\nand consecrated to the use, emolument and enjoyment of German John\r\nLacklands. In the long list of their incumbents, a name here and\r\nthere appears, that calls up historic associations;--a man of letters\r\nwho aided in the increase or diffusion of the cumbrous learning of\r\nhis time; a warrior who exchanged his robes for a coat of mail; a\r\npolitician who played a part more or less honorable or the reverse in\r\nthe affairs and intrigues of the empire, and, very rarely, one whose\r\ndaily walk and conversation reflected, in some measure, the life and\r\nprinciples of the founder of Christianity. In general, as they owed\r\ntheir places wholly to political and family influences, so they assumed\r\nthe vows and garb of churchmen as necessary steps to the enjoyment of\r\nlives of affluence and pleasure. So late as far into the eighteenth\r\ncentury, travelling was slow, laborious and expensive. Hence, save for\r\nthe few more wealthy and powerful, journeys, at long intervals, to a\r\ncouncil, an imperial coronation or a diet of the empire, were the rare\r\ninterruptions to the monotony of their daily existence. Not having the\r\npower to transmit their sees to their children, these ecclesiastics\r\nhad the less inducement to rule with an eye to the welfare of their\r\nsubjects: on the other hand, the temptation was very strong to augment\r\ntheir revenues for the benefit of relatives and dependents, and\r\nespecially for the gratification of their own tastes and inclinations,\r\namong which the love of splendor and ostentatious display was a\r\nfruitful source of waste and extravagance.\r\n\r\nConfined so largely to their own small capitals, with little\r\nintercourse except with their immediate neighbors, they were far more\r\ndependent upon their own resources for amusement than the hereditary\r\nprinces: and what so obvious, so easily obtained and so satisfactory\r\nas music, the theatre and the dance! Thus every little court became a\r\nconservatory of these arts, and for generations most of the great names\r\nin them may be found recorded in the court calendars. One is therefore\r\nnot surprised to learn how many of the more distinguished musical\r\ncomposers began life as singing boys in cathedral choirs of England\r\nand Germany. The secular princes, especially those of high rank,\r\nhad, besides their civil administration, the stirring events of war,\r\nquestions of public policy, schemes and intrigues for the advancement\r\nof family interests and the like, to engage their attention; but the\r\necclesiastic, leaving the civil administration, as a rule, in the\r\nhands of ministers, had little to occupy him officially but a tedious\r\nroutine of religious forms and ceremonies; to him therefore the\r\ntheatre, and music for the mass, the opera, the ball-room, and the\r\nsalon, were matters of great moment--they filled a wide void and were\r\ncherished accordingly.\r\n\r\nCOLOGNE AND ITS ELECTORS\r\n\r\nThe three German ecclesiastical princes who possessed the greatest\r\npower and influence were the Archbishops of Mayence, Trèves and\r\nCologne--Electors of the Empire and rulers of the fairest regions of\r\nthe Rhine. Peace appears hardly to have been known between the city of\r\nCologne and its earlier archbishops; and, in the thirteenth century, a\r\nlong-continued and even bloody quarrel resulted in the victory of the\r\ncity. It remained a free imperial town. The archbishops retained no\r\ncivil or political power within its walls, not even the right to remain\r\nthere more than three days at any one time. Thus it happened, that in\r\nthe year 1257 Archbishop Engelbert selected Bonn for his residence, and\r\nformally made it the capital of the electorate, as it remained until\r\nelector and court were swept away in 1794.\r\n\r\nOf the last four Electors of Cologne, the first was Joseph Clemens,\r\na Bavarian prince, nephew of his predecessor Maximilian Heinrich.\r\nThe choice of the chapter by a vote of thirteen to nine had been\r\nCardinal Fürstenberg; but his known, or supposed, devotion to the\r\ninterests of the French king had prevented the ratification of the\r\nelection by either the Emperor or the Pope. A new one being ordered,\r\nresulted in favor of the Bavarian, then a youth of eighteen years. The\r\nPope had ratified his election and appointed a bishop to perform his\r\necclesiastical functions _ad interim_, and the Emperor invested him\r\nwith the electoral dignity December 1, 1689. Vehse says of him:\r\n\r\n     Like two of his predecessors he was the incumbent of five sees; he\r\n     was Archbishop of Cologne, Bishop of Hildesheim, Liège, Ratisbon\r\n     and Freisingen. His love for pomp and splendor was a passion which\r\n     he gratified in the magnificence of his court. He delighted to\r\n     draw thither beautiful and intellectual women. Madame de Raysbeck,\r\n     and Countess Fugger, wife of his chief equerry, were his declared\r\n     favorites. For seventeen years, that is, until the disastrous year\r\n     1706, when Fénelon consecrated him, he delayed assuming his vows.\r\n     He held the opinion, universal in the courts of those days, that\r\n     he might with a clear conscience enjoy life after the manner of\r\n     secular princes. In pleasing the ladies, he was utterly regardless\r\n     of expense, and for their amusement gave magnificent balls,\r\n     splendid masquerades, musical and dramatic entertainments, and\r\n     hunting parties.\r\n\r\nSt. Simon relates that several years of his exile were passed at\r\nValenciennes, where, though a fugitive, he followed the same round\r\nof costly pleasures and amusements. He also records one of the\r\nElector’s jests which in effrontery surpasses anything related of\r\nhis contemporary, Dean Swift. Some time after his consecration, he\r\ncaused public notice to be given, that on the approaching first of\r\nApril he would preach. At the appointed time he mounted the pulpit,\r\nbowed gravely, made the sign of the cross, shouted “Zum April!” (April\r\nfool!), and retired amid a flourish of trumpets and the rolling of\r\ndrums.\r\n\r\nDr. Ennen labors energetically to prove that Joseph Clemens’s fondness\r\nin later years for joining in all grand church ceremonies rested\r\nupon higher motives than the mere pleasure of displaying himself in\r\nhis magnificent robes; and affirms that after assuming his priestly\r\nvows he led a life devoted to the church and worthy of his order;\r\nthenceforth never seeing Madame de Raysbeck, mother of his illegitimate\r\nchildren, except in the presence of a third person. It seems proper\r\nto say this much concerning a prince whose electorship is the point\r\nof departure for notices of music and musicians in Bonn during the\r\neighteenth century; a prince whose fondness for the art led him at\r\nhome and in exile to support both vocal and instrumental bands on a\r\nscale generous for that age; and who, moreover, made some pretensions\r\nto the title of composer himself, as we learn from a letter which\r\nunder date of July 20, 1720, he wrote to a court councillor Rauch\r\nto accompany eleven of his motets. It is an amusingly frank letter,\r\nbeginning with a confession that he was an _Ignorant_ who knew nothing\r\nabout notes and had absolutely no knowledge of _musique_, wherefore he\r\nadmits that his manner of composing is “very odd,” being compelled to\r\nsing anything that came into his head to a composer whose duty it was\r\nto bring the ideas to paper. Nevertheless he is quite satisfied with\r\nhimself, “At all events I must have a good ear and _gusto_, for the\r\npublic that has heard has always approved. But the _methodum_ which I\r\nhave adopted is that of the bees that draw and collect the honey from\r\nthe sweetest flowers; so, also, I have taken all that I have composed\r\nfrom good masters whose _Musikalien_ pleased me. Thus I freely confess\r\nmy pilfering, which others deny and try to appropriate what they have\r\ntaken from others. Let no one, therefore, get angry if he hears old\r\narias in it, for, as they are beautiful, the old is not deprived of its\r\npraise.... I ascribe everything to the grace of God who enlightened me,\r\nthe unknowing, to do these things.” Not all “composers,” royal or mean,\r\nare as honest as the old Elector!\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate for the present purpose, that the portion of the\r\nelectoral archives discovered after a lapse of nearly seventy years\r\nand now preserved at Düsseldorf, consists so largely of documents\r\nrelating to the musical establishment of the court at Bonn during the\r\nlast century of its existence. They rarely afford information upon\r\nthe character of the music performed, but are sufficiently complete,\r\nwhen supplemented by the annual Court Calendars, to determine with\r\nreasonable correctness the number, character, position and condition\r\nof its members. The few petitions and decrees hereafter to be given\r\nin full because of their connection with the Beethovens, suffice for\r\nspecimens of the long series of similar documents, uniform in character\r\nand generally of too little interest to be worth transcription.\r\n\r\nIn 1695 a decree issued at Liège by Joseph Clemens, then in that city\r\nas titular bishop, though not consecrated, adds three new names to the\r\n“Hoff-Musici,” one of which, Van den Eeden, constantly reappears in the\r\ndocuments and calendars down to the year 1782. From a list of payments\r\nat Liège in the second quarter of 1696, we find that Henri Vandeneden\r\n(Heinrich Van den Eeden) was a bass singer, and that the aggregate\r\nof vocalists, instrumentists, with the organ-blower (_calcant_), was\r\neighteen persons.\r\n\r\nReturned to Bonn, Joseph Clemens resumed his plan of improving his\r\nmusic, and for those days of small orchestras and niggardly salaries he\r\nset it upon a rather generous foundation. A decree of April 1, 1698,\r\nput in force the next month, names 22 persons with salaries aggregating\r\n8,890 florins.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL VICISSITUDES OF THE ELECTORATE\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Maximilian Heinrich the government passed into the\r\nhands of Cardinal Fürstenberg, his coadjutor, who owed the position to\r\nthe intrigues of Louis XIV, and now used it by all possible means to\r\npromote French interests. The king’s troops under French commanders,\r\nhe admitted into the principal towns of the electorate, and, for his\r\nown protection, a French garrison of 10,000 men into Bonn. War was\r\nthe consequence; an imperial army successfully invaded the province,\r\nand, advancing to the capital, subjected its unfortunate inhabitants\r\nto all the horrors of a relentless siege, that ended October 15, 1689,\r\nin the expulsion of the garrison, now reduced to some 3900 men, of\r\nwhom 1500 were invalids. Yet in the war of the Spanish Succession\r\nwhich opened in 1701, notwithstanding the terrible lesson taught only\r\neleven years before, the infatuated Joseph Clemens embraced the party\r\nof Louis. Emperor Leopold treated him with singular mildness, in vain.\r\nThe Elector persisted. In 1702 he was therefore excluded from the\r\ncivil government and fled from Bonn, the ecclesiastical authority in\r\nCologne being empowered by the Emperor to rule in his stead. The next\r\nyear, the great success of the French armies against the allies was\r\ncelebrated by Joseph Clemens with all pomp in Namur, where he then was;\r\nbut his triumph was short. John Churchill, then Earl of Marlborough,\r\ntook the field as commander-in-chief of the armies of the allies. His\r\nforesight, energy and astonishing skill in action justified Addison’s\r\nsimile--whether sublime or only pompous--of the angel riding in the\r\nwhirlwind and directing the storm. He was soon at Cologne, whence he\r\ndespatched Cochorn to besiege Bonn. That great general executed his\r\ntask with such skill and impetuosity, that on May 15 (1703) all was\r\nready for storming the city, when d’Allègre, the French commander,\r\noffered to capitulate, and on the 19th was allowed to retire. “Now\r\nwas Bonn for the third time wrested from the hands of the French and\r\nrestored to the archbishopric, but alas, in a condition that aroused\r\nindignation, grief and compassion on all sides,” says Müller.\r\n\r\nLeopold was still kindly disposed toward Joseph Clemens, but he\r\ndied May 5, 1705, and his successor, Joseph I, immediately declared\r\nhim under the ban of the Empire. This deprived him of the means and\r\nopportunities, as Elector, for indulging his passion for pomp and\r\ndisplay, while his neglect hitherto, under dispensations from the\r\nPope, to take the vows necessary to the performance of ecclesiastical\r\nfunctions, was likewise fatal to that indulgence as archbishop. But\r\nthis could be remedied; Fénelon, the famous Archbishop of Cambray,\r\nordained him subdeacon August 15, 1706; the Bishop of Tournay made\r\nhim deacon December 8, and priest on the 25th; on January 1, 1707,\r\nhe read his first mass at Lille, and indulged his passion for parade\r\nto the full, as a pamphlet describing the incident, and silver and\r\ncopper medals commemorating it, still evince. “Two years later, May 1,\r\n1709, Joseph Clemens received from Fénelon in Ryssel (Lille) episcopal\r\nconsecration and the pallium.”--(Müller.) Upon the victory of Oudenarde\r\nby Marlborough, and the fall of Lille, he took refuge in Mons. The\r\ntreaty of Rastadt, March, 1714, restored him to his electoral dignities\r\nand he returned to the Rhine; but Dutch troops continued to hold Bonn\r\nuntil December 11, 1715. On the morning of that day they evacuated\r\nthe city and in the afternoon the Elector entered in a grand, solemn\r\nprocession commemorated by an issue of silver medals.\r\n\r\nDuring all these vicissitudes Joseph Clemens, from whatever source\r\nhe derived the means, did not suffer his music to deteriorate and,\r\nreturned to Bonn, no sooner was the public business regulated and\r\nrestored to its former routine than he again turned his attention to\r\nits improvement.\r\n\r\nJoseph Clemens died November 12, 1723, having previously secured the\r\nsuccession to his nephew Clemens August, last of the five Electors\r\nof Cologne of the Bavarian line. The new incumbent, third son of\r\nMaximilian Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria and his second wife, a daughter\r\nof the celebrated John Sobieski of Poland, was born August 17, 1700,\r\nat Brussels, where his father resided at the time as Governor General.\r\nFrom his fourth to his fifteenth year he had been held in captivity\r\nby the Austrians at Klagenfurt and Gratz; then, having been destined\r\nfor the church, he spent several years at study in Rome. As a child\r\nin 1715 he had been appointed coadjutor to the Bishop of Regensburg;\r\nin 1719 he was elected to the two sees of Paderborn and Münster made\r\nvacant by the death of his brother Moritz, was chosen coadjutor to his\r\nuncle of Cologne in 1722, made his solemn entry into Bonn as elector\r\nMay 15, 1724, was the same year also elected Bishop of Hildesheim, in\r\n1725 Provost of the Cathedral at Liège, 1728 Bishop of Osnabrück, and,\r\nfinally, in 1732 reached the dignity of Grand Master of the Teutonic\r\nOrder.\r\n\r\nTHE RULE OF ELECTOR CLEMENS AUGUST\r\n\r\nHis rule is distinguished in the annals of the electorate for little\r\nelse than the building, repairing, renewing and embellishing of\r\npalaces, hunting-seats, churches, convents, and other edifices. At\r\nBonn he erected the huge pile the foundation of which had been laid\r\nby his uncle, now the seat of the university. The handsome City Hall\r\nwas also his work; the villa at Poppelsdorf was enlarged by him into\r\na small palace, Clemensruhe, now the University Museum of Natural\r\nHistory. In Brühl, the Augustusburg, now a Prussian royal palace,\r\ndates from his reign, and Münster, Mergentheim, Arnsberg and other\r\nplaces show similar monuments of his prodigality in the indulgence of\r\nhis taste for splendor. “Monstrous were the sums,” says Dr. Ennen,\r\n“squandered by him in the purchase of splendid ornaments, magnificent\r\nequipages, furniture costly for its variety, and of curious works of\r\nart; upon festivities, sleighing-parties, masquerades, operas, dramas\r\nand ballets; upon charlatans, swindlers, female vocalists, actors and\r\ndancers. His theatre and opera alone cost him 50,000 thalers annually\r\nand the magnificence of his masked balls, twice a week in winter, is\r\nproof sufficient that no small sums were lavished upon them.”\r\n\r\nThe aggregate of the revenues derived from the several states of which\r\nClemens August was the head nowhere appears; but the civil income of\r\nthe electorate alone had, in his later years, risen from the million\r\nof florins of his predecessor to about the same number of thalers--an\r\nincrease of some 40 per centum; added to this were large sums derived\r\nfrom the church, and subsidies from Austria, France and the sea-coast\r\nstates amounting to at least 14,000,000 francs; indeed, during the\r\nElector’s last ten years the French subsidies alone made an aggregate\r\nof at least 7,300,000 francs; in 1728 Holland paid on account of\r\nthe Clemens Canal 76,000 thalers. At the centennial opening of the\r\nstrong-box of the Teutonic Order he obtained the fat accumulations of\r\na hundred years; and 25 years later he opened it again. Yet, though\r\nduring his rule peace was hardly interrupted in his part of Europe, he\r\nplunged ever deeper and more inextricably into debt, leaving one of\r\nlarge proportions as his legacy to his successor. He was a bad ruler,\r\nbut a kindly, amiable and popular man. How should he know or feel the\r\nvalue of money or the necessity of prudence? His childhood had been\r\nspent in captivity, his student years in Rome, where, precisely at\r\nthat period, poetry and music were cultivated, if not in very noble\r\nand manly forms, at least with a Medicean splendor. The society of\r\nthe Arcadians was in full activity. True, both Clemens August and\r\nhis brother were under the age which enabled them to be enrolled as\r\n“Shepherds,” and consequently their names appear neither in Crescembini\r\nnor in Quadrio; but it is not to be supposed that two young princes,\r\nalready bishops by election and certain of still higher dignities in\r\nthe future, were excluded from the palaces of Ruspoli and Ottoboni,\r\nfrom those brilliant literary, artistic and luxurious circles in which,\r\nonly half a dozen years before, their young countryman, the musician\r\nHandel, had found so cordial a welcome. Those were very expensive\r\ntastes, as the citation from Ennen shows, which the future elector\r\nbrought with him from Rome. Italian palaces, Italian villas, churches,\r\ngardens, music, songstresses, mistresses, an Italian holy staircase on\r\nthe Kreuzberg (leading to nothing); Italian pictures, mosaics and, what\r\nnot? All these things cost money--but must he not have them?\r\n\r\nThis elector is perhaps the only archbishop on record to whose epitaph\r\nmay truthfully be added: “He danced out of this world into some\r\nother”;--which happened in this wise: Having, in the winter of 1760-61,\r\nby some unexpected stroke of good fortune, succeeded in obtaining from\r\nthe usually prudent and careful bankers of Holland a loan of 80,000\r\nthalers, he embraced the opportunity of making a long-desired visit to\r\nhis family in Munich. Owing to a sudden attack of illness he was once\r\non the point of turning back soon after leaving Bonn. He persevered,\r\nhowever, reached Coblenz and crossed over to the palace of the Elector\r\nof Trèves at Ehrenbreitstein, where he arrived at 4 P.M. February 5,\r\n1761. At dinner an hour later he was unable to eat; but at the ball,\r\nwhich followed, he could not resist the fascination of the Baroness\r\nvon Waldendorf--sister of His Transparency of Trèves--and danced with\r\nher “eight or nine turns.” Of course he could not refuse a similar\r\ncompliment to several other ladies. The physical exertion of dancing,\r\njoined to the excitement of the occasion and following a dreary\r\nwinter-day’s journey, was too much for the enfeebled constitution of\r\na man of sixty years. He fainted in the ballroom, was carried to his\r\nchamber and died next day.\r\n\r\nAPPOINTMENTS IN THE ELECTORAL CHAPEL\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been the etiquette, that when an elector breathed\r\nhis last, the musical chapel expired with him. At all events, no\r\nother explanation appears of the fact that so many of the petitions\r\nfor membership, which are still preserved, should be signed by men\r\nwho had already been named in the Court Calendars. It is also to be\r\nremarked that some of the petitioners receive appointments “without\r\nsalary.” These seem to have been appointments of the kind, which in\r\nlater years were distinguished in the records and in the calendars by\r\nthe term “accessist,” and which, according to the best lights afforded\r\nby the archives, may be considered as having been provisional, until\r\nthe incumbent had proved his skill and capacity, or until a vacancy\r\noccurred through the death or resignation of some old member. There\r\nare indications that the “accessists,” though without fixed salary,\r\nreceived some small remuneration for their services; but this is by no\r\nmeans certain. It would seem that both vocalists and instrumentists\r\nwho received salaries out of the state revenues were limited to a\r\nfixed number; that the amount of funds devoted to this object was\r\nalso strictly limited and the costs incurred by the engagement of\r\nsuperior artists with extra salaries, or by an increase of the number,\r\nwere defrayed from the Elector’s privy purse; that the position\r\nof “accessist” was sought by young musicians as a stepping-stone\r\nto some future vacancy which, when acquired, insured a gradually\r\nincreasing income during the years of service and a small pension when\r\nsuperannuated; that the etiquette of the court demanded, even in cases\r\nwhen the Elector expressly called some distinguished artist to Bonn,\r\nthat the appointment should be apparently only in gracious answer to\r\nan humble petition, and that, with few exceptions, both singers and\r\nmembers of the orchestra were employed in the church, the theatre and\r\nthe concert-room.\r\n\r\nClemens August made his formal entry into Bonn, May 15, 1724. A number\r\nof petitions are passed over, but one granted “without salary” on\r\nFebruary 18, 1727, from Van den Eeden must be given in its entirety:\r\n\r\n    Supplique tres humble a S. A. S. E. de Cologne\r\n    pour Gille Vandeneet.\r\n    BONN, d. 18 Feb., 1727.\r\n\r\n    Prince Serenissime,\r\n    Monsigneur.\r\n\r\n     Vandeneet vient avec tout le respect qui luy est possible se\r\n     mettre aux pieds de V. A. S. E. luy representer qu’ayant eu\r\n     l’honneur d’avoir estre second organiste de feu S. A. S. E.\r\n     d’heureuse memoire, elle daigne luy vouloir faire la même grace\r\n     ne demendant aucun gage si long tems qu’il plaira a V. A. S. E.\r\n     promettant la servire avec soin et diligence.\r\n\r\n    Quoi faisant etc. etc.\r\n\r\nOn the same date Van den Eeden received his appointment as second court\r\norganist. June 8, 1728, a decree is issued granting him a salary of 100\r\nflorins. To a third petition the next year, signed Van den Enden, the\r\nanswer is an increase of his salary to 200 thalers, and thus a future\r\ninstructor of Ludwig van Beethoven becomes established in Bonn. The\r\nrecords need not concern us now until we reach the following, which\r\nforms part of the history of the grandfather of the subject of this\r\nbiography:\r\n\r\n     March, 1733,\r\n\r\n     _DECRETUM_ For Ludovicum van Beethoven as Electoral Court Musician.\r\n\r\n     Cl. A. Whereas His Serene Highness Elector of Cologne, Duke\r\n     Clemens August in Upper and Lower Bavaria, etc. Our Gracious\r\n     Lord having, on the humble petition of Ludovico van Beethoven,\r\n     graciously declared and received him as Court Musician, and\r\n     assigned him an annual salary of 400 florins Rhenish, the present\r\n     decree under the gracious hand of His Serene Electoral Highness\r\n     and the seal of the Privy Chancellor, is granted to him, and the\r\n     Electoral Councillor and Paymaster Risack is herewith commanded\r\n     to pay the said Beethoven the 400 fl. _quartaliter_ from the\r\n     beginning of this year and to make a proper accounting thereof.\r\n     B... March, 1733.\r\n\r\nThirteen years later we find this:\r\n\r\n     Allowance of an additional 100 Thalers annually to the Chamber\r\n     Musician van Beethoven.\r\n\r\n     Inasmuch as His Serene Highness Elector of Cologne, Duke Clement\r\n     August of Upper and Lower Bavaria, our most Gracious Lord has\r\n     increased the salary of his Chamber Musician van Beethoven by\r\n     the addition of 100 thalers annually which became due through\r\n     the death of Joseph Kayser, instrument maker, the Court Chamber\r\n     Councillor and Paymaster Risach is hereby informed and graciously\r\n     commanded to pay to him the said Beethoven the 100 fl. a year in\r\n     quarterly installments against voucher from the proper time and to\r\n     make the proper accounting. Witness, etc. Poppelsdorf, August 22,\r\n     1746.\r\n\r\nOn May 2, 1747, Johann Ries became Court Trumpeter with a salary of\r\n192 thalers. This is the first representative we have met of a name\r\nwhich afterwards rose to great distinction, not only in the orchestra\r\nof the Elector but also in the world at large. On March 5, 1754, he\r\nwas formally appointed Court Musician (violinist) having set forth in\r\nhis petition that instead of confining himself to the trumpet he had\r\nmade himself serviceable in the chapel by singing and playing other\r\ninstruments. Later he took ill and was sent to Cologne. We shall\r\npresently meet his two daughters and his son Franz Ries, the last of\r\nwhom will figure prominently in the life-history of Beethoven. Under\r\ndate March 27, 1756, occur several papers which have a double interest.\r\nThey relate to the Beethoven family and are so complete as to exhibit\r\nthe entire process of appointment to membership in the electoral\r\nchapel. The original documents are not calculated to give the reader\r\na very exalted idea of the orthographical knowledge of the petitioner\r\nor the Chamber Music Director Gottwaldt; but that fault gives us the\r\nclue to the correct pronunciation of the name Beethoven--the English\r\n“Beet-garden.”\r\n\r\nJOHANN VAN BEETHOVEN BECOMES “ACCESSIST”\r\n\r\n    To His Electoral Serenity of Cologne, etc. My most Gracious Lord\r\n    the humble petition and prayer of\r\n    Joan van Biethoffen.\r\n\r\n    Most Reverend, most Serene Elector,\r\n    Most Gracious Lord, Lord, etc.\r\n\r\n     May it please your Electoral Serenity graciously to hear the\r\n     humble representations how in the absence of voices in Your\r\n     Highness’s Court Chapel my insignificant self took part in the\r\n     music for at least four years without the good fortune of having\r\n     allotted by Your Serene Electoral Highness a small _salario_.\r\n\r\n     I therefore pray Your Serene Electoral Highness most humbly that\r\n     it graciously please you (in consideration of my father’s faithful\r\n     service for 23 years) to rejoice me with a decree as court\r\n     musician, which high grace will infuse me with zeal to serve Your\r\n     Serene Highness with the greatest fidelity and zealousness.\r\n\r\n    Your\r\n    Serene Electoral Highness’s\r\n    Most humble-obedient-faithful servant,\r\n    Joan van Biethoffen.\r\n\r\n     To the Music Director Gottwaldt for a report of his humble\r\n     judgment. Attestation by the most gracious sign manual and seal of\r\n     the privy chancellary.\r\n\r\n    Bonn, March 19, 1756.\r\n    (Signed) Clemens August (L.S.)\r\n\r\n    Most reverend, most serene Elector,\r\n    Most gracious Lord, Lord, etc.\r\n\r\n     Your Serene Electoral Highness has referred to my humble judgment\r\n     the petition of Joan van Piethoffen, the supplicant prays Your\r\n     Electoral Highness for a gracious decree as accessist in the\r\n     court music, he has indeed served for two years with his voice on\r\n     the Duc Sall (doxal), hopes in time to deserve the good will of\r\n     Your Serene Highness by his industry, and his father who enjoys\r\n     the grace of serving Your Highness as bass singer prays his\r\n     appointment, I pray most humbly and obediently for instruction\r\n     concerning your Highness’s good will in the matter, submit myself\r\n     humbly and obediently to Your Serene Highness’s grace and remain\r\n     in greatest humility.\r\n\r\n    Your Serene and Electoral Highness’s\r\n    Most Humble and obedient servant\r\n    Gottwaldt, Director of the\r\n    Chamber Music.\r\n\r\nA further report was made to the Elector as follows:\r\n\r\n    BONN, March 27, 1756.\r\n    _Coloniensis gratiosa._\r\n\r\n     Chamber Music Director Gottwaldt _ad supplicam_ of Joan van\r\n     Betthoffen has served two years on the docsal and hopes through\r\n     his industry to serve further to the satisfaction of Your\r\n     Electoral Highness, to which end his father who through Your\r\n     Highness’s grace serves as bass singer will seek completely to\r\n     qualify him which may it please Your Serene Highness to allow.\r\n\r\n     _Idem_ Gottwaldt _ad supplicam_ Ernest Haveckas, accessist in the\r\n     court music, reports that suppliant, though not fully capable\r\n     as yet hopes by special diligence to make himself worthy of\r\n     Your Highness’s service and would be encouraged and rejoiced in\r\n     his efforts if Your Serene Highness would graciously deign to\r\n     grant him a _decreto_, humbly praying to be informed as to Your\r\n     Highness’s wishes in the matter.\r\n\r\n     _DECRETUM_\r\n\r\n     Court Musician’s Decree for Johan van Biethofen.\r\n\r\n     _Clm.

Why he should\r\nappear in the Court Calendar as an _accessist_ four years after the\r\npublication of this decree appointing him Court Musician does not\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nTHE DUTIES OF COURT CHAPELMASTERS\r\n\r\nBut slender success has rewarded the search for means of determining\r\nthe character and quality of that opera and music, upon which,\r\naccording to Ennen, Clemens August lavished such large sums. The period\r\nembraced in that elector’s rule (1724-1761) was precisely that in which\r\nthe _old_ Italian opera, the oratorio and the sacred cantata reached\r\ntheir extreme limits of development through the genius of Handel and\r\nJ. S. Bach. It closes at the moment when Gluck, C. P. E. Bach and\r\nJoseph Haydn were laying the immovable foundations of a new operatic,\r\norchestral and pianoforte music, and before the perfected sonata-form,\r\nthat found universal adoption in all compositions of the better class,\r\nnot vocal. Little music comparatively was issued from the press in\r\nthose days, and consequently new forms and new styles made their way\r\nslowly into vogue. Another consequence was that the offices of composer\r\nfor the chamber, the church, the comedy, or however they were named,\r\nwere by no means sinecures--neither at the imperial court of Maria\r\nTheresia, nor at the court of any petty prince or noble whose servants\r\nformed his orchestra. Composers had to furnish music on demand and as\r\noften as was necessary, as the hunter delivered game or the fisherman\r\nfish. What a volume of music was produced in this manner can be seen\r\nin the case of Joseph Haydn at Esterhaz, whose fruitfulness did not,\r\nin all probability, exceed that of many another of his contemporaries.\r\nThe older Telemann furnished compositions to the courts of Bayreuth\r\nand Eisenach as well as the Gray Friars at Frankfort-on-the-Main, and\r\nalso performed his duties as musical director and composer at Hamburg.\r\nHe wrote music with such ease that, as Handel said, he could write\r\nfor eight voices as rapidly as an ordinary man could write a letter.\r\nUnder such conditions did the men write who are mentioned as official\r\ncomposers in our narrative. It is probable that not a note of theirs\r\nremains in existence, and equally probable that the loss is not at\r\nall deplorable except as it leaves the curiosity of an antiquary\r\nunsatisfied. A few text-books to vocal pieces performed on various\r\noccasions during this reign have been preserved, their titles being\r\n“Componimento per Musica,” music by Giuseppe dall’Abaco, Director of\r\nthe Chamber Music (1740); “La Morte d’Abel” (no date is given, but\r\n“il Signor Biethoven” sang the part of _Adamo_); “Esther” (“From the\r\nItalian of S. F. A. Aubert,” the text partly in German, partly in\r\nItalian); “Anagilda” (_Drama per Musica_).\r\n\r\nAfter the unlucky ball at Ehrenbreitstein the crook and sceptre\r\nof Cologne passed from the Bavarian family which had so long held\r\nthem into the hands of Maximilian Friedrich of the Suabian line\r\nKönigsegg- (or Königseck-) Rothenfels. For a century or more this\r\nhouse had enjoyed fat livings in the church at Cologne, in which\r\ncity the new elector was born on May 13, 1708. He was the fourth of\r\nhis race who had held the important office of Dean of the Cathedral,\r\nfrom which post he was elevated to the electorship on April 6, 1761,\r\nand to the ecclesiastical principality of Münster the next year;\r\nwith which two sees he was fain to be content. He was by nature an\r\neasy, good-tempered, indolent, friendly man, of no great force of\r\ncharacter--qualities which in the incumbent of a rich sinecure just\r\ncompleting his fifty-third year, would be too fully confirmed and\r\ndeveloped by habit to change with any change of circumstances; and\r\nwhich, says Stramberg, made him unusually popular throughout the land\r\ndespite the familiar little verse:\r\n\r\n    Bei Clemens August trug man blau und weiss,\r\n    Da lebte man wie im Paradeis;\r\n    Bei Max Friedrich trug man sich schwarz und roth,\r\n    Da litt man Hunger wie die schwere Noth.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the finances had become such through the extravagant\r\nexpenditures of Clemens August that very energetic measures were\r\nnecessary, and to the effects of these, during the first few years of\r\nMax Friedrich’s rule, in throwing many persons out of employment, these\r\ndoggerel lines doubtless owe their origin.\r\n\r\nMAX FRIEDRICH AND HIS MINISTER\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for the Elector’s subjects that his indolence was\r\nmade good by the activity and energy of a prime minister who found\r\nhis beau ideal of a statesman in Frederick II of Prussia, whom, in\r\nhis domestic policy, he imitated as far as the character of the\r\ntwo governments allowed. This was equally if not more true in the\r\nprincipality of Münster. To the respect which one must feel for the\r\nmemory of Belderbusch, the all-powerful minister at Bonn, is added,\r\nin the case of Fürstenberg, the equally powerful minister at Münster,\r\nadmiration and regard for the man. The former was respected, feared,\r\nbut not loved in the electorate; the latter was respected and very\r\npopular in the principality. To Kasper Anton von Belderbusch the new\r\nElector owed his elevation; to his care he entrusted the state; to\r\nhis skill and strength of character he was indebted for release from\r\nthe pecuniary difficulties which beset him and for the satisfaction,\r\nas the years rolled by, of seeing his states numbered among the most\r\nprosperous and flourishing in Germany. Belderbusch’s first care was\r\nto reduce the expenditure. “He put a stop to building,” says Ennen,\r\n“dismissed a number of the actors, restricted the number of concerts\r\nand court balls, dispensed with the costly hunts, reduced the salaries\r\nof court officials, officers and domestics, lessened the _état_ for the\r\nkitchen, cellar and table of the prince, turned the property left by\r\nClemens August into money and comforted the latter’s creditors with the\r\nhope of better times.” But though economy was the rule, still, where\r\nthe Elector considered it due to his position, he could be lavish.\r\nWhatever opinions may be entertained as to the wisdom and expediency of\r\nclothing ecclesiastics with civil power, it would be unjust not to give\r\nthe bright as well as the dark side of the picture. This is well put\r\nby Kaspar Risbeck in relation to the Rhenish states whose princes were\r\nchurchmen, and his remarks are in place here, since they relate in part\r\nto that in which the childhood and youth of Beethoven were spent.\r\n\r\n     The whole stretch of the country from here to Mayence is one of\r\n     the richest and most populous in Germany. Within this territory\r\n     of 18 German miles there are 20 cities lying hard by the shore of\r\n     the Rhine and dating, for the greater part, from the period of\r\n     the Romans. It is still plainly to be seen that this portion of\r\n     Germany was the first to be built up. Neither morasses nor heaths\r\n     interrupt the evidences of cultivation which stretch with equal\r\n     industry far from the shores of the river over the contiguous\r\n     country. While many cities and castles built under Charlemagne\r\n     and his successors, especially Henry I, in other parts of Germany\r\n     have fallen into decay, all in this section have not only been\r\n     preserved but many have been added to them.... The natural wealth\r\n     of the soil in comparison with that of other lands, and the easy\r\n     disposition of its products by means of the Rhine, have no doubt\r\n     contributed most to these results. Nevertheless, great as is the\r\n     prejudice in Germany against the ecclesiastical governments, they\r\n     have beyond doubt aided in the blooming development of these\r\n     regions. In the three ecclesiastical electorates which make up\r\n     the greater part of this tract of land nothing is known of those\r\n     tax burdens under which the subjects of so many secular princes\r\n     of Germany groan. These princes have exceeded the old assessments\r\n     but slightly. Little is known in their countries of serfdom. The\r\n     appanage of many princes and princesses do not force them to\r\n     extortion. They have no inordinate military institution, and do\r\n     not sell the sons of their farmers; and they have never taken so\r\n     active a part in the domestic and foreign wars of Germany as the\r\n     secular princes. Though they are not adept in encouraging their\r\n     subjects in art culture, varied agriculture has been developed to\r\n     a high degree of perfection throughout the region. Nature does of\r\n     its own accord what laws and regulations seek to compel, as soon\r\n     as the rocks of offence are removed from the path.[1]\r\n\r\nHenry Swinburne, whose letters to his brother were published long after\r\nhis death under the title of “The Courts of Europe,” writes under date\r\nof November 29, 1780:\r\n\r\n     Bonn is a pretty town, neatly built, and its streets tolerably\r\n     well paved, all in black lava. It is situated in a flat near the\r\n     river. The Elector of Cologne’s palace faces the South entry. It\r\n     has no beauty of architecture and is all plain white without any\r\n     pretensions.\r\n\r\n     We went to court and were invited to dine with the Elector\r\n     (Königsegge). He is 73 years old, a little, hale, black man, very\r\n     merry and affable. His table is none of the best; no dessert\r\n     wines handed about, nor any foreign wines at all. He is easy and\r\n     agreeable, having lived all his life in ladies’ company, which he\r\n     is said to have liked better than his breviary. The captains of\r\n     his guard and a few other people of the court form the company,\r\n     amongst whom were his two great-nieces, Madame de Hatzfeld and\r\n     Madame de Taxis. The palace is of immense size, the ball-room\r\n     particularly large and low.... The Elector goes about to all the\r\n     assemblies and plays at Tric-trac. He asked me to be of his party\r\n     but I was not acquainted with their way of playing. There is every\r\n     evening an assembly or play at court. The Elector seems very\r\n     strong and healthy, and will, I think, hold the Archduke a good\r\n     tug yet.\r\n\r\nThis Archduke was Max Franz, youngest son of Maria Theresia, whose\r\nacquaintance Swinburne had made in Vienna, and who had just been chosen\r\ncoadjutor to Max Friedrich. A curious proof of the liberality, not to\r\nsay laxity, of the Elector’s sentiments in one direction is given by\r\nStramberg in his “Rheinischer Antiquarius,” to wit, the possession of\r\na mistress in common by him and his minister Belderbusch--the latter\r\nfathering the children--and this mistress was the Countess Caroline von\r\nSatzenhofen, Abbess of Vilich!\r\n\r\nCHAPELMASTER LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN\r\n\r\nThe reduction which was made by Belderbusch upon the accession of Max\r\nFriedrich in the expenses of the theatre and other amusements does not\r\nappear, except in the case of the chapelmaster, to have extended to the\r\ncourt music proper, nor to have been long continued in respect to the\r\n“operetta and comedy.” The first in order of the documents and notices\r\ndiscovered relating to the musical establishment of this Elector are of\r\nno common interest, being the petition of a candidate for the vacant\r\noffice of chapelmaster and the decree appointing him to that position.\r\nThey are as follows:\r\n\r\n    Very Reverend Archbishop and Elector\r\n    most gracious Lord Lord!\r\n\r\n     May it please Your Electoral Grace to permit a representation of\r\n     my faithfully and dutifully performed services for a considerable\r\n     space as vocalist as well as, since the death of the chapelmaster,\r\n     for more than a year his duties _in Dupplo_, that is to say by\r\n     singing and wielding the baton concerning which my demand still\r\n     remains _ad referendum_ much less have I been assured of the\r\n     position. Inasmuch as because of particular _recommendation_\r\n     Dousmoulin was preferred over me, and indeed unjustly, I have been\r\n     forced hitherto to submit to fate.\r\n\r\n     But now, gracious Elector and Lord, that because of the reduction\r\n     in salaries Chapelmaster Dousmoulin has already asked his\r\n     demission or will soon do so, and I at the command of Baron\r\n     Belderbusch am to begin _de novo_ to fill his office, and the same\r\n     must surely be replaced,--Therefore\r\n\r\n     There reaches Your Electoral Grace my humble petition that you\r\n     may graciously be pleased (: inasmuch as the “Toxal” must be\r\n     sufficiently supplied with _musique_, and I must at all events\r\n     take the lead in the occurring church ceremonies _in puncto_ the\r\n     chorales:) to grant me the justice of which I was deprived on the\r\n     death of Your Highness’s _antecessori_ of blessed memory, and\r\n     appoint me chapelmaster with some augmentation of my lessened\r\n     salary because of my services performed in _Duplo_. For which\r\n     highest grace I shall pour out my prayers to God for the long\r\n     continuing health and government of your Electoral Grace, while in\r\n     deepest submission I throw myself at your feet.\r\n\r\n    Your\r\n    Electoral Grace’s\r\n    most humble servant\r\n    Ludwig van Beethoven\r\n    “Passist.”\r\n\r\n     M. F. Whereas We, Maximilian Friedrich, Elector of Cologne, on the\r\n     demission of our former chapelmaster Touche Moulin, and the humble\r\n     petition of our bass singer Ludwig van Beethoven have appointed\r\n     the latter to be chapelmaster with the retention of his position\r\n     as bass singer, and have added 97 rthlr. _species_ 40 alb. to his\r\n     former salary of 292 rthlr. _species_ 40 alb. per annum divided\r\n     in _quartalien_, which appointment is hereby made and payment\r\n     ordered by our grace, our exchequer and all whom it may concern\r\n     are called on to observe the fact and do what is required under\r\n     the circumstances.\r\n\r\n     Attest, etc.\r\n\r\n    Bonn, July 16, 1761.\r\n\r\nNext in order, at an interval of rather more than a year, is the\r\nfollowing short paper in reply to a petition, not preserved, of the new\r\nchapelmaster’s son:\r\n\r\n     _Supplicanten_ is hereby graciously assured that in the event of\r\n     a _vacatur_ of a court musician’s salary he shall have special\r\n     consideration.

Münster, August 8, 1764.\r\n    Sent, the 22 _dito_.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this order on July 1, 1765, the Elector gave a document\r\nto the son, Johann Peter Salomon, certifying that he had served\r\nhim faithfully and diligently and had “so conducted himself as to\r\ndeserve to be recommended to every one according to his station.”[2]\r\nOn petition of Philipp Salomon, the father, he and his daughter were\r\nappointed Court Musicians by decree dated August 11, 1764.\r\n\r\nSeveral papers, dated April 26, 1768, although upon matters of very\r\nsmall importance, have a certain interest as being in part official\r\ncommunications from the pen of Chapelmaster van Beethoven, and\r\nillustrating in some measure his position and duties. They show,\r\ntoo, that his path was not always one bordered with roses. Being\r\nself-explanatory they require no comment:\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n    Most Reverend Archbishop and Elector,\r\n    Most Gracious Lord, Lord.\r\n\r\n     Will Your Electoral Grace deign to listen to the complaint that\r\n     when Court Singer Schwachhofer was commanded in obedience to an\r\n     order of His Excellency Baron von Belderbusch to alternate with\r\n     Jacobina Salomon in the singing of the solos in the church music\r\n     as is the custom, the said Schwachhofer in the presence of the\r\n     entire chapel impertinently and literally answered me as follows:\r\n     I will not accept your _ordre_ and you have no right to command me.\r\n\r\n     Your Electoral Grace will doubtless recall various _disordre_\r\n     on the part of the court chapel indicating that all respect and\r\n     _ordonance_ is withheld from me, each member behaving as he sees\r\n     fit, which is very painful to my sensibilities.\r\n\r\n     Wherefore my humble prayer reaches Your Electoral Highness that\r\n     the public affront of the Schwachhofer be punished to my deserved\r\n     _satisfaction_ and that a decree issue from Your Highness to the\r\n     entire chapel that at the cost of Your Gracious displeasure or\r\n     punishment according to the offence my _ordre_ shall not be evaded.\r\n\r\n    Your Electoral Grace’s\r\n    Humble and Most Obedient Servant\r\n    Ludovicus van Beethoven.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n    To Chapelmaster van Beethoven\r\n    Concerning the Court Musicians.\r\n    M.

Bonn, April 26, 1768.\r\n\r\nJOHANN VAN BEETHOVEN NEEDS MORE MONEY\r\n\r\nOn November 17, 1769, Johann van Beethoven submits a petition in\r\nwhich he exhibits anew his genius for devising methods for varying\r\nthe spelling of his own name. That he could no longer live on 100 th.\r\nsalary is evident when it is remembered that he has now been married\r\ntwo years; but as there were several applicants for the salary which\r\nhad fallen to the disposal of the Elector, it was divided among the\r\nfour most needy. Beethoven’s memorial contains a fact or two in regard\r\nto his duties as Court Musician which are new:\r\n\r\n    To\r\n    His Electoral Grace\r\n    of Cologne, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n    The Humble Supplication\r\n    and Prayer\r\n    of\r\n    Johann Bethof, Court Musician.\r\n\r\n    Most Reverend Archbishop and Elector,\r\n    Most Gracious Lord, Lord.\r\n\r\n     May Your Most Reverend Electoral Grace, graciously permit the\r\n     presentation of this humble _supplicando_, how for many years I\r\n     have served Your Highness faithfully and industriously on the\r\n     “Duc saahl” and the theatre, and also have given instruction in\r\n     various _supjecta_ concerning the aforesaid service to the entire\r\n     satisfaction of Your Electoral Grace, and am engaged now in study\r\n     to perfect myself to this end.\r\n\r\n     My father also joins in this _supplic_ in his humble capacity of\r\n     the _theatri_ and will participate in the gladness should Your\r\n     Electoral Grace graciously grant the favor; as it is impossible\r\n     for me to live on the salary of 100 th. graciously allowed me, I\r\n     pray Your Electoral Grace to bestow upon me the 100 th. left at\r\n     Your gracious disposal by the death of Your court musician Philip\r\n     Haveck; to merit this high grace by faithful and diligent service\r\n     shall be my greatest striving.\r\n\r\n    Your Electoral Grace’s\r\n    most humble\r\n    Joannes Bethof,\r\n    Court Musician.\r\n\r\nIn answer to this there came the following decree:\r\n\r\n     Whereas we, Max. Frid. p. on the death of Court Musician Philipp\r\n     Haveck and the submissive petition of our court musician Philipp\r\n     Salomon bestowed upon him the grace of adding 50 fl. for his\r\n     two daughters to the salary which he already enjoys out of the\r\n     salary of the above mentioned Haveck per year; we confirm the act\r\n     hereby; wherefore we have graciously issued, this decree, which\r\n     our Electoral Court Exchequer will humbly observe and make all\r\n     necessary provisions.\r\n\r\n    Attest, p. Münster, 17th 9bris 1769.\r\n\r\n     (On the margin:) “Gracious addition of 50 fl. for the court\r\n     musician Philipp Salomon” and, besides Brandt and Meuris, also\r\n     “_in simili_ for Court Musician Joann Bethoff 25 fl.”\r\n\r\nThere need be no apology for filling a few more pages with extracts\r\nfrom documents found in the Düsseldorf archives; for now a period has\r\nbeen reached in which the child Ludwig van Beethoven is growing up\r\ninto youth and early manhood, and thrown into constant contact with\r\nthose whose names will appear. Some of these names will come up many\r\nyears later in Vienna; others will have their parts to play in the\r\nnarrative of that child’s life. Omitting, for the present, a petition\r\nof Johann van Beethoven, we begin them with that of Joseph Demmer, of\r\ndate January 23, 1773, which first secured him his appointment after a\r\nyear’s service and three months’ instruction from “the young Mr. van\r\nBeethoven.”\r\n\r\n    Most Reverend Archbishop and Elector,\r\n    Most Gracious Lord, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n     I have been accepted as chorister in the cathedral of this city at\r\n     a salary of 80 th. per year, and have so practised myself in music\r\n     that I humbly flatter myself of my ability to perform my task\r\n     with the highest satisfaction.\r\n\r\n     It being graciously known that the bass singer van Beethoven\r\n     is incapacitated and can no longer serve as such, and the\r\n     contra-bassist Noisten can not adapt his voice: therefore this my\r\n     submissive to Your Reverend Electoral Grace that you graciously\r\n     be pleased to accept me as your bass singer with such gracious\r\n     salary as may seem fit; I offer should it be demanded to attend\r\n     the operettas also and qualify myself in a short time. It depends\r\n     upon a mere hint from Your Electoral Grace alone; that it shall\r\n     not be burdensome to the cantor’s office of the cathedral to save\r\n     the loss of the 80 th. yearly which it has bestowed upon me.\r\n\r\n    I am in most dutiful reverence\r\n    Your Electoral Grace’s\r\n    most obedient\r\n    Joseph Demmer.\r\n\r\n    _Pro Memoria_.\r\n\r\n     Cantor Demmer earned at the utmost 106 rth. per year if he\r\n     neglected none of the greater or little _Horis_.\r\n\r\n    Pays the Chamber Chancellor Kügelgen\r\n        for board, annually, 66 rth.\r\n        for _quartier_ (lodging) 12 rth.\r\n\r\n     moreover, he must find himself in clothes and washing since his\r\n     father, the sub-sacristan in Cologne, is still overburdened with 6\r\n     children.\r\n\r\n     He has paid 6 rth. to young Mr. Beethoven for 3 months.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH DEMMER SUCCEEDS BEETHOVEN\r\n\r\nIn response to another petition after the death of L. van Beethoven the\r\nfollowing decree was issued:\r\n\r\n    Decree as Court vocal bass for Joseph Demmer.\r\n\r\n     Whereas His Electoral Grace of Cologne, M. F. our most gracious\r\n     Lord, on the humble petition of Joseph Demmer has graciously\r\n     appointed and accepted him as His Highness’s vocal bass on the\r\n     Electoral Toxal, with a yearly salary of 200 fl. divided in\r\n     _quartalien_ to begin with the current time, the appointment is\r\n     confirmed hereby and a decree granted to the same Demmer, of\r\n     which, for purposes of payment, the Electoral Chancellary will\r\n     take notice and all whom it may concern will respect and obey the\r\n     same and otherwise do what is necessary in the premises. Attest,\r\n     p. Bonn, May 29, 1774.\r\n\r\nTwo years later leave of absence, but without salary, was granted to\r\nJoseph Demmer to visit Amsterdam to complete his education in music.\r\nFurther notes from documentary sources:\r\n\r\n     1774. May 26. Andreas Lucchesi appointed Court Chapelmaster in\r\n     place of Ludwig van Beethoven, deceased, with a salary of 1,000 fl.\r\n\r\n     May 29. Salary of Anna Maria Ries raised from 230 fl. to 300\r\n     fl. On May 13, 1775, together with Ferdinand Trewer (Drewer),\r\n     violinist, she receives leave of absence for four months, to\r\n     begin in June with two quarters’ pay in advance. In the Court\r\n     Calendar for 1775, which was printed about seven months in\r\n     advance, she is already described as Madame Drewers, née Ries. She\r\n     was considered the best singer in the chapel.\r\n\r\n     November 23. Franz Anton Ries has granted him 25 th. payable\r\n     quarterly.\r\n\r\n     1775. March 23. Nicolas Simrock appointed on petition “Court\r\n     Hornist on the Electoral Toxal, in the cabinet and at table,”\r\n     and a salary of 300 fl. was granted April 1. This is the first\r\n     appearance in these records of a name which afterwards rose into\r\n     prominence.\r\n\r\n     1777. April 20. B. J. Mäurer, violoncellist, “who has served in\r\n     the court chapel from the beginning of the year till now on a\r\n     promise of 100 th.,” prays for an appointment as court ’cellist\r\n     at a salary of 400 th. Appointed at a salary of 200 th.; we shall\r\n     have occasion to recur to him presently in connection with notices\r\n     touching Beethoven.\r\n\r\nUnder date May 22, 1778, J. van Beethoven informs the Elector that\r\n“the singer Averdonck, who is to be sent to Chapelmaster Sales at\r\nCoblenz, is to pay 15 fl. per month for board and lodging but that\r\nonly a _douceur_ is to be asked for her instruction and that to take\r\nher thither will cost 20 th.” There followed upon this the following\r\ndocument:\r\n\r\n    To the humble announcement of Court Musician Beethoven\r\n    touching the singer Averdonck.\r\n\r\n     Electoral Councillor Forlivesi is to pay to the proper authorities\r\n     for a year beginning next month, 15 fl. a month and for the\r\n     travelling expenses 20 rth. once and for all as soon as the\r\n     journey is begun.\r\n\r\n    Attest.\r\n    p. Bonn, May 22, 1778.\r\n\r\nThis pupil of Johann van Beethoven, Johanna Helena Averdonk, born in\r\nBonn on December 11, 1760, and brought forward by her teacher at a\r\nconcert in Cologne, received 120 th. “as a special grace” on July 2,\r\nand was appointed Court Singer on November 18, 1780, with a salary of\r\n200 th. She died nine years later, August 13, 1789.\r\n\r\nThe petitions sent in to the Elector were rarely dated and were not\r\nalways immediately attended to; therefore the date of a _decretum_ is\r\nnot to be taken as conclusive in regard to the date of facts mentioned\r\nin a petition. An illustration is afforded by a petition of Franz\r\nRies. He has returned from a tour to Vienna and prays for a salary of\r\n500 fl. “not the half of what he can earn elsewhere.” The petition is\r\ndated March 2. Two months passing without bringing him an answer, he\r\npetitions again and obtains a decree on May 2 that in addition to his\r\nsalary of 28 th. 2 alb. 6, he shall receive “annoch so viel,”--again as\r\nmuch,--i. e., 400 fl.\r\n\r\n     1780. August. Court Organist Van den Eede prays that in\r\n     consideration of his service of 54 years he be graciously and\r\n     charitably given the salary vacated by the death of Court Musician\r\n     Salomon. Eighteen others make the same prayer. The decision of the\r\n     privy council is in these words: “To be divided between Huttenus\r\n     and Esch. A decree as musical vocalist must first be given to the\r\n     latter.”\r\n\r\n     1781. February 15. The name of C. G. Neefe is now met with for\r\n     the first time. He petitions for appointment to the position of\r\n     organist in succession to Van den Eede, obviously aged and infirm.\r\n     A decree was issued “_placet et expediatur_ on the death of\r\n     Organist Van den Eede,” and a salary of 400 fl. granted.\r\n\r\n     1782. May 16. Johann van Beethoven petitions for “the three\r\n     measures (_Malter_) of corn.”\r\n\r\nThe archives of Düsseldorf furnish little more during the time of Max\r\nFrederick save certain papers relating to the Beethoven family, which\r\nare reserved for another place.\r\n\r\nOPERA AT THE ELECTOR’S COURT\r\n\r\nThe search for means to form some correct idea of the character of\r\nthe musical performances at the Elector’s court during this reign\r\nhas been more successful than for the preceding; but much is left to\r\nbe desired down to the year 1778, when the theatre was placed upon a\r\ndifferent basis and its history is sufficiently recorded. Such notices,\r\nhowever, in relation to the operatic entertainments as have been found\r\nscattered, mostly in the newspapers of Bonn, in those years, are\r\nnumerous enough to give an idea of their character; while the remarks\r\nupon the festivities of the court, connected with them, afford a pretty\r\nlively picture of social amusement in the highest circle. We make room\r\nfor some of the most significant occurrences, in chronological order:\r\n\r\n     1764. January 3. Galuppi’s opera “Il Filosofo di Campagna,” given\r\n     in the Electoral Theatre with great applause.\r\n\r\n     January 8. A grand assembly at the palace in the afternoon, a\r\n     magnificent supper in the grand gallery at which many spectators\r\n     were present, and finally a masked ball.\r\n\r\n     March 23. Second performance of “La buona Figliuola,” music by\r\n     Piccini.\r\n\r\n     May 13. Elector’s birthday; “Le Nozze,” music by Galuppi, and two\r\n     ballets.\r\n\r\n     May 20. “II Filosofo” again, the notice of which is followed by\r\n     the remark that the Elector is about removing to Brühl for the\r\n     summer but will visit Bonn twice a week “on the days when operas\r\n     are performed.”\r\n\r\n     September 21. “La Pastorella al Soglio” (composer not named,\r\n     probably Latilla), and two ballets.\r\n\r\n     December 16. “La Calamità di cuori,” by Galuppi, and two ballets.\r\n     This was “the first performance by the Mingotti company under the\r\n     direction of Rizzi and Romanini.”\r\n\r\n     1765. January 6. “Le Aventure di Rodolfo” (Piccini?), given by the\r\n     same company together with a pantomime, “L’Arlequino fortunato per\r\n     la Maggia.” After the play there was a grand supper at which the\r\n     Pope’s nuncio was a guest, and finally a masked ball kept up till\r\n     6 o’clock in the morning.\r\n\r\n     1767. May 13. The Archbishop’s birthday. Here is the programme\r\n     condensed from the long description of the festivities in the\r\n     “Bonnischer Anzeiger”: 1, Early in the morning three rounds from\r\n     the cannon on the city walls; 2, The court and public graciously\r\n     permitted to kiss His Transparency’s hand; 3, solemn high mass\r\n     with salvos of artillery; 4, Grand dinner in public, the pope’s\r\n     nuncio, the foreign ministers and the nobility being the guests\r\n     and the eating being accompanied by “exquisite table-music”; 5,\r\n     After dinner “a numerously attended assembly”; 6, “A serenata\r\n     composed especially for this most joyful day” and a comic\r\n     opera in the palace theatre; 7, Supper of 130 covers; 8, _Bal\r\n     masqué_ until 5 a. m. The two dramatic pieces were “Serenata\r\n     festivale, tra Bacco, Diana ed il Reno,” the authors unnamed,\r\n     and “Schiava finta,” _drama giocoso dal celebre don Francesco\r\n     Garzia_, _Spagnuolo_, the music probably by Piccini; “Giovanni van\r\n     Beethoven” sang the part of _Dorindo_.\r\n\r\n     1768. May 16. “On the stage of the Court Theatre was performed\r\n     with much applause a musical poem in German, specially written for\r\n     the birthday of His Highness, and afterward an Italian intermezzo\r\n     entitled ‘La Nobiltà delusa.’”\r\n\r\n     1769. The festivities in honor of the birthday of the Elector\r\n     took place May 17th, when, according to the “Anzeiger,” “an\r\n     Italian musical drama written expressly for this occasion was\r\n     performed”--but the title suggests the possibility of a mistake;\r\n     “II Riso d’Apolline,” with music by Betz, had been heard in 1701.\r\n\r\n     1771. A single discovery only for this year has rewarded search,\r\n     that of a text-book, one of particular interest: “Silvain,”\r\n     comédie en une acte, mélée d’ariettes, représentée, etc. Text\r\n     by Marmontel, music by Grétry. _Dolmon père_, Mons. Louis van\r\n     Beethoven, _Maître de Chapelle_; _Dolmon, fils ainé_, Jean van\r\n     Beethoven, etc.\r\n\r\n     1772. February 27. “Le Donne sempre Donne,” music by Andreas\r\n     Lucchesi.\r\n\r\n     In March, on occasion of the opening of the Estates, “La Contadine\r\n     in Corte,” music by Sacchini.\r\n\r\n     The pieces given on the birthday this year were “Il Natal di\r\n     Giove,” music by Lucchesi, and “La buona Figliuola,” music by\r\n     Piccini. On the 17th the latter was repeated on the arrival of the\r\n     French ambassador.\r\n\r\n     1773. May 30. The Elector’s birthday; “L’Inganno scoperto, overo\r\n     il Conte Caramella,” music by Lucchesi, in which Ludovico van\r\n     Beethoven sang the part of _Brunoro, contadino e tamburino_.\r\n\r\nVERSATILITY OF THE COURT MUSICIANS\r\n\r\nThere are three more operettas which evidently belong to the succeeding\r\nwinter when the Bonn company had the aid of two singers from the\r\nelectoral court of Trèves. Their titles are “L’Improvvisata, o sia\r\nla Galanteria disturbata,” by Lucchesi, “Li tre Amanti ridicoli,”\r\nby Galuppi, and “La Moda,” by Baroni. Ludwig van Beethoven did not\r\nsing in them. The means are still wanting to fill up the many gaps in\r\nthe annals of this period or to carry them on during the next three\r\nyears. Perhaps, however, the loss is not of much importance, for the\r\nmaterials collected are sufficient to warrant certain conclusions in\r\nregard to the general character of the court music. The musicians,\r\nboth vocal and instrumental, were employed in the church, concert-room\r\nand theatre; their number remained without material change from the\r\ndays of Christopher Petz to the close of Chapelmaster van Beethoven’s\r\nlife; places in this service were held to be a sort of heritage,\r\nand of right due to the children of old incumbents, when possessed\r\nof sufficient musical talent and knowledge; few if any names of\r\ndistinguished virtuosos are found in the lists of the members, and,\r\nin all probability, the performances never rose above the respectable\r\nmediocrity of a small band used to playing together in the light and\r\npleasing music of the day.\r\n\r\nThe dramatic performances appear to have been confined to the operetta;\r\nand the vocalists, who sang the Latin of the mass, seem to have been\r\nrequired to be equally at home in German, Italian and French in the\r\ntheatre. Two visits of the Angelo Mingotti troupe are noted; and one\r\nattempt, at least, to place the opera upon a higher basis by the\r\nengagement of Italian songstresses, was evidently made in the time of\r\nClemens August.; it may be concluded that no great improvement was\r\nmade--it is certain that no permanent one was; for in the other case\r\nthe Bonn theatrical revolution of 1778 had not been needed. This must\r\nbe noticed in detail.\r\n\r\nChronologically the following sketch belongs to the biography of Ludwig\r\nvan Beethoven, as it embraces a period which happens in his case to\r\nbe of special interest, young as he was;--the period from his 8th to\r\nhis 14th year. But the details given, though of great importance for\r\nthe light which they throw upon the musical life in which he moved\r\nand acted, would hardly be of so much interest to most readers as to\r\njustify breaking with them the course of the future narrative.\r\n\r\nIt was a period of great awakening in theatrical matters. Princes\r\nand courts were beginning everywhere in Germany to patronize the\r\ndrama of their mother tongue and the labors of Lessing, Gotter and\r\nother well-known names, in the original production of German, or in\r\nthe translation of the best English, Italian and French plays, were\r\njustifying and giving ever new impulse to the change in taste. From\r\nthe many itinerant troupes of players performing in booths, or, in the\r\nlarger cities, in the play-houses, the better class of actors were\r\nslowly finding their way into permanent companies engaged and supported\r\nby the governments. True, many of the newly established court theatres\r\nhad but a short and not always a very merry life; true, also, that\r\nthe more common plan was merely to afford aid and protection to some\r\nitinerant troupe; still the idea of a permanent national theatre on the\r\nfooting of the already long-existing court musical establishments had\r\nmade way, and had already been carried out in various places before it\r\nwas taken up by the elector at Bonn. It can hardly be supposed that the\r\nexample of the imperial court at Vienna, with the immense means at its\r\ndisposal, could exert any direct influence upon the small court at Bonn\r\nat the other extremity of Germany; but what the Duke of Gotha and the\r\nelector at Mannheim had undertaken in this direction, Max Friedrich may\r\nwell have ventured and determined to imitate. But there was an example\r\nnearer home--in fact in his own capital of Münster, where he, the\r\nprince primate, usually spent the summer. In 1775, Dobbler’s troupe,\r\nwhich had been for some time playing in that city, was broken up.\r\n\r\n     The Westhus brothers in Münster built up their own out of the\r\n     ruins; but it endured only a short time. Thereupon, under the\r\n     care of the minister, H. von Fürstenberg (one of those rare\r\n     men whom heaven elects and equips with all necessary gifts to\r\n     cultivate what is good and beautiful in the arts), a meeting of\r\n     the lovers of the stage was arranged in May and a few gentlemen\r\n     of the nobility and a few from the parterre formed a council\r\n     which assumed the direction. The Elector makes a considerable\r\n     contribution. The money otherwise received is to be applied to the\r\n     improvement of the wardrobe and the theatre. The actors receive\r\n     their honoraria every month.[3]\r\n\r\nOPERA AND DRAMA AT BONN IN 1779\r\n\r\nAt Easter, 1777, Seyler, a manager famous in German theatrical annals,\r\nand then at Dresden, finding himself unable to compete with his\r\nrival, Bondini, left that city with his company to try his fortunes\r\nin Frankfort-on-the-Main, Mayence, and other cities in that quarter.\r\nThe company was very large--the Theatre Lexicon (Article “Mainz”)\r\nmakes it, including its orchestra, amount to 230 individuals!--much\r\ntoo large, it seems, in spite of the assertion of the Theatre Lexicon,\r\nto be profitable. Be that as it may, after an experience of a year or\r\nmore, two of the leading members, Grossmann and Helmuth, accepted an\r\nengagement from Max Friedrich to form and manage a company at Bonn in\r\norder that “the German art of acting might be raised to a school of\r\nmorals and manners for his people.” Taking with them a pretty large\r\nportion of Seyler’s company, including several of the best members, the\r\nmanagers reached Bonn and were ready upon the Elector’s return from\r\nMünster to open a season. “The opening of the theatre took place,” says\r\nthe Bonn “Dramaturgische Nachrichten,” “on the 26th of November, 1778,\r\nwith a prologue spoken by Madame Grossmann, ‘Wilhelmine Blondheim,’\r\ntragedy in three acts by Grossmann, and ‘Die grosse Batterie,’ comedy\r\nin one act by Ayrenhofer.” The same authority gives a list of all the\r\nperformances of the season, which extended to the 30th of May, 1779,\r\ntogether with débuts, the dismissals and other matters pertaining to\r\nthe actors. The number of the evenings on which the theatre was open\r\nwas 50. A five-act play, as a rule, occupied the whole performance,\r\nbut of shorter pieces usually two were given; and thus an opening was\r\nfound occasionally for an operetta. Of musical dramas only seven came\r\nupon the stage and these somewhat of the lightest order except the\r\nfirst--the melodrama “Ariadne auf Naxos,” music by Benda. The others\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n     1779. February 21. “Julie,” translated from the French by\r\n     Grossmann, music by Desaides.\r\n\r\n     February 28. “Die Jäger und das Waldmädchen,” operetta in one act,\r\n     music by Duni.\r\n\r\n     March 21. “Der Hofschmied,” in two acts, music by Philidor.\r\n\r\n     April 9. “Röschen und Colas,” in one act, music by Monsigny.\r\n\r\n     May 5. “Der Fassbinder,” in one act, music by Oudinot.\r\n\r\n     May 14. A prologue “Dedicated to the Birthday Festivities of His\r\n     Electoral Grace of Cologne, May 13, 1779, by J. A. Freyherrn vom\r\n     Hagen.”\r\n\r\nThe selection of dramas was, on the whole, very creditable to the\r\ntaste of the managers. Five of Lessing’s works, among them “Minna\r\nvon Barnhelm” and “Emilia Galotti,” are in the list and some of the\r\nbest productions of Bock, Gotter, Engel and their contemporaries; of\r\ntranslations there were Colman’s “Clandestine Marriage” and “Jealous\r\nWife,” Garrick’s “Miss in her Teens,” Cumberland’s “West Indian,”\r\nHoadly’s “Suspicious Husband,” Voltaire’s “Zaire” and “Jeannette,”\r\nBeaumarchais’s “Eugénie,” two or three of the works of Molière, and\r\nGoldoni, etc.;--in short, the list presents much variety and excellence.\r\n\r\nMax Friedrich was evidently pleased with the company, for the\r\n“Nachrichten” has the following in the catalogue of performances: “On\r\nthe 8th (of April) His Electoral Grace was pleased to give a splendid\r\nbreakfast to the entire company in the theatre.... The company will\r\noccupy itself until the return of His Electoral Grace from Münster,\r\nwhich will be in the middle of November, with learning the newest and\r\nbest pieces, among which are ‘Hamlet,’ ‘King Lear’ and ‘Macbeth,’ which\r\nare to be given also with much splendor of costume according to the\r\ndesigns of famous artists.”\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked here that the “Bonn Comedy House” (for painting the\r\ninterior of which Clemens August paid 468 thalers in 1751, a date which\r\nseems to fix the time at which that end of the palace was completed),\r\noccupied that portion of the present University Archæological Museum\r\nroom next the Coblenz Gate, with large doors opening from the stage\r\ninto the passageway so that this space could be used as an extension\r\nof the stage in pieces requiring it for the production of grand scenic\r\neffects. Above the theatre was the “Redouten-Saal” of Max Franz’s\r\ntime. The Elector had, of course, an entrance from the passages of\r\nthe palace into his box. The door for the public, in an angle of the\r\nwall now built up, opened out upon the grove of horse-chestnuts. The\r\nauditorium was necessarily low, but spacious enough for several hundred\r\nspectators. Though much criticized by travellers as being unworthy so\r\nelegant a court, not to say shabby, it seems to have been a nice and\r\nsnug little theatre.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile affairs with Seyler were drawing to a crisis. He had returned\r\nwith his company from Mannheim and reopened at Frankfort, August 3,\r\n1779. On the evening of the 17th, to escape imprisonment as a bankrupt,\r\nwhether through his own fault or that of another--the Theatre Lexicon\r\naffirms the latter case--he took his wife and fled to Mayence. The\r\ncompany was allowed by the magistrates to play a few weeks with a view\r\nof earning at least the means of leaving the city; but on October 4,\r\nits members began to separate; Benda and his wife went to Berlin, but\r\nC.

Neefe, the music director, and Opitz, descended the Rhine to Bonn\r\nand joined the company there--Neefe assuming temporarily the direction\r\nof the music in the theatre--of which more in another place.\r\n\r\nNo record has been found of the repertory of the Bonn theatre for the\r\nseason 1779-1780, except that the opening piece on December 3, on the\r\nevening after the Elector’s return from Münster, was a prologue, “Wir\r\nhaben Ihn wieder!” text by Baron vom Hagen, with airs, recitatives and\r\nchoruses composed by Neefe; that the “Déserteur” was in the list, and\r\nfinally Hiller’s “Jagd.” In June, 1781, the season being over, the\r\ncompany migrated to Pyrmont, from Pyrmont to Cassel, and thence, in\r\nOctober, back to Bonn.\r\n\r\nANOTHER BUSY SEASON AT BONN\r\n\r\nThe season of 1781-’82 was a busy one; of musical dramas alone 17 are\r\nreported as newly rehearsed from September, 1781, to the same time in\r\n1782, viz:\r\n\r\n    “Die Liebe unter den Handwerkern”\r\n      (“L’Amore Artigiano”)             Music by Gassmann\r\n    “Robert und Calliste”                „    „  Guglielmi\r\n    “Der Alchymist”                      „    „  Schuster.\r\n    “Das tartarische Gesetz”             „    „  d’Antoine (of Bonn)\r\n    “Der eifersüchtige Liebhaber”\r\n      (“L’Amant jaloux”)                 „    „  Grétry\r\n    “Der Hausfreund”\r\n      (“L’Ami de la Maison”)             „    „  Grétry\r\n    “Die Freundschaft auf der Probe”\r\n      (“L’Amitié à l’Épreuve”)           „    „  Grétry\r\n    “Heinrich und Lyda”                  „    „  Neefe\r\n    “Die Apotheke”                       „    „  Neefe\r\n    “Eigensinn und Launen der Liebe”     „    „  Deler (Teller, Deller?)\r\n    “Romeo und Julie”                    „    „  Benda\r\n    “Sophonisba” (Deklamation mit Musik) „    „  Neefe\r\n    “Lucille”                            „    „  Grétry\r\n    “Milton und Elmire”                  „    „  Mihl (or Mühle)\r\n    “Die Samnitische Vermählungsfeier”\r\n      (“Le Marriage des Samnites”)       „    „  Grétry\r\n    “Ernst und Lucinde”                  „    „  Grétry\r\n    “Günther von Schwarzburg”            „    „  Holzbauer\r\n\r\nIt does not follow, however, that all these operas, operettas and\r\nplays with music were produced during the season in Bonn. The company\r\nfollowed the Elector to Münster in June, 1782, and removed thence\r\nto Frankfort-on-the-Main for its regular series of performances at\r\nMichaelmas. It came back to Bonn in the Autumn.\r\n\r\nThe season 1782-’83 was as active as the preceding. Some of the newly\r\nrehearsed spoken dramas were “Sir John Falstaff,” from the English,\r\ntranslations of Sheridan’s “School for Scandal,” Shakespeare’s “Lear,”\r\nand “Richard III,” Mrs. Cowley’s “Who’s the Dupe?” and, of original\r\nGerman plays, Schiller’s “Fiesco” and “Die Räuber,” Lessing’s “Miss\r\nSara Sampson,” Schroeder’s “Testament,” etc., etc. The number of newly\r\nrehearsed musical dramas--in which class are included such ballad\r\noperas as General Burgoyne’s “Maid of the Oaks”--reached twenty, viz:\r\n\r\n    “Das Rosenfest”                        Music by Wolf (of Weimar)\r\n    “Azalia”                                „    „  Johann Küchler\r\n                                                      (Bassoonist in\r\n                                                      the Bonn chapel)\r\n    “Die Sklavin” (_La Schiava_)            „    „  Piccini\r\n    “Zémire et Azor”                        „    „  Grétry\r\n    “Das Mädchen im Eichthale”\r\n    (“Maid of the Oaks”)                    „    „  d’Antoine (Captain\r\n                                                      in the army of the\r\n                                                      Elector of Cologne)\r\n    “Der Kaufmann von Smyrna”               „    „  J.

The titles of five newly rehearsed ballets are given\r\nin the report from which the above particulars are taken, and which may\r\nbe found in the theatrical calendar for 1784.\r\n\r\nWith an enlarged company and a more extensive repertory, preparations\r\nwere made for opening the theatre upon the Elector’s return, at the end\r\nof October, from Münster to Bonn. But the relations of the company to\r\nthe court have been changed. Let the “Theater-Kalender” describe the\r\nnew position in which the stage at Bonn was placed:\r\n\r\n     Bonn. His Electoral Grace, by a special condescension, had\r\n     graciously determined to make the theatrical performances\r\n     gratuitous and to that end has closed a contract with His\r\n     Highness’s Theatrical Director Grossmann according to which\r\n     besides the theatre free of rent, the illumination and the\r\n     orchestra he is to receive an annual subvention for the\r\n     maintenance of the company. On His Highness’s command there will\r\n     be two or three performances weekly. By particular grace the\r\n     director is permitted to spend several summer months in other\r\n     places.\r\n\r\nAN INFLUENCE ON THE BOY BEETHOVEN\r\n\r\nThe advantages of this plan for securing a good repertory, a good\r\ncompany and a zealous striving for improvement are obvious; and its\r\npractical working during this, its only, season, so far as can now be\r\ngathered from scanty records, was a great success. It will hereafter\r\nbe seen that the boy Ludwig van Beethoven was often employed at the\r\npianoforte at the rehearsals--possibly also at the performances of\r\nthe company of which Neefe was the musical director. That a company\r\nconsisting almost exclusively of performers who had passed the ordeal\r\nof frequent appearance on the stage and had been selected with full\r\nknowledge of the capacity of each, and which, moreover, had gained so\r\nmuch success at the Bonn court as to be put upon a permanent footing,\r\nmust have been one of more than the ordinary, average excellence, at\r\nleast in light opera, needs no argument. Nor need comments be made\r\nupon the influence which daily intercourse with it, and sharing in its\r\nlabors, especially in the direction of opera, must have exerted upon\r\nthe mind of a boy of twelve or thirteen years possessed of real musical\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nThe theatrical season, and with it the company, came to an untimely\r\nend. Belderbusch died in January, 1784. Madame Grossmann died in\r\nchildbed on March 28, and on April 15 the Elector followed them to\r\nanother world. After the death of the Elector Maximilian Friedrich the\r\nCourt Theatre was closed for the official mourning and the company\r\ndismissed with four weeks’ salary.\r\n\r\nIt is consonant to the plan of this introductory chapter that some\r\nspace be devoted to sketches of some of the principal men whose names\r\nhave already occurred and to some notes upon the musical amateurs of\r\nBonn who are known, or may be supposed, to have been friends of the\r\nboy Beethoven. These notices make no claim to the credit of being the\r\nresult of original research; they are, except that of Neefe, little\r\nmore than extracts from a letter, dated March 2, 1783, written by\r\nNeefe and printed in Cramer’s “Magazin der Musik” (Vol. I, pp. 337 _et\r\nseq._). At that time the “Capelldirector,” as Neefe calls him, was\r\nCajetano Mattioli, born at Venice, August 7, 1750, whose appointments\r\nwere concertmaster and musical director in Bonn, made on May 26, 1774\r\nand April 24, 1777.\r\n\r\n     He studied in Parma, says Neefe, with the first violinist Angelo\r\n     Moriggi, a pupil of Tartini, and in Parma, Mantua and Bologna\r\n     conducted grand operas like “Orfeo,” “Alceste,” etc., by the\r\n     Chevalier Gluck with success. He owed much to the example set by\r\n     Gluck in the matter of conducting. It must be admitted that he is\r\n     a man full of fire, of lively temperament and fine feeling. He\r\n     penetrates quickly into the intentions of a composer and knows how\r\n     to convey them promptly and clearly to the entire orchestra. He\r\n     was the first to introduce accentuation, instrumental declamation,\r\n     careful attention to forte and piano, or all the degrees of\r\n     light and shade in the orchestra of this place. In none of the\r\n     qualifications of a leader is he second to the famed Cannabich of\r\n     Mannheim. He surpasses him in musical enthusiasm, and, like him,\r\n     insists upon discipline and order. Through his efforts the musical\r\n     repertory of this court has been provided with a very considerable\r\n     collection of good and admirable compositions, symphonies, masses\r\n     and other works, to which he makes daily additions; in the same\r\n     manner he is continually striving for the betterment of the\r\n     orchestra. Just now he is engaged in a project for building a\r\n     new organ for the court chapel. The former organ, a magnificent\r\n     instrument, became a prey of the flames at the great conflagration\r\n     in the palace in 1777. His salary is 1,000 fl.\r\n\r\n     The chapelmaster (appointed May 26, 1774) was Mr. Andrea Lucchesi,\r\n     born May 28, 1741, at Motta in Venetian territory. His teachers\r\n     in composition were, in the theatre style, Mr. Cocchi of Naples;\r\n     in the church style, Father Paolucci, a pupil of Padre Martini at\r\n     Bologna, and afterwards Mr. Seratelli, Chapelmaster of the Duke\r\n     of Venice. He is a good organist and occupied himself profitably\r\n     with the instrument in Italy. He came here with Mr. Mattioli as\r\n     conductor of an Italian opera company in 1771. Taken altogether\r\n     he is a light, pleasing and gay composer whose part-writing is\r\n     cleaner than that of most of his countrymen. In his church-works\r\n     he does not confine himself to the strict style affected by many\r\n     to please amateurs. Neefe enumerates Lucchesi’s compositions as\r\n     follows: 9 works for the theatre, among them the opera “L’Isola\r\n     della Fortuna” (1765), “Il Marito geloso” (1766), “Le Donne sempre\r\n     Donne,” “Il Matrimonio per astuzia” (1771) for Venice, and the two\r\n     composed at Bonn, “Il Natal di Giove” and “L’inganno scoperto,”\r\n     various intermezzi and cantatas; various masses, vespers and other\r\n     compositions for the church; six sonatas for the pianoforte and\r\n     violin; a pianoforte trio, four pianoforte quartets and several\r\n     pianoforte concertos. His salary was 1,000 fl.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN GOTTLOB NEEFE’S CAREER\r\n\r\nThe organist of the Court Chapel was Christian Gottlob Neefe, son of a\r\npoor tailor of Chemnitz in Saxony, where he was born February 5, 1748.\r\nHe is one of the many instances in musical history in which the career\r\nof the man is determined by the beauty of his voice in childhood. At\r\na very early age he became a chorister in the principal church, which\r\nposition gave him the best school and musical instruction that the\r\nsmall city afforded--advantages so wisely improved as to enable him in\r\nearly youth to gain a living by teaching. At the age of 21, with 20\r\nthalers in his pocket and a stipend of 30 thalers per annum from the\r\nmagistrates of Chemnitz, he removed to Leipsic to attend the lectures\r\nof the university, and at that institution in the course of time he\r\npassed his examination in jurisprudence. Upon this occasion he argued\r\nthe negative of the question: “Has a father the right to disinherit\r\na son for devoting himself to the theatre?” In Chemnitz Neefe’s\r\nteachers in music had been men of small talents and very limited\r\nacquirements, and even in Leipsic he owed more to his persevering\r\nstudy of the theoretical works of Marpurg and C. P. E. Bach than to\r\nany regular instructor. But there he had the very great advantage\r\nof forming an intimate acquaintance with, and becoming an object of\r\nspecial interest to, Johann Adam Hiller, the celebrated director of\r\nthe Gewandhaus Concerts, the then popular and famous composer, the\r\nintroducer of Handel’s “Messiah” to the German public, the industrious\r\nwriter upon music, and finally a successor of Johann Sebastian Bach\r\nas Cantor of the Thomas School. Hiller gave him every encouragement\r\nin his power in his musical career; opened the columns of his musical\r\n“Wöchentliche Nachrichten” to his compositions and writings; called\r\nhim to his assistance in operatic composition; gave him the results of\r\nhis long experience in friendly advice; criticized his compositions,\r\nand at length, in 1777, gave him his own position as music director\r\nof Seyler’s theatrical company, then playing at the Linkische Bad in\r\nDresden. Upon the departure of that troupe for Frankfort-on-the-Main,\r\nNeefe was persuaded to remain with it in the same capacity. He thus\r\nbecame acquainted with Fräulein Zinck, previously court singer at\r\nGotha but now engaged for Seyler’s opera. The acquaintance ripened\r\ninto a mutual affection and ended in marriage not long afterward. It\r\nis no slight testimony to the high reputation which he enjoyed that\r\nat the moment of Seyler’s flight from Frankfort (1779) Bondini, whose\r\nsuccess had driven that rival from Dresden, was in correspondence with\r\nNeefe and making him proposals to resign his position under Seyler\r\nfor a similar but better one in his service. Pending the result of\r\nthese negotiations Neefe, taking his wife with him, temporarily joined\r\nGrossmann and Helmuth at Bonn in the same capacity. Those managers,\r\nwho knew the value of his services from their previous experience as\r\nmembers of the Seyler troupe, paid a very strong, though involuntary,\r\ntribute to his talents and personal character by adopting such unfair\r\nmeasures as to compel the musician to remain in Bonn until Bondini was\r\nforced to fill his vacancy by another candidate. Having once got him,\r\nGrossmann was determined to keep him--and succeeded.\r\n\r\nAs long as the Grossmann company remained undivided Neefe accompanied\r\nit in its annual visits to Münster and other places;--thus the sketch\r\nof his life printed sixteen years later in the first volume of the\r\n“Allgemeine Musikzeitung” of Leipsic bears date “Frankfort-on-the-Main,\r\nSeptember 30, 1782”; but from that period save, perhaps, for a short\r\ntime in 1783, he seems not to have left Bonn at all.\r\n\r\nThere were others besides Grossmann and Helmuth who thought Neefe\r\ntoo valuable an acquisition to the musical circles of Bonn not to\r\nbe secured. Less than a year and a half after his arrival there the\r\nminister Belderbusch and the countess Hatzfeld, niece of the Elector,\r\nsecured to him, though a Protestant, an appointment to the place of\r\ncourt organist. The salary of 400 florins, together with the 700\r\nflorins from Grossmann, made his income equal to that of the court\r\nchapelmaster. It is difficult now to conceive of the forgotten name\r\nof C. G. Neefe as having once stood high in the list of the first\r\nNorth German composers; yet such was the case. Of Neefe’s published\r\ncompositions, besides the short vocal and clavier pieces in Hiller’s\r\nperiodical, there had already appeared operettas in vocal score,\r\n“Die Apotheke” (1772), “Amor’s Guckkasten” (1772), “Die Einsprüche”\r\n(1773) and “Heinrich und Lyda” (1777); also airs composed for Hiller’s\r\n“Dorf-Barbier” and one from his own republished opera “Zemire und\r\nAzor”; twelve odes of Klopstock--sharply criticized by Forkel in his\r\n“Musikalisch-Kritische Bibliothek,” much to the benefit of the second\r\nedition of them; and a pretty long series of songs. Of instrumental\r\nmusic he had printed twenty-four sonatas for pianoforte solo or with\r\nviolin; and from Breitkopf and Härtel’s catalogues, 1772 and 1774,\r\nmay be added the following works included neither in his own list\r\nnor that of Gerber: a partita for string quartet, 2 horns, 2 oboes,\r\n2 flutes and 2 bassoons; another for the same instruments minus the\r\nflutes and bassoons; a third for the string quartet and 2 oboes only,\r\nand two symphonies for string quartet, 2 horns, 2 oboes and 2 flutes.\r\nThe “Sophonisbe” music was also finished and twenty years later, after\r\nMozart had given a new standard of criticism, it was warmly eulogized\r\nin the “Allgemeine Musikzeitung” of Leipsic. At the date of his letter\r\nto Cramer (March 2, 1783) he had added to his published works “Sechs\r\nSonaten am Clavier zu singen,” “Vademecum für Liebhaber des Gesangs\r\nund Clavier,” the clavier score of “Sophonisbe,” and a concerto for\r\nclavier and orchestra. His manuscripts, he adds (Cramer’s “Magazine,”\r\nI; p. 382), consist of (a) the scores of the operettas which had\r\nappeared in pianoforte arrangements; (b) the score of his opera “Zemire\r\nund Azor”; (c) the score of his opera “Adelheit von Veltheim”; (d) the\r\nscore of a bardic song for the tragedy “The Romans in Germany”; (e)\r\nthe scores of theatrical between-acts music; (f) the score of a Latin\r\n“Pater noster”; (g) various other smaller works. He had in hand the\r\ncomposition of the operetta “Der neue Gutsherr,” the pianoforte score\r\nof which, as also that of “Adelheit von Veltheim,” was about to be\r\npublished by Dyck in Leipsic. A year before at a concert for amateurs\r\nat the house of Mr. von Mastiaux he had produced an ode by Klopstock,\r\n“Dem Unendlichen,” for four chorus voices and a large orchestra, which\r\nwas afterwards performed in Holy Week in the _Fräuleinstiftskirche_.\r\nIn short, Neefe brought to Bonn a high-sounding reputation, talent,\r\nskill and culture both musical and literary, which made him invaluable\r\nto the managers when new French and Italian operas were to be prepared\r\nfor the German stage; great facility in throwing off a new air, song,\r\n_entr’acte_ or what not to meet the exigencies of the moment; very\r\ngreat industry, a _cacoethes scribendi_ of the very highest value to\r\nthe student of Bonn’s musical history in his time and a new element\r\ninto the musical life there. This element may have seemed somewhat\r\nformal and pedantic, but it was solid, for it was drawn from the school\r\nof Handel and Bach.\r\n\r\nMUSIC IN PRIVATE HOUSES OF BONN\r\n\r\nLet us return to Neefe’s letter to Cramer again for some notices of\r\nmusic outside the electoral palace:\r\n\r\n     Belderbusch, the minister, retained a quintet of wind-instruments,\r\n     2 clarinets, 2 horns and a bassoon.\r\n\r\n     The Countess von Belderbusch, wife of a nephew of the minister,\r\n     whose name will come up again, “plays skilfully upon the clavier.”\r\n\r\n     The Countess von Hatzfeld, niece of the Elector, was “trained\r\n     in singing and clavier playing by the best masters of Vienna to\r\n     whom, indeed, she does very much honor. She declaims recitatives\r\n     admirably and it is a pleasure to listen to her sing arias _di\r\n     parlante_. She plays the fortepiano brilliantly and in playing\r\n     yields herself up completely to her emotions, wherefore one never\r\n     hears any restlessness or uneveness of time in her _tempo rubato_.\r\n     She is enthusiastically devoted to music and musicians.”[4]\r\n\r\n     Chancellor and Captain von Schall “plays clavier and violin.\r\n     Though not adept on either instrument he has very correct musical\r\n     feeling. He knows how to appreciate the true beauties of a\r\n     composition, and how to judge them, and has large historical and\r\n     literary knowledge of music.”\r\n\r\n     Frau Court Councillor von Belzer “plays the clavier and sings.\r\n     She has a strong, masculine contralto of wide range, particularly\r\n     downwards.”\r\n\r\n     Johann Gottfried von Mastiaux, of the Finance Department and\r\n     incumbent of divers high offices, is a self-taught musician. He\r\n     plays several instruments himself and has given his four sons and\r\n     a daughter the best musical instruction possible in Bonn. All\r\n     are pianists and so many of them performers on other instruments\r\n     that the production of quintets is a common family enjoyment. He\r\n     is a devoted admirer of Haydn, with whom he corresponds, and in\r\n     his large collection of music there are already 80 symphonies,\r\n     30 quartets and 40 trios by that master. His rare and valuable\r\n     instruments are so numerous “that he could almost equip a complete\r\n     orchestra. Every musician is his friend and welcome to him.”\r\n\r\n     Count Altstädter: “in his house one may at times hear a very good\r\n     quartet.”\r\n\r\n     Captain Dantoine, “a passionate admirer and knower of music; plays\r\n     the violin and the clavier a little. He learned composition from\r\n     the books of Marpurg, Kirnberger and Riepel. Formed his taste in\r\n     Italy. In both respects the reading of scores by classical masters\r\n     has been of great service to him.” Among his compositions are\r\n     several operettas, symphonies and quartets “in Haydn’s style.”\r\n\r\n     The three Messrs. Facius, “sons of the Russian agent here, are\r\n     soundly musical; the two elder play the flute and the youngest\r\n     plays the violoncello.” (According to Fischer the members of this\r\n     family were visitors at the house of the Beethovens.)\r\n\r\n     There are many more music-lovers here, but the majority of them\r\n     are too much given to privacy, so far as their musical practice\r\n     goes, to be mentioned here. Enough has been said to show that a\r\n     stranger fond of music need never leave Bonn without nourishment.\r\n     Nevertheless, a large public concert institution under the\r\n     patronage of His Electoral Grace is still desirable. It would be\r\n     one more ornament of the capital and a promoter of the good cause\r\n     of music.\r\n\r\nWhat with the theatre, the court music, the musical productions in the\r\nchurch and such opportunities in private it is plain that young talent\r\nin those days in Bonn was in no danger of starvation for want of what\r\nNeefe calls “musikalische Nahrung.”\r\n\r\nSo much upon the _dramatis personæ_, other than the principal figure\r\nand his family. Let an attempt follow to describe the little city\r\nas it appeared in 1770--in other words, to picture the scene. By an\r\nenumeration made in 1789, the population of Bonn was 9,560 souls, a\r\nnumber which probably for a long series of years had rarely varied\r\nbeyond a few score, more or less--one, therefore, that must very nearly\r\nrepresent the aggregate in 1770. For the town had neither manufactures\r\nnor commerce beyond what its own wants supported; it was simply the\r\nresidence of the Elector--the seat of the court, and the people\r\ndepended more or less directly upon that court for subsistence--as a\r\nwag expressed it, “all Bonn was fed from the Elector’s kitchen.” The\r\nold city walls--(the “gar gute Fortification, dass der Churfürst sicher\r\ngenug darinnen Hof halten kann” of Johann Hübner’s description)--were\r\nalready partially destroyed. Within them the whole population seems to\r\nhave lived. Outside the city gates it does not appear that, save by\r\na chapel or two, the eye was impeded in its sweep across gardens and\r\nopen fields to the surrounding villages which, then as now hidden in\r\nclusters of walnut and fruit trees, appeared, when looked upon from\r\nthe neighboring hills, like islands rising upon the level surface of\r\nthe plain. The great increase of wealth and population during the last\r\n150 years in all this part of the Rhine valley under the influence of\r\nthe wise national economy of the Prussian government, has produced\r\ncorresponding changes in and about the towns and villages; but the\r\ngrand features of the landscape are unchanged; the ruins upon the\r\nDrachenfels and Godesberg looked down, as now, upon the distant roofs\r\nand spires of Bonn; the castle of Siegburg rose above the plains away\r\nto the East; the chapel crowned the Petersberg, the church with the\r\nmarble stairs the nearer Kreuzberg.\r\n\r\nA PROSPECT OF BONN IN BEETHOVEN’S DAY\r\n\r\nThe fine landing place with its growing trees and seats for idlers,\r\nthe villas, hotels, coffee-houses and dwellings outside the old walls,\r\nare all recent; but the huge ferryboat, the “flying bridge,” even\r\nthen was ever swinging like a pendulum from shore to shore. Steam as\r\na locomotive power was unknown, and the commerce of the Rhine floated\r\nby the town, gliding down with the current on rafts or in clumsy\r\nbut rather picturesque boats, or impelled against the stream by the\r\nwinds, by horses and even by men and women. The amount of traffic was\r\nnot, however, too great to be amply provided for in this manner; for\r\npopulation was kept down by war, by the hard and rude life of the\r\npeasant class, and by the influences of all the false national-economic\r\nprinciples of that age, which restrained commerce by every device\r\nthat could be made to yield present profit to the rulers of the Rhine\r\nlands. Passengers had, for generations, no longer been plundered by\r\nmail-clad robbers dwelling upon a hundred picturesque heights; but each\r\npetty state had gained from the Emperor’s weakness “vested rights”\r\nin all sorts of custom-levies and taxes. Risbeck (1780) found nine\r\ntoll-stations between Mayence and Coblenz; and thence to the boundary\r\nof Holland, he declares there were at least sixteen, and that in the\r\naverage each must have collected 30,000 Rhenish florins per annum.\r\n\r\nTo the stranger, coming down from Mayence, with its narrow dark\r\nlanes, or up from Cologne, whose confined and pestiferously dirty\r\nstreets, emitting unnamed stenches, were but typical of the bigotry,\r\nsuperstition and moral filth of the population--all now happily\r\nchanged, thanks to a long period of French and Prussian rule--little\r\nBonn seemed a very picture of neatness and comfort. Even its\r\necclesiastical life seemed of another order. The men of high rank in\r\nthe church were of high rank also by birth; they were men of the world\r\nand gentlemen; their manners were polished and their minds enlarged by\r\nintercourse with the world and with gentlemen; they were tolerant in\r\ntheir opinions and liberal in their views. Ecclesiastics of high and\r\nlow degree were met at every corner as in other cities of the Rhine\r\nregion; but absence of military men was a remarkable feature. Johann\r\nHübner gives the reason for this in few and quaint words:--“In times\r\nof war much depends upon who is master of Bonn, because traffic on\r\nthe Rhine can be blockaded at this pass. Therefore the place has its\r\nexcellent fortification which enables the Elector to hold his court in\r\nample security within its walls. But he need not maintain a garrison\r\nthere in time of peace, and in time of war troops are garrisoned who\r\nhave taken the oath to the Emperor and the empire. This was settled by\r\nthe peace of Ryswick as well as Rastatt.”\r\n\r\nWhile the improvement in the appearance of the streets of Bonn has\r\nnecessarily been great, through the refitting or rebuilding of a large\r\nportion of the dwelling-houses, the plan of the town, except in those\r\nparts lying near the wall, has undergone no essential change, the\r\nprincipal one being the open spaces, where in 1770 churches stood. On\r\nthe small triangular Römer-Platz was the principal parish church of\r\nBonn, that of St. Remigius, standing in such a position that its tall\r\ntower looked directly down the Acherstrasse. In 1800 this tower was\r\nset on fire by lightning and destroyed; six years later the church\r\nitself was demolished by the French and its stones removed to become\r\na part of the fortifications at Wesel. On the small, round grass plot\r\nas one goes from the Münster church toward the neighboring city gate\r\n(Neuthor) stood another parish church--a rotunda in form--that of St.\r\nMartin, which fell in 1812 and was removed; and at the opposite end\r\nof the minster, separated from it only by a narrow passage, was still\r\na third, the small structure dedicated to St. Gangolph. This, too,\r\nwas pulled down in 1806. Only the fourth parish church, that of St.\r\nPeter in Dietkirchen, is still in existence and was, at a later date,\r\nconsiderably enlarged. After the demolition of these buildings a new\r\ndivision of the town into parishes was made (1806).\r\n\r\nThe city front of the electoral palace, now the university, was more\r\nimposing than now, and was adorned by a tall, handsome tower containing\r\na carillon, with bells numerous enough to play, for instance, the\r\noverture to Monsigny’s “Deserter.” This part of the palace, with the\r\ntower and chapel, was destroyed by fire in 1777.\r\n\r\nThe town hall, erected by Clemens August, and the other churches were\r\nas now, but the large edifice facing the university library and museum\r\nof casts, now occupied by private dwellings and shops, was then the\r\ncloister and church of the Franciscan monks. A convent of Capuchin nuns\r\nstood upon the Kesselgasse; its garden is now a bleaching ground.\r\n\r\nHOLIDAY TIMES IN THE LITTLE CITY\r\n\r\nLet the fancy picture, upon a fine Easter or Pentecost morning in those\r\nyears, the little city in its holiday attire and bustle. The bells in\r\npalace and church tower ringing; the peasants in coarse but picturesque\r\ngarments, the women abounding in bright colors, come in from the\r\nsurrounding villages, fill the market-place and crowd the churches\r\nat the early masses. The nobles and gentry--in broad-flapped coats,\r\nwide waistcoats and knee-breeches, the entire dress often of brilliant\r\ncolored silks, satins and velvets, huge, white, flowing neckcloths,\r\nruffles over the hands, buckles of silver or even of gold at the knees\r\nand upon the shoes, huge wigs becurled and bepowdered on the heads,\r\nand surmounted by the cocked hat, when not held under the arm, a sword\r\nat the side, and commonly a gold-headed cane in the hand (and if the\r\nmorning be cold, a scarlet cloak thrown over the shoulders)--are\r\ndaintily picking their way to the palace to kiss His Transparency’s\r\nhand or dashing up to the gates in heavy carriages with white wigged\r\nand cocked-hatted coachmen and footmen. Their ladies wear long and\r\nnarrow bodices, but their robes flow with a mighty sweep; their\r\napparent stature is increased by very high-heeled shoes and by piling\r\nup their hair on lofty cushions; their sleeves are short, but long silk\r\ngloves cover the arms. The ecclesiastics, various in name and costume,\r\ndress as now, save in the matter of the flowing wig. The Elector’s\r\ncompany of guards is out and at intervals the thunder of the artillery\r\non the walls is heard. On all sides, strong and brilliant contrasts of\r\ncolor meet the eye, velvet and silk, purple and fine linen, gold and\r\nsilver--such were the fashions of the time--costly, inconvenient in\r\nform, but imposing, magnificent and marking the differences of rank\r\nand class. Let the imagination picture all this, and it will have a\r\nscene familiar to the boy Beethoven, and one in which as he grew up to\r\nmanhood he had his own small part to play.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] “Briefe,” II. 354, 355.\r\n\r\n[2] This was the beginning of the career of Salomon. He became\r\nconcertmaster to Prince Henry of Prussia, played in Paris, and in 1781\r\ntook up a residence in London where, as violinist and conductor, he\r\nbecame brilliantly active and successful.

A member of it\r\nremoved to and settled in Antwerp about 1650. A son of this Beethoven,\r\nnamed William, a wine dealer, married, September 11, 1680, Catherine\r\nGrandjean and had issue, eight children. One of them, baptized\r\nSeptember 8, 1683, in the parish of Notre Dame, now received the name\r\nHenry Adelard, his sponsors being Henry van Beethoven, acting for\r\nAdelard de Redincq, Baron de Rocquigny, and Jacqueline Grandjean. This\r\nHenry Adelard Beethoven, having arrived at man’s estate, took to wife\r\nMaria Catherine de Herdt, who bore him twelve children--the third named\r\nLouis, the twelfth named Louis Joseph. The latter, baptized December 9,\r\n1728, married, November 3, 1773, Maria Theresa Schuerweghs, and died\r\nNovember 11, 1808, at Oosterwyck. The second daughter, named like her\r\nmother Maria Theresa, married, September 6, 1808, Joseph Michael Jacobs\r\nand became the mother of Jacob Jacobs, in the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury a professor of painting in Antwerp, who supplied in part the\r\nmaterials for these notices of the Antwerp Beethovens, although the\r\nprincipal credit is due to M. Léon de Burbure of that city.[5]\r\n\r\nThe certificate of baptism of Louis van Beethoven, third son of Henry\r\nAdelard, is to this effect:\r\n\r\n     Antwerp, December 23, 1712--_Baptizatus_, Ludovicus.\r\n\r\n     Parents: Henricus van Beethoven and Maria Catherine de Hert.\r\n\r\n     Sponsors: Petrus Bellmaert and Dymphona van Beethoven.\r\n\r\nIt is a family tradition--Prof. Jacobs heard it from his mother--that\r\nthis Louis van Beethoven, owing to some domestic difficulties\r\n(according to M. Burbure they were financial), secretly left his\r\nfather’s house at an early age and never saw it again, although in\r\nlater years an epistolary correspondence seems to have been established\r\nbetween the fugitive and his parents. Gifted with a good voice and\r\nwell educated musically, he went to Louvain and applied for a vacant\r\nposition as tenor to the chapter ad Sanctum Petrum, receiving it\r\non November 2, 1731.[6] A few days later the young man of 18 years\r\nwas appointed substitute for three months for the singing master\r\n(_Phonascus_), who had fallen ill, as is attested by the minutes of the\r\nChapter, under date November 2, 1731.[7]\r\n\r\nThe young singer does not seem to have filled the place beyond the\r\nprescribed time. By a decree of Elector Clemens August, dated March,\r\n1733 (the month of Joseph Haydn’s birth), he became Court Musician\r\nin Bonn with a salary of 400 florins, a large one for those days,\r\nparticularly in the case of a young man who only three months before\r\nhad completed his 20th year. Allowing the usual year of probation\r\nto which candidates for the court chapel were subjected, Beethoven\r\nmust have come to Bonn in 1732. This corresponds to the time spent at\r\nLouvain as well as to a petition of 1774, to be given hereafter, in\r\nwhich Johann speaks of his father’s “42 years of service.” There is\r\nanother paper of date 1784 which makes the elder Beethoven to have\r\nserved about 46 years, but this is from another hand and of less\r\nauthority than that written by the son.\r\n\r\nOTHER BEETHOVEN FAMILIES IN BONN\r\n\r\nWhat it was that persuaded Ludwig van Beethoven to go to Bonn is\r\nunknown. Gottfried Fischer, who owned the house in the Rheingasse in\r\nwhich two generations of Beethovens lived, professed to know that\r\nElector Clemens August learned to know him as a good singer at Liège\r\nand for that reason called him to Bonn. That is not impossible,\r\nwhether the Elector went to Louvain or Ludwig introduced himself to him\r\nat Liège. But it is significant that another branch of the Beethoven\r\nfamily was already represented at Bonn. Michael van Beethoven was born\r\nin Malines in February, 1684. He was a son of Cornelius van Beethoven\r\nand Catherine Leempoel, and beyond doubt, as the later associations\r\nin Bonn prove, closely related to the Antwerp branch of the family.\r\nMichael van Beethoven married Maria Ludovica Stuykers (or Stuykens)\r\non October 8, 1707. His eldest son also bore the name of Cornelius\r\n(born in September, 1708, in Malines) and there were four other sons\r\nborn to him during his stay in Malines, among them two who were named\r\nLouis, up to 1715. At a date which is uncertain, this family removed\r\nto Bonn. There Cornelius, on February 20, 1734, married a widow named\r\nHelena de la Porte (née Calem), in the church of St. Gangolph, Ludwig\r\nvan Beethoven, the young court singer, being one of the witnesses.\r\nIn August of the same year Cornelius was proxy for his father (who,\r\nevidently, had not yet come to Bonn), as godfather for Ludwig’s first\r\nchild. Later, after his son had established a household, he removed to\r\nBonn, for Michael van Beethoven died in June, 1749, in Bonn, and in\r\nDecember of the same year Maria Ludovica Stuykens (_sic_), “the Widow\r\nvan Beethoven.” Cornelius became a citizen of Bonn on January 17, 1736,\r\non the ground that he had married the widow of a citizen, and in 1738\r\nhe stands alone as representative of the name in the list of Bonn’s\r\ncitizens. He seems to have been a merchant, and is probably the man\r\nwho figures in the annual accounts of Clemens August as purveyor of\r\ncandles. He lost his wife, and for a second married Anna Barbara Marx,\r\n_virgo_, on July 5, 1755, who bore him two daughters (1756 and 1759),\r\nboth of whom died young and for both of whom Ludwig van Beethoven was\r\nsponsor. Cornelius died in 1764 and his wife in 1765, and with this\r\nthe Malines branch of the family ended. Which one of the two cousins\r\n(for so we may in a general way consider them) came to Bonn, Ludwig\r\nor Cornelius, must be left to conjecture. There is evidence in favor\r\nof the former in the circumstance that Cornelius does not appear as\r\nwitness at the marriage of Ludwig in 1733. If Ludwig was the earlier\r\narrival, then the story of his call by the Elector may be true; he was\r\nnot disappointed in his hope of being able to make his way by reason of\r\nhis knowledge of music and singing.\r\n\r\nThe next recorded fact in his history may be seen in the ancient\r\nregister of the parish of St. Remigius, now preserved in the town\r\nhall of Bonn. It is the marriage on September 7, 1733, of Ludwig van\r\nBeethoven and Maria Josepha Poll, the husband not yet 21 years of age,\r\nthe wife 19. Then follows in the records of baptisms in the parish:\r\n\r\n    1734, August 8.\r\n\r\n    _Parents_:\r\n\r\n    Ludwig van Beethoven,\r\n    Maria Josepha Poll.\r\n\r\n    _Baptized_:\r\n\r\n    Maria\r\n    Bernardina\r\n    Ludovica.\r\n\r\n    _Sponsors_:\r\n\r\n    Maria Bernardina Menz,\r\n    Michael van Beethoven;\r\n    in his place Cornelius van\r\n    Beethoven.\r\n\r\nThe child Bernardina died in infancy, October 17, 1735. Her place was\r\nsoon filled by a son, Marcus Josephus, baptized April 15, 1736, of\r\nwhom the parents were doubtless early bereaved, for no other notice\r\nwhatever has been found of him. After the lapse of some four years\r\nthe childless pair again became parents, by the birth of a son, whose\r\nbaptismal record has not been discovered. It is supposed that this\r\nchild, Johann, was baptized in the Court Chapel, the records of which\r\nare not preserved in the archives of the town and seem to be lost; or\r\nthat, possibly, he was born while the mother was absent from Bonn.\r\nAn official report upon the condition and characters of the court\r\nmusicians made in 1784, however, gives Johann van Beethoven _born in\r\nBonn_ and aged forty-four--thus fixing the date of his birth towards\r\nthe end of 1739 or the beginning of 1740.\r\n\r\nThe gradual improvement of the elder Beethoven’s condition in respect\r\nof both emolument and social position, is creditable to him alike as\r\na musician and as a man. Poorly as the musicians were paid, he was\r\nable in his last years to save a small portion of his earnings; his\r\nrise in social position is indicated in the public records;--thus, the\r\nfirst child is recorded as the son of L. v. Beethoven “musicus”; as\r\nsponsor to the eldest daughter of Cornelius van Beethoven, he appears\r\nas “Dominus” van Beethoven;--to the second as “Musicus Aulicus”; in\r\n1761 he becomes “Herr Kapellmeister,” and his name appears in the\r\nCourt Calendar of the same year, third in a list of twenty-eight\r\n“Hommes de chambre honoraires.” Of the elder Beethoven’s appointment\r\nas head of the court music no other particulars have been obtained\r\nthan those to be found in his petition and the accompanying decree\r\nprinted in Chapter I. From these papers it appears that the bass singer\r\nhas had the promise of the place from Clemens August as successor to\r\nZudoli, but that the Elector, when the vacancy occurred, changed his\r\nmind and gave it to his favorite young violinist Touchemoulin, who\r\nheld the position for so short a time, however, that his name never\r\nappears as chapelmaster in the Court Calendar, he having resigned on\r\naccount of the reduction of his salary by Belderbusch, prime minister\r\nof the new Elector who just at that period succeeded Clemens August.\r\nThe elevation of a singer to such a place was not a very uncommon\r\nevent in those days, but that a chapelmaster should still retain his\r\nplace as singer probably was. Hasse and Graun began their careers\r\nas vocalists, but more to the point are the instances of Steffani,\r\nHandel’s predecessor at the court of Hanover, and of Righini,\r\nsuccessively chapelmaster at Mayence and Berlin. In all these cases the\r\nincumbents were distinguished and very successful composers. Beethoven\r\nwas not. Wegeler’s words, “the chapelmaster and bass singer had at an\r\nearlier date produced operas at the National Theatre established by\r\nthe Elector,” have been rather interpreted than quoted by Schindler\r\nand others thus: “it is thought that under the luxury-loving Elector\r\nClemens August, he produced operas of his own composition”--a\r\nconstruction which is clearly forced and incorrect. Strange that so few\r\nwriters can content themselves with exact citations! Not only is there\r\nno proof whatever, certainly none yet made public, that Chapelmaster\r\nvan Beethoven was an author of operatic works, but the words in his own\r\npetition, “inasmuch as the Toxal must be sufficiently supplied with\r\n_musique_,” can hardly be otherwise understood than as intended to\r\nmeet a possible objection to his appointment on the ground of his not\r\nbeing a composer. Wegeler’s words, then, would simply mean that he put\r\nupon the stage and conducted the operatic works produced, which were\r\nneither numerous nor of a very high order during his time. His labors\r\nwere certainly onerous enough without adding musical composition. The\r\nrecords of the electoral court which have been described and in part\r\nreproduced in the preceding chapter, exhibit him conducting the music\r\nof chapel, theatre and “Toxal,” examining candidates for admission\r\ninto the electoral musical service, reporting upon questions referred\r\nto him by the privy council and the like, and all this in addition to\r\nhis services as bass singer, a position which gave him the principal\r\nbass parts and solos to sing both in chapel and theatre. Wegeler\r\nrecords a tradition that in Gassmann’s operetta “L’Amore Artigiano”\r\nand Monsigny’s “Déserteur” he was “admirable and received the highest\r\napplause.” If this be true it proves no small degree of enterprise on\r\nhis part as chapelmaster and of well-conserved powers as a singer; for\r\nthese two operas were first produced, the one in Vienna, the other in\r\nParis, in 1769, when Beethoven had already entered his fifty-eighth\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe words of Demmer in his petition of January 23, 1773, “the bass\r\nsinger van Beethoven is incapacitated and can no longer serve as such,”\r\nnaturally suggest the thought that the old gentleman’s appearance\r\nas _Brunoro_ in Lucchesi’s “L’Inganno scoperto” in May, 1773, was a\r\nfinal compliment to his master, the Elector, upon his birthday. He did\r\nnot live to celebrate another; the death of “Ludwig van Beethoven,\r\nHoffkapellmeister,” is recorded at Bonn under date of December 24,\r\n1773--one day after the sixty-first anniversary of his baptism in\r\nAntwerp.\r\n\r\nCHAPELMASTER VAN BEETHOVEN’S TRIALS\r\n\r\nAt home the good man had his cross to bear. His wife, Josepha, who with\r\none exception had buried all her children, and possibly on that very\r\naccount, became addicted to the indulgence of an appetite for strong\r\ndrink, was at the date of her husband’s death living as a boarder in a\r\ncloister at Cologne. How long she had been there does not appear, but\r\ndoubtless for a considerable period. The son, too, was married, but\r\nthough near was not in his father’s house. The separation was brought\r\nabout by his marriage, with which the father was not agreed. The house\r\nin which the chapelmaster died, and which he occupied certainly as\r\nearly as 1765, was that next north of the so-called Gudenauer Hof,\r\nlater the post-office in the neighboring Bonngasse, and bore the number\r\n386. The chapelmaster appears, upon pretty good evidence, to have\r\nremoved hither from the Fischer house in the Rheingasse, where he is\r\nsaid to have lived many years and even to have carried on a trade in\r\nwine, which change of dwelling may have taken place in 1767.\r\n\r\nWhen one recalls the imposing style of dress at the era the short,\r\nmuscular man, with dark complexion and very bright eyes, as Wegeler\r\ndescribes him[8] and as a painting by Courtpainter Radoux, still in\r\npossession of his descendants in Vienna, depicts him, presents quite an\r\nimposing picture to the imagination.\r\n\r\nOf the early life of Johann van Beethoven there are no particulars\r\npreserved except such as are directly or indirectly conveyed in the\r\nofficial documents. Such of these papers as came from his own hand, if\r\njudged by the standard of our time, show a want of ordinary education;\r\nbut it must not be forgotten that the orthography of the German\r\nlanguage was not then fixed; nor that many a contemporary of his, who\r\nboasted a university education, or who belonged to the highest ranks\r\nof society, wrote in a style no better than his. This is certain:\r\nthat after he had received an elementary education he was sent to the\r\n_Gymnasium_, for as a member of the lowest class (_infima_) of that\r\ninstitution he took part in September, 1750, as singer in the annual\r\nschool play which it was the custom of the _Musæ Bonnenses_ to give.\r\nIt would seem, therefore, that his good voice and musical gifts were\r\nappreciated at an early period. Herein, probably, is also to be found\r\nthe reason why his stay at the gymnasium was not of long duration.\r\nThe father had set him apart for service in the court music, and\r\nhimself, as appears from the statements already printed, undertook his\r\ninstruction; he taught him singing and clavier playing. Whether or not\r\nhe also taught him violin playing, in which he was “capable,” remains\r\nuncertain. In 1752, at the age of 12, as can be seen from his petition\r\nof March, 1756, and his father’s of 1764, he entered the chapel as\r\nsoprano. According to Gottwald’s report of 1756 he had served “about\r\n2 years”; the contradiction is probably explained by an interruption\r\ncaused by the mutation of his voice. At the age of 16, he received his\r\n_decretum_ as “accessist” on the score of his skill in singing and his\r\nexperience already acquired, including his capability on the violin,\r\nwhich was the basis of the decree of April 24, 1764, granting him a\r\nsalary of 100 rth. per annum.\r\n\r\nSo, at the age of 22, the young man received the promise of a salary,\r\nand at 24 obtained one of 100 thalers. In 1769, he received an increase\r\nof 25 fl., and 50 fl. more by the decree of April 3, 1772. He had,\r\nmoreover, an opportunity to gain something by teaching. Not only did\r\nhe give lessons in singing and clavier playing to the children of\r\nprominent families of the city, but he also frequently was called on to\r\nprepare young musicians for service in the chapel. Thus Demmer, says\r\nthe memorandum heretofore given, “paid 6 rth. to young Mr. Beethoven\r\nfor 3 months”; and a year later the following resolve of the privy\r\ncouncil was passed:\r\n\r\n     _Ad Suppl._ Joan Beethoven\r\n\r\n     The demands of the suppliant having been found to be correct, the\r\n     Electoral Treasury is commanded to satisfy the debt by the usual\r\n     withdrawal of the sum from the salary of the defendant.\r\n\r\n    Bonn, May 24, 1775.\r\n\r\n    Attest. P.\r\n\r\nwhich probably refers to a debt contracted by one of the women of the\r\ncourt chapel. A few years later, as we have seen, he seems to have\r\nbeen intrusted with the training of Johanna Helena Averdonck, whom he\r\nbrought forward as his pupil in March, 1778, and the singer Gazzenello\r\nwas his pupil before she went elsewhere. It was largely his own fault\r\nthat the musically gifted man was unfortunate in both domestic and\r\nofficial relations. His intemperance in drink, probably inherited from\r\nhis mother but attributed by old Fischer to the wine trade in which\r\nhis father embarked, made itself apparent at an early date, and by\r\nyielding to it more and more as he grew older he undoubtedly impaired\r\nhis voice and did much to bring about his later condition of poverty.\r\nHow it finally led to a catastrophe we shall see later. According to\r\nthe testimony of the widow Karth, he was a tall, handsome man, and wore\r\npowdered hair in his later years. Fischer does not wholly agree with\r\nher: “of medium height, longish face, broad forehead, round nose, broad\r\nshoulders, serious eyes, face somewhat scarred, thin pigtail.” Three\r\nand a half years after obtaining his salary of 100 th. he ventured to\r\nmarry. Heinrich Kewerich, the father of his wife, was head cook in\r\nthat palace at Ehrenbreitstein in which Clemens danced himself out of\r\nthis world, but he died before that event took place.[9] His wife, as\r\nthe church records testify, was Anna Clara Daubach. Her daughter Maria\r\nMagdalena, born December 19, 1746, married a certain Johann Laym,\r\nvalet of the Elector of Trèves, on January 30, 1763. On November 28,\r\n1765, the husband died, and Maria Magdalena was a widow before she had\r\ncompleted her 19th year. In a little less than two years the marriage\r\nregister of St. Remigius, at Bonn, was enriched by this entry:\r\n\r\nTHE PARENTS OF THE COMPOSER\r\n\r\n     _12ma 9bris. Praevia Dispensatione super 3bus denuntiationibus\r\n     copulavi D. Joannem van Beethoven, Dni. Ludovici van Beethoven\r\n     et Mariae Josephae Poll conjugum filium legitimum, et Mariam\r\n     Magdalenam Keferich viduam Leym ex Ehrenbreitstein, Henrici\r\n     Keferich et annae clarae Westorffs filiam legitimam. Coram\r\n     testibus Josepho clemente Belseroski et philippo Salomon._\r\n\r\nThat is, Johann van Beethoven has married the young widow Laym.\r\n\r\nHow it came that the marriage took place in Bonn instead of the home of\r\nthe bride we are told by Fischer. Chapelmaster van Beethoven was not\r\nat all agreed that his son should marry a woman of a lower station in\r\nlife than his own. He did not continue his opposition against the fixed\r\ndetermination of his son; but it is to be surmised that he would not\r\nhave attended a ceremony in Ehrenbreitstein, and hence the matter was\r\ndisposed of quickly in Bonn. After the wedding the young pair paid a\r\nvisit of a few days’ duration to Ehrenbreitstein.\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF MME. VAN BEETHOVEN\r\n\r\nFischer describes Madame van Beethoven as a “handsome, slender person”\r\nand tells of her “rather tall, longish face, a nose somewhat bent\r\n(_gehöffelt_, in the dialect of Bonn), spare, earnest eyes.” Cäcilia\r\nFischer could not recall that she had ever seen Madame van Beethoven\r\nlaugh; “she was always serious.” Her life’s vicissitudes may have\r\ncontributed to this disposition:--the early loss of her father, and of\r\nher first husband, and the death of her mother scarcely more than a\r\nyear after her second marriage. It is difficult to form a conception\r\nof her character because of the paucity of information about her.\r\nWegeler lays stress upon her piety and gentleness; her amiability\r\nand kindliness towards her family appear from all the reports;\r\nnevertheless, Fischer betrays the fact that she could be vehement\r\nin controversies with the other occupants of the house. “Madame van\r\nBeethoven,” Fischer continues, “was a clever woman; she could give\r\nconverse and reply aptly, politely and modestly to high and low, and\r\nfor this reason she was much liked and respected. She occupied herself\r\nwith sewing and knitting. They led a righteous and peaceful married\r\nlife, and paid their house-rent and baker’s bills promptly, quarterly,\r\nand on the day. She[10] was a good, a domestic woman, she knew how to\r\ngive and also how to take in a manner that is becoming to all people\r\nof honest thoughts.” From this it is fair to assume that she strove\r\nto conduct her household judiciously and economically; whether or not\r\nthis was always possible in view of the limited income, old Fischer\r\ndoes not seem to have been informed. She made the best she could of\r\nthe weaknesses of her husband without having been able to influence\r\nhim; her care for the children in externals was not wholly sufficient.\r\nYoung Ludwig clung to her with a tender love, more than to the father,\r\nwho was “only severe”; but there is nothing anywhere to indicate that\r\nshe exerted an influence upon the emotional life and development of\r\nher son, and in respect of this no wrong will be done her if the\r\nlower order of her culture be taken into consideration. Nor must it\r\nbe forgotten that in all probability she was naturally delicate and\r\nthat her health was still further weakened by her domestic troubles\r\nand frequent accouchements. The “quiet, suffering woman,” as Madame\r\nKarth calls her, died in 1787 of consumption at the age of 40 years.\r\nLong years after in Vienna Beethoven was wont, when among his intimate\r\nfriends, to speak of his “excellent” (_vortreffliche_) mother.[11]\r\n\r\nAt the time when Johann van Beethoven married, there was quite a colony\r\nof musicians, and other persons in the service of the court, in the\r\nBonngasse, as that street is in part named which extends from the\r\nlower extremity of the market-place to the Cologne gate. Chapelmaster\r\nvan Beethoven had left the house in the Rheingasse and lived at No.\r\n386. In the adjoining house, north, No. 387, lived the musical family\r\nRies. Farther down, the east house on that side of the way before the\r\nstreet assumes the name Kölnerstrasse was the dwelling of the hornist,\r\nafterward publisher, Simrock. Nearly opposite the chapelmaster’s the\r\nsecond story of the house No. 515 was occupied (but not till after\r\n1771) by the Salomons; the parterre and first floor by the owner of\r\nthe house, a lace-maker or dealer in laces, named Clasen. Of the two\r\nadjoining houses the one No. 576 was the dwelling of Johann Baum, a\r\nmaster locksmith, doubtless the Jean Courtin, “serrurier,” of the Court\r\nCalendar for 1773. In No. 617 was the family Hertel, twelve or fifteen\r\nyears later living under the Beethovens in the Wenzelgasse, and not far\r\noff a family, Poll, perhaps relations of Madame Beethoven the elder.\r\nConrad Poll’s name is found in the Court Calendars of the 1770’s as\r\none of the eight Electoral “Heiducken” (footmen). In 1767 in the rear\r\nof the Clasen house, north[12] there was a lodging to let; and there\r\nthe newly married Beethovens began their humble housekeeping. Their\r\nfirst child was a son, Ludwig Maria, baptized April 2, 1769, whose\r\nsponsors, as may be read in the register of St. Remigius parish, were\r\nthe grandfather Beethoven and Anna Maria Lohe, wife of Jean Courtin,\r\nthe next-door neighbor. This child lived but six days. In two years the\r\nloss of the parents was made up by the birth of him who is the subject\r\nof this biography.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] In Fétis’ “Biographie universelle” (new ed.) several of these names\r\nare misprinted. They are corrected here from Mr. Jacobs’ letter to A.\r\nW. T.\r\n\r\n[6] Thayer’s account of this period in the life of Beethoven’s\r\ngrandfather has here been extended from an article by the Chevalier\r\nL. de Burbure, published in the “Biographie nationale publiée par\r\nl’Académie Royale des sciences, des lettres et des beaux arts de\r\nBelgique.” Tome II. p. 105. (Brussels, 1868.) From this it further\r\nappears that two other members of the Antwerp branch of the family were\r\ndevoted to the fine arts, viz.: Peter van Beethoven, painter, pupil\r\nof Abr. Genoel, jr., and Gerhard van Beethoven, sculptor, accepted in\r\nthe guild of St. Luke about 1713, Director Vollmer, of Brussels, in a\r\ncommunication to Dr. Deiters gave information of a branch of the family\r\nin Mechlin and of still another in Brabant where, in the village of\r\nWambeke, there was a curé van Beethoven who must either have died or\r\nbeen transferred between 1729 and 1732.\r\n\r\n[7] The original entry is printed in full in the German edition of this\r\nbiography.\r\n\r\n[8] “The grandfather was a man short of stature, muscular, with\r\nextremely animated eyes, and was greatly respected as an artist.”\r\nFischer’s description is different, but Wegeler is the more trustworthy\r\nwitness of the two.\r\n\r\n[9] The church records at Ehrenbreitstein say that he died August\r\n2, 1759, in Molzberg, at the age of 58; his funeral took place\r\nin Ehrenbreitstein. A Frau Eva Katharina Kewerich, who died at\r\nEhrenbreitstein on October 10, 1753, at the age of 89 years, was\r\nprobably his mother.\r\n\r\n[10] Some notes by Fischer contain the characteristic addition: “Madame\r\nvan Beethoven once remarked that the most necessary things, such as\r\nhouse-rent, the baker, shoemaker and tailor must first be paid, but she\r\nwould never pay drinking debts.”\r\n\r\n[11] In the collection of Beethoven relics in the Beethoven House in\r\nBonn there is a portrait which is set down as that of Beethoven’s\r\nmother. The designation, however, rests only on uncertain tradition and\r\nlacks authoritative attestation. It is certainly difficult to see in it\r\nthe representation of a consumptive woman only 40 years old. Moreover,\r\nit is strange that Beethoven should have sent from Vienna for the\r\nportrait of his grandfather and not for that of his dearly loved mother\r\nhad one been in existence. It is only because of a resemblance between\r\nthis picture and another that the belief exists that portraits of both\r\nof the parents of Beethoven are in existence. In 1890 two oil portraits\r\nwere found in a shed in Cologne and restored by the painter Kempen, who\r\nrecognized in them the handiwork of the painter Beckenkamp, who, like\r\nBeethoven’s mother, was born in Ehrenbreitstein, was a visitor at the\r\nBeethoven home in Bonn and died in Cologne in 1828. The female portrait\r\nagrees with that in Bonn; they are life-size, finely executed pictures,\r\nbut they are certainly not Beethoven’s parents. Enough has been said\r\nabout the portrait of the mother. In the case of that of the father\r\nthe first objection is that it also lacks authentication. Fischer’s\r\ndescription does not wholly fit the picture; the old man would not\r\nhave forgotten the protruding lower lip. But the entire expression of\r\nthe face, serious, it is true, but fleshy and vulgar, and the gray\r\nperruque, do not conform to what we know of the easy-going musician. It\r\nwill be difficult, too, to trace any resemblance of expression between\r\nit and the familiar one of Beethoven from which a conclusion might be\r\ndrawn. So long as proofs are wanting, scientific biography will have\r\nno right to accept the portraits as those of Beethoven’s parents.\r\nReproductions of them may be found in the “Musical Times” of London,\r\nDecember 15, 1892.\r\n\r\n[12] The house is now owned by the Beethoven-Haus Verein, and\r\nmaintained as a Beethoven museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\n\r\n     The Childhood of Beethoven--An Inebriate Grandmother and\r\n     a Dissipated Father--The Family Homes in Bonn--The Boy’s\r\n     Schooling--His Music Teachers--Visits Holland with his Mother.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DATE OF BEETHOVEN’S BIRTH\r\n\r\nThere is no authentic record of Beethoven’s birthday. Wegeler, on the\r\nground of custom in Bonn, dates it the day preceding the ceremony of\r\nbaptism--an opinion which Beethoven himself seems to have entertained.\r\nIt is the official record of this baptism only that has been preserved.\r\nIn the registry of the parish of St. Remigius the entry appears as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    _Parentes_:\r\n    _D: Joannes van\r\n    Beethoven & Helena\r\n    Keverichs, conjuges_\r\n\r\n    _Proles_:\r\n    _17ma Xbris.\r\n    Ludovicus_\r\n\r\n    _Patrini_:\r\n    _D: Ludovicus van\r\n    Beethoven &\r\n    Gertrudis Müllers\r\n    dicta Baums_\r\n\r\nThe sponsors, therefore, were Beethoven’s grandfather the chapelmaster,\r\nand the wife of the next-door neighbor, Johann Baum, secretary at the\r\nelectoral cellar. The custom obtaining at the time in the Catholic\r\nRhine country not to postpone the baptism beyond 24 hours after the\r\nbirth of a child, it is in the highest degree probable that Beethoven\r\nwas born on December 16, 1770.[13]\r\n\r\nOf several certificates of baptism the following is copied in full for\r\nthe sake of a remark upon it written by the master’s own hand:\r\n\r\n    _Department de Rhin et Moselle\r\n    Mairie de Bonn._\r\n\r\n    _Extrait du Registre de Naissances de la Paroisse\r\n    de St. Remy à Bonn._\r\n\r\n     _Anno millesimo septingentesimo septuagesimo, de decima septima\r\n     Decembris baptizatus est Ludovicus. Parentes D: Joannes van\r\n     Beethoven et Helena[14] Keverichs, conjuges. Patrini, D: Ludovicus\r\n     van Beethoven et Gertrudis Müllers dicta Baums._\r\n\r\n    _Pour extrait conforme\r\n    délivré à la Mairie de Bonn._\r\n    _Bonn le 2 Juin, 1810._\r\n    [_Signatures and official seals._]\r\n\r\nOn the back of this paper Beethoven wrote:\r\n\r\n             “Es scheint der Taufschein nicht richtig,\r\n    1772     da noch ein Ludwig vor mir. Eine Baumgarten\r\n             war glaube ich mein Pathe.\r\n\r\n    Ludwig van Beethoven.”[15]\r\n\r\nThe composer, then, even in his fortieth year still believed the\r\ncorrect date to be 1772, which is the one given in all the old\r\nbiographical notices, and which corresponds to the dates affixed to\r\nmany of his first works, and indeed to nearly all allusions to his\r\nage in his early years. Only by keeping this fact in mind, can the\r\nlong list of chronological contradictions, which continually meet the\r\nstudent of his history during the first half of his life, be explained\r\nor comprehended. Whoever examines the original record of baptism in\r\nthe registry at Bonn, sees instantly that the certificate, in spite of\r\nBeethoven, is correct; but all possible doubt is removed by the words\r\nof Wegeler:\r\n\r\n     Little Louis clung to this grandfather ... with the greatest\r\n     affection, and, young as he was when he lost him, his early\r\n     impressions always remained lively. He liked to speak of his\r\n     grandfather with the friends of his youth, and his pious and\r\n     gentle mother, whom he loved much more than he did his father, who\r\n     was only severe, was obliged to tell him much of his grandfather.\r\n\r\nHad 1772 been the correct date the child could never have retained\r\npersonal recollections of a man who died on December 24, 1773. A\r\nsurvey of the whole ground renders the conclusion irresistible that at\r\nthe time when the boy began to attract notice by his skill upon the\r\npianoforte and by the promise of his first attempts in composition,\r\nhis age was purposely falsified, a motive for which may perhaps be\r\nfound in the excitement caused in the musical world by the then recent\r\ncareer of the Mozart children, and in the reflection that attainments\r\nwhich in a child of eight or ten years excite wonder and astonishment\r\nare considered hardly worthy of special remark in one a few years\r\nolder. There is, unfortunately, nothing known of Johann van Beethoven’s\r\ncharacter which renders such a trick improbable. Noteworthy is it that,\r\nat first, the falsification rarely extends beyond one year; and, also,\r\nthat in an official report in 1784 the correct age is given. Here an\r\nuntruth could not be risked, nor be of advantage if it had been.\r\n\r\nDr. C. M. Kneisel, who championed the cause of the house in the\r\nBonngasse in a controversy conducted in the “Kölnische Zeitung” in\r\n1845, touching the birthplace of Beethoven, remarks that the mother\r\n“was, as is known, a native of the Ehrenbreitstein valley and separated\r\nfrom her relatives; he (Johann van Beethoven) was without relatives and\r\nin somewhat straitened circumstances financially. What, then, was more\r\nnatural than that he should invite his neighbor, Frau Baum, a respected\r\nand well-to-do woman, _in whose house the baptismal feast was held_, to\r\nbe sponsor for his little son?” This last fact indicates clearly the\r\nnarrowness of the quarters in which the young couple dwelt. Does it\r\nnot also hint that the grandfather was now a solitary man with no home\r\nin which to spread the little feast? Let Johann van Beethoven himself\r\ndescribe the pecuniary condition in which he found himself upon the\r\ndeath of his father:\r\n\r\n    Most Reverend Archbishop,\r\n    Most Gracious Elector and Lord, Lord.\r\n\r\n     Will Your Electoral Grace graciously be pleased to hear that my\r\n     father has passed away from this world, to whom it was granted to\r\n     serve his Electoral Grace Clemens August and Your Electoral Grace\r\n     and gloriously reigning Lord Lord 42 years, as chapelmaster with\r\n     great honor, whose position I have been found capable of filling,\r\n     but nevertheless I would not venture to offer my capacity to Your\r\n     Electoral Grace, but since the death of my father has left me in\r\n     needy circumstances my salary not sufficing and I compelled to\r\n     draw on the savings of my father, my mother still living and in a\r\n     cloister at a cost of 60 rth. for board and lodging each year and\r\n     it is not advisable for me to take her to my home. Your Electoral\r\n     Grace is therefore humbly implored to make an allowance from the\r\n     400 rth. vacated for an increase of my salary so that I may not\r\n     need to draw upon the little savings and my mother may receive the\r\n     pension graciously for the few years which she may yet live, to\r\n     deserve which high grace it shall always be my striving.\r\n\r\n    Your Electoral Grace’s\r\n    Most humble and obedient\r\n    Servant and musicus jean van Beethoven.\r\n\r\nThere is something bordering on the comic in the coolness of the hint\r\nhere given that the petitioner would not object to an appointment as\r\nhis father’s successor, especially when it is remembered that Lucchesi\r\nand Mattioli were already in Bonn and the former had sufficiently\r\nproved his capacity by producing successful operas, both text and\r\nmusic, for the Elector’s delectation. The hint was not taken; what\r\nprovision was granted him, however, may be seen from a petition of\r\nJanuary 8, 1774, praying for an addition to his salary from that made\r\nvacant by the death of his father, and a pension to his mother who is\r\nkept at board in a cloister. A memorandum appears on the margin to the\r\neffect that the Elector graciously consents that the widow, so long as\r\nshe remains in the cloister, shall receive 60 rth. quarterly. Another\r\npetition of a year later has been lost, but its contents are indicated\r\nin the response, dated June 5, 1775, that Johann van Beethoven on the\r\ndeath of his mother shall have the enjoyment of the 60 rth. which had\r\nbeen granted her. The death of the mother followed a few months later\r\nand was thus announced in the “Intelligenzblatt” of Bonn on October 3,\r\n1775: “Died, on September 30, Maria Josepha Pals (_sic_), widow van\r\nBeethoven, aged 61 years.” In a list of salaries for 1776 (among the\r\npapers at Düsseldorf) for the “Musik Parthie” the salary of Johann van\r\nBeethoven is given at 36 rth. 45 alb. payable quarterly. The fact of\r\nthe great poverty in which he and his family lived is manifest from\r\nthe official documents (which confirm the many traditions to that\r\neffect) and from the more important recollections of aged people of\r\nBonn brought to light in a controversy concerning the birthplace of\r\nthe composer. For instance, Dr. Hennes, in his unsuccessful effort to\r\nestablish the claims of the Fischer house in the Rheingasse, says: “The\r\nlegacy left him (Johann van Beethoven) by his father did not last long.\r\nThat fine linen, which, as I was told, could be drawn through a ring,\r\nfound its way, piece by piece, out of the house; even the beautiful\r\nlarge portrait showing the father wearing a tasseled cap and holding a\r\nroll of music, went to the second-hand shop.” This is an error, though\r\nthe painting may have gone for a time to the pawnbroker.\r\n\r\nFrom the Bonngasse the Beethovens removed, when, is uncertain, to a\r\nhouse No. 7 or No. 8 on the left as one enters the Dreieckplatz in\r\npassing from the Sternstrasse to the Münsterplatz. They were living\r\nthere in 1774, for the baptism of another son on the 8th of April of\r\nthat year is recorded in the register of the parish of St. Gangolph,\r\nto which those houses belonged. This child’s name was Caspar Anton\r\nCarl, the first two names from his sponsor the Minister Belderbusch,\r\nthe third from Caroline von Satzenhofen, Abbess of Vilich. Was this\r\ncondescension on the part of the minister and the abbess intended to\r\nsoothe the father under the failure of his hopes of advancement? From\r\nthe Dreieckplatz the Beethovens migrated to the Fischer house, No. 934\r\nin the Rheingasse, so long held to be the composer’s birthplace and\r\nlong thereafter distinguished by a false inscription to that effect.\r\nWhether the removal took place in Ludwig’s fifth or sixth year is not\r\nknown; but at all events it was previous to the 2nd of October, 1776,\r\nfor upon that day another son of Johann van Beethoven was baptized in\r\nthe parish of St. Remigius by the name of Nicholas Johann. Dr. Hennes\r\nin his letter to the “Kölnische Zeitung” lays much stress upon the\r\ntestimony of Cäcilia Fischer. He says: “the maiden lady of 76 years,\r\nCäcilia Fischer, still remembers distinctly to have seen little Louis\r\nin his cradle and can tell many anecdotes about him, etc.” The mistake\r\nis easily explained without supposing any intentional deception:--62\r\nyears afterwards she mistook the birth of Nicholas Johann for that of\r\nLudwig. According to Fischer’s report the family removed from this\r\nhouse in 1776 for a short time to one in the Neugasse, but returned\r\nagain to the house in the Rheingasse after the palace fire in 1777.\r\nOne thought which suggests itself in relation to these removals of\r\nJohann van Beethoven may, perhaps, be more than mere fancy: that in\r\nexpectation of advancement in position upon the death of his father he\r\nhad exchanged the narrow quarters of the lodging in the rear of the\r\nClasen house for the much better dwelling in the Dreieckplatz; but upon\r\nthe failure of his hopes had been fain to seek a cheaper place in the\r\nlower part of the town down near the river.\r\n\r\nTHE BOY BEETHOVEN’S EARLY STUDY\r\n\r\nThere is nothing decisive as to the time when the musical education\r\nof Ludwig van Beethoven began, nor any positive evidence that he,\r\nlike Handel, Haydn or Mozart, showed remarkable genius for the art\r\nat a very early age. Schlosser has something on this point, but he\r\ngives no authorities, while the particulars which he relates could not\r\npossibly have come under his own observation. Müller[16] had heard\r\nfrom Franz Ries and Nicholas Simrock that Johann van Beethoven gave\r\nhis son instruction upon the pianoforte and violin “in his earliest\r\nchildhood.... To scarcely anything else did he hold him.” In the\r\ndedication of the pianoforte sonatas (1783) to the Elector, the boy\r\nis made to say: “Music became my first youthful pursuit in my fourth\r\nyear,” which might be supposed decisive on the point if his age were\r\nnot falsely given on the title-page. This much is certain: that after\r\nthe removal to the Fischer house the child had his daily task of\r\nmusical study and practice given him and in spite of his tears was\r\nforced to execute it. “Cäcilia Fischer,” writes Hennes (1838), “still\r\nsees him, a tiny boy, standing on a little footstool in front of the\r\nclavier to which the implacable severity of his father had so early\r\ncondemned him. The patriarch of Bonn, Head Burgomaster Windeck, will\r\npardon me if I appeal to him to say that he, too, saw the little Louis\r\nvan Beethoven in this house standing in front of the clavier and\r\nweeping.” To this writes Dr. Wegeler:\r\n\r\n     I saw the same thing. How? The Fischer house was, perhaps still\r\n     is, connected by a passage-way in the rear with a house in the\r\n     Giergasse, which was then occupied by the owner, a high official\r\n     of the Rhenish revenue service, Mr. Bachen, grandfather of Court\r\n     Councillor Bachen of this city. The youngest son of the latter,\r\n     Benedict, was my schoolmate, and on my visits to him the doings\r\n     and sufferings of Louis were visible from the house.\r\n\r\nIt must be supposed that the father had seen indications of his\r\nson’s genius, for it is difficult to imagine such an one remaining\r\nunperceived; but the necessities of the family with the failure of the\r\npetition for a better salary--sent in just at the time when the Elector\r\nwas so largely increasing his expenditures for music by the engagement\r\nof Lucchesi and Mattioli and in other ways--are sufficient reasons for\r\nthe inflexible severity with which the boy was kept at his studies. The\r\ndesire to say something new and striking on the part of many who have\r\nwritten about Beethoven has led to such an admixture of fact and fancy\r\nthat it is now very difficult to separate them. One (Schlosser) tells\r\nhis readers that “the greatest joy of the lad was when his father took\r\nhim upon his knees and permitted him to accompany a song on the clavier\r\nwith his tiny fingers,” while others tell the tale of his childhood\r\nin a manner to convey the idea that the father was a pitiless tyrant,\r\nthe boy a victim and a slave--an error which a calm consideration of\r\nwhat is really known of the facts in the case at once dispels. There\r\nis but one road to excellence, even for the genius of a Handel or a\r\nMozart--unremitted application. To this young Ludwig was compelled,\r\nsometimes, no doubt, through the fear or the actual infliction of\r\npunishment for neglect; sometimes, too, the father, whose habits were\r\nsuch as to favor a bad interpretation of his conduct, was no doubt\r\nharsh and unjust. And such seems to be the truth. At any rate, the boy\r\nat an early date acquired so considerable a facility upon the clavier\r\nthat his father could have him play at court and when he was seven\r\nyears old produce him with one of his pupils at a concert in Bonn.\r\nHere is the announcement of the concert as it was reproduced in the\r\n“Kölnische Zeitung” of December 18, 1870, from the original:\r\n\r\n     AVERTISSEMENT\r\n\r\n     To-day, March 26, 1778, in the musical concert-room in the\r\n     Sternengasse the Electoral Court Tenorist, Beethoven, will have\r\n     the honor to produce two of his scholars, namely, Mlle. Averdonck,\r\n     Court Contraltist, and his little son of six years. The former\r\n     will have the honor to contribute various beautiful arias, the\r\n     latter various clavier concertos and trios. He flatters himself\r\n     that he will give complete enjoyment to all ladies and gentlemen,\r\n     the more since both have had the honor of playing to the greatest\r\n     delight of the entire Court.\r\n\r\n     Beginning at five o’clock in the evening.\r\n\r\n     Ladies and gentlemen who have not subscribed will be charged a\r\n     florin. Tickets may be had at the aforesaid Akademiesaal, also of\r\n     Mr. Claren auf der Bach in Mühlenstein.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we learn nothing concerning the pieces played by the boy\r\nnor of the success of his performance. That the violin as well as the\r\npianoforte was practised by him is implicitly confirmed by the terms\r\nin which Schindler records his denial of the truth of the well-known\r\nspider story: “The great Ludwig refused to remember any such incident,\r\nmuch as the tale amused him. On the contrary, he said it was more to be\r\nexpected that everything would have fled from his scraping, even flies\r\nand spiders.”\r\n\r\nPAUCITY OF INTELLECTUAL TRAINING\r\n\r\nThe father’s main object being the earliest and greatest development\r\nof his son’s musical genius so as to make it a “marketable commodity,”\r\nhe gave him no other school education than such as was afforded in\r\none of the public schools. Fischer says he first attended a school in\r\nthe Neugasse taught by a man named Huppert[17] and thence went to the\r\nMünsterschule. Among the lower grade schools in Bonn was the so-called\r\nTirocinium, a Latin school, which prepared pupils for the gymnasium but\r\nwas not directly connected with it, but had its own corps of teachers,\r\nlike the whole educational system of the period, under the supervision\r\nof the Academic Council established by Max Friedrich in 1777. The\r\npupils learned, outside of the elementary studies (arithmetic and\r\nwriting are said to have been excluded), to read and write Latin up to\r\nan understanding of Cornelius Nepos. Johann Krengel, a much respected\r\npedagogue, was teacher at the time and was appointed municipal\r\nschoolmaster in 1783 by the Academic Council. In 1786 he transferred\r\nthe school to the Bonngasse. To this school young Beethoven was sent;\r\nwhen, is uncertain. His contemporary and schoolfellow Wurzer, Electoral\r\nCouncillor and afterwards president of the Landgericht, relates the\r\nfollowing in his memoirs:[18]\r\n\r\n     One of my schoolmates under Krengel was Luis van Beethoven, whose\r\n     father held an appointment as court singer under the Elector.\r\n     Apparently his mother was already dead at the time,[19] for Luis\r\n     v. B. was distinguished by uncleanliness, negligence, etc. Not a\r\n     sign was to be discovered in him of that spark of genius which\r\n     glowed so brilliantly in him afterwards. I imagine that he was\r\n     kept down to his musical studies from an early age by his father.\r\n\r\nWurzer entered the gymnasium in 1781; Beethoven did not. This,\r\ntherefore, must have been the time at which all other studies were\r\nabandoned in favor of music. In what manner his education was otherwise\r\npieced out is not to be learned. The lack of proper intellectual\r\ndiscipline is painfully obvious in Beethoven’s letters throughout his\r\nlife. In his early manhood he wrote a fair hand, so very different from\r\nthe shocking scrawl of his later years as to make one almost doubt the\r\ngenuineness of autographs of that period; but in orthography, the use\r\nof capital letters, punctuation and arithmetic he was sadly deficient\r\nall his life long. He was still able to use the French tongue at a\r\nlater period, and of Latin he had learned enough to understand the\r\ntexts which he composed; but even as a schoolboy his studies appear to\r\nhave been made second to his musical practice with which his hours out\r\nof school were apparently for the most part occupied. He was described\r\nby Dr. Müller as “a shy and taciturn boy, the necessary consequence of\r\nthe life apart which he led, observing more and pondering more than\r\nhe spoke, and disposed to abandon himself entirely to the feelings\r\nawakened by music and (later) by poetry and to the pictures created\r\nby fancy.” Of those who were his schoolfellows and who in after years\r\nrecorded their reminiscences of him, not one speaks of him as a\r\nplayfellow, none has anecdotes to relate of games with him, rambles on\r\nthe hills or adventures upon the Rhine and its shores in which he bore\r\na part. Music and ever music; hence the power of clothing his thoughts\r\nin words was not developed by early culture, and the occasional bursts\r\nof eloquence in his letters and recorded conversations are held not to\r\nbe genuine, because so seldom found. As if the strong mind, struggling\r\nfor adequate expression, should not at times break through all barriers\r\nand overcome all obstacles![20] Urged forward thus by the father’s\r\nseverity, by his tender love for his mother and by the awakening of his\r\nown tastes, the development of his skill and talents was rapid; so much\r\nso that in his ninth year a teacher more competent than his father was\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN AND VAN DEN EEDEN\r\n\r\nThe first to whom his father turned was the old court organist van den\r\nEeden, who had been in the electoral service about fifty years and had\r\ncome to Bonn before the arrival there of Ludwig van Beethoven, the\r\ngrandfather. One can easily imagine his willingness to serve an old\r\nand deceased friend by fitting his grandson to become his successor;\r\nand this might account for Schlosser’s story that at first he taught\r\nhim gratis, and that he continued his instructions at the command and\r\nexpense of the Elector. The story may or may not be true, but nothing\r\nhas been discovered in the archives at Düsseldorf confirming the\r\nstatement; in fact concerning the time, the subjects and the results\r\nof van den Eeden’s instruction we are thrown largely upon conjecture.\r\n“In his eighth year,” says Mäurer in his notices, “Court Organist\r\nvan den Eeden took him as a pupil; nothing has been learned of his\r\nprogress.” This, if Mäurer was correct in stating his age, would have\r\nbeen about 1778. It is after this that Mäurer refers to his study under\r\nPfeiffer. Independently of all this Fischer says: “His father not being\r\nable to teach him more in music, and suspecting that he had talent\r\nfor composition, took him at first to an aged master named Santerrini\r\nwho instructed him for a while; but the father thought little of this\r\nteacher, did not consider him the right man and desired a change.”\r\nThis desire resulted in securing Pfeiffer through the mediation of\r\nGrossmann. There was no musician Santerrini in the court chapel, but an\r\nactor, named Santorini, was a member of Grossmann’s troupe; he cannot\r\nbe considered in this connection. There is evidently a confusion of\r\nnames, and the whole context, especially the reference to the “aged\r\nmaster,” shows that no other than van den Eeden was meant by the\r\nteacher who gave instruction for a short time before Pfeiffer.\r\n\r\nSchlosser does not say that this instruction was on the organ and\r\nit is unlikely that the boy, who was destined for a more systematic\r\ninstruction in pianoforte playing, was put at the organ at so early\r\nan age. It was a deduction, probably, from the fact that van den\r\nEeden was an organist and that later Beethoven displayed a great deal\r\nof dexterity upon that instrument. It is noteworthy that Wegeler\r\n(p. 11) says nothing definite as to whether or not Beethoven took\r\nlessons from van den Eeden; he merely thought it likely, because he\r\nknew no one else in Bonn from whom Beethoven could have learned the\r\ntechnical handling of the organ. But there were several such in Bonn\r\nirrespective of Neefe. Schindler makes certainty out of Wegeler’s\r\nconjecture and relates that Beethoven often spoke of the old organist\r\nwhen discoursing upon the proper position and movement of the body\r\nand hands in organ and pianoforte playing, he having been taught to\r\nhold both calm and steady, to play in the connected style of Handel\r\nand Bach. This may have been correct so far as pianoforte playing is\r\nconcerned; but Schindler had little knowledge of Beethoven’s Bonn\r\nperiod, and the possibility of a confusion of names is not excluded\r\neven on the part of Beethoven himself, who received hints from several\r\norganists. Mäurer, after speaking of Pfeiffer, continues as follows:\r\n“Van den Eeden remained his only teacher in thorough-bass. As a man of\r\nseventy he sent the boy Louis, between eleven and twelve years old, to\r\naccompany the mass and other church music on the organ. His playing\r\nwas so astonishing that one was forced to believe he had intentionally\r\nconcealed his gifts. While preluding for the _Credo_ he took a theme\r\nfrom the movement and developed it to the amazement of the orchestra so\r\nthat he was permitted to improvise longer than is customary. That was\r\nthe opening of his brilliant career.” Mäurer seems to know nothing of\r\nNeefe when he says that van den Eeden was Beethoven’s only teacher in\r\nthorough-bass. What he says, too, about the lad’s performance at the\r\norgan as substitute obviously rests upon a confounding of van den Eeden\r\nwith another of Beethoven’s organ teachers--most likely Neefe.\r\n\r\nIt is our conjecture that van den Eeden taught the boy chiefly and\r\nperhaps exclusively pianoforte playing, he being a master in that art;\r\nbut his influence was small. It must be remembered that van den Eeden\r\nwas a very old man, as whose successor Neefe had been chosen in 1781,\r\nand who died in June, 1782. Nowhere does he, like the other teachers\r\nof Beethoven, disclose individual traits; he is a totally colorless\r\npicture in the history of Beethoven’s youth. Nor does it appear that\r\nthere was any intimacy between him and the Beethoven family, since\r\notherwise he would not have been missing in the notices of Fischer,\r\nwho does not even know his name. The judgment of the father that his\r\ninstruction was inefficient was probably correct.\r\n\r\nOTHER TEACHERS OF THE BOY BEETHOVEN\r\n\r\nA fitter master, it was thought, was obtained in Tobias Friedrich\r\nPfeiffer, who came to Bonn in the summer of 1779, as tenor singer in\r\nGrossmann and Helmuth’s theatrical company. Mäurer, the violoncellist,\r\nin some reminiscences of that period communicated to this work by\r\nProfessor Jahn, says that Pfeiffer was a skillful pianist and gave the\r\nboy lessons, but not at any regular hours. Often when he came with\r\nBeethoven, the father, from the wine-house late at night, the boy was\r\nroused from sleep and kept at the pianoforte until morning;--a course\r\nnot particularly favorable to his progress at school, but one which\r\nmay be readily credited in the light of what is known of Pfeiffer and\r\nJohann Beethoven, and one, moreover, which would cause the lessons\r\nto make an enduring impression upon the memory. There is some reason\r\nto think that the former was an inmate of the latter’s family, which\r\nadds probability to the story. Although Pfeiffer was in Bonn but one\r\nyear, Wegeler affirms that “Beethoven owed most of all to this teacher,\r\nand was so appreciative of the fact that he sent him financial help\r\nfrom Vienna through Simrock.” To what extent Wegeler’s opinion as to\r\nBeethoven’s obligations is correct, it would be difficult to decide;\r\nbut the utter improbability that a single year’s lessons from this\r\nman would profit a boy eight and a half to nine and a half years old,\r\nmore than those from any other of his teachers, much longer and\r\nsystematically continued, is manifest. About this time the young court\r\nmusician Franz Georg Rovantini lived in the same house with Beethoven.\r\nHe was the son of a violinist Johann Conrad Rovantini who had been\r\ncalled to Bonn from Ehrenbreitstein and who died in 1766. He was\r\nrelated to the Beethoven family. The young musician was much respected\r\nand sought after as teacher. According to the Fischer document the\r\nboy Beethoven was among his pupils, taking lessons on the violin and\r\nviola. But these lessons, too, came to an early end; Rovantini died on\r\nSeptember 9, 1781, aged 24.\r\n\r\nA strong predilection for the organ was awakened early in the\r\nlad and he eagerly sought opportunities to study the instrument,\r\napparently even before he became Neefe’s pupil. In the cloister of the\r\nFranciscan monks at Bonn there lived a friar named Willibald Koch,\r\nhighly respected for his playing and his expert knowledge of organ\r\nconstruction. We have no reason to doubt that young Ludwig sought him\r\nout, received instruction from him and made so much progress that\r\nFriar Willibald accepted him as assistant. In the same way he made\r\nfriends with the organist in the cloister of the Minorites and “made an\r\nagreement” to play the organ there at 6 o’clock morning mass. It would\r\nseem that he felt the need of familiarity with a larger organ than that\r\nof the Franciscans. On the inside of the cover of a memorandum book\r\nwhich he carried to Vienna with him is found the note: “Measurements\r\n(_Fussmass_) of the Minorite pedals in Bonn.” Plainly he had kept an\r\ninterest in the organ. Still another tradition is preserved in a letter\r\nto the author from Miss Auguste Grimm, dated September, 1872, to the\r\neffect that Heinrich Theisen, born in 1759, organist at Rheinbreitbach\r\nnear Honneck on the Rhine, studied the organ in company with Beethoven\r\nunder Zenser, organist of the Münsterkirche at Bonn, and that the lad\r\nof ten years surpassed his fellow student of twenty. The tradition\r\nsays that already at that time Ludwig composed pieces which were too\r\ndifficult for his little hands. “Why, you can’t play that, Ludwig,” his\r\nteacher is said to have remarked, and the boy to have replied: “I will\r\nwhen I am bigger.”\r\n\r\nWhen Beethoven’s studies with van den Eeden began and ended,\r\nwhether they were confined to the organ or pianoforte, or partook\r\nof both--these are undecided points. It does not appear that any\r\ninstruction in composition was given him until he became the pupil\r\nof Neefe. In the _facsimile_ which follows the part devoted to\r\nthorough-bass in the so-called “Studien,” the composer says: “Dear\r\nFriends: I took the pains to learn this only that I might write the\r\nfigures readily and later instruct others; for myself I never had\r\nto learn how to avoid errors, for from my childhood I had so keen a\r\nsensibility that I wrote correctly without knowing it had to be so,\r\nor could be otherwise.” This lends plausibility, at least, to another\r\nanecdote related by Mäurer concerning an alleged precocious composition\r\nby Beethoven:\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF A FIRST COMPOSITION\r\n\r\n     About this time the English Ambassador to the Elector’s court,\r\n     named Kressner, who had extended help to the Beethoven family,\r\n     living scantily on a salary of 400 fl. [?], died. Louis composed\r\n     a funeral cantata to his memory--his first composition. He handed\r\n     his score to Lucchesi and asked him to correct the errors.\r\n     Lucchesi gave it back with the remark that he could not understand\r\n     it, and therefore could not comply with his request, but would\r\n     have it performed. At the first rehearsal there was great\r\n     astonishment at the originality of the composition, but approval\r\n     was divided; after a few rehearsals the approbation grew and the\r\n     piece was performed with general applause.\r\n\r\nGeorge Cressener came to Bonn in the autumn of 1755, and died there\r\nJanuary 17, 1781, in the eighty-first year of his age. The “about this\r\ntime” in Mäurer’s story agrees, therefore, well enough with that date;\r\nit is, however, a suspicious circumstance that Mäurer had left the\r\nservice and returned to Cologne in the Spring of 1780 and, therefore,\r\nwas not eye-witness to the fact; and another that the circumstance\r\nwas not remembered by other members of the court chapel, not even by\r\nFranz Ries, nor by Neefe, who, though not then a member, was already\r\nin Bonn. “In 1780,” continues Mäurer, “Beethoven got acquainted with\r\nZambona, who called his attention to his neglected education, gave\r\nhim lessons daily in Latin, Louis continuing a year (in six weeks he\r\nread Cicero’s letters!)--also logic, French and Italian--until Zambona\r\nleft Bonn in order to become bookkeeper for Bartholdy in Mühlheim.” In\r\nthe “Geheime Staats-Conferenz Protocollen,” May 20, 1787, one reads:\r\n“Stephan Zambona prays to be appointed, _Kammerportier_, etc.,” to\r\nwhich is appended the remark: “the request not granted.” Zambona is a\r\nname, too, which, half a dozen years later, often appears in the Bonn\r\n“Intelligenzblatt,” as that of a shopkeeper in the Market Place of that\r\ntown. If the story of the cantata be doubtful, that of these private\r\nstudies on the part of a boy in Beethoven’s position, only in his tenth\r\nyear and a schoolboy then if ever, like Hamlet’s possible dreams in the\r\nsleep of death, must “give us pause.”\r\n\r\nMother and son undertook a voyage to Holland in the beginning of the\r\nwinter of 1781. The widow Karth, one of the Hertel family, born in 1780\r\nand still living in Bonn in 1861, passed her childhood in the house No.\r\n462 Wenzelgasse in the upper story of which the Beethovens then lived.\r\nOne of her reminiscences is in place here. She distinctly remembered\r\nsitting, when a child, upon her own mother’s knee, and hearing Madame\r\nvan Beethoven--“a quiet, suffering woman”--relate that when she went\r\nwith her little boy Ludwig to Holland it was so cold on the boat\r\nthat she had to hold his feet in her lap to prevent them from being\r\nfrostbitten; and also that, while absent, Ludwig played a great deal\r\nin great houses, astonished people by his skill and received valuable\r\npresents. The circumstance of the cold feet warmed in the mother’s lap,\r\nis precisely one to fasten itself in the memory of a child and form a\r\npoint around which other facts might cluster.[21]\r\n\r\nAnother incident related in connection with this journey to\r\nHolland--not as a fact, but as one which she had heard spoken of in her\r\nchildhood--and one very difficult to comprehend, is, that some person,\r\nwhether an envious boy or a heartless adult she could not tell, drew a\r\nknife across the fingers of Ludwig to disable him from playing!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] In one of Beethoven’s conversation books his nephew writes on\r\nDecember 15, 1823: “To-day is the 15th of December, the day of your\r\nbirth, but I am not sure whether it is the 15th or 17th, inasmuch as we\r\ncan not depend on the certificate of baptism and I read it only once\r\nwhen I was still with you in January.” The nephew, it will be observed,\r\ndoes not appeal to a family tradition but to the baptismal certificate\r\nand the uncertainty, therefore, is with reference to the date of\r\nbaptism, not of birth. Hence the deduction which Kalischer makes\r\n(“Vossische Zeitung,” No. 17, 1891) that Beethoven was born on December\r\n15. Hesse calls to witness a clerk employed in Simrock’s establishment\r\nwith whom Beethoven had business transactions, and who had written on\r\nthe back of the announcement of Beethoven’s death, “L. v. Beethoven was\r\nborn on December 16, 1770.”\r\n\r\n[14] The mistake in the mother’s name is sufficiently explained by the\r\nuse of Lena as the contraction of both Helena and Magdalena.\r\n\r\n[15] “The baptismal certificate seems to be incorrect, since there was\r\na Ludwig born before me. A Baumgarten was my sponsor, I believe. Ludwig\r\nvan Beethoven.”\r\n\r\n[16] “Allg. Mus.-Ztg.,” May 23. 1827.\r\n\r\n[17] There was no teacher of this name in Bonn at the time. There was a\r\nRupert, however, who may have been the one meant by Fischer.\r\n\r\n[18] These memoirs are in manuscript. They were formerly in the\r\npossession of Dr. Bodifée of Bonn, later in the Town Hall.\r\n\r\n[19] Error; Beethoven’s mother did not die until 1787, long after he\r\nhad left school.\r\n\r\n[20] Thayer’s characterization of the joyless boyhood of Beethoven\r\nmay submit to a slight modification, at least so far as his childhood\r\nis concerned, without violence to the verities of history. Fischer\r\nwould have us believe that the lad took part with his brother Carl\r\nin boyish capers which were not always of a harmless character. In a\r\nletter to Simrock, Court Councillor Krupp relates: “My father, who\r\ndied in 1847, was a youthful friend and schoolmate of Ludwig and Carl\r\nvan Beethoven, and distantly related to the godmother of the former.\r\nThursdays were holidays for the schoolboys, and the brothers Beethoven,\r\nL. and C., were then wont to come to the house of my grandparents, No.\r\n28 Bonngasse (now belonging to my sister and me), and amuse themselves,\r\namong other things, with target shooting. There was a wall between\r\nthe garden of our house and the gardens of the adjoining houses in\r\nthe Wenzelgasse against which the target was placed at which the boys\r\nshot arrows; a hit in the centre brought forth a _Stüber_ (about 4\r\npfennigs) for the lucky marksman. Garden and wall are now (1890) in\r\nthe same condition as then. In the evening the Beethoven brothers went\r\nhome through the Gudenauergässchen. The family lived at the time in the\r\nWenzelgasse back of our house.” Here is an inaccuracy, for Ludwig van\r\nBeethoven no longer went to school when the Beethoven family changed\r\ntheir house in the Rheingasse for that in the Wenzelgasse--which was\r\nprobably about 1785. The letter continues: “Ludwig’s father treated him\r\nharshly, especially when he was intoxicated, and sometimes shut him up\r\nin the cellar.”\r\n\r\n[21] There seems to have been no knowledge on the part of Beethoven’s\r\nbiographers of this visit to Holland until Thayer brought the incident\r\nto notice. It is, therefore, highly significant that the Fischer\r\nfamily also recalled the circumstance and, besides, knew what brought\r\nit about. The sister of young Rovantini, who died in September, 1781,\r\nwas employed as governess in Rotterdam, and on receiving intelligence\r\nof the death of her brother came to Bonn, together with her mistress\r\n(whose name has not been preserved), to visit his grave. For a month\r\nshe was an inmate of the Beethoven house; there was a good deal of\r\nmusic-making and some excursions to neighboring places of interest,\r\nincluding Coblenz. The visitors invited the Beethoven family to make a\r\ntrip to Holland. Inasmuch as Johann van Beethoven could not get away,\r\nthe mother went with the lad, and, a party of five, they embarked upon\r\nthe voyage. This must have been in October or November, 1781, which\r\nagrees with the story of the extreme cold encountered on the voyage.\r\nThey remained a considerable time, but whether or not Ludwig gave\r\na concert as he had intended, is not known. Despite the attentions\r\nshowered upon him by the wealthy lady from Rotterdam and the many\r\nhonors, the pecuniary results were disappointing. To Fischer’s question\r\nhow he had fared Beethoven is reported to have answered: “The Dutch are\r\nskinflints (_Pfennigfuchser_); I’ll never go to Holland again.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\n\r\n     Beethoven a Pupil of Neefe--His Talent and Skill Put to Use--First\r\n     Efforts at Composition--Johann van Beethoven’s Family--Domestic\r\n     Tribulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nChristian Gottlob Neefe succeeded the persons mentioned as Beethoven’s\r\nmaster in music. When this tutorship began and ended, and whether or\r\nnot it be true that the Elector engaged and paid him for his services\r\nin this capacity, as affirmed by divers writers--here again positive\r\nevidence is wanting. Neefe came to Bonn in October, 1779; received the\r\ndecree of succession to the position of Court Organist on February 15,\r\n1781, and was thus permanently engaged in the Elector’s service. The\r\nunsatisfactory nature of the earlier instruction, as well as the high\r\nreputation of Neefe, placed in the strongest light before the Bonn\r\npublic by those proceedings which had compelled him to remain there,\r\nwould render it highly desirable to Johann van Beethoven to transfer\r\nhis son to the latter’s care. It would create no surprise should proof\r\nhereafter come to light that this change was made even before the\r\nissue of the decree of February 15, 1781;--that even then the pupil\r\nwas profiting by the lessons of the zealous Bachist. Whether this was\r\nso or not, it was more than ever necessary that the boy’s talents\r\nshould be put to profitable use, for the father found his family still\r\nincreasing. The baptism of a daughter named Anna Maria Franciska after\r\nher sponsors Anna Maria Klemmers, _dicta_ Kochs, and Franz Rovantini,\r\ncourt musician, is recorded in the St. Remigius register February 23,\r\n1779, and her death on the 27th of the same month. The baptism of\r\nAugust Franciscus Georgius van Beethoven--Franz Rovantini, _Musicus\r\nAulicus_ and Helene Averdonk, _patrini_, follows nearly two years\r\nlater--January 17, 1781. There is no minister of State now to lend\r\nhis name to a child of Johann van Beethoven, nor any lady abbess.\r\nRovantini, one of the youngest members of the orchestra (relative\r\nand friend of the family), and a Frau Kochs, the young contralto,\r\nwhose musical education the father had superintended, take their\r\nplaces--another indication that the head of the family is gradually\r\nsinking in social position.\r\n\r\nIt is Schlosser who states that “the Elector urged Neefe to make it his\r\nparticular care to look after the training of the young Beethoven.” How\r\nmuch weight is to be attached to this assertion of a man who hastily\r\nthrew a few pages together soon after the death of the composer, and\r\nwho begins by adopting the old error of 1772 as the date of his birth,\r\nand naming his father “Anton,” may safely be left to the reader. That\r\nthe story may possibly have some foundation in truth is not denied; but\r\nthe probabilities are all against it. Just in these years Max Friedrich\r\nis busy with his tric-trac, his balls, his new operettas and comedies,\r\nand with his notion of making the theatre a school of morals. The\r\ntruth seems to be (and it is the only hypothesis that suggests itself,\r\ncorresponding to the established facts), that Johann van Beethoven had\r\nnow determined to make an organist of his son as the surest method of\r\nmaking his talents productive. The appointment of Neefe necessarily\r\ndestroyed Ludwig’s hope of being van den Eeden’s successor; but Neefe’s\r\nother numerous employments would make an assistant indispensable,\r\nand to this place the boy might well aspire. It will be seen in the\r\ncourse of the narrative that Beethoven never had a warmer, kinder and\r\nmore valuable friend than Neefe proved throughout the remainder of\r\nhis Bonn life; that, in fact, his first appointment was obtained for\r\nhim through Neefe, although this is the first hint yet published that\r\nthe credit does not belong to a very different personage. What, then,\r\nso natural, so self-evident as that Neefe, foreseeing the approaching\r\nnecessity of some one to take charge of the little organ in the chapel\r\nat times when his duties to the Grossmann company would prevent him\r\nfrom officiating in person, should gladly undertake the training of the\r\nremarkable talents of van den Eeden’s pupil with no wish for any other\r\nremuneration than the occasional services which the youth could render\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nNEEFE’S INFLUENCE ON BEETHOVEN\r\n\r\nDr. Wegeler remarks: “Neefe had little influence upon the instruction\r\nof our Ludwig, who frequently complained of the too severe criticisms\r\nmade on his first efforts in composition.” The first of these\r\nassertions is evidently an utter mistake. In 1793 Beethoven himself,\r\nat all events, thought differently: “I thank you for the counsel\r\nwhich you gave me so often in my progress in my divine art. If I ever\r\nbecome a great man yours shall be a share of the credit. This will\r\ngive you the greater joy since you may rest assured,” etc. Thus he\r\nwrote to his old teacher. As to the complaint of harsh criticism it\r\nmay be remarked that Neefe, reared in the strict Leipsic school, must\r\nhave been greatly dissatisfied with the direction which the young\r\ngenius was taking under the influences which surrounded him, and that\r\nhe should labor to change its course. He was still a young man, and\r\nin his zeal for his pupil’s progress may well have criticized his\r\nchildish compositions with a severity which, though no more than just\r\nand reasonable, may have so contrasted with injudicious praise from\r\nother quarters as to wound the boy’s self-esteem and leave a sting\r\nbehind; especially if Neefe indulged in a tone at all contemptuous, a\r\ncommon fault of young men in like cases. Probably, in some conversation\r\nupon this point Beethoven may have remarked to Wegeler that Neefe had\r\ncriticized him in his childhood rather too severely.\r\n\r\nBut to return from the broad field of hypothesis to the narrow path of\r\nfacts. “On this day, June 20, 1782,” Neefe writes of himself and the\r\nGrossmann company, “we entered upon our journey to Münster, whither\r\nthe Elector also went. The day before my predecessor, Court Organist\r\nvan den Eeden, was buried; I received permission, however, to leave my\r\nduties in the hands of a vicar and go along to Westphalia and thence\r\nto the Michaelmas fair at Frankfort.” The Düsseldorf documents prove\r\nthat this vicar was Ludwig van Beethoven, now just eleven and a half\r\nyears of age. In the course of the succeeding winter, Neefe prepared\r\nthat very valuable and interesting communication to “Cramer’s Magazine”\r\nwhich has been so largely quoted. In this occurs the first printed\r\nnotice of Beethoven, one which is honorable to head and heart of its\r\nauthor. He writes, under date of March 2, 1783:\r\n\r\n     Louis van Beethoven, son of the tenor singer mentioned, a boy\r\n     of eleven years and of most promising talent. He plays the\r\n     clavier very skilfully and with power, reads at sight very well,\r\n     and--to put it in a nutshell--he plays chiefly “The Well-Tempered\r\n     Clavichord” of Sebastian Bach, which Herr Neefe put into his\r\n     hands. Whoever knows this collection of preludes and fugues in all\r\n     the keys--which might almost be called the _non plus ultra_ of our\r\n     art--will know what this means. So far as his duties permitted,\r\n     Herr Neefe has also given him instruction in thorough-bass. He is\r\n     now training him in composition and for his encouragement has had\r\n     nine variations for the pianoforte, written by him on a march--by\r\n     Ernst Christoph Dressler--engraved at Mannheim. This youthful\r\n     genius is deserving of help to enable him to travel. He would\r\n     surely become a second Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart were he to continue\r\n     as he has begun.\r\n\r\nThis allusion to Mozart, who had not then produced those immortal works\r\nupon which his fame now principally rests, speaks well for the insight\r\nof Neefe and renders his high appreciation of his pupil’s genius the\r\nmore striking. Had this man then really so little influence upon its\r\ndevelopment as Wegeler supposed?\r\n\r\nThat C. P. E. Bach’s works were included in Neefe’s course of\r\ninstruction is rendered nearly certain by the following facts: he was\r\nhimself a devout student of them; the only reference to his father\r\nmade by Beethoven in all the manuscripts examined for this work, an\r\nofficial document or two excepted, is upon an unfinished copy of one of\r\nBach’s cantatas in these words: “Written by my dear father;”[22] and\r\none of the works most used by him in compiling his “Materialien für\r\nContrapunkt” in 1809 was Bach’s “Versuch über die wahre Art das Clavier\r\nzu Spielen.” The unlucky remark of Wegeler, founded, too, possibly upon\r\nsome expression of Beethoven’s in a moment of spleen, but certainly\r\nnot in justice, has cast a shadow upon the relation between Neefe and\r\nhis pupil. Writer after writer has copied without examining it. Does\r\nit bear examination? Possibly, if it be supposed to relate only to\r\nexecution upon the pianoforte and organ; but in no other case. It is\r\nself-evident that serious study in the severe school of the Bachs was\r\nnecessary to counteract the influence of the light and trivial music of\r\nthe Bonn stage upon the young genius; and to Neefe the credit of seeing\r\nthis and acting accordingly must be given. The reader’s attention\r\nis called particularly to the words “He is now training him in\r\ncomposition, and for his encouragement has had nine variations for the\r\npianoforte written by him on a march by Dressler engraved at Mannheim,”\r\nin Neefe’s notice of Beethoven above cited, and the date of the article\r\nfrom which it is taken--March 2, 1783. Is it not perfectly clear\r\nthat these variations have been recently composed, and very recently\r\nprinted? Yet upon the title stands, “Par un jeune amateur, Louis van\r\nBeethoven, âgé de dix ans.” If this were a solitary case of apparent\r\ndiscrepancy between the boy’s age and the year given it would attract\r\nand deserve no notice; but it is one of many and adds its weight to the\r\nevidence of that falsification already spoken of.[23]\r\n\r\nA second work belonging to this period is a two-part fugue in D for the\r\norgan.[24]\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN AS NEEFE’S ASSISTANT\r\n\r\nTo return to the young organist, who, since the publication of\r\nWegeler’s “Notizen,” has always been supposed to have been placed at\r\nthat instrument by the Elector Max Franz in the year 1785, as a method\r\nof giving him pecuniary aid without touching his feelings of pride and\r\nindependence. The place of assistant to Neefe was no sinecure; although\r\nnot involving much labor, it brought with it much confinement. The\r\nold organ had been destroyed by the fire of 1777, and a small chamber\r\ninstrument still supplied its place. It was the constantly recurring\r\nnecessity of being present at the religious services which made the\r\nposition onerous.\r\n\r\n     On all Sundays and regular festivals (says the Court Calendar)\r\n     high mass at 11 a.m. and vespers at 3 (sometimes 4) p.m. The\r\n     vespers will be sung throughout in _Capellis solemnibus_ by the\r\n     musicians of the electoral court, the middle vespers will be\r\n     sung by the court clergy and musicians chorally as far as the\r\n     _Magnificat_, which will be performed musically. On all Wednesdays\r\n     in Lent the _Miserere_ will be sung by the chapel at 5 p.m. and\r\n     on all Fridays the _Stabat mater_. Every Saturday at 3 p.m. the\r\n     Litanies at the altar of Our Lady of Loretto. Every day throughout\r\n     the year two masses will be read, the one at 9, the other at\r\n     11--on Sundays the latter at 10.\r\n\r\nSuch a programme gave the organist something at least to do, and when\r\nNeefe left Bonn for Münster, June 20, 1782, he left his pupil no easy\r\ntask. Before the close of the theatrical season of the next winter\r\n(1782-’83) the master was obliged to call upon the boy for still\r\nfarther assistance. “In the winter of 1784,” writes the widow Neefe,\r\n“my husband of blessed memory was temporarily entrusted with the\r\ndirection of the church music as well as other music at court while the\r\nElectoral Chapelmaster L. was absent on a journey of several months.”\r\nThe date is wrong, for Lucchesi’s petition for leave of absence was\r\ngranted April 26, 1783. Thus overwhelmed with business, Neefe could\r\nno longer conduct at the pianoforte the rehearsals for the stage,\r\nand Ludwig van Beethoven, now 12 years old, became also “cembalist\r\nin the orchestra.” In those days every orchestra was provided with a\r\nharpsichord or pianoforte, seated at which the director guided the\r\nperformance, playing from the score. Here, then, was in part the\r\norigin of that marvellous power, with which in later years Beethoven\r\nastonished his contemporaries, of reading and playing the most\r\ndifficult and involved scores at first sight. The position of cembalist\r\nwas one of equal honor and responsibility. Handel and Matthison’s duel\r\ngrew out of the fact that the former would not leave the harpsichord on\r\na certain occasion before the close of the performance. Gassmann placed\r\nthe young Salieri at the harpsichord of the Imperial Opera House as\r\nthe best possible means of training him to become the great conductor\r\nthat he was. This was the high place of honor given to Haydn when in\r\nLondon. In Ludwig van Beethoven’s case it was the place in which he,\r\nas Mosel says of Salieri, “could make practical use of what he learned\r\nfrom books and scores at home.” Moreover, it was a place in which he\r\ncould, even in boyhood, hear to satiety the popular Italian, French\r\nand German operas of the day and learn to feel that something higher\r\nand nobler was necessary to touch the deeper feelings of the heart; a\r\nplace which, had the Elector lived ten years longer, might have given\r\nthe world another not merely great but prolific, nay inexhaustible,\r\noperatic composer. The cembalist’s duties doubtless came to an end with\r\nthe departure of the Elector for Münster in May or June, and he then\r\nhad time for other pursuits, of which composition was one. A song,\r\n“Schilderung eines Mädchens,” by him was printed this year in Bossler’s\r\n“Blumenlese für Liebhaber,” and a Rondo in C for pianoforte, anonymous,\r\nwhich immediately follows, was also of his composition. A more\r\nimportant work, which before the close of the year was published by\r\nBossler with a magniloquent dedication to Max Friedrich, was the three\r\nsonatas for pianoforte, according to the title, if true, “composed by\r\nLudwig van Beethoven, aged 11 years.”[25] The reader can judge whether\r\nor not the 11 should be 12.\r\n\r\nTo turn for a moment to the Beethoven family matters. This summer\r\n(1783) had brought them some sorrow again. The child Franz Georg, now\r\njust two and a half years old, died August 16th. This was another\r\nstroke of bad fortune which not only wounded the heart but added to\r\nthe pecuniary difficulties of the father, who was now losing his\r\nvoice and whose character is described in an official report made the\r\nnext summer by the words “of tolerable conduct.” If the duties of\r\nNeefe during the last season had been laborious, in the coming one,\r\n1783-’84, they were still more arduous. It was the first under the new\r\ncontract by which the Elector assumed all the costs of the theatre,\r\nand a woman, Mme. Grossmann, had the direction. It was all-important\r\nto singers, actors and whoever was concerned that the result of the\r\nexperiment should be satisfactory to their employer; and as the opera\r\nwas more to his taste than the spoken drama, so much the more difficult\r\nwas Neefe’s task. Besides his acting as chapelmaster in the place of\r\nLucchesi, still absent, there was “every forenoon rehearsal of opera,”\r\nas Mme. Grossmann wrote to Councillor T., at which, of course, Neefe\r\nhad to be present. There was ever new music to be examined, arranged,\r\ncopied, composed--what not?--all which he must attend to; in short, he\r\nhad everything to do which could be imposed upon a theatrical music\r\ndirector with a salary of 1,000 florins. It therefore became a busy\r\ntime for his young assistant, who still had no recognition as member\r\nof the court chapel, not even as “accessist”--the last “accessist”\r\norganist was Meuris (1778)--and consequently no salary from the court.\r\nBut he had now more than completed the usual year of probation to\r\nwhich candidates were subjected, and his talents and skill were well\r\nenough known to warrant his petition for an appointment. The petition\r\nhas not been discovered; but the report made upon it to the privy\r\ncouncil has been preserved, together with the following endorsement:\r\n“High Lord Steward Count von Salm, referring to the petition of Ludwig\r\nvan Beethoven for the position of Assistant Court Organist, is of the\r\nhumble opinion that the grace ought to be bestowed upon him, together\r\nwith a small compensation.” This endorsement is dated “Bonn, February\r\n29, 1784.” The report upon the petition is as follows:\r\n\r\nAPPOINTED ASSISTANT COURT ORGANIST\r\n\r\n    Most Reverend Archbishop and Elector,\r\n    Most Gracious Lord, Lord.\r\n\r\n     Your Electoral Grace has graciously been pleased to demand a\r\n     dutiful report from me on the petition of Ludwig van Beethoven to\r\n     Your Grace under date the 15th inst.\r\n\r\n     Obediently and without delay (I report) that suppliant’s father\r\n     was for 29 years, his grandfather for 46, in the service of\r\n     Your Most Reverend Electoral Grace and Your Electoral Grace’s\r\n     predecessors; that the suppliant has been amply proved and found\r\n     capable to play the court organ as he has done in the absence\r\n     of Organist Neefe, also at rehearsals of the plays and elsewhere\r\n     and will continue to do so in the future; that Your Grace has\r\n     graciously provided for his care and subsistence (his father no\r\n     longer being able to do so). It is therefore my humble judgment\r\n     that for these reasons the suppliant well deserves to have\r\n     graciously bestowed upon him the position of assistant at the\r\n     court organ and an increase of remuneration. Commending myself to\r\n     the good will of Your Most Reverend Electoral Grace I am Your Most\r\n     Reverend Grace’s\r\n\r\n    most humble and obedient servant\r\n\r\n    Sigismund Altergraff zu\r\n    Salm und Reifferscheid.\r\n\r\n    Bonn, February 23, 1784.\r\n\r\nThe action taken is thus indicated:\r\n\r\n    _Ad Sup._\r\n\r\n    Ludwig van Beethoven.\r\n\r\n    On the obedient report the suppliant’s submissive prayer,\r\n    granted. (_Beruhet._)\r\n\r\n    Bonn, February 29, 1784.\r\n\r\nAgain, on the cover:\r\n\r\n    _Ad sup._\r\n\r\n    Lud. van Beethoven,\r\n    Granted. (_Beruhet._)\r\n\r\n    Sig. Bonn, February 29, 1784.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of the case, the warm recommendation of\r\nSalm-Reifferscheid, very probably, too, the Elector’s own knowledge\r\nof the fitness of the candidate, and perhaps the flattery in the\r\ndedication of the sonatas--for these were the days when dedications\r\nbut half disguised petitions for favor--were sufficient inducements\r\nto His Transparency at length to confirm the young organist in the\r\nposition which Neefe’s kindness had now for nearly two years given\r\nhim. Opinions differ as to the precise meaning of the word _Beruhet_\r\n(translated “granted” in the above transcripts); but this much is\r\ncertain: Beethoven was not appointed assistant organist in 1785 by Max\r\nFranz at the instance of Count Waldstein, but at the age of 13 in the\r\nspring of 1784 by Max Friedrich, and upon his own petition supported by\r\nthe influence of Neefe and of Salm-Reifferscheid.\r\n\r\nThe appointment was made, but the salary had not been determined on\r\nwhen an event occurred which wrought an entire change in the position\r\nof theatrical affairs at Bonn:--the Elector died on April 15, and the\r\ntheatrical company was dismissed with four weeks’ wages. There was no\r\nlonger a necessity for a second organist; and fortunate it was for\r\nthe assistant that his name came before Max Friedrich’s successor (in\r\nthe reports soon to be copied) as being a regular member of the court\r\nchapel, although “without salary.” Lucchesi returned to Bonn; Neefe\r\nhad nothing to do but play his organ, cultivate his garden outside the\r\ntown and give music lessons. It was long before such a conjunction of\r\ncircumstances occurred as would have led the economical Max Franz to\r\nappoint an organist adjunct. Happy was it, therefore, that one of the\r\ndeceased Elector’s last acts secured young Beethoven the place.\r\n\r\nEARLY EFFORTS AT COMPOSITION\r\n\r\nThe excellent Frau Karth, born in 1780, could not recall to memory any\r\nperiod of her childhood down to the death of Johann van Beethoven,\r\nwhen he and his family did not live in the lodging above that of her\r\nparents. This fact, together with the circumstance that no mention is\r\nmade of the Beethovens in the account of the great inundation of the\r\nRhine in February, 1782, when all the families dwelling in the Fischer\r\nhouse of the Rheingasse were rescued in boats from the windows of the\r\nfirst story, added to the strong probability that Beethoven’s position\r\nwas but the first formal step of the regular process of confirming an\r\nappointment already determined upon;--these points strongly suggest\r\nthe idea that to Ludwig’s advancement his father owed the ability to\r\ndwell once more in a better part of the town, i.e., in the pleasant\r\nhouse No. 462 Wenzelgasse. The house is very near the Minorite church,\r\nwhich contained a good organ, concerning the pedal measurements of\r\nwhich, as we have seen, Beethoven made a memorandum in a note-book\r\nwhich he carried with him to Vienna.[26] In the “Neuen Blumenlese für\r\nKlavierliebhaber” of this year, Part I, pp. 18 and 19, appeared a Rondo\r\nfor Pianoforte, in A major, “dal Sig^{re} van Beethoven”[27]; and Part\r\nII, p. 44, the Arioso “An einen Säugling, von Hrn. Beethoven.”[28] “Un\r\nConcert pour le Clavecin ou Fortepiano composé par Louis van Beethoven\r\nâgé de douze ans,” 32 pp. manuscript written in a boy’s hand, may also\r\nbelong to this year[29]; and, judging by the handwriting, to the\r\nperiod may also be assigned a movement in three parts of four pages,\r\nformerly in the Artaria collection, without title, date or remark of\r\nany kind.[30]\r\n\r\nThe widow Karth perfectly remembered Johann van Beethoven as a tall,\r\nhandsome man with powdered head. Ries and Simrock described Ludwig to\r\nDr. Müller “as a boy powerfully, almost clumsily built.”[31] How easily\r\nfancy pictures them--the tall man walking to chapel or rehearsal with\r\nthe little boy trotting by his side, through the streets of Bonn, and\r\nthe gratified expression of the father as the child takes the place and\r\nperforms the duties of a man!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] “Morgengesang am Schöpfungstage.”\r\n\r\n[23] As given by Nottebohm in his catalogue (p. 154) the title of\r\nthe original publication of the Variations by Goetz of Mannheim ran\r\nas follows: “_Variations pour le Clavecin sur une Marche de Mr.\r\nDressler, composées et Dediées à son Excellence Madame la Comtesse de\r\nWolfmetternich, née Baronne d’Assebourg, par un jeune amateur Louis\r\nvan Beethoven, âgé de dix ans. 1780._” Inasmuch as Nottebohm’s Notes\r\non Thayer’s “Chronologisches Verzeichniss” do not give the date 1780,\r\nit was probably appended by mistake. In the _delle Sinfonie, etc., che\r\nsi trovanno in manoscritto nella officina de Breitkopf in Lipsia_,\r\nunder the compositions of 1782, 1783 and 1784: _Variations da Louis\r\nvan Beethoven, âgé de dix ans, Mannheim_, with the theme in notation.\r\nThe Countess Wolff-Metternich, to whom the variations are dedicated,\r\nwas the wife of Count Ignaz von Wolff-Metternich, “Konferenzmeister”\r\nand president of the High Court of Appeals, who died in Bonn, March\r\n15, 1790. Ernst Christoph Dressler, composer of the theme varied by\r\nBeethoven, was an opera singer in Cassel.\r\n\r\n[24] The Bagatelles for Pianoforte, Op. 33. included by Thayer in his\r\nMSS. and his “Chronologisches Verzeichniss” as also belonging to this\r\nperiod on the strength of their superscription on a manuscript copy,\r\n“Louis van Beethoven ... 1782,” were, as Nottebohm has shown, not\r\ncomposed at this time. One of them was composed in 1802 and another\r\nsketched between 1799 and 1801. See Nottebohm (“Zweite Beethoveniana,”\r\np. 250). Nottebohm conjectures that the organ fugue was composed at his\r\ntrial for the post of second court organist. In view of the fact that\r\nhis age was falsified by his father at this time, it is likely that the\r\nwork was composed in 1783.\r\n\r\n[25] Title of the original publication: “Drei Sonaten für Klavier, dem\r\nHochwürdigsten Erzbischofe und Kurfürsten zu Köln, Maximilian Friedrich\r\nmeinem gnädigsten Herrn gewidmet und verfertigt von Ludwig van\r\nBeethoven, alt eilf Jahr.” Beethoven wrote on a copy of the sonatas:\r\n“These Sonatas and the Variations of Dressler are my first works.” He\r\nprobably meant his first published works. See Thayer’s “Chronologisches\r\nVerzeichniss,” p. 2, 183.\r\n\r\n[26] The editor has here thought it advisable to permit Thayer’s\r\noriginal text to stand in the body of the book, although Dr. Deiters\r\nmade a radical correction in his revision of the first volume of the\r\nbiography. On the basis of the Fischer manuscript Dr. Deiters relates\r\nthat the Beethoven family lived in the house in the Rheingasse at the\r\ntime of the inundation; that Beethoven’s mother sought to stay the\r\nalarm of the inmates with encouraging words, but at the last had to\r\nmake her escape with the others into the Giergasse over boards and down\r\nladders. Admitting that there are many inaccuracies in the recital, Dr.\r\nDeiters nevertheless accepts it in this particular and conjectures that\r\nBeethoven lived in the house in the Rheingasse until 1785.\r\n\r\n[27] B. and H. Ges. Ausg. Serie 18, No. 196.\r\n\r\n[28] B. and H. Ges. Ausg. Serie 23, No. 229.\r\n\r\n[29] The manuscript contains the solo part complete with the orchestral\r\npreludes and interludes in transcription for pianoforte. There are\r\nindications that it was scored for small orchestra--strings, flutes and\r\nhorns only. The composition was long unknown. Thayer included it in his\r\n“Chronologisches Verzeichniss” under No. 7, giving the themes. Guido\r\nAdler edited it at a much later date, and it has been published in the\r\nsupplement to the collected works of Beethoven.\r\n\r\n[30] Nottebohm conjectured that the movement referred to by Thayer was\r\nthat for a musical clock, No. 29, in Thayer’s chronological catalogue,\r\nthere described as a duo. Dr. Deiters thinks that it was a fragment of\r\na composition for pianoforte and violin, No. 131 in the catalogue of\r\nthe Artaria collection. It contains suggestions of Beethoven’s style,\r\nbut the manuscript is a copy, not an autograph, and its authenticity is\r\nnot proven.\r\n\r\n[31] In the Fischer MS.: “Short of stature, broad shoulders, short\r\nneck, large head, round nose, dark brown complexion; he always bent\r\nforward slightly when he walked. In the house he was called der Spagnol\r\n(the Spaniard).”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\n\r\n     Maria Theresia--Appearance and Character of Elector Max\r\n     Franz--Musical Culture in the Austrian Imperial Family--A Royal\r\n     Violinist--His Admiration for Mozart--His Court Music.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Maria Theresia was a tender mother, much concerned to see all her\r\n     children well provided for in her lifetime and as independent as\r\n     possible of her eldest son, the heir to the throne. This wish\r\n     had already been fulfilled in the case of several of them....\r\n     The youngest son, Maximilian (born in Vienna, December 8, 1756),\r\n     was already chosen coadjutor to his paternal uncle, Duke Karl of\r\n     Lorraine, Grand Master of the Teutonic Order. But to provide a\r\n     more bountiful and significant support, Prince Kaunitz formulated\r\n     a plan which pleased the maternal heart of the monarch, and whose\r\n     execution was calculated to extend the influence of the Court of\r\n     Vienna in the German Empire. It was to bestow more ecclesiastical\r\n     principalities upon the Archduke Maximilian. His eyes fell\r\n     first upon the Archbishopric and Electorate of Cologne and the\r\n     Archbishopric and Principality of Münster. These two countries\r\n     had one and the same Regent, Maximilian Friedrich, descended\r\n     from the Suabian family of Königseck-Rothenfels, Counts of the\r\n     Empire. In view of the advanced age of this ruler his death did\r\n     not seem far distant; but it was thought best not to wait for\r\n     that contingency, but to secure the right of succession at once\r\n     by having the Archduke elected Coadjutor in Cologne and Münster.\r\n     Their possession was looked upon as a provision worthy of the son\r\n     of an Empress-Queen. As Elector and Lord of the Rhenish shore,\r\n     simultaneously co-director of the Westphalian Circuit (a dignity\r\n     associated with the archbishopric of Münster), he could be useful\r\n     to his house, and oppose the Prussian influence in the very part\r\n     of Germany where it was largest.\r\n\r\nThus Dohm begins the seventh chapter of his “Denkwürdigkeiten”\r\nwhere, in a calm and passionless style, he relates the history of\r\nthe intrigues and negotiations which ended in the election of Maria\r\nTheresia’s youngest son on August 7, 1780, as coadjutor to the Elector\r\nof Cologne and, on the 16th of the same month, to that of Münster, and\r\nsecured him the peaceful and immediate succession when Max Friedrich’s\r\nfunctions should cease. The news of the election at Cologne reached\r\nBonn on the same day about 1 o’clock p. m. The Elector proceeded at\r\nonce to the Church of the Franciscans (used as the chapel since\r\nthe conflagration of 1777), where a “musical ‘Te Deum’” was sung,\r\nwhile all the city bells were ringing. Von Kleist’s regiment fired a\r\ntriple salvo, which the cannon on the city walls answered. At noon a\r\npublic dinner was spread in the palace, one table setting 54, another\r\n24 covers. In the evening at 8-1/2 o’clock, followed the finest\r\nillumination ever seen in Bonn, which the Elector enjoyed riding about\r\nin his carriage. After this came a grand supper of 82 covers, then\r\na masked ball “to which every decently clad subject as well as any\r\nstranger was admitted, and which did not come to an end till nearly 7\r\no’clock.”\r\n\r\nMAX FRANZ, THE NEW ELECTOR\r\n\r\nMax Franz was in his twenty-eighth year when he came to Bonn. He was of\r\nmiddle stature, strongly built and already inclining to that corpulence\r\nwhich in his last years made him a prodigy of obesity. If all the\r\nabsurdities of his eulogists be taken for truth, the last Elector of\r\nCologne was endowed with every grace of mind and character that ever\r\nadorned human nature. In fact, however, he was a good-looking, kindly,\r\nindolent, somewhat choleric man; fond of a joke; affable; a hater of\r\nstiff ceremony; easy of access; an honest, amiable, conscientious\r\nruler, who had the wisdom and will to supply his own deficiencies with\r\nenlightened and skilful ministers, and the good sense to rule, through\r\ntheir political foresight and sagacity, with an eye as much to the\r\ninterests of his subjects as his own.\r\n\r\nIn his boyhood he was rather stupid. Swinburne dismisses him in two\r\nlines: “Maximilian is a good-natured, neither here-nor-there kind of\r\nyouth.” The brilliant, witty, shrewdly observant Mozart wrote to his\r\nfather (Nov. 17, 1781): “To whom God gives an office he also gives an\r\nunderstanding. This is really the case with the Archduke. Before he\r\nbecame a priest he was much wittier and more intellectual and talked\r\nless, but more sensibly. You ought to see him now! Stupidity looks out\r\nof his eyes; he talks eternally, always in falsetto; he has a swollen\r\nneck--in a word, the man is completely transformed.” His mother had\r\nsupplied him with the best instructors that Vienna afforded, and\r\nhad sent him travelling pretty extensively for an archduke in those\r\ndays. One of his journeys was to visit his sister Marie Antoinette\r\nin Paris, where his awkwardness and breaches of etiquette caused as\r\nmuch amusement to the anti-Austrian party as they did annoyance to the\r\nQueen, and afterwards to his brother Joseph, when they came to his ears.\r\n\r\nIn 1778 he was with Joseph in the campaign in Bavaria. An injury to his\r\nknee, caused by a fall of his horse, is the reason alleged for his\r\nabandonment of a military career; upon which he was prevailed upon,\r\nso the “Historisches Taschenbuch” (II, Vienna, 1806) expresses it, to\r\nbecome a candidate for the Coadjutorship of Cologne. If he had to be\r\n“prevailed upon” to enter the church, the more to his credit was the\r\ncourse he pursued when once his calling and election were sure.\r\n\r\nThe rigid economy which he introduced at court immediately after his\r\naccession in 1784 gave rise to the impression that he was penurious.\r\nIt may be said in his defence that the condition of the finances\r\nrequired retrenchment and reform; that he was simple in his tastes and\r\ncared nothing for show and magnificence, except upon occasions when,\r\nin his opinion, the electoral dignity required them. Then, like his\r\npredecessors, he was lavish. His personal expenses were not great, and\r\nhe waited until his revenues justified it before he indulged to any\r\ngreat extent his passion for the theatre, music and dancing (stout as\r\nhe was, he was a passionate dancer), and his table. He was, through\r\nthe nature of his physical constitution, an enormous eater, though his\r\ndrink was only water.\r\n\r\nThe influence of a ruler upon the tone and character of society in a\r\nsmall capital is very great. A change for the better had begun during\r\nthe time of Max Friedrich, but under his successor a new life entered\r\nBonn. New objects of ambition were offered to the young men. The church\r\nand cloister ceased to be all in all. One can well understand how\r\nWegeler in his old age, as he looked back half a century to the years\r\nwhen he was student and professor--and _such_ a half-century, with its\r\nrevolutionary and Napoleonic wars, its political, religious and social\r\nchanges!--should write (“Notizen,” p. 59): “In fact, it was a beautiful\r\nand in many ways active period in Bonn, so long as the genial Elector,\r\nMax Franz, Maria Theresia’s youngest son and favorite, reigned there.”\r\nHow strongly the improved tone of society impressed itself upon the\r\ncharacters of the young is discernible in the many of them who, in\r\nafter years, were known as men of large and liberal ideas and became\r\ndistinguished as jurists, theologians and artists, or in science and\r\nletters. These were the years of Beethoven’s youth and early manhood;\r\nand though his great mental powers were in the main exercised upon\r\nhis art, there is still to be observed through all his life a certain\r\nbreadth and grandeur in his intellectual character, owing in part, no\r\ndoubt, to the social influences under which it was developed.\r\n\r\nIt is highly honorable to the young Max Franz that he refused to avail\r\nhimself of a privilege granted him in a Papal bull obtained for him\r\nby his mother--that of deferring the assumption of priestly vows for\r\na period of ten years--but chose rather, as soon as he had leisure\r\nfor the step, to enter the seminary in Cologne to fit himself for\r\nconsecration. He entered November 29, rigidly submitted himself to all\r\nthe discipline of the institution for the period of eight days, when,\r\non December 8, the nuntius, Bellisoni, ordained him sub-deacon; after\r\nanother eight days, on the 16th, deacon; and on the 21st, priest;\r\nthus showing that if there be no royal road to mathematics, there\r\nis a railway with express train for royal personages in pursuit of\r\necclesiastical science. Returning to Bonn, he read his first mass on\r\nChristmas eve in the Florian Chapel.\r\n\r\nThe cause of science and education the Elector had really at\r\nheart. In 1785 he had established a botanic garden; now he opened\r\na public reading room in the palace library and sent a message to\r\nthe theological school in Cologne, that if the improved course of\r\ninstruction adopted in Austria was not introduced, he should found\r\nother seminaries. On the 26th of June he was present at the opening of\r\na normal school; and on August 9th came the decree raising the Bonn\r\nHochschule to the rank of a university by authority of an Imperial\r\ndiploma.\r\n\r\nUpon the suppression of the Jesuits in 1774, Max Friedrich devoted\r\ntheir possessions and revenues to the cause of education. New\r\nprofessorships were established in the gymnasium and in 1777 an\r\n“Academy” was formed. This was the first step; the second was to found\r\nan independent institution called the Lyceum; and at his death an\r\napplication was before the Emperor for a university charter. Max Franz\r\npushed the matter, obtained the charter from his brother, and Monday,\r\nthe 20th of November, 1786, was the day appointed for the solemn\r\ninauguration of the new institution. The Court Calendar for the next\r\nyear names six professors of theology, six of jurisprudence, civil\r\nand ecclesiastical, four of medicine, and ten of philology and other\r\nbranches of learning. In later editions new names are added; in that of\r\n1790, Wegeler is professor of midwifery.\r\n\r\nThough economical, Max Franz drew many a man of superior abilities--men\r\nof letters and artists--to Bonn; and but for the bursting of the storm\r\nwhich was even then gathering over the French border, his little\r\ncapital might well have had a place in German literary history not\r\ninferior to that of Weimar. Nor are instances wanting in which he gave\r\ngenerous aid to young talent struggling with poverty; though that he\r\ndid so much for Beethoven as is usually thought is, at least, doubtful.\r\n\r\nThis man, not a genius, not overwhelmingly great mentally, nor, on\r\nthe other hand, so stupid as the stories told of his boyhood seem to\r\nindicate, but honest, well-meaning, ready to adopt and enforce wise\r\nmeasures devised by skilful ministers; easy, jocose and careless\r\nof appearances, very fond of music and a patron of letters and\r\nscience,--this man, to whom in that period of vast intellectual\r\nfermentation the Index Expurgatorius was a dead letter, gave the tone\r\nto Bonn society.\r\n\r\nA GIFTED IMPERIAL FAMILY\r\n\r\nThat solid musical education which she had received from her father,\r\nMaria Theresia bestowed upon her children, and their attainments in the\r\nart seem to have justified the time and labor spent. In 1749, at the\r\nage of seven and six, Christina and Maria Elizabeth took part in one\r\nof the festive musical pieces; Marie Antoinette was able to appreciate\r\nGluck and lead the party in his favor in later years at Paris. Joseph\r\nis as much known in musical as in civil and political history. When\r\nEmperor he had his daily hour of music in his private apartments,\r\nplaying either of several instruments or singing, according to the whim\r\nof the moment; and Maximilian, the youngest, acquired a good degree of\r\nskill both in singing and in the treatment of his favorite instrument,\r\nthe viola. Beethoven once told Schindler that the Elector thought very\r\nhighly of Mattheson. In his reminiscences of a visit to Vienna in\r\n1783, J. F. Reichardt gives high praise to the musical interest, skill\r\nand zeal of Emperor Joseph and his brother Archduke Maximilian, and a\r\nwriter in “Cramer’s Magazine,” probably Neefe, tells of a “remarkable\r\nconcert” which took place at court in Bonn on April 5, 1786, at which\r\nthe Elector played the viola, Duke Albrecht the violin, “and the\r\nfascinating Countess Belderbusch the clavier most charmingly.”\r\n\r\nMaximilian had become personally acquainted with Mozart in Salzburg in\r\n1775, where the young composer had set Metastasio’s “Il Re pastore”\r\nto music to be performed in his honor (April 23rd); from which time,\r\nto his credit be it said, he ever held the composer and his music in\r\nkindest remembrance. When in 1781 Mozart determined to leave his brutal\r\nArchbishop of Salzburg and remain in Vienna, the Archduke showed at all\r\nevents a desire to aid him.\r\n\r\n     Yesterday (writes the composer November 17, 1781) the Archduke\r\n     Maximilian summoned me to him at 3 o’clock in the afternoon.\r\n     When I entered he was standing before a stove in the first room\r\n     awaiting me. He came towards me and asked if I had anything to\r\n     do to-day? “Nothing, Your Royal Highness, and if I had it would\r\n     always be a grace to wait upon Your Royal Highness.” “No; I do not\r\n     wish to constrain anyone.” Then he said that he was minded to\r\n     give a concert in the evening for the Court of Wurtemberg. Would I\r\n     play something and accompany the aria? I was to come to him again\r\n     at 6 o’clock. So I played there yesterday.\r\n\r\n     Mozart was everything to him (continues Jahn); he signalized him\r\n     at every opportunity and said, if he were Elector of Cologne,\r\n     Mozart would surely be his chapelmaster. He had also suggested to\r\n     the Princess (of Wurtemberg) that she appoint Mozart her music\r\n     teacher, but received the reply that if it rested with her she\r\n     would have chosen him; but the Emperor--“for him there is nobody\r\n     but Salieri!” cries out Mozart peevishly--had recommended Salieri\r\n     because of the singing, and she had to take him, for which she was\r\n     sorry.\r\n\r\nJahn gives no reason why Mozart was not engaged for Bonn. Perhaps he\r\nwould have been had Lucchesi resigned in consequence of the reduction\r\nof his salary; but he kept his office of chapelmaster and could not\r\nwell be dismissed without cause. Mattioli’s resignation was followed by\r\nthe call of Joseph Reicha to the place of concertmaster; but for Mozart\r\nno vacancy occurred at that time. Maximilian was in Vienna during most\r\nof the month of October, 1785, and may have desired to secure Mozart in\r\nsome way, but just at that time the latter was, as his father wrote,\r\n“over head and ears busy with the opera ‘Le Nozze di Figaro.’” Old\r\nChapelmaster Bono could not live much longer; which gave him hope,\r\nshould the opera succeed, of obtaining a permanent appointment in\r\nVienna; and, in short, his prospects seemed just then so good that\r\nhis determination--if he should really receive an offer from the\r\nElector--to remain in the great capital rather than to take his young\r\nwife so far away from home and friends as the Rhine then was, and, in a\r\nmanner, bury himself in a small town where so few opportunities would\r\nprobably be given him for the exercise of the vast powers which he was\r\nconscious of possessing, need not surprise us.\r\n\r\nWas it the good or the ill fortune of the boy Beethoven that Mozart\r\ncame not to Bonn? His marvellous original talents were thus left to\r\nbe developed without the fostering care of one of the very greatest\r\nof musical geniuses, and one of the profoundest of musical scholars;\r\nbut on the other hand it was not oppressed, perhaps crushed, by daily\r\nintercourse with that genius and scholarship.\r\n\r\nMaximilian, immediately after reaching Bonn as Elector, ordered full\r\nand minute reports to be made out concerning all branches of the\r\nadministration, of the public and court service and of the cost of\r\ntheir maintenance. Upon these reports were based his arrangements for\r\nthe future. Those relating to the court music are too important and\r\ninteresting to be overlooked, for they give us details which carry\r\nus instantly into the circle which young Beethoven has just entered\r\nand in which, through his father’s connection with it, he must from\r\nearliest childhood have moved. They are three in number, the first\r\nbeing a list of all the individuals constituting the court chapel; the\r\nsecond a detailed description of the singers and players, together with\r\nestimates of their capabilities; the third consists of recommendations\r\ntouching a reduction in salaries. A few paragraphs may be presented\r\nhere as most intimately connected with significant personages in our\r\nhistory; they are combined and given in abstract from the first two\r\ndocuments. Among the tenors we find\r\n\r\nFATHER AND SON IN THE COURT CHAPEL\r\n\r\n     J. van Beethoven, age 44, born in Bonn, married; his wife is 32\r\n     years old, has three sons living in the electorate, aged 13, 10\r\n     and 8 years, who are studying music, has served 28 years, salary\r\n     315 fl. “His voice has long been stale, has been long in the\r\n     service, very poor, of fair deportment and married.”\r\n\r\nAmong the organists:\r\n\r\n     Christian Gottlob Neefe, aged 36, born at Chemnitz; married, his\r\n     wife is 32, has served 3 years, was formerly chapelmaster with\r\n     Seiler; salary 400 fl. “Christian Neffe, the organist, in my\r\n     humble opinion might well be dismissed, inasmuch as he is not\r\n     particularly versed on the organ, moreover is a foreigner, having\r\n     no _Meritten_ whatever and of the Calvinistic religion.”\r\n\r\n     Ludwig van Beethoven, aged 13, born at Bonn, has served 2 years,\r\n     no salary. “Ludwig Betthoven, a son of the Betthoven sub No. 8,\r\n     has no salary, but during the absence of the chapelmaster Luchesy\r\n     he played the organ; is of good capability, still young, of good\r\n     and quiet deportment and poor.”\r\n\r\nOne of the items of the third report, proposing reductions of salaries\r\nand removals, has a very special interest as proving that an effort was\r\nmade to supplant Neefe and give the post of court organist to young\r\nBeethoven. It reads:\r\n\r\n     _Item._ If Neffe were to be dismissed another organist would have\r\n     to be appointed, who, if he were to be used only in the chapel\r\n     could be had for 150 florins, the same is small, young, and a son\r\n     of a court _musici_, and in case of need has filled the place for\r\n     nearly a year very well.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to have Neefe dismissed from the service failed, but a\r\nreduction of his salary to the pittance of 200 florins had already\r\nled him to look about him to find an engagement for himself and wife\r\nin some theatre, when Maximilian, having become acquainted with his\r\nmerits (notwithstanding his Calvinism), restored his former allowance\r\nby a decree dated February 8, 1785. When Joseph Reicha came to Bonn in\r\nMattioli’s place is still undetermined with exactness; but a decree\r\nraising him from the position of concertmaster to that of concert\r\ndirector, and increasing his salary to 1,000 florins, bears date June\r\n28, 1785. In the general payroll of this year Reicha’s salary is stated\r\nto be 666 thalers 52 alb., “tenorist Beethoven’s” 200 th., “Beethoven\r\njun.” 100 th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\n\r\n     Beethoven Again--The Young Organist--A First Visit\r\n     to Vienna--Death of Beethoven’s Mother--Sympathetic\r\n     Acquaintances--Dr. Wegeler’s “Notizen”--Some Questions of\r\n     Chronology.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchindler records--and on such points his testimony is good--that he\r\nhad heard Beethoven attribute the marvellous development of Mozart’s\r\ngenius in great measure to the “consistent instruction of his father,”\r\nthus implying his sense of the disadvantages under which he himself\r\nlabored from the want of regular and systematic musical training\r\nthrough the period of his childhood and youth.[32] It is, however, by\r\nno means certain that had Ludwig van Beethoven been the son of Leopold\r\nMozart, he would ever have acquired that facility of expression which\r\nenabled Wolfgang Mozart to fill up the richest and most varied scores\r\nalmost as rapidly as his pen could move, and so as hardly to need\r\ncorrection--as if the development of musical idea was to him a work of\r\nmere routine, or perhaps, better to say, of instinct. _Poeta nascitur,\r\nnon fit_, not only in respect to his thoughts but to his power of\r\nclothing them in language. Many a man of profoundest ideas can never\r\nby any amount of study and practice acquire the art of conveying them\r\nin a lucid and elegant manner. On the other hand there are those whose\r\nthoughts never rise above the ordinary level, but whose essays are\r\nvery models of style. Handel said of the elder Telemann, that he could\r\ncompose in eight parts as easily as he (Handel) could write a letter;\r\nand Handel’s own facility in composition was something astonishing.\r\nBeethoven, on the contrary, as his original scores prove, earned his\r\nbread by the sweat of his brow. But no amount of native genius can\r\ncompensate for the want of thorough training. If, therefore, it be true\r\nthat nature had in some degree limited his powers of expressing his\r\nmusical as well as his intellectual ideas, so much greater was the need\r\nthat, at the age which he had now reached, he should have opportunity\r\nto prosecute uninterruptedly a more profound and systematic course of\r\nstudy. Hence, the death of Maximilian Friedrich, which must have seemed\r\nto the Beethovens at first a sad calamity, proved in the end a blessing\r\nin disguise; for while it did not deprive the boy of the pecuniary\r\nbenefits of the position to which he had just been appointed, it gave\r\nhim two or three years of comparative leisure, uninterrupted save by\r\nhis share of the organist’s duties, for his studies, which there is\r\nevery reason to suppose he continued under the guidance of his firm\r\nfriend Neefe.\r\n\r\nThese three years were a period of theatrical inactivity in Bonn.\r\nFor the carnival season of 1785, the Elector engaged Böhm and his\r\ncompany, then playing alternately at Cologne, Aix-la-Chapelle and\r\nDüsseldorf. This troupe during its short season may have furnished\r\nthe young organist with valuable matter for reflection, for in the\r\nlist of newly studied pieces, from October 1783 to the same month\r\n1785--thus including the engagement in Bonn--are Gluck’s “Alceste”\r\nand “Orpheus,” four operas of Salieri (the “Armida” among them),\r\nSarti’s “Fra due Litiganti” and “L’Incognito” in German translation,\r\nHolzbauer’s “Günther von Schwarzburg” and five of Paisiello’s operas.\r\nThese were, says the report in the “Theater-Kalender” (1786), “in\r\naddition to the old and familiar French operettas, ‘Zémire et Azor,’\r\n‘Sylvain,’ ‘Lucile,’ ‘Der Prächtige,’ ‘Der Hausfreund,’ etc., etc.”\r\nThe three serious Vienna operas, “Alceste,” “Orpheus” and “Armida,”\r\nin such broad contrast to the general character of the stock pieces\r\nof the Rhenish companies, point directly to Maximilian and the Bonn\r\nseason. The elector of Hesse-Cassel, being then in funds by the sale\r\nof his subjects to George III for the American Revolutionary War just\r\nclosed, supported a large French theatrical company, complete in the\r\nthree branches of spoken and musical drama and ballet. Max Franz, upon\r\nhis return from Vienna in November, 1785, spent a few days in Cassel,\r\nand, upon the death of the Elector and the dismissal of the actors, a\r\npart of this company was engaged to play in Bonn during January and\r\nFebruary, 1786. The performances were thrice a week, Monday, Wednesday\r\nand Saturday, and, with but two or three exceptions, consisted of a\r\ncomedy, followed by a light opera or operetta. The list contains eight\r\nof Grétry’s compositions, three by Desaides, two by Philidor, and one\r\neach by Sacchini, Champein, Pergolesi, Gossec, Frizieri, Monsigny and\r\nSchwarzendorf (called Martini)--all of light and pleasing character,\r\nand enjoying then a wide popularity not only in France but throughout\r\nthe Continent.\r\n\r\nMeantime Grossmann had left Frankfort and with Klos, previously a\r\nmanager in Hamburg, had formed a new company for the Cologne, Bonn and\r\nDüsseldorf stages. This troupe gave the Carnival performances in 1787,\r\nconfining them, so far as appears, to the old round of familiar pieces.\r\n\r\nEach of these companies had its own music director. With Böhm was\r\nMayer, composer of the “Irrlicht” and several ballets; with the French\r\ncompany Jean Baptiste Rochefort was “music-master”; and Grossmann\r\nhad recently engaged Burgmüller, of the Bellomo company, composer of\r\nincidental music for “Macbeth.” Hence, during these years, Neefe’s\r\npublic duties extended no farther than his service as organist, for\r\nLucchesi and Reicha relieved him from all the responsibilities of the\r\nchurch and concert-room.\r\n\r\nThat the organ service was at this time in part performed by the\r\nassistant organist is a matter of course; there is also an anecdote,\r\nrelated by Wegeler on the authority of Franz Ries, which proves it. On\r\nTuesday, Friday and Saturday of Holy Week, portions of the Lamentations\r\nof Jeremiah were included in the chapel service, recited by a single\r\nvoice, accompanied on the pianoforte (the organ being interdicted) to\r\nthe familiar Gregorian chant tune.\r\n\r\nTHE BOY ORGANIST CONFOUNDS A SINGER\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, in the week ending March 27, 1785, the vocalist was\r\nFerdinand Heller, too good a musician to be easily disconcerted, the\r\naccompanist Ludwig van Beethoven, now in his fifteenth year. While the\r\nsinger delivered the long passages of the Latin text to the reciting\r\nnote the accompanist might indulge his fancy, restricted only by the\r\nsolemnity fitted to the service. Wegeler relates that Beethoven\r\n\r\n     asked the singer, who sat with unusual firmness in the tonal\r\n     saddle, if he would permit him to throw him out, and utilized\r\n     the somewhat too readily granted permission to introduce so wide\r\n     an excursion in the accompaniment while persistently striking\r\n     the reciting note with his little finger, that the singer got so\r\n     bewildered that he could not find the closing cadence. Father\r\n     Ries, the first violinist, then Music Director of the Electoral\r\n     Chapel, still living, tells with details how Chapelmaster\r\n     Lucchesi, who was present, was astonished by Beethoven’s playing.\r\n     In his first access of rage Heller entered a complaint against\r\n     Beethoven with the Elector, who commanded a simpler accompaniment,\r\n     although the spirited and occasionally waggish young prince was\r\n     amused at the occurrence. Schindler adds that Beethoven in his\r\n     last years remembered the circumstance, and said that the Elector\r\n     had “reprimanded him very graciously and forbidden such clever\r\n     tricks in the future.”\r\n\r\nThe date is easily determined: In Holy Week, 1784, neither Maximilian\r\nnor Lucchesi was in Bonn; in 1786 Beethoven’s skill would no longer\r\nhave astonished the chapelmaster. Of the other characteristic anecdotes\r\nrelated of Beethoven’s youth there is not one which belongs to this\r\nperiod (May, 1784-April, 1787), although some have been attributed to\r\nit by previous writers.\r\n\r\nNothing is to be added to the record already made except that, on\r\nthe authority of Stephan von Breuning, the youth was once a pupil of\r\nFranz Ries on the violin, which must have been at this time; that,\r\naccording to Wegeler, his composition of the song “Wenn Jemand eine\r\nReise thut”[33] fell in this period, and that he wrote three pianoforte\r\nquartets, the original manuscript of which bore the following title:\r\n“Trois Quatuors pour Clavecin, violino, viola e basso. 1785. Composé\r\npar (de L.) Louis van Beethoven, âgé 13 ans.”[34] The reader will\r\nremark and understand the discrepancy here between the date and the\r\nauthor’s age. Were these quartets intended for publication and for\r\ndedication to Max Franz, as the sonatas had been for Max Friedrich?\r\nDuring their author’s life they never saw the light, but their\r\nprincipal themes, even an entire movement, became parts of future\r\nworks. They were published in 1832 by Artaria and appear as Nos. 75 and\r\n77, Series 10, in the Complete Works.\r\n\r\nOne family event is recorded in the parish register of St.\r\nRemigius--the baptism of Maria Margaretha Josepha, daughter of Johann\r\nvan Beethoven, on May 5, 1786.\r\n\r\nThere is a letter from Bonn, dated April 8, 1787, in “Cramer’s\r\nMagazine” (II, 1385), which contains a passing allusion to Beethoven.\r\nIt affords another glimpse of the musical life there:\r\n\r\n     Our residence city is becoming more and more attractive for\r\n     music-lovers through the gracious patronage of our beloved\r\n     Elector. He has a large collection of the most beautiful music\r\n     and is expending much every day to augment it. It is to him,\r\n     too, that we owe the privilege of hearing often virtuosi on\r\n     various instruments. Good singers come seldom. The love of music\r\n     is increasing greatly among the inhabitants. The pianoforte is\r\n     especially liked; there are here several _Hammerclaviere_ by Stein\r\n     of Augsburg, and other correspondingly good instruments.... The\r\n     youthful Baron v. Gudenau plays the pianoforte right bravely, and\r\n     besides young Beethoven, the children of the chapelmaster deserve\r\n     to be mentioned because of their admirable and precociously\r\n     developed talent. All of the sons of Herr v. Mastiaux play the\r\n     clavier well, as you already know from earlier letters of mine.\r\n\r\n“This young genius deserves support to enable him to travel,” wrote\r\nNeefe in 1783. In the springtime of 1787 the young “genius” was at\r\nlength enabled to travel. Whence or how he obtained the means to\r\ndefray the expenses of his journey, whether aided by the Elector or\r\nsome other Mæcenas, or dependent upon the small savings from his\r\nsalary and--hardly possible--from the savings from his music lessons\r\npainfully and carefully hoarded for the purpose, does not appear. The\r\nseries of papers at Düsseldorf is at this point broken; so that not\r\neven the petition for leave of absence has been discovered. The few\r\nindications bearing on this point are that he had no farther aid from\r\nthe Elector than the continued payment of his salary. What is certain\r\nis that the youth, now sixteen, but passing for a year or two younger,\r\nvisited Vienna, where he received a few lessons from Mozart (Ries, in\r\n“Notizen,” page 86); that his stay was short, and that on his way home\r\nhe was forced to borrow some money in Augsburg.\r\n\r\nWhen he made the journey is equally doubtful. Schindler was told by\r\nsome old acquaintances of Beethoven “that on the visit two persons only\r\nwere deeply impressed upon the lifelong memory of the youth of sixteen\r\nyears: the Emperor Joseph and Mozart.” If the young artist really had\r\nan interview with the Emperor it must have occurred before the 11th\r\nof April, or after the 30th of June, for those were the days which\r\nbegan and ended Joseph’s absence from Vienna upon his famous tour to\r\nthe Crimea with the Russian Empress Catharine; if before that absence,\r\nthen Beethoven was at least three months in the Austrian capital and\r\nhad left Bonn before the date of Neefe’s letter to “Cramer’s Magazine”;\r\nin which case how could the writer in speaking of his young colleague\r\nhave omitted all mention of the fact? How, too, could so important a\r\ncircumstance have been unknown to or forgotten by Dr. Wegeler and have\r\nfound no place in his “Notizen,” which moreover, were prepared under\r\nthe eyes of both Franz Ries and Madame von Breuning? It will soon be\r\nseen that Beethoven was again in Bonn before July 17--a date which\r\nadmits the bare possibility of the reported meeting with Joseph after\r\nhis return from Russia.\r\n\r\nIf an opinion, which, indeed, is little more than a conjecture, may\r\nbe hazarded in relation with this visit, it is this: that if at any\r\ntime the missing archives of Maximilian’s court should come to light\r\nit will be found that not until after the busy week for organists\r\nand chapelmusicians ending with Easter was leave of absence granted\r\nto Beethoven; and that, too, with no farther pecuniary aid from the\r\nElector than possibly a quarter or two of his salary in advance. In\r\n1787, Easter Monday fell upon the 9th of April, the day after the date\r\nof Neefe’s letter. Making due allowance of time for the necessary\r\npreparations for so important a journey, as in those days it was from\r\nBonn to Vienna, it may be reasonably conjectured that some time in May\r\nthe youth reached the latter city.\r\n\r\nLet another conjecture find place here: it is that Johann van Beethoven\r\nhad not yet abandoned the hope of deriving pecuniary profit from the\r\nprecocity of his son’s genius; that he still expected the boy, after\r\nreplacing his hard organ-style of playing by one more suited to the\r\ncharacter of the pianoforte, to make his dream of a wonder-child in\r\nsome degree a reality. Hence--at what fearful cost to the father in his\r\npoverty we know not--Ludwig is sent to the most admirable pianist, the\r\nbest teacher then living, Mozart.\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN’S INTRODUCTION TO MOZART\r\n\r\nBut enough of conjecture. The oft-repeated anecdote of Beethoven’s\r\nintroduction to Mozart is stripped by Prof. Jahn of Seyfried’s\r\nsuperlatives and related in these terms:\r\n\r\n     Beethoven, who as a youth of great promise came to Vienna in\r\n     1786 (?)[35], but was obliged to return to Bonn after a brief\r\n     sojourn, was taken to Mozart and at that musician’s request played\r\n     something for him which he, taking it for granted that it was a\r\n     show-piece prepared for the occasion, praised in a rather cool\r\n     manner. Beethoven observing this, begged Mozart to give him a\r\n     theme for improvization. He always played admirably when excited\r\n     and now he was inspired, too, by the presence of the master whom\r\n     he reverenced greatly; he played in such a style that Mozart,\r\n     whose attention and interest grew more and more, finally went\r\n     silently to some friends who were sitting in an adjoining room,\r\n     and said, vivaciously, “Keep your eyes on him; some day he will\r\n     give the world something to talk about.”\r\n\r\nRies (“Notizen,” p. 86) merely says: “During his visit to Vienna he\r\nreceived some instruction from Mozart, but the latter, as Beethoven\r\nlamented, never played for him.” Contrary to the conjecture above\r\nmentioned as to Johann van Beethoven’s object in sending his son to\r\nVienna, it seems, from the connection in which Ries introduces this\r\nremark, that the instruction given by Mozart to the youth was confined\r\nto composition. The lessons given were few--a fact which accounts for\r\nthe circumstance that no member of Mozart’s family in after years,\r\nwhen Beethoven had become world-renowned, has spoken of them.\r\n\r\nIf it be considered that poor Mozart lost his beloved father on May 28,\r\n1787, and that his mind was then fully occupied with his new operatic\r\nsubject, “Don Giovanni,” it will not be thought strange that he did\r\nnot exhibit his powers as a pianist to a youth just beginning with\r\nhim a course of study in composition, especially as the pupil, in his\r\neyes, was a little, undersized boy of 14--as there is every reason to\r\nbelieve. That pupil’s power of handling a theme, since Mozart probably\r\nknew nothing of his five years’ practice at the organ and in the\r\ntheatre, may well have surprised him; but in execution as a pianist he\r\nprobably stood far, far below the master when at the same age, below\r\nthe little Hummel (at that very time an inmate of Mozart’s family),\r\nand certainly below Cesarius Scheidl (forgotten name!) aged ten, who\r\nhad played a pianoforte concerto between the parts of an oratorio no\r\nlonger ago than the preceding 22nd of December in the grand concert of\r\nthe “Society of Musicians.” Had not Beethoven’s visit been so abruptly,\r\nunexpectedly and sorrowfully brought to an end, he would, doubtless,\r\nhave had nothing to regret on the score of his master’s playing.\r\n\r\nIn some written talks to Beethoven in the years of his deafness, still\r\npreserved, are found two allusions at least made by his nephew to this\r\npersonal acquaintance with Mozart. In the first case the words are\r\nthese: “You knew Mozart; where did you see him?” In the other, two or\r\nthree years later: “Was Mozart a good pianoforte player? It was then\r\nstill in its infancy.” Of course Beethoven’s replies are wanting; and\r\nherewith is exhausted all that, during the researches for this work,\r\nhas been found relating to his first visit in Vienna. The Vienna\r\nnewspapers of the time contained notices of the “wonder-children”\r\nHummel and Scheidl, but none whatever of Beethoven.\r\n\r\nACQUAINTANCES IN AUGSBURG\r\n\r\nThat the youth in passing through Augsburg must have become acquainted\r\nwith the pianoforte-maker Stein and his family is self-evident. There\r\nis something in a conversation-book which seems to prove this, and\r\nalso to add evidence to the falsification of his age. It is this: in\r\nthe spring of 1824 Andreas Streicher and his wife--the same Stein’s\r\n“Mädl”--whose appearance at the pianoforte when a child of eight\r\nand a half years is so piquantly described by Mozart, called upon\r\nBeethoven on their way from Vienna into the country. A few sentences\r\nof the conversation, written in the hand of the composer’s nephew,\r\nare preserved. The topic for a time is the packing of movables and\r\nBeethoven’s removal into country lodgings for the summer; and at\r\nlength they come upon the instruments manufactured by Streicher; after\r\nwhich Carl writes: “Frau von Streicher says that she is delighted that\r\nat 14 years of age you saw the instruments made by her father and\r\nnow see those of her son.” True, it may be said that this refers to\r\nBeethoven’s knowledge of the Stein “Hammerclaviere” then in Bonn; but\r\nto any one thoroughly conversant with the subject these words are, like\r\nIago’s “trifles light as air,” confirmation strong of the other view.\r\nHis introduction to the family of the advocate Dr. Schaden in Augsburg,\r\nis certain. Reichardt was in that city in 1790 and wrote of Frau\r\nNanette von Schaden as being of all the women he knew, those of Paris\r\nnot excepted, far and away the greatest pianoforte player, not excelled\r\nperhaps, by any virtuoso in skill and certainty; also a singer with\r\nmuch expression and excellent declamation--“in every respect an amiable\r\nand interesting woman.” The earliest discovered letter of Beethoven\r\nto Schaden, and dated Bonn, September 15, 1787, proves the friendship\r\nof the Schadens for him and fully explains the causes of his sudden\r\ndeparture from Vienna and the abrupt termination of his studies with\r\nMozart.\r\n\r\n     I can easily imagine what you must think of me, and I can not deny\r\n     that you have good grounds for an unfavorable opinion. I shall\r\n     not, however, attempt to justify myself, until I have explained\r\n     to you the reasons why I hope my apologies will be accepted. I\r\n     must tell you that from the time I left Augsburg my cheerfulness\r\n     as well as my health began to decline; the nearer I came to my\r\n     native city the more frequent were the letters from my father\r\n     urging me to travel with all possible speed, as my mother was\r\n     not in a favorable state of health. I therefore hurried forward\r\n     as fast as I could, although myself far from well. My longing\r\n     once more to see my dying mother overcame every obstacle and\r\n     assisted me in surmounting the greatest difficulties. I found my\r\n     mother still alive but in the most deplorable state; her disease\r\n     was consumption, and about seven weeks ago, after much pain and\r\n     suffering, she died. She was such a kind, loving mother to me,\r\n     and my best friend. Ah, who was happier than I when I could still\r\n     utter the sweet name, mother, and it was heard? And to whom can\r\n     I now speak it? Only to the silent image resembling her evoked\r\n     by the power of the imagination. I have passed very few pleasant\r\n     hours since my arrival here, having during the whole time been\r\n     suffering from asthma, which may, I fear, eventually develop into\r\n     consumption; to this is added melancholy--almost as great an evil\r\n     as my malady itself. Imagine yourself in my place, and then I\r\n     shall hope to receive your forgiveness for my long silence. You\r\n     showed me extreme kindness and friendship by lending me three\r\n     Carolins in Augsburg, but I must entreat your indulgence for a\r\n     time. My journey cost me a great deal, and I have not the smallest\r\n     hopes of earning anything here. Fate is not propitious to me in\r\n     Bonn.\r\n\r\n     Pardon my detaining you so long with my chatter; it was necessary\r\n     for my justification.\r\n\r\n     I do entreat you not to deprive me of your valuable friendship;\r\n     nothing do I wish so much as in some degree to become worthy of\r\n     your regard.\r\n\r\n    I am, with the highest respect\r\n    Your most obedient servant and friend,\r\n    L. v. Beethoven,\r\n    Court Organist to the Elector of Cologne.[36]\r\n\r\nDEATH OF BEETHOVEN’S MOTHER\r\n\r\nThe Bonn “Intelligenzblatt” supplies a pendant to this sad\r\nletter:--“1787, July 17. Died, Maria Magdalena Koverich (_sic_), named\r\nvan Beethoven, aged 49 years.”[37] When Ferdinand Ries, some thirteen\r\nyears later, presented his father’s letter of introduction to Beethoven\r\nin Vienna, the latter “read the letter through” and said: “I cannot\r\nanswer your father just now; but do you write to him that I have not\r\nforgotten how my mother died. He will be satisfied with that.” “Later,”\r\nadds Ries, “I learned that, the family being greatly in need, my father\r\nhad been helpful to him on this occasion in every way.”\r\n\r\nA petition of Johann van Beethoven, offered before the death of his\r\nwife, describing his pitiable condition and asking aid from the\r\nElector, has not been discovered; but the substance of it is found in a\r\nvolume of “Geheime Staats-Protocolle” for 1787 in form following:\r\n\r\n     July 24, 1787\r\n\r\n     Your Elec. Highness has taken possession of this petition.\r\n\r\n     Court Musician makes obedient representation that he has got into\r\n     a very unfortunate state because of the long-continued sickness of\r\n     his wife and has already been compelled to sell a portion of his\r\n     effects and pawn others and that he no longer knows what to do for\r\n     his sick wife and many children. He prays for the benefaction of\r\n     an advance of 100 rthlr. on his salary.\r\n\r\nNo record is found in the Düsseldorf archives of any grant of aid\r\nto the distressed family; hence, so far as now appears, the only\r\nsuccessful appeal for assistance was made to Franz Ries, then a young\r\nman of 32 years, who generously aided in “every way” his unfortunate\r\ncolleague. Where then was the Breuning family? Where Graf Waldstein?\r\nTo these questions the reply is that Beethoven was still unknown to\r\nthem--a reply which involves the utter rejection of the chronology\r\nadopted by Dr. Wegeler, in his “Notizen,” of that part of the\r\ncomposer’s life. This mistake, if indeed it prove to be such, is one\r\nwhich has been adopted without hesitation by all who have written upon\r\nthe subject. The reader here, for the first time, finds Wegeler’s\r\naccount of Beethoven’s higher intellectual development and his\r\nintroduction into a more refined social circle placed after, instead of\r\nbefore, the visit to Vienna; and his introduction to the Breunings and\r\nWaldstein dated at the time when the youth was developing into the man,\r\nand not at a point upon the confines of childhood and youth.\r\n\r\nThis demands some explanation.\r\n\r\nDR. WEGELER’S CHRONOLOGY CORRECTED\r\n\r\nThe history of Beethoven’s Bonn life would be so sadly imperfect\r\nwithout the “Notizen” of Dr. Wegeler, which bear in every line such\r\nan impress of perfect candor and honesty, that they can be read only\r\nwith feelings of gratefullest remembrance of their author and with\r\nfullest confidence in their authenticity. But no more in his case than\r\nin others can the reminiscences of an aged man be taken as conclusive\r\nevidence in regard to facts and occurrences of years long since past,\r\nwhen opposed to contemporary records, or involving confusion of dates.\r\nSome slight lapse of memory, misapprehension, or unlucky adoption of\r\nanother’s mistake, may lead astray and be the abundant source of error.\r\nStill, it is only with great diffidence and extreme caution that one\r\ncan undertake to correct an original authority so trustworthy as Dr.\r\nWegeler. Such corrections must be made, however; for only by this can\r\nmany a difficulty be removed. An error in the Doctor’s chronology might\r\neasily be occasioned by the long accepted false date of Beethoven’s\r\nbirth, insensibly influencing his recollections; and certainly when Dr.\r\nWegeler, Madame von Breuning and Franz Ries, all alike venerable in\r\nyears as in character, sit together discussing in 1837-8 occurrences\r\nof 1785-8, with nothing to aid their memories or control their\r\nreminiscences but an old Court Calendar or two, they may well to\r\nsome extent have confounded times and seasons in the vague and misty\r\ndistance of so many years; the more easily because the error is one\r\nof but two or three years at most. Bearing upon the point in question\r\nis the fact that Frau Karth--who distinctly remembers the death of\r\nMadame van Beethoven--has no recollections of the young Breunings and\r\nWaldstein until after that event.\r\n\r\nSome words of Dr. Wegeler in an unprinted letter to Beethoven (1825):\r\n“inasmuch as the house of my mother-in-law was more your domicile than\r\nyour own, especially after you lost your noble mother,” seem to favor\r\nthe usually accepted chronology: but if Beethoven was thus almost a\r\nmember of the Breuning family as early as 1785 or 1786, how can the\r\ntone of the letter to Dr. Schaden be explained? Or how account for the\r\nfact, that, when he reached Bonn again and found his mother dying,\r\nand his father “in a very unfortunate state” and “compelled to sell\r\na portion of his effects and pawn others and knew not what to do,”\r\nit was to Franz Ries he turned for aid? The good Doctor is certainly\r\nmistaken as to the time when Beethoven found Mæcenases in the Elector\r\nand Waldstein; why not equally so in relation to the Breuning family?\r\n\r\nIf, now, his own account of his intimacy with the young musician--given\r\nin the preface to the “Notizen”--be examined, it will be found to\r\nstrengthen what has just been said: “Born in Bonn in 1765, I became\r\nacquainted in 1782 with the twelve years old lad, who, however, was\r\nalready known as an author, and lived in most intimate association\r\nwith him uninterruptedly until September, 1787” (and still he could\r\nforget that friend’s absence in Vienna only a few months before),\r\n“when, to finish my medical studies, I visited the Vienna schools\r\nand institutions. After my return in October, 1789, we continued to\r\nlive together in an equally cordial association until Beethoven’s\r\nlater departure for Vienna towards the close of 1792, whither I also\r\nemigrated in October, 1794.”\r\n\r\nFor more than two years, then, and just at this period, Dr. Wegeler was\r\nnot in Bonn. Let still another circumstance be noted: Nothing has been\r\ndiscovered, either in the “Notizen” or elsewhere, which necessarily\r\nimplies that Wegeler himself intimately knew the Breunings until after\r\nhis return from Vienna in 1789; moreover, in those days, when the\r\ndistinctions of rank were so strongly marked, it is, to say the least,\r\nexceedingly improbable, that the son of an immigrant Alsatian shoemaker\r\nshould have obtained entrée upon the supposed terms of intimacy in a\r\nhousehold in which the oldest child was some six years younger than\r\nhimself, and which belonged to the highest social, if not titled rank,\r\nuntil he by the force of his talents, culture, and high character, had\r\nrisen to its level. That, after so rising, the obscurity of his birth\r\nwas forgotten and the only daughter became his wife, is alike honorable\r\nto both parties. It is unnecessary to pursue the point farther; the\r\nreader, having his attention drawn to it, will observe for himself the\r\nmany less prominent, but strongly corroborating circumstances of the\r\nnarrative, which confirm the chronology adopted in it. At all events\r\nit must stand until new and decisive facts against it be found.[38]\r\n\r\nA YEAR OF SADNESS AND GLOOM\r\n\r\n“My journey cost me a great deal, and I have not the smallest hope\r\nof earning anything here. Fate is not propitious to me in Bonn.” In\r\npoverty, ill, melancholy, despondent, motherless, ashamed of and\r\ndepressed by his father’s ever increasing moral infirmity, the boy,\r\nprematurely old from the circumstances in which he had been placed\r\nsince his eleventh year, had yet to bear another “sling and arrow of\r\noutrageous fortune.” The little sister, now a year and a half old--but\r\nhere is the notice from the “Intelligenzblatt”:--“Died, November 25,\r\nMargareth, daughter of the Court Musician Johann van Beethoven, aged\r\none year.” And so faded the last hope that the passionate tenderness\r\nof Beethoven’s nature might find scope in the purest of all relations\r\nbetween the sexes--that of brother and sister.\r\n\r\nThus, in sadness and gloom, Beethoven’s seventeenth year ended.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[32] Czerny also related that Beethoven had spoken to him of the harsh\r\ntreatment and insufficient instruction received from his father. “But,”\r\nhe added, “I had talent for music.” From a note by Otto Jahn. Also see\r\nCock’s “Musical Miscellany.”\r\n\r\n[33] “Urian’s Reise um die Welt.” Op. 52, No. 1, published in 1805.\r\n\r\n[34] The manuscript formerly owned by Artaria is now (1907) in the\r\npossession of Dr. E. Prieger in Bonn. The figure indicating the\r\ncomposer’s age was first written “14” and then changed.\r\n\r\n[35] In the first edition of Jahn’s “Mozart” the date is given as\r\nhere. In later editions it was corrected in accordance with Thayer’s\r\nsuggestion to 1787.\r\n\r\n[36] Lady Wallace’s translation, amended. The letter is preserved in\r\nthe Beethoven-Haus Museum in Bonn.\r\n\r\n[37] The age of Beethoven’s mother at the time of her death is here\r\nincorrectly given. It should be 40.\r\n\r\n[38] Thayer’s correction of Dr. Wegeler’s account of Beethoven’s first\r\nacquaintance with the family von Breuning was sharply criticized by a\r\ngrandson of Wegeler in an article published in the _Coblenzer Zeitung_\r\nof May 20, 1890. Thayer preserved Karl Wegeler’s article in the library\r\ncopy of his biography, and had he lived to revise his work he would\r\nundoubtedly either have corrected his assertions or confirmed them.\r\nAccording to Dr. Wegeler (this is the younger Wegeler’s argument,\r\nin brief), Beethoven had been introduced to the von Breuning family\r\nat least as early as 1785, and in that circle had already met Count\r\nWaldstein, who had aided him in securing his first salary as Court\r\nOrganist. The “Notizen” do not fix the dates, though they imply that\r\nthe occurrences took place before 1785. As to the statement of the\r\nWidow Karth, Wegeler urges that the testimony of a child five years old\r\ncould have no weight as against that of persons of mature age, and that\r\nan acquaintance might well exist without intercourse in the Beethoven\r\ndwelling. The letter to Dr. Schaden, the product of a melancholy mood,\r\ndoes not preclude the possibility that Beethoven had received help\r\nfrom another source, especially since great care had to be exercised\r\nin extending succor to him lest his sensibilities be hurt. Certain\r\nit is that Wegeler, who did not go to Vienna till 1787, had been a\r\nfaithful friend and helper in the period of Beethoven’s destitution,\r\nas was proved by a thitherto unpublished letter of Beethoven to\r\nWegeler, in which the former expressly stated that the latter had known\r\nhim, Beethoven, almost since childhood. If the von Breuning family\r\nwere really not on hand at the time of Beethoven’s trouble, the fact\r\nmight be explained by their annual sojourn in the country, which was\r\ngenerally of considerable duration. Thayer’s assumption that Wegeler\r\nhimself did not get intimately acquainted with the von Breunings until\r\nafter his return from Vienna (in 1789) is at variance with the family\r\nrecollections, which presented him as a young student (therefore before\r\n1787) and with him Beethoven at the time when they became visitors at\r\nthe house. Weakness of memory on the part of a man so intellectually\r\nfresh and vigorous as Dr. Wegeler was in 1838 (he died ten years\r\nlater) was not to be assumed; least of all can Dr. Wegeler have erred\r\nconcerning the beginning of his acquaintance with the family from\r\nwhich he got his wife. Finally, the intimate terms of friendship which\r\nexisted between Beethoven and Eleonore von Breuning could be fully\r\nexplained only on the theory of a childhood acquaintance.\r\n\r\nIn the first edition of Thayer’s biography (1866) Dr. Deiters printed\r\nthe text bearing on this question as it is given above without note or\r\ncomment. In the revised edition of Volume I (1901), he reproduced the\r\noriginal text in the body of the page but appended a footnote in which,\r\nwhile asserting that an authority like Thayer ought not to be opposed\r\nexcept “with great diffidence and extreme caution” (to use Thayer’s\r\nwords referring to Dr. Wegeler), he nevertheless upheld the contention\r\nof Dr. Wegeler’s grandson. He says: “The definite assertion of Wegeler\r\nthat he made the acquaintance of Beethoven as early as 1782, which\r\nis supported by Beethoven’s own words, ‘you knew me almost since my\r\nchildhood,’ is not to be shaken. As little can it be questioned that\r\nWegeler had been introduced in the Breuning house as a student before\r\nhis departure for Vienna (according to Gerhard von Breuning before his\r\nacquaintance with Beethoven began); here Dr. Wegeler could not have\r\nmade an error. Concerning his bringing Beethoven to the house he gives\r\nno date; the year 1785 is not mentioned in the “Notizen.” On page 45,\r\nhowever, it is stated that Stephan von Breuning “lived in closest\r\naffiliation with him (Beethoven) from his tenth year till his death.”\r\nStephan was born August 17, 1774 (_Vide_ “Aus dem Schwarzspanierhause,”\r\npage 6); this would indicate the year 1784. Wegeler’s remark,\r\n“especially after you lost your noble mother,” makes it clear as day\r\nthat a close friendship existed before the death of Beethoven’s mother.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII\r\n\r\n     The von Breuning Family--Beethoven Brought Under Refining\r\n     Influences--Count Waldstein, His Mæcenas--The Young Musician is\r\n     Forced to Become Head of the Family.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1527, the year in which the administration of the office of\r\n_Hochmeister_ of the Teutonic Order was united with that of the\r\n_Deutschmeister_, whose residence had already been fixed at Mergentheim\r\nin 1525, this city became the principal seat of the order. From\r\n1732 to 1761 Clemens Augustus was _Hoch- und Deutschmeister_ of the\r\norder; according to the French edition of the Court Calendar of 1761,\r\nChristoph von Breuning was _Conseiller d’État et Référendaire_, having\r\nsucceeded his father-in-law von Mayerhofen in the office.\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN’S FRIENDS: THE VON BREUNINGS\r\n\r\nChristoph von Breuning had five sons: Georg Joseph, Johann Lorenz,\r\nJohann Philipp, Emanuel Joseph and Christoph. Lorenz became chancellor\r\nof the Archdeanery of Bonn, and the _Freiadliges Stift_ at Neuss; after\r\nthe death of his brother Emanuel he lived in Bonn so that, as head of\r\nthe family, he might care for the education of the latter’s children.\r\nHe died there in 1796. Johann Philipp, born 1742 at Mergentheim, became\r\ncanon and priest at Kerpen, a place on the old highway from Cologne\r\nto Aix-la-Chapelle, where he died June 12, 1831. Christoph was court\r\ncouncillor at Dillingen.\r\n\r\nEmanuel Joseph continued in the electoral service at Bonn; at the early\r\nage of 20 years he was already court councillor (_Conseiller actuel_).\r\nHe married Hélène von Kerich, born January 3, 1750, daughter of Stephan\r\nvon Kerich, physician to the elector. Her brother, Abraham von Kerich,\r\ncanon and scholaster of the archdeanery of Bonn, died in Coblenz in\r\n1821. A high opinion of the intellect and character of Madame von\r\nBreuning is enforced upon us by what we learn of her influence upon\r\nthe youthful Beethoven. Court Councillor von Breuning perished in a\r\nfire in the electoral palace on January 15, 1777. The young widow (she\r\nhad barely attained her 28th year), continued to live in the house of\r\nher brother, Abraham von Kerich, with her three children, to whom was\r\nadded a fourth in the summer of 1777. Immediately after the death of\r\nthe father, his brother, the canon Lorenz von Breuning, changed his\r\nresidence from Neuss to Bonn and remained in the same house as guardian\r\nand tutor of the orphaned children. These were:\r\n\r\n1. Christoph, born May 13, 1771, a student of jurisprudence at Bonn,\r\nGöttingen and Jena, municipal councillor in Bonn, notary, president of\r\nthe city council, professor at the law school in Coblenz, member of the\r\nCourt of Review in Cologne, and, finally, _Geheimer Ober-Revisionsrath_\r\nin Berlin. He died in 1841.\r\n\r\n2. Eleonore Brigitte, born April 23, 1772. On March 28, 1802, she was\r\nmarried to Franz Gerhard Wegeler of Beul-an-der-Ahr, and died on June\r\n13, 1841, at Coblenz.\r\n\r\n3. Stephan, born August 17, 1774. He studied law at Bonn and Göttingen,\r\nand shortly before the end of the electorship of Max Franz was\r\nappointed to an office in the Teutonic Order at Mergentheim. In the\r\nspring of 1801 he went to Vienna, where he renewed his acquaintance\r\nwith Beethoven. They had simultaneously been pupils of Ries in violin\r\nplaying. The Teutonic Order offering no chance of advancement to a\r\nyoung man, he was given employment with the War Council and became\r\nCourt Councillor in 1818. He died on June 4, 1827. His first wife\r\nwas Julie von Vering, daughter of Ritter von Vering, a military\r\nphysician; she died in the eleventh month of her wedded life. He then\r\nmarried Constanze Ruschowitz, who became the mother of Dr. Gerhard von\r\nBreuning, born August 28, 1813, author of “Aus dem Schwarzspanierhause.”\r\n\r\n4. Lorenz (called Lenz, the posthumous child), born in the summer of\r\n1777, studied medicine and was in Vienna in 1794-97 simultaneously with\r\nWegeler and Beethoven. He died on April 10, 1798 in Bonn.[39]\r\n\r\nMadame von Breuning, who died on December 9, 1838, after a widowhood of\r\n61 years, lived in Bonn until 1815, then in Kerpen, Beul-an-der-Ahr,\r\nCologne and finally with her son-in-law, Wegeler, in Coblenz.\r\n\r\nThe acquaintance between Beethoven and Stephan von Breuning may have\r\nhad some influence in the selection of the young musician as pianoforte\r\nteacher for Eleonore and Lorenz,[40] an event (in consideration of\r\ncircumstances already detailed and of the ages, real and reputed,\r\nof pupils and master) which may be dated at the close of the year\r\n1787, and which was, perhaps, the greatest good that fate, now become\r\npropitious, could have conferred upon him; for he was now so situated\r\nin his domestic relations, and at such an age, that introduction into\r\nso highly refined and cultivated a circle was of the highest value to\r\nhim both morally and intellectually. The recent loss of his mother\r\nhad left a void in his heart which so excellent a woman as Madame\r\nvon Breuning could alone in some measure fill. He was at an age when\r\nthe evil example of his father needed a counterbalance; when the\r\nextraordinary honors so recently paid to science and letters at the\r\ninauguration of the university would make the strongest impression;\r\nwhen the sense of his deficiencies in everything but his art would\r\nbegin to be oppressive; when his mental powers, so strong and healthy,\r\nwould demand some change, some recreation, from that constant strain in\r\nthe one direction of music to which almost from infancy they had been\r\nsubjected; when not only the reaction upon his mind of the fresh and\r\nnew intellectual life now pervading Bonn society, but his daily contact\r\nwith so many of his own age, friends and companions now enjoying\r\nadvantages for improvement denied to him, must have cost him many a\r\npang; when a lofty and noble ambition might be aroused to lead him\r\never onward and upward; when, the victim of a despondent melancholy,\r\nhe might sink into the mere routine musician, with no lofty aims,\r\nno higher object than to draw from his talents means to supply his\r\nnecessities and gratify his appetites.\r\n\r\nThere must have been something very engaging in the character of the\r\nsmall, pockmarked youth, or he could not have so won his way into the\r\naffections of the Widow von Breuning and her children. In his “Notizen”\r\nWegeler writes:\r\n\r\n     In this house reigned an unconstrained tone of culture in spite\r\n     of youthful wilfulness. Christoph von Breuning made early\r\n     essays in poetry, as was the case (and not without success)\r\n     with Stephan von Breuning much later. The friends of the family\r\n     were distinguished by indulgence in social entertainments which\r\n     combined the useful and the agreeable. When we add that the family\r\n     possessed considerable wealth, especially before the war, it will\r\n     be easy to understand that the first joyous emotions of Beethoven\r\n     found vent here. Soon he was treated as one of the children of\r\n     the family, spending in the house not only the greater part of\r\n     his days, but also many nights. Here he felt that he was free,\r\n     here he moved about without constraint, everything conspired to\r\n     make him cheerful and develop his mind. Being five years older\r\n     than Beethoven I was able to observe and form a judgment on these\r\n     things.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that besides Madame von Breuning and her\r\nchildren the scholastic Abraham von Kerich and the canon Lorenz von\r\nBreuning were members of the household. The latter especially seems\r\nto have been a fine specimen of the enlightened clergy of Bonn who,\r\naccording to Risbeck, formed so striking a contrast to the priests\r\nand monks of Cologne; and it is easy to trace Beethoven’s life-long\r\nlove for the ancient classics--Homer and Plutarch at the head--to\r\nthe time when the young Breunings would be occupied with them in the\r\noriginal under the guidance of their accomplished tutor and guardian.\r\nThe uncle, Philipp von Breuning, may also have been influential in the\r\nintellectual progress of the young musician, for to him at Kerpen “the\r\nfamily von Breuning and their friends went annually for a vacation of\r\nfive or six weeks. There, too, Beethoven several times spent a few\r\nweeks right merrily, and was frequently urged to play the organ,” as\r\nWegeler tells us in the “Notizen.” There let him be left enjoying\r\nand profiting by his intimacy with that family, and returning their\r\nkindness in some measure by instructing Eleonore and Lenz in music,\r\nwhile a new friend and benefactor is introduced.\r\n\r\nCOUNT WALDSTEIN’S ARRIVAL IN BONN\r\n\r\nEmanuel Philipp, Count Waldstein and Wartemberg von Dux, and his wife,\r\na daughter of Emanuel Prince Lichtenstein, were parents of eleven\r\nchildren. The fourth son was Ferdinand Ernst Gabriel, born March 24,\r\n1762. Uniting in his veins the blood of many of the houses of the\r\nAustrian Empire, there was no career, no line of preferment open to\r\nyounger sons of titled families, which was not open to him, or to which\r\nhe might not aspire. It was determined that he should seek activity\r\nin the Teutonic Order, of which Max Franz was Grand Master. According\r\nto the rules and regulations of the order, the young nobleman came to\r\nBonn to pass his examinations and spend his year of novitiate. Could\r\nthe time of his arrival there be determined with certainty, the date\r\nwould have a most important bearing either to confirm or disprove the\r\nchronological argument of some of our earlier pages; but one may well\r\ndespair of finding so unimportant an event as the journey of a young\r\nman of 25 from Vienna to the Rhine anywhere upon record. One thing\r\nbearing directly upon this point may be read in the “Wiener Zeitung”\r\nof July 2, 1788. A correspondent in Bonn says that on “the day before\r\nyesterday,” i.e., June 17, 1788, “our gracious sovereign, as Hoch- und\r\nDeutschmeister, gave the accolade with the customary ceremonies to the\r\nCount von Waldstein, who had been accepted in the Teutonic Order.”\r\nAllowing for the regular year of novitiate, the Count was certainly in\r\nBonn before the 17th of June, 1787.\r\n\r\nThe misfortune of two unlucky Bohemian peasants, strange as it may\r\nseem, gives us, after the lapse of a century, a satisfactory solution\r\nof the difficulty. Some one reports in the “Wiener Zeitung” of May, 19,\r\n1787, that on the 4th of that month two peasant houses were destroyed\r\nby fire in the village of Likwitz belonging to Osegg, and adds: “Count\r\nFerdinand von Waldstein, moved by a noble spirit of humanity, hurried\r\nfrom Dux, took charge of affairs and was to be found wherever the\r\ndanger was greatest.” It was between May 4 and June 17, 1787, that\r\nWaldstein parted from his widowed mother and journeyed to the place of\r\nhis novitiate. His name may easily have become known to Wegeler before\r\nthe latter’s departure from Bonn for Vienna.[41] Here follows what the\r\ngood doctor says of the Count--to what degree correct or mistaken, the\r\nreader can determine for himself:\r\n\r\n     The first, and in every respect the most important, of the\r\n     Mæcenases of Beethoven was Count Waldstein, Knight of the Teutonic\r\n     Order, and (what is of greater moment here) the favorite and\r\n     constant companion of the young Elector, afterwards Commander of\r\n     the Order at Virnsberg and Chancellor of the Emperor of Austria.\r\n     He was not only a connoisseur but also a practitioner of music.\r\n     He it was who gave all manner of support to our Beethoven, whose\r\n     gifts he was the first to recognize worthily. Through him the\r\n     young genius developed the talent to improvise variations on\r\n     a given theme. From him he received much pecuniary assistance\r\n     bestowed in such a way as to spare his sensibilities, it being\r\n     generally looked upon as a small gratuity from the Elector.\r\n\r\n     Beethoven’s appointment as organist, his being sent to Vienna by\r\n     the Elector, were the doings of the Count. When Beethoven at a\r\n     later date dedicated the great and important Sonata in C major,\r\n     Op. 53, to him, it was only a proof of the gratitude which lived\r\n     on in the mature man. It is to Count Waldstein that Beethoven owed\r\n     the circumstance that the first sproutings of his genius were not\r\n     nipped; therefore we owe this Mæcenas Beethoven’s later fame.\r\n\r\nFrau Karth remembered distinctly the 17th of June upon which Waldstein\r\nentered the order, the fact being impressed upon her mind by a not very\r\ngentle reminder from the stock of a sentinel’s musket that the palace\r\nchapel was no place for children on such an occasion. She remembered\r\nWaldstein’s visits to Beethoven in the years following in his room in\r\nthe Wenzelgasse and was confident that he made the young musician a\r\npresent of a pianoforte.\r\n\r\nTo save his line from extinction the Count obtained a dispensation from\r\nhis vows and married (May 9, 1812) Maria Isabella, daughter of Count\r\nRzewski. A daughter, Ludmilla, was born to him; but no son. He died on\r\nAugust 29, 1823, and the family of Waldsteins of Dux disappears. While\r\nall that Wegeler says of this man’s kindness in obtaining the place of\r\norganist for Beethoven and of his influence upon his musical education\r\nis one grand mistake,[42] there is no reason whatever to doubt that\r\nthose qualities which made the youth a favorite with the Breunings,\r\nadded to his manifest genius, made their way to the young count’s\r\nheart and gained for Beethoven a zealous, influential and active\r\nfriend. Still, in June, 1778, Waldstein possessed no such influence as\r\nto render a petition for increase of salary, offered by his protégé,\r\nsuccessful. That document has disappeared, but a paper remains, dated\r\nJune 5, concerning the petition, which is endorsed “Beruhet.” Whatever\r\nthis word may here mean it is certain that Ludwig’s salary as organist\r\nremained at the old point of 100 thalers, which, with the 200 received\r\nby his father, the three measures of grain and the small sum that he\r\nmight earn by teaching, was all that Johann van Beethoven and three\r\nsons, now respectively in their eighteenth, fifteenth and twelfth\r\nyears, had to live upon; and therefore so much the more necessity for\r\nthe exercise of Waldstein’s generosity.\r\n\r\nLUDWIG THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY\r\n\r\nAfter the death of the mother, says Frau Karth, a housekeeper was\r\nemployed and the father and sons remained together in the lodgings in\r\nthe Wenzelgasse. Carl was intended for the musical profession; Johann\r\nwas put apprentice to the court apothecary, Johann Peter Hittorf.\r\nTwo years, however, had hardly elapsed when the father’s infirmity\r\ncompelled the eldest son, not yet nineteen years of age, to take the\r\nextraordinary step of placing himself at the head of the family. One of\r\nStephan von Breuning’s reminiscences shows how low Johann van Beethoven\r\nhad sunk: viz., that of having seen Ludwig furiously interposing to\r\nrescue his intoxicated father from an officer of police.\r\n\r\nHere again the petition has disappeared, but its contents are\r\nsufficiently made known by the terms of the decree dated November 20,\r\n1789:\r\n\r\n     His Electoral Highness having graciously granted the prayer of\r\n     the petitioner and dispensed henceforth wholly with the services\r\n     of his father, who is to withdraw to a village in the electorate,\r\n     it is graciously commanded that he be paid in accordance with\r\n     his wish only 100 rthr. of the annual salary which he has had\r\n     heretofore, beginning with the approaching new year, and that the\r\n     other 100 thlr. be paid to the suppliant’s son besides the salary\r\n     which he now draws and the three measures of grain for the support\r\n     of his brothers.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that there was no intention to enforce this decree\r\nin respect of the withdrawal of the father from Bonn, and that this\r\nclause was inserted _in terrorem_ in case he misbehaved himself; for\r\nhe continued, according to Frau Karth, to dwell with his children, and\r\nhis first receipt, still preserved, for the reduced salary is dated\r\nat Bonn--a circumstance, however, which alone would prove little or\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[39] Dr. Deiters, differing with Thayer on the subject of the date of\r\nthe beginning of the intimacy between Beethoven and the von Breuning\r\nfamily, omitted in the revised version of the Beethoven biography the\r\nauthor’s comments on the brief biographical data concerning the sons,\r\nwhich were as follows: “These dates, communicated by Dr. Gerhard, son\r\nof Stephan von Breuning, prove a singular inaccuracy in Wegeler’s\r\nremark (‘Nachtrag zur Notizen,’ page 26): ‘Lenz, as the youngest of the\r\nthree brothers, was nearest to Beethoven in age.’” Of Stephan he says:\r\n“Inasmuch as he had lived in intimate association with Beethoven from\r\nhis tenth year up to his death.” Many a proof of this general fact will\r\nhereafter appear; but whether this “intimate association” began quite\r\nso early is a question. The two were at the same time pupils of Franz\r\nRies on the violin, and they may well have become acquainted in 1785\r\nor 1786; but it was not favorable to extreme intimacy that four years’\r\ndifference existed in their ages; and that the one was but a schoolboy\r\nwhile the other was already an organist, an author and accustomed to\r\nmove among men.\r\n\r\n[40] Gerhard von Breuning would have it appear from a statement on\r\npage 6 of his book “Aus dem Schwarzspanierhause,” that Beethoven was\r\nrecommended to the von Breunings by Wegeler.\r\n\r\n[41] Dr. Wegeler’s grandson, in his criticism of Thayer’s assertions\r\nconcerning the date of the beginning of the acquaintance between\r\nBeethoven and the von Breunings, falls foul of even this ingenious\r\ndemonstration, saying that the incident of the conflagration might have\r\ntaken place when Count Waldstein was at home visiting his mother. He\r\ncould not believe that the Count had spent all of the first 24 years\r\nof his life at Dux in “idyllic solitude,” and argued that he might\r\nhave visited Bonn _for the first time_ at an earlier date than 1787.\r\nDr. Deiters held that the point was well taken; as if there was no\r\nalternative for the young count between “idyllic solitude” at Dux and a\r\nsojourn at Bonn!\r\n\r\n[42] Thus in Mr. Thayer’s original manuscript. Dr. Deiters omitted the\r\nremark in his revision, but it is here permitted to stand along with\r\nother controverted matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII\r\n\r\n     The National Theatre of Max Franz--Beethoven’s Artistic\r\n     Associates--Practical Experience in the Orchestra--The\r\n     “Ritterballet”--The Operatic Repertory of Five Years.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPERA UNDER ELECTOR MAX FRANZ\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1788, the mind of the Elector, Max Franz, was\r\noccupied with the project for forming a company of _Hofschauspieler;_\r\nin short, with the founding of a National Theatre upon the plan adopted\r\nby his predecessor in Bonn and by his brother Joseph in Vienna. His\r\nfinances were now in order, the administration of public affairs in\r\nable hands and working smoothly, and there was nothing to hinder\r\nhim from placing both music and theatre upon a better and permanent\r\nfooting; which he now proceeded to do. The Klos troupe, which had left\r\nCologne in March, played for a space in Bonn, and on its dispersal\r\nin the summer several of its better actors were engaged and added to\r\nothers who had already settled in Bonn. The only names which it is\r\nnecessary to mention here are those of significance in the history of\r\nBeethoven. Joseph Reicha was director; Neefe, pianist and stage-manager\r\nfor opera; in the orchestra were Franz Ries and Andreas Romberg\r\n(violin), Ludwig van Beethoven (viola), Bernard Romberg (violoncello),\r\nNicolaus Simrock (horn) and Anton Reicha (flute). A comparison of the\r\nlists of the theatrical establishment with that of the court chapel as\r\nprinted in the Court Calendars for 1778 and the following years, shows\r\nthat the two institutions were kept distinct, though the names for the\r\ngreater part appear in both. Some of the singers in the chapel played\r\nin the theatrical orchestra, while certain of the players in the chapel\r\nsang upon the stage. Other names appear in but one of the lists.\r\n\r\nAs organist the name of Beethoven appears still in the Court Calendar,\r\nbut as viola player he had a place in both the orchestras. Thus,\r\nfor a period of full four years, he had the opportunity of studying\r\npractically orchestral compositions in the best of all schools--the\r\norchestra itself. This body of thirty-one members, under the energetic\r\nleadership of Reicha, many of them young and ambitious, some already\r\nknown as virtuosos and still keeping their places in musical history as\r\nsuch, was a school for instrumental music such as Handel, Bach, Mozart\r\nand Haydn had not enjoyed in their youth; that its advantages were\r\nimproved both by Beethoven and others of the younger men, all the world\r\nknows.\r\n\r\nOne fact worthy of note in relation to this company is the youth of\r\nmost of the new members engaged. Maximilian seems to have sought\r\nout young talent, and when it proved to be of true metal, gave it\r\na permanent place in his service, adopted wise measures for its\r\ncultivation, and thus laid a foundation upon which, but for the\r\noutbreak of the French Revolution, and the consequent dispersion of his\r\ncourt, would in time have risen a musical establishment, one of the\r\nvery first in Germany.\r\n\r\nThis is equally true of the new members of his orchestra. Reicha\r\nhimself was still rather a young man, born in 1757. He was a virtuoso\r\non the violoncello and a composer of some note; but his usefulness was\r\nsadly impaired by his sufferings from gout. The cousins Andreas and\r\nBernhard Romberg, Maximilian had found at Münster and brought to Bonn.\r\nThey had in their boyhood, as virtuosos upon their instruments--Andreas\r\nviolin, Bernhard ’cello--made a tour as far as Paris, and their\r\nconcerts were crowned with success. Andreas was born near Münster in\r\n1767, and Ledebur (“Tonkünstler Berlins”) adopts the same year as the\r\ndate also of Bernhard’s birth. They were, therefore, three years older\r\nthan Beethoven and now just past 21. Both were already industrious and\r\nwell-known composers and must have been a valuable addition to the\r\ncircle of young men in which Beethoven moved. The decree appointing\r\nthem respectively Court Violinist and Court Violoncellist is dated\r\nNovember 19, 1790.\r\n\r\nAnton Reicha, a fatherless nephew of the concertmaster, born at Prague,\r\nFebruary 27, 1770, was brought by his uncle to Bonn. He had been\r\nalready for some years in that uncle’s care and under his instruction\r\nhad become a good player of the flute, violin and pianoforte. In Bonn,\r\nReicha became acquainted with Beethoven, who was then organist at\r\ncourt. “We spent fourteen years together,” says Reicha, “united in a\r\nbond like that of Orestes and Pylades, and were continually side by\r\nside in our youth. After a separation of eight years we saw each other\r\nagain in Vienna, and exchanged confidences concerning our experiences.”\r\nAt the age of 17 composing orchestral and vocal music for the Electoral\r\nChapel, a year later flautist in the theatre, at nineteen both flautist\r\nand violinist in the chapel and so intimate a friend of Beethoven, who\r\nwas less than a year his junior--were Reicha’s laurels no spur to the\r\nambition of the other?\r\n\r\nThe names of several of the performers upon wind-instruments were\r\nnew names in Bonn, and the thought suggests itself that the Elector\r\nbrought with him from Vienna some members of the _Harmoniemusik_ which\r\nhad won high praise from Reichardt, and it will hereafter appear that\r\nsuch a band formed part of the musical establishment in Bonn--a fact\r\nof importance in its bearing upon the questions of the origin and date\r\nof various known works both of Beethoven and of Reicha, and of no less\r\nweight in deciding where and how these men obtained their marvellous\r\nknowledge of the powers and effects of this class of instruments.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements were all made in 1788, but not early enough to admit\r\nof the opening of the theatre until after the Christmas holidays,\r\nnamely, on the evening of January 3, 1789. The theatre had been altered\r\nand improved. An incendiary fire threatened its destruction the day\r\nbefore, but did not postpone the opening. The opening piece was\r\n“Der Baum der Diana” by Vincenzo Martin. It may be thought not very\r\ncomplimentary to the taste of Maximilian that the first season of his\r\nNational Theatre was opened thus, instead of with one of Gluck’s or\r\nMozart’s masterpieces. It suffices to say that he, in his capacity of\r\nGrand Master of the Teutonic Order, had spent a good part of the autumn\r\nat Mergentheim and only reached Bonn on his return on the last day of\r\nJanuary. Hence he was not responsible for that selection.\r\n\r\nThe season which opened on January 3, 1789, closed on May 23. Within\r\nthis period the following operas were performed, Beethoven taking\r\npart in the performances as a member of the orchestra: “Der Baum der\r\nDiana” (_L’Arbore di Diana_), Martin; “Romeo und Julie,” Georg Benda;\r\n“Ariadne” (duo-drama by Georg Benda); “Das Mädchen von Frascati” (_La\r\nFrascatana_), Paisiello; “Julie,” Desaides; “Die drei Pächter” (_Les\r\ntrois Fermiers_), Desaides; “Die Entführung aus dem Serail,” Mozart;\r\n“Nina,” Dalayrac; “Trofonio’s Zauberhöhle” (_La grotta di Trofonio_),\r\nSalieri; “Der eifersüchtige Liebhaber” (_L’Amant jaloux_), Grétry; “Der\r\nSchmaus” (_Il Convivo_), Cimarosa; “Der Alchymist,” Schuster; “Das\r\nBlendwerk” (_La fausse Magie_), Grétry.\r\n\r\nThe second season began October 13, 1789, and continued until February\r\n23, 1790. On the 24th of February news reached Bonn of the death of\r\nMaximilian’s brother, the Emperor Joseph II, and the theatre was\r\nclosed. The repertory for the season comprised “Don Giovanni,” Mozart\r\n(which was given three times); “Die Colonie” (_L’Isola d’Amore_),\r\nSacchini; “Der Barbier von Sevilla” (_Il Barbiere di Siviglia_),\r\nPaisiello; “Romeo und Julie,” Georg Benda; “Die Hochzeit des Figaro”\r\n(_Le Nozze di Figaro_), Mozart (given four times); “Nina,” Dalayrac;\r\n“Die schöne Schusterin,” Umlauf; “Ariadne,” Georg Benda; “Die Pilgrimme\r\nvon Mecca,” Gluck; “Der König von Venedig” (_Il Re Teodoro_),\r\nPaisiello; “Der Alchymist,” Schuster; “Das listige Bauernmädchen”\r\n(_La finta Giardiniera_), Paisiello; “Der Doktor und Apotheker,”\r\nDittersdorf. A letter to the “Berliner Annalen des Theaters” mentions\r\nthree operas which are not in the list of the theatrical calendar\r\nand indicates that the theatre was opened soon after receipt of the\r\nintelligence of the death of Joseph, and several pieces performed,\r\namong them _Il Marchese Tulipano_ by Paisiello. The writer also\r\nmentions performances of Anfossi’s (or Sarti’s) _Avaro inamorato_,\r\nPergolese’s _Serva padrona_ and _La Villanella di spirito_, composer\r\nunmentioned, by an Italian company headed by Madame Bianchi.\r\n\r\nThe third season began October 23, 1790, and closed on March 8, 1791.\r\nBetween the opening and November 27, performances of the following\r\nmusical-dramatic works are recorded: “König Theodor in Venedig” (_Il\r\nRe Teodoro_), Paisiello; “Die Wilden” (_Azemia_), Dalayrac; “Der\r\nAlchymist,” Schuster; “Kein Dienst bleibt unbelohnt,” (?); “Der Barbier\r\nvon Sevilla,” Paisiello; “Die schöne Schusterin,” Umlauf; “Lilla,”\r\nMartini; “Die Geitzigen in der Falle,” Schuster; “Nina,” Dalayrac;\r\n“Dr. Murner,” Schuster. On March 8, the season closed with a ballet by\r\nHorschelt, “Pyramus und Thisbe.” The reporter in the “Theaterkalender”\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     On Quinquagesima Sunday (March 6) the local nobility performed\r\n     in the Ridotto Room a characteristic ballet in old German\r\n     costume. The author, His Excellency Count Waldstein, to whom the\r\n     composition and music do honor, had shown in it consideration for\r\n     the chief proclivities of our ancestors for war, the chase, love\r\n     and drinking. On March 8, all the nobility attended the theatre in\r\n     their old German dress and the parade made a great, splendid and\r\n     respectable picture. It was also noticeable that the ladies would\r\n     lose none of their charms, were they to return to the costumes of\r\n     antiquity.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding with this history a correction must be made in this\r\nreport: the music to the “Ritterballet,” which was the characteristic\r\nballet referred to, was not composed by Count Waldstein but by\r\nLudwig van Beethoven. We shall recur to it presently. Owing to a\r\nlong-continued absence of the Elector, the principal singers and the\r\ngreater part of the orchestra, the fourth season did not begin till\r\nthe 28th of December, 1791. Between that date and February 20, 1792,\r\nthe following musical works were performed: “Doktor und Apotheker,”\r\nDittersdorf; “Robert und Caliste,” Guglielmi; “Félix,” Monsigny; “Die\r\nDorfdeputirten,” Schubauer; “Im Trüben ist gut Fischen” (_Fra due\r\nLitiganti, il Terzo gode_), Sarti; “Das rothe Käppchen,” Dittersdorf;\r\n“Lilla,” Martini; “Der Barbier von Sevilla,” Paisiello; “Ende gut,\r\nAlles gut,” music by the Electoral Captain d’Antoin; “Die Entführung\r\naus dem Serail,” Mozart; “Die beiden Savoyarden” (_Les deux petits\r\nSavoyards_), Dalayrac.\r\n\r\nOPERAS AT BONN IN 1792\r\n\r\nThe fifth season began in October, 1792. Of the nine operas given\r\nbefore the departure of Maximilian and the company to Münster in\r\nDecember, “Die Müllerin” by De la Borde, “König Axur in Ormus” by\r\nSalieri, and “Hieronymus Knicker” by Dittersdorf, were the only ones\r\nnew to Bonn; and in only the first two of these could Beethoven have\r\ntaken part, unless at rehearsals; for at the beginning of November he\r\nleft Bonn--and, as it proved, forever. Probably Salieri’s masterpiece\r\nwas his last opera within the familiar walls of the Court Theatre of\r\nthe Elector of Cologne.\r\n\r\nBeethoven’s eighteenth birthday came around during the rehearsals for\r\nthe first season, of this theatre; his twenty-second just after the\r\nbeginning of the fifth. During four years (1788-1792) he was adding\r\nto his musical knowledge and experience in a direction wherein he has\r\nusually been represented as deficient--as active member of an operatic\r\norchestra; and the catalogue of works performed shows that the best\r\nschools of the day, save that of Berlin, must have been thoroughly\r\nmastered by him in all their strength and weakness. Beethoven’s\r\ntitanic power and grandeur would have marked his compositions under\r\nany circumstances; but it is very doubtful if, without the training of\r\nthose years in the Electoral “Toxal, Kammer und Theater” as member of\r\nthe orchestra, his works would have so abounded in melodies of such\r\nprofound depths of expression, of such heavenly serenity and repose and\r\nof such divine beauty as they do, and which give him rank with the two\r\ngreatest of melodists, Handel and Mozart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX\r\n\r\n     Gleanings of Musical Fact and Anecdote--Haydn in Bonn--A Rhine\r\n     Journey--Abbé Sterkel--Beethoven Extemporises--Social and\r\n     Artistic Life in Bonn--Eleonore von Breuning--The Circle of\r\n     Friends--Beethoven Leaves Bonn Forever--The Journey to Vienna.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a pendant to the preceding sketches of Bonn’s musical history a\r\nvariety of notices belonging to the last three years of Beethoven’s\r\nlife in his native place are here brought together in chronological\r\norder. Most of them relate to him personally, and some of them, through\r\nerrors of date, have been looked upon hitherto as adding proofs of the\r\nprecocity of his genius.\r\n\r\nProf. Dr. Wurzer communicated to the “Kölnische Zeitung” of August 30,\r\n1838, the following pleasant anecdote:\r\n\r\n     In the summer of the year 1790 or 1791 I was one day on business\r\n     in Godesberger Brunnen. After dinner Beethoven and another young\r\n     man came up. I related to him that the church at Marienforst (a\r\n     cloister in the woods behind Godesberg) had been repaired and\r\n     renovated, and that this was also true of the organ, which was\r\n     either wholly new or at least greatly improved. The company begged\r\n     him to give them the pleasure of letting them hear him play on\r\n     the instrument. His great good nature led him to grant our wish.\r\n     The church was locked, but the prior was very obliging and had it\r\n     unlocked for us. B. now began to play variations on themes given\r\n     him by the party in a manner that moved us profoundly; but what\r\n     was much more significant, poor laboring folk who were cleaning\r\n     out the débris left by the work of repair, were so greatly\r\n     affected by the music that they put down their implements and\r\n     listened with obvious pleasure. _Sit ei terra levis!_\r\n\r\nJOSEPH HAYDN’S VISIT TO BONN\r\n\r\nThe greatest musical event of the year (1790) in Bonn occurred just at\r\nits close--the visit of Joseph Haydn, on his way to London with Johann\r\nPeter Salomon, whose name so often occurs in the preliminary chapters\r\nof this work. Of this visit, Dies has recorded Haydn’s own account:\r\n\r\n     In the capital, Bonn, he was surprised in more ways than one. He\r\n     reached the city on Saturday [Christmas, December 25] and set\r\n     apart the next day for rest. On Sunday, Salomon accompanied\r\n     Haydn to the court chapel to listen to mass. Scarcely had the two\r\n     entered the church and found suitable seats when high mass began.\r\n     The first chords announced a product of Haydn’s muse. Our Haydn\r\n     looked upon it as an accidental occurrence which had happened only\r\n     to flatter him; nevertheless it was decidedly agreeable to him\r\n     to listen to his own composition. Toward the close of the mass a\r\n     person approached and asked him to repair to the oratory, where\r\n     he was expected. Haydn obeyed and was not a little surprised when\r\n     he found that the Elector, Maximilian, had had him summoned, took\r\n     him at once by the hand and presented him to the virtuosi with the\r\n     words: “Here I make you acquainted with the Haydn whom you all\r\n     revere so highly.” The Elector gave both parties time to become\r\n     acquainted with each other, and, to give Haydn a convincing proof\r\n     of his respect, invited him to dinner. This unexpected invitation\r\n     put Haydn into an embarrassing position, for he and Salomon had\r\n     ordered a modest little dinner in their lodgings, and it was too\r\n     late to make a change. Haydn was therefore fain to take refuge\r\n     in excuses which the Elector accepted as genuine and sufficient.\r\n     Haydn took his leave and returned to his lodgings, where he was\r\n     made aware in a special manner of the good will of the Elector, at\r\n     whose secret command the little dinner had been metamorphosed into\r\n     a banquet for twelve persons to which the most capable musicians\r\n     had been invited.\r\n\r\nWas the young musician one of these “most capable musicians”? Sunday\r\nevening, March 6th, came the performance of Beethoven’s music to the\r\n“Ritterballet” before noticed; but without his name being known.\r\nBossler’s “Musikalische Correspondenz” of July 13, 1791, contains\r\na list of the “Cabinet, Chapel and Court Musicians of the Elector\r\nof Cologne.” Names designated by an asterisk were “solo players\r\nwho may justly be ranked with virtuosi”; two asterisks indicated\r\ncomposers. Four names only--those of Joseph Reicha, Perner and the\r\ntwo Rombergs--have the two stars; Beethoven has none. “Hr. Ludwig van\r\nBeethoven plays pianoforte concertos; Hr. Neefe plays accompaniments\r\nat court and in the theatre and at concerts.... Concertante violas are\r\nplayed by virtuoso violinists”--that is all, except that we learn that\r\nthe Elector is losing interest in the instrument on which Beethoven\r\nplayed in the orchestra: “His Electoral Highness of Cologne seldom\r\nplays the viola nowadays, but finds amusement at the pianoforte with\r\noperas, etc., etc.”\r\n\r\nAt Mergentheim, the capital of the Teutonic Order, a grand meeting of\r\ncommanders and knights took place in the autumn of 1791, the Grand\r\nMaster Maximilian Francis presiding, and the sessions continuing from\r\nSeptember 18 to October 20, as appears from the records at Vienna. The\r\nElector’s stay there seems to have been protracted to a period of at\r\nleast three months. During his visit there of equal length two years\r\nbefore, time probably dragged heavily, so this time ample provision\r\nwas made for theatrical and musical amusement. Among the visiting\r\ntheatrical troupes was one called the “Häusslersche Gesellschaft,”\r\nwhich played in summer at Nuremberg, in winter in Münster and\r\nEichstädt. The entrepreneur was Baron von Bailaux, the chapelmaster\r\nWeber, the elder; and among the personnel were Herr Weber, the younger,\r\nand Madame Weber. From Max Weber’s biography of his father it appears\r\nthat these Webers were the brother and sister-in-law of Carl Maria von\r\nWeber, then a child of some five years. “The troupe,” says the reporter\r\nof the “Theater-Kalender,” “performs the choicest pieces and the\r\ngrandest operas.” So the father, Franz Anton von Weber, must have found\r\nhimself at length in his own proper element, and still more so a year\r\nlater, when he himself became the manager.\r\n\r\nThis company for a time migrated to Mergentheim and resumed the title\r\nof “Kurfürstliches Hoftheater.” Beethoven soon came thither also. Did\r\nhe, when in after years he met Carl Maria von Weber, remember him as a\r\nfeeble child at Mergentheim? Had his intercourse there with Fridolin\r\nvon Weber, pupil of Joseph Haydn, any influence upon his determination\r\nsoon after to become also that great master’s pupil?\r\n\r\nAN EXPEDITION UP THE RHINE\r\n\r\nSimonetti, Maximilian’s favorite and very fine tenor concert-singer,\r\nand some twenty-five members of the electoral orchestra, with Franz\r\nRies as conductor--Reicha was too ill--including Beethoven, the two\r\nRombergs and the fine octet of wind-instruments, formed an equally\r\nample provision for the strictly musical entertainments. Actors,\r\nsingers, musicians--Simonetti and the women-singers excepted--most\r\nof them still young, all in their best years and at the age for its\r\nfull enjoyment, made the journey in two large boats up the Rhine and\r\nMain. Before leaving Bonn the company assembled and elected Lux king\r\nof the expedition, who in distributing the high offices of his court\r\nconferred upon Bernhard Romberg and Ludwig van Beethoven the dignity\r\nof, and placed them in his service as, kitchen-boys--scullions. It\r\nwas the pleasantest season of the year for such a journey, the summer\r\nheats being tempered by the coolness of the Rhine and the currents of\r\nair passing up and down the deep gorge of the river. Vegetation was at\r\nits best and brightest, and the romantic beauty of its old towns and\r\nvillages had not yet suffered either by the desolations of the wars\r\nsoon to break upon them or by the resistless and romance-destroying\r\nmarch of “modern improvement.” Coblenz and Mayence were still capitals\r\nof states, and the huge fortress Rheinfels was not yet a ruin. When\r\nRisbeck passed down the Rhine ten years before, his boat “had a mast\r\nand sail, a flat deck with a railing, comfortable cabins with windows\r\nand some furniture, and in a general way in style was built like a\r\nDutch yacht.” In boats like this, no doubt, the jolly company made the\r\nslow and, under the circumstances, perhaps, tedious journey against the\r\ncurrent of the “arrowy Rhine.” But a glorious time and a merry they\r\nhad of it. Want of speed was no misfortune to them, and in Beethoven’s\r\nmemory the little voyage lived bright and beautiful and was to him “a\r\nfruitful source of loveliest visions.”\r\n\r\nThe Bingerloch was then held to be a dangerous, as it certainly was\r\na difficult pass for boats ascending; for here the river, suddenly\r\ncontracted to half its previous width, plunged amid long lines of\r\nrugged rocks into the gorge. So, leaving the boats to their conductors,\r\nthe party ascended to the Niederwald; and there King Lux raised\r\nBeethoven to a higher dignity in his court--Wegeler does not state what\r\nit was--and confirmed his appointment by a diploma, or letters patent,\r\ndated on the heights above Rüdesheim. To this important document was\r\nattached by thread ravelled from a sail, a huge seal of pitch, pressed\r\ninto the cover of a small box, which gave to the instrument a right\r\nimposing look--like the Golden Bull at Frankfort. This diploma from the\r\nhand of his comic majesty was among the articles taken by the possessor\r\nto Vienna where Wegeler saw it, still carefully preserved, in 1796.\r\n\r\nAt Aschaffenburg on the Main was the large summer palace of the\r\nElectors of Mainz; and here dwelt Abbé Sterkel, now a man of 40\r\nyears; a musician from his infancy, one of the first pianists of all\r\nGermany and without a rival in this part of it, except perhaps Vogler\r\nof Mannheim. His style both as composer and pianist had been refined\r\nand cultivated to the utmost, both in Germany and Italy, and his\r\nplaying was in the highest degree light, graceful, pleasing--as Ries\r\ndescribed it to Wegeler, “somewhat ladylike.” Ries and Simrock took\r\nthe young Romberg and Beethoven to pay their respects to the master,\r\n“who, complying with the general request, sat himself down to play.\r\nBeethoven, who up to this time,” says Wegeler, “had not heard a great\r\nor celebrated pianoforte player, knew nothing of the finer nuances in\r\nthe handling of the instrument; his playing was rude and hard. Now he\r\nstood with attention all on a strain by the side of Sterkel”; for this\r\ngrace and delicacy, if not power of execution, which he now heard were\r\na new revelation to him. After Sterkel had finished, the young Bonn\r\nconcertplayer was invited to take his place at the instrument; but he\r\nnaturally hesitated to exhibit himself after such a display. The shrewd\r\nAbbé, however, brought him to it by a pretence of doubting his ability.\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN’S MEETING WITH STERKEL\r\n\r\nA year or two before, Chapelmaster Vincenzo Righini, a colleague of\r\nSterkel in the service of the Elector of Mayence, had published “Dodeci\r\nAriette,” one of which, “Vieni (Venni) Amore,” was a melody with\r\nfive vocal variations, to the same accompaniment. Beethoven, taking\r\nthis melody as his theme, had composed, dedicated to the Countess of\r\nHatzfeld and published twenty-four variations for the pianoforte upon\r\nit. Some of these were very difficult, and Sterkel now expressed his\r\ndoubts if their author could himself play them. His honor thus touched,\r\n“Beethoven played not only these variations so far as he could remember\r\nthem (Sterkel could not find them), but went on with a number of\r\nothers no less difficult, all to the great surprise of the listeners,\r\nperfectly, and in the ingratiating manner that had struck him in\r\nSterkel’s playing.”[43]\r\n\r\nOnce in Mergentheim the merry monarch and his jolly subjects had other\r\nthings to think of and seem to have made a noise in the world in\r\nmore senses than one. At all events Carl Ludwig Junker, Chaplain at\r\nKirchberg, the residence of Prince Hohenlohe, heard of them and then\r\nwent over to hear them. Junker was a dilettante composer and the author\r\nof some half-dozen small works upon music--musical almanacs published\r\nanonymously, and the like, all now forgotten save by collectors, as\r\nare his pianoforte concertos--but at that time he was a man of no\r\nsmall mark in the musical world of Western Germany. He came over\r\nto Mergentheim, was treated with great attention by the Elector’s\r\nmusicians, and showed his gratitude in a long letter to Bossler’s\r\n“Correspondenz” (November 23, 1791), in which superlatives somewhat\r\nabound, but which is an exquisite piece of gossip and gives the\r\nliveliest picture that exists of the “Kapelle.” We have room for only a\r\nportion of it:\r\n\r\n     Here I was also an eye-witness to the esteem and respect in which\r\n     this chapel stands with the Elector. Just as the rehearsal was to\r\n     begin Ries was sent for by the Prince, and upon his return brought\r\n     a bag of gold. “Gentlemen,” said he, “this being the Elector’s\r\n     name-day he sends you a present of a thousand thalers.” And again,\r\n     I was eye-witness of this orchestra’s surpassing excellence.\r\n     Herr Winneberger, Kapellmeister at Wallenstein, laid before it\r\n     a symphony of his own composition, which was by no means easy\r\n     of execution, especially for the wind-instruments, which had\r\n     several solos _concertante_. It went finely, however, at the first\r\n     trial, to the great surprise of the composer. An hour after the\r\n     dinner-music the concert began. It was opened with a symphony of\r\n     Mozart; then followed a recitative and air sung by Simonetti;\r\n     next, a violoncello concerto played by Herr Romberger [Bernhard\r\n     Romberg]; fourthly, a symphony by Pleyel; fifthly, an air by\r\n     Righini, sung by Simonetti; sixthly, a double concerto for violin\r\n     and violoncello played by the two Rombergs; and the closing piece\r\n     was the symphony of Winneberger, which had very many brilliant\r\n     passages. The opinion already expressed as to the performance\r\n     of this orchestra was confirmed. It was not possible to attain\r\n     a higher degree of exactness. Such perfection in the _pianos_,\r\n     _fortes_, _rinforzandos_--such a swelling and gradual increase of\r\n     tone and then such an almost imperceptible dying away, from the\r\n     most powerful to the lightest accents--all this was formerly to\r\n     be heard only in Mannheim. It would be difficult to find another\r\n     orchestra in which the violins and basses are throughout in such\r\n     excellent hands.... The members of the chapel, almost without\r\n     exception, are in their best years, glowing with health, men of\r\n     culture and fine personal appearance. They form truly a fine\r\n     sight, when one adds the splendid uniform in which the Elector has\r\n     clothed them--red, and richly trimmed with gold.\r\n\r\n     I heard also one of the greatest of pianists--the dear, good\r\n     Bethofen, some compositions by whom appeared in the Spires\r\n     “Blumenlese” in 1783, written in his eleventh year. True, he\r\n     did not perform in public, probably the instrument here was not\r\n     to his mind. It is one of Spath’s make, and at Bonn he plays\r\n     upon one by Steiner. But, what was infinitely preferable to me,\r\n     I heard him extemporize in private; yes, I was even invited to\r\n     propose a theme for him to vary. The greatness of this amiable,\r\n     light-hearted man, as a virtuoso, may in my opinion be safely\r\n     estimated from his almost inexhaustible wealth of ideas, the\r\n     altogether characteristic style of expression in his playing, and\r\n     the great execution which he displays. I know, therefore, no one\r\n     thing which he lacks, that conduces to the greatness of an artist.\r\n     I have heard Vogler upon the pianoforte--of his organ playing I\r\n     say nothing, not having heard him upon that instrument--have often\r\n     heard him, heard him by the hour together, and never failed to\r\n     wonder at his astonishing execution; but Bethofen, in addition to\r\n     the execution, has greater clearness and weight of idea, and more\r\n     expression--in short, he is more for the heart--equally great,\r\n     therefore, as an _adagio_ or _allegro_ player. Even the members of\r\n     this remarkable orchestra are, without exception, his admirers,\r\n     and all ears when he plays. Yet he is exceedingly modest and free\r\n     from all pretension. He, however, acknowledged to me, that, upon\r\n     the journeys which the Elector had enabled him to make, he had\r\n     seldom found in the playing of the most distinguished virtuosos\r\n     that excellence which he supposed he had a right to expect. His\r\n     style of treating his instrument is so different from that usually\r\n     adopted, that it impresses one with the idea, that by a path\r\n     of his own discovery he has attained that height of excellence\r\n     whereon he now stands.\r\n\r\n     Had I acceded to the pressing entreaties of my friend Bethofen, to\r\n     which Herr Winterberger added his own, and remained another day\r\n     in Mergentheim, I have no doubt he would have played to me hours;\r\n     and the day, thus spent in the society of these two great artists,\r\n     would have been transformed into a day of the highest bliss.\r\n\r\nThere is one passage in this exceedingly valuable and interesting\r\nletter which, in the present state of knowledge of Beethoven’s youth,\r\nis utterly inexplicable. It is this: “Yet he is exceedingly modest and\r\nfree from all pretension. He, however, acknowledged to me that upon the\r\njourneys which the Elector had enabled him to make, he had seldom found\r\nin the playing of the most distinguished virtuosos that excellence\r\nwhich he supposed he had a right to expect.” What were the journeys?\r\nWho can tell?\r\n\r\nThere is but one more to add to these musical reminiscences of that\r\nperiod--another visit of Joseph Haydn, who, having changed the plan\r\nof his route, returned in July _via_ Bonn from London to Vienna.\r\nThe electoral orchestra gave him a breakfast at Godesberg and there\r\nBeethoven laid before him a cantata “which received the particular\r\nattention of Haydn, who encouraged its author to continue study.” It is\r\nnot improbable that the arrangements were in part now made under which\r\nthe young composer became a few months later the pupil of the veteran.\r\n\r\nMany a eulogy has been written upon Max Franz for his supposed\r\nprotection of, and favors granted to, the young Beethoven. It has,\r\nhowever, already been made clear that except the gracious reprimand at\r\nthe time when the singer Heller was made the subject of the boy’s joke,\r\nall the facts and anecdotes upon which those eulogies are based belong\r\nto a much later than the supposed period. The appointment of Beethoven\r\nas Chamber Musician (1789) was no distinguishing mark of favor. Half a\r\ndozen other youths of his age shared it with him. His being made Court\r\nPianist was a matter of course; for whom had he as a rival? Had he been\r\nin any great degree a favorite of the Elector, what need had there been\r\nof his receiving from Waldstein, as Wegeler states, “much pecuniary\r\nassistance bestowed in such a way as to spare his sensibilities, it\r\nbeing generally looked upon as a small gratuity from the Elector?” One\r\ngeneral remark may be made here which has a bearing upon this point,\r\nnamely: that Beethoven’s dedications of important works throughout his\r\nlife were, as a rule, made to persons from whom he had received, or\r\nfrom whom he had hopes of receiving, pecuniary benefits. Indeed, in one\r\nnotable case where such a dedication produced him nothing, he never\r\nforgot nor forgave the omission. Had he felt that Maximilian was in any\r\nsingle instance really generous toward him, why did he never dedicate\r\nany work to him? Why in all the correspondence, private memoranda and\r\nrecorded conversations, which have been examined for this work, has\r\nBeethoven never mentioned him either in terms of gratitude, or in\r\nany manner whatever? All idea that his relations to the Elector were\r\ndifferent from those of Bernhard Romberg, Franz Ries or Anton Reicha,\r\nmust be given up. He was organist, pianist, member of the orchestra;\r\nand for these services received his pay like others. There is no proof\r\nof more, no indication of less.\r\n\r\nBut with Waldstein, the case was otherwise. The young count, eight\r\nyears older than Beethoven, coming direct from Vienna, where his family\r\nconnections gave him access to the salons of the very highest rank of\r\nthe nobility, was thoroughly acquainted with the noblest and best that\r\nthe imperial capital could show in the art of music. Himself more than\r\nan ordinary dilettante, he could judge of the youth’s powers and became\r\nhis friend. We have seen that he used occasionally to go to the modest\r\nroom in the Wenzelgasse, that he even employed Beethoven to compose his\r\n“Ritterballet” music, and we shall see, that he foretold the future\r\neminence of the composer and that the name, Beethoven, would stand\r\nnext those of Mozart and Haydn on the roll of fame. Waldstein’s name,\r\ntoo, is in Beethoven’s roll of fame; it stands in the list of those to\r\nwhom important works are dedicated. The dedication of the twenty-four\r\nvariations on “Venni Amore” to the Countess Hatzfeld indicates, if\r\nit does not prove, that Beethoven’s deserts were neither unknown nor\r\nunacknowledged at her house.\r\n\r\nAt that time the favorite places of resort for the professors of\r\nthe new university and for young men whose education and position\r\nat court or in society were such as to make them welcome guests,\r\nwas the house on the Market-place now known as the Zehrgarten; and\r\nthere, says Frau Karth, Beethoven was in the habit of going. A large\r\nportion of this house was let in lodgings, and it is said that Eugène\r\nBeauharnais, with his wife and children, at one time occupied the\r\nfirst floor. Its mistress was the Widow Koch who spread also a table\r\nfor a select company of boarders. Her name, too, often appears in the\r\n“Intelligenzblatt” of Bonn in advertisements of books and music. Of her\r\nthree children, a son and two daughters, the beautiful Barbara--the\r\nBabette Koch mentioned in a letter of Beethoven’s--was the belle of\r\nBonn. Wegeler’s eulogy of her (“Notizen,” p. 58) contains the names of\r\nseveral members of that circle whom, doubtless, the young composer so\r\noften met at the house.\r\n\r\nBARBARA KOCH; ELEONORE VON BREUNING\r\n\r\n     She was a confidential friend of Eleonore von Breuning, a lady\r\n     who of all the representatives of the female sex that I met\r\n     in a rather active and long life came nearest the ideal of a\r\n     perfect woman--an opinion which is confirmed by all who had the\r\n     good fortune to know her well. She was surrounded not only by\r\n     young artists like Beethoven, the two Rombergs, Reicha, the twin\r\n     brothers Kügelchen and others, but also by the intellectual men\r\n     of all classes and ages, such as D. Crevelt, Prof. Velten, who\r\n     died early, Fischenich, who afterward became Municipal Councillor,\r\n     Prof. Thaddäus Dereser, afterward capitular of the cathedral,\r\n     Wrede, who became a bishop, Heckel and Floret, secretaries of\r\n     the Elector, Malchus, private secretary of the Austrian minister\r\n     von Keverberg, later Government Councillor of Holland, Court\r\n     Councillor von Bourscheidt, Christian von Breuning and many others.\r\n\r\nAbout the time Beethoven left Bonn for Vienna, the wife of Count\r\nAnton von Belderbusch, nephew of the deceased minister of that\r\nname, had deserted her husband for the embraces of a certain Baron\r\nvon Lichtenstein, and Babette Koch was engaged as governess and\r\ninstructress of the motherless children. In process of time Belderbusch\r\nobtained a divorce (under the French law) from his adulterous wife and\r\nmarried the governess, August 9, 1802.\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN IN THE BREUNING HOUSE\r\n\r\nBut it was in the Breuning house that Beethoven enjoyed and profited\r\nmost. The mother’s kindness towards him gave her both the right and\r\nthe power to urge and compel him to the performance of his duties; and\r\nthis power over him in his obstinate and passionate moods she possessed\r\nin a higher degree than any other person. Wegeler gives an anecdote\r\nin point: Baron Westphal von Fürstenberg, until now in the service\r\nof the Elector, was appointed minister to the Dutch and Westphalian\r\nCircuit and to the courts of Cologne and Trèves, his headquarters\r\nbeing at Bonn. He resided in the large house which is now occupied by\r\nthe post-office, directly behind the statue of him who was engaged as\r\nmusic teacher in the count’s family. The Breuning house was but a few\r\nsteps distant diagonally across a corner of the square. Here Madame\r\nvon Breuning was sometimes compelled to use her authority and force\r\nthe young man to go to his lessons. Knowing that she was watching him\r\nhe would go, _ut iniquæ mentis asellus_, but sometimes at the very\r\ndoor would turn back and excuse himself on the plea that to-day it was\r\nimpossible to give a lesson--to-morrow he would give two; to which, as\r\nupon other occasions when reasoning with him was of no avail, the good\r\nlady would shrug her shoulders with the remark: “He has his _raptus_\r\nagain,” an expression which the rapt Beethoven never forgot. Most\r\nhappy was it for him that in Madame von Breuning he had a friend who\r\nunderstood his character thoroughly, who cherished affection for him,\r\nwho could and did so effectually act as peace-maker when the harmony\r\nbetween him and her children was disturbed. Schindler is a witness that\r\njust for this phase of her motherly care Beethoven, down to the close\r\nof life, was duly grateful.\r\n\r\n     In his later days he still called the members of this family his\r\n     guardian angels of that time and remembered with pleasure the\r\n     many reprimands which he had received from the lady of the house.\r\n     “She understood,” said he, “how to keep insects off the flowers.”\r\n     By insects he meant certain friendships which had already begun\r\n     to threaten danger to the natural development of his talent and\r\n     a proper measure of artistic consciousness by awakening vanity\r\n     in him by their flatteries. He was already near to considering\r\n     himself a famous artist, and therefore more inclined to give heed\r\n     to those who encouraged him in his illusions than such as set\r\n     before him the fact that he had still to learn everything that\r\n     makes a master out of a disciple.\r\n\r\nThis is well said, is very probable in itself, and belongs in the\r\ncategory of facts as to which Schindler is a trustworthy witness.\r\n\r\nStephan von Breuning became so good a violinist as to play occasionally\r\nin the electoral orchestra. As he grew older, and the comparative\r\ndifference in age between him and Beethoven lessened, the acquaintance\r\nbetween them became one of great intimacy. Frau Karth says he was a\r\nfrequent visitor in the Wenzelgasse, and she had a lively recollection\r\nof “the noise they used to make with their music” in the room overhead.\r\nLenz, the youngest of the Breunings, was but fifteen when his teacher\r\nleft Bonn, but a few years after he became a pupil of Beethoven again\r\nin Vienna and became a good pianist. For him the composer seems to have\r\ncherished a warm affection, one to which the seven years’ difference\r\nin their ages gave a peculiar tenderness. It has been supposed that\r\nBeethoven at one time indulged a warmer feeling than mere friendship\r\nfor Eleonore von Breuning; but this idea is utterly unsupported by\r\nanything which has been discovered during the inquiries made for this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nBeethoven’s remarkable powers of improvising were often exhibited at\r\nthe Breuning house. Wegeler has an anecdote here:\r\n\r\n     Once when Beethoven was improvising at the house of the Breunings\r\n     (on which occasions he used frequently to be asked to characterize\r\n     in the music some well-known person) Father Ries was urged to\r\n     accompany him upon the violin. After some hesitation he consented,\r\n     and this may have been the first time that two artists improvised\r\n     a duo.\r\n\r\nBeethoven had in common with all men of original and creative genius\r\na strong repugnance to the drudgery of forcing the elements of his\r\nart into dull brains and awkward fingers; but that this repugnance\r\nwas “extraordinary,” as Wegeler says, does not appear. A Frau von\r\nBevervörde, one of his Bonn pupils, assured Schindler that she never\r\nhad any complaint to make of her teacher in respect to either the\r\nregularity of his lessons or his general course of instruction. Nor is\r\nthere anything now to be gathered from the traditions at Vienna which\r\njustifies the epithet. Ries’s experience is not here in point, for his\r\nrelations to Beethoven were like those of little Hummel to Mozart.\r\nHe received such instruction gratis as the master in leisure moments\r\nfelt disposed to give. There was no pretence of systematic teaching at\r\nstated hours. The occasional neglect of a lesson at Baron Westphal’s,\r\nas detailed in the anecdote above given, may be explained on other\r\nground than that of extraordinary repugnance to teaching. Beethoven\r\nwas, in 1791-’92, just at the age when the desire for distinction\r\nwas fresh and strong; he was conscious of powers still not fully\r\ndeveloped; his path was diverse from that of the other young men with\r\nwhom he associated and who, from all that can be gathered now on the\r\nsubject, had little faith in that which he had chosen. He must have\r\nfelt the necessity of other instruction, or, at all events, of better\r\nopportunities to compare his powers with those of others, to measure\r\nhimself by a higher standard, to try the effect of his compositions in\r\nanother sphere, to satisfy himself that his instincts as a composer\r\nwere true and that his deviations from the beaten track were not wild\r\nand capricious. Waldstein, we know from Wegeler (and this is confirmed\r\nby his own words), had faith in him and his works, and it will be seen\r\nthat another, Fischenich, had also. But what would be said of him and\r\nhis compositions in the city of Mozart, Haydn, Gluck? To this add the\r\nrestlessness of an ambitious youth to whom the routine of duties, which\r\nmust long since in great measure have lost the charm of novelty, had\r\nbecome tedious, and the natural longing of young men for the great\r\nworld, for a wider field of action, had grown almost insupportable.\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN’S SWEETHEARTS IN BONN\r\n\r\nOr Beethoven’s _raptus_ may just then have had a very different origin;\r\nJeannette d’Honrath, or Fräulein Westerhold, was perhaps the innocent\r\ncause--two young ladies whose names are preserved by Wegeler of the\r\nmany for whom he says his friend at various times indulged transient,\r\nbut not the less ardent, passions. The former was from Cologne, whence\r\nshe occasionally came to Bonn to pass a few weeks with Eleonore von\r\nBreuning.\r\n\r\n     “She was a beautiful, vivacious blond, of good education,” says\r\n     Wegeler, “and amiable disposition, who enjoyed music greatly and\r\n     possessed an agreeable voice; wherefore she several times teased\r\n     our friend by singing a song, familiar at the time, beginning:\r\n\r\n    ‘Mich heute noch von dir zu trennen\r\n    Und dieses nicht verhindern können,\r\n        Ist zu empfindlich für mein Herz!’\r\n\r\n     for the favored rival was the Austrian recruiting officer in\r\n     Cologne, Carl Greth, who married the young lady and died on\r\n     October 15, 1827, as Field Marshal General, Commander of the 23rd\r\n     Regiment of Infantry and Commandant at Temesvar.”[44]\r\n\r\nThe passion for Miss d’Honrath was eclipsed by a subsequent fancy\r\nfor a Fräulein von Westerhold. The Court Calendars of these years\r\nname “Hochfürstlich Münsterischer Obrist-Stallmeister, Sr. Excellenz\r\nder Hochwohlgeborne Herr Friedrich Rudolph Anton, Freyherr von\r\nWesterhold-Giesenberg, kurkölnischer und Hochstift-Münsterischer\r\nGeheimrath.” This much betitled man, according to Neefe (Spazier’s\r\n“Berlin. Mus. Zeitung”),\r\n\r\n     played the bassoon himself and maintained a fair band among his\r\n     servants, particularly players of wind-instruments. He had two\r\n     sons, one of whom was a master of the flute, and two daughters.\r\n     The elder daughter--the younger was still a child--Maria Anna\r\n     Wilhelmine, was born on July 24, 1774, married Baron Friedrich\r\n     Clemens von Elverfeldt, called von Beverföde-Werries, on April 24,\r\n     1792, and died on November 3, 1852. She was an excellent pianist.\r\n     In Münster, Neefe heard “the fiery Mad. von Elverfeldt play a\r\n     difficult sonata by Sardi (not Sarti) with a rapidity and accuracy\r\n     that were marvellous.”\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that Beethoven’s talent should have met with\r\nrecognition and appreciation in this musical family. He became the\r\nyoung woman’s teacher, and as the chief equerry Count Westerhold had\r\nto accompany the Elector on his visits to Münster, where, moreover, he\r\nowned a house, there is a tradition in the family that young Beethoven\r\nwent with them before the young lady’s marriage in 1790. She it was\r\nwith whom Beethoven was now in love. He had the disease violently, nor\r\ndid he “let concealment, like a worm i’ th’ bud,” feed upon his cheek.\r\nForty years afterward Bernhard Romberg had anecdotes to relate of this\r\n“Werther love.”\r\n\r\nThe strong doubt that any such feeling for Eleonore von Breuning was\r\never cherished by Beethoven has already been expressed. The letters to\r\nher from Vienna printed by Wegeler, and other correspondence still in\r\nmanuscript, confirm this doubt by their general tone; but that a really\r\nwarm friendship existed between them and continued down to the close\r\nof his life, with a single interruption just before he left Bonn, of\r\nthe cause of which nothing is known, so much is certain. Among the few\r\nsouvenirs of youthful friendship which he preserved was the following\r\ncompliment to him on his twentieth birthday, surrounded by a wreath of\r\nflowers:\r\n\r\n\r\nZU B’S GEBURTSTAG VON SEINER SCHÜLERIN.\r\n\r\n    Glück und langes Leben\r\n      Wünsch ich heute dir;\r\n    Aber auch daneben\r\n      Wünsch ich etwas mir!\r\n\r\n    Mir in Rücksicht deiner\r\n      Wünsch ich deine Huld,\r\n    Dir in Rücksicht meiner\r\n      Nachsicht und Geduld.\r\n\r\n    1790\r\n\r\n    Von Ihrer Freundin u. Schülerin\r\n    Lorchen von Breuning.[45]\r\n\r\nAnother was a silhouette of Fräulein von Breuning. Referring to\r\nBeethoven’s allusion to this in a letter to Wegeler (1825) the latter\r\nsays: “In two evenings the silhouettes of all the members of the von\r\nBreuning family and more intimate friends of the house, were made by\r\nthe painter Neesen of Bonn. In this way I came into the possession of\r\nthat of Beethoven which is here printed. Beethoven was probably in his\r\nsixteenth year at the time”;--far more probably in his nineteenth, the\r\nreader will say.\r\n\r\nTo the point of Beethoven’s susceptibility to the tender passion let\r\nWegeler again be cited:\r\n\r\n     The truth as I learned to know it, and also my brother-in-law\r\n     Stephan von Breuning, Ferdinand Ries, and Bernhard Romberg, is\r\n     that there was never a time when Beethoven was not in love,\r\n     and that in the highest degree. These passions, for the Misses\r\n     d’Honrath and Westerhold, fell in his transition period from youth\r\n     to manhood, and left impressions as little deep as were those\r\n     made upon the beauties who had caused them. In Vienna, at all\r\n     events so long as I lived there, Beethoven was always in love and\r\n     occasionally made a conquest which would have been very difficult\r\n     if not impossible for many an Adonis.\r\n\r\nA review of some of the last pages shows that for the most part after\r\n1789 the life of Beethoven was a busy one, but that the frequent\r\nabsences of the Elector, as recorded in the newspapers of the day, left\r\nmany a period of considerable duration during which, except for the\r\nmeetings of the orchestra for rehearsal and study, he had full command\r\nof his time. Thus he had plenty of leisure hours and weeks to devote\r\nto composition, to instruction in music, for social intercourse, for\r\nvisits to Kerpen and other neighboring places, for the indulgence of\r\nhis strong propensity to ramble in the fields and among the mountains,\r\nfor the cultivation in that beautiful Rhine region of his warm passion\r\nfor nature.\r\n\r\nThe new relations to his father and brothers, as virtual head of the\r\nfamily, were such as to relieve his mind from anxiety on their account.\r\nHis position in society, too, had become one of which he might justly\r\nbe proud, owing, as it was, to no adventitious circumstances, but\r\nsimply to his genius and high personal character. Of illness in those\r\nyears we hear nothing, except Wegeler’s remark (“Notizen,” 11): “When\r\nthe famous organist Abbé Vogler played in Bonn (1790 or 1791) I sat\r\nbeside Beethoven’s sickbed”; a mere passing attack, or Wegeler would\r\nhave vouchsafed it a more extended notice in his subsequent remarks\r\nupon his friend’s health. Thus these were evidently happy years, in\r\nspite of certain characteristic and gloomy expressions of Beethoven\r\nin letters hereafter to be given, and years of active intellectual,\r\nartistic and moral development.\r\n\r\nTHE SUGGESTION OF HAYDN AS TEACHER\r\n\r\nThe probability that in July, 1792, it had been proposed to Haydn to\r\ntake Beethoven as a pupil has been mentioned; but it is pretty certain\r\nthat the suggestion did not come from the Elector, who, there is little\r\ndoubt, was in Frankfort at the coronation of his nephew Emperor Franz\r\n(July 14) at the time of Haydn’s visit. The indefatigable Karajan[46]\r\nis unable to determine precisely when the composer left London or\r\nreached Vienna; but it is known he was in the former city after July\r\n1st and in the latter before August 4th. Whatever arrangements may have\r\nbeen made between the pupil and master, they were subject to the will\r\nof the Elector, and here Waldstein may well have exerted himself to his\r\nprotégé’s advantage. At all events, the result was favorable and the\r\njourney determined upon. Perhaps, had Haydn found Maximilian in Bonn,\r\nhe might have taken the young man with him; as it was, some months\r\nelapsed before his pupil could follow.\r\n\r\nSome little space must be devoted to the question, whence the pecuniary\r\nresources for so expensive a journey to and sojourn in Vienna were\r\nderived. The good-hearted Neefe did not forget to record the event in\r\nvery flattering terms when he wrote next year in Spazier’s “Berliner\r\nMusik-Zeitung”:\r\n\r\n     In November of last year Ludwig van Beethoven, assistant court\r\n     organist and unquestionably now one of the foremost pianoforte\r\n     players, went to Vienna _at the expense of our Elector_ to Haydn\r\n     in order to perfect himself under his direction more fully in the\r\n     art of composition.\r\n\r\nIn a note he adds:\r\n\r\n     Inasmuch as this L. v. B. according to several reports is said to\r\n     be making great progress in art and owes a part of his education\r\n     to Herr Neefe in Bonn, to whom he has expressed his gratitude\r\n     in writing, it may be well (Herr N’s modesty interposing no\r\n     objection) to append a few words here, since, moreover, they\r\n     redound to the credit of Herr B.: “I thank you for your counsel\r\n     very often given me in the course of my progress in my divine art.\r\n     If ever I become a great man, yours will be some of the credit.\r\n     This will give you the greater pleasure, since you can remain\r\n     convinced, etc.”\r\n\r\nTHE LIMIT OF MAXIMILIAN’S FAVOR\r\n\r\n“At the expense of our Elector”--so says Neefe; so, too, Fischenich\r\nsays of Beethoven “whom the Elector has sent to Haydn in Vienna.”\r\nMaximilian, then, had determined to show favor to the young musician.\r\nThis idea is confirmed by Beethoven’s noting, in the small memorandum\r\nbook previously referred to, the reception soon after reaching Vienna\r\nof 25 ducats and his disappointment that the sum had not been a\r\nhundred. (A receipt for his salary, 25 th. for the last quarter of\r\nthis year, still in the Düsseldorf archives, is dated October 22, and\r\nseems at first sight to prove an advance per favor; but many others\r\nin the same collection show that payments were usually made about the\r\nbeginning of the second month of each quarter.) There is also a paper\r\nin the Düsseldorf collection, undated, but clearly only a year or two\r\nafter Beethoven’s departure, by which important changes are made in\r\nthe salaries of the Elector’s musicians. In this list Beethoven does\r\nnot appear among those paid from the _Landrentmeisterei_ (i.e., the\r\nrevenues of the state), but is to receive from the _Chatouille_ (privy\r\npurse) 600 florins--a sum equivalent to the hundred ducats which he had\r\nexpected in vain. It is true these changes were never carried out, but\r\nthe paper shows the Elector’s intentions.\r\n\r\nWith such facts before us, how is Beethoven to be relieved of the\r\nodium of ingratitude to his benefactor? By the circumstance that, for\r\nanything that appears, the good intentions of the Elector--excepting\r\nin an increase of salary hereafter to be noted, and the transmission of\r\nthe 25 ducats--were never carried out; and the young musician, after\r\nreceiving his quarterly payment two or three times, was left entirely\r\ndependent upon his own resources. Maximilian’s justification lies in\r\nthe sea of troubles by which he was so soon to be overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nThat the 100 ducats were not advanced to Beethoven before leaving Bonn\r\nis easily accounted for. In October, 1792, the French revolutionary\r\narmies were approaching the Rhine. On the 22nd they entered Mayence;\r\non the 24th and 25th the archives and funds of the court at Bonn\r\nwere packed up and conveyed down the Rhine. On the 31st the Elector,\r\naccompanied by the Prince of Neuwied, reached Cleve on his first flight\r\nfrom his capital. It was a time of terror. All the principal towns of\r\nthe Rhine region, Trèves, Coblenz, etc., even Cologne, were deserted\r\nby the higher classes of the inhabitants. Perhaps it was owing to this\r\nthat Beethoven obtained permission to leave Bonn for Vienna just then\r\ninstead of waiting until the approaching theatrical and musical season\r\nhad passed. But with the treasury removed to Düsseldorf, he had to\r\ncontent himself with just sufficient funds to pay his way to Vienna and\r\nthe promise of more to be forwarded thither.\r\n\r\nBeethoven’s departure from Bonn called forth lively interest on the\r\npart of his friends. The plan did not contemplate a long sojourn in\r\nthe Austrian capital; it was his purpose, after completing his studies\r\nthere, to return to Bonn and thence to go forth on artistic tours.[47]\r\nThis is proved by an autograph album dating from his last days in\r\nBonn, which some of his intimate friends, obviously those with whom\r\nhe was wont to associate at the Zehrgarten, sent with him on his way,\r\nnow preserved in the Imperial Library at Vienna. The majority of the\r\nnames are familiar to us, but many which one might have expected to\r\nfind, notably those of the musicians of Bonn, are missing. Eleonore von\r\nBreuning’s contribution was a quotation from Herder:\r\n\r\n    Freundschaft, mit dem Guten,\r\n    Wächset wie der Abendschatten,\r\n    Bis des Lebens Sonne sinkt.[48]\r\n\r\n    Bonn, den 1. November      Ihre wahre Freundin Eleonore\r\n            1792                         Breuning.\r\n\r\nMost interesting of all the inscriptions in the album, however, is\r\nthat of Count Waldstein, which was first published by Schindler (Vol.\r\nI, p. 18) from a copy procured for him by Aloys Fuchs. It proves how\r\ngreat were the writer’s hopes, how strong his faith in Beethoven:\r\n\r\n     Dear Beethoven! You are going to Vienna in fulfillment of your\r\n     long-frustrated wishes. The Genius of Mozart is mourning and\r\n     weeping over the death of her pupil. She found a refuge but no\r\n     occupation with the inexhaustible Haydn; through him she wishes to\r\n     form a union with another. With the help of assiduous labor you\r\n     shall receive _Mozart’s spirit from Haydn’s hands_.\r\n\r\n    Your true friend\r\n    Waldstein.\r\n\r\n    Bonn, October 29, 1792.\r\n\r\nThe dates in the album prove that Beethoven was still in Bonn on\r\nNovember 1, 1792, and indicate that it was the last day of his sojourn\r\nthere. In Duten’s “Journal of Travels,” as translated and augmented by\r\nJohn Highmore, Gent. (London, 1782)--a Baedeker’s or Murray’s handbook\r\nof that time--the post-road from Bonn to Frankfort-on-the-Main is laid\r\ndown as passing along the Rhine _via_ Andernach to Coblenz, and thence,\r\ncrossing the river at Ehrenbreitstein, _via_ Montabaur, Limburg,\r\nWürges and Königstein;--corresponding to the route advertised in the\r\n“Intelligenzblatt” a few years later--time 25 hours, 43 minutes.\r\n\r\nTHE JOURNEY TO VIENNA\r\n\r\nThis was the route taken by Beethoven and some unknown companion.\r\nStarting from Bonn at 6 a.m. they would, according to Dutens and\r\nHighmore, dine at Coblenz about 3 p.m. and be in Frankfort about 7 next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThe first three pages of the memorandum book above cited contain a\r\nrecord of the expenses of this journey as far as Würges. One of the\r\nitems is this: “Trinkgeld (_pourboire_) at Coblenz because the fellow\r\ndrove like the devil right through the Hessian army at the risk of\r\na cudgelling, one small thaler.” This army marched from Coblenz on\r\nNovember 5; but on the same day a French corps, having advanced from\r\nMayence beyond Limburg, took possession of Weilburg. The travellers\r\ncould not, therefore, have journeyed through Limburg later than the\r\nnight of the 3rd. We conclude, then, that it was between November 1st\r\nand 3rd that Beethoven bade farewell to Bonn, and at Ehrenbreitstein\r\nsaw Father Rhine for the last time.\r\n\r\nThe temptation is too strong to be resisted to add here the contents of\r\nthe three pages of the memorandum book devoted to this journey, and the\r\nreasonings--fancies, if the reader prefers the term--drawn from them,\r\nupon which is founded the assertion that Beethoven had a travelling\r\ncompanion. This is probable in itself, and is confirmed by, first, two\r\nhandwritings; second, the price paid for post-horses (thus, the first\r\nentry is for a station and a quarter at 50 _Stüber_, the regular price\r\nbeing one florin, or 40 _Stüber_ per horse for a single passenger;\r\nthere were, therefore, two horses and 10 _Stüber_ extra per post for\r\nthe second passenger); third, the word “us” in the record of the\r\n_Trinkgeld_ at Coblenz; fourth, the accounts cease at Würges, but they\r\nwould naturally have been continued to Vienna had they been noted down\r\nby Beethoven from motives of economy; fifth, the payment of 2 fl. for\r\ndinner and supper is certainly more than a young man, not overburdened\r\nwith money, would in those days have spent at the post-house.\r\n\r\nWe may suppose, then, that the companions have reached the end of their\r\njourney in common, and sit down to compute and divide the expenses.\r\nBeethoven hands his blank-book to his friend, who writes thus:\r\n\r\n    (Page 1) From Bonn to Remagen, 1-1/4 Stat, at 50 Stbr.    3 fl.\r\n             From Remag. to Andernach, 1-1/2 St.              3.45\r\n               Tip                                              45\r\n               Tolls                                            45\r\n             From Andernach to Coblenz, 1 St.                 3.\r\n               Tips to Andernach                                50\r\n                „   to Coblenz\r\n             Tolls to Andernach                                 42\r\n             Tolls to Coblenz\r\n\r\nThese last three items are not carried out, and Beethoven now takes the\r\nbook and adds the items of the “Tolls to Andernach” thus:\r\n\r\n    Sinzig         7 St(über)      Reinicke              5     St.\r\n    Preissig      10 St.           Norich                4-1/2 St.\r\n\r\nThese 26 Stüber, changed into Kreutzers, make up the 42 in the column\r\nabove. On the next page he continues:\r\n\r\n    (Page 2) Coblenz, tolls                                   30 x\r\n             Rothehahnen (Red Cocks)                          24 x\r\n             Coblenz to Montebaur               2 rthlr. and 1/2 d\r\n               Tolls for Coblenz                              48 x\r\n             Tip because the fellow drove like the devil right\r\n               through the Hessian army at the risk of a\r\n               cudgelling                         one small thaler\r\n               Ate dinner                                    2 fl.\r\n             Post from Montebaur to Limburg             3 fl. 57 x\r\n             10 x road money\r\n             15 x  „     „\r\n\r\n    (Page 3)  Supper                                          2 fl.\r\n              in Limburg                                  12 Batzen\r\n                Tips                                           14 x\r\n              Grease money                                     14 x\r\n              Tip for postillion                              1 fl.\r\n\r\nThe other hand now writes:\r\n\r\n    The same money for meals and tips, besides 12 x\r\n    road money to Wirges.\r\n\r\nThe entries of the second and third pages are now changed into florin\r\ncurrency and brought together, making 22 fl. and 14 x; add the expenses\r\non the first page to this sum and we have a total of about 35 fl. from\r\nBonn to Würges for two young men travelling day and night, and no doubt\r\nas economically as was possible.\r\n\r\nThe next entries are by Beethoven’s hand in Vienna, and we are left\r\nto imagine his arrival in Frankfort and his departure thence _via_\r\nNuremberg, Regensburg, Passau and Linz in the public post-coach for\r\nVienna. Proof will be found hereafter that he was in that city on or\r\nbefore November 10th, and that Schindler (Vol. I, p. 19) therefore\r\nconfounds this journey with that of 1787, and is all wrong when he says\r\n“they travelled very slowly and the money which they had taken along\r\nwas exhausted before they had traversed half the journey.”\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[43] Wegeler’s story of the meeting between Beethoven and Sterkel is\r\nconfirmed in every detail by a letter from N. Simrock to Schindler, a\r\ncopy of which was found among the posthumous papers of Thayer.\r\n\r\n[44] In one of the Beethoven conversation books, _anno_ 1823, may\r\nbe read in Schindler’s handwriting: “Captain v. Greth’s address,\r\nCommandant in Temesvar.”\r\n\r\n[45] From the Fischoff Manuscript. The verbal play can scarcely be\r\ngiven in English rhymed couplets. The sentiment is: “Happiness and\r\nlong life I wish you to-day, but something do I crave for myself from\r\nyou--your regard, your forbearance and your patience.”\r\n\r\n[46] “J. Haydn in London,” page 53.\r\n\r\n[47] Neefe relates that on his second visit to England, Haydn had\r\ncontemplated taking Beethoven with him.\r\n\r\n[48] “Friendship, with that which is good, grows like the evening\r\nshadow till the setting of the sun of life.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X\r\n\r\n     Beethoven’s Creative Activity in Bonn--An Inquiry into the Genesis\r\n     of Many Compositions--The Cantatas on the Death of Joseph II and\r\n     the Elevation of Leopold II--Songs, the “Ritterballet,” the Octet\r\n     and Other Chamber Pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut for the outbreak of the French Revolution, Bonn seems to have been\r\ndestined to become a brilliant centre of learning and art. Owing to\r\nthe Elector’s taste and love for music, that art became--what under\r\nthe influence of Goethe poetry and drama were in Weimar--the artistic\r\nexpression and embodiment of the intellectual character of the time.\r\nIn this art, among musicians and composers, Beethoven, endowed with a\r\ngenius whose originality has rarely if ever been surpassed, “lived,\r\nmoved and had his being.” His official superiors, Lucchesi, Reicha,\r\nNeefe, were indefatigable in their labors for the church, the stage\r\nand the concert-room; his companions, Andreas Perner, Anton Reicha,\r\nthe Rombergs, were prolific in all the forms of composition from\r\nthe set of variations to even the opera and oratorios; and in the\r\nperformance of their productions, as organist, pianist and viola\r\nplayer, he, of course, assisted. The trophies of Miltiades allowed no\r\nrest to Themistocles. Did the applause bestowed upon the scenes, duos,\r\ntrios, quartets, symphonies, operas of his friends awaken no spirit of\r\nemulation in him? Was he contented to be the mere performer, leaving\r\ncomposition to others? And yet what a “beggarly account” is the list of\r\ncompositions known to belong to this period of his life![49] Calling\r\nto mind the activity of others, particularly Mozart, developed in\r\ntheir boyhood, and reflecting on the incentives which were offered\r\nto Beethoven in Bonn, one may well marvel at the small number and the\r\nsmall significance of the compositions which preceded the Trios Op. 1,\r\nwith which, at the age of 24 years, he first presented himself to the\r\nworld as a finished artist. But a change has come over the picture in\r\nthe progress of time. Not only are the beginnings of many works which\r\nhe presented to the world at a late day as the ripe products of his\r\ngenius to be traced back to the Bonn period; fate has also made known\r\nto us compositions of his youth which, for a long time, were lost\r\nin whole or in part, and which, in connection with the three great\r\npianoforte quartets of 1785, not only disclose a steady progress, but\r\nalso discover the self-developed individual artist at a much earlier\r\ndate than has heretofore been accepted. Now that we are again in\r\npossession of the cantatas and other fruits of the Bonn period, or have\r\nlearned to know them better as such, we are able to free ourselves\r\nfrom the old notion which presented Beethoven as a slowly and tardily\r\ndeveloped master.\r\n\r\nCANTATA ON THE DEATH OF JOSEPH II\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of Beethoven’s compositions in the Bonn period\r\nare unquestionably the cantatas on the death of Joseph II and the\r\nelevation of Leopold II. Beethoven did not bring them either to\r\nperformance or publication; they were dead to the world. Nottebohm\r\ncalled attention to the fact that manuscript copies of their scores\r\nwere announced in the auction catalogue of the library of Baron de\r\nBeine in April, 1813. It seems probable that Hummel purchased them at\r\nthat time; at any rate, after his death they found their way from his\r\nestate into the second-hand bookshop of List and Francke in Leipsic,\r\nwhere they were bought in 1884 by Armin Fridmann of Vienna. Dr. Eduard\r\nHanslick acquainted the world with the rediscovered treasures in a\r\nfeuilleton published in the “Neue Freie Presse” newspaper of Vienna\r\non May 13, 1884, and the funeral cantata was performed for the first\r\ntime at Vienna in November, 1884, and at Bonn on June 29, 1885.[50]\r\nBoth cantatas were then included in the Complete Works of Beethoven\r\npublished by Breitkopf and Härtel. The “Cantata on the Death of Joseph\r\nthe Second, composed by L. van Beethoven,” was written between March\r\nand June, 1790. The Emperor died on February 20th, and the news of his\r\ndeath reached Bonn on February 24th. The Lesegesellschaft at once\r\nplanned a memorial celebration, which took place on March 19th. At a\r\nmeeting held to make preparations for the function on February 28,\r\nProf. Eulogius Schneider (who delivered the memorial address) expressed\r\nthe wish that a musical feature be incorporated in the programme and\r\nsaid that a young poet had that day placed a poem in his hands which\r\nonly needed a setting from one of the excellent musicians who were\r\nmembers of the society or a composer from elsewhere. Beethoven’s\r\nmost influential friends, at the head of them Count Waldstein, were\r\nmembers of the society. Here, therefore, we have beyond doubt the story\r\nof how Beethoven’s composition originated. The minutes of the last\r\nmeeting for preparation, held on March 17, state that “for various\r\nreasons the proposed cantata cannot be performed.” Among the various\r\nreasons may have been the excessive difficulty of the parts for the\r\nwind-instruments which, according to Wegeler, frustrated a projected\r\nperformance at Mergentheim; though it is also possible that Beethoven,\r\nwho was notoriously a slow worker, was unable to complete the music in\r\nthe short time which was at his disposal. The text of the cantata was\r\nwritten by Severin Anton Averdonk, son of an employee of the electoral\r\nBureau of Accounts, and brother of the court singer Johanna Helene\r\nAverdonk, who, in her youth, was for a space a pupil of Johann van\r\nBeethoven. Beethoven set the young poet’s ode for solo voice, chorus\r\nand orchestra without trumpets and drums. Brahms, on playing through\r\nthe score, remarked: “It is Beethoven through and through. Even if\r\nthere were no name on the title-page none other than that of Beethoven\r\ncould be conjectured.” The same thing may be said of the “Cantata\r\non the Elevation of Leopold II to the Imperial Dignity, composed by\r\nL. V. Beethoven.” Leopold’s election as Roman Emperor took place on\r\nSeptember 30, 1790, his coronation on October 9, when Elector Max Franz\r\nwas present at Frankfort. This gives us a hint as to the date of the\r\ncomposition. Whether or not the Elector commissioned it cannot be said.\r\nAverdonk was again the poet. The two cantatas mark the culmination\r\nof Beethoven’s creative labors in Bonn; they show his artistic\r\nindividuality ripened and a sovereign command of all the elements which\r\nBonn was able to teach him from a technical point of view.\r\n\r\nOTHER WORKS OF THE BONN PERIOD\r\n\r\nTwo airs for bass voice with orchestral accompaniment are, to judge\r\nby the handwriting, also to be ascribed to about 1790. The first is\r\nentitled “‘Prüfung des Küssens’ (’The Test of Kissing’), V. L. V.\r\nBeethowen.” The use of the “w” instead of the “v” in the spelling of\r\nthe name points to an early period for the composition. The text of\r\nthe second bears the title, “Mit Mädeln sich vertragen,” and was taken\r\nby Beethoven from the original version of Goethe’s “Claudine von Villa\r\nBella.” Paper, handwriting and the spelling of the name of the composer\r\nindicate the same period as the first air. The two compositions\r\nremained unknown a long time, but are now to be had in the Supplement\r\nto the Complete Works published by Breitkopf and Härtel.\r\n\r\nTo these airs must be added a considerable number of songs as fruits\r\nof Beethoven’s creative labors in Bonn. The first of these, “Ich, der\r\nmit flatterndem Sinn,” was made known by publication in the Complete\r\nWorks. A sketch found among sketches for the variations on “Se vuol\r\nballare,” led Nottebohm to set down 1792 as the year of its origin. Of\r\nthe songs grouped and published as Op. 52 the second, “Feuerfarbe,”\r\nbelongs to the period of transition from Bonn to Vienna. On January 26,\r\n1793, Fischenich wrote to Charlotte von Schiller: “I am enclosing with\r\nthis a setting of the ‘Feuerfarbe’ on which I should like to have your\r\nopinion. It is by a young man of this place whose musical talents are\r\nuniversally praised and whom the Elector has sent to Haydn in Vienna.\r\nHe proposes also to compose Schiller’s ‘Freude,’ and indeed strophe\r\nby strophe. Ordinarily he does not trouble himself with such trifles\r\nas the enclosed, which he wrote at the request of a lady.” From this\r\nit is fair to conclude that the song was finished before Beethoven’s\r\ndeparture from Bonn. Later he wrote a new postlude, which is found\r\namong _motivi_ for the Octet and the Trio in C minor. Of the other\r\nsongs in Op. 52 the origin of several may be set down as falling in\r\nthe Bonn period. That of the first, “Urian’s Reise um die Welt,” we\r\nhave already seen. Whether or not these songs, which met with severe\r\ncriticism in comparison with other greater works of Beethoven, were\r\npublished without Beethoven’s knowledge, is doubtful.[51] Probability\r\nplaces the following songs in the period of transition, or just before\r\nit: “An Minna,” sketched on a page with “Feuerfarbe,” and other works\r\nwritten out in the early days of the Vienna period; a drinking-song,\r\n“to be sung at parting,” “Erhebt das Glas mit froher Hand,” to judge\r\nby the handwriting, an early work, presumably _circa_ 1787; “Elegie\r\nauf den Tod eines Pudels”; “Die Klage,” to be placed in 1790, inasmuch\r\nas the original manuscript form appears simultaneously with sketches\r\nof the funeral cantata; “Wer ist ein freier Mann?”, whose original\r\nautograph in the British Museum bears the inscription “ipse fecit\r\nL. v. Beethoven,” and must be placed not later than 1790, while a\r\nrevised form is probably a product of 1795, and to a third Wegeler\r\nappended a different text, “Was ist des Maurer’s Ziel?” published in\r\n1806; the “Punschlied” may be a trifle older; the autograph of “Man\r\nstrebt die Flamme zu verhehlen,” in the possession of the Gesellschaft\r\nder Musikfreunde, which has been placed in the year 1792, bears in\r\nBeethoven’s handwriting the words “pour Madame Weissenthurn par Louis\r\nvan Beethoven.” Madame Weissenthurn was a writer and actress, and from\r\n1789 a member of the company of the Burgtheater in Vienna, and it is\r\nmore than likely that Beethoven did not get acquainted with her till he\r\nwent to Vienna, although she was born on the Rhine.\r\n\r\nTurn we now to the instrumental works which date back to the Bonn\r\nperiod. The beginning is made with the work which, in a manner,\r\nfirst brought Beethoven into close relationship with the stage--the\r\n“Ritterballet,” produced by the nobility on Carnival Sunday, March 6,\r\n1791, and which, consequently, cannot have been composed long before,\r\nsay in 1790 or 1791. The ballet was designed by Count Waldstein in\r\nconnection with Habich, a dancing-master from Aix-la-Chapelle. Of\r\nthe contents of the piece we know nothing more than is contained in\r\nthe report from Bonn printed three chapters back, namely, that it\r\nillustrated the predilection of the ancient Germans for war, the\r\nchase, love and drinking; the music, being without words, can give\r\nus no further help. It consists of eight short numbers, designed to\r\naccompany the pantomime: 1, March; 2, German Song;[52] 3, Hunting Song;\r\n4, Romance; 5, War Song; 6, Drinking Song; 7, German Dance; 8, Coda.\r\nIt was intended that the music should be accepted as Waldstein’s and,\r\ntherefore, Beethoven never published it.\r\n\r\nIt seems as if the last year of Beethoven’s sojourn in Bonn was\r\nespecially influential in the development of his artistic character\r\nand ability. Of the works of 1792, besides trifles, there were two\r\nof larger dimensions which, if we were not better advised, would\r\nunhesitatingly be placed in the riper Vienna period. The autograph of\r\nthe Octet for wind-instruments, published after the composer’s death\r\nand designated at a later date as Op. 103, bears the inscription\r\n“Parthia in Es” (above this, “dans un Concert”), “Due Oboe, Due\r\nClarinetti, Due Corni, Due Fagotti di L. v. Beethoven.” From a sketch\r\nwhich precedes suggestions for the song “Feuerfarbe,” Nottebohm\r\nconcludes that the Octet was composed in 1792, or, at the latest\r\nin 1793. In the latter case it would be a Viennese product. It is\r\nimprobable, however, that Beethoven found either incentive or occasion\r\nsoon after reaching Vienna to write a piece of this character, and\r\nit is significant that in his later years he never returned to a\r\ncombination of eight instruments. But there was an incentive in Bonn\r\nin the form of the excellent dinner-music of the Elector described by\r\nChaplain Junker, which was performed by two oboes, two clarinets, two\r\nhorns and two bassoons. It may be set down as a fruit of 1792, his last\r\nyear in Bonn. For the same combination of instruments, Beethoven also\r\ncomposed a Rondino in E-flat, published in 1829 by Diabelli, probably\r\nfrom the posthumous manuscript. From the autograph Nottebohm argued\r\nthat it was written in Bonn, and what has been said of the origin of\r\nthe Octet applies also to the Rondino. The autograph of a little duet\r\nin G for two flutes bears the inscription: “For Friend Degenharth by L.\r\nv. Beethoven. August 23rd, 1792, midnight.”\r\n\r\nWe are lifted to a higher plane again by a work which in invention\r\nand construction surpasses the compositions already mentioned and\r\nstill to be mentioned in the present category, and discloses the fully\r\ndeveloped Beethoven as we know him--the Trio in E-flat, for violin,\r\nviola and violoncello, Op. 3. Its publication was announced by Artaria\r\nin February, 1797. According to Wegeler, Beethoven was commissioned\r\nby Count Appony in 1795 to write a quartet. He made two efforts, but\r\nproduced first a Trio (Op. 3), and then a Quintet (Op. 4). We know\r\nbetter the origin of the latter work now; but Wegeler is also mistaken\r\nabout the origin of the Trio; it was a Bonn product. Here the proof:\r\n\r\nAt the general flight from Bonn, whether the one at the end of October\r\nor that of December 15, 1793, the Elector ordered his chaplain, Abbé\r\nClemens Dobbeler, to accompany an English lady, the Honourable Mrs.\r\nBowater, to Hamburg. “While there,” says William Gardiner in his “Music\r\nand Friends,” III, 142, “he was declared an emigrant and his property\r\nwas seized. Luckily he placed some money in our (English) government\r\nfunds, and his only alternative was to proceed to England.” Dobbeler\r\naccompanied Mrs. Bowater to Leicester. She,\r\n\r\n     having lived much in Germany, had acquired a fine taste in music;\r\n     and as the Abbé was a very fine performer on the violin, music\r\n     was essential to fill up this irksome period (while Mrs. Bowater\r\n     lived in lodgings before moving into old Dolby Hall). My company\r\n     was sought with that of two of my friends to make up occasionally\r\n     an instrumental quartett.... Our music consisted of the Quartetts\r\n     of Haydn, Boccherini, and Wranizky. The Abbé, who never travelled\r\n     without his violin, had luckily put into his fiddle-case a Trio\r\n     composed by Beethoven, just before he set off, which thus, in\r\n     the year 1793, found its way to Leicester. This composition, so\r\n     different from anything I had ever heard, awakened in me a new\r\n     sense, a new delight in the science of sounds.... When I went\r\n     to town (London) I enquired for the works of this author, but\r\n     could learn nothing more than that he was considered a madman\r\n     and that his music was like himself. However, I had a friend in\r\n     Hamburg through whom, although the war was raging at the time, I\r\n     occasionally obtained some of these inestimable treasures.\r\n\r\nTHE TRIO FOR STRINGS, OP. 3\r\n\r\nWhat trio was this so praised by the enthusiastic Englishman? On the\r\nlast page but one of Gardiner’s “Italy, her Music, Arts and People” he\r\nwrites, speaking of his return down the Rhine:\r\n\r\n     Recently we arrived at Bonn, the birthplace of Beethoven. About\r\n     the year 1786, my friend the Abbé Dobler, chaplain to the Elector\r\n     of Cologne, first noticed this curly, blackheaded boy, the son\r\n     of a tenor singer in the cathedral. Through the Abbé I became\r\n     acquainted with the first production of this wonderful composer.\r\n     How great was my surprise in playing the viola part to his Trio in\r\n     E-flat, so unlike anything I had ever heard. It was a new sense\r\n     to me, an intellectual pleasure which I had never received from\r\n     sounds.\r\n\r\nAgain, in a letter to Beethoven, Gardiner says, “Your Trio in E-flat\r\n(for violin, viola and bass).” To all but the blind this narrative\r\npours a flood of light upon the whole question.[53]\r\n\r\nThere come up now for consideration the compositions in which\r\nBeethoven’s principal instrument, the pianoforte, is employed. They\r\ncarry us back a space, and to the earliest examples we add a related\r\ncomposition for violin.\r\n\r\nIt was a part of Beethoven’s official duty to play pianoforte before\r\nthe Elector, and it may therefore easily be imagined that after his\r\nfirst boyish attempt in 1784, he would continue to compose concertos\r\nand parts of concertos for the pianoforte and orchestra, and not wait\r\nuntil 1795, when he publicly performed the “entirely new” concerto\r\nin B-flat. Quite recently the world has learned of a first movement\r\nfor a pianoforte concerto in D, concerning which the first report\r\nwas made by Guido Adler in 1888, and which was performed in Vienna\r\non April 7, 1889, and then incorporated, as edited by Adler, in the\r\nsupplement to the Complete Works. It was discovered in copy, solo and\r\norchestra parts, in the possession of Joseph Bezeczny, the head of an\r\neducational institution for the blind in Prague, and the handwriting\r\nis his. Immediately after its first performance its authenticity was\r\nquestioned by Dr. Paumgartner, who called attention to its Mozartian\r\ncharacteristics, but failed to advance any reason for doubting the\r\ntestimony of so thorough a musical scholar as Adler. The latter had\r\nemphasized the resemblances to Mozart’s works, which, indeed, are\r\ntoo obvious to escape attention; but for a long time after 1785,\r\nespecially after Beethoven met Mozart personally in Vienna, the former\r\nwas completely in the latter’s thrall, and that his music should\r\noccasionally be reminiscent of his model is not at all singular. Such\r\nreminiscences are to be found in the quartets of 1785 and the trio for\r\npianoforte and wind-instruments. It is safe to assume that the movement\r\nwas written, as Adler suggests, in the period 1788-1793, perhaps before\r\nrather than after 1790, and that Beethoven attached little value to it\r\nand laid it permanently aside.\r\n\r\nA companion-piece to this movement is the fragment of a Concerto for\r\nViolin in C major, of which the autograph is in the archives of the\r\nGesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna, the handwriting of which\r\nindicates that it belongs to the early Vienna if not the Bonn period.\r\nThat it is a first transcription is indicated by the fact that there\r\nare many erasures and corrections. The fragment contains 259 measures,\r\nembracing the orchestral introduction, the first solo passage, the\r\nsecond _tutti_ and the beginning of the free fantasia for the solo\r\ninstrument; it ends with the introduction of a new transition _motif_\r\nwhich leads to the conjecture that the movement was finished and that\r\nthe missing portion has been lost.[54]\r\n\r\nA Trio in E-flat for Pianoforte, Violin and Violoncello, found among\r\nBeethoven’s posthumous papers, was published in 1836 by Dunst in\r\nFrankfort-on-the-Main. On the original publication its authenticity was\r\ncertified to by Diabelli, Czerny and Ferdinand Ries, and it was stated\r\nthat the original manuscript was in the possession of Schindler;\r\nWegeler verified the handwriting as that of Beethoven. Schindler\r\ncites Beethoven’s utterance that he had written the work at the age\r\nof 15 years and described it as one of his “highest strivings in the\r\nfree style of composition,” which was either a misunderstanding of\r\nSchindler’s or a bit of irony on the part of Beethoven. Nearer the\r\ntruth, at any rate, is a remark in Gräffer’s written catalogue of\r\nBeethoven’s works: “Composed _anno_ 1791, and originally intended for\r\nthe three trios, Op. 1, but omitted as too weak by Beethoven.” Whether\r\nor not this observation rests on an authentic source is not stated.[55]\r\n\r\nWhether or not the Pianoforte Trios, Op. 1, were composed in Bonn may\r\nbe left without discussion here, since we shall be obliged to recur\r\nto the subject later. The facts about them that have been determined\r\nbeyond controversy are, that they were published in 1795; were not\r\nready in their final shape in 1794; and were already played in the\r\npresence of Haydn in 1793.\r\n\r\nOTHER WORKS COMPOSED IN BONN\r\n\r\nThe Variations in E-flat for Pianoforte, Violin and Violoncello, which\r\nwere published in 1804 by Hofmeister in Leipsic as Op. 44, apparently\r\nbelong to the last year of Beethoven’s life in Bonn. Nottebohm found\r\na sketch of the work alongside one of the song “Feuerfarbe,” which\r\nfact points to the year 1792; Beethoven in a letter to the publisher\r\nappears not to have laid particular store by it, a circumstance easily\r\nunderstood in view of the great works which had followed the youthful\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nBesides these compositions, a Trio for Pianoforte, Flute and\r\nBassoon,[56] concerning which all the information which we have\r\ncame from the catalogue of Beethoven’s effects sold at auction, has\r\nrecently been published. It is No. 179 in the catalogue, where it\r\nis described as a composition of the Bonn period. On the autograph,\r\npreserved in Berlin, the title, placed at the end, is “Trio concertante\r\na clavicembalo, flauto, fagotto, composto da Ludovico van Beethoven\r\norganista di S. S. (illegible word), cologne.” The designation of the\r\ncomposer as organist, etc., fixes the place of its origin, and the\r\nhandwriting indicates an early date.\r\n\r\nAmong the papers found in Beethoven’s apartments after his death, was\r\nthe manuscript of a Sonata in B-flat for Pianoforte and Flute, which\r\npassed into the hands of Artaria. It is not in Beethoven’s handwriting,\r\nand the little evidence of its authenticity is not convincing.[57]\r\n\r\nIt is more than likely that the Variations for Pianoforte and Violin on\r\nMozart’s “Se vuol ballare” ought to be assigned to the latter part of\r\nthe Bonn period. They were published in July, 1793, with a dedication\r\nto Eleonore von Breuning, to whom Beethoven sent the composition\r\nwith a letter dated November 2, 1793.[58] The dedication leads to\r\nthe presumption that the work was carried to Vienna in a finished\r\nstate and there subjected to only the final polish. The postscript\r\nto the letter to Fräulein von Breuning betrays the reason for the\r\nhurried publication: Beethoven wanted to checkmate certain Viennese\r\npianists whom he had detected copying peculiarities of his playing\r\nin improvisation which he suspected they would publish as their own\r\ndevices.\r\n\r\nBesides the pieces already mentioned, Beethoven wrote the following\r\nworks for pianoforte in Bonn:\r\n\r\n1. A Prelude in F minor.[59] According to a remark on a printed copy\r\nshown to be authentic, Beethoven wrote it when he was 15 year old, that\r\nis, in 1786 or, the question of his age not being determined at the\r\ntime, 1787. The prelude is, as a matter of fact, a fruit of his studies\r\nin the art of imitation; and the initiative, probably, came from Bach’s\r\nPreludes.\r\n\r\n2. Two Preludes through the Twelve Major Keys for Pianoforte or Organ;\r\npublished by Hoffmeister in 1803 as Op. 39. Obviously exercises written\r\nfor Neefe while he was Beethoven’s teacher in composition.\r\n\r\n3. Variations on the arietta “Venni Amore,” by Righini, in D\r\nmajor--“Venni Amore,” not “Vieni”; the arietta begins: “Venni Amore nel\r\ntuo regno, ma compagno del Timor.” Righini gave his melody a number of\r\nvocal variations. Beethoven republished his in Vienna in 1801 through\r\nTraeg (Complete Works, Series 17, No. 178); composed about 1790 and\r\npublished in Mannheim in 1791. They were inscribed to Countess Hatzfeld\r\n(_née_ Countess de Girodin), who has been praised in this book as an\r\neminent pianist. The story of the encounter between Beethoven and\r\nSterkel in which these variations figure has also been told. Beethoven\r\nhad a good opinion of them; Czerny told Otto Jahn that he had brought\r\nthem with him to Vienna and used them to “introduce” himself.\r\n\r\nPIANOFORTE VARIATIONS AND A SONATA\r\n\r\nTwo books of variations are to be adjudged to the Bonn period because\r\nof their place of publication and other biographical considerations.\r\nThey are the Variations in A major on a theme from Dittersdorf’s\r\nopera “Das rothe Käppchen” (“Es war einmal ein alter Mann”) and the\r\nVariations for four hands on a theme by Count Waldstein. Both sets were\r\npublished by Simrock in Bonn, the first of Beethoven’s compositions\r\npublished in his native town. They were not published until 1794, but\r\naccording to a letter to Simrock, dated August 2, 1794, the latter\r\nhad received the first set a considerable time before, and Beethoven\r\nhad held back the corrections while the other was already printed.\r\nBeethoven’s intimate association with Waldstein in Bonn is a familiar\r\nstory, but we hear nothing of it in the early Viennese days. The\r\nvariations on a theme of his own seem likely to have been the product\r\nof a wish expressed by the Count. That Beethoven seldom wrote for four\r\nhands, and certainly not without a special reason, is an accepted\r\nfact.[60]\r\n\r\nAnother presumably Bonnian product which has come down to us only as a\r\nfragment is the Sonata in C major for Pianoforte, published in 1830\r\nby Dunst in Frankfort, with a dedication to Eleonore von Breuning. It\r\nis probably the sonata which Beethoven, according to the letter to\r\nbe given presently, had promised to his friend and which was fully\r\nsketched at the time. There would be no doubt of the fact that the\r\nsonata was written in Bonn if the presumption that the letter was\r\nwritten in Bonn were true; but even as it is, the fact that the letter\r\nsays that it had been promised “long ago” indicates a pre-Viennese\r\norigin. All that is certain is that Eleonore von Breuning received\r\nit from Beethoven in 1796. In the copy sent to the publisher eleven\r\nmeasures at the end of the _Adagio_ were lacking. These were supplied\r\nby Ferdinand Ries in the manner of Beethoven. There can scarcely be a\r\ndoubt that Beethoven finished the _Adagio_, and it can be assumed that\r\nhe also composed a last movement, which has been lost.\r\n\r\nConcerning the Rondo in C major published in Bossler’s “Blumenlese” of\r\n1783, we have already spoken.[61]\r\n\r\nIt is a striking fact to any one who has had occasion to examine\r\ncarefully the chronology of publication of Beethoven’s works, that up\r\nto nearly the close of 1802 whatever appeared under his name was worthy\r\nof that name; but that then, in the period of the second, third and\r\nfourth symphonies, of the sonatas. Op. 47, 53, 57 and of “Leonore,” to\r\nthe wonder of the critics of that time serial advertisements of the\r\n“Kunst- und Industrie-Comptoir” in Vienna announce the Trios, Op. 30\r\nand the seven Bagatelles, Op. 33; in another the “Grand Sinfonie,” Op.\r\n36, and the Variations on “God save the King”; on May 15, 1805, the\r\nWaldstein Sonata and the Romance, Op. 50; and on June 16 the songs.\r\nOp. 52, which the “Allgemeine Mus. Zeitung” describes as “commonplace,\r\npoor, weak, in part ridiculous stuff.” Ries solves the enigma when he\r\nwrites (“Notizen,” 124) that all trifles, many things which he never\r\nintended to publish because he deemed them unworthy of his name, were\r\ngiven to the world through the agency of his brother. In this manner\r\nthe world was made acquainted with songs which he had written long\r\nbefore he went to Vienna from Bonn. Even little compositions which he\r\nhad written in albums were filched and published.\r\n\r\nBut even if the widest latitude be given to the judgment in selecting\r\nfrom the publications of these years’ works belonging to the Bonn\r\nperiod, still what an exceedingly meagre list is the aggregate\r\nof Beethoven’s compositions from his twelfth to the end of his\r\ntwenty-second year! Mozart’s, according to Köchel, reach at that age\r\n293; Handel completed his twentieth year, February 23, 1705; on the\r\ntwenty-fifth his second opera “Nero” was performed. And what had he not\r\npreviously written!\r\n\r\nThis apparent lack of productiveness on the part of Beethoven has been\r\nnoticed by other writers. One has disputed the fact and is of opinion\r\nthat the composer in later years destroyed the manuscripts of his youth\r\nto prevent the possibility of injury to his fame by their posthumous\r\npublication. But this explanation is nonsense, as every one knows who\r\nhas had an opportunity to examine the autograph collections in Vienna\r\nand there to remark with what scrupulous care even his most valueless\r\nproductions were preserved by their author in all his migrations from\r\nhouse to house and from city to country throughout his Vienna life.\r\n\r\n     Beethoven attached absolutely no value to his autographs; after\r\n     they had once been engraved they generally were piled on the floor\r\n     in his living room or an anteroom among other pieces of music.\r\n     I often brought order into his music, but when Beethoven hunted\r\n     for anything, everything was sent flying in disorder. At that\r\n     time I might have carried away the autograph manuscripts of all\r\n     the pieces which had been printed, or had I asked him for them he\r\n     would unquestionably have given them to me without a thought.\r\n\r\nThese words of Ries are confirmed by the small number of autographs\r\nof printed works in the auction catalogue of Beethoven’s posthumous\r\npapers--most of them having remained in the hands of the publishers or\r\nhaving been lost, destroyed or stolen.\r\n\r\nWORKS TAKEN TO VIENNA FROM BONN\r\n\r\nAnother author has endeavored to supply the vacuum by deducing the\r\nchronology of Beethoven’s works from their form, matter or general\r\ncharacter as viewed by his eyes, referring all which seem to him below\r\nthe standard of the composer at any particular period to an earlier\r\none; and a very comical chronology he makes of it. His success\r\ncertainly has not been such as to induce any attempt of the kind\r\nhere; and yet that he is right in the general fact is the hypothesis\r\nwhich the following remarks are conceived to establish as truth.\r\nSchindler--who is often very positive on the ground that what he does\r\nnot know cannot be true--in introducing his chronological table of\r\nBeethoven’s works, published from 1796 to 1800, remarks: “It may be\r\nasserted with positiveness that none of the works catalogued below were\r\ncomposed before 1794”; upon which point the assertion is ventured that\r\nSchindler is thoroughly mistaken and that many of the works published\r\nby Beethoven during the first dozen years of his Vienna life were taken\r\nthither from Bonn. They doubtless were more or less altered, amended,\r\nimproved, corrected, but nevertheless belong as compositions to those\r\nyears when “Beethoven played pianoforte concertos, and Herr Neefe\r\naccompanied at Court in the theatre and in concerts.” While the other\r\nyoung men were trying their strength upon works for the orchestra and\r\nstage, the performance of which would necessarily give them notoriety,\r\nthe Court Pianist would naturally confine himself mostly to his own\r\ninstrument and to chamber music--to works whose production before a\r\nsmall circle in the salons of the Elector, Countess Hatzfeld and others\r\nwould excite little if any public notice. But here he struck out so\r\nnew, and at that time so strange a path that no small degree of praise\r\nis due to the sagacity of Count Waldstein, who comprehended his aims,\r\nfelt his greatness and encouraged him to trust to and be guided by his\r\nown instincts and genius.\r\n\r\nThat Beethoven also tried his powers in a wider field we know from\r\nthe two cantatas, the airs in “Die schöne Schusterin” and the\r\n“Ritterballet.” Carl Haslinger in Vienna also possessed an orchestral\r\nintroduction to the second act of an unnamed opera which may as well be\r\nreferred to the Bonn period as to any other; and it is not by any means\r\na wild suggestion that he had tried his strength in other concertos for\r\npianoforte and full orchestra than that of 1784. As to the compositions\r\nfor two, six or eight wind-instruments there was little if any danger\r\nof mistake in supposing them to have been written for the Elector’s\r\n“Harmonie-Musik.” But this is wandering from the point; to establish\r\nwhich the following remarks are in all humility submitted:\r\n\r\nCREATIVE INDUSTRY IN BONN\r\n\r\nI. If a list be drawn up of Beethoven’s compositions published between\r\n1795 and December, 1802, with the addition of other works known to have\r\nbeen composed in those years, the result will be nearly as follows\r\n(omitting single songs and other minor pieces): symphonies, 2; ballet\r\n(“Prometheus”), 1; sonatas (solo and duo), 32; romances (violin and\r\norchestra), 2; serenade, 1; duos (clarinet and bassoon), 3; sets of\r\nvariations, 15; sets of dances, 5; “Ah! perfido” and “Adelaide,” 2;\r\npianoforte concertos, 3; trios (pianoforte and other instruments), 9;\r\nquartets, 6; quintets, 3; septet, 1; pianoforte rondos, 3; marches\r\n(for four hands), 3; oratorio (“Christus”), 1; an aggregate of 92\r\ncompositions in eight years or ninety-six months. And most of them\r\nsuch compositions! That Beethoven was a remarkable man all the\r\nworld knows; but that he could produce at this rate, study operatic\r\ncomposition with Salieri, sustain, nay, increase his reputation as\r\na pianoforte virtuoso, journey to Prague, Berlin and other places,\r\ncorrect proof-sheets for his publishers, give lessons and yet find time\r\nto write long letters to friends, to sleep, to eat, drink and be merry\r\nwith companions of his own age--this is, to say the least, “a morsel\r\ndifficult of digestion.” The more so from the fact that at the very\r\ntime when he began to devote himself more exclusively to composition\r\nsuch marvellous fertility suddenly ceased. The inference is obvious.\r\n\r\nII. When Neefe, in 1798, calls Beethoven “beyond controversy one of the\r\nforemost pianoforte players,” it excites no surprise. Ten years before\r\nhe had played the most of Bach’s “Well-Tempered Clavichord” and had now\r\nlong held the offices of Second Court Organist and Concerto Player; but\r\nwhat sufficient reason could Waldstein have had for his faith that this\r\npianist, by study and perseverance, would yet be able to seize and hold\r\nthe sceptre of Mozart? And upon what grounds, too, could Fischenich, on\r\nJanuary 26, 1793, write as he did to Charlotte von Schiller from Bonn\r\n(see _ante_) and add, “I expect something perfect from him, for so far\r\nas I know him he is wholly devoted to the great and sublime.... Haydn\r\nhas written here that he would soon put him at grand operas and soon be\r\nobliged to quit composing.”\r\n\r\nNote the date of this--January 26, 1793. Haydn must have written some\r\ntime before this, when Beethoven could not have been with him more than\r\nsix or eight weeks. Did the master found his remark upon what he had\r\nseen in his pupil or upon the compositions which his pupil had placed\r\nbefore him? Wegeler has printed an undated and incomplete letter of\r\nBeethoven to Eleonore von Breuning, certainly, however, not later than\r\nthe spring of 1794, which was accompanied by a set of variations and\r\na rondo for pianoforte and violin. Do the following passages in this\r\nletter indicate anything?\r\n\r\n     I have a great deal to do or I would before this have transcribed\r\n     the sonata _which I promised you long ago_. It is a mere sketch in\r\n     my manuscript and it would be a difficult task even for the clever\r\n     and practised Paraquin to copy it. You can have the rondo copied\r\n     and return the score to me. It is the only one of my things which\r\n     is, in a manner, suitable to you.\r\n\r\nMay these words not be paraphrased thus: “As to the sonata which I\r\nplayed at your house and of which I promised you a copy--it is in my\r\nmanuscript hardly more than a sketch, so that I could not trust it to a\r\ncopyist, not even to Paraquin, and I have not had leisure to transcribe\r\nit myself.” And, finally, the closing lines of a short article in the\r\n“Jahrbuch der Tonkunst für Wien und Prag,” 1776--which notice was not\r\nwritten later than the spring of 1795, nine or ten months before the\r\npublication of the Sonatas Op. 2--are pregnantly suggestive: “We have\r\na number of beautiful sonatas by him, amongst which the last ones\r\nparticularly distinguish themselves.” These works were, therefore,\r\nwell-known in manuscript even at the time when he was busy with his\r\nstudies under Haydn and Albrechtsberger.\r\n\r\nIII. If in spite of the above it still be objected that the _opera_ 1\r\nto 15, or 20, as you please, are of a character beyond the powers of\r\nBeethoven during his Bonn life, who _knows_ this to be a fact? Has such\r\nan objection any other basis than a mere prejudice?\r\n\r\nEVIDENCES OF EARLY ACTIVITY\r\n\r\nA fanciful theory has exhibited Beethoven to us as a rude, undeveloped\r\ngenius, who, being transferred to Vienna and schooled two years by\r\nHaydn and Albrechtsberger, then began with the Trios Op. 1, wrought\r\nhis way upward in eight years through the twenty-three compositions of\r\n_opera_ 2 to 14 in a geometrical progression to the first pianoforte\r\nconcertos, the ballet “Prometheus” and the Symphony in C! It is,\r\nhowever, known that in March, 1795, Beethoven played his Pianoforte\r\nConcerto in B-flat in Vienna, shortly afterward published the Trios,\r\nOp. 1, and in 1796 composed the two sonatas for pianoforte and\r\nvioloncello in Berlin. A young man who at the age of 24 or 25 could\r\ngive the public two such concertos could hardly have been such a rough\r\ndiamond only three or four years before.\r\n\r\nIV. However convincing the preceding propositions may seem to the\r\nordinary reader, the critical student of musical history justly demands\r\nsomething more. It is not enough for him to know that Op. 19 was\r\ncomposed before the publication of Op. 1; that Op. 2 is in part made\r\nup from the Pianoforte Quartets of 1785; that the Quintet Op. 4 is an\r\narrangement of the “Parthia” in E-flat for wind-instruments afterwards\r\npublished as Op. 103, and is now proved to belong to the Bonn period,\r\nand that a whole movement of the funeral cantata found its way into\r\n“Fidelio”--the argument is to him like an arch without its keystone\r\nuntil one or more of the important works be named specifically as Bonn\r\ncompositions and proved to be such.[62]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[49] The discoveries made after Thayer completed and printed his first\r\nvolume in German (1866), largely inspired by his labors, have made\r\na thorough revision of this chapter imperative. In all that follows\r\nthe editor has accepted the statement of facts made by Dr. Deiters in\r\nhis revised version of the first volume published in 1901, but, in\r\npursuance of his plan as set forth in the introduction, has omitted\r\nthat which seemed to him more or less inconsequential, as well as that\r\nwhich belongs in the field of analysis and criticism.\r\n\r\n[50] There have been a few performances of this cantata in Austria\r\nand Germany since its publication. It was given at a concert of\r\nthe Beethoven Association in New York on March 16, 1920, under the\r\ndirection of Mr. Sam Franko, with an English paraphrase of the text\r\nby the Editor of this biography, designed to rid it of its local\r\napplication and some of its bombast and make its sentiment applicable\r\nto any heroic emancipator.\r\n\r\n[51] See Vol. II, p. 210, of the first German edition of this work.\r\nRies says, on page 124 of the “Notizen,” apropos of the posthumous\r\nmanuscripts: “All such trifles and things which he never meant to\r\npublish, as not considering them worthy of his name, were secretly\r\nbrought into the world by his brothers. Such were the songs published\r\nwhen he had attained the highest degree of fame, composed years before\r\nat Bonn, previous to his departure for Vienna; and in like manner other\r\ntrifles, written for albums, etc., were secretly taken from him and\r\npublished.”\r\n\r\n[52] The subject of the German Song was used by Beethoven later in a\r\nsonata.\r\n\r\n[53] The Trio in E-flat was not published until 1797. It is therefore\r\nobvious that the music which Abbé Dobbeler carried with him to England\r\nmust have been a manuscript copy. Dr. Deiters, accepting without\r\nattempt at contradiction Thayer’s proof of its origin at a period not\r\nlater than 1792, nevertheless puts forth the conjecture that the work\r\nmay have been revised and reconstructed at a later date in Vienna, as\r\nwas the case with other compositions. It is not to be supposed, he\r\nurges, that Beethoven, enjoying the celebrity that he did in 1797,\r\nwould have published then with an opus number a production of his youth\r\nwithout first subjecting it to a thorough revision. Moreover, his\r\nearlier chamber compositions were in three movements, the minuet having\r\nbeen added for the first time in the Octet. It was scarcely conceivable\r\nthat he should have simultaneously conceived a work in six movements\r\nunless he had had a Mozart model in his mind. But why not? We have seen\r\nfrom the story of the music admired at the court of Vienna from which\r\nthe Elector came that the serenade form was in favor there. The Sonata\r\nfor Pianoforte and Violoncello which Artaria announced in May, 1807, is\r\nan arrangement of this Trio, but it was not made by Beethoven.\r\n\r\n[54] Josef Hellmesberger, of Vienna, completed the movement, utilizing\r\nthe existing _motivi_, and the piece was published by Friedrich\r\nSchreiber.\r\n\r\n[55] Dr. Deiters points out as characteristics of this Trio which\r\nindicate that it was not written by Beethoven at the age of 15, but\r\nlong after the pianoforte quartets, the freedom in invention and\r\ndevelopment, the large dimensions of the free fantasia portion,\r\nits almost imperceptible return to the principal theme, and the\r\nintroduction of a coda in the first movement. _Motivi_ from this\r\nmovement recur in later works, for instance, the Sonata in F minor, Op.\r\n2, and the Pianoforte Concerto in C major. Beethoven seems to have used\r\nthe designation “Scherzo” in it for the first time.\r\n\r\n[56] The combination of instruments in this piece led Dr. Deiters\r\nto conjecture that it may have been composed for the family von\r\nWesterhold. Count von Westerhold played the bassoon, his son the flute,\r\nand his daughter the pianoforte.\r\n\r\n[57] Dr. Deiters points out that Thayer, in transcribing the themes of\r\nthis Trio, overlooked a _Largo_, which made the movements number four\r\ninstead of three as given in the Chronological Catalogue. The existence\r\nof four movements added to the doubtful authenticity in the eyes of the\r\nGerman editor.\r\n\r\n[58] This letter will appear later. The Variations are published\r\nin Series 12, No. 103, of the Complete Edition. In a catalogue of\r\nBreitkopf and Härtel of 1793, they are designated Op. 1; also in a\r\ncatalogue in 1794 of Geyl and Hedler’s. It is plain from a passage in\r\nthe letter to Eleonore von Breuning (“I never would have written it\r\nin this way,” etc.) that the Coda did not receive its definitive form\r\nuntil just before publication. Thayer was of the opinion when he wrote\r\nVol. I of this work, that it had been appended in Vienna.\r\n\r\n[59] It was published in 1805 by the Kunst- und Industriecomptoir\r\nof Vienna. Complete Works, Series 18, No. 195; _cf._ Nottebohm’s\r\n“Beethoven’s Studien,” p. 6.\r\n\r\n[60] In the Fall of 1919, announcement was made by the newspapers\r\nthat French investigators had discovered in the British Museum four\r\nthitherto unknown Beethoven autographs amongst manuscripts purchased by\r\nJulian Marshall. The editor of the second edition of Köchel’s “Thematic\r\nCatalogue of Mozart’s Works” had seen the manuscripts and included two\r\nof them as authentic Mozart compositions and two as probably such in\r\nthe supplement to that work. They were a Trio in D, for pianoforte,\r\nviolin and violoncello (two pages of the first _Allegro_ missing,\r\nlisted as K, No. 52a); three pieces for pianoforte, four hands, a\r\n_Gavotte_ in F, an _Allegro_ in B-flat, and a _Marcia lugubre_ in\r\nC minor (six measures), No. 71a; a _Rondo_ in B-flat, to which the\r\neditor assigned the year 1786, No. 511a; and a _Menuet_ in C, for\r\norchestra, the first of a set composed by Beethoven in 1795, which M.\r\nChantavoine published in 1903 under the title “Douze Menuets inédits\r\npour Orchestre. L. van Beethoven. Œuvres posthumes. Au Ménestrel.”\r\nTheodore Wyzewa and Georges de St. Foix made a study of the manuscripts\r\nand discussed them in “Le Guide Musical” of December, 1919, January\r\nand February, 1920. They were then set down as “pseudo-Mozarts.” M.\r\nCharles Malherbe declared that none of the compositions was in Mozart’s\r\nhand, and M. de St. Foix, after further consideration of the internal\r\nevidence, declared them all to be indubitably by Beethoven and gave\r\nhis reasons in an essay published in “The Musical Quarterly” (New York\r\nand Boston, G. Schirmer) of April, 1920. He told the history of the\r\nmanuscripts as follows: “They had been presented by the Emperor of\r\nAustria to the Sultan Abdul Aziz. The latter, who probably cared very\r\nlittle for these relics of the 18th century, presented them in turn\r\nto his musical director, Guatelli Pasha. An English collector, Julian\r\nMarshall, purchased them from the Pasha’s son, W. Guatelli Bey, and\r\nwhen, later on, the British Museum acquired the Marshall Collection\r\nthese manuscripts went over into its possession.”\r\n\r\nThe _Gavotte_ was played at a concert of the Beethoven Association in\r\nNew York in January, 1920, by Madame Samaroff and Harold Bauer, being\r\ninserted as a movement in the Sonata in A major for four hands, Op.\r\n6. Mr. Bauer also made an arrangement for two hands which has been\r\npublished by G. Schirmer.\r\n\r\n[61] The discoveries which have been made since Thayer wrote his first\r\nvolume have very effectually disproved the old belief touching the\r\nsterility of the Bonn period. The inquiry which might still be pursued\r\nnow is whether or not other compositions which have been attributed to\r\na later period may not also have been composed, or at least projected\r\nand sketched, in Bonn. The point of view has changed, but what Thayer\r\nwrote over half a century ago is still so largely pertinent that it is\r\nhere given in the body of the text with only such modifications as were\r\nnecessary to bring it into harmony with the rest of the chapter.\r\n\r\n[62] Thayer proceeds from this point to give the reasons for his belief\r\nthat the Trios Op. 1 and 3 were written in Bonn. The origin of Op. 1\r\nwill be discussed hereafter; that of the latter has just been made\r\nclear by the story of Mrs. Bowater and Abbé Dobbeler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI\r\n\r\n     Beethoven in Vienna--Personal Details--Death of His Father--Minor\r\n     Expenditures and Receipts--Studies with Albrechtsberger and\r\n     Salieri.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN SETTLES DOWN IN VIENNA\r\n\r\nIt would be pleasant to announce the arrival of Ludwig van Beethoven in\r\nVienna with, so to speak, a grand flourish of trumpets, and to indulge\r\nthe fancy in a highly-colored and poetic account of his advent there;\r\nbut, unluckily, there is none of that lack of data which is favorable\r\nto that kind of composition; none of that obscurity which exalts one to\r\nwrite history as he would have it and not as it really was. The facts\r\nare too patent. Like the multitude of studious youths and young men who\r\ncame thither annually to find schools and teachers, this small, thin,\r\ndark-complexioned, pockmarked, dark-eyed, bewigged young musician of\r\n22 years had quietly journeyed to the capital to pursue the study of\r\nhis art with a small, thin, dark-complexioned, pockmarked, black-eyed\r\nand bewigged veteran composer. In the well-known anecdote related by\r\nCarpani of Haydn’s introduction to him, Anton Esterhazy, the prince, is\r\nmade to call the composer “a Moor.” Beethoven had even more of the Moor\r\nin his looks than his master. His front teeth, owing to the singular\r\nflatness of the roof of his mouth, protruded, and, of course, thrust\r\nout his lips; the nose, too, was rather broad and decidedly flattened,\r\nwhile the forehead was remarkably full and round--in the words of\r\nthe late Court Secretary, Mähler, who twice painted his portrait, a\r\n“bullet.”\r\n\r\n“Beethoven,” wrote Junker, “confessed that in his journeys he had\r\nseldom found in the playing of the most distinguished virtuosos that\r\nexcellence which he supposed he had a right to expect.” He now had an\r\nopportunity to make his observations upon the pianists and composers\r\nat the very headquarters, then, of German music, to improve himself by\r\nstudy under the best of them and, by and by, to measure his strength\r\nwith theirs. He found very soon that the words of the poet were here\r\nalso applicable:\r\n\r\n“’Tis distance lends enchantment to the view,” and did not find--now\r\nMozart was gone--“what he supposed he had a right to expect.” For the\r\npresent, however, we have to do but with the young stranger in a large\r\ncity, seeking lodgings, and making such arrangements for the future as\r\nshall not be out of due proportion to the limited pecuniary means at\r\nhis command. If the minute details which here follow should seem to be\r\ntoo insignificant in themselves, the bearing they have upon some other\r\nfuture questions must justify their introduction.\r\n\r\nTurning again to the memorandum book, the first entries which follow\r\nthe notes of the journey from Bonn to Würges are merely of necessities\r\nto be supplied--“wood, wig-maker, coffee, overcoat, boots, shoes,\r\npianoforte-desk, seal, writing-desk, pianoforte-money” and something\r\nillegible followed by the remark: “All beginning with next month.” The\r\nnext page gives a hint as to the day of his arrival. It contains the\r\nsubstance of two advertisements in the “Wiener Zeitung” of pianofortes\r\nfor sale, one near the Hohen Markt and two “im Kramerschen Breihaus No.\r\n257 im Schlossergassel, am Graben.” The latter appears _for the last\r\ntime_ on the 10th of November; Beethoven was, therefore, then in Vienna.\r\n\r\nBut he intends to cultivate the Graces as well as the Muses. The next\r\npage begins with this: “Andreas Lindner, dancing-master, lives in the\r\nStoss am Himmel, No. 415,” to which succeeds a note, evidently of money\r\nreceived from the Elector, possibly in Bonn but more likely in Vienna:\r\n“25 ducats received of which, expended on November (?) half a sovereign\r\nfor the pianoforte, or 6 florins, 40 kreutzer--2 florins were of my\r\nown money.” The same page also shows him in the matter of his toilet\r\npreparing even then for entrance into society: “Black silk stockings,\r\n1 ducat; 1 pair of winter silk stockings, 1 florin, 40 kreutzers;\r\nboots, 6 florins; shoes, 1 florin, 30 kreutzers.” But these expenses in\r\naddition to his daily necessities are making a large inroad upon his\r\n“25 ducats received”; and on page 7 we read: “On Wednesday the 12th of\r\nDecember, I had 15 ducats.” (The 12th of December fell upon Wednesday\r\nin the year 1792.) Omitting for the present what else stands upon page\r\n7, here are the interesting contents of page 8--and how suggestive and\r\npregnant they are: “In Bonn I counted on receiving 100 ducats here; but\r\nin vain. I have got to equip myself completely anew.”\r\n\r\nSeveral pages which follow contain what, upon inspection, proves\r\nevidently to be his monthly payments from the time when “all was to\r\nbegin next month,” of which the first may be given as a specimen:\r\n“House-rent, 14 florins; pianoforte, 6 florins, 49 kreutzers; eating,\r\neach time 12 kreutzers; meals with wine 6 and one-half florins; 3\r\nkreutzers for B. and H.; it is not necessary to give the housekeeper\r\nmore than 7 florins, the rooms are so close to the ground.”[63]\r\n\r\nDEATH OF JOHANN VAN BEETHOVEN\r\n\r\nBeethoven was hardly well settled in his lodgings, the novelty of his\r\nposition had scarcely begun to wear off under the effect of habit,\r\nwhen startling tidings reached him from Bonn of an event to cloud\r\nhis Christmas holidays, to weaken his ties to his native place, to\r\nincrease his cares for his brothers and make an important change in\r\nhis pecuniary condition. His father had suddenly died--“1792, Dec. 18,\r\n_obiit_ Johannes Beethoff,” says the death-roll of St. Remigius parish.\r\nThe Elector-Archbishop, still in Münster, heard this news also and\r\nconsecrated a joke to the dead man’s memory. On the 1st of January,\r\n1793, he wrote a letter to Court Marshal von Schall in which these\r\nwords occur:\r\n\r\n     The revenues from the liquor excise have suffered a loss in the\r\n     deaths of Beethoven and Eichhoff. For the widow of the latter,\r\n     provision will be made if circumstances allow in view of his 40\r\n     years of service--in the electoral kitchen.\r\n\r\nFranz Ries was again to befriend Beethoven and act for him in his\r\nabsence, and the receipt for his first quarter’s salary (25 th.) is\r\nsigned “F. Ries, in the name of Ludwig Beethoven,” at the usual time,\r\nnamely the beginning of the second month of the quarter, February 4.\r\nBut the lapse of Johann van Beethoven’s pension of 200 thalers, was\r\na serious misfortune to his son, particularly since the 100 ducats\r\nwere not forthcoming. The correspondence between Beethoven and Ries\r\nnot being preserved it can only be conjectured that the latter took\r\nthe proper steps to obtain that portion of the pension set apart by\r\nthe electoral decree for the support of the two younger sons; but in\r\nvain, owing to the disappearance of the original document; and that,\r\nreceiving information of this fact, Beethoven immediately sent from\r\nVienna the petition which follows, but which, as is mostly the case\r\nwith that class of papers in the Bonn archives, is without date:\r\n\r\n     Several years ago Your Serene Electoral Highness was graciously\r\n     pleased to retire my father, the tenor singer van Beethoven, from\r\n     service, and to set aside 100 thalers of his salary to me that I\r\n     might clothe, nourish and educate my two younger brothers and also\r\n     pay the debts of my father.\r\n\r\n     I was about to present this decree to Your Highness’s Revenue\r\n     Exchequer when my father urgently begged me not to do so inasmuch\r\n     as it would have the appearance in the eyes of the public as if\r\n     he were incapable of caring for his family, adding that he would\r\n     himself pay me the 25 thalers quarterly, which he always did.\r\n\r\n     When, however, on the death of my father (in December of last\r\n     year) I wished to make use of Your Highness’s grace by presenting\r\n     the above-mentioned gracious decree I learned to my terror, that\r\n     my father had misapplied (_unterschlagen_ = to embezzle) the same.\r\n\r\n     In most obedient veneration I therefore pray Your Electoral\r\n     Highness for the gracious renewal of this decree and that Your\r\n     Highness’s Revenue Exchequer be directed to pay over to me the sum\r\n     graciously allowed to me due for the last quarter at the beginning\r\n     of last February.\r\n\r\n    Your Electoral and Serene Highness’s\r\n    Most obedient and faithful\r\n    Lud. v. Beethoven; Court Organist.\r\n\r\nThe petition was duly considered by the Privy Council and with the\r\nresult indicated by the endorsement:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _ad sup._ of the Court Organist L. van Beethoven\r\n\r\n     ... “The 100 reichsthaler which he is now receiving annually is\r\n     increased by a further 100 reichsthaler in quarterly payments\r\n     beginning with January 1st, from the 200 rth. salary vacated\r\n     by the death of his father; he is further to receive the three\r\n     measures of grain graciously bestowed upon him for the education\r\n     of his brothers.” The Electoral Court Chancellory will make the\r\n     necessary provisions. Attest p.\r\n\r\nThe order to the exchequer followed on May 24th, and on June 15th,\r\nFranz Ries had the satisfaction of signing receipts--one for 25\r\nthalers for January, February and March, and one for 50 thalers for\r\nthe second quarter of the year; but from this time onward no hint has\r\nyet been discovered that Beethoven ever received anything from the\r\nElector or had any resources but his own earnings and the generosity\r\nof newly-found friends in Vienna. These resources were soon needed.\r\nThe remark that two florins of the payment towards the pianoforte were\r\nout of his own money proves that he possessed a small sum saved up by\r\ndegrees from lesson-giving, from presents received and the like; but\r\nit could not have been a large amount, while the 25 ducats and the\r\nabove recorded receipts of salary were all too small to have carried\r\nhim through the summer of 1793. Here is the second of his monthly\r\nrecords of necessary and regular expenses in farther proof of this:\r\n“14 florins house-rent; 6 fl. 40 x, pianoforte; meals with wine, 15\r\nfl. and a half;--(?), 3 florins; maid, 1,” the sum total being as\r\nadded by himself “11 ducats and one-half florin.” And yet at the end\r\nof the year there are entries that show that he was not distressed for\r\nmoney. For instance: “the 24th October, i.e., reckoning from November\r\n1st, 112 florins and 30 kreutzer”; “2 ducats for a seal; 1 florin, 25\r\nkreutzers, copyist”; “Tuesday and Saturday from 7 to 8. Sunday from 11\r\nto 12, 3 florins”; and the final entry not later in date than 1794 is:\r\n“3 carolins in gold, 4 carolins in crown thalers and 4 ducats make 7\r\ncarolins and 4 ducats and a lot of small change.”\r\n\r\nIn what manner Beethoven was already in 1794 able to remain “in Vienna\r\nwithout salary until recalled,” to quote the Elector’s words, will\r\nhereafter appear with some degree of certainty; but just now he claims\r\nattention as pupil of Haydn and Albrechtsberger. The citations made in\r\na previous chapter from the letters of Neefe and Fischenich prove how\r\nstrong an impression Beethoven’s powers, both as virtuoso and composer,\r\nhad made upon Joseph Haydn immediately after his reaching Vienna; and\r\nno man then living was better able to judge on such points. But whether\r\nthe famous chapelmaster, just returned from his English triumphs,\r\nhimself a daring and successful innovator and now very busy with\r\ncompositions in preparation for his second visit to London, was the man\r\nto guide the studies of a headstrong, self-willed and still more daring\r\nmusical revolutionist was, _a priori_, a very doubtful question. The\r\nresult proved that he was not.\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN’S STUDIES WITH HAYDN\r\n\r\nThe memorandum book has a few entries which relate to Haydn. On page 7,\r\nthat which contains the 15 ducats on the 12th of October, 1792, there\r\nis a column of numerals, the first of which reads, “Haidn 8 groschen”;\r\nthe other twelve, except a single “1,” all “2”; and on the two pages\r\nwhich happen to have the dates of October 24 and 29, 1793, are these\r\ntwo entries: “22 x, chocolate for Haidn and me”; “Coffee, 6 x for Haidn\r\nand me.” These notes simply confirm what was known from other sources,\r\nnamely, that Beethoven began to study with Haydn very soon after\r\nreaching Vienna and continued to be his pupil until the end of the year\r\n1793.[64] They indicate, also, that the scholar, whatever feelings he\r\nmay have indulged towards the master in secret, kept on good terms with\r\nhim, and that their private intercourse was not confined to the hours\r\ndevoted to lessons in Haydn’s room in the Hamberger house, No. 992 on\r\nthe (no longer existing) Wasserkunstbastei.\r\n\r\nConcerning the course of study during that year, nothing can be added\r\nto the words of Nottebohm (“Allg. Mus. Zeitung,” 1863-1864), founded\r\nupon a most thorough examination of all the known manuscripts and\r\nauthorities which bear upon this question. Of the manuscripts Nottebohm\r\nsays: “They are exercises in simple counterpoint on six plain chants\r\nin the old modes.... He must have written more.” But what? On this\r\npoint there are no indications to be found. It may be accepted with\r\nconsiderable certainty that the contrapuntal exercises were preceded\r\nby an introductory, though probably brief, study of the nature of\r\nconsonances and dissonances. For this the last chapter of the first\r\nbook of Fux’s “Gradus ad Parnassum” might have served.\r\n\r\n     But this (adds Nottebohm) would not have sufficed to fill the\r\n     entire period. In view of Haydn’s predilection for Fux’s system it\r\n     is not conceivable that there were preliminary exercises, say in\r\n     the free style or in the modern keys; there remains, therefore, no\r\n     alternative but to go back further and opine that the study with\r\n     Haydn began with the theory of harmony and exercises in which the\r\n     system of Philipp Emanuel Bach might have been used.\r\n\r\n“It is certain,” says Schindler, “that Beethoven’s knowledge of the\r\nscience of harmony at the time when he began his study with Haydn\r\ndid not go beyond thoroughbass.” The correctness of this opinion of\r\nSchindler may be safely left to the judgment of the reader. The fact\r\nseems to be that Beethoven, conscious of the disadvantages attending\r\nthe want of thorough systematic instruction, distrustful of himself\r\nand desirous of bringing to the test many of his novel and cherished\r\nideas, had determined to accomplish a complete course of contrapuntal\r\nstudy, and thus renew, revise and reduce to order and system the\r\ngreat mass of his previous scientific acquirements. He would, at all\r\nevents, thoroughly know and understand the _regular_ that he might with\r\nconfidence judge for himself how far to indulge in the _irregular_. To\r\nthis view, long since adopted, the results of Nottebohm’s researches\r\nadd credibility. It explains, also, how a young man, too confident\r\nin the soundness of his views to be willing to alter his productions\r\nbecause they contained passages and effects censured by those about him\r\nfor being other than those of Mozart and Haydn, was yet willing, with\r\nthe modesty of true genius, to shut them up in his writing-desk until,\r\nthrough study and observation, he could feel himself standing upon the\r\nfirm basis of sound knowledge and then retain or exclude, according to\r\nthe dictates of an enlightened judgment.\r\n\r\nBeethoven, however, very soon discovered that also in Haydn, as a\r\nteacher, he had “not found that excellence which he supposed he had a\r\nright to expect.” Ries remembered a remark made by him on this point:\r\n“Haydn had wished that Beethoven might put the word, ‘Pupil of Haydn,’\r\non the title of his first works. Beethoven was unwilling to do so\r\nbecause, as he said, though he had had some instruction from Haydn\r\nhe had never learned anything from him.” Still more in point is the\r\noft-repeated story of Johann Schenk’s kindness to Beethoven, related by\r\nSeyfried in Gräfer’s and Schilling’s lexica and confirmed by Schindler,\r\nwhich, when divested of its errors in dates, may be related thus:\r\nAmong Beethoven’s earliest acquaintances in Vienna was the Abbé Joseph\r\nGelinek, one of the first virtuosos then in that city and an amazingly\r\nfruitful and popular composer of variations. It was upon him that Carl\r\nMaria von Weber, some years afterwards, wrote the epigram:\r\n\r\n    Kein Thema auf der Welt verschonte dein Genie,\r\n    Das simpelste allein--Dich selbst--variirst du nie!\r\n\r\n        “No theme on earth escaped your genius airy,--\r\n        The simplest one of all--yourself--you never vary.”\r\n\r\nCzerny told Otto Jahn that his father once met Gelinek tricked out in\r\nall his finery. “Whither?” he inquired. “I am asked to measure myself\r\nwith a young pianist who is just arrived; I’ll use him up.” A few days\r\nlater he met him again. “Well, how was it?” “Ah, he is no man; he’s a\r\ndevil. He will play me and all of us to death. And how he improvises!”\r\nAccording to Czerny, Gelinek remained a sworn enemy to Beethoven.\r\n\r\nIt was in Gelinek’s lodgings that Schenk heard Beethoven improvise for\r\nthe first time,\r\n\r\n     a treat which recalled lively recollections of Mozart. With many\r\n     manifestations of displeasure, Beethoven, always eager to learn,\r\n     complained to Gelinek that he was never able to make any progress\r\n     in his contrapuntal studies under Haydn, since the master, too\r\n     variously occupied, was unable to pay the amount of attention\r\n     which he wanted to the exercises he had given him to work out.\r\n     Gelinek spoke on the subject with Schenk and asked him if he did\r\n     not feel disposed to give Beethoven a course in composition.\r\n     Schenk declared himself willing, with ready courtesy, but only\r\n     under two conditions: that it should be without compensation\r\n     of any kind and under the strict seal of secrecy. The mutual\r\n     agreement was made and kept with conscientious fidelity.\r\n\r\nThus far Seyfried; we shall now permit Schenk to tell his own story:[65]\r\n\r\n     In 1792, His Royal Highness Archduke Maximilian, Elector of\r\n     Cologne, was pleased to send his charge Louis van Beethoven to\r\n     Vienna to study musical composition with Haydn. Towards the end of\r\n     July, Abbé Gelinek informed me that he had made the acquaintance\r\n     of a young man who displayed extraordinary virtuosity on the\r\n     pianoforte, such, indeed, as he had not observed since Mozart. In\r\n     passing he said that Beethoven had been studying counterpoint with\r\n     Haydn for more than six months and was still at work on the first\r\n     exercise; also that His Excellency Baron van Swieten had earnestly\r\n     recommended the study of counterpoint and frequently inquired of\r\n     him how far he had advanced in his studies. As a result of these\r\n     frequent incitations and the fact that he was still in the first\r\n     stages of his instruction, Beethoven, eager to learn, became\r\n     discontented and often gave expression to his dissatisfaction to\r\n     his friend. Gelinek took the matter much to heart and came to me\r\n     with the question whether I felt disposed to assist his friend\r\n     in the study of counterpoint. I now desired to become better\r\n     acquainted with Beethoven as soon as possible, and a day was fixed\r\n     for me to meet him in Gelinek’s lodgings and hear him play on the\r\n     pianoforte.\r\n\r\n     BEETHOVEN’S IMPROVISATIONS\r\n\r\n     Thus I saw the composer, now so famous, for the first time and\r\n     heard him play. After the customary courtesies he offered to\r\n     improvise on the pianoforte. He asked me to sit beside him. Having\r\n     struck a few chords and tossed off a few figures as if they were\r\n     of no significance, the creative genius gradually unveiled his\r\n     profound psychological pictures. My ear was continually charmed\r\n     by the beauty of the many and varied motives which he wove\r\n     with wonderful clarity and loveliness into each other, and I\r\n     surrendered my heart to the impressions made upon it while he gave\r\n     himself wholly up to his creative imagination, and anon, leaving\r\n     the field of mere tonal charm, boldly stormed the most distant\r\n     keys in order to give expression to violent passions....\r\n\r\n     The first thing that I did the next day was to visit the still\r\n     unknown artist who had so brilliantly disclosed his mastership.\r\n     On his writing desk I found a few passages from his first lesson\r\n     in counterpoint. A cursory glance disclosed the fact that, brief\r\n     as it was, there were mistakes in every key. Gelinek’s utterances\r\n     were thus verified. Feeling sure that my pupil was unfamiliar with\r\n     the preliminary rules of counterpoint, I gave him the familiar\r\n     textbook of Joseph Fux, “Gradus ad Parnassum,” and asked him\r\n     to look at the exercises that followed. Joseph Haydn, who had\r\n     returned to Vienna towards the end of the preceding year,[66]\r\n     was intent on utilizing his muse in the composition of large\r\n     masterworks, and thus laudably occupied could not well devote\r\n     himself to the rules of grammar. I was now eagerly desirous to\r\n     become the helper of the zealous student. But before beginning\r\n     the instruction I made him understand that our coöperation would\r\n     have to be kept secret. In view of this I recommended that he\r\n     copy every exercise which I corrected in order that Haydn should\r\n     not recognize the handwriting of a stranger when the exercise\r\n     was submitted to him. After a year, Beethoven and Gelinek had a\r\n     falling out for a reason that has escaped me; both, it seemed to\r\n     me, were at fault. As a result Gelinek got angry and betrayed my\r\n     secret. Beethoven and his brothers made no secret of it longer.\r\n\r\n     I began my honorable office with my good Louis in the beginning\r\n     of August, 1792,[67] and filled it uninterruptedly until May,\r\n     1793,[67] by which time he finished double counterpoint in the\r\n     octave and went to Eisenstadt. If His Royal Highness had sent his\r\n     charge at once to Albrechtsberger his studies would never have\r\n     been interrupted and he would have completed them.\r\n\r\nHere follows a passage, afterward stricken out by Schenk, in which he\r\nresents the statement that Beethoven had finished his studies with\r\nAlbrechtsberger. This would have been advisable, but if it were true,\r\nGelinek as well as Beethoven would have told him of the fact. “On the\r\ncontrary, he admitted to me that he had gone to Herr Salieri, Royal\r\nImperial Chapelmaster, for lessons in the free style of composition.”\r\nThen Schenk continues:\r\n\r\n     About the middle of May he told me that he would soon go with\r\n     Haydn to Eisenstadt and stay there till the beginning of winter;\r\n     he did not yet know the date of his departure. I went to him at\r\n     the usual hour in the beginning of June but my good Louis was no\r\n     longer to be seen. He left for me the following little billet\r\n     which I copy word for word:\r\n\r\n        “Dear Schenk!\r\n\r\n         It was not my desire to set off to-day for Eisenstadt. I should\r\n         like to have spoken with you again. Meanwhile rest assured of\r\n         my gratitude for the favors shown me. I shall endeavor with all\r\n         my might to requite them. I hope soon to see you again, and\r\n         once more to enjoy the pleasure of your society. Farewell and\r\n\r\n        do not entirely forget\r\n        your\r\n        Beethoven.”\r\n\r\n     It was my intention only briefly to touch upon my relations with\r\n     Beethoven; but the circumstances under which, and the manner in\r\n     which I became his guide in musical composition constrained me to\r\n     be somewhat more explicit. For my efforts (if they can be called\r\n     efforts) I was rewarded by my good Louis with a precious gift,\r\n     viz.: a firm bond of friendship which lasted without fading till\r\n     the day of his death.\r\n\r\n     Written in the summer of 1830.\r\n\r\nA chronological difficulty is presented by Schenk’s story of the\r\ncessation of the instruction. There can be no doubt that it began\r\ntowards the beginning of August, 1793, as confirmed by the distinct\r\nutterance of Schenk (who errs in the year, however), particularly\r\nby the statement that the study with Haydn had already endured six\r\nmonths. Schenk’s instruction is said to have lasted till the end of\r\nMay, 1794, and the definitive mention of the month makes an error\r\nimprobable. But at this time Haydn was already long in England, while\r\nSchenk’s narrative represents Beethoven as saying that he intended\r\ngoing to Eisenstadt with Haydn; moreover, Beethoven was already\r\nAlbrechtsberger’s pupil and as such was no longer in need of secret\r\nhelp. Nevertheless, the continuance of the relations with Schenk is\r\neasily possible and they were not likely to be interrupted so long as\r\nBeethoven remained in Vienna; this is indicated by the reference to\r\ndouble counterpoint, which Beethoven did not study under Haydn but with\r\nAlbrechtsberger; also Schenk’s intimation that if the Elector had sent\r\nhis charge “at once” to Albrechtsberger shows that instruction with the\r\nlatter had already begun. The letter to Schenk, though cast in friendly\r\nterms, can nevertheless be interpreted as a declination of further\r\nservices, a breaking off of the relationship between teacher and pupil,\r\nfor which the journey to Eisenstadt was a welcome excuse. But we learn\r\nonly from Schenk that Beethoven was to make the journey with Haydn, and\r\nhe may have been mistaken in this as he was in the year. It is very\r\nconceivable that Beethoven had received an invitation to visit him\r\nfrom Prince Esterhazy, who must surely have got acquainted with him\r\nin Vienna. He who is unwilling to accept this, must place the letter\r\nand the journey in the last months of 1793, which is in every respect\r\nimprobable.\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN’S RELATIONS WITH HAYDN\r\n\r\nThe relations between Haydn and his pupil did not long continue truly\r\ncordial; yet Beethoven concealed his dissatisfaction and no break\r\noccurred. Thoughtless and reckless of consequences, as he often\r\nin later years unfortunately exhibited himself when indulging his\r\nwilfulness, he was at this time responsible to the Elector for his\r\nconduct, and Haydn, moreover, was too valuable and influential a\r\nfriend to be wantonly alienated. So, whatever feelings he cherished in\r\nsecret, he kept them to himself, went regularly to his lessons and, as\r\nnoted above, occasionally treated his master to chocolate or coffee.\r\nIt was, of course, Haydn who took the young man to Eisenstadt, and,\r\nas Neefe tells us, he wished to take him to England. Why was that\r\nplan not carried out? Did Maximilian forbid it? Would Beethoven’s\r\npride not allow him to go thither as Haydn’s pupil? Did zeal for his\r\ncontrapuntal studies prevent it? Or had his relations to the Austrian\r\nnobility already become such as offered him higher hopes of success\r\nin Vienna than Haydn could propose in London? Or, finally, was it his\r\nambition rather to make himself known as Beethoven the composer than as\r\nBeethoven the pianoforte virtuoso? Pecuniary reasons are insufficient\r\nto account for the failure of the plan; for Haydn, who now knew the\r\nLondon public, could easily have removed all difficulty on that score.\r\nNeefe’s letter was written near the end of September, 1793, when\r\nalready “a number of reports” had reached Bonn “that Beethoven had made\r\ngreat progress in his art.” These “reports,” we know from Fischenich,\r\ncame in part from Haydn himself. Add to that the wish to take his\r\npupil with him to England--which was certainly the highest compliment\r\nhe could possibly have paid him--and the utter groundlessness of\r\nBeethoven’s suspicions that Haydn “was not well-minded towards him,”\r\nas Ries says in his “Notizen” (page 85), is apparent. Yet these\r\nsuspicions, added to the reasons above suggested, sufficiently explain\r\nthe departure of the master for London without the company of his\r\npupil, who now (January, 1794) was transferred to Albrechtsberger.\r\n\r\nIn the pretty extensive notes copied from the memorandum book already\r\nso much cited, there are but two which can with any degree of certainty\r\nbe referred to a date later than 1793. One of them is this:\r\n\r\n    Schuppanzigh, 3 times a W. (Week?)\r\n    Albrechtsberger, 3 times a W. (Week?)\r\n\r\nThe necessary inference from this is that Beethoven began the year 1794\r\nwith three lessons a week in violin-playing from Schuppanzigh (unless\r\nthe youth of the latter should forbid such an inference) and three in\r\ncounterpoint from the most famous teacher of that science. Seyfried\r\naffirms that the studies with the latter continued “two complete years\r\nwith tireless persistency.” The coming narrative will show that other\r\nthings took up much of Beethoven’s attention in 1795, and that before\r\nthe close of that year, if not already at its beginning, his course\r\nwith Albrechtsberger ended.[68]\r\n\r\nSTUDIES WITH ALBRECHTSBERGER\r\n\r\nThe instruction which Beethoven received from Albrechtsberger (and\r\nwhich was based chiefly on the master’s “Anweisung zur Komposition”)\r\nbegan again with simple counterpoint, in which Beethoven now\r\nreceived more detailed directions than had been given by Haydn.\r\nAlbrechtsberger wrote down rules for him, Beethoven did the same and\r\nworked out a large number of exercises on two plain-song melodies\r\nwhich Albrechtsberger then corrected according to the rules of strict\r\nwriting. There followed contrapuntal exercises in free writing,\r\nin imitation, in two-, three- and four-part fugue, choral fugue,\r\ndouble counterpoint in the different intervals, double fugue, triple\r\ncounterpoint and canon. The last was short, as here the instruction\r\nceased. Beethoven worked frequently in the immediate presence and\r\nwith the direct coöperation of Albrechtsberger. The latter labored\r\nwith obvious conscientiousness and care, and was ever ready to aid\r\nhis pupil. If he appears at times to have been given over to minute\r\ndetail and conventional method, it must be borne in mind that rigid\r\nschooling in fixed rules is essential to the development of an\r\nindependent artist, even if he makes no use of them, and that it is\r\nonly in this manner that freedom in workmanship can be achieved. Of\r\nthis the youthful Beethoven was aware and every line of his exercises\r\nbears witness that he entered into his studies with complete interest\r\nand undivided zeal.[69] This was particularly the case in his exercises\r\nin counterpoint and imitation, where he strove to avoid errors, and\r\ntheir beneficial results are plainly noticeable in his compositions.\r\nSeveral of the compositions written after the lessons, disclose how “he\r\nwas led from a predominantly figurative to a more contrapuntal manner\r\nof writing.” There is less of this observable in the case of fugue, in\r\nwhich the instruction itself was not free from deficiencies; and the\r\npupil worked more carelessly. The restrictive rules occasionally put\r\nhim out of conceit with his work; “he was at the age in which, as a\r\nrule, suggestion and incitation are preferred to instruction,” and his\r\nstubborn nature played an important rôle in the premises. However, it\r\nought to be added that he was also at an age when his genial aptness\r\nin invention and construction had already found exercise in other\r\ndirections. Even though he did not receive thorough education in fugue\r\nfrom Albrechtsberger, he nevertheless learned the constituent elements\r\nof the form and how to apply them. Moreover, in his later years he\r\nmade all these things the subjects of earnest and devoted study\r\nindependent of others; and in the compositions of his later years he\r\nreturned with special and manifest predilection to the fugued style.\r\nNothing could be more incorrect than to emphasize Beethoven’s lack of\r\ntheoretical education. If, while studying with Albrechtsberger, but\r\nmore particularly in his independent compositions, Beethoven ignored\r\nmany of the strict rules, it was not because he was not able to apply\r\nthem, but because he purposely set them aside. Places can be found in\r\nhis exercises in which the rules are violated; but the testimony of\r\nthe ear acquits the pupil. Rules are not the objects of themselves,\r\nthey do not exist for their own sake, and in despite of all artistic\r\nsystems; it is the reserved privilege of the evolution of art-means and\r\nprescient, forward genius to point out what in them is of permanent\r\nvalue, and what must be looked upon as antiquated. Nature designed\r\nthat Beethoven should employ music in the depiction of soul-states, to\r\nemancipate melody and express his impulses in the free forms developed\r\nby Ph. Em. Bach, Mozart, Haydn and their contemporaries. In this\r\ndirection he had already disclosed himself as a doughty warrior before\r\nthe instruction in Vienna had its beginning, and it is very explicable\r\nthat to be hemmed in by rigid rules was frequently disagreeable to him.\r\nHe gradually wearied of “creating musical skeletons.” But all the more\r\nworthy of recognition, yea, of admiration, is the fact that the young\r\ncomposer who had already mounted so high, should by abnegation of his\r\ncreative powers surrender himself to the tyranny of the rules and find\r\nsatisfaction in conscientious practice of them.\r\n\r\nNottebohm summed up his conclusions from the investigations which he\r\nmade of Beethoven’s posthumous papers thus: prefacing that, after 1785,\r\nBeethoven more and more made the manner of Mozart his own, he continues:\r\n\r\nWHAT BEETHOVEN LEARNED\r\n\r\n     The instruction which he received from Haydn and Albrechtsberger\r\n     enriched him with new forms and media of expression and these\r\n     effected a change in his mode of writing. The voices acquired\r\n     greater melodic flow and independence. A certain opacity took\r\n     the place of the former transparency in the musical fabric. Out\r\n     of a homophonic polyphony of two or more voices, there grew a\r\n     polyphony that was real. The earlier obbligato accompaniment gave\r\n     way to an obbligato style of writing which rested to a greater\r\n     extent on counterpoint. Beethoven has accepted the principle of\r\n     polyphony; his part-writing has become purer and it is noteworthy\r\n     that the compositions written immediately after the lessons are\r\n     among the purest that Beethoven ever composed. True, the Mozart\r\n     model still shines through the fabric, but we seek it less in the\r\n     art of figuration than in the form and other things which are\r\n     only indirectly associated with the obbligato style. Similarly,\r\n     we can speak of other influences--that of Joseph Haydn, for\r\n     instance. This influence is not contrapuntal. Beethoven built\r\n     upon his acquired and inherited possessions. He assimilated the\r\n     traditional forms and means of expression, gradually eliminated\r\n     foreign influences and, following the pressure of his subjective\r\n     nature with its inclination towards the ideal, he created his own\r\n     individual style.\r\n\r\nAs is known, Seyfried in his book entitled “Ludwig van Beethoven’s\r\nStudien im Generalbasse,” which appeared in 1832, gathered together all\r\nthat was to be found in the way of exercises, excerpts from textbooks,\r\netc., in Beethoven’s posthumous papers and presented them in so\r\nconfused and arbitrary a manner that only the keenness and patience of\r\na Nottebohm could point the way through the maze; Seyfried would have\r\nus believe that the entire contents of his book belonged to the studies\r\nunder Albrechtsberger.\r\n\r\n     It will require no waste of words, says Nottebohm (p. 198), to\r\n     prove the incompatibility of such a claim with the results of our\r\n     investigations. As a matter of fact, only the smallest portion\r\n     of the “Studies” can be traced back to the instruction which\r\n     Beethoven received from Albrechtsberger. The greater part had\r\n     nothing to do with this instruction and, aside from the changes\r\n     made, belongs to the other labors. In the smaller portion Seyfried\r\n     made things as easy for himself as possible. Of Beethoven’s\r\n     exercises he took only such as he found cleanly copied or legibly\r\n     written, and omitted those which were difficult to decipher\r\n     because of many corrections. This is the explanation of the fact\r\n     that Seyfried did not include a single exercise in strict simple\r\n     counterpoint. If all the passages bearing on the course followed\r\n     under Albrechtsberger were brought together and all the errors\r\n     made in the presentation overlooked, we should still have but a\r\n     fragmentary and faulty reflection of that study. Neither need\r\n     we enter upon a discussion of the marginal notes attributed to\r\n     Beethoven which so plentifully besprinkle Seyfried’s book. The\r\n     fact is that in all the manuscripts which belong to the studies\r\n     under Albrechtsberger not one of the “sarcastically thrown out”\r\n     marginal notes is to be found. The glosses which do appear as\r\n     Beethoven’s ... are of a wholly different character from those\r\n     printed by Seyfried. They show that Beethoven was deeply immersed\r\n     and interested in the matter. It would, indeed, be inexplicable\r\n     what could have persuaded Beethoven to continue study with a\r\n     teacher with whom, as Seyfried would have us believe, he was in\r\n     conflict already at the beginning of simple counterpoint. He had\r\n     it in his power to discontinue his studies at any moment.\r\n\r\nA doubt has been hinted above whether Beethoven’s studies under\r\nAlbrechtsberger were continued beyond the beginning of the year 1795.\r\nIf all these exercises in counterpoint, fugue and canon, and all\r\nthose excerpts from Fux, C. P. E. Bach, Türk, Albrechtsberger, and\r\nKirnberger, which Seyfried made the basis of his “Studien”--and mingled\r\nin a confusion inextricable by any one possessing less learning,\r\npatience, sagacity and perseverance than Nottebohm--had already\r\nbelonged to the period of his pupilage, their quantity alone, taken in\r\nconnection with the writer’s other occupations, would indeed preclude\r\nsuch a doubt; but knowing that perhaps the greater portion of those\r\nmanuscripts belongs to a period many years later, and considering the\r\ngreat facility in writing which Beethoven had already acquired before\r\ncoming to Vienna, there seems to be no indication of any course of\r\nstudy which might not easily be completed during the one year with\r\nHaydn (and Schenk) and one year with Albrechtsberger. Schönfeld, in\r\nthe “Jahrbuch der Tonkunst für Wien und Prag,” supposes that Beethoven\r\nwas still the pupil of the latter at the time when he wrote, which\r\nwas in the spring of 1795. His words are: “An eloquent proof of his\r\n[Beethoven’s] real love of art is the circumstance that he has placed\r\nhimself in the hands of our immortal Haydn, in order to be initiated\r\ninto the sacred mysteries of composition. This great master has, in\r\nhis absence, turned him over to our great Albrechtsberger.” There is\r\nnothing decisive in this; and yet it is all that appears to confirm\r\nthe “two years” of Seyfried; while on the other hand Wegeler, who,\r\nduring all the year 1795, was much with Beethoven, has nowhere in his\r\n“Notizen” any allusion whatever to his friend as being still a student\r\nunder a master.\r\n\r\nReferring to the number of pages (160) of exercises and the three\r\nlessons a week, Nottebohm calculates the period of instruction to have\r\nbeen about fifteen months. Inasmuch as among the exercises in double\r\ncounterpoint in the tenth there is found a sketch belonging to the\r\nsecond movement of the Trio, Op. 1, No. 2, which Trio was advertised\r\nas finished on May 9th, 1795, it follows that the study was at or\r\nnear its end at that date. The conclusion of his instruction from\r\nAlbrechtsberger may therefore be set down at between March and May,\r\n1795.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTION FROM SALIERI\r\n\r\nThe third of Beethoven’s teachers in Vienna was the Imperial\r\nChapelmaster Anton Salieri; but this instruction was neither systematic\r\nnor confined to regular hours. Beethoven took advantage of Salieri’s\r\nwillingness “to give gratuitous instruction to musicians of small\r\nmeans.” He wanted advice in vocal composition, and submitted to Salieri\r\nsome settings of Italian songs which the latter corrected in respect\r\nof verbal accent and expression, rhythm, metrical articulation,\r\nsubdivision of thought, mood, singableness, and the conduct of the\r\nmelody which comprehended all these things. Having himself taken\r\nthe initiative in this, Beethoven devoted himself earnestly and\r\nindustriously to these exercises, and they were notably profitable in\r\nhis creative work. “Thereafter [also in his German songs] he treated\r\nthe text with much greater care than before in respect of its prosodic\r\nstructure, as also of its contents and the prescribed situation,”\r\nand acquired a good method of declamation. That Salieri’s influence\r\nextended beyond the period in which Beethoven’s style developed\r\nitself independently cannot be asserted, since many other and varied\r\ninfluences made themselves felt later.\r\n\r\nThis instruction began soon after Beethoven’s arrival in Vienna and\r\nlasted in an unconstrained manner at least until 1802; at even a\r\nlater date he asked counsel of Salieri in the composition of songs,\r\nparticularly Italian songs. According to an anecdote related by Czerny,\r\nat one of these meetings for instruction Salieri found fault with a\r\nmelody as not being appropriate to the air. The next day he said to\r\nBeethoven: “I can’t get your melody out of my head.” “Then, Herr von\r\nSalieri,” replied Beethoven, “it cannot have been so utterly bad.”\r\nThe story may be placed in the early period; but it appears from a\r\nstatement by Moscheles that Beethoven still maintained an association\r\nwith Salieri in 1809. Moscheles, who was in Vienna at this time, found\r\na note on Salieri’s table which read: “The pupil Beethoven was here!”\r\n\r\nRies, speaking of the relations between Haydn, Albrechtsberger and\r\nSalieri as teachers and Beethoven as pupil, says: “I knew them all\r\nwell; all three valued Beethoven highly, but were also of one mind\r\ntouching his habits of study. All of them said Beethoven was so\r\nheadstrong and self-sufficient (_selbstwollend_) that he had to\r\nlearn much through harsh experience which he had refused to accept\r\nwhen it was presented to him as a subject of study.” Particularly\r\nAlbrechtsberger and Salieri were of this opinion; “the dry rules of the\r\nformer and the comparatively unimportant ones of the latter concerning\r\ndramatic composition (according to the Italian school of the period)\r\ncould not appeal to Beethoven.” It is now known that the “dry rules” of\r\nAlbrechtsberger could make a strong appeal to Beethoven as appertaining\r\nto theoretical study, and that the old method of composition to which\r\nhe remained true all his life always had a singular charm for him as a\r\nsubject of study and investigation.\r\n\r\nHere, as in many other cases, the simple statement of the difficulties\r\nsuggests their explanation. Beethoven the pupil may have honestly and\r\nconscientiously followed the precepts of his instructors in whatever\r\nhe wrote in that character; but Beethoven the composer stood upon his\r\nown territory, followed his own tastes and impulses, wrote and wrought\r\nsubject to no other control. He paid Albrechtsberger to teach him\r\ncounterpoint--not to be the censor and critic of his compositions. And\r\nRies’s memory may well have deceived him as to the actual scope of the\r\nstrictures made by the old master, and have transferred to the pupil\r\nwhat, fully thirty years before, had been spoken of the composer.\r\n\r\nAs has been mentioned, Beethoven’s relations with Salieri at a later\r\ndate were still pleasant; the composer dedicated to the chapelmaster\r\nthe three violin sonatas, Op. 12, which appeared in 1799. Nothing is\r\nknown of a dedication to Albrechtsberger. According to an anecdote\r\nrelated by Albrechtsberger’s grandson Hirsch, Beethoven called him a\r\n“musical pedant”; yet we may see a remnant of gratitude toward his\r\nold teacher in Beethoven’s readiness to take an interest in his young\r\ngrandson.\r\n\r\nWe have now to turn our attention to Beethoven’s relations to Viennese\r\nsociety outside of his study.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[63] Beethoven’s first lodgings were in an attic-room which he\r\nsoon exchanged for a room on the ground floor of a house No. 45\r\nAlsterstrasse occupied by one Strauss, a printer. The house now on the\r\nsite is No. 30. Another occupant of the house was Prince Lichnowsky,\r\nwho soon after took him into his lodgings. He remained in this house\r\nuntil May, 1795.\r\n\r\n[64] Or the beginning of 1794, since Haydn left Vienna on January 19,\r\nof that year.\r\n\r\n[65] The excerpt from Schenk’s autobiography which follows was\r\ncommunicated to Thayer by Otto Jahn and included in the appendix to\r\nVol. II of the original edition of this biography. The present editor\r\nhas followed Dr. Deiters in his presentation of the case in Vol. I of\r\nthe revised edition.\r\n\r\n[66] Haydn, according to Wurzbach, returned to Vienna on July 24, 1792.\r\n\r\n[67] Schenk is in error as to both dates. He means, of course, 1793 and\r\n1794.\r\n\r\n[68] The investigations of Nottebohm, in “Beethoven’s Studien” and\r\n“Beethoveniana,” have been relied on in the compilation of the story of\r\nthe study under Albrechtsberger, which takes the place of the original\r\nnarrative by Thayer.\r\n\r\n[69] Once Beethoven writes an unprepared seventh-chord with a\r\nsuspension on the margin of an exercise and adds the query: “Is it\r\nallowed?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII\r\n\r\n     Music in Vienna in 1793--Theatre, Church and Concert-Room--A\r\n     Music-Loving Nobility--The Esterhazys, Kinsky, Lichnowsky, von\r\n     Kees and van Swieten--Composers: Haydn, Kozeluch, Förster and\r\n     Eberl.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPERA AND CONCERTS IN VIENNA\r\n\r\nThe musical drama naturally took the first place in the musical life\r\nof Vienna at this period. The enthusiasm of Joseph II for a national\r\nGerman opera, to which the world owed Mozart’s exquisite “Entführung,”\r\nproved to be but short-lived, and the Italian _opera buffa_ resumed\r\nits old place in his affections. The new company engaged was, however,\r\nequal to the performance of “Don Giovanni” and “Figaro” and Salieri’s\r\nmagnificent “Axur.” Leopold II reached Vienna on the evening of March\r\n13, 1790, to assume the crown of his deceased brother, but no change\r\nwas, for the present, made in the court theatre. Indeed, as late as\r\nJuly 5 he had not entered a theatre, and his first appearance at the\r\nopera was at the performance of “Axur,” September 21, in the company\r\nof his visitor King Ferdinand of Naples; but once firmly settled on\r\nthe imperial throne, Joseph’s numerous reforms successfully annulled,\r\nthe Turkish war brought to a close and his diverse coronations happily\r\nended, the Emperor gave his thoughts to the theatre. Salieri, though\r\nnow but forty-one years of age, and rich with the observation and\r\nexperience of more than twenty years in the direction of the opera,\r\nwas, according to Mosel, graciously allowed, but according to other\r\nand better authorities, compelled, to withdraw from the operatic\r\norchestra and confine himself to his duties as director of the sacred\r\nmusic in the court chapel and to the composition of one operatic work\r\nannually, if required. The “Wiener Zeitung” of January 28, 1792,\r\nrecords the appointment of Joseph Weigl, Salieri’s pupil and assistant,\r\nnow twenty-five years old, “as Chapelmaster and Composer to the Royal\r\nImperial National Court Theatre with a salary of 1,000 florins.” The\r\ntitle Composer was rather an empty one. Though already favorably known\r\nto the public, he was forbidden to compose new operas for the court\r\nstage. To this end famous masters were to be invited to Vienna. A first\r\nfruit of this new order of things was the production of Cimarosa’s\r\n“Il Matrimonio segreto,” February 7, 1792, which with good reason so\r\ndelighted Leopold that he gave the performers a supper and ordered\r\nthem back into the theatre and heard the opera again _da capo_. It was\r\namong the last of the Emperor’s theatrical pleasures; he died March\r\n1st, and his wife on the 15th of May following. Thus for the greater\r\npart of the time from March 1 to May 24, the court theatres were shut;\r\nand yet during the thirteen months ending December 15, 1792, Italian\r\nopera had been given 180 times--134 times in the Burg and 46 times in\r\nthe Kärnthnerthor-Theater--and ballet 163 times; so that, as no change\r\nfor the present was made, there was abundance in these branches of the\r\nart for a young composer, like Beethoven, to hear and see. All accounts\r\nagree that the company then performing was one of uncommon excellence\r\nand its performances, with those of the superb orchestra, proved the\r\nvalue of the long experience, exquisite taste, unflagging zeal and\r\nprofound knowledge of their recent head, Salieri. Such as Beethoven\r\nfound the opera in the first week of November, 1792, such it continued\r\nfor the next two years--exclusively Italian, but of the first order.\r\n\r\nA single stroke of extraordinary good fortune--a happy accident is\r\nperhaps a better term--had just now given such prosperity to a minor\r\ntheatrical enterprise that in ten years it was to erect and occupy the\r\nbest playhouse in Vienna and, for a time, to surpass the Court Theatre\r\nin the excellence and splendor of its operatic performances. We mean\r\nSchikaneder’s Theater auf der Wieden; but in 1793 its company was mean,\r\nits house small, its performances bad enough.\r\n\r\nSchikaneder’s chapelmaster and composer was John Baptist Henneberg;\r\nthe chapelmaster of Marinelli, head of another German company in the\r\nLeopoldstadt, was Wenzel Müller, who had already begun his long list\r\nof 227 light and popular compositions to texts magical or farcical.\r\nSome two weeks after Beethoven’s arrival in Vienna, on November 23rd,\r\nSchikaneder announced, falsely, the one-hundredth performance of “Die\r\nZauberflöte,” an opera the success of which placed his theatre a few\r\nyears later upon a totally different footing, and brought Beethoven\r\ninto other relations to it than those of an ordinary visitor indulging\r\nhis comical taste, _teste_ Seyfried, for listening to and heartily\r\nenjoying very bad music.\r\n\r\nThe leading dramatic composers of Vienna, not yet named, must receive\r\na passing notice. Besides Cimarosa, who left Vienna a few months\r\nlater, Beethoven found Peter Dutillieu, a Frenchman by birth but an\r\nItalian musician by education and profession, engaged as composer for\r\nthe Court Theatre. His “Il Trionfo d’Amore” had been produced there\r\nNovember 14, 1791, and his “Nanerina e Padolfino” had lately come upon\r\nthe stage. Ignaz Umlauf, composer of “Die schöne Schusterin” and other\r\nnot unpopular works, had the title of Chapelmaster and Composer to\r\nthe German Court Opera, and was Salieri’s substitute as chapelmaster\r\nin the sacred music of the Court Chapel. Franz Xavier Süssmayr, so\r\nwell known from his connection with Mozart, was just now writing for\r\nSchikaneder’s stage; Schenk for Marinelli’s and for the private stages\r\nof the nobility; and Paul Wranitzky, first violinist and so-called\r\nMusikdirektor in the Court Theatre, author of the then popular “Oberon”\r\ncomposed for the Wieden stage, was employing his very respectable\r\ntalents for both Marinelli and Schikaneder.\r\n\r\nThe church music of Vienna seems to have been at a very low\r\npoint in 1792 and 1793. Two composers, however, whose names are\r\nstill of importance in musical history, were then in that city\r\ndevoting themselves almost exclusively to this branch of the art;\r\nAlbrechtsberger, Court Organist, but in a few months (through the death\r\nof Leopold Hoffmann, March 17, 1793) to become musical director at St.\r\nStephen’s; and Joseph Eybler (some five years older than Beethoven),\r\nwho had just become _Regens chori_ in the Carmelite church, whence he\r\nwas called to a similar and better position in the Schottische Kirche\r\ntwo years later.\r\n\r\nPublic concerts, as the term is now understood, may be said not to have\r\nexisted, and regular subscription concerts were few. Mozart gave a few\r\nseries of them, but after his death there appears to have been no one\r\nof sufficient note in the musical world to make such a speculation\r\nremunerative. Single subscription concerts given by virtuosos, and\r\nannual ones by some of the leading resident musicians, of course, took\r\nplace then as before and since. The only real and regular concerts were\r\nthe four annual performances in the Burgtheater, two at Christmas and\r\ntwo at Easter, for the benefit of the musicians’ widows and orphans.\r\nThese concerts, established mainly by Gassmann and Salieri, were never\r\nexclusive in their programmes--oratorio, symphony, cantata, concerto,\r\nwhatever would add to their attraction, found place. The stage was\r\ncovered with the best musicians and vocalists of the capital and the\r\nsuperb orchestra was equally ready to accompany the playing of a Mozart\r\nor of an ephemeral _Wunderkind_. Risbeck was told ten years before that\r\nthe number taking part in orchestra and chorus had even then on some\r\noccasions reached 400--a statement, however, which looks much like\r\nexaggeration.\r\n\r\nVery uncommon semi-private concerts were still kept up in 1793. The\r\nreader of Mozart’s biography will remember that in 1782 this great\r\ncomposer joined a certain Martin in giving a series of concerts during\r\nthe morning hours in the Augarten Hall, most of the performers being\r\ndilettanti and the music being furnished from the library of von Kees.\r\nThese concerts found such favor that they were renewed for several\r\nyears and generally were twelve in number.\r\n\r\n     Ladies of even the highest nobility permitted themselves to be\r\n     heard. The auditorium was extremely brilliant and everything was\r\n     conducted in so orderly and decent a fashion that everybody was\r\n     glad to support the institute to the best of his energies. The\r\n     receipts from the chief subscription were expended entirely on the\r\n     cost of the concerts. Later Herr Rudolph assumed the direction.\r\n     (“Allg. Mus. Zeitung,” III, 45.)\r\n\r\nThis man, still young, and a fine violin-player, was the director when\r\nBeethoven came to Vienna, and the extraordinary spectacle was still to\r\nbe seen of princes and nobles following his lead in the performance of\r\norchestral music to an audience of their own class at the strange hours\r\nof from 6 to 8 in the morning!\r\n\r\nFrom the above it appears that Vienna presented to the young musician\r\nno preëminent advantages either in opera, church-music or its public\r\nconcerts. Other cities equalled the Austrian capital in the first\r\ntwo, and London was then far in advance of all in the number, variety\r\nand magnificence of the last. It was in another field that Vienna\r\nsurpassed every competitor. As Gluck twenty years before had begun\r\nthe great revolution in operatic music completed by Mozart, so Haydn,\r\nbuilding on the foundation of the Bachs and aided by Mozart, was\r\neffecting a new development of purely instrumental music which was\r\nyet to reach its highest stage through the genius and daring of the\r\nyouth now his pupil. The example set by the Austrian family through\r\nso many generations had produced its natural effect, and a knowledge\r\nof and taste for music were universal among the princes and nobles\r\nof the empire. Some of the more wealthy princes, like Esterhazy,\r\nmaintained musical establishments complete even to the Italian opera;\r\nothers were contented with hearing the mass sung in their house-chapel\r\nto an orchestral accompaniment; where this was impossible, a small\r\norchestra only was kept up, often composed of the officials and\r\nservants, who were selected with regard to their musical abilities;\r\nand so down to the band of wind-instruments, the string quartet, and\r\neven to a single organ-player, pianist or violinist. What has been\r\nsaid in a former chapter of music as a quasi-necessity at the courts\r\nof the ecclesiastical princes, applies in great measure to the secular\r\nnobility. At their castles and country-seats in the summer, amusement\r\nwas to be provided for many an otherwise tedious hour; and in their\r\ncity residences during the winter they and their guests could not\r\nalways feast, dance or play at cards; and here, too, music became a\r\ncommon and favored recreation. At all events, it was the fashion.\r\nOutside the ranks of the noble-born, such as by talents, high culture\r\nor wealth occupied high social positions, followed the example and\r\nopened their salons to musicians and lovers of music, moved thereto for\r\nthe most part by a real, rarely by a pretended, taste for the art--in\r\neither case aiding and encouraging its progress. Hence, an enormous\r\ndemand for chamber music, both vocal and instrumental, especially\r\nthe latter. The demand created the supply by encouraging genius and\r\ntalent to labor in that direction; and thus the Austrian school of\r\ninstrumental music soon led the world, as in the previous generation\r\nthe demand for oratorios in England gave that country the supremacy in\r\nthat branch of art.\r\n\r\nDuring certain months of the year, Vienna was filled with the greatest\r\nnobles, not only of the Austrian states, but of other portions of the\r\nGerman Empire. Those who spent their time mostly in their own small\r\ncourts came up to the capital but for a short season; others reversed\r\nthis, making the city their usual residence and visiting their estates\r\nonly in summer. By the former class many a once (if not still) famous\r\ncomposer in their service was thus occasionally for short periods\r\nbrought to the metropolis--as Mozart by the brutal Archbishop of\r\nSalzburg, and Haydn by Prince Esterhazy. By the latter class many of\r\nthe distinguished composers and virtuosos resident in the city were\r\ntaken into the country during the summer to be treated as equals, to\r\nlive like gentlemen among gentlemen. Another mode of encouraging the\r\nart was the ordering or purchasing of compositions; and this not only\r\nfrom composers of established reputation, as Haydn, Mozart, C. P. E.\r\nBach, but also from young and as yet unknown men; thus affording a\r\ntwofold benefit--pecuniary aid and an opportunity of exhibiting their\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nThe instrumental virtuosos, when not permanently engaged in the\r\nservice of some prince or theatre, looked in the main for the reward\r\nof their studies and labors to the private concerts of the nobility.\r\nIf at the same time they were composers, it was in such concerts that\r\nthey brought their productions to a hearing. The reader of Jahn’s\r\nbiography of Mozart will remember how much even he depended upon this\r\nresource to gain the means of support for himself and family. Out of\r\nLondon, even so late as 1793, there can hardly be said to have existed\r\na “musical public,” as the term is now understood, and in Vienna\r\nat least, with its 200,000 inhabitants, a virtuoso rarely ventured\r\nto announce a concert to which he had not already a subscription,\r\nsufficient to ensure him against loss, from those at whose residences\r\nhe had successfully exhibited his skill. Beethoven, remaining “in\r\nVienna without salary until recalled” by Max, found in these resources\r\nand his pupils an ample income.\r\n\r\nBut this topic requires something more than the above general remarks.\r\nSome twelve years previous to Beethoven’s coming to Vienna, Risbeck,\r\nspeaking of the art in that capital, had written:\r\n\r\nORCHESTRAS OF THE GREAT NOBLES\r\n\r\n     Musicians are the only ones (artists) concerning whom the nobility\r\n     exhibit taste. Many houses maintain private bands for their own\r\n     delectation, and all the public concerts prove that this field of\r\n     art stands in high respect. It is possible to enlist four or five\r\n     large orchestras here, all of them incomparable. The number of\r\n     real virtuosos is small, but as regards the orchestral musicians\r\n     scarcely anything more beautiful is to be heard in the world.\r\n\r\nTITLED MUSIC-LOVERS IN VIENNA\r\n\r\nHow many such orchestras were still kept up in 1792-’93 it is,\r\nprobably, now impossible to determine. Those of Princes Lobkowitz,\r\nSchwarzenberg and Auersperg may safely be named. Count Heinrich von\r\nHaugwitz and doubtless Count Batthyany brought their musicians with\r\nthem when they came to the capital for “the season.” The Esterhazy\r\nband, dismissed after the death of Haydn’s old master, seems not yet to\r\nhave been renewed. Prince Grassalkowitz (or Kracsalkowitz) had reduced\r\nhis to a band of eight wind-instruments--oboes, clarinets, bassoons,\r\nhorns--a kind of organization then much in vogue. Baron Braun had one\r\nto play at dinner as at the supper in “Don Giovanni”--an accessory to\r\nthe scene which Mozart introduced out of his own frequent experience.\r\nPrince Karl Lichnowsky and others retained their own players of string\r\nquartets.\r\n\r\nThe grandees of the Bohemian and Moravian capitals--Kinsky, Clamm,\r\nNostiz, Thun, Buquoi, Hartig, Salm-Pachta, Sporck, Fünfkirchen,\r\netc.--emulated the Austrian and Hungarian nobles. As many of them had\r\npalaces also in Vienna, and most, if not all, spent part of the year\r\nthere, bringing with them a few of the more skilful members of their\r\norchestras to execute chamber music and for the nucleus of a band\r\nwhen symphonies, concertos and grand vocal works were to be executed,\r\nthey also added their contingent to the musical as well as to the\r\npolitical and fashionable life of the metropolis. The astonishingly\r\nfruitful last eight years of Mozart’s life falling within the period\r\nnow under contemplation, contributed to musical literature compositions\r\nwonderfully manifold in character and setting an example that forced\r\nother composers to leave the beaten track. Haydn had just returned\r\nfrom his first stay in London, enriched with the pregnant experience\r\nacquired during that visit. Van Swieten had gained during his residence\r\nin Berlin appreciation of and love for the works of Handel, Bach and\r\ntheir schools, and since his return to Vienna, about 1778, had exerted,\r\nand was still exerting, a very powerful and marked influence upon\r\nVienna’s musical taste.\r\n\r\nThus all the conditions precedent for the elevation of the art were\r\njust at this time fulfilled at Vienna, and in one department--that of\r\ninstrumental music--they existed in a degree unknown in any other city.\r\nThe extraordinary results as to the quantity produced in those years\r\nmay be judged from the sale-catalogue (1779) of a single music-dealer,\r\nJohann Traeg, which gives of symphonies, symphonies-concertantes and\r\novertures (the last being in a small minority) the extraordinary\r\nnumber of 512. The music produced at private concerts given by the\r\nnobility ranged from the grand oratorios, operas, symphonies, down to\r\nvariations for the pianoforte and to simple songs. Leading musicians\r\nand composers, whose circumstances admitted of it, also gave private\r\nconcerts at which they made themselves and their works known, and to\r\nwhich their colleagues were invited. Prince Lobkowitz, at the time\r\nBeethoven reached Vienna, was a young man of twenty years. He was born\r\non December 7, 1772, and had just married, on August 2, a daughter of\r\nPrince Schwarzenberg. He was a violinist of considerable powers and so\r\ndevoted a lover of music and the drama, so profuse a squanderer of his\r\nincome upon them, as in twenty years to reduce himself to bankruptcy.\r\nPrecisely Beethoven’s supposed age, the aristocrat of wealth and power\r\nand the aristocrat of talent and genius became exceedingly intimate,\r\noccasionally quarrelling and making up their differences as if\r\nbelonging by birth to the same sphere.\r\n\r\nThe reigning Prince Esterhazy was that Paul Anton who, after the death\r\nof his father on February 25, 1790, broke up the musical establishment\r\nat Esterhaz and gave Haydn relief from his thirty years of service.\r\nHe died on January 22, 1794, and was succeeded by his son Nicholas,\r\na young man just five years older than Beethoven. Prince Nicholas\r\ninherited his grandfather’s taste for music, reëngaged an orchestra,\r\nand soon became known as one of the most zealous promoters of Roman\r\nCatholic church-music. The best composers of Vienna, including\r\nBeethoven, wrote masses for the chapel at Esterhaz, where they were\r\nperformed with great splendor.\r\n\r\nCount Johann Nepomuk Esterhazy, “of the middle line zu Frakno,” was a\r\nman of forty-five years, a good performer upon the oboe, and (which is\r\nmuch to his credit) had been a firm friend and patron of Mozart.\r\n\r\nOf Count Franz Esterhazy, a man of thirty-five years, Schönfeld,\r\nin his “Jahrbuch der Tonkunst,” thus speaks: “This great friend of\r\nmusic at certain times of the year gives large and splendid concerts\r\nat which, for the greater part, large and elevated compositions are\r\nperformed--particularly the choruses of Handel, the ‘Sanctus’ of\r\nEmanuel Bach, the ‘Stabat Mater’ of Pergolese, and the like. At these\r\nconcerts there are always a number of the best virtuosos.”\r\n\r\nIt was not the present Prince Joseph Kinsky (who died in 1798 in his\r\nforty-eighth year) who at a later period became a distinguished patron\r\nof Beethoven, but his son Ferdinand Johann Nepomuk, then a bright boy\r\nof eleven years, born on December 4, 1781, upon whose youthful taste\r\nthe strength, beauty and novelty of that composer’s works made a deep\r\nimpression. Prince Carl Lichnowsky, the pupil and friend of Mozart, had\r\na quartet concert at his dwelling every Friday morning. The regularly\r\nengaged musicians were Ignaz Schuppanzigh, son of a professor in the\r\nReal-Schule, and a youth at this time of sixteen years (if the musical\r\nlexica are to be trusted), first violin; Louis Sina, pupil of Förster,\r\nalso a very young man, second violin; Franz Weiss, who completed\r\nhis fifteenth year on January 18, 1793, viola; and Anton Kraft, or\r\nhis son Nicholas, a boy of fourteen years (born December 18, 1778),\r\nvioloncello. It was, in fact, a quartet of boy virtuosos, of whom\r\nBeethoven, several years older, could make what he would.\r\n\r\nThe Prince’s wife was Marie Christine, twenty years of age, one of\r\nthose “Three Graces,” as Georg Förster called them, daughters of that\r\nCountess Thun in whose house Mozart had found such warm friendship and\r\nappreciation, and whose noble qualities are so celebrated by Burney,\r\nReichardt and Förster. The Princess, as well as her husband, belonged\r\nto the better class of amateur performers upon the pianoforte.\r\n\r\nCourt Councillor von Kees, Vice-President of the Court of Appeals of\r\nLower Austria, was still living. He was, says Gyrowetz, speaking of a\r\nperiod a few years earlier, “recognized as the foremost music-lover\r\nand dilettante in Vienna; and twice a week he gave in his house\r\nsociety concerts at which were gathered together the foremost virtuosos\r\nof Vienna, and the first composers, such as Joseph Haydn, Mozart,\r\nDittersdorf, Hoffmeister, Albrechtsberger, Giarnovichi and so on.\r\nHaydn’s symphonies were played there.” In Haydn’s letters to Madame\r\nGenzinger the name of von Kees often occurs--the last time in a note of\r\nAugust 4, 1792, which mentions that the writer is that day to dine with\r\nthe Court Councillor. This distinguished man left on his death (January\r\n5, 1795) a very extensive collection of music.\r\n\r\nGottfried, Freiherr van Swieten, son of Maria Theresia’s famous Dutch\r\nphysician, says Schönfeld, is,\r\n\r\nVAN SWIETEN AND HIS INFLUENCE\r\n\r\n     as it were, looked upon as a patriarch of music. He has taste only\r\n     for the great and exalted. He himself many years ago composed\r\n     twelve beautiful symphonies (“stiff as himself,” said Haydn). When\r\n     he attends a concert our semi-connoisseurs never take their eyes\r\n     off him, seeking to read in his features, not always intelligible\r\n     to every one, what ought to be their opinion of the music. Every\r\n     year he gives a few large and brilliant concerts at which only\r\n     music by the old masters is performed. His preference is for the\r\n     Handelian manner, and he generally has some of Handel’s great\r\n     choruses performed. As late as last Christmas (1794) he gave such\r\n     a concert at Prince von Paar’s, at which an oratorio by this\r\n     master was performed.\r\n\r\nNeukomm told Prof. Jahn that in concerts, “if it chanced that a\r\nwhispered conversation began, His Excellency, who was in the habit of\r\nsitting in the first row of seats, would rise solemnly, draw himself up\r\nto his full height, turn to the culprits, fix a long and solemn gaze\r\nupon them, and slowly resume his chair. It was effective, always.” He\r\nhad some peculiar notions of composition; he was, for instance, fond\r\nof imitations of natural sounds in music and forced upon Haydn the\r\nimitation of frogs in “The Seasons.” Haydn himself says:\r\n\r\n     This entire passage in imitation of a frog did not flow from my\r\n     pen. I was constrained to write down the French croak. At an\r\n     orchestral performance this wretched conceit soon disappears, but\r\n     it cannot be justified in a pianoforte score. Let the critics be\r\n     not too severe on me. I am an old man and cannot revise all this\r\n     again.\r\n\r\nBut to van Swieten, surely, is due the credit of having founded in\r\nVienna a taste for Handel’s oratorios and Bach’s organ and pianoforte\r\nmusic, thus adding a new element to the music there. The costs of the\r\noratorio performances were not, however, defrayed by him, as Schönfeld\r\nseems to intimate. They were met by the association called by him into\r\nbeing, and of which he was perpetual secretary, whose members were the\r\nPrinces Liechtenstein, Esterhazy, Schwarzenberg, Auersperg, Kinsky,\r\nTrautmannsdorf, Sinsendorf, and the Counts Czernin, Harrach, Erdödy and\r\nFries; at whose palaces as well as in van Swieten’s house and sometimes\r\nin the great hall of the Imperial Royal Library the performances were\r\ngiven at midday to an audience of invited guests. Fräulein Martinez,\r\nwho holds so distinguished a place in Burney’s account of his visit\r\nto Vienna--that pupil of Porpora at whose music-lessons the young\r\nJoseph Haydn forty years before had been employed as accompanist--still\r\nflourished in the Michael’s House and gave a musical party every\r\nSaturday evening during the season.\r\n\r\n     Court Councillor and Chamber Paymaster von Meyer (says Schönfeld)\r\n     is so excellent a lover of music that his entire personnel in the\r\n     chancellary is musical, among them being such artists as a Raphael\r\n     and a Hauschka. It will readily be understood, therefore, that\r\n     here in the city as well as at his country-seat there are many\r\n     concerts. His Majesty the Emperor himself has attended some of\r\n     these concerts.\r\n\r\nThese details are sufficient to illustrate and confirm the remarks\r\nmade above upon Vienna as the central point of instrumental music. Of\r\nthe great number of composers in that branch of the art whom Beethoven\r\nfound there, a few of the more eminent must be named.\r\n\r\nFAMOUS COMPOSERS IN VIENNA\r\n\r\nOf course, Haydn stood at the head. The next in rank--_longo\r\nintervallo_--was Mozart’s successor in the office of Imperial Chamber\r\nComposer, Leopold Kozeluch, a Bohemian, now just forty years of age.\r\nThough now forgotten and, according to Beethoven, “miserabilis,” he\r\nwas renowned throughout Europe for his quartets and other chamber\r\nmusic. A man of less popular repute but of a solid genius and\r\nacquirements far beyond those of Kozeluch, whom Beethoven greatly\r\nrespected and twenty-five years later called his “old master,” was\r\nEmanuel Aloys Förster, a Silesian, now forty-five years of age. His\r\nquintets, quartets and the like ranked very high, but at that time\r\nwere known for the most part only in manuscript. Anton Eberl, five\r\nyears the senior of Beethoven, a Viennese by birth, had composed\r\ntwo operettas in the sixteenth year of his age which were produced\r\nat the Kärnthnerthor-Theater, one of which gained the young author\r\nthe favor of Gluck. He seems to have been a favorite of Mozart and\r\ncaught so much of the spirit and style of that master as to produce\r\ncompositions which were printed by dishonest publishers under Mozart’s\r\nname, and as his were sold throughout Europe. In 1776 he accompanied\r\nthe Widow Mozart and her sister, Madame Lange, the vocalist, in the\r\ntour through Germany, gaining that reputation in other cities which\r\nhe enjoyed at home, both as pianist and composer. His force was in\r\ninstrumental composition, and we shall hereafter see him for a moment\r\nas a symphonist bearing away the palm from Beethoven!\r\n\r\nJohann Vanhall, whose name was so well known in Paris and London that\r\nBurney, twenty years before, sought him out in his garret in a suburb\r\nof Vienna, was as indefatigable as ever in production. Gerber says in\r\nhis first Lexicon (1792) that Breitkopf and Härtel had then fifty of\r\nhis symphonies in manuscript. His fecundity was equal to that of Haydn;\r\nhis genius such that all his works are now forgotten. It is needless to\r\ncontinue this list.\r\n\r\nOne other fact illustrating the musical tastes and accomplishments of\r\nthe higher classes of the capital may be added. There were, during\r\nthe winter 1792-93, ten private theatres with amateur companies in\r\nactivity, of which the more important were in the residences of the\r\nnobles Stockhammer, Kinsky, Sinsendorf and Strassaldo, and of the\r\nbookseller Schrambl. Most of these companies produced operas and\r\noperettas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII\r\n\r\n     Beethoven in Society--Concerts--Wegeler’s\r\n     Recollections--Compositions--The First Trios--Sonatas Dedicated to\r\n     Haydn--Variations--Dances for the Ridotto Rooms--Plays at Haydn’s\r\n     Concert.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever quiet and “without observation” Beethoven’s advent in Vienna\r\nmay have been at that time when men’s minds were occupied by movements\r\nof armies and ideas of revolution, he could hardly have gone thither\r\nunder better auspices. He was Court Organist and Pianist to the\r\nEmperor’s uncle; his talents in that field were well known to the many\r\nAustrians of rank who had heard him in Bonn when visiting there or\r\nwhen paying their respects to the Elector in passing to and from the\r\nAustrian Netherlands; he was a pupil of Joseph Haydn--a circumstance\r\nin itself sufficient to secure him a hearing; and he was protected\r\nby Count Waldstein, whose family connections were such that he could\r\nintroduce his favorite into the highest circles, the imperial house\r\nonly excepted. Waldstein’s mother was a Liechtenstein; his grandmother\r\na Trautmannsdorf; three of his sisters had married respectively\r\ninto the families Dietrichstein, Crugenburg and Wallis; and by the\r\nmarriages of uncles and aunts he was connected with the great houses\r\nOettingen-Spielberg, Khevenhüller-Melisch, Kinsky, Palfy von Erdöd and\r\nUlfeld--not to mention others less known. If the circle be extended\r\nby a degree or two it embraces the names Kaunitz, Lobkowitz, Kohary,\r\nFünfkirchen, Keglevics and Colloredo-Mansfeld.\r\n\r\nDr. Burney, in closing his “Present State of Music in Germany,” notes\r\nthe distinction in the styles of composition and performance in some\r\nof the principal cities of that country, “Vienna being most remarkable\r\nfor fire and animation; Mannheim for neat and brilliant execution;\r\nBerlin for counterpoint and Brunswick for taste.” Since Burney’s tour\r\n(1772) Vienna had the highest example of all these qualities united\r\nin Mozart. But he had passed away, and no great pianist of the first\r\nrank remained; there were extraordinary dilettanti and professional\r\npianists “of very neat and brilliant execution,” but none who possessed\r\ngreat “fire, animation and invention,” qualities still most valued in\r\nVienna and in which the young Beethoven, with all the hardness and\r\nheaviness of manipulation caused by his devotion to the organ, was\r\nwholly unrivalled. With all the salons in the metropolis open to him,\r\nhis success as a virtuoso was, therefore, certain. All the contemporary\r\nauthorities, and all the traditions of those years, agree in the fact\r\nof that success, and that his playing of Bach’s preludes and fugues\r\nespecially, his reading of the most difficult scores at sight and\r\nhis extemporaneous performances excited ever new wonder and delight.\r\nSchindler records that van Swieten, after musical performances at his\r\nhouse, “detained Beethoven and persuaded him to add a few fugues by\r\nSebastian Bach as an evening blessing,” and he preserves a note without\r\ndate, though evidently belonging to Beethoven’s first years in Vienna,\r\nwhich proves how high a place the young man had then won in the old\r\ngentleman’s favor:\r\n\r\n     To Mr. Beethoven in Alstergasse, No. 45, with the Prince\r\n     Lichnowsky: If there is nothing to hinder next Wednesday I should\r\n     be glad to see you at my home at half past 8 with your nightcap in\r\n     your bag. Give me an immediate answer.\r\n\r\n    Swieten.\r\n\r\nThere is also an entry in the oft-cited memorandum book belonging\r\nin date to October or November, 1793, which may be given in this\r\nconnection: “Supped in the evening at Swieten’s, 17 pourboire. To the\r\njanitor 4 x for opening the door.”\r\n\r\nTHE THREE TRIOS, OP. 1\r\n\r\nBut the instant and striking success of Beethoven as virtuoso by no\r\nmeans filled up the measure of his ambition. He aspired to the higher\r\nposition of composer, and to obtain this more was needed than the\r\nperformance of variations, however excellent. To this end he selected\r\nthe three Trios afterwards published as Op. 1, and brought them\r\nto performance at the house of Prince Lichnowsky. Happily for us,\r\nBeethoven related some particulars concerning this first performance of\r\nthese compositions in Vienna to his pupil Ries, who gives the substance\r\nof the story thus:\r\n\r\n     It was planned to introduce the first three Trios of Beethoven,\r\n     which were about to be published as Op. 1, to the artistic world\r\n     at a soirée at prince Lichnowsky’s. Most of the artists and\r\n     music-lovers were invited, especially Haydn, for whose opinion\r\n     all were eager. The Trios were played and at once commanded\r\n     extraordinary attention. Haydn also said many pretty things about\r\n     them, but advised Beethoven not to publish the third, in C minor.\r\n     This astonished Beethoven, inasmuch as he considered the third\r\n     the best of the Trios, as it is still the one which gives the\r\n     greatest pleasure and makes the greatest effect. Consequently,\r\n     Haydn’s remark left a bad impression on Beethoven and led him to\r\n     think that Haydn was envious, jealous and ill-disposed toward him.\r\n     I confess that when Beethoven told me of this I gave it little\r\n     credence. I therefore took occasion to ask Haydn himself about\r\n     it. His answer, however, confirmed Beethoven’s statement; he said\r\n     he had not believed that this Trio would so quickly and easily be\r\n     understood and so favorably received by the public.\r\n\r\nThe Fischoff manuscript says:\r\n\r\n     The three Trios for pianoforte, violin and violoncello, Op. 1\r\n     (the pearls of all sonatas), which are in fact his sixth work,\r\n     justly excited admiration, though they were performed in only a\r\n     few circles. Wherever this was done, however, connoisseurs and\r\n     music-lovers bestowed upon them undivided applause, which grew\r\n     with the succeeding works as the hearers not only accustomed\r\n     themselves to the striking and original qualities of the master\r\n     but grasped his spirit and strove for the high privilege of\r\n     understanding him.\r\n\r\nMore than two years passed by, however, before the composer thought\r\nfit to send these Trios to the press; perhaps restrained by a feeling\r\nof modesty, since he was still a student, perhaps by a doubt as to the\r\nsuccess of compositions so new in style, or by prudence, choosing to\r\ndelay their publication until they had been so often performed from\r\nthe manuscript as to secure their comprehension and appreciation, and\r\nthus an adequate number of subscribers. In the meantime he prepared\r\nthe way for them by publishing a few sets of variations. “Beethoven\r\nhad composed variations on themes from Mozart’s ‘Zauberflöte,’ which\r\nhe had already sketched in Bonn, and Zmeskall took it upon himself\r\nto submit them to a publisher; but they had only a small sale.” (The\r\nFischoff MS.) This refers doubtless to the Variations “Se vuol ballare”\r\nfrom “Le Nozze di Figaro,” which, having been revised and improved by\r\na new coda, came out in July, 1793, with a dedication to Eleonore von\r\nBreuning. It was not until the next year that the thirteen variations\r\nupon the theme “Es war einmal ein alter Mann,” from Dittersdorf’s\r\n“Rothkäppchen,” appeared, and these were followed by those for four\r\nhands on the Waldstein theme, first advertised in January, 1795.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Beethoven evidently was in no haste to publish his\r\ncompositions. It will presently be seen that he sent the “Se vuol\r\nballare” variations to press partly at the request of others and partly\r\nto entrap the rival pianists of Vienna. A few years later we shall\r\nfind him dashing off and immediately publishing variations on popular\r\ntheatrical melodies; but works of greater scope, and especially his\r\npianoforte concertos, were for the most part long retained in his\r\nexclusive possession. Thus the Pianoforte Concerto in B-flat major,\r\nOp. 18, though supposed by Tomaschek to have been composed at Prague\r\nin 1798, certainly (if Beethoven’s own words in a letter to Breitkopf\r\nand Härtel are to be believed) preceded in composition that in C major,\r\nOp. 15, and must, therefore, have been finished at the latest in March,\r\n1795, and was doubtless often played by him at private concerts during\r\nthe period now before us. It was not published until 1801.\r\n\r\nLet the reader now recall to mind some of the points previously dwelt\r\nupon: the Fischenich letter of January and Neefe’s letter of October,\r\n1793, which record the favorable reports sent to Bonn of Beethoven’s\r\nmusical progress; his studies with Haydn and Schenk; the cares and\r\nperplexities caused him temporarily by the death of his father, and\r\nthe unpleasant circumstances attending that event; his steady success\r\nas a virtuoso; his visit in the summer to Prince Esterhazy; and it is\r\nobvious with what industry and energy he engaged in his new career,\r\nwith what zeal and unfaltering activity he labored to make the most of\r\nhis opportunities. In one year after leaving Bonn he felt his success\r\nsecure, and no longer feared Hamlet’s “slings and arrows of outrageous\r\nfortune.” This is indicated in a passage (“O, how we shall then rejoice\r\ntogether,” etc.) of the earliest of his Vienna letters which has been\r\npreserved--that letter in which, as Wegeler remarks, “he asked pardon\r\nfor much more error than he had committed,” and which, though often\r\nreprinted from the “Notizen,” is too important and characteristic to be\r\nhere omitted.\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN SUES FOR PARDON\r\n\r\n    Vienna, November 2, 93.\r\n\r\n    Most estimable Leonore!\r\n    My most precious friend!\r\n\r\n     Not until I have lived almost a year in the capital do you receive\r\n     a letter from me, and yet you were most assuredly perpetually in\r\n     my liveliest memory. Often in thought I have conversed with you\r\n     and your dear family, though not with that peace of mind which I\r\n     could have desired. It was then that the wretched misunderstanding\r\n     hovered before me and my conduct presented itself as most\r\n     despicable. But it was too late. O, what would I not give could I\r\n     obliterate from my life those actions so degrading to myself and\r\n     so contrary to my character. True, there were many circumstances\r\n     which tended to estrange us, and I suspect that tales whispered\r\n     in our ears of remarks made one about the other were chiefly\r\n     that which prevented us from coming to an understanding. We both\r\n     believed that we were speaking from conviction; whereas it was\r\n     only in anger, and we were both deceived. Your good and noble\r\n     character, my dear friend, is sufficient assurance to me that\r\n     you forgave me long ago. But we are told that the sincerest\r\n     contrition consists in acknowledgment of our faults; and to\r\n     do this has been my desire. And now let us drop the curtain on\r\n     the affair, only drawing from it this lesson--that when friends\r\n     quarrel it is much better to have it out face to face than to turn\r\n     to a go-between.\r\n\r\n     With this you will receive a dedication from me to you concerning\r\n     which I only wish that the work were a larger one and more worthy\r\n     of you. I was plagued here to publish the little work, and I took\r\n     advantage of the opportunity, my estimable E., to show my respect\r\n     and friendship for you and my enduring memory of your family. Take\r\n     this trifle and remember that it comes from a friend who respects\r\n     you greatly. Oh, if it but gives you pleasure, my wishes will\r\n     be completely fulfilled. Let it be a reminder of the time when\r\n     I spent so many and such blessed hours at your home. Perhaps it\r\n     will keep me in your recollection until I eventually return to\r\n     you, which, it is true, is not likely to be soon. But how we shall\r\n     rejoice then, my dear friend--you will then find in your friend a\r\n     happier man, from whose visage time and a kindlier fate shall have\r\n     smoothed out all the furrows of a hateful past.\r\n\r\n     If you should chance to see B. Koch, please say to her that it is\r\n     not nice of her never once to have written to me. I wrote to her\r\n     twice and three times to Malchus, but no answer. Say to her that\r\n     if she doesn’t want to write she might at least urge Malchus to\r\n     do so. In conclusion I venture a request; it is this: I should\r\n     like once again to be so happy as to own a waistcoat knit of\r\n     hare’s wool by your hands, my dear friend. Pardon the immodest\r\n     request, my dear friend, but it proceeds from a great predilection\r\n     for everything that comes from your hands. Privately I may also\r\n     acknowledge that a little vanity is also involved in the request;\r\n     I want to be able to say that I have something that was given me\r\n     by the best and most estimable girl in Bonn. I still have the\r\n     waistcoat which you were good enough to give me in Bonn, but it\r\n     has grown so out of fashion that I can only treasure it in my\r\n     wardrobe as something very precious because it came from you. You\r\n     would give me much pleasure if you were soon to rejoice me with a\r\n     dear letter from yourself. If my letters should in any way please\r\n     you I promise in this to be at your command so far as lies in my\r\n     power, as everything is welcome to me which enables me to show how\r\n     truly I am\r\n\r\n    Your admiring,\r\n    true friend\r\n    L. v. Beethoven.\r\n\r\n     P.S. The V. [variations] you will find a little difficult to play,\r\n     especially the trills in the _coda_; but don’t let that alarm you.\r\n     It is so contrived that you need play only the trill, leaving out\r\n     the other notes because they are also in the violin part. I never\r\n     would have composed a thing of the kind had I not often observed\r\n     that here and there in Vienna there was somebody who, after I had\r\n     improvised of an evening, noted down many of my peculiarities,\r\n     and made parade of them next day as his own. Foreseeing that\r\n     some of these things would soon appear in print, I resolved to\r\n     anticipate them. Another reason that I had was to embarrass the\r\n     local pianoforte masters. Many of them are my deadly enemies and\r\n     I wanted to revenge myself on them, knowing that once in a while\r\n     somebody would ask them to play the variations and they would make\r\n     a sorry show with them.\r\n\r\nExcept Beethoven’s memorandum, “Schuppanzigh 3 times each W.;\r\nAlbrechtsberger 3 times each W.”, which indicates his change of\r\ninstructors, there is nothing to be recorded until, probably in May\r\nor June (1794), we come to the fragment of another letter to Eleonore\r\nvon Breuning also contained in Wegeler’s “Notizen” (p. 60), which\r\nhas particular interest both as showing how bitterly his conscience\r\nreproached him for acts inconsistent with the forbearance and command\r\nof temper due to friendship, but in which he ever remained too apt\r\nto indulge, and as adding some implied confirmation of the argument\r\npreviously made in relation to the compositions of the Bonn period. In\r\nthis letter he acknowledges receipt of a cravat embroidered by Eleonore\r\nand protests that thoughts of her generosity and his unworthiness had\r\nbrought him to tears. He continues: “Do pray believe me that little as\r\nI have deserved it, _my friend_ (let me always call you such), I have\r\nsuffered much and still suffer from the loss of your friendship.... As\r\na slight return for your kind recollection of me I take the liberty of\r\nsending these Variations and the Rondo with violin (accompaniment).\r\nI have a great deal to do or I should have transcribed the Sonata I\r\npromised you long ago. It is a mere sketch in manuscript, and to copy\r\nit would be a difficult, etc.” The letter is signed: “The friend who\r\nstill reveres you, Beethowen” (_sic_).[70]\r\n\r\nIn January, 1794, Elector Max had paid a short visit to Vienna, where,\r\nperhaps, it was determined that Beethoven should remain “without salary\r\nuntil recalled.” After the declaration of war by the Empire against\r\nFrance, the electorate, as a German state, could no longer remain\r\nneutral; and thus it came to pass that in October the victorious French\r\narmy marched into Bonn. The Elector fled to Frankfort-on-the-Main,\r\nNovember 6th, thence to Münster, while his court and all such as were\r\nobnoxious to the republican authorities dispersed in all directions for\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nOne of these fugitives, a young man of twenty-nine years but already\r\nthe Rector of the University, to “save his head” hastened away to\r\nVienna--Dr. Wegeler. He reached that capital in October and found\r\nBeethoven not in the “room on the ground floor” where “it was not\r\nnecessary to pay the housekeeper more than 7 florins,” but living as\r\na guest in the family of Prince Karl Lichnowsky; and this explains\r\nsufficiently the cessation of those records of monthly payments before\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\nDR. WEGELER’S REMINISCENCES\r\n\r\nThe reminiscences of Wegeler for the period of his stay in Vienna,\r\nexcepting those which may be better introduced chronologically in\r\nother connections, may well find place here. They are interesting and\r\ncharacteristic in themselves and indicate, also, the great change for\r\nthe better in Beethoven’s pecuniary condition; for a man who keeps a\r\nservant and a horse cannot, if honest, be a sufferer from poverty:\r\n\r\n     Carl, Prince of Lichnowsky, Count Werdenberg, Dynast Granson, was\r\n     a very great patron, yes, a friend of Beethoven’s, who took him\r\n     into his house as a guest, where he remained at least a few years.\r\n     I found him there toward the end of the year 1794, and left him\r\n     there in the middle of 1796. Meanwhile, however, Beethoven had\r\n     almost always a home in the country.\r\n\r\n     The Prince was a great lover and connoisseur of music. He played\r\n     the pianoforte, and by studying Beethoven’s pieces and playing\r\n     them more or less well, sought to convince him that there was no\r\n     need of changing anything in his style of composition, though the\r\n     composer’s attention was often called to the difficulties of his\r\n     works. There were performances at his house every Friday morning,\r\n     participated in by four hired musicians--Schuppanzigh, Weiss,\r\n     Kraft and another (Link?), besides our friend; generally also an\r\n     amateur, Zmeskall. Beethoven always listened with pleasure to the\r\n     observations of these gentlemen. Thus, to cite a single instance,\r\n     the famous violoncellist Kraft in my presence called his attention\r\n     to a passage in the finale of the Trio, Op. 1, No. 3, to the fact\r\n     that it ought to be marked “sulla corda G,” and the indication 4-4\r\n     time which Beethoven had marked in the finale of the second Trio,\r\n     changed to 2-4. Here the new compositions of Beethoven, so far\r\n     as was feasible, were first performed. Here there were generally\r\n     present several great musicians and music-lovers. I, too, as long\r\n     as I lived in Vienna, was present, if not every time, at least\r\n     most of the time.\r\n\r\n     Here a Hungarian count once placed a difficult composition by\r\n     Bach in manuscript before him which he played _a vista_ exactly\r\n     as Bach would have played it, according to the testimony of\r\n     the owner. Here the Viennese author Förster once brought him a\r\n     quartet of which he had made a clean copy only that morning. In\r\n     the second portion of the first movement the violoncello got\r\n     out. Beethoven stood up, and still playing his own part sang the\r\n     bass accompaniment. When I spoke about it to him as a proof of\r\n     extraordinary acquirements, he replied with a smile: “The bass\r\n     part _had_ to be so, else the author would have known nothing\r\n     about composition.” To the remark that he had played a _presto_\r\n     which he had never seen before so rapidly that it must have been\r\n     impossible to see the individual notes, he answered: “Nor is\r\n     that necessary; if you read rapidly there may be a multitude of\r\n     typographical errors, but you neither see nor give heed to them,\r\n     so long as the language is a familiar one.”\r\n\r\n     After the concert the musicians generally stayed to dine. Here\r\n     there gathered, in addition, artists and savants without regard to\r\n     social position. The Princess Christiane was the highly cultivated\r\n     daughter of Count Franz Joseph von Thun, who, a very philanthropic\r\n     and respectable gentleman, was disposed to extravagant enthusiasm\r\n     by his intercourse with Lavater, and believed himself capable of\r\n     healing diseases through the power of his right hand.\r\n\r\nThe following undated letter also belongs to the years of Beethoven’s\r\nintimate association with Wegeler in Vienna (1794-96). It is\r\nsignificant of Beethoven’s character. Though easily offended and prone\r\nto anger, no sooner was the first ebullition of temper past than he was\r\nso reconciliatory and open to explanation that usually his contrition\r\nwas out of all proportion to his fault. For this reason, and because\r\nit presents the friend in a light which provoked a protest from his\r\nmodesty, Wegeler was unwilling to make public the entire letter.[71]\r\n\r\nCONFESSION, CONTRITION, PETITION\r\n\r\n     Dearest! Best! In what an odious light you have exhibited me to\r\n     myself! I acknowledge it, I do not deserve your friendship. You\r\n     are so noble, so considerate, and the first time that I ranged\r\n     myself alongside of you I fell so far below you! Ah, for weeks\r\n     I have displeased my best and noblest friend! You think that I\r\n     have lost some of my goodness of heart, but, thank Heaven! it was\r\n     no intentional or deliberate malice which induced me to act as I\r\n     did towards you; it was my inexcusable thoughtlessness which did\r\n     not permit me to see the matter in its true light. O, how ashamed\r\n     I am, not only for your sake but also my own. I can scarcely\r\n     trust myself to ask for your friendship again. Oh, Wegeler, my\r\n     only comfort lies in this, that you have known me almost from my\r\n     childhood, and yet, O let me say for myself, I was always good,\r\n     and always strove to be upright and true in my actions--otherwise\r\n     how could you have loved me? Could I have changed so fearfully\r\n     for the worse in such a short time? Impossible; these feelings\r\n     of goodness and love of righteousness cannot have died forever\r\n     in me in a moment. No, Wegeler, dearest, best, O, venture again\r\n     to throw yourself entirely into the arms of your B.; trust in\r\n     the good qualities you used to find in him; I will guarantee\r\n     that the pure temple of sacred friendship which you erect shall\r\n     remain firm forever; no accident, no storm shall ever shake its\r\n     foundations--firm--forever--our friendship--pardon--oblivion--a\r\n     new upflaming of the dying, sinking friendship--O, Wegeler, do\r\n     not reject this hand of reconciliation. Place yours in mine--O,\r\n     God!--but no more; I am coming to throw myself in your arms, to\r\n     entreat you to restore to me my lost friend. And you will give\r\n     yourself to me, your penitent, loving, never-forgetting\r\n\r\n    Beethoven again.\r\n\r\n     It was only now that I received your letter, because I have just\r\n     returned home.\r\n\r\nIn this connection Wegeler comes to speak of the outward conditions of\r\nBeethoven: “Beethoven,” he says on page 33,\r\n\r\n     brought up under extremely restricted circumstances, and as it\r\n     were, under guardianship, though that of his friends, did not\r\n     know the value of money and was anything but economical. Thus,\r\n     to cite a single instance, the Prince’s dinner hour was fixed at\r\n     4 o’clock. “Now,” said Beethoven, “it is desired that every day\r\n     I shall be at home at half-past 3, put on better clothes, care\r\n     for my beard, etc.--I can’t stand that!” So it happened that he\r\n     frequently went to the taverns, since, as has been said, in this\r\n     as in all other matters of economy, he knew nothing about the\r\n     value of things or of money. The Prince, Wegeler continues, who\r\n     had a loud, metallic voice, once directed his serving-man that if\r\n     ever he and Beethoven should ring at the same time the latter was\r\n     to be first served. Beethoven heard this, and the same day engaged\r\n     a servant for himself. In the same manner, once when he took a\r\n     whim to learn to ride, which speedily left him, the stable of the\r\n     Prince being offered him, he bought a horse.\r\n\r\nConcerning his friend’s affairs of the heart, Wegeler had opportunity\r\nto make observations in Vienna. He relates on page 43 that while he was\r\nin the capital Beethoven “was always in love and made many conquests\r\nwhich would have been difficult if not impossible for many an Adonis.”\r\nBeethoven’s antipathy to teaching before he left Bonn has already been\r\nnoticed. In Vienna he developed a still stronger repugnance to playing\r\nin society when requested to do so. He often complained to Wegeler how\r\ngrievously this put him out of sorts, whereupon the latter sought to\r\nentertain him and quiet him by conversation. “When this purpose was\r\nreached,” he continues,\r\n\r\n     I dropped the conversation, seated myself at the writing table,\r\n     and Beethoven, if he wanted to continue the discourse, had to\r\n     sit down on the chair before the pianoforte. Soon, still turned\r\n     away from the instrument, he aimlessly struck a few chords out of\r\n     which gradually grew the most beautiful melodies. Oh, why did I\r\n     not understand more of music! Several times I put ruled paper upon\r\n     the desk as if without intention, in order to get a manuscript\r\n     of his; he wrote upon it but then folded it up and put it in his\r\n     pocket! Concerning his playing I was permitted to say but little,\r\n     and that only in passing. He would then go away entirely changed\r\n     in mood and always come back again gladly. The antipathy remained,\r\n     however, and was frequently the cause of differences between\r\n     Beethoven and his friends and well-wishers.\r\n\r\nOLD BONN FRIENDS REMEMBERED\r\n\r\nThere is still one other reminiscence of Wegeler in the appendix to the\r\n“Notizen” (page 9) worthy of citation. “At one time private lectures\r\nwere given in Vienna on Kant, which had been arranged by Adam Schmidt,\r\nWilhelm Schmidt, Hunczovsky, Göpfert and others. In spite of my urgings\r\nBeethoven refused to attend a single one of them.” There is no\r\nreference in Wegeler’s “Notizen” to instruction received by Beethoven\r\nfrom Albrechtsberger. With his old colleague in the Court Orchestra\r\nin Bonn, Nicolaus Simrock, though he was a much older man, Beethoven\r\nremained in touch after his removal to Vienna. Simrock, who was highly\r\nesteemed both as man and musician, had embarked in business as a\r\nmusic publisher in Bonn. The Variations on a theme from Dittersdorf’s\r\n“Rothkäppchen,” were published by him (at the latest in the early\r\npart of 1794), as well as those for pianoforte four hands on a theme\r\nby Count Waldstein (some time in the same year). It is to the latter\r\ncomposition that the following letter refers:\r\n\r\n    Vienna, August 2, 1794.\r\n\r\n    Dear Simrock:\r\n\r\n     I deserve a little scolding from you for holding back your\r\n     Variations so long, but, indeed, I do not lie when I say that I\r\n     was hindered from correcting them sooner by an overwhelming amount\r\n     of business. You will note the shortcomings for yourself, but I\r\n     must wish you joy on the appearance of your engraving, which is\r\n     beautiful, clear and legible. Verily, if you keep on thus you\r\n     will become chief among cutters, that is, note cutters[72]. In my\r\n     former letter I promised to send you something of mine and you\r\n     interpreted the remark as being in the language of the cavaliers.\r\n     How have I deserved such a title? Faugh! who would indulge in such\r\n     language in these democratic days of ours? To free myself from the\r\n     imputation as soon as I have finished the grand revision of my\r\n     compositions, which will be soon, you shall have something which\r\n     you will surely engrave. I have also been looking about me for a\r\n     commissioner and have found a right capable young fellow for the\r\n     place. His name is Traeg. You have naught to do but to write to\r\n     him or me about the conditions which you want to make. He asks of\r\n     you one-third _rabate_. The devil take all such bargaining! It is\r\n     very hot here. The Viennese fear that they will soon be unable to\r\n     eat ice-cream, there having been little cold last winter and ice\r\n     being scarce. Many persons of importance have come here and it\r\n     was said that a revolution was imminent; but it is my belief that\r\n     so long as the Austrian has his dark beer and sausage he will not\r\n     revolt. It is said that the suburban gates are to be closed at ten\r\n     o’clock at night. The soldiers’ guns are loaded with bullets. No\r\n     one dares speak aloud for fear of arrest by the police. Are your\r\n     daughters grown? Bring one up to be my wife, for if I am to remain\r\n     single in Bonn I shall not stay long, of a surety. You also must\r\n     be living in fear. How is good Ries? I shall write to him soon for\r\n     he can have only an unfavorable opinion of me--but this damned\r\n     writing! I cannot get over my antipathy towards it. Have you\r\n     performed my piece yet? Write to me occasionally.\r\n\r\n     Please send also a few copies of the first Variations.\r\n\r\n    Your\r\n    Beethoven.\r\n\r\nThese “first Variations” obviously are those on the theme from\r\n“Rothkäppchen”; those referred to in the early part of the letter\r\nthe ones on Count Waldstein’s theme. The “piece” whose performance\r\nhe inquires about is the Octet, and the allusion to it justifies the\r\nbelief that it was composed for the wind-instrument players of Bonn who\r\nfound no opportunity to play it while Beethoven was still in his native\r\ncity. The letter, like that written to Eleonore von Breuning, shows\r\nthat Beethoven was still thinking of the possibility or probability of\r\na return to Bonn. Its cheerful tone discloses a comfortable, satisfied\r\nframe of mind--the mood from which the first Trios proceeded.\r\n\r\nFIRST CONCERT APPEARANCES IN VIENNA\r\n\r\nWe return to the chronological record of events. The first of these in\r\nthe year 1795, was Beethoven’s first appearance in public as virtuoso\r\nand composer. The annual concerts in the Burgtheater established by\r\nGassmann for the benefit of the widows of the Tonkünstlergesellschaft\r\nwere announced for the evenings of March 29 and 30. The vocal work\r\nselected for performance was an oratorio in two parts, “Gioas, Re\r\ndi Giuda,” by Antonio Cartellieri; the instrumental, a Concerto for\r\nPianoforte and Orchestra, composed and played by Ludwig van Beethoven.\r\nCartellieri was a young man of twenty-three years (born in Danzig,\r\nSeptember 27, 1772) who, a year or two since, had come from Berlin\r\nto study operatic composition with the then greatest living composer\r\nin that field, Salieri. As the direction of these Widow and Orphan\r\nconcerts was almost exclusively in the hands of Salieri, one is\r\nalmost tempted to think that he may on this occasion have indulged a\r\npardonable vanity in bringing forward two of his pupils, if we did not\r\nknow how strong an attraction the name of Beethoven must have been for\r\nthe public which, as yet, had had no opportunity to learn his great\r\npowers except by report. The day of the performance drew near but the\r\nConcerto was not yet written out. “Not until the afternoon of the\r\nsecond day before the concert did he write the rondo, and then while\r\nsuffering from a pretty severe colic which frequently afflicted him.\r\nI [Wegeler] relieved him with simple remedies so far as I could. In\r\nthe anteroom sat four copyists to whom he handed sheet after sheet\r\nas soon as it was finished.... At the first rehearsal, which took\r\nplace the next day in Beethoven’s room, the pianoforte was found to\r\nbe half a tone lower than the wind-instruments. Without a moment’s\r\ndelay Beethoven had the wind-instruments and the others tune to\r\nB-flat instead of A and played his part in C-sharp.” Thus Wegeler in\r\nhis “Notizen” (pg. 36). But he has confounded two compositions. The\r\nconcerto which Beethoven played on March 29, 1795, was not that in C\r\n(Op. 15) which was not yet finished, but, in all probability, that in\r\nB-flat (Op. 19). For the fact that the Concerto in B-flat was composed\r\nbefore that in C we have the testimony of Beethoven himself, who wrote\r\nto Breitkopf and Härtel on April 22, 1801: “I simply want to call your\r\nattention to the fact that one of my first Concertos will be published\r\nby Hoffmeister, which is not among my best works, and one also by\r\nMollo which, though composed later, etc.” The Concerto in B-flat was\r\npublished in 1801 by Hoffmeister and that in C in the same year by\r\nMollo and Co. in Vienna, the latter a little in advance of the former,\r\nwherefore there need be no surprise at the earlier _opus_ number.\r\n\r\nBeethoven also took part in the second concert on March 30, the\r\nminutes of the Tonkünstlerschaft recording that he “improvised on the\r\npianoforte”; and though busily engaged he also embraced an opportunity\r\nto testify to his devotion to the manes of Mozart. On March 31, 1795,\r\nMozart’s widow arranged a performance of “La Clemenza di Tito” in the\r\nBurgtheater. “After the first part,” says the advertisement, “Mr.\r\nLudwig van Beethoven will play a Concerto of Mozart’s composition on\r\nthe Pianoforte.” We opine that this concerto was Mozart’s in D minor,\r\nwhich Beethoven loved especially and for which he wrote cadenzas.\r\n\r\nThe Trios, Op. 1, had now become so well known and appreciated in\r\nmusical circles as to justify their publication, and accordingly, an\r\nadvertisement inviting subscriptions for Ludwig van Beethoven’s “three\r\nGrand Trios” appeared in the “Wiener Zeitung” on May 16, 1795. Three\r\ndays later a contract was signed by the author and Artaria and Company.\r\nThe printed list of subscribers gives 123 names, mostly belonging\r\nto the higher circles, with subscriptions amounting to 241 copies.\r\nAs Beethoven paid the publisher but one florin per copy, and the\r\nsubscription price was one ducat, he made a handsome profit out of the\r\ntransaction.[73]\r\n\r\nFIRST PIANOFORTE TRIOS AND SONATAS\r\n\r\nWe must tarry a moment longer with these Trios. That the author is\r\ndisposed to place their origin in the Bonn period has already appeared.\r\nArgument in favor of this view can be found in the fact of their\r\nearly performance in Vienna, for there can be no reasonable question\r\nof the correctness of Ries’s story, for which Beethoven himself was\r\nauthority, that they were played at the house of Prince Lichnowsky, in\r\nthe presence of Haydn. This performance must have taken place before\r\nJanuary 19, 1794, because on that day Haydn started again for England.\r\nNow, Beethoven’s sketches show that he was still working on at least\r\nthe second and third of the Trios after 1794, and that they were not\r\nready for the printer before the end of that year. Further explanation\r\nis offered by the following little circumstances: since Haydn was\r\npresent, the performance at Prince Lichnowsky’s must have been from\r\nmanuscript. In the morning meeting which probably took place only a\r\nshort time before the soirée, Beethoven’s attention was called to the\r\ndesirability of changing in the last movement of the second Trio, the\r\ntime-signature from 4-4 to 2-4. Beethoven made the change. From these\r\nfacts it may be concluded that after a first there was a final revision\r\nof these Trios and that the former version disappeared or was destroyed\r\nafter the latter was made. It has repeatedly been intimated that\r\nthe author believes that the rewriting of compositions completed in\r\nBeethoven’s early period is farther-reaching than is generally assumed.\r\nThe case therefore seems to present itself as follows: Haydn heard the\r\nTrios at Lichnowsky’s in their first state; Beethoven then took them\r\nup for revision and in the course of 1794 and the beginning of 1795\r\nbrought them to the state in which we know them. It is not possible to\r\nsay positively whether or not the first form, particularly of the first\r\nTrio, dates back to the Bonn period.\r\n\r\nAn interesting anecdote connected with these Trios may well find place\r\nhere; it is contributed by Madame Mary de Fouche, daughter of Tomkison,\r\nwho, in the seventh decade of the nineteenth century, was one of the\r\nmore famous pianoforte manufacturers of London: In the early days of\r\nthe century, a little society of musicians--J. B. Cramer, the pianist;\r\nF. Cramer, violinist, half-brother of the preceding; J. P. Salomon,\r\nwhose name has so often come up in previous chapters of this work;\r\nBridgetower, a mulatto and celebrated violinist, whose name we shall\r\nmeet again; Watts, tenor; Morant, also tenor, who married the great\r\nDussek’s widow; Dahmen, Lindley and Crossdale, violoncellists--was\r\nin the habit of meeting regularly at Mr. Tomkison’s to try over and\r\ncriticise such new music of the German school as came to the London\r\ndealers. At one of these meetings the new Trios of Beethoven, Op. 1,\r\nwere played through, J. B. Cramer at the pianoforte. “This is the man,”\r\nhe cried, “who is to console us for the loss of Mozart!” According to\r\nthe recollection of Cipriani Potter, this was after Cramer had made the\r\npersonal acquaintance of Beethoven in Vienna, and had heard him play\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nSome other incidents recorded by Wegeler belong to this year. Haydn\r\nreached Vienna upon his return from his second visit to England on\r\nAugust 20. Beethoven had now ready the three Sonatas, Op. 2, and at one\r\nof the Friday morning concerts at Prince Lichnowsky’s he played them\r\nto Haydn, to whom they were dedicated.\r\n\r\n     Here (says Wegeler on page 29 of the ‘Notizen’), Count Appony\r\n     asked Beethoven to compose a quartet for him for a given\r\n     compensation, Beethoven not yet having written a piece in this\r\n     genre. The Count declared that contrary to custom he did not want\r\n     to have exclusive possession of the quartet for half a year before\r\n     publication, nor did he ask that it be dedicated to him, etc. In\r\n     response to repeated urgings by me, Beethoven twice set about the\r\n     task, but the first effort resulted in a grand violin Trio (Op.\r\n     3), the second in a violin Quintet (Op. 4).\r\n\r\nHow much mistaken Wegeler was in these concluding statements has\r\nalready been indicated.\r\n\r\nThe three Pianoforte Sonatas dedicated to Haydn were, therefore, the\r\nsecond group of compositions which Beethoven considered illustrative of\r\nhis artistic ideals and worthy of publication. Nothing can be said with\r\npositiveness touching the time of their origin. Schönfeld’s words in\r\nhis “Jahrbuch der Tonkunst von Wien und Prag”: “We already have several\r\nof his Sonatas, among which his last are particularly noteworthy,”\r\nwhich were written at least eight months before the Sonatas appeared\r\nin print, lead to the conclusion that the Sonatas were known in Vienna\r\nin manuscript in the spring of 1795. Their appearance in print was\r\nannounced in the “Wiener Zeitung” of March 9, 1796.\r\n\r\nStill another anecdote recorded by Wegeler refers to another\r\ncomposition of this period: “Beethoven was seated in a box at the opera\r\nwith a lady of whom he thought much at a performance of ‘La Molinara.’\r\nWhen the familiar _Nel cor più non mi sento_ was reached the lady\r\nremarked that she had possessed some variations on the theme but had\r\nlost them. In the same night Beethoven wrote the six variations on the\r\nmelody and the next morning sent them to the lady with the inscription:\r\n_Variazioni, etc., Perdute par la--ritrovate par Luigi van Beethoven_.\r\nThey are so easy that it is likely Beethoven wished that she should be\r\nable to play them at sight.” Paisiello’s “La Molinara,” composed in\r\n1788 for Naples, was performed on March 8, 1794 in the Court Opera, and\r\nagain on June 24 and 27, 1795, in the Kärnthnerthor-Theater in Vienna.\r\nConsidering the time of the publication of these unpretentious but\r\ngenial little variations, their composition may be set down after the\r\nlatter performances. At the same period Beethoven wrote variations on\r\nanother theme (_Quant’ è più bello_) from the same opera, which were\r\npublished before the former and dedicated to Prince Carl Lichnowsky.\r\nIt is likely that a few more sets of variations, a form of composition\r\nfor which Beethoven had a strong predilection at the time, had\r\ntheir origin in these early years of Beethoven’s life in Vienna. The\r\nVariations in C on the “Menuet à la Vigano” from the ballet “Le Nozze\r\ndisturbate,” may confidently be assigned to the year 1795. The ballet\r\nwas performed for the first time on May 18, 1795, at Schikaneder’s\r\ntheatre; the Variations are advertised as published on February 27,\r\n1796.\r\n\r\nThe Gesellschaft der bildenden Künstler had, in the year 1792,\r\nestablished an annual ball in the Redoutensaal in the month of\r\nNovember; and Haydn, just then returned covered with glory from\r\nEngland, composed a set of twelve minuets and twelve German dances for\r\nthe occasion. In 1793, the Royal Imperial Composer Kozeluch followed\r\nHaydn’s example. In 1794, Dittersdorf wrote the same number of like\r\ndances for the large hall, and Eybler for the small. In view of this\r\narray of great names, and considering that as yet the Trios, Op.\r\n1, were the only works of a higher order than the Variations which\r\nBeethoven had sent to press, the advertisements for the annual ball\r\nto be given upon the 22nd of November, 1795, give a vivid proof of\r\nthe high reputation which the young man had gained as a composer now\r\nat the end of his third year in Vienna. These advertisements conclude\r\nthus: “The music for the Minuets and German dances for this ball is\r\nan entirely new arrangement. For the larger room they were written by\r\nthe Royal Imperial Chapelmaster Süssmayr; for the smaller room by the\r\nmaster hand of Mr. Ludwig van Beethoven out of love for the artistic\r\nfraternity.” These dances, arranged for pianoforte by Beethoven\r\nhimself, came from the press of Artaria a few weeks later, as did also\r\nSüssmayr’s; Beethoven’s name in the advertisement being in large and\r\nconspicuous type.\r\n\r\nAs the year began with the first, so it closed with Beethoven’s\r\nsecond appearance in public as composer and virtuoso; and here is the\r\nadvertisement of the performance from the “Wiener Zeitung” of December\r\n16:\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN PAYS TRIBUTE TO HAYDN\r\n\r\n     Next Friday, the 18th instant, Mr. the Chapelmaster Haydn will\r\n     give a grand musical concert in the small Redoutensaal, at which\r\n     Mad. Tomeoni and Mr. Mombelli will sing. Mr. van Beethoven will\r\n     play a Concerto of his composing on the Pianoforte, and three\r\n     grand symphonies, not yet heard here, which the Chapelmaster\r\n     composed during his last sojourn in London, will be performed.\r\n\r\nOne would gladly know what concerto was played.[74] But there was\r\nlittle public criticism then outside of London and very rarely any\r\nin Vienna. The mere fact of the appearance of Beethoven at his old\r\nmaster’s concert is, however, another proof that too much stress has\r\nbeen laid upon a hasty word spoken by him to Ries. Haydn wanted that\r\nBeethoven should put “Pupil of Haydn” on the title-page of his first\r\nworks. Beethoven was unwilling to do so because, as he said, “though he\r\nhad taken some lessons from Haydn he had never learned anything from\r\nhim.” Nothing could be more natural than for Haydn, knowing nothing\r\nof the studies of his pupil with Schenk, to express such a wish in\r\nrelation to the Sonatas dedicated to him, and equally natural that the\r\nauthor should refuse; but to add to the attractions of the concert was\r\na very different matter--a graceful and delicate compliment which he\r\ncould with pleasure make.\r\n\r\nThis chapter may appropriately close with the one important family\r\nevent of this year. The father, the mother, two infant brothers and two\r\ninfant sisters slept in the churchyard at Bonn; but Ludwig, Caspar and\r\nJohann were never more to look upon their graves. The three brothers\r\nwere now reunited. Vienna had become their new home and not one of them\r\nbeheld the rushing Rhine again.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[70] Though Thayer fixed the date of this letter in May or June, 1794,\r\nDr. Deiters believed that it was of a much earlier date; and may,\r\nindeed, have been written before Beethoven went to Vienna. For his\r\ntheory Dr. Deiters found a plausible argument in the spelling of the\r\nname with a “w” instead of a “v,” and the reiterated references to a\r\nmisunderstanding which had long been made right. The letter has no date\r\nor superscription and Wegeler assumed that it was the continuation\r\nof one whose first page had been lost. If the letter was written in\r\nBonn it would prove that the Rondo (probably that in G for Pianoforte\r\nand Violin, B. and H. Series XII, No. 102) was composed before the\r\nbeginning of the Viennese period; which might well be. The Sonata is\r\nprobably the unfinished one in C, dedicated to Eleonore von Breuning.\r\n\r\n[71] This was done by Wegeler’s grandson, Carl Wegeler, in an essay\r\npublished in the “Coblenz Zeitung” on May 20, 1890.\r\n\r\n[72] An early example of Beethoven’s fondness for punning. _Stechen_\r\nmeans many things in German--among them to sting, stab, tilt in a\r\ntournament, take a trick at cards--as well as to engrave, or cut in\r\nmetal.\r\n\r\n[73] The son of Artaria told Nohl that his father had told him that he\r\ngot the money to pay Beethoven without the composer’s knowledge from\r\nPrince Lichnowsky.\r\n\r\n[74] It was probably that in B-flat. See Nottebohm’s “Zweite\r\nBeethoveniana,” page 72.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV\r\n\r\n     The Years 1796 and 1797--Beethoven in Prague and Berlin--King\r\n     Frederick William II and Prince Louis Ferdinand--Himmel, Fasch and\r\n     Zelter--Compositions and Publications.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe narrative resumes its course with the year 1796, the twenty-sixth\r\nof Beethoven’s life and his fourth in Vienna. If not yet officially,\r\nhe was _de facto_ discharged from his obligations to the Elector\r\nMaximilian and all his relations with Bonn and its people were broken\r\noff. Vienna had become his home, and there is no reason to suppose that\r\nhe ever afterwards cherished any real and settled purpose to exchange\r\nit for another--not even in 1809 when, for the moment, he had some\r\nthought of accepting Jerome Bonaparte’s invitation to Cassel.\r\n\r\nHe had now entered his course of contrapuntal study with\r\nAlbrechtsberger; he was first of the pianoforte players of the capital\r\nand his name added attraction even to the concert which Haydn,\r\nreturning again from his London triumphs, had given to introduce\r\nsome of his new works to the Viennese; his “master-hand” was already\r\npublicly recognized in the field of musical composition; he counted\r\nmany nobles of the higher ranks in his list of personal friends and\r\nhad been, perhaps even now was, a member of Prince Carl Lichnowsky’s\r\nfamily. The change in his pecuniary condition might have thrown a more\r\nequitable temperament than his off its balance. Three years ago he\r\nanxiously noted down the few kreutzers occasionally spent for coffee\r\nor chocolate “für Haidn und mich”; now he keeps his own servant and a\r\nhorse. His brothers, if at all a burden, were no longer a heavy one.\r\nCarl Caspar, according to the best information now obtainable, soon\r\ngained moderate success in the musical profession and, with probably\r\nsome occasional aid from Ludwig both pecuniary and in obtaining pupils,\r\nearned sufficient for his comfortable support; while Johann had secured\r\na situation in that apothecary shop “Zum Heiligen Geist” which, in\r\n1860, was still to be seen in the Kärnthnerstrasse near the former\r\nsite of the gate of that name.[75] His wages were, of course, small and\r\nwe shall soon see that Ludwig offers him assistance if needed, though\r\nnot to Karl; but Johann’s position gradually improved and he was able\r\nin a few years to save enough to enable him, unaided by his brother, to\r\npurchase and establish himself in a business of his own.[76]\r\n\r\n“Fate had become propitious to Beethoven”; and a final citation from\r\nthe memorandum book will show in what spirit he was determined to\r\nmerit the continuance of Fortune’s favor. If we make allowance for the\r\nold error as to his real age, this citation may belong to a period a\r\nyear or two later; but may it not be one of those extracts from books\r\nand periodical publications which all his life long he was so fond of\r\nmaking? This seems to be the more probable supposition. The words are\r\nthese: “Courage! In spite of all bodily weaknesses my spirit shall\r\nrule. You have lived 25 years. This year must determine the complete\r\nman. Nothing must remain undone.”\r\n\r\nAnd now let the chronological narrative of events be resumed. As the\r\nyear 1795 had ended with a public appearance of Beethoven as pianoforte\r\nplayer and composer, so also began the year 1796; and, as on a former\r\noccasion in a concert by Haydn, so this time he played at a concert\r\ngiven by a singer, Signora Bolla, who afterward became famous, in the\r\nRedoutensaal. Again he played a pianoforte concerto.\r\n\r\nMEETING OF FRIENDS IN NUREMBERG\r\n\r\n“In 1796,” says Wegeler (“Nachträge,” p. 18), “the two older Breuning\r\nbrothers, Christoph and Stephan, find him (Beethoven) at Nuremberg\r\non a return journey to Vienna. Which journey is not specified. None\r\nof the three having a passport from Vienna they were all detained at\r\nLinz, but soon liberated through my intervention at Vienna.” And from\r\na letter written by Stephan von Breuning to his mother, dated January,\r\n1796, Wegeler quotes: “From Nuremberg, Beethoven travelled all the way\r\nin company with us. The three Bonnians thus attracted the attention\r\nof the police, who thought they had made a wonderful discovery. I do\r\nnot believe that there could be a less dangerous man than Beethoven.”\r\nWegeler’s suggestion that Beethoven was returning “perhaps from Berlin”\r\nis of course out of the question. But between the date of Haydn’s\r\nconcert (December 18th) and Stephan von Breuning’s letter, if written\r\ntowards the end of January, there was ample time, even in those days of\r\npost-coaches, for a journey to Prague and thence across the country\r\nto Mergentheim or Ellingen, at that time the temporary residences of\r\nElector Maximilian. The necessity of Beethoven’s knowing precisely in\r\nwhat relation he was to stand with the Elector in the future, accounts\r\nsufficiently for his being in Nuremberg at that time, especially if\r\nhe had had occasion to visit Prague during the Christmas holidays,\r\nwhich is not improbable. Dlabacz, in his “Künstler-Lexikon,” has a\r\nparagraph of which this is a part: “v. Beethoven, a Concertmaster on\r\nthe pianoforte. In the year 1795, he gave an academy in Prague at\r\nwhich he played with universal approval.” It is true that Dlabacz may\r\nhere record a concert given during Beethoven’s stay in the Bohemian\r\ncapital some weeks later; but, on the one hand, no other notice of\r\nsuch a concert has been discovered; and, on the other, the “universal\r\napproval” on this occasion may have been an inducement for him to\r\nreturn thither so soon.\r\n\r\nAt all events, his delay in Vienna after coming from Nuremberg was\r\nshort and was doubtless occupied with the last corrections of the\r\nSonatas, Op. 2, dedicated to Haydn, the six Menuets (second part), the\r\nVariations on the theme from “Le Nozze disturbate” and those on “Nel\r\ncor più non mi sento,” all of which works are advertised in the “Wiener\r\nZeitung” in the course of the next two months, while their author was\r\nagain in Prague or cities farther North. For the following letter we\r\nare indebted to Madame van Beethoven, widow of the composer’s nephew,\r\nCarl:\r\n\r\n     To my brother Nicholaus Beethoven\r\n\r\n     to be delivered at the apothecary shop at the Kärnthner Thor Mr.\r\n     von Z.[77] will please hand this letter to the wig-maker who will\r\n     care for its delivery.\r\n\r\n    Prague, February 19th (1796).\r\n\r\n    Dear Brother!\r\n\r\n     So that you may at least know where I am and what I am doing\r\n     I must needs write you. In the first place I am getting on\r\n     well--very well. My art wins for me friends and respect; what more\r\n     do I want? This time, too, I shall earn considerable money. I\r\n     shall remain here a few weeks more and then go to Dresden, Leipsic\r\n     and Berlin. It will probably be six weeks before I shall return. I\r\n     hope that you will be more and more pleased with your sojourn in\r\n     Vienna; but beware of the whole guild of wicked women. Have you\r\n     yet called on Cousin Elss? You might write to me at this place if\r\n     you have inclination and time.\r\n\r\n     F. Linowsky will probably soon return to Vienna; he has already\r\n     gone from here. If you need money you may go to him boldly, for he\r\n     still owes me some.\r\n\r\n     For the rest I hope that your life will grow continually in\r\n     happiness and to that end I hope to contribute something.\r\n     Farewell, dear brother, and think occasionally of\r\n\r\n    Your true, faithful brother\r\n    L. Beethoven.\r\n\r\n    Greetings to Brother Caspar.\r\n    My address is The Golden Unicorn\r\n    on the Kleinseite.\r\n\r\nA debt of gratitude is certainly due Johann van Beethoven for having\r\ncarefully preserved this letter for full half a century and leaving it\r\nto his heirs, notwithstanding all the troubles which afterwards arose\r\nbetween the brothers, since it is hardly more valuable and interesting\r\nfor the facts which it states directly than for what it indicates and\r\nsuggests more or less clearly.\r\n\r\nA SOJOURN IN PRAGUE AND ITS FRUITS\r\n\r\nIt, with other considerations, render it well nigh certain that\r\nBeethoven had now come to Prague with Prince Lichnowsky as Mozart had\r\ndone, seven years before, and that upon leaving Vienna he had had\r\nno intention of pursuing his journey farther; but encouraged by the\r\nsuccess thus reported to his brother, he suddenly determined to seek\r\ninstruction and experience, pleasure, profit and fame in an extended\r\ntour. Had he projected this journey already in Vienna, how could all\r\nrecollection of it have been lost by Wegeler? How could von Breuning\r\nin the letter cited above have omitted all mention of it? Nor is it\r\npossible to think that Beethoven, still so young and still so unknown\r\noutside the Austrian and Bohemian capitals, having so many powerful and\r\ninfluential friends there, and there only, could at this time have gone\r\nforth to seek elsewhere some permanent position with a fixed salary.\r\nThe remarks which have been preserved, made by him in writing or\r\nconversation, expressing a desire for such an appointment, all belong\r\nto a later period, and cannot by any torture of language be made to\r\nrefer to this, when he was looking into the future with well-grounded\r\nhopes and serene confidence of advancement in his new home. Vienna\r\nseemed to offer him all his ambition could crave; why should he seek\r\nhis fortune beyond her walls?\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to note his care for the welfare of his brother Johann,\r\nwhich care, doubtless, the other brother did not need. But how could\r\nPrince Lichnowsky have been indebted to Ludwig?\r\n\r\nThe musical public of Prague was the same that had so recently honored\r\nitself by its instant and noble appreciation of Mozart, and had given\r\nso glorious a welcome to “Figaro,” “Don Giovanni” and “Titus.” There\r\nbeing no royal or imperial court there, and the public amusements being\r\nless numerous than in Vienna, the nobility were thrown more on their\r\nown resources for recreation; and hence, besides the traditional taste\r\nof the Bohemians for instrumental music, their capital was, perhaps,\r\na better field for the virtuoso than Vienna. No notice of any public\r\nconcert given by Beethoven on this visit has been discovered, either in\r\nthe newspapers of the time or in the reminiscences of Thomaschek and\r\nothers; and “the considerable money” earned “this time” must have been\r\nthe presents of the nobility for his performances in their salons, and,\r\nperhaps, for compositions.\r\n\r\nThe conception of the aria “Ah, perfido! spergiuro” is generally\r\nassociated with Beethoven’s sojourn in Prague. The belief rests upon\r\nthe fact that upon the cover of a copy which he revised Beethoven\r\nwrote the words “Une grande Scène mise en musique par L. v. Beethoven\r\nà Prague, 1796.” On the first page is written: _Recitativo e Aria\r\ncomposta e dedicata alla Signora Contessa di Clari da L. v. Beethoven_.\r\nThe opus number, 46, in this title is in the handwriting of Al. Fuchs,\r\nwho owned a copy. Now, on November 21st, 1796, Madame Duschek, the well\r\nknown friend of Mozart, at a concert in Leipsic sang “An Italian Scena\r\ncomposed for Madame Duschek by Beethoven,” and it was easy to conclude\r\nthat the aria was really written by Beethoven for Madame Duschek. On a\r\npage of sketches preserved in Berlin among others there are sketches\r\nbelonging to “Ah, perfido!” which do not agree with the printed page.\r\nOn the lower margin of the first page is the remark: _pour Mademoiselle\r\nla Comtesse de Clari_. Nottebohm is led by these things to surmise that\r\nthe aria was written in Vienna in 1795, before the visit to Prague.\r\nIn any case, we are permitted to associate the date 1796 only with\r\nthe completion of the work in Prague; and the purpose may well have\r\nbeen to have it sung by Madame Duschek, who is thus proved to have\r\nbelonged to the circle of Beethoven’s friends in Prague. Nevertheless,\r\nthe aria was originally intended for the Countess Josephine Clari, a\r\nwell known amateur singer who married Count Christian Clam-Gallas in\r\n1797. The scena first appeared in print in the fall of 1805, when it\r\nwas published in a collection made by Hoffmeister and Kühnel. Beethoven\r\nplaced it upon the programme of his concert in 1808.\r\n\r\nAnother family in which Beethoven was received on the footing of a\r\nfriend was that of Appellate Councillor Kanka. Both father and son\r\nwere dilettante composers and instrumental players--the father on the\r\nvioloncello, the son on the pianoforte. Gerber gives them a place\r\nin his Lexicon. “Miss Jeanette” (the daughter), says the eulogistic\r\nSchönfeld, “played the pianoforte with great expression and skill.” The\r\nson adopted his father’s profession, became a distinguished writer on\r\nBohemian law, and in later years did Beethoven good service as legal\r\nadviser.\r\n\r\nThere is in the Artaria collection, a thick fascicle of sketches and\r\nmusical fragments from Beethoven’s hand in which papers from the Bonn\r\nperiod down to the close of the century are stitched together in such\r\ndisorder as to show that they were thus joined merely for preservation.\r\nOne sheet of mere sketches bears, if correctly deciphered, this\r\ninscription: “Written and dedicated to Gr. C. G. as a souvenir of his\r\nstay in P.” On the fourth page of the sheet stands “these 4 Bagtalles\r\nby B.” with something more illegible. May not some yet unknown\r\ncomposition of Beethoven be still in the possession of the family\r\nClam-Gallas? Count Christian and his two daughters are numbered by\r\nSchönfeld among the fine pianoforte players of Prague, and these few\r\nnotices exhaust the information obtained upon this visit of Beethoven\r\nthere. His next appearance is in Berlin. No record has been found of\r\nthe proposed visit to either Dresden or Leipsic, although his journey,\r\nit would seem, must have taken him through the Saxon capital.\r\n\r\nINCIDENTS OF A VISIT TO BERLIN\r\n\r\nIn after years he was fond of talking about his sojourn in Berlin, and\r\nsome particulars have thus been preserved. “He played,” says Ries,\r\n\r\n     several times at court (that of King Frederick William II), where\r\n     he played the two grand sonatas with _obbligato_ violoncello,\r\n     Op. 5, written for Duport, first violoncellist of the King, and\r\n     himself. On his departure he received a gold snuff-box filled\r\n     with Louis d’ors. Beethoven declared with pride that it was not\r\n     an ordinary snuff-box, but such an one as it might have been\r\n     customary to give to an ambassador.\r\n\r\nThis king shared his uncle Frederick II’s love for music, while\r\nhis taste was better and more cultivated. His instrument was the\r\nvioloncello, and he often took part in quartets and sometimes in the\r\nrehearsals of Italian operas. He exerted a powerful and enduring\r\ninfluence for good upon the musical taste of Berlin. It was he\r\nwho caused the operas of Gluck and Mozart to be performed there\r\nand introduced oratorios of Handel into the court concerts. His\r\nappreciation of Mozart’s genius, and his wish to attach that great\r\nmaster to his court, are well known; and these facts render credible a\r\nstatement with which Carl Czerny closes a description of Beethoven’s\r\nextemporaneous playing contributed to Cock’s “London Musical\r\nMiscellany” (August 2nd, 1852):\r\n\r\n     His improvisation was most brilliant and striking. In whatever\r\n     company he might chance to be, he knew how to produce such an\r\n     effect upon every hearer that frequently not an eye remained\r\n     dry, while many would break out into loud sobs; for there was\r\n     something wonderful in his expression in addition to the beauty\r\n     and originality of his ideas and his spirited style of rendering\r\n     them. After ending an improvisation of this kind he would burst\r\n     into loud laughter and banter his hearers on the emotion he had\r\n     caused in them. “You are fools!” he would say. Sometimes he would\r\n     feel himself insulted by these indications of sympathy. “Who can\r\n     live among such spoiled children?” he would cry, and only on\r\n     that account (as he told me) he declined to accept an invitation\r\n     which the King of Prussia gave him after one of the extemporary\r\n     performances above described.\r\n\r\nChapelmaster Reichardt had withdrawn himself from Berlin two years\r\nbefore, having fallen into disfavor because of his sympathy with the\r\nFrench Revolution. Neither Himmel nor Righini, his successors, ever\r\nshowed a genius for chamber music of a high order, and, indeed, there\r\nwas no composer of reputation in this sphere then living in that\r\nquarter. The young Beethoven by his two sonatas had proved his powers\r\nand the King saw in him precisely the right man to fill the vacancy--no\r\nsmall proof of superior taste and judgment. What the German expression\r\nwas which the translator of Czerny’s letter has rendered “accept an\r\ninvitation which the King gave him” there is no means of knowing; but\r\nas it stands it can only mean an invitation to enter permanently into\r\nhis service. The death of the King the next year, of course, prevented\r\nits being ever renewed.\r\n\r\nFriedrich Heinrich Himmel, five years older than Beethoven, whom\r\nthe King had withdrawn from the study of theology and caused to be\r\nthoroughly educated as a musician, first under Naumann in Dresden and\r\nafterwards in Italy, had returned the year before and had assumed his\r\nduties as Royal Pianist and Composer. As a virtuoso on his instrument\r\nhis only rival in Berlin was Prince Louis Ferdinand, son of Prince\r\nAugust and nephew of Frederick II, two years younger than Beethoven and\r\nendowed by nature with talents and genius which would have made him\r\nconspicuous had fortune not given him royal descent. He and Beethoven\r\nbecame well known to each other and each felt and did full justice to\r\nthe other’s musical genius and attainments. Now let Ries speak again:\r\n\r\nMEETINGS WITH HIMMEL, FASCH AND ZELTER\r\n\r\n     In Berlin he (Beethoven) associated much with Himmel, of whom he\r\n     said that he had a pretty talent, but no more; his pianoforte\r\n     playing, he said, was elegant and pleasing, but he was not to\r\n     be compared with Prince Louis Ferdinand. In his opinion he paid\r\n     the latter a high compliment when once he said to him that his\r\n     playing was not that of a king or prince but more like that of a\r\n     thoroughly good pianoforte player. He fell out with Himmel in the\r\n     following manner: One day when they were together Himmel begged\r\n     Beethoven to improvise; which Beethoven did. Afterwards Beethoven\r\n     insisted that Himmel do the same. The latter was weak enough\r\n     to agree; but after he had played for quite a time Beethoven\r\n     remarked: “Well, when are you going fairly to begin?” Himmel\r\n     had flattered himself that he had already performed wonders; he\r\n     jumped up and the men behaved ill towards each other. Beethoven\r\n     said to me: “I thought that Himmel had been only preluding a\r\n     bit.” Afterwards they were reconciled, indeed, but Himmel could\r\n     never forgive or forget[78]. They also exchanged letters until\r\n     Himmel played Beethoven a shabby trick. The latter always wanted\r\n     to know the news from Berlin. This bored Himmel, who at last\r\n     wrote that the greatest news from Berlin was that a lamp for the\r\n     blind had been invented. Beethoven ran about with the news and\r\n     all the world wanted to know how this was possible. Thereupon he\r\n     wrote to Himmel that he had blundered in not giving more explicit\r\n     information. The answer which he received, but which does not\r\n     permit of communication, not only put an end to the correspondence\r\n     but brought ridicule upon Beethoven, who was so inconsiderate as\r\n     to show it then and there.\r\n\r\nWith Carl Friedrich Christian Fasch and Carl Friedrich Zelter he also\r\nmade a friendly acquaintance, and twice at least attended meetings of\r\nthe Singakademie, which then numbered about 90 voices. The first time,\r\nJune 21st, says the “Geschichte der Singakademie”:\r\n\r\n     A chorale, the first three numbers of the mass and the first six\r\n     of the 119th Psalm were sung for him. Hereupon he seated himself\r\n     at the pianoforte and played an improvisation on the theme of the\r\n     final fugue: “Meine Zunge rühmt im Wettgesang dein Lob.” The last\r\n     numbers of “Davidiana” (a collection of versets by Fasch) formed\r\n     the conclusion. No biographer has mentioned this visit or even his\r\n     sojourn in Berlin. Nor does Fasch pay special attention to it;\r\n     but the performance must have pleased, for it was repeated at the\r\n     meeting on the 28th.\r\n\r\nThe performance of the Society must also have pleased Beethoven, and\r\nwith good reason; for Fasch’s mass was in sixteen parts and the psalm\r\nand “Davidiana,” in part, in eight; and no such music was then to be\r\nheard elsewhere north of the Alps.\r\n\r\nIn 1810, Beethoven, speaking of his playing on that occasion, told\r\nMme. von Arnim (then Elizabeth Brentano) that at the close his hearers\r\ndid not applaud but came crowding around him weeping; and added,\r\nironically, “that is not what we artists wish--we want applause!”\r\nFasch’s simple record of Beethoven’s visit is this:\r\n\r\n     June 21, 1796. Mr. van Beethoven extemporized on the “Davidiana,”\r\n     taking the fugue theme from Ps. 119, No. 16.... Mr. Beethoven,\r\n     pianist from Vienna, was so accommodating as to permit us to hear\r\n     an improvisation. . . . June 28, Mr. van Beethoven was again so\r\n     obliging as to play an improvisation for us.\r\n\r\nEarly in July, the King left Berlin for the baths of Pyrmont, the\r\nnobility dispersed to their estates or to watering-places, and the\r\ncity “was empty and silent.” Beethoven, therefore, could have had no\r\ninducement to prolong his stay; but the precise time of his departure\r\nis unknown. Schindler names Leipsic as one of the cities in which,\r\nduring this tour, Beethoven “awakened interest and created a sensation\r\nby his pianoforte playing, and, particularly, by his brilliant\r\nimprovisation”; but no allusion in any public journal of that or any\r\nsubsequent period, not even the faintest tradition, has been discovered\r\nto confirm the evidently erroneous statements. Moreover, Rochlitz in\r\nhis account of a visit to the composer in 1822 remarks, “I had not yet\r\nseen Beethoven”; and again, “It was only as a youth that he ... passed\r\nthrough (Leipsic).” So, until some new discovery be made, this must\r\nalso find its place in the long list of Schindler’s mistakes.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Wegeler’s statement (“Notizen,” 28) that he left\r\nBeethoven a member of the family of Prince Lichnowsky “in the middle\r\nof 1796,” it is as certain as circumstantial evidence can well make\r\nit that the Doctor and Christoph von Breuning had returned to Bonn\r\nbefore Beethoven reached Vienna again; but Stephan and Lenz were still\r\nthere. The former obtained at this time an appointment in the Teutonic\r\nOrder, which so many of his ancestors had served, and his name appears\r\nin the published “Calendars of the Order” from 1797 to 1803, both\r\ninclusive, as “Hofrathsassessor.” He then soon departed from Vienna to\r\nMergentheim, whence he wrote (November 23rd) with other matters the\r\nfollowing upon Beethoven to Wegeler and Christoph:\r\n\r\n     I do not know whether or not Lenz has written you anything about\r\n     Beethoven; but take notice that I saw him in Vienna and that\r\n     according to my mind, which Lenz has confirmed, he has become\r\n     somewhat staider, or, perhaps I should say, has acquired more\r\n     knowledge of humanity through travels (or was it because of the\r\n     new ebullition of friendship on his arrival?) and a greater\r\n     conviction of the scarceness and value of good friends. A hundred\r\n     times, dear Wegeler, he wishes you here again, and regrets nothing\r\n     so much as that he did not follow much of your advice. (“Notizen,”\r\n     page 19.)\r\n\r\nExcept this notice of his bearing and demeanor, there is a complete\r\nhiatus in Beethoven’s history from his appearance in the Singakademie\r\nuntil the following November. The so-called Fischoff Manuscript has,\r\nit is true, a story of a “dangerous illness” which was caused by his\r\nown imprudence this summer; but as it is in date utterly irreconcilable\r\nwith other known facts, it will receive its due consideration\r\nhereafter. The most plausible suggestion is that coming back, flushed\r\nwith victory, with the success of his tour and delighted with the\r\nnovelty of travelling at his ease, he made that excursion to Pressburg\r\nand Pesth of which afterwards Ries was informed and made record\r\n(“Notizen,” page 109), but of which no other account is known.\r\n\r\nATTEMPTS AT PATRIOTIC MUSIC\r\n\r\nAnd thus we come to November. This was the year of that astounding\r\nseries of victories ending at Arcole, gained by the young French\r\ngeneral Napoleon Bonaparte. The Austrian government and people alike\r\nsaw and feared the danger of invasion, a general uprising took place\r\nand volunteer corps were formed in all quarters. For the Vienna corps,\r\nFriedelberg wrote his “Abschiedsgesang an Wiens Bürger beim Auszug\r\nder Fahnen-Division der Wiener Freiwilliger,” and Beethoven set it\r\nto music. The original printed edition bears date “November 15,\r\n1795.” It does not appear to have gained any great popularity, and\r\na drinking-song (“Lasst das Herz uns froh erheben”) was afterwards\r\nsubstituted for Friedelberg’s text, and published by Schott in Mayence.\r\n\r\nThe rapid progress of the French army had caused the Germans in Italy\r\nto become distrustful of the future and to hasten homeward. Among them\r\nwere Beethoven’s old companions in the Bonn orchestra, the cousins\r\nAndreas and Bernhard Romberg, who in the spring of this year (May\r\n26th), had kissed the hand of the Queen of Naples, daughter of the\r\nEmpress Maria Theresia, and then departed to Rome to join another\r\nfriend of the Bonn period, Karl Kügelgen. The three coming north\r\narrived at Vienna in the autumn; the Rombergs remained there for a\r\nspace with Beethoven, while Kügelgen proceeded to Berlin. Baron von\r\nBraun--not to be mistaken for Beethoven’s “first Mæcenas” the Russian\r\nCount Browne--had heard the cousins the year before in Munich and\r\ninvited them “to give Vienna an opportunity to hear them.” There is no\r\nnotice of their concert in the Vienna newspapers of the period, and the\r\ndate is unknown. From Lenz von Breuning is gleaned an additional fact\r\nwhich alone gives interest to the concert for us. He writes to Wegeler\r\nin January, 1797--not 1796, as erroneously printed in the appendix to\r\nthe “Notizen,” page 20--and after the meeting with the von Breunings at\r\nNuremberg:\r\n\r\n     Beethoven is here again;[79] he played in the Romberg concert. He\r\n     is the same as of old and I am glad that he and the Rombergs still\r\n     get along with each other. Once he was near a break with them; I\r\n     interceded and achieved my end to a fair extent. Moreover, he\r\n     thinks a great deal of me just now.\r\n\r\nIt it clear that the Rombergs, under the circumstances, must have\r\nlargely owed their limited success to Beethoven’s name and influence.\r\nIn February, 1797, they were again in their old positions in\r\nSchroeder’s orchestra in Hamburg.\r\n\r\nBeethoven during this winter must be imagined busily engaged with\r\npupils and private concerts, perhaps also with his operatic studies\r\nwith Salieri, certainly with composition and with preparation for and\r\nthe oversight of various works then passing through the press; for in\r\nFebruary and April, Artaria advertises the two Violoncello Sonatas, Op.\r\n5, the Pianoforte Sonata for four hands, Op. 6, the Trio, Op. 3, the\r\nQuintet, Op. 4, and the Twelve Variations on a Danse Russe; these last\r\nare the variations which he dedicated to the Countess Browne and which\r\ngave occasion for the anecdote related by Ries illustrating Beethoven’s\r\nforgetfulness; for this dedication he had\r\n\r\n     received a handsome riding-horse from Count Browne as a gift.\r\n     He rode the animal a few times, soon after forgot all about\r\n     it and, worse than that, its food also. His servant, who soon\r\n     noticed this, began to hire out the horse for his own benefit\r\n     and, in order not to attract the attention of Beethoven to the\r\n     fact, for a long time withheld from him all bills for fodder. At\r\n     length, however, to Beethoven’s great amazement he handed in a\r\n     very large one, which recalled to him at once his horse and his\r\n     neglectfulness. (“Notizen,” page 120.)\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, April 6, 1797, Schuppanzigh gave a concert, on the\r\nprogramme of which Beethoven’s name figured twice. Number 2 was an\r\n“Aria by Mr. van Beethoven, sung by Madame Tribolet (-Willmann);” No.\r\n3 was “a Quintet for Pianoforte and 4 wind-instruments, played and\r\ncomposed by Mr. L. v. Beethoven.” This was the beautiful Quintet, Op.\r\n16, the time of whose origin is thus more definitely indicated than in\r\nthe “Chronologisches Verzeichniss,” a fact for which we are indebted to\r\nNottebohm.\r\n\r\nBut the war was renewed and the thoughts of the Viennese were occupied\r\nwith matters more serious than the indulgence of their musical taste.\r\nOn the 16th of March, Bonaparte forced the passage of the Tagliamento\r\nand Isonzo. During the two weeks following he had conquered the\r\ngreater part of Carniola, Carinthia and the Tyrol, and was now rapidly\r\napproaching Vienna. On the 11th of February, Lorenz Leopold Hauschka’s\r\n“Gott erhalte unsern Kaiser” with Haydn’s music had been sung for the\r\nfirst time in the theatre and now, when, on April 7th, the Landsturm\r\nwas called out, Friedelberg produced his war-song “Ein grosses,\r\ndeutsches Volk sind wir,” to which Beethoven also gave music. The\r\nprinted copy bears date April 14th, suggesting the probability that it\r\nwas sung on the occasion of the grand consecration of the banners which\r\ntook place on the Glacis on the 17th. Beethoven’s music was, however,\r\nfar from being so fortunate as Haydn’s, and seems to have gained as\r\nlittle popularity as his previous attempt; but as the preliminaries to\r\na treaty of peace were signed at Leoben on the 18th, and the armies, so\r\nhastily improvised, were dismissed three weeks afterwards, the taste\r\nfor war-songs vanished.\r\n\r\nA QUIET AND UNEVENTFUL PERIOD\r\n\r\nThe little that is known of Beethoven’s position as a teacher at this\r\nperiod is very vague and unsatisfactory; enough, however, to render it\r\nsufficiently certain that he had plenty of pupils, many of them young\r\nladies of high rank who paid him generously. In the triple capacity of\r\nteacher, composer and pianist his gains were large and he was able to\r\nwrite in May to Wegeler that he was doing well and steadily better.\r\n\r\nIt is very possible that the illness mentioned by the Fischoff\r\nManuscript may have occurred during this summer. There can be little\r\ndoubt that the original authority for the statement is Zmeskall, and\r\ntherefore the fact of such an attack may be accepted as certain,\r\nbut the date--being, as there given, clearly wrong, as well as\r\nthe inference that in it lay the original cause of the composer’s\r\nsubsequent loss of hearing--must be left mainly to conjecture. From May\r\nto November, 1797, Beethoven’s history is still a blank and nothing but\r\nthe utter silence of Lenz von Breuning in his correspondence with his\r\nfamily at Bonn on a topic so likely to engage his sympathies as the\r\ndangerous illness of his friend, appears to prevent the filling of this\r\nblank in part by throwing him upon a bed of sickness. True, Lenz may\r\nhave written and the letter have been lost or destroyed; or he may have\r\nneglected to write because of his approaching departure from Vienna,\r\nwhich took place in the autumn. His album, still preserved, has among\r\nits contributors Ludwig and Johann van Beethoven and Zmeskall. Ludwig\r\nwrote as follows:\r\n\r\n    Truth exists for the wise,\r\n    Beauty for a feeling heart:\r\n    They belong to each other.\r\n\r\n    Dear, good Breuning;\r\n\r\n     Never shall I forget the time which I spent with you in Bonn as\r\n     well as here. Hold fast your friendship for me; you will always\r\n     find me the same.\r\n\r\n    Vienna 1797\r\n    the 1st of October.\r\n    Your true friend\r\n    L. v. Beethoven.\r\n\r\nThey never met again. Lenz died on April 10th of the following year.\r\nIn November, Beethoven enjoyed a singular compliment paid him by the\r\nassociation of the Bildende Künstler--a repetition of his minuets and\r\ntrios composed two years before for the artists’ ball; and on the 23rd\r\nof December, he again contributed to the attractions of the Widows’ and\r\nOrphans’ Concert by producing the Variations for two Oboes and English\r\nHorn on “Là ci darem la mano,” played by Czerwenka, Reuter and Teimer.\r\nHis publications in 1797, besides those mentioned at the beginning of\r\nthe year, were the Twelve Variations for Pianoforte and Violoncello on\r\nthe theme from Handel’s “Judas Maccabæus,” precise date unknown; the\r\nPianoforte Sonata, Op. 7; and the Serenade, Op. 8, both advertised by\r\nArtaria and Co., October 7th. Finally, the Rondo in C, Op. 51, No. 1,\r\npublished by Artaria with the catalogue number 711.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe come to a consideration of the facts touching the compositions of\r\nthe years 1796 and 1797.\r\n\r\nTHE COMPOSITION OF “ADELAIDE”\r\n\r\nAmong the most widely known of these is “Adelaide.” The composition\r\nof this song must have been begun in the first half of 1795, if not\r\nearlier, for sketches of it are found among the exercises in double\r\ncounterpoint written for Albrechtsberger. Other sheets containing\r\nsketches for “Adelaide” and the setting of Bürger’s “Seufzer eines\r\nUngeliebten” are preserved in the library of the Gesellschaft der\r\nMusikfreunde in Vienna and the British Museum in London. The song was\r\npublished by Artaria in 1797, under the title “Adelaide von Matthisson.\r\nEine Kantate für eine Singstimme mit Begleitung des Klaviers. In Musik\r\ngesetzt und dem Verfasser gewidmet von Ludwig van Beethoven.” The opus\r\nnumber 46 was given to it later. In 1800 Beethoven sent a copy of the\r\nsong to the poet and accompanied it with the following letter:\r\n\r\n     Most honored Sir!\r\n\r\n     You are herewith receiving from me a composition which has been\r\n     in print for several years, but concerning which you probably, to\r\n     my shame, know nothing. Perhaps I can excuse myself and explain\r\n     how it came about that I dedicated something to you which came so\r\n     warmly from my heart yet did not inform you of the fact, by saying\r\n     that at first I was unaware of your place of residence, and partly\r\n     also I was diffident, not knowing but that I had been over-hasty\r\n     in dedicating a work to you without knowing whether or not it met\r\n     with your approval.\r\n\r\n     Even now I send you “Adelaide” with some timidity. You know what\r\n     changes are wrought by a few years in an artist who is continually\r\n     going forward; the greater the progress one makes in art the less\r\n     one is satisfied with one’s older works. My most ardent wish will\r\n     be fulfilled if my musical setting of your heavenly “Adelaide”\r\n     does not wholly displease you, and if it should move you soon to\r\n     write another poem of its kind, and you, not finding my request\r\n     too immodest, should send it to me at once, I will put forth all\r\n     my powers to do your beautiful poetry justice. Look upon the\r\n     dedication as partly a token of the delight which the composition\r\n     of your A. gave me, partly as an evidence of my gratitude and\r\n     respect for the blessed pleasure which your poetry has always\r\n     given, _and always will_ give me.\r\n\r\n    Vienna, August 4th, 1800.\r\n\r\n    When playing “Adelaide” sometimes recall\r\n    your sincere admirer\r\n\r\n    Beethoven.\r\n\r\nWhether or not Matthisson answered this letter is not known; but when\r\nhe republished “Adelaide” in the first volume of his collected poems\r\nin 1815, he appended to it a note to this effect: “Several composers\r\nhave vitalized this little lyric fantasy with music; but according to\r\nmy strong conviction none of them so threw the text into the shade\r\nwith his melody as the highly gifted Ludwig van Beethoven in Vienna.”\r\nThe “Opferlied,” the words of which were also written by Matthisson,\r\nis one of the poems to which Beethoven repeatedly recurred. “It seems\r\nalways to have presented itself to him as a prayer,” says Nottebohm.\r\nIts last words, “The beautiful to the good,” were written in autograph\r\nalbums even in his later years. The origin of the composition is to\r\nbe ascribed to 1795, as Nottebohm enters it in his catalogue. It was\r\nthus possible for Wegeler to know it in 1797, when he put a Masonic\r\ntext under the music. It had not yet been published at that time,\r\nhowever, which fact accounts for the discovery of sketches for it in a\r\nsketchbook of 1798-1799 described by Nottebohm.\r\n\r\nIt was not published until later, probably in 1808, when it came with\r\ntwo other songs from the press of Simrock. Beethoven composed the\r\npoem a second time, utilizing the beginning of his first melody, for\r\nsolo, chorus and orchestra (Op. 121b). To this setting we shall recur\r\nhereafter. There is still another song which must be brought into the\r\nstory of this period. It is the “Seufzer eines Ungeliebten,” with\r\nits two parts based on two independent but related poems by Bürger.\r\nParticular interest attaches to the second part, “Gegenliebe,” from\r\nthe fact that its melody was used afterward by Beethoven for the\r\nvariations in the “Choral Fantasia,” Op. 80. Sketches for this melody\r\nare found associated with sketches for “Adelaide” on a sheet in the\r\narchives of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde. Nottebohm fixes the year\r\nof the song’s origin as 1795. It was first published as late as 1837\r\nby Diabelli along with the song, “Turteltaube, du klagest,” which was\r\ncomposed much later. The Italian song, “O care selve, o cara felice\r\nlibertà” (from Metastasio’s “Olimpiade”), entered under number 1264\r\nin Thayer’s “Chronologisches Verzeichniss,” appears as a chorus for\r\nthree voices at the end of the Albrechtsberger exercises, and hence\r\nmay be placed in the year 1795, as is done by Nottebohm, who adds that\r\nit originated simultaneously with the setting of “Wer ist ein freier\r\nMann?” Here mention must also be made of two arias which Beethoven\r\nwrote for introduction in Umlauf’s comic opera “Die schöne Schusterin.”\r\nThese songs were assigned to the Bonn period in the first edition of\r\nthis biography because the opera was performed in Bonn in the years\r\n1789 and 1790. The two songs composed by Beethoven are an arietta, or\r\nrather strophic song, “O welch’ ein Leben,” for tenor, and an aria,\r\n“Soll ein Schuh nicht drücken?” for soprano. The words of the latter\r\nare in the original libretto. The words of the tenor song, though\r\nnot part of the original text, were obviously written for the opera.\r\nThe melody was afterward used by Beethoven as a setting for Goethe’s\r\n“Mailied,” published in 1805, as Op. 52. Both songs, as written for the\r\nopera, were published for the first time in the Complete Edition of\r\nBeethoven’s works from the copies preserved in the Berlin Library.\r\n\r\nNUMEROUS PIECES OF CHAMBER MUSIC\r\n\r\nMost important of the instrumental compositions of this period is\r\nthe Quintet for Strings, Op. 4, which is frequently set down as an\r\narrangement (or revised transcription) of the Octet, Op. 103. The\r\nQuintet, however, though it employs the same motivi as the Octet, is an\r\nentirely new work, made so by the radical changes of structure--changes\r\nof register to adapt the themes to the stringed instruments and changes\r\nin the themes themselves. The origin of the Quintet can be placed\r\nanywhere in the period from 1792 (when the Octet was probably begun) to\r\nthe beginning of 1797, when the Quintet was advertised as “wholly new.”\r\nThere is a clue in the Wegeler anecdote already related in connection\r\nwith the String Trio, Op. 3, in the chapter of this work devoted to the\r\nworks composed in Bonn. In 1795, Count Appony commissioned Beethoven to\r\ncompose a quartet, the honorarium being fixed. Wegeler’s recollection\r\nwas that Beethoven twice undertook the task; but the first effort\r\nresulted in the String Trio and the second in “a quintet (Op. 4).”\r\nThere is not sufficient internal evidence to reject the story so far as\r\nit affects the Quintet (the Trio has already been subjected to study),\r\nand from its structure it might well be argued that the composition was\r\nundertaken as a quartet and expanded into a quintet in the hands of\r\nthe composer. If Count Appony’s commission was given in 1795, the date\r\nof the completion of the Quintet may be set down as 1796. Artaria, who\r\npublished the work, advertised it in the “Wiener Zeitung” of February\r\n8th, 1797.\r\n\r\nThe two Sonatas for Pianoforte and Violoncello, Op. 5, belong to the\r\nyear 1796, and are the fruits of the visit to Berlin. There is no\r\nreason to question Ries’s story that Beethoven composed them for Pierre\r\nDuport and played them with him. The dedication to Friedrich Wilhelm\r\nII and the character of the works lend credibility to Ries’s account\r\nof their origin. Beethoven played them with Bernhard Romberg in Vienna\r\nat the close of 1796 or beginning of 1797, and they were published\r\nsoon afterward, being advertised by Artaria in the “Wiener Zeitung”\r\nof February 8th, 1797. The Twelve Variations on a theme from Handel’s\r\n“Judas Maccabæus,” were published by Artaria in 1797, dedicated to the\r\nPrincess Lichnowsky, _née_ Countess Thun. There were no performances\r\nof Handel’s oratorios in Vienna at this time, but it is not improbable\r\nthat the suggestion for the Variations came from Baron van Swieten.\r\n\r\nHere seems to be the place to refer to the Allegro movement in\r\nsonata-form for viola and violoncello which Beethoven gave the title,\r\n“Duett mit zwei Augengläsern obbligato von L. v. Beethoven” (Duet\r\nwith two Eyeglasses obbligato, by L. v. Beethoven), to be found in\r\nthe volume of sketches from this period (1784-1800) which the British\r\nMuseum bought from J. N. Kafka in 1875.[80] There ought to be a hint\r\nas to the identity of the two players “with two eyeglasses obbligato.”\r\nHere is also the place for the three Duos for Clarinet and Bassoon\r\nfirst published by André in Offenbach. The Sextet for Wind-Instruments\r\npublished by Breitkopf and Härtel in 1810 (it received the opus number\r\n71 later), belongs to this period. Sketches for the last movement,\r\nwhich differ from the ultimate form, however, are found amongst the\r\nsketches for the Pianoforte Sonata, Op. 10, No. 3. The inception of\r\nthe Sonata must fall sometime between the middle of 1796 and the\r\nmiddle of 1798, since the subscription for it was opened in the\r\nbeginning of July, 1798, and other works of a similar character were\r\nalready completed in 1797. It is, therefore, possible to place the\r\norigin of the earlier movements of the Sextet in an earlier period,\r\nsay 1796-97, a proceeding which is confirmed by the circumstance that\r\nthe beginning is found before sketches for “Ah, perfido!” (which was\r\ncomposed in 1796 at the latest), on a sheet of sketches in the Artaria\r\ncollection. The Kafka volume of sketches in the British Museum contains\r\nsketches for the minuet and trio of the Sextet, “Ah, perfido!” and the\r\nPianoforte Sonata, Op. 49, No. 2. This fact also indicates the year\r\n1796. Beethoven let the work lie a long time. It had its first hearing\r\nat a chamber concert for the benefit of Schuppanzigh in April, 1805;\r\nbut it was not until 1809 that he gave it out for publication. On\r\nAugust 3rd of that year he wrote to Breitkopf and Härtel: “By the next\r\nmail-coach you will receive a song, _or perhaps two_, and a sextet for\r\nwind-instruments,” and on August 8th: “The sextet is one of my earlier\r\nthings and, moreover, was written in a single night--nothing can really\r\nbe said of it beyond that it was written by an author who at least has\r\nproduced a few better works; yet for many people such works are the\r\nbest.” The statement that the work was written in a single night must\r\nbe taken in a Pickwickian sense, for sketches of it have been found.\r\n\r\nPREDILECTION FOR WIND-INSTRUMENTS\r\n\r\nIt is plain that at this time Beethoven had a particular predilection\r\nfor wind-instruments. Erich Prieger owned a fragment of a Quintet in\r\nE-flat for Oboe, three Horns and Bassoon, formerly in the possession\r\nof Artaria. The beginning of the first movement is lacking, but can\r\nbe supplied from the repetition in the second part. The Adagio is\r\nintact, but there are only a few measures of the Minuet. Influenced,\r\nno doubt, by the performances of such compositions, Beethoven composed\r\nat this time two works for two oboes and English horn. Nottebohm\r\nsurmises that they were instigated by a terzetto for two oboes and\r\nEnglish horn composed by a musician named Wendt and performed at a\r\nconcert of the Tonkünstler-Gesellschaft by three brothers, Johann,\r\nFranz and Philipp Teimer, on December 23rd, 1793. One of the two works,\r\nthe Trio which was published as Op. 87, is pretty well known, since\r\nit was made accessible to wider circles by arrangements published in\r\nBeethoven’s day and with his approval. Artaria published it in April,\r\n1806, without opus number. He also published it for two violins and\r\nviola as Op. 29, and finally as a Sonata for Pianoforte and Violin.\r\nThe last transcription was published first, as stated in Thayer’s\r\nCatalogue. Nothing of a historical nature is known of the Variations on\r\n“Là ci darem” for the same instruments beyond the fact that they were\r\nperformed on December 23rd, 1797, at the concert for the benefit of the\r\nWidows and Orphans in the National Court Theatre. On a free page of\r\nthe autograph (after the sixth variation) there are some miscellaneous\r\nsketches, among them a motive for the Adagio of Op. 3, another which\r\nwas used in the Serenade, Op. 25, and, more remarkable still, a few\r\nmeasures of “Adelaide,” on which he was at work in 1793, and which\r\nappeared in print in 1797. Obviously, the Variations were finished, and\r\nwe may set down at the latest the year 1795 for their beginning.\r\n\r\nThe Sextet for four stringed instruments and two horns, Op. 81b, also\r\nbelongs to this early period and in all likelihood was conceived before\r\nthe Sextet for wind-instruments. Sketches for the first two movements\r\nare upon a sheet in the Berlin library by the side of sketches for the\r\nsong, “Seufzer eines Ungeliebten.” Sketches for this song keep company\r\nwith some for “Adelaide.” The Sextet is therefore to be credited to\r\nthe year 1795, or perhaps 1794. It was published in 1819 by Simrock\r\nin Bonn. In a letter which Beethoven sent to Simrock with the MS.\r\n(but which has been lost) he had written to the publisher, who was an\r\nadmirable horn player, that “the pupil had given his master many a hard\r\nnut to crack.” As to whether or not, and if so when and where, the\r\nSextet had been played before being sent to Simrock there is, as yet,\r\nno conclusive evidence.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful Quintet in E flat, Op. 16, for Pianoforte and\r\nWind-instruments, was played at a concert given by Schuppanzigh on\r\nApril 6th, 1797, being number 5 on the programme which described it as\r\n“A Quintet for the Fortepiano accompanied by four Wind-Instruments,\r\nplayed and composed by Mr. Ludwig van Beethoven.” It had probably been\r\ncompleted not long before. Sketches are found in connection with a\r\nremark concerning the Sonata in C minor, Op. 10, No. 1.\r\n\r\nIt was in all probability composed between 1794 and the beginning of\r\n1797. In the minutes of a meeting of the Tonkünstler-Gesellschaft under\r\ndate May 10th, 1797, occurs this entry: “On the second day Mr. van\r\nBeethoven produced a Quintet and distinguished himself in the Quintet\r\nand incidentally by an improvisation.” The word “dabey” (incidentally)\r\nseems to indicate that he introduced an improvisation in the Quintet\r\nas he did on a later occasion to the embarrassment of the other\r\nplayers, but to the delight of the listeners. Ries tells the story in\r\nhis “Notizen,” p. 79. It was at a concert at which the famous oboist\r\nFriedrich Ramm, of Munich, took part.\r\n\r\n     In the final Allegro there occur several holds before a resumption\r\n     of the theme. At one of these Beethoven suddenly began to\r\n     improvise, took the Rondo as a theme and entertained himself and\r\n     the others for a considerable space; but not his associates. They\r\n     were displeased, and Ramm even enraged (_aufgebracht_). It really\r\n     was comical to see these gentlemen waiting expectantly every\r\n     moment to go on, continually lifting their instruments to their\r\n     lips, then quietly putting them down again. At last Beethoven was\r\n     satisfied and dropped again into the Rondo. The entire audience\r\n     was delighted.\r\n\r\nWasielewski doubts the correctness of the story, since there is but\r\none hold in the Finale. Dr. Deiters thought that Ries confounded the\r\nlast with the first movement, in which the clarinet enters after a\r\n_fermata_. The Quintet was published by Mollo in Vienna in 1801, and\r\nwas dedicated to Prince Schwarzenberg. It appeared simultaneously in\r\none arrangement made by Beethoven himself as a Quartet for Pianoforte\r\nand Strings, as Ries expressly declares. Beethoven had nothing to do\r\nwith the arrangement as a String Quartet published by Artaria as Op. 75.\r\n\r\nTouching the history of the Serenade for Violin, Viola and Violoncello,\r\nOp. 8, little else is known beyond the fact that its publication was\r\nannounced in the “Wiener Zeitung” on October 7th, 1797, by Artaria. Mr.\r\nShedlock called attention in the “Musical Times” of 1892 (p. 525) to\r\nsketches which appeared along with others of the Pianoforte Concerto\r\nin B-flat, and the Trio, Op. 1, No. 2. That Beethoven valued the work\r\nhighly is a fair deduction from the fact that he published it soon\r\nafter its composition and authorized the publication of an arrangement\r\nfor Pianoforte and Viola which he had revised. This arrangement\r\nreceived the opus number 42, though probably not from Beethoven.\r\nHoffmeister in Leipzig, who published it in 1804, under the title\r\n“Notturno pour Fortepiano et Alto arrangé d’un Notturno pour Violon,\r\nAlto et Violoncello et revu par l’auteur--Œuvre 42,” advertised it\r\nin the “Intelligenzblatt der Zeitschrift für die elegante Welt” on\r\nDecember 17, 1803. It is this arrangement, no doubt, to which Beethoven\r\nreferred in a letter to Hoffmeister, dated September 22nd, 1803, in\r\nwhich he said: “These transcriptions are not mine, though they were\r\nmuch improved by me in places. Therefore, I am not willing to have\r\nyou state that I made them, for that would be a lie and I could find\r\nneither time nor patience for such work.” According to the view of Dr.\r\nDeiters, which was shared also by Nottebohm, the Serenade, Op. 25,\r\nalso belongs here. It was probably composed before Op. 8. Beethoven\r\nentrusted its publication in the beginning of 1802 to Cappi, who had\r\njust begun business. Then, like Op. 8, it was published by Hoffmeister\r\nas Op. 41, in an arrangement for Pianoforte and Flute (or Violin),\r\nwhich, no doubt, was included in Beethoven’s protest against being set\r\ndown as the transcriber.\r\n\r\nA GROUP OF PIANOFORTE SONATAS\r\n\r\nProminent among the compositions of this time is the Sonata in\r\nE-flat for Pianoforte, Op. 7. The only evidence of the date of its\r\ncomposition is the announcement of its publication by Artaria in the\r\n“Wiener Zeitung” of October 7th, 1797. There are sketches for the third\r\nmovement in the Kafka volume, but they afford no help in fixing a date.\r\nThe Sonata is inscribed to the Countess Babette Keglevich, one of\r\nBeethoven’s pupils, who afterwards married Prince Innocenz Odescalchi\r\nin Pressburg. Nottebohm quotes the following from a letter written by\r\na nephew of the Countess: “The Sonata was composed for her when she\r\nwas still a maiden. It was one of the hobbies, of which he (Beethoven)\r\nhad many, that, living as he did _vis-à-vis_, he came in morning\r\ngown, slippers and tasseled cap (_Zipfelmütze_) to give her lessons.”\r\nInasmuch as the sketches mentioned belong only to the third movement\r\nand the sheet contains the remark: “diverse 4 bagatelles de inglese\r\nLändler, etc.,” Nottebohm supposes that the movement was originally\r\nintended for one of the Bagatelles and was later incorporated in the\r\nSonata. It is very probable that the two little Sonatas, Op. 49, belong\r\nto this period. Everybody knows that the second movement of the second\r\nSonata (the minuet) is based on the same motive as the third movement\r\nof the Septet. That the motive is older in the Sonata than in the\r\nSeptet is proved by the fact that sketches for it are found along with\r\nsome to “Ah, perfido!” (1795-96) and the Sextet for Wind-instruments,\r\nOp. 71. This circumstance establishes its early origin, say in 1795\r\nor, at latest, 1796. Nottebohm considers it likely that the first\r\nSonata was finished at the latest in 1798, certainly before the Sonata\r\n“Pathétique” and the Trio for strings, Op. 9, No. 3. The Sonatas were\r\nready for publication as early as 1802, in which year brother Carl\r\noffered them to André in Offenbach. They were not published until\r\n1805, when they appeared with the imprint of the Bureau d’Arts et\r\nd’Industrie, as appears from an advertisement in the “Wiener Zeitung”\r\nof January l9th, 1805. Here, too, belongs the little Sonata in D for\r\nfour hands, Op. 6, published by Artaria in October, 1797, as Nottebohm\r\nsurmises. It was probably composed for purposes of instruction. Except\r\na few trifles (marches, and two sets of variations) Beethoven wrote\r\nnothing more for four hands, though Diabelli offered him 40 ducats for\r\na four-hand sonata in 1824.\r\n\r\nIn the pianoforte compositions of these two years are to be included\r\nthe Variations in A on a Russian dance from the ballet “Das\r\nWaldmädchen,” published in April, 1797, and dedicated to the Countess\r\nBrowne, _née_ Bietinghoff. “Das Waldmädchen,” by Traffieri, music by\r\nPaul Wranitzky, was first performed at the Kärnthnerthor-Theater on\r\nSeptember 28, 1796, and was repeated sixteen times the same year. This\r\nfixes the time of the composition of the Variations approximately. They\r\nwere probably written before the end of 1796.\r\n\r\nThere are a few other compositions brought to light by Nottebohm and\r\nMandyczewski, which call for notice. No. 299, Series XXV (Supplement),\r\nB. and H. Complete Works, is an Allegretto in C minor, 3/4 time; No.\r\n295 a Bagatelle, also in C minor 3/4, Presto, sketches for which are\r\nassociated with those for the C minor Sonata, Op. 10, No. 1. From the\r\nremark: “Very short minuets to the new sonatas. The Presto remains for\r\nthat in C minor,” written about this time Nottebohm concludes that this\r\nBagatelle was conceived as an intermezzo in the C minor Sonata, and\r\nthat, possibly, the Allegretto had a similar origin.[81]\r\n\r\nA unique place among Beethoven’s early works is occupied by the two\r\npieces for mandolin with pianoforte accompaniment first published in\r\nthe Complete Edition. Thayer, who knew of the sketches at Artaria’s,\r\nbut seems not to have seen the composition recovered by Nottebohm,\r\nwhich is called Sonatine, associated Beethoven’s purpose with\r\nKrumpholz, who was a virtuoso on the mandolin; but Mylich, Amenda’s\r\nstudent companion, may have been in the composer’s mind.\r\n\r\nThe fact that no compositions for orchestra save the dances for the\r\nRedoutensaal, to be referred to presently, have been preserved, is not\r\nto be taken as conclusive evidence that Beethoven did not venture into\r\nthe field of orchestral music in the Bonn and early Vienna days. Such\r\nan assertion is less likely to be made now than before the discovery of\r\nthe two Imperial cantatas of 1790. Moreover, Mr. Shedlock’s extracts\r\nfrom the Kafka sketchbook in the British Museum show that Beethoven\r\ntried his youthful hand at a symphony. Among the earliest of the\r\nsketches there is one in C minor marked “Sinfonia,” which begins as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE “JENA” SYMPHONY AND SOME DANCES\r\n\r\nNottebohm notes the theme also in his “Zweite Beethoveniana” (p. 577).\r\nShedlock’s contention that out of this theme grew the second movement\r\nof the first Pianoforte Quartet (composed in 1785) is incontestable.\r\nThe symphonic sketch is therefore of earlier date than 1785. In\r\n1909, Prof. Fritz Stein, Musical Director of the University of Jena,\r\nannounced that in the collection of music of the Academic Concerts,\r\nfounded in 1780, he had discovered the complete parts of a symphony in\r\nfour movements in C “par Louis van Beethoven.” These words are in the\r\nhandwriting of the copyist on the second violin part; on the ’cello\r\npart is written: “Symphonie von Beethoven.” Dr. Hugo Riemann,[82]\r\nafter a glance through the score prepared by Prof. Stein and put at\r\nhis disposal, gave it as his opinion that the symphony might well be a\r\ncomposition by Beethoven. Thematically, he says it suggests partly the\r\nMannheim school, partly Haydn; the instrumentation is nearer Mozart\r\nthan Stamitz or Cannabich.\r\n\r\nMention of Beethoven’s orchestral dances has already been made.\r\nSchindler’s remark that the musicians of Vienna “refused citizenship”\r\nto Beethoven’s efforts to write Austrian dance music is discredited,\r\nat least so far as Viennese society is concerned, by the success of\r\nhis dances composed for the Redoutensaal and the very considerable\r\nnumber of his waltzes, ländlers, minuets, écossaises, allemandes and\r\ncontra-dances which have been preserved. Only the smaller portion of\r\nthese dances have been included in the Complete Edition of Breitkopf\r\nand Härtel. Thus in Series II there are 12 minuets and 12 German\r\ndances; in Series XXV (Supplement), 6 “Ländrische Tänze” for two\r\nviolins and bass, 6 German dances for pianoforte and violin, and, for\r\npianoforte alone, 6 German dances, 6 écossaises and a few miscellaneous\r\ndances; in Series XVIII (Small Pieces for Pianoforte) there are 6\r\nminuets and 13 “Ländrische” (1-6 identical with those numbered 7-13 in\r\nSeries II, but transcribed). There are many dances as yet unpublished.\r\nFor instance, among the Artaria MSS, purchased by Erich Prieger, there\r\nare 12 écossaises, of which 6 are as yet unknown, also 12 “Deutsche”\r\nfor pianoforte and 6 minuets for two violins and bass, which have\r\nnever been printed. The three orchestral dances noted by Thayer in the\r\nThematic Catalogue as No. 290, of the Artaria collection, are Nos.\r\n3, 9 and 11 of the 12 minuets which A. von Perger discovered in the\r\narchives of the Künstler-Pensions-Institut in 1872, and which were\r\npublished by Hengel in Paris in pianoforte transcription in 1903 and in\r\nscore and parts in 1906, edited by Chantavoine. They were composed for\r\nthe Künstlersocietät and are now in the Court Library at Vienna. (MS.\r\n16,925.)\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[75] It is now No. 16 of the extended Operngasse.\r\n\r\n[76] Czerny described Beethoven’s brothers to Otto Jahn as follows:\r\n“Carl: small of stature, red-haired, ugly; Johann: large, dark, a\r\nhandsome man and complete dandy.”\r\n\r\n[77] “Mr. von Z.” is doubtless Zmeskall, who is thus shown to have been\r\na trusted friend of Beethoven’s in 1796. “This time” indicates plainly\r\nthat Beethoven had been in Prague before. Through the words: “Greetings\r\nto Brother Caspar” the pen has been heavily drawn, and, if the color of\r\nthe ink can be trusted after so many years, it was done at the time of\r\nwriting. “F. Linowsky” is Fürst (Prince) Lichnowsky.\r\n\r\n[78] Beethoven told the story to Mme. von Arnim with the additional\r\nparticular that they were walking in Unter den Linden and went thence\r\ninto a private room of the principal coffee-house where there was a\r\npianoforte, for the exhibition of their skill.\r\n\r\n[79] After the journey to Pesth?\r\n\r\n[80] See the articles by J. S. Shedlock in “The Musical Times,” June to\r\nDecember, 1892. Mr. Shedlock made a copy of the duet for Dr. Deiters.\r\n\r\n[81] “Beethoveniana,” p. 31. Later Beethoven wanted to give the Sonata\r\nan Intermezzo in C major (Ibid., p. 479), but did not carry out the\r\nintention.\r\n\r\n[82] See Vol. II, p. 60, of the revised edition of “Ludwig van\r\nBeethoven’s Leben” by Thayer, 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV\r\n\r\n     General Bernadotte--His Connection with the “Heroic”\r\n     Symphony--Rival Pianists--J. Wölffl--Dragonetti and\r\n     Cramer--Compositions of the Years 1798 and 1799.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1798, a political event occurred which demands notice\r\nhere from its connection with one of Beethoven’s noblest and most\r\noriginal works--the “Sinfonia Eroica.” The singular tissue of error\r\nwhich, owing to carelessness in observing dates, has been woven in\r\nrelation to its origin may be best destroyed by a simple statement of\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary demands made by the French Directory upon the\r\nAustrian government as preliminary to the renewal of diplomatic\r\nintercourse, after the peace of Campo Formio--such as a national palace\r\nand French theatre for the minister and the right of jurisdiction over\r\nall Frenchmen in the Austrian dominions--all of which were rejected\r\nby the Imperial government, had aroused to a high pitch the public\r\ncuriosity both as to the man who might be selected for the appointment\r\nand as to the course he might adopt. This curiosity was by no means\r\ndiminished by the intelligence that the new minister was Jean Baptiste\r\nBernadotte, the young general who had borne so important a part in the\r\nrecent invasion of Istria. He arrived in Vienna on February 5th, 1798.\r\nThe state of the Empress’s health, who was delivered of the Archduchess\r\nMaria Clementine on the 1st of March, delayed the private audience\r\nof Bernadotte for the presentation of his credentials to the Emperor\r\nuntil the second of that month, and his public audience until the 8th\r\nof April. During the festivities of the court, which then took place,\r\nBernadotte was always present, and a reporter of that day says both the\r\nEmperor and Empress held more conversation with him than with any other\r\nof the “cercle.” This familiar intercourse, however, came speedily to\r\nan end; for on the 13th Bernadotte had the rashness to display the\r\nhated tricolor from his balcony and to threaten to defend it by force.\r\nA riot occurred, and it was thought that in the extreme excitement of\r\npopular feeling nothing but the strong detachments of cavalry and\r\ninfantry detailed for his protection saved his life--saved it to ascend\r\nthe throne of Sweden on the twentieth anniversary of his arrival in\r\nVienna!\r\n\r\nSince etiquette allowed a foreign minister neither to make nor receive\r\nvisits in his public capacity until after his formal reception at\r\ncourt, the General, during the two months of his stay, except the last\r\nfive days, “lived very quietly.” Those who saw him praised him as “well\r\nbehaved, sedate and modest.” In his train was Rudolph Kreutzer, the\r\ngreat violinist.\r\n\r\nBERNADOTTE AND THE HEROIC SYMPHONY\r\n\r\nBernadotte had now just entered his 34th year; Kreutzer was in his\r\n32nd; both of them, therefore, in age, as in tastes and acquirements,\r\nfitted to appreciate the splendor of Beethoven’s genius and to enjoy\r\nhis society. Moreover, as the Ambassador was the son of a provincial\r\nadvocate, there was no difference of rank by birth, which could prevent\r\nthem from meeting upon equal terms. Under such circumstances, and\r\nremembering that just at that epoch the young General Bonaparte was the\r\ntopic of universal wonder and admiration, one is fully prepared for the\r\nstatement of Schindler upon the origin of the “Heroic” Symphony:\r\n\r\n     The first idea for the symphony is said to have gone out from\r\n     General Bernadotte, then French Ambassador in Vienna, who esteemed\r\n     Beethoven very highly. This I heard from several of Beethoven’s\r\n     friends. I was also told so by Count Moritz Lichnowsky (brother\r\n     of Prince Lichnowsky), who was often in the society of Bernadotte\r\n     with Beethoven....\r\n\r\nAgain in 1823:\r\n\r\n     Beethoven had a lively recollection that Bernadotte had really\r\n     first inspired him with the idea of the “Eroica” Symphony.\r\n\r\nThis is from Schindler’s work in its first form. His unfortunate\r\npropensity sometimes to accept the illusions of his fancy for matters\r\nof fact is exhibited in the corresponding passage in his third edition:\r\n\r\n     In Bernadotte’s salon, which was open to notabilities of all ranks\r\n     of life, Beethoven also appeared. He had already made it known\r\n     that he was a great admirer of the First Consul of the Republic.\r\n     From the General emanated the suggestion that Beethoven celebrate\r\n     the greatest hero of his age in a musical composition. It was not\r\n     long (!) before the thought had become a deed. (Vol. I, page 101.)\r\n\r\nIn proceeding with the history of the Symphony, Schindler extracts\r\nlargely from Beethoven’s own copy of Schleiermacher’s translation of\r\nPlato. That the idea of Bonaparte as First Consul may have influenced\r\nthe form and matter of the Symphony, when he came to the labor of its\r\ncomposition, and that Beethoven may have based for himself a sort of\r\nsystem of political ethics upon Schleiermacher’s Plato--all this is\r\nvery possible; but Bernadotte was far away from Vienna before the\r\nconsular form of government was adopted at Paris, and the “Sinfonia\r\nEroica” had been publicly performed at Vienna before the Plato came\r\nfrom the Berlin press!\r\n\r\nIt is certainly to be regretted that so much fine writing by Schindler\r\nand his copyists on this point should be exploded by a date--like\r\na ship by a single shell; but how could anyone believe that the\r\nmuch-employed Beethoven, at the age of 27, he who had refused two years\r\nbefore, even despite Wegeler’s urging, to listen to a single private\r\nlecture on Kant, had become in so short a time a Platonic philosopher?\r\n\r\nLet us return to a field where Beethoven was even now more at home\r\nthan he ever became in Plato’s political philosophy. Salieri had again\r\nengaged him for the “Widows and Orphans” concerts of April 1st and 2nd\r\nat which Haydn’s “Seven Last Words” was sung and Beethoven’s Pianoforte\r\nQuintet played. Kaiser Franz and the imperial family were present.\r\n\r\nRIVALRY OF BEETHOVEN AND WÖLFFL\r\n\r\nIt was now no longer the case that Beethoven was without a rival as\r\npianoforte virtuoso. He had a competitor fully worthy of his powers;\r\none who divided about equally with him the suffrages of the leaders in\r\nthe Vienna musical circles. In fact the excellencies peculiar to the\r\ntwo were such and so different, that it depended upon the taste of the\r\nauditor to which he accorded the praise of superiority. Joseph Wölffl\r\nof Salzburg, two years younger than Beethoven, a “wonder-child,” who\r\nhad played a violin concerto in public at the age of seven years, was\r\na pupil of Leopold Mozart and Michael Haydn. Being in Vienna, when but\r\neighteen years old, he was engaged, on the recommendation of Mozart, by\r\nthe Polish count Oginsky, who took him to Warsaw. His success there,\r\nas pianoforte virtuoso, teacher and composer, was almost unexampled.\r\nBut it is only in his character as pianist that we have to do with him;\r\nand a reference may be made to the general principle, that a worthy\r\ncompetition is the best spur to genius. When we read in one of his\r\nletters Beethoven’s words “I have also greatly perfected my pianoforte\r\nplaying,” they will cause no surprise; for only by severe industry\r\nand consequent improvement could he retain his high position, in the\r\npresence of such rivals as Wölffl and, a year or two later, J. B.\r\nCramer. A lively picture of Wölffl by Tomaschek, who heard him in 1799,\r\nin his autobiography sufficiently proves that his party in Vienna was\r\ncomposed of those to whom extraordinary execution was the main thing;\r\nwhile Beethoven’s admirers were of those who had hearts to be touched.\r\nA parallel between Beethoven and Wölffl in a letter to the “Allgemeine\r\nMusikalische Zeitung” (Vol. I, pp. 24, 25) dated April 22, 1799, just\r\nat the time when the performances of both were topics of general\r\nconversation in musical circles, and still fresh in the memory of all\r\nwho had heard them, is in the highest degree apposite to the subject of\r\nthis chapter. The writer says:\r\n\r\n     Opinion is divided here touching the merits of the two; yet it\r\n     would seem as if the majority were on the side of the latter\r\n     (Wölffl). I shall try to set forth the peculiarities of each\r\n     without taking part in the controversy. Beethoven’s playing is\r\n     extremely brilliant but has less delicacy and occasionally he\r\n     is guilty of indistinctness. He shows himself to the greatest\r\n     advantage in improvisation, and here, indeed, it is most\r\n     extraordinary with what lightness and yet firmness in the\r\n     succession of ideas Beethoven not only varies a theme given him on\r\n     the spur of the moment by figuration (with which many a virtuoso\r\n     makes his fortune and--wind) but really develops it. Since the\r\n     death of Mozart, who in this respect is for me still the _non plus\r\n     ultra_, I have never enjoyed this kind of pleasure in the degree\r\n     in which it is provided by Beethoven. In this Wölffl fails to\r\n     reach him. But W. has advantages in this that, sound in musical\r\n     learning and dignified in his compositions, he plays passages\r\n     which seem impossible with an ease, precision and clearness\r\n     which cause amazement (of course he is helped here by the large\r\n     structure of his hands) and that his interpretation is always,\r\n     especially in Adagios, so pleasing and insinuating that one can\r\n     not only admire it but also enjoy.... That Wölffl likewise enjoys\r\n     an advantage because of his amiable bearing, contrasted with the\r\n     somewhat haughty pose of Beethoven, is very natural.\r\n\r\nNo biography of Beethoven which makes any pretence to completeness, can\r\nomit the somewhat inflated and bombastic account which Seyfried gives\r\nof the emulation between Beethoven and Wölffl. Ignatz von Seyfried at\r\nthe period in question was one of Schikaneder’s conductors, to which\r\nposition he had been called when not quite twenty-one years of age, and\r\nhad assumed its duties March 1, 1797. He was among the most promising\r\nof the young composers of the capital, belonged to a highly respectable\r\nfamily, had been educated at the University, and his personal character\r\nwas unblemished. He would, therefore, naturally have access to the\r\nmusical salons and his reminiscences of music and musicians in those\r\nyears may be accepted as the records of observation. The unfavorable\r\nlight which the researches of Nottebohm have thrown upon him as editor\r\nof the so-called “Beethoven Studien” does not extend to such statements\r\nof fact as might easily have come under his own cognizance; and the\r\npassage now cited from the appendix of the “Studien,” though written\r\nthirty years after the events it describes, bears all the marks of\r\nbeing a faithful transcript of the writer’s own memories:\r\n\r\n     Beethoven had already attracted attention to himself by several\r\n     compositions and was rated a first-class pianist in Vienna when\r\n     he was confronted by a rival in the closing years of the last\r\n     century. Thereupon there was, in a way, a revival of the old\r\n     Parisian feud of the Gluckists and Piccinists, and the many\r\n     friends of art in the Imperial City arrayed themselves in two\r\n     parties. At the head of Beethoven’s admirers stood the amiable\r\n     Prince Lichnowsky; among the most zealous patrons of Wölffl was\r\n     the broadly cultured Baron Raymond von Wetzlar, whose delightful\r\n     villa (on the Grünberg near the Emperor’s recreation-castle)\r\n     offered to all artists, native and foreign, an asylum in the\r\n     summer months, as pleasing as it was desirable, with true British\r\n     loyalty. There the interesting combats of the two athletes not\r\n     infrequently offered an indescribable artistic treat to the\r\n     numerous and thoroughly select gathering. Each brought forward the\r\n     latest product of his mind. Now one and anon the other gave free\r\n     rein to his glowing fancy; sometimes they would seat themselves\r\n     at two pianofortes and improvise alternately on themes which they\r\n     gave each other, and thus created many a four-hand Capriccio\r\n     which if it could have been put upon paper at the moment would\r\n     surely have bidden defiance to time. It would have been difficult,\r\n     perhaps impossible, to award the palm of victory to either one\r\n     of the gladiators in respect of technical skill. Nature had been\r\n     a particularly kind mother to Wölffl in bestowing upon him a\r\n     gigantic hand which could span a tenth as easily as other hands\r\n     compass an octave, and permitted him to play passages of double\r\n     notes in these intervals with the rapidity of lightning. In his\r\n     improvisations even then Beethoven did not deny his tendency\r\n     toward the mysterious and gloomy. When once he began to revel\r\n     in the infinite world of tones, he was transported also above\r\n     all earthly things;--his spirit had burst all restricting bonds,\r\n     shaken off the yoke of servitude, and soared triumphantly and\r\n     jubilantly into the luminous spaces of the higher æther. Now\r\n     his playing tore along like a wildly foaming cataract, and the\r\n     conjurer constrained his instrument to an utterance so forceful\r\n     that the stoutest structure was scarcely able to withstand it; and\r\n     anon he sank down, exhausted, exhaling gentle plaints, dissolving\r\n     in melancholy. Again the spirit would soar aloft, triumphing over\r\n     transitory terrestrial sufferings, turn its glance upward in\r\n     reverent sounds and find rest and comfort on the innocent bosom\r\n     of holy nature. But who shall sound the depths of the sea? It was\r\n     the mystical Sanscrit language whose hieroglyphs can be read only\r\n     by the initiated. Wölffl, on the contrary, trained in the school\r\n     of Mozart, was always equable; never superficial but always clear\r\n     and thus more accessible to the multitude. He used art only as\r\n     a means to an end, never to exhibit his acquirements. He always\r\n     enlisted the interest of his hearers and inevitably compelled them\r\n     to follow the progression of his well-ordered ideas. Whoever has\r\n     heard Hummel will know what is meant by this....\r\n\r\n     But for this (the attitude of their patrons) the _protégés_ cared\r\n     very little. They respected each other because they knew best how\r\n     to appreciate each other, and as straightforward honest Germans\r\n     followed the principle that the roadway of art is broad enough for\r\n     many, and that it is not necessary to lose one’s self in envy in\r\n     pushing forward for the goal of fame!\r\n\r\nWölffl proved his respect for his rival by dedicating to “M. L.\r\nvan Beethoven” the pianoforte sonatas, Op. 7, which were highly\r\ncommended in the “Allg. Mus. Zeit.” of Leipsic of January, 1799.\r\nAnother interesting and valuable discussion of Beethoven’s powers and\r\ncharacteristics as a pianoforte virtuoso at this period is contained\r\nin the autobiography of Tomaschek, who heard him both in public and in\r\nprivate during a visit which Beethoven made again this year to Prague.\r\nTomaschek was then both in age (he was born on April 17, 1774) and in\r\nmusical culture competent to form an independent judgment on such a\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nTOMASCHEK ON BEETHOVEN’S PLAYING\r\n\r\n     In the year 1798, says Tomaschek (unfortunately without giving any\r\n     clue to the time of the year), in which I continued my juridical\r\n     studies, Beethoven, the giant among pianoforte players, came to\r\n     Prague. He gave a largely attended concert in the Konviktssaal, at\r\n     which he played his Concerto in C major, Op. 15, and the Adagio\r\n     and graceful Rondo in A major from Op. 2, and concluded with an\r\n     improvisation on a theme given him by Countess Sch... (Schick?),\r\n     “Ah tu fosti il primo oggetto,” from Mozart’s “Titus” (duet No.\r\n     7). Beethoven’s magnificent playing and particularly the daring\r\n     flights in his improvisation stirred me strangely to the depths\r\n     of my soul; indeed I found myself so profoundly bowed down that\r\n     I did not touch my pianoforte for several days.... I heard\r\n     Beethoven at his second concert, which neither in performance nor\r\n     in composition renewed again the first powerful impression. This\r\n     time he played the Concerto in B-flat which he had just composed\r\n     in Prague.[83] Then I heard him a third time at the home of\r\n     Count C., where he played, besides the graceful Rondo from the A\r\n     major Sonata, an improvisation on the theme: “Ah! vous dirai-je,\r\n     Maman.” This time I listened to Beethoven’s artistic work with\r\n     more composure. I admired his powerful and brilliant playing,\r\n     but his frequent daring deviations from one motive to another,\r\n     whereby the organic connection, the gradual development of idea\r\n     was put aside, did not escape me. Evils of this nature frequently\r\n     weaken his greatest compositions, those which sprang from a too\r\n     exuberant conception. It is not seldom that the unbiassed listener\r\n     is rudely awakened from his transport. The singular and original\r\n     seemed to be his chief aim in composition, as is confirmed by\r\n     the answer which he made to a lady who asked him if he often\r\n     attended Mozart’s operas. “I do not know them,” he replied, “and\r\n     do not care to hear the music of others lest I forfeit some of my\r\n     originality.”\r\n\r\nThe veteran Tomaschek when he wrote thus had heard all the greatest\r\nvirtuosos of the pianoforte, who, from the days of Mozart to 1840, had\r\nmade themselves famous; and yet Beethoven remained for him still “the\r\nlord of pianoforte players” and “the giant among pianoforte players.”\r\nStill, great as he was now when Tomaschek heard him, Beethoven could\r\nwrite three years later that he had greatly perfected his playing.\r\n\r\nIt is only to be added to the history of the year 1798, that it is\r\nthe time in which Beethoven fixes the beginning of his deafness. Like\r\nit, the year 1799 offers, upon the whole, but scanty materials to the\r\nbiographers of Beethoven--standing in broad contrast to the next and,\r\nindeed all succeeding years, in which their quantity and variety become\r\na source of embarrassment.\r\n\r\nTwo new and valuable, though but passing acquaintances, were made by\r\nBeethoven this year, however--with Domenico Dragonetti, the greatest\r\ncontrabassist known to history, and John Baptist Cramer, one of\r\nthe greatest pianists. Dragonetti was not more remarkable for his\r\nastounding execution than for the deep, genuine musical feeling which\r\nelevated and ennobled it. He was now--the spring of 1799, so far as\r\nthe means are at hand of determining the time--returning to London\r\nfrom a visit to his native province, and his route taking him to\r\nVienna he remained there for several weeks. Beethoven and he soon met\r\nand they were mutually pleased with each other. Many years afterwards\r\nDragonetti related the following anecdote to Samuel Appleby, Esq., of\r\nBrighton, England: “Beethoven had been told that his new friend could\r\nexecute violoncello music upon his huge instrument, and one morning,\r\nwhen Dragonetti called at his room, he expressed his desire to hear a\r\nsonata. The contrabass was sent for, and the Sonata, No. 2, of Op. 5,\r\nwas selected. Beethoven played his part, with his eyes immovably fixed\r\nupon his companion, and, in the finale, where the arpeggios occur, was\r\nso delighted and excited that at the close he sprang up and threw his\r\narms around both player and instrument.” The unlucky contrabassists of\r\norchestras had frequent occasion during the next few years to know that\r\nthis new revelation of the powers and possibilities of their instrument\r\nto Beethoven, was not forgotten.\r\n\r\nCramer, born at Mannheim, 1771, but from early infancy reared\r\nand educated in England, was successively the pupil of the noted\r\nBensor, Schroeter and Clementi; but, like Beethoven, was in no small\r\ndegree self-taught. He was so rarely and at such long intervals on\r\nthe Continent that his extraordinary merits have never been fully\r\nunderstood and appreciated there. Yet for a period of many years in\r\nthe first part of the nineteenth century he was undoubtedly, upon the\r\nwhole, the first pianist of Europe, The object of his tour in 1799\r\nwas not to display his own talents and acquirements, but to add to\r\nhis general musical culture and to profit by his observations upon\r\nthe styles and peculiar characteristics of the great pianists of the\r\nContinent. In Vienna he renewed his intercourse with Haydn, whose prime\r\nfavorite he had been in England, and at once became extremely intimate\r\nwith Beethoven.\r\n\r\nCramer surpassed Beethoven in the perfect neatness, correctness and\r\nfinish of his execution; Beethoven assured him that he preferred his\r\ntouch to that of any other player; his brilliancy was astonishing;\r\nbut yet taste, feeling, expression, were the qualities which more\r\neminently distinguished him. Beethoven stood far above Cramer in power\r\nand energy, especially when extemporizing. Each was supreme in his\r\nown sphere; each found much to learn in the perfections of the other;\r\neach, in later years, did full justice to the other’s powers. Thus Ries\r\nsays: “Amongst the pianoforte players he [Beethoven] had praise for but\r\none as being distinguished--John Cramer. All others were but little\r\nto him.” On the other hand, Mr. Appleby, who knew Cramer well, was\r\nlong afterwards told by him, “No man in these days has heard extempore\r\nplaying, unless he has heard Beethoven.”\r\n\r\nCRAMER’S RECOLLECTIONS OF BEETHOVEN\r\n\r\nMaking a visit one morning to him, Cramer, as he entered the anteroom,\r\nheard Beethoven extemporizing by himself, and remained there more\r\nthan half an hour “completely entranced,” never in his life having\r\nheard such exquisite effects, such beautiful combinations. Knowing\r\nBeethoven’s extreme dislike to being listened to on such occasions,\r\nCramer retired and never let him know that he had so heard him.\r\n\r\nCramer’s widow communicates a pleasant anecdote. At an Augarten Concert\r\nthe two pianists were walking together and hearing a performance of\r\nMozart’s pianoforte Concerto in C minor (Köchel, No. 491); Beethoven\r\nsuddenly stood still and, directing his companion’s attention to\r\nthe exceedingly simple, but equally beautiful motive which is first\r\nintroduced towards the end of the piece, exclaimed: “Cramer, Cramer!\r\nwe shall never be able to do anything like that!” As the theme was\r\nrepeated and wrought up to the climax, Beethoven, swaying his body to\r\nand fro, marked the time and in every possible manner manifested a\r\ndelight rising to enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nSchindler’s record of his conversations upon Beethoven with Cramer\r\nand Cherubini in 1841 is interesting and valuable. He has, however,\r\nleft one important consideration unnoticed, namely, that the visits\r\nof those masters to Vienna were five years apart--five years of\r\ngreat change in Beethoven--a period during which his deafness, too\r\nslight to attract Cramer’s attention, had increased to a degree\r\nbeyond concealment, and which, joined to his increased devotion to\r\ncomposition and compulsory abandonment of all ambition as a virtuoso,\r\nwith consequent neglect of practice, had affected his execution\r\nunfavorably. Hence the difference in the opinions of such competent\r\njudges as Cramer, describing him as he was in 1799-1800, Cherubini in\r\n1805-6, and two years later Clementi, afford a doubtless just and fair\r\nindication of the decline of Beethoven’s powers as a mere pianist--not\r\nextending, however, at least for some years yet, to his extemporaneous\r\nperformances. We shall find from Ries and others ample confirmation of\r\nthe fact.\r\n\r\nAnd now let Schindler speak:\r\n\r\n     To the warm feeling of Cramer for Beethoven I owe the more\r\n     important matters.... Cherubini, disposed to be curt,\r\n     characterized Beethoven’s pianoforte playing in a single word:\r\n     “rough.” The gentleman Cramer, however, desired that less offence\r\n     be taken at the rudeness of his performance than at the unreliable\r\n     reading of one and the same composition--one day intellectually\r\n     brilliant and full of characteristic expression, the next freakish\r\n     to the verge of unclearness; often confused. (Which is confirmed\r\n     by Ries, Czerny and others.) Because of this a few friends\r\n     expressed a wish to hear Cramer play several works publicly from\r\n     the manuscript. This touched a sensitive spot in Beethoven; his\r\n     jealousy was aroused and, according to Cramer, their relations\r\n     became strained.\r\n\r\nThis strain, however, left no such sting behind it as to diminish\r\nCramer’s good opinion of Beethoven both as man and artist, or hinder\r\nhis free expression of it. To this fact the concurrent testimony of\r\nhis widow and son, and those enthusiasts for Beethoven Charles Neate,\r\nCipriani Potter and others who knew Cramer well, bear witness. It was\r\nthe conversation of Cramer about Beethoven which induced Potter, after\r\nthe fall of Napoleon, to journey to Vienna, to make the acquaintance of\r\nthe great master and, if possible, become his pupil.\r\n\r\nCramer’s musical gods were Handel and Mozart, notwithstanding his\r\nlife-long love for Bach’s clavier compositions; hence the abrupt\r\ntransitions, the strange modulations, and the, until then, unheard\r\npassages, which Beethoven introduced ever more freely into his\r\nworks--many of which have not yet found universal acceptance--were\r\nto him, as to Tomaschek and so many other of his contemporaries,\r\nimperfections and distortions of compositions, which but for them were\r\nmodels of beauty and harmonious proportion. He once gave this feeling\r\nutterance with comic exaggeration, when Potter, then a youth, was\r\nextolling some abstruse combinations, by saying: “If Beethoven emptied\r\nhis inkstand upon a piece of music paper you would admire it!”\r\n\r\nUpon Beethoven’s demeanor in society, Schindler proceeds thus:\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN’S DEMEANOR IN SOCIETY\r\n\r\n     The communications of both (Cramer and Madame Cherubini) agreed\r\n     in saying that in mixed society his conduct was reserved, stiff\r\n     and marked by artist’s pride; whereas among his intimates he was\r\n     droll, lively, indeed, voluble at times, and fond of giving play\r\n     to all the arts of wit and sarcasm, not always wisely especially\r\n     in respect of political and social prejudices. To this the two\r\n     were able to add much concerning his awkwardness in taking hold\r\n     of such objects as glasses, coffee cups, etc., to which Master\r\n     Cherubini added the comment: “Toujours brusque.” These statements\r\n     confirmed what I had heard from his older friends touching the\r\n     social demeanor of Beethoven in general.\r\n\r\nCramer reached Vienna early in September, and remained there, according\r\nto Schindler, through the following winter; but he does not appear to\r\nhave given any public concerts, although, during the first month of\r\nhis stay, we learn from a newspaper, he “earned general and deserved\r\napplause by his playing.” It is needless to dwell upon the advantages\r\nto Beethoven of constant intercourse for several months with a master\r\nlike Cramer, whose noblest characteristics as pianist were the same as\r\nMozart’s, and precisely those in which Beethoven was deficient.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet us pass in review the compositions which had their origin in the\r\nyears 1798 and 1799. First of all come the three Trios for stringed\r\ninstruments, Op. 9. The exact date of their conception has not yet\r\nbeen determined, all that is positive being that Beethoven sold them\r\nto Traeg on March 16, 1798, and that the publisher’s announcement of\r\nthem appeared on July 21st of the same year. The only sketches for the\r\nTrios quoted by Nottebohm show them in connection with a sketch for\r\nthe last movement of the “Sonate pathétique,” which was published in\r\n1799; but this proves nothing. It may be easily imagined that Beethoven\r\ndesired to make more extended use of the experience gained in writing\r\nthe Trios, Op. 3, and that he therefore began sketching Op. 9 in 1796\r\nor 1797. Beethoven dedicated the works to Count Browne in words such\r\nas could hardly have been called forth by the present of a horse.\r\nPerhaps some future investigator will be able to show upon what grounds\r\nBeethoven in the dedication called Count Browne his “first Mæcenas,” a\r\ntitle better deserved by Prince Lichnowsky.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST TWO PIANOFORTE CONCERTOS\r\n\r\nThe first two concertos for pianoforte call for consideration here, for\r\nit was not until 1798 that they acquired the form in which they are\r\nnow known. That the Concerto in B-flat was the earlier of the two has\r\nbeen proved in a preceding chapter of this volume. It was this Concerto\r\nand not the one in C major (as Wegeler incorrectly reported) that was\r\nplayed in March, 1795. Wegeler’s error was due to the circumstance that\r\nthe Concerto in C was published first. Sketches for the Concerto in\r\nB-flat major are found among the exercises written for Albrechtsberger,\r\nsketches for the Sonata in E major (Op. 14, No. 1), and others for\r\na little quartet movement which was owned by M. Malherbe of Paris;\r\non this sheet occurs a short exercise with the remark “Contrapunto\r\nall’ottava” which points to the beginning of 1795 or even 1794. The\r\nsketch is an obviously early form of a passage in the free fantasia.\r\nThis agrees with the statement that on March 29, 1795, Beethoven played\r\na new concerto, the key of which is not indicated. It is most likely\r\nthat it was this in B-flat, since the one in C did not exist at the\r\ntime. Beethoven, it appears, played it a few times afterward in Vienna\r\nand then rewrote it. According to Tomaschek’s account he played the\r\nB-flat Concerto (expressly distinguished from that in C) in 1798, again\r\nin Prague. Tomaschek added, “which he had composed in Prague.” This is\r\nconfounding the original version with the revision, concerning which\r\nNottebohm gives information in his “Zweite Beethoveniana” on the basis\r\nof sketches which point to 1798. The fact of the revision is proved by\r\nBeethoven’s memoranda, such as “To remain as it was,” “From here on\r\neverything to remain as it was.” The revision of the first movement\r\nwas radical, and the entire work was apparently undertaken in view of\r\nan imminent performance, most likely that of Prague in 1798. It was\r\npublished by Hoffmeister und Kühnel and dedicated to Carl Nikl Edlen\r\nvon Nikelsberg.\r\n\r\nThat the Concerto in C was composed later than that in B-flat has been\r\nproved by Beethoven’s testimony as well as other external evidences\r\nand is confirmed by the few remaining sketches analyzed by Nottebohm.\r\nThey appear in connection with a sketch for the cadenza for the B-flat\r\nConcerto which, therefore, must have been finished when its companion\r\nwas begun. A sketch for a cadenza for the C major Concerto comes after\r\nsketches for the Sonata in D, Op. 10, No. 3, which was published in\r\n1798. This new concerto must, therefore, have been finished. According\r\nto the testimony of Tomaschek he played it in 1798 in the Konviktsaal\r\nin Prague. Schindler says he played it for the first time “in the\r\nspring of 1800 in the Kärnthnerthor-Theater,” but this concert is\r\nlikely to have been that of April 2nd, 1800, described by Hanslick\r\nin his “Geschichte des Concertwesens in Wien” (p. 127). Schindler\r\nevidently knew nothing of the performance in Prague and a confusion\r\nmust be at the bottom of Czerny’s statement that the Concerto was\r\nplayed in the Kärnthnerthor-Theater in 1801. The Concerto in C,\r\ndedicated to the Countess Odescalchi, _née_ Keglevich, was published\r\nby Mollo in Vienna in 1801. There are three cadenzas for the first\r\nmovement of the Concerto, the last two of which call for an extended\r\ncompass of the pianoforte and are thus shown to be of later date than\r\nthe first.\r\n\r\nTo these concertos must be added the Rondo in B-flat for Pianoforte\r\nand Orchestra found unfinished among Beethoven’s compositions and\r\npublished by Diabelli and Co. in 1829. Sonnleithner, on the authority\r\nof Diabelli, says it was completed by Czerny, who also filled out\r\nthe accompaniment. There is no authentic record of the time of its\r\ncomposition. O. Jahn surmised that it may have been designed for\r\nthe Concerto in B-flat. Its contents indicate an earlier period. A\r\nsketch printed by Nottebohm associated with a Romanza for Pianoforte,\r\nFlute and Bassoon, judged by the handwriting, is not of later date\r\nthan 1795. E. Mandyczewski compared the original manuscript, now in\r\nthe library of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, with the printed\r\nform and decided that the work was completed in plan and _motiri_\r\nby Beethoven, who, however, did not carry out the cadenzas and only\r\nindicated the passages. The share which Czerny had in it is thus\r\nindicated; he added the cadenzas and extended the pianoforte passages\r\nwhich Beethoven had only indicated, making them more effective and\r\nbrilliant. The use of the high registers of the pianoforte which Czerny\r\nemploys somewhat too freely in view of the simple character of the\r\npiece, was not contemplated by Beethoven, who once remarked of Czerny:\r\n“He uses the piccolo too much for me.” In Mandyczewski’s opinion the\r\nhandwriting points to a time before 1800, and the contents indicate\r\nthe early Vienna if not the Bonn period. Mandyczewski also thinks that\r\nthe romanza-like Andante is palpably a very early composition and\r\nthat the correspondence in key and measure with the B-flat Concerto\r\nmight indicate that it was originally designed as a part of that work,\r\na supposition which is strengthened by the fact that the original\r\nmanuscript is neither dated nor signed. This internal evidence has\r\nmuch in its favor, the more since it is not at all obvious what might\r\nhave prompted Beethoven to write an independent rondo for concert\r\nuse. There is no external evidence; if there were, the conception\r\nof the B-flat Concerto would have to be set at a much earlier date\r\nthan has yet been done. The first Vienna sketches for the Concerto,\r\nas Nottebohm shows, prove that the present three movements belonged\r\ntogether from the beginning. They were, therefore, surely played at the\r\nfirst performance in 1795. Nottebohm, who repeated Jahn’s surmise in\r\nhis “Thematisches Verzeichniss,” changed his mind after a study of the\r\nsketches and rejected the notion that the rondo had been designed for\r\nthe Concerto. Only by assuming an earlier date for the rondo can the\r\ntheory be upheld. Attention may here be called to Wegeler’s statement\r\n(“Notizen,” p. 56) that the rondo of the first Concerto (he says, of\r\ncourse, the Concerto in C) was not composed until the second afternoon\r\nbefore the performance. There may possibly have been another. This is\r\nnot necessarily disproved by the fact that sketches for the present\r\none were in existence. The question is not settled by the evidence now\r\nbefore us, but the probabilities are with Mandyczewski.\r\n\r\nNow begins the glorious series of sonatas. The first were the three\r\n(Op. 10) which, though begun in part at an earlier date, were\r\ndefinitively finished and published in 1798. Eder, the publisher,\r\nopened a subscription for them by an advertisement in the “Wiener\r\nZeitung,” July 5th, 1798; therefore they were finished at that time.\r\nThe sketching for them had begun in 1796, as appears from Nottebohm’s\r\nstatement,[84] and Beethoven worked on the three simultaneously.\r\nSketches for the first movement of the first Sonata are mixed with\r\nsketches for the soprano air for Umlauf’s “Schusterin” which have been\r\nattributed to 1796, and the Variations for three Wind-Instruments\r\nwhich were played in 1797. Sketches for the third sonata are found\r\namong notes for the Sextet for Wind-Instruments (composed about 1796)\r\nand also for the Concerto in C minor, which, therefore, was begun\r\nthus early, and for one of the seven country dances which appeared in\r\n1799, or perhaps earlier. The sketches for the last movement of No.\r\n3 are associated alone with sketches for a cadenza for the C major\r\nConcerto which Beethoven played in Prague in 1798, and may therefore be\r\nplaced in this year. It follows that the three sonatas were developed\r\ngradually in 1796-98, and completed in 1798. From the sketches and\r\nthe accompanying memoranda[85] we learn, furthermore, that for the\r\nfirst Sonata, which now has three movements, a fourth, an Intermezzo,\r\nwas planned on which Beethoven several times made a beginning but\r\npermitted to fall. Two of these movements became known afterwards as\r\n“Bagatelles.” We learn also that the last movement of the first Sonata,\r\nand the second movement of the second, were originally laid out on a\r\nlarger scale.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF THE “SONATE PATHÉTIQUE”\r\n\r\nThe “Sonate pathétique,” Op. 13, was published by Eder, in Vienna, in\r\n1799, and afterwards by Hoffmeister, who announced them on December 18\r\nof the same year. Sketches for the rondo are found among those for the\r\nTrio, Op. 9, and after the beginning of a fair copy of the Sonata, Op.\r\n49, No. 1. From this there is no larger deduction than that the Sonata\r\nprobably had its origin about 1798. One of the sketches, however,\r\nindicates that the last movement was originally conceived for more\r\nthan one instrument, probably for a sonata for pianoforte and violin.\r\nBeethoven published the two Sonatas, Op. 14, which he dedicated to\r\nthe Baroness Braun, immediately after the “Sonate pathétique.” They\r\ncame from the press of Mollo and were announced on December 21, 1799.\r\nThe exact time of their composition cannot be determined definitely.\r\nUp to the present time no sketches for the second are known to exist;\r\ncopious ones for the first, however, are published by Nottebohm in his\r\n“Zweite Beethoveniana” (p. 45 _et seq._), some of which appear before\r\nsketches for the Sonata, Op. 12, No. 3, then approaching completion,\r\nand some after sketches for the Concerto in B-flat. Because of this\r\njuxtaposition, Nottebohm places the conception of the Sonata in 1795.\r\n\r\nTouching the history of the Trio, Op. 11, for Pianoforte, Clarinet and\r\nVioloncello, little is known. It was advertised as wholly new by Mollo\r\nand Co. on October 3, 1798, and is inscribed to the Countess Thun.\r\nSketches associated with works that are unknown or were never completed\r\nare in the British Museum and set forth by Nottebohm in his “Zweite\r\nBeethoveniana” (p. 515). The sketch for the Adagio resembles the\r\nbeginning of the minuet in the Sonata, Op. 49, No. 2, and is changed\r\nlater; this points approximately to 1798. The last movement consists\r\nof a series of variations on the theme of a trio from Weigl’s opera\r\n“L’Amor marinaro,” beginning “Pria ch’io l’impegno.” Weigl’s opera was\r\nperformed for the first time on October 15, 1797. Czerny told Otto\r\nJahn that Beethoven took the theme at the request of a clarinet player\r\n(Beer?) for whom he wrote the Trio. The elder Artaria told Cipriani\r\nPotter in 1797, that he had given the theme to Beethoven and requested\r\nhim to introduce variations on it into a trio, and added that Beethoven\r\ndid not know that the melody was Weigl’s until after the Trio was\r\nfinished, whereupon he grew very angry on finding it out. Czerny says\r\nin the supplement to his “Pianoforte School”:\r\n\r\n     It was at the wish of the clarinet player for whom Beethoven wrote\r\n     this Trio that he employed the above theme by Weigl (which was\r\n     then very popular) as the finale. At a later period he frequently\r\n     contemplated writing another concluding movement for this Trio,\r\n     and letting the variations stand as a separate work.\r\n\r\nIf Czerny is correct in his statement, obvious deductions from it are\r\nthese, which are scarcely consistent with Artaria’s story: if the\r\ntheme was “very popular” at the time the opera must have had several\r\nperformances, and it is not likely that the melody was unfamiliar to\r\nBeethoven, who also, it may be assumed, wrote the title of Weigl’s\r\ntrio, which is printed at the beginning of the last movement of\r\nBeethoven’s composition. Beethoven produced the Trio for the first time\r\nat the house of Count Fries on the occasion of his first meeting with\r\nSteibelt. The three Sonatas for Pianoforte and Violin, Op. 12, were\r\nadvertised in the “Wiener Zeitung” of January 12, 1799, as published by\r\nArtaria, which would seem to place their origin in 1798. The program of\r\na concert given by Madame Duschek on March 29, 1798, preserved in the\r\narchives of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, announces a sonata with\r\naccompaniment to be played by Beethoven. The accompanying (_obbligato_)\r\ninstrument is not mentioned, but the work may well have been one of\r\nthese Sonatas. Nottebohm discusses the juxtaposition of sketches for\r\nthe second Sonata with sketches for the Pianoforte Concerto in B-flat\r\nand the sonata in E, Op. 14, No. 1, and is inclined to fix 1795 as\r\nthe year of the sonata’s origin. But we are in the dark as to whether\r\nthe sketches for the Pianoforte Concerto were for its original or its\r\nrevised form.\r\n\r\nAmong the instrumental compositions of this year belong the Variations\r\nfor Pianoforte and Violoncello on “Ein Mädchen oder Weibchen” from\r\nMozart’s “Zauberflöte,” of which nothing more is known than that Traeg\r\nannounced their publication on September 12, 1798. They were afterward\r\ntaken over by Artaria. The Variation for Pianoforte on a theme from\r\nGrétry’s “Richard, Cœur de Lion” (“Une fièvre brûlante”) were announced\r\nas newly published on November 7, 1798, by Traeg; Cappi and Diabelli\r\nacquired them later. Sketches for them are found by the side of\r\nsketches for the first movement of the Sonata in C minor, Op. 10, No.\r\n1, which circumstance indicates that 1796 was the year of their origin.\r\nAccording to Sonnleithner, “Richard, Cœur de Lion” was first performed\r\nat the Hoftheater, Vienna, on January 7, 1788; then again on June 13,\r\n1799 in the Theater auf den Wieden; but a ballet, “Richard Löwenherz,”\r\nby Vigano, music by Weigl, in which Grétry’s romance, “Une fièvre\r\nbrûlante,” was interpolated, was brought forward on July 2, 1795, in\r\nthe Hof- und Nationaltheater and repeated often in that year, and it\r\nwas thence, no doubt, that the suggestion for the variations came to\r\nBeethoven. The six little Variations on a Swiss air were published,\r\naccording to Nottebohm, by Simrock in Bonn in 1798. The ten Variations\r\non “La stessa, la stessissima” from Salieri’s “Falstaff, ossia le tre\r\nBurle,” were announced as just published in the “Wiener Zeitung” of\r\nMarch 2, 1799. Salieri’s opera was performed on January 3 (Wlassak\r\nsays January 6), 1799, in the Hoftheater; Beethoven’s, therefore,\r\nwas an occasional composition conceived and produced in a very short\r\ntime. Sketches are found among some for the first Quartet, Op. 18, and\r\nothers. The Variations are dedicated to the Countess Babette Keglevich.\r\nTwice more in the same year operatic productions induced similar\r\nworks. The publication of the Variations on “Kind, willst du ruhig\r\nschlafen?” from Winter’s “Unterbrochenes Opferfest,” was announced in\r\nthe “Wiener Zeitung” of December 21, 1799, by Mollo and Co.; the opera\r\nhad its first performance in Vienna on June 15, 1796, and was repeated\r\nfrequently within the years immediately following--six times in 1799.\r\nIn this case also it may be assumed that publication followed hard on\r\nthe heels of composition. Sketches are found in companionship with\r\nothers belonging to the Quartet, Op. 18, No. 5, and the Septet. The\r\nVariations on “Tändeln und Scherzen,” from Süssmayr’s opera “Soliman\r\nII, oder die drei Sultaninnen,” belong to the same time. The opera was\r\nperformed on October 1, 1799, in the Hoftheater; the publication of\r\nthe variations by Hoffmeister was announced in the “Wiener Zeitung”\r\non December 18, 1799. They may have been printed previously by Eder.\r\nThey were dedicated to Countess Browne, _née_ von Bietinghoff. It is\r\ninteresting to learn from Czerny that these Variations were the first\r\nof Beethoven’s compositions which the master gave him to study when he\r\nbecame his pupil. Before them he had pieces by C. P. E. Bach and after\r\nthem the “Sonate pathéthique.”\r\n\r\nTHE PERIOD OF THE FIRST SYMPHONY\r\n\r\nAs evidence pointing to the period in which the first Symphony was\r\nwritten we have, first of all, the report of the first performance\r\non April 2, 1800; but inasmuch as the copying of the parts and the\r\nrehearsals must have consumed a considerable time, the period would be\r\nmuch too short (especially in view of Beethoven’s method of working) if\r\nwe were also to assume that the Symphony originated in 1800. It is very\r\nlikely that, with the Quartets, it was sketched at an earlier period\r\nand worked out in the main by 1799 at the latest. It was published\r\ntoward the end of 1801 by Hoffmeister and Kühnel as Op. 21, dedicated\r\nto Baron van Swieten and advertised in the “Wiener Zeitung” of January\r\n16, 1802. Beethoven had already planned a symphony while studying with\r\nAlbrechtsberger. Nottebohm reports on his purposes after a study of\r\nsome sketches and from him we learn that the theme of the present last\r\nmovement was originally intended for a first movement. Beethoven must\r\nhave worked on this composition in 1794-’95, perhaps at the suggestion\r\nof van Swieten--a conclusion suggested by the fact that the dedication\r\nof the first symphony went to him. Beethoven abandoned this early plan\r\nand turned to other ideas for the new symphony, but there is no clue\r\nas to the precise time when this was done. In 1802, Mollo published\r\nan arrangement of the symphony as a quintet at the same time that\r\nHoffmeister and Kühnel published a like arrangement of the Septet.\r\nBeethoven published the following protest in the “Wiener Zeitung” of\r\nOctober 20, 1802:\r\n\r\n     I believe that I owe it to the public and myself publicly to\r\n     announce that the two Quintets in C major and E-flat major, of\r\n     which the first (taken from a symphony of mine) has been published\r\n     by Mr. Mollo in Vienna, and the second (taken from my familiar\r\n     Septet, Op. 20) by Mr. Hoffmeister in Leipzig, are not original\r\n     quintets but transcriptions prepared by the publishers. The\r\n     making of transcriptions at the best is a matter against which\r\n     (in this prolific day of such things) an author must protest in\r\n     vain; but it is possible at least to demand of the publishers\r\n     that they indicate the fact on the title-page, so that the honor\r\n     of the author may not be lessened and the public be not deceived.\r\n     This much to hinder such things in the future. At the same time\r\n     I announce that a new Quintet of mine in C major, Op. 29, will\r\n     shortly be published by Breitkopf and Härtel in Leipzig.\r\n\r\nMention may here be made in conclusion of the two French songs, “Que\r\nle temps (jour) me dure” (Rousseau) and “Plaisir d’aimer,” recovered\r\nfrom sketches and described by Jean Chantavoine in “Die Musik” (Vol.\r\nI, No. 12, 1902). The origin of the latter is fixed in 1799, by its\r\nassociation with a sketch for the Quartets, Op. 18.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[83] It will be seen in a letter of Beethoven’s that this concerto was\r\nin fact composed before that in C major; but it is not improbable that\r\nthe last movement was written in Prague.\r\n\r\n[84] “Zweite Beethoveniana,” p. 29 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[85] Among sketches for the second movement of the Quintet, Op.\r\n16, Beethoven wrote: “For the new sonatas very short minuets. The\r\nScherzo remains for that in C minor.” And in another sketch he\r\nwrites: “Intermezzo for the sonata in C minor.”--Nottebohm, “Zweite\r\nBeethoveniana,” 32, 479.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI\r\n\r\n     Beethoven’s Social Life in Vienna--His Friends: Vogl,\r\n     Kiesewetter, Zmeskall, Amenda, Count Lichnowsky, Eppinger,\r\n     Krumpholz--Schuppanzigh and His Quartet--Hummel--Friendships with\r\n     Women--His Dedications.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chronological progress of the narrative must again be interrupted\r\nfor a chapter or two, since no picture of a man’s life can be complete\r\nwithout the lights or shades arising from his social relations--without\r\nsome degree of knowledge respecting those with whom he is on terms of\r\nequality and intimacy and whose company he most affects. The attempt\r\nto draw such a picture in the case of Beethoven, that is, during his\r\nfirst years in Vienna, leaves much to be desired, for, although the\r\nsearch for materials has not been very unsuccessful, many of the data\r\nare but vague and scattered notices. In a Conversation Book, bearing\r\nBeethoven’s own date “on the 20th of March, 1820,” some person unknown\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n     Do you want to know where I first had the honor and good fortune\r\n     to see you? More than 25 years ago I lived with Frank of Prague in\r\n     the Drachengassel in the old Fish Market. Several noblemen, for\r\n     instance His Excellency van B. Cristen (?), Heinerle, Vogl (now a\r\n     singer), Kösswetter, basso, now Court Councillor, Greyenstein (?),\r\n     has long been living in France, etc. There we often\r\n\r\n    musicicised, etc.\r\n    supperized, etc.\r\n    punchized, etc.\r\n\r\n     and at the conclusion Your Excellency often rejoiced us at _my_\r\n     P. F. I was then Court Councillor in the War Office (?). I have\r\n     practised since then at least 15 thousand métiers--Did we meet\r\n     in Prague? In what year?--1796--3 days--I was in Prague also in\r\n     1790-1-2.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the portions of this Conversation Book, copied\r\nfor this work, to show who this man of “15 thousand métiers” was,\r\nnow sitting with Beethoven in an eating-house, and recalling to his\r\nmemory the frolics of his first year and a quarter in Vienna; nor are\r\nHeinerle, Cristen, Greyenstein and Frank of Prague sufficiently known\r\nto fame as to be now identified; but Johann Michael Vogl, less than two\r\nyears older than Beethoven, was afterward a very celebrated tenor of\r\nthe opera. In 1793-4 he was still pursuing the study of jurisprudence,\r\nwhich he abandoned in 1795 for the stage. May not this early friendship\r\nfor Beethoven have been among the causes of the resuscitation of\r\n“Fidelio” in 1814, for the benefit performance of Vogl, Saal and\r\nWeinmüller?\r\n\r\nThere is a story, first put in circulation by a certain August Barth,\r\nto the effect that the singer of that name once finding Beethoven\r\nemployed in burning a mass of musical and other papers, sang one vocal\r\npiece thus destined to destruction, was pleased with it, and saved\r\nthe immortal “Adelaide!” The story is sufficiently refuted by the\r\nfact that when Barth first came to Vienna, in 1807, the “Adelaide”\r\nhad been in print some ten years. If the name Vogl be substituted in\r\nthe tale, there may, perhaps, be so much truth in it as this: that\r\nhe was consulted upon the merits of the composition by Beethoven,\r\napproved it, and first sang it and made it known--as he was the first,\r\nyears afterwards, to sing in public the “Erlkönig” and other fine\r\nproductions of Franz Schubert. The “Kösswetter, basso,” was Raphael\r\nGeorge Kiesewetter, who lived to be renowned as a writer upon topics\r\nof musical history, and to play a part in the revival of ancient music\r\nin Vienna, not less noteworthy than that of Thibaut in Heidelberg.\r\nAt the period of the “music-making, supping and punch drinking” by\r\nthe “noblemen” in the apartments of Frank of Prague, Kiesewetter\r\nwas a young man of twenty, engaged, like Vogl, in the study of the\r\nlaw. In the spring of 1794--and thus the date of these meetings is\r\ndetermined--he received an appointment in the military chancellary,\r\nand went at once to the headquarters at Schwetzingen on the Rhine.\r\nMore important and valuable during these years, as subsequently, was\r\nthe warm, sincere friendship of Nicolaus Zmeskall von Domanovecz, an\r\nofficial in the Royal Hungarian Court Chancellary. “You belong to my\r\nearliest friends in Vienna,” writes Beethoven in 1816. Zmeskall, to\r\nquote the words of Sonnleithner,\r\n\r\n     was an expert violoncellist, a sound and tasteful composer. Too\r\n     modest to publish his compositions, he willed them to the archives\r\n     of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde. After personal examination\r\n     I can only give assurance that his three string quartets would\r\n     entitle him to an honorable place among masters of the second\r\n     rank, and are more deserving to be heard than many new things\r\n     which, for all manner of reasons, we are compelled to hear.\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN’S REGARD FOR ZMESKALL\r\n\r\nThat Zmeskall was a very constant attendant at the musical parties of\r\nPrince Carl Lichnowsky and frequently took part in them, may be seen\r\nfrom Wegeler’s record. He was ten years older than Beethoven, had been\r\nlong enough in Vienna to know the best society there, into which he was\r\nadmitted not more because of his musical attainments than because of\r\nthe respectability of his position and character; and was, therefore,\r\nwhat the young student-pianist needed most, a friend, who at the same\r\ntime could be to a certain degree an authoritative adviser, and at\r\nall times was a judicious one. On the part of Zmeskall there was an\r\ninstant and hearty appreciation of the extraordinary powers of the\r\nyoung stranger from the Rhine and a clear anticipation of his splendid\r\nartistic future. A singular proof of this is the care with which he\r\npreserved the most insignificant scraps of paper, if Beethoven had\r\nwritten a few words upon them; for, certainly, no other motive could\r\nhave induced him to save many notes of this kind and of no importance\r\nten, fifteen, twenty years, as may be seen in the published letters\r\nof the composer. On the part of Beethoven, there was sincere respect\r\nfor the dignity and gravity of Zmeskall’s character, which usually\r\nrestrained him within proper limits in their personal intercourse; but\r\nhe delighted, especially in the earlier period, to give, in his notes\r\nand letters, full play to his queer fancies and sometimes extravagant\r\nhumour.\r\n\r\nHere are a few examples in point:\r\n\r\n     To His Well Well Highest and Bestborn, the Herr von Zmeskall,\r\n     Imperial and Royal as also Royal and Imperial Court Secretary:\r\n\r\n     Will His High and Wellborn, His Herrn von Zmeskall’s Zmeskallity\r\n     have the kindness to say where we can speak to him to-morrow?\r\n\r\n    We are your most damnably\r\n    devoted\r\n\r\n    Beethoven.\r\n\r\n    My dearest Baron Muckcartdriver.\r\n\r\n     _Je vous suis bien obligé pour votre faiblesse de vos yeux._\r\n     Moreover I forbid you henceforth to rob me of the good\r\n     humor into which I occasionally fall, for yesterday your\r\n     Zmeskall-damanovitzian chatter made me melancholy. The devil\r\n     take you; I want none of your moral (precepts) for Power is the\r\n     morality of men who loom above the others, and it is also mine;\r\n     and if you begin again to-day I’ll torment you till you agree that\r\n     everything that I do is good and praiseworthy (for I am going to\r\n     the Swan--the Ox would be preferable, yet this rests with your\r\n     Zmeskallian Domanovezian decision (_résponse_).\r\n\r\n    Adieu Baron Ba...ron, ~ron / nor / orn / rno / onr /~\r\n    (_voilà quelque chose_ from the old pawnshop.)\r\n\r\nMechanical skill was never so developed in Beethoven that he could make\r\ngood pens from goose quills--and the days of other pens were not yet.\r\nWhen, therefore, he had no one with him to aid him in this, he usually\r\nsent to Zmeskall for a supply. Of the large number of such applications\r\npreserved by his friend and now scattered in all civilized lands as\r\nautographs, here are two specimens.\r\n\r\n     Best of Music Counts! I beg of you to send me one or a few pens\r\n     of which I am really in great need. As soon as I learn where real\r\n     good, and admirable pens are to be found I will buy some of them.\r\n     I hope to see you at the Swan today.\r\n\r\n    Adieu, most precious\r\n    Music Count\r\n    yours etc.\r\n\r\n     His Highness von Z. is commanded to hasten a bit with the plucking\r\n     out of a few of his quills (among them, no doubt, some not his\r\n     own). It is hoped that they may not be too tightly grown. As soon\r\n     as you have done all that we shall ask we shall be, with excellent\r\n     esteem your\r\n\r\n    F----\r\n    Beethoven.\r\n\r\nHad Zmeskall not carefully treasured these notes, they would never have\r\nmet any eye but his own; it is evident, therefore, that he entered\r\nfully into their humor, and that it was the same to him, whether he\r\nfound himself addressed as “Baron,” “Count,” “Cheapest Baron,” “Music\r\nCount,” “Baron Muckcartdriver,” “His Zmeskallian Zmeskallity,” or\r\nsimply “Dear Z.”--which last is the more usual. He knew his man, and\r\nloved him; and these “quips and quiddities” were received in the spirit\r\nwhich begat them. The whole tenor of the correspondence between the two\r\nshows that Zmeskall had more influence for good upon Beethoven than any\r\nother of his friends; he could reprove him for faults, and check him\r\nwhen in the wrong, without producing a quarrel more serious than the\r\none indicated in the protest, above given, against interrupting his\r\n“good humor.”\r\n\r\nAs a musician, as well as man and friend, Zmeskall stood high\r\nin Beethoven’s esteem. His apartments, No. 1166, in that huge\r\nconglomeration of buildings known as the Bürgerspital, were for a\r\nlong series of years the scene of a private morning concert, to which\r\nonly the first performers of chamber music and a very few guests were\r\nadmitted. Here, after the rupture with Prince Lichnowsky, Beethoven’s\r\nproductions of this class were usually first tried over. Not until\r\nBeethoven’s death did their correspondence cease.\r\n\r\nESTEEM AND AFFECTION FOR AMENDA\r\n\r\nAnother young man who gained an extraordinary place in Beethoven’s\r\nesteem and affection, and who departed from Vienna before anything\r\noccurred to cause a breach between them, was a certain Karl Amenda,\r\nfrom the shore of the Baltic, who died some forty years later as\r\nProvost in Courland. He was a good violinist, belonged to the circle of\r\ndilettanti which Beethoven so much affected, and, on parting, received\r\nfrom the composer one of his first attempts at quartet composition. His\r\nname most naturally suggests itself to fill the blank in a letter to\r\nRies, July, 1804, wherein some living person, not named, is mentioned\r\nas one with whom he (Beethoven) “never had a misunderstanding,” but\r\nhe adds “although we have known nothing of each other for nearly six\r\nyears,” which was not true of Amenda, since letters passed between\r\nthem in 1801. The small portion of their written correspondence which\r\nhas been made public shows that their friendship was of the romantic\r\ncharacter once so much the fashion; and a letter of Amenda is filled\r\nwith incense which in our day would bear the name of almost too gross\r\nflattery. But times change and tastes with them. His name appears once\r\nin the Zmeskall correspondence, namely, in a mutilated note now in the\r\nRoyal Imperial Court Library, beginning “My cheapest Baron! Tell the\r\nguitarist to come to me to-day. Amenda is to make an _Amende_ (part\r\ntorn away) which he deserves for his bad pauses (torn) provide the\r\nguitarist.”\r\n\r\nKarl Amenda was born on October 4, 1771, at Lippaiken in Courland. He\r\nstudied music with his father and Chapelmaster Beichtmer, was so good\r\na violinist that he was able to give a concert at 14 years of age, and\r\ncontinued his musical studies after he was matriculated as a student\r\nof theology at the University of Jena. After a three years’ course\r\nthere he set out on a tour, and reached Vienna in the spring of 1798.\r\nThere he first became precentor for Prince Lobkowitz and afterward\r\nmusic-teacher in the family of Mozart’s widow. How, thereupon, he\r\nbecame acquainted with Beethoven we are able to report from a document\r\nstill in the possession of the family, which bears the superscription\r\n“Brief Account of the Friendly Relations between L. v. Beethoven and\r\nKarl Friedrich Amenda, afterward Provost at Talsen in Courland, written\r\ndown from oral tradition”:\r\n\r\n     After the completion of his theological studies K. F. Amenda\r\n     goes to Vienna, where he several times meets Beethoven at the\r\n     table d’hôte, attempts to enter into conversation with him, but\r\n     without success, since Beeth. remains very _réservé_. After some\r\n     time Amenda, who meanwhile had become music-teacher at the home\r\n     of Mozart’s widow, receives an invitation from a friendly family\r\n     and there plays first violin in a quartet. While he was playing\r\n     somebody turned the pages for him, and when he turned about at\r\n     the finish he was frightened to see Beethoven, who had taken the\r\n     trouble to do this and now withdrew with a bow. The next day the\r\n     extremely amiable host at the evening party appeared and cried\r\n     out: “What have you done? You have captured Beethoven’s heart!\r\n     B. requests that you rejoice him with your company.” A., much\r\n     pleased, hurries to B., who at once asks him to play with him.\r\n     This is done and when, after several hours, A. takes his leave,\r\n     B. accompanies him to his quarters, where there was music again.\r\n     As B. finally prepared to go he said to A.: “I suppose you can\r\n     accompany me.” This is done, and B. kept A. till evening and went\r\n     with him to his home late at night. From that time the mutual\r\n     visits became more and more numerous and the two took walks\r\n     together, so that the people in the streets when they saw only\r\n     one of them in the street at once called out: “Where is the other\r\n     one?” A. also introduced Mylich, with whom he had come to Vienna,\r\n     to B., and Mylich often played trios with B. and A. His instrument\r\n     was the second violin or viola. Once when B. heard that Mylich\r\n     had a sister in Courland who played the pianoforte prettily, he\r\n     handed him a sonata in manuscript with the inscription: “To the\r\n     sister of my good friend Mylich.” The manuscript was rolled up and\r\n     tied with a little silk ribbon. B. complained that he could not\r\n     get along on the violin. Asked by A. to try it, nevertheless, he\r\n     played so fearfully that A. had to call out: “Have mercy--quit!”\r\n     B. quit playing and the two laughed till they had to hold their\r\n     sides. One evening B. improvised marvellously on the pianoforte\r\n     and at the close A. said: “It is a great pity that such glorious\r\n     music is born and lost in a moment.” Whereupon B.: “There you\r\n     are mistaken; I can repeat every extemporization”; whereupon he\r\n     sat himself down and played it again without a change. B. was\r\n     frequently embarrassed for money. Once he complained to A.; he had\r\n     to pay rent and had no idea how he could do it. “That’s easily\r\n     remedied,” said A. and gave him a theme (“Freudvoll und Leidvoll”)\r\n     and locked him in his room with the remark that he must make a\r\n     beginning on the variations within three hours. When A. returns he\r\n     finds B. on the spot but ill-tempered. To the question whether or\r\n     not he had begun B. handed over a paper with the remark: “There’s\r\n     your stuff!” (_Da ist der Wisch!_) A. takes the notes joyfully to\r\n     B.’s landlord and tells him to take it to a publisher, who would\r\n     pay him handsomely for it. The landlord hesitated at first but\r\n     finally decided to do the errand and, returning joyfully, asks\r\n     if other bits of paper like that were to be had. But in order\r\n     definitely to relieve such financial needs A. advised B. to make a\r\n     trip to Italy. B. says he is willing but only on condition that A.\r\n     go with him. A. agrees gladly and the trip is practically planned.\r\n     Unfortunately news of a death calls A. back to his home. His\r\n     brother has been killed in an accident and the duty of caring for\r\n     the family devolves on him. With doubly oppressed heart A. takes\r\n     leave of B. to return to his home in Courland. There he receives\r\n     a letter from B. saying: “Since you cannot go along, I shall not\r\n     go to Italy.” Later the friends frequently exchanged thoughts by\r\n     correspondence.[86]\r\n\r\nThough, as we have learned, it was music which brought Beethoven into\r\ncontact with Amenda, it was the latter’s amiability and nobility of\r\ncharacter that endeared him to the composer, who cherished him as one\r\nof his dearest friends and confided things to him which he concealed\r\nfrom his other intimates--his deafness, for instance. A striking proof\r\nof Beethoven’s affection is offered by the fact that he gave Amenda a\r\ncopy of his Quartet in F (Op. 18, No. 1), writing on the first violin\r\npart:\r\n\r\n     Dear Amenda: Take this quartet as a small memorial of our\r\n     friendship, and whenever you play it recall the days which we\r\n     passed together and the sincere affection felt for you then and\r\n     which will always be felt by\r\n\r\n    Your true and warm friend\r\n    Ludwig van Beethoven.\r\n\r\n    Vienna, 1799, June 25.\r\n\r\nIn a letter written nearly a year later Beethoven asks his friend\r\nnot to lend the quartet, as he had revised it. A letter written,\r\nevidently, about the time of Amenda’s departure from Vienna indicated\r\nthat Beethoven was oppressed at this period with another grief than\r\nthat caused by the loss of his friend’s companionship. Beethoven speaks\r\nof his “already lacerated heart,” says that “the worst of the storm\r\nis over” and mentions an invitation to Poland--which he had accepted.\r\nNothing came of this Polish enterprise. Dr. A. C. Kalischer suspected\r\nthat the lacerated heart was due to the composer’s unrequited love for\r\nMagdalena Willmann, a singer then in Vienna to whom he made a proposal\r\nof marriage which was never answered.\r\n\r\nFRIENDSHIP WITH COUNT LICHNOWSKY\r\n\r\nCount Moritz Lichnowsky, brother of Prince Carl, of whom we shall\r\nnot lose sight entirely until the closing scene, was another of the\r\nfriends of those years. He had been a pupil of Mozart, played the\r\npianoforte with much skill and was an influential member of the party\r\nwhich defended the novelty and felt the grandeur of his friend’s\r\ncompositions. Schindler saw much of him during Beethoven’s last years,\r\nand eulogizes the “noble Count” in very strong terms.\r\n\r\nAnother of that circle of young dilettanti, and one of the first\r\nplayers of Beethoven’s compositions, was a young Jewish violinist,\r\nHeinrich Eppinger. He played at a charity concert in Vienna, making\r\nhis first appearance there in 1789. “He became, in after years,” says\r\na correspondent of the time, “a dilettante of the most excellent\r\nreputation, lived modestly on a small fortune and devoted himself\r\nentirely to music.” At the period before us Eppinger was one of\r\nBeethoven’s first violins at the private concerts of the nobility.\r\nHäring, who became a distinguished merchant and banker, belonged now to\r\nthis circle of young amateur musicians, and in 1795 had the reputation\r\nof being at the head of the amateur violinists. The youthful friendship\r\nbetween him and the composer was not interrupted as they advanced into\r\nlife, and twenty years later was of great advantage to Beethoven.\r\n\r\nBut a more interesting person for us is the instructor under whom\r\nBeethoven in Vienna resumed his study of the violin (a fact happily\r\npreserved by Ries)--Wenzel Krumpholz. He was a brother of the very\r\ncelebrated Bohemian harp player who drowned himself in the Seine in\r\n1790. In his youth Krumpholz had been for a period of three years a\r\npupil of Haydn at Esterhaz and had played first violin in the orchestra\r\nthere. He left Esterhaz to enter the service of Prince Kinsky, but came\r\nto Vienna in 1795 to join the operatic orchestra, and at once became\r\nnoted as a performer in Haydn’s quartets. He was (says Eugene Eiserle\r\nin Glöggl’s “Neue Wiener Musik-Zeitung” of August 13, 1857),\r\n\r\n     a highly sensitive art-enthusiast, and one of the first of those\r\n     who foresaw and recognized Beethoven’s greatness. He attached\r\n     himself to Beethoven with such pertinacity and self-sacrifice\r\n     that the latter, though he always called him “his fool,” accepted\r\n     him as “a most intimate friend,” made him acquainted with all his\r\n     plans for compositions and generally reposed the utmost confidence\r\n     in him. Krumpholz formed also an exceedingly close friendship\r\n     with his countryman Wenzel Czerny, a music-teacher living in the\r\n     Leopoldstadt, and from 1797 onward spent most of his leisure\r\n     evenings with the Czerny family, and thus the little son Karl,\r\n     in his eighth and ninth years, learned almost daily what works\r\n     Beethoven had in hand, and, like Krumpholz, became filled with\r\n     enthusiasm for the tone-hero.\r\n\r\nKrumpholz was a virtuoso on the mandolin, and hence, probably, that\r\npage of sketches by Beethoven in the Artaria Collection headed\r\n“Sonatine für Mandolin u. P. F.” Among the Zmeskall papers in the Royal\r\nImperial Library in Vienna there is a half-sheet of coarse foolscap\r\npaper upon which is written with lead-pencil in huge letters by the\r\nhand of Beethoven,\r\n\r\n     The Music Count is dismissed with infamy to-day.--\r\n\r\n     The First Violin will be exiled to the misery of Siberia.\r\n\r\n     The _Baron_ is forbidden for a whole month to ask questions and\r\n     never again to be overhasty, and he must concern himself with\r\n     nothing but his _ipse miserum_.\r\n\r\n    B.\r\n\r\n“Music Count” and “Baron” are, of course, Zmeskall; but these notices\r\nof Beethoven’s various first violins show the folly of attempting to\r\ndecide whether one of them or Schuppanzigh was to be sent to Siberia,\r\nso long as there is no hint whatever as to the time and occasion of the\r\nnote.\r\n\r\nThe very common mistake of forgetting that there is a time in the lives\r\nof distinguished men when they are but aspirants to fame, when they\r\nhave their reputations still to make, often, in fact, attracting less\r\nnotice and raising feebler hopes of future distinction in those who\r\nknow them, than many a more precocious contemporary--this mistake has\r\nthrown the figures of Schuppanzigh and his associates in the quartet\r\nconcerts at Prince Carl Lichnowsky’s into a very false prominence in\r\nthe picture of these first seven years of Beethoven’s Vienna life.\r\nThe composer himself was not the Beethoven whom we know. Had he died\r\nin 1800, his place in musical history would have been that of a great\r\npianoforte player and of a very promising young composer, whose decease\r\nthus in his prime had disappointed well-founded hopes of great future\r\neminence.\r\n\r\nSCHUPPANZIGH AND HIS QUARTET\r\n\r\nThis is doubly true of the members of the quartet. Had they passed away\r\nin early manhood, not one of them, except perhaps young Kraft, the only\r\none who ever distinguished himself as a virtuoso upon his instrument,\r\nwould have been remembered in the annals of music. They were during\r\nthese years but laying the foundation for future excellence and\r\ncelebrity as performers of Mozart’s, Haydn’s, Förster’s and Beethoven’s\r\nquartets. Schuppanzigh, first violin, and Weiss, viola, alone appear\r\nto have been constantly associated in their quartet-playing. Kraft,\r\nvioloncellist, was often absent, when his father, or Zmeskall, or some\r\nother, supplied his place; and as the second violin was often taken by\r\nthe master of the house, when they were engaged for private concerts,\r\nSina was, naturally, absent. Still, from 1794 to 1799, the four appear\r\nto have practised much and very regularly together. They enjoyed an\r\nadvantage known to no other quartet--that of playing the compositions\r\nof Haydn and Förster under the eyes of the composers, and being taught\r\nby them every effect that the music was intended to produce. Each of\r\nthe performers, therefore, knowing precisely the intentions of the\r\ncomposer, acquired the difficult art of being independent and at the\r\nsame time of being subordinate to the general effect. When Beethoven\r\nbegan to compose quartets he had, therefore, a set of performers\r\nschooled to perfection by his great predecessors, and who already had\r\nexperience in his own music through his trios and quartets.\r\n\r\nIgnatz Schuppanzigh, the leader, born 1776, died March 2, 1830 in\r\nVienna, originally studied music as a dilettante and became a capital\r\nplayer of the viola; but, about the time when Beethoven came to\r\nVienna, he exchanged that instrument for the violin and made music his\r\nprofession. He was fond of directing orchestral performances and seems\r\nto have gained a considerable degree of local reputation and to have\r\nbeen somewhat of a favorite in that capacity before reaching his 21st\r\nyear. In 1798-99, he took charge of those concerts in the Augarten\r\nestablished by Mozart and Martin, and afterwards led by Rudolph.\r\nSeyfried, writing after his death, calls Schuppanzigh a “natural born\r\nand really energetic leader of the orchestra.” The difference in age,\r\ncharacter and social position between him and Beethoven was such as\r\nnot to admit between them that higher and nobler friendship which\r\nunited the latter and Zmeskall; but they could be, and were, of great\r\nuse to each other, and there was a strong personal liking, if not\r\naffection, which was mutual. Schuppanzigh’s person early assumed very\r\nmuch of the form and proportions of Sterne’s Dr. Slop, and after his\r\nreturn from Russia he is one of the “Milord Falstaffs” of Beethoven’s\r\ncorrespondence and Conversation Books. His obesity was, however,\r\nalready the subject of the composer’s jests, and he must have been\r\nan exceedingly good-tempered young man, to bear with and forgive the\r\ncoarse and even abusive text of the short vocal piece (1801) headed\r\n“Lob auf den Dicken” (“Praise of the Fat One”). But it is evidently a\r\nmere jest, and was taken as such. It is worthy of note that Beethoven\r\nand Schuppanzigh in addressing each other used neither the familiar\r\n“du” nor the respectful “Sie,” but “er”--a fact which has been supposed\r\nto prove Beethoven’s great contempt for the violinist; but as it\r\nwould prove equal contempt on the other side, it proves too much. Of\r\nSina and Weiss, both Silesians by birth, there is little that need be\r\nadded here. Weiss became the first viola player of Vienna, and a not\r\nunsuccessful composer of ballet and other music.\r\n\r\nAnton Kraft (the father) came from Bohemia to pursue his legal studies\r\nin Vienna, but abandoned them to enter the Imperial Court Orchestra as\r\nvioloncellist. In 1778, he accepted an invitation from Haydn to join\r\nthe orchestra in Esterhaz; where, on the 18th of December of the same\r\nyear, his son Nicholas Anton was born. The child, endowed by nature\r\nwith great musical talents, enjoyed the advantages of his father’s\r\ninstructions and example and of growing up under the eye of Haydn and\r\nin the constant study of that great musician’s works. Upon the death\r\nof Esterhazy and the dispersion of his orchestra, Kraft came with his\r\nson, now in his fourteenth year, to Vienna. On April 15th, 1792,\r\nNicholas played a concerto composed by his father at the “Widows and\r\nOrphans” concert, and on the 21st again appeared in a concert given\r\nby the father. Notwithstanding a very remarkable success, the son was\r\ndestined for another profession than music; and from this time until\r\nhis eighteenth year, he played his instrument only as an amateur, and\r\nas such Beethoven first knew the youth. But when the young Prince\r\nLobkowitz formed his orchestra in 1796, both the Krafts were engaged,\r\nand Nicholas Anton thenceforth made music his profession. In the\r\nmaturity of his years and powers, his only rival among all the German\r\nvioloncellists was Bernhard Romberg.\r\n\r\nSchindler, with his characteristic inattention to dates, observes,\r\nspeaking of Schuppanzigh, Weiss and the elder Kraft:\r\n\r\nKNOWLEDGE OF ORCHESTRAL INSTRUMENTS\r\n\r\n     These three artists are intimately connected with the development\r\n     of Beethoven and, indeed, with a large portion of his\r\n     creations; wherefore they will frequently be remembered here.\r\n     Meanwhile it may suffice to say that it was to this company of\r\n     practically-trained musicians that the rising young composer owed\r\n     his knowledge of the efficient use of stringed instruments. In\r\n     addition are to be mentioned Joseph Friedlowsky, who taught our\r\n     master the mechanism of the clarinet, and the famous hornist,\r\n     Johann Wenzel Stich, who called himself Giovanni Punto in Italian,\r\n     to whom Beethoven owed what he knew of the proper writing for\r\n     horn, of which he already gave striking illustration in his\r\n     Sonata for Horn, Op. 17. In the mechanism of the flute and its\r\n     construction, which underwent so many changes in the first\r\n     decades of the century, Carl Scholl steadily remained Beethoven’s\r\n     instructor.\r\n\r\nThere is doubtless some degree of truth in this in so far as it relates\r\nto a later period. Punto, of course, gave Beethoven a new revelation\r\nof the powers and possibilities of the horn, as Dragonetti did of the\r\ncontrabass; but he first came to Vienna near the end of 1799, and died\r\nat Prague only three years after (February 16, 1803). All the others\r\nhere named by Schindler--with one exception, the elder Kraft--were\r\nyouths of 16-18 years, when Beethoven composed his first and second\r\nconcertos--works which prove that he was not altogether ignorant of the\r\nuse of orchestral instruments! Had Schindler known something of the\r\nhistory of Max Franz’s orchestra in Bonn, he would have avoided many a\r\nmistake.[87]\r\n\r\nJohann Nepomuk Hummel, the pupil of Mozart, was another of the youths\r\nwhom Beethoven drew into his circle. In 1795, the elder Hummel brought\r\nback his son to Vienna (from that very successful concert tour which\r\nhad occupied the last six years and had made the boy known even to the\r\ncities of distant Scotland) and put him to the studies of counterpoint\r\nand composition with Albrechtsberger and Salieri. He seems to have been\r\nquietly at his studies, playing only in private, until April 28th,\r\n1799, when he again appeared in public both as pianist and composer, in\r\na concert in the Augartensaal, directed by Schuppanzigh. “He performed\r\na symphony besides a melodrama composed for the occasion and between\r\nthem played prettily _composed_ improvisations on the pianoforte.”\r\nThat the talented and promising boy of seventeen years should, upon\r\narriving home again, seek the acquaintance and favor of one who during\r\nhis absence had made so profound an impression upon the Vienna public\r\nas Beethoven, and that the latter should have rejoiced to show kindness\r\nto Mozart’s favorite pupil, hardly needs to be mentioned. A chapter\r\nof description would not illustrate the nature of their intercourse\r\nso vividly, as two short but exceedingly characteristic notes of\r\nBeethoven’s which Hummel preserved and which found their way into print\r\nafter his death:\r\n\r\n     I\r\n\r\n     He is not to come to me again. He is a treacherous dog and may the\r\n     flayer get all such treacherous dogs!\r\n\r\n     II\r\n\r\n     Herzens Natzerl:\r\n\r\n     You are an honest fellow and I now see you were right. Come, then,\r\n     to me this afternoon. You’ll find Schuppanzigh here also and we\r\n     two will bump, thump and pump you to your heart’s delight. A kiss\r\n     from\r\n\r\n    Your\r\n\r\n    Beethoven\r\n    also called Mehlschöberl.[88]\r\n\r\nENVIOUS VIENNESE MUSICIANS\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Eleonore von Breuning, Beethoven described many of the\r\nVienna pianists as his “deadly enemies.” Schindler’s observations upon\r\nthe composer’s relations with the Viennese musicians, though written\r\nin his peculiar style, seem to be very judicious and correct.\r\n\r\n     Nobody is likely to expect, he says (Vol. I, 23-24), that an\r\n     artist who made his way upwards as our Beethoven, although almost\r\n     confining his activities exclusively to aristocratic circles\r\n     that upheld him in extraordinary fashion, would remain free\r\n     from the attacks of his colleagues; on the contrary, the reader\r\n     will be prepared to see a host of enemies advance against him\r\n     because of the shining qualities and evidences of genius of our\r\n     hero, in contrast with the heavy burden of social idiosyncrasies\r\n     and uncouthness. More than anything else, what seemed least\r\n     tolerable to his opponents was the notion that his appearance, the\r\n     excitability which he controlled too little in his intercourse\r\n     with his colleagues and his lack of consideration in passing\r\n     judgment were natural accompaniments of genius. His too small\r\n     toleration of many bizarreries and weaknesses of high society,\r\n     and on the other hand his severe demand on his colleagues for\r\n     higher culture, even his Bonn dialect, afforded his enemies more\r\n     than enough material to revenge themselves on him by evil gossip\r\n     and slander.... The musicians in Vienna at that time, with a very\r\n     few exceptions, were lacking, not only in artistic, but also\r\n     in the most necessary degree of general, education and were as\r\n     full of the envy of handicraftsmen as the members of the guilds\r\n     themselves. There was a particular antipathy to all foreigners\r\n     as soon as they manifested a purpose to make their homes in the\r\n     imperial city.\r\n\r\nSchindler might have added that the change had been in no small degree\r\nproduced through the instructions and example of Beethoven as they\r\nacted upon the Czernys, Moscheles and other young admirers of his\r\ngenius. In short, Beethoven’s instant achievement of a position as\r\nartist only paralleled by Mozart and of a social rank which Gluck,\r\nSalieri, Haydn had gained only after making their names famous\r\nthroughout Europe, together with the general impression that the mantle\r\nof Mozart had fallen upon him--all this begat bitter envy in those\r\nwhom his talents and genius overshadowed; they revenged themselves\r\nby deriding him for his personal peculiarities and by condemning and\r\nridiculing the novelties in his compositions; while he met their envy\r\nwith disdain, their criticisms with contempt; and, when he did not\r\ntreat their compositions with indifference, but too often only noticed\r\nthem with sarcasm.\r\n\r\nThis picture, certainly, is not an agreeable one, but all the evidence\r\nproves it, unfortunately, faithful. Such men as Salieri, Gyrowetz,\r\nWeigl, are not to be understood as included in the term “pianist” as\r\nused by Beethoven in his letter to Eleonore von Breuning. For these men\r\n“stood high in Beethoven’s respect,” says Schindler, and his words are\r\nconfirmed to the fullest extent by the Conversation Books and other\r\nauthorities; which also show that Eybler’s name might have been added\r\nto the list. They were all more or less older than Beethoven, and for\r\ntheir contrapuntal learning, particularly in the case of Weigl and\r\nEybler, he esteemed them very highly. No indications, however, have\r\nbeen found, that he was upon terms of close private friendship and\r\nintimacy with either.\r\n\r\nFRIENDSHIPS WITH WOMEN\r\n\r\nBeethoven was no exception to the general rule, that men of genius\r\ndelight in warm and lasting friendships with women of superior minds\r\nand culture--not meaning those “conquests” which, according to Wegeler,\r\neven during his first three years in Vienna, “he occasionally made,\r\nwhich if not impossible for many an Adonis would still have been\r\ndifficult.” Let such matters, even if details concerning them were\r\nnow attainable, be forgotten. His celibacy was by no means owing to\r\na deliberate choice of a single life. What is necessary and proper\r\nof the little that is known on _this_ point will, in due time, be\r\nimparted simply and free from gloss or superfluous comment. As to his\r\nfriendships with the other sex, it would be throwing the view of them\r\ninto very false perspective to employ those of later years in giving\r\npiquancy to a chapter here. Let them also come in due order and thus,\r\nwhile they lose nothing of interest, they may, perchance afford relief\r\nand give brightness to canvas which otherwise might sometimes become\r\ntoo sombre. Happily during these prosperous years now before us, the\r\npicture has been for the most part bright and sunny and the paucity of\r\nthe information upon the topic in question is of less consequence.\r\n\r\nIn the present connection one of our old Bonn friends again comes upon\r\nthe scene. The beautiful, talented and accomplished Magdalene Willmann\r\nwas invited to sing at Venice during the carnival of 1794. She left\r\nBonn the preceding summer with her brother Max and his wife (Fräulein\r\nTribolet) to fulfill the engagement. After leaving Venice, they gave\r\na concert in Gratz, and journeyed on to Vienna. Here Max and his wife\r\nremained, having accepted engagements from Schikaneder, while Magdalene\r\nwent on to Berlin. Not suiting the operatic public there she returned\r\nto Vienna, and was soon engaged to sing both German and Italian parts\r\nin the Court Opera. Beethoven renewed his intercourse with them and\r\nsoon became so captivated with the charms of the beautiful Magdalene as\r\nto offer her his hand. This fact was communicated to the author by a\r\ndaughter of Max Willmann, still living in 1860, who had often heard her\r\nfather speak of it. To the question, why her aunt did not accept the\r\noffer of Beethoven, Madame S. hesitated a moment, and then, laughing,\r\nreplied: “Because he was so ugly, and half crazy!” In 1799, Magdalene\r\nmarried a certain Galvani, but her happiness was short; she died toward\r\nthe end of 1801.\r\n\r\nTwo letters of Beethoven to be found in the printed collection have\r\nbeen preserved from the period before us, addressed to Christine\r\nGerhardi, a young woman of high distinction in society at the time for\r\nthe splendor of her talents and her high culture. Dr. Sonnleithner\r\nwrote of her:\r\n\r\n     She was the daughter of an official at the court of the Emperor\r\n     Leopold II ... an excellent singer, but remained a dilettante\r\n     and sang chiefly in concerts for charitable purposes (which she\r\n     herself arranged), or for the benefit of eminent artists. Old\r\n     Professor Peter Frank was director of the general hospital of\r\n     Vienna in the neighborhood of which (No. 20 Alserstrasse) she\r\n     lived. He was a great lover of music, but his son, Dr. Joseph\r\n     Frank, was a greater; he made essays in composition and arranged\r\n     musical soirées at the home of his father at which Beethoven\r\n     and Fräulein Gerhardi took part, playing and singing. The son\r\n     frequently composed cantatas, which Beethoven corrected, for the\r\n     name-days and birthdays of his father, and in which Fräulein\r\n     Gerhardi sang the soprano solos.... She was at the time the most\r\n     famous amateur singer in Vienna, and inasmuch as Haydn knew\r\n     her well there is no doubt but that he had her in mind when he\r\n     composed “The Creation”; indeed, she sang the soprano part with\r\n     great applause not only at Schwarzenberg but also at the first\r\n     performance in the Burgtheater. All reports agree that she met\r\n     Beethoven often at Frank’s and that he frequently accompanied her\r\n     singing on the pianoforte. He did not give her lessons.\r\n\r\nDr. Joseph von Frank and Christine Gerhardi were married on August 20,\r\n1798; they moved away from Vienna in 1804.\r\n\r\nA few notes upon certain young women to whom Beethoven dedicated\r\ncompositions at this period of his life may form no inappropriate close\r\nto this chapter. It was much the custom then for teachers of music\r\nto dedicate their works to pupils, especially to those who belonged\r\nto the higher social ranks--such dedications being at the same time\r\ncompliments to the pupils and advertisements for the instructors, with\r\nthe farther advantage often of being sources of pecuniary profit. When,\r\ntherefore, we read the name of Baroness Albini on the title-page of\r\ncertain sonatas by Sterkel, of Julia Countess Guicciardi on one by\r\nKleinheinz, of Anna Countess Mailath on songs by Teyber, we assume at\r\nonce the probability in these and like instances that the relation\r\nof master and pupil existed. Beethoven also followed the custom; and\r\nthe young ladies, subjects of the following notices, are all known or\r\nsupposed to have taken lessons of him.\r\n\r\nAnna Louisa Barbara (“La Comtesse Babette”) was the daughter of Karl\r\nCount Keglevics de Busin, of Hungarian Croatian lineage, and Barbara\r\nCountess Zichy. She married Prince Innocenz d’Erba Odescalchi on the\r\n10th of February, 1801 (another authority gives 1800). Beethoven’s\r\ndedications to her are the Sonata, Op. 7 (published in 1797), the\r\nVariations “La stessa la stessissima” (1799), and the Pianoforte\r\nConcerto, Op. 15, 1801--the last to her as Princess Odescalchi. A note\r\nby the composer to Zmeskall--which, judging both from its contents and\r\nthe handwriting, could not have been written later than 1801-2--shows\r\nthat the Odescalchi palace was one of those at which he took part in\r\nmusical soirées.\r\n\r\n“Countess Henriette Lichnowsky,” writes Count Amade, “was the sister\r\nof the ruling Prince Carl, and was doubtless married to the Marquis\r\nof Carneville after the dedication to her of the Rondo (G major, Op.\r\n51, No. 2, published in September, 1802); she lived in Paris after\r\nher marriage and died about 1830.” The Rondo was first dedicated to\r\nCountess Giulietta Guicciardi, but Beethoven asked it back in exchange\r\nfor the C-sharp minor Sonata; to which fact we shall recur presently.\r\nCountess Thun, to whom Beethoven dedicated the Clarinet Trio, Op.\r\n11, in 1797, was the mother of Prince Carl Lichnowsky and Countess\r\nHenriette Lichnowsky. She died May 18, 1800. The Sonata in E-flat,\r\nOp. 27, No. 1, was dedicated to Josepha Sophia, wife of Prince Johann\r\nJoseph von Liechtenstein, daughter of Joachim Egon, Landgrave of\r\nFürstenberg-Weitra. She was born on June 20, 1776, married on April\r\n22, 1792 and died February 23, 1848. Whether her father was related\r\nat all, and if so, how, to the Fürstenberg in whose house Beethoven\r\ngave lessons in Bonn, is not known. Her husband, however, was first\r\ncousin to Count Ferdinand von Waldstein. The Baroness Braun to whom\r\nBeethoven dedicated the two Pianoforte Sonatas Op. 14 and the Sonata\r\nfor Horn in 1801, was the wife of Baron Peter von Braun, lessee of\r\nthe Nationaltheater and afterwards of the Theater an der Wien. The\r\ndedications disclose an early association which eventually led to\r\nBeethoven’s being asked to compose an opera. It is not known that\r\nBeethoven was a social visitor in the house of Baron Braun, but he\r\nwas a highly respected guest in the house of Count Browne, to whose\r\nwife Beethoven dedicated the “Waldmädchen” Variations and the three\r\nPianoforte Sonatas, Op. 10.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[86] Amenda returned to his home in Courland in the fall of 1799. The\r\nfriends corresponded with each other for a time, but the majority\r\nof Beethoven’s letters are lost. While a student at the University\r\nin Leipzig, Amenda’s grandson placed some of them in the hands of a\r\npublisher at his request and did not get them back. Amenda was first a\r\nprivate teacher, became a preacher in Talsen in 1802, provost of the\r\ndiocese of Kadau in 1820, consistorial councillor in 1830 and died\r\non March 8, 1836. A portrait painted in 1808, is preserved in the\r\nBeethoven Museum in Bonn.\r\n\r\n[87] Beethoven did not always follow the suggestions of these men.\r\nAccording to an anecdote told by Doležalek to Otto Jahn, Kraft once\r\ncomplained that a passage was not playable. “It’s got to be,” answered\r\nBeethoven. In a like vein K. Holz relates that “Beethoven asked an\r\nexcellent artist whether or not certain things were possible”; the\r\nquestion of how difficult they were did not enter. Thus Friedlowsky for\r\nclarinet, Czerwensky for oboe, Hradezky and Herbst for horn. If others\r\ncomplained of impossibilities the answer was “They can do it and you\r\nmust.” (From Thayer’s papers.)\r\n\r\n[88] The humor to which Beethoven resorts in this note in order to show\r\nhis contrition necessarily evaporates in any attempt to translate its\r\nViennese colloquialisms. “Herzens Natzerl” is to be understood as “Dear\r\nlittle Ignacius of my heart,” Nazerl being an affectionate diminutive\r\nof Ignaz or Ignacius. Why it should have been applied to Hummel, whose\r\nChristian names were Johann Nepomuk, does not appear. “Mehlschöberl”\r\nis a term which has survived in the Austrian cuisine of to-day, the\r\narticle itself being a sort of soup dumpling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII\r\n\r\n     Beethoven’s Character and Personality--His Disposition--Love of\r\n     Nature--Relations with the Opposite Sex--Literary Tastes--His\r\n     Letters--Manner of Composing--The Sketchbooks--Origin of His\r\n     Deafness.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1800 is an important era in Beethoven’s history. It is the\r\nyear in which, cutting loose from the pianoforte, he asserted his\r\nclaims to a position with Mozart and the still living and productive\r\nHaydn in the higher forms of chamber and orchestral composition--the\r\nquartet and the symphony. It is the year, too, in which the bitter\r\nconsciousness of an increasing derangement of his organs of hearing\r\nwas forced upon him and the terrible anticipation of its incurable\r\nnature and of its final result in almost total deafness began to\r\nharass and distress him. The course of his life was afterwards so\r\nmodified, on the one hand, by the prosperous issue of these new appeals\r\nto the taste and judgment of the public, and, on the other, by the\r\nunhappy progress of his malady, each acting and reacting upon a nature\r\nsingularly exceptional, that for this and other reasons some points in\r\nhis personal character and habits, and a few general remarks upon and\r\nillustrations of another topic or two must be made before resuming the\r\nnarrative of events.\r\n\r\nA true and exhaustive picture of Beethoven as a man would present an\r\nalmost ludicrous contrast to that which is generally entertained as\r\ncorrect. As sculptors and painters have each in turn idealized the\r\nwork of his predecessor, until the composer stands before us like a\r\nHomeric god until those who knew him personally, could they return\r\nto earth, would never suspect that the grand form and noble features\r\nof the more pretentious portraits are intended to represent the\r\nshort muscular figure and pock-pitted face of their old friend--so\r\nin literature evoked by the composer a similar process has gone on,\r\nwith a corresponding suppression of whatever is deemed common and\r\ntrivial, until he is made a being living in his own peculiar realm of\r\ngigantic ideas, above and apart from the rest of mankind--a sort of\r\nintellectual Thor, dwelling in “darkness and clouds of awful state,”\r\nand making in his music mysterious revelations of things unutterable!\r\nBut it is really some generations too soon for a conscientious\r\ninvestigator of his history to view him as a semi-mythological\r\npersonage, or to discover that his notes to friends asking for pens,\r\nmaking appointments to dinner at taverns, or complaining of servants,\r\nare “cyclopean blocks of granite,” which, like the “chops and tomato\r\nsauce” of Mr. Pickwick, contain depths unfathomable of profound\r\nmeaning. The present age must be content to find in Beethoven, with\r\nall his greatness, a very human nature, one which, if it showed\r\nextraordinary strength, exhibited also extraordinary weaknesses.\r\n\r\nINCONSISTENT TRAITS OF CHARACTER\r\n\r\nIt was the great misfortune of Beethoven’s youth--his impulses good and\r\nbad being by nature exceedingly quick and violent--that he did not grow\r\nup under the influence of a wise and strict parental control, which\r\nwould have given him those habits of self-restraint that, once fixed,\r\nare a second and better nature, and through which the passions, curbed\r\nand moderated, remain only as sources of noble energy and power. His\r\nvery early admission into the orchestra of the theatre as cembalist,\r\nwas more to the advantage of his musical than of his moral development.\r\nIt was another misfortune that, in those years, when the strict\r\nregulations of a school would have compensated in some measure for the\r\nunwise, unsteady, often harsh discipline of his father, he was thus\r\nthrown into close connection with actors and actresses, who, in those\r\ndays, were not very distinguished for the propriety of their manners\r\nand morals. Before his seventeenth or eighteenth year, when he became\r\nknown to the Breuning family and Count Waldstein, he could hardly have\r\nlearned the importance of cultivating those high principles of life\r\nand conduct on which in later years he laid so much stress. And, at\r\nthat period of life, the character even under ordinary circumstances\r\nis so far developed, the habits have become so far formed and fixed,\r\nand the natural tendencies have acquired so much strength, that it is,\r\nas a rule, too late to conquer the power of a perfect self-command.\r\nAt all events, the consequences of a deficient early moral education\r\nfollowed Beethoven through life and are visible in the frequent\r\ncontests between his worse and his better nature and in his constant\r\ntendency to extremes. To-day, upon some perhaps trivial matter, he\r\nbursts into ungovernable wrath; to-morrow, his penitence exceeds the\r\nmeasure of his fault. To-day he is proud, unbending, offensively\r\ncareless of those claims which society grants to people of high\r\nrank; to-morrow his humility is more than adequate to the occasion.\r\nThe poverty in which he grew up was not without its effect upon his\r\ncharacter. He never learned to estimate money at its real value; though\r\noften profuse and generous to a fault, even wasteful, yet at times he\r\nwould fall into the other extreme. With all his sense of nobility of\r\nindependence, he early formed the habit of leaning upon others; and\r\nthis the more, as his malady increased, which certainly was a partial\r\njustification; but he thus became prone to follow unwise counsels, or,\r\nwhen his pride was touched, to assert an equally unwise independence.\r\nAt other times, in the multitude of counsellors he became the victim\r\nof utter irresolution, when decision and firmness were indispensable\r\nand essential to his welfare. Thus, both by following the impulse of\r\nthe moment, and by hesitation when a prompt determination was demanded,\r\nhe took many a false step, which could no longer be retrieved when\r\nreflection brought with it bitter regret.\r\n\r\nIt would be doing great injustice both to Beethoven and to the present\r\nwriter to understand the preceding remarks as being intended to\r\nrepresent the composer’s lapses in these regards, as being more than\r\nunpleasant and unfortunate episodes in the general tenor of his life;\r\nbut as they did occur to his great disadvantage, the fact cannot be\r\nsilently passed over.\r\n\r\nA romantically sentimental admiration of the heroes of ancient\r\nclassic literature, having its origin in Paris, had become widely\r\nthe fashion in Beethoven’s youth. The democratic theories of the\r\nFrench sentimentalists had received a new impulse from the dignified\r\nsimplicity of the foreign representatives of the young American\r\nRepublic, Franklin, Adams, Jay--from the retirement to private life\r\non their plantations and farms of the great military leaders in\r\nthe contest, Washington, Greene, Schuyler, Knox and others, after\r\nthe war with England was over; from the pride taken by the French\r\nofficers, who had served in America, in their insignia of the order\r\nof the Cincinnati; and even from the letters and journals of German\r\nofficers, who, in captivity, had formed friendships with many of the\r\nbetter class of the republican leaders, and seen with their own eyes\r\nin what simplicity they lived while guiding the destinies of the\r\nnew-born nation. Thus through the greater part of Central Europe the\r\nidea became current of a pure and sublime humanity, above and beyond\r\nthe influence of the passions, of which Cincinnatus, Scipio, Cato,\r\nWashington, Franklin, were the supposed representatives. Zschokke makes\r\nhis Heuwen say: “Virtue and the heroes of antiquity had inspired me\r\nwith enthusiasm for virtue and heroism”; and so, also, Beethoven. He\r\nexalted his imagination and fancy by the perusal of the German poets\r\nand translations of the ancient and English classics, especially Homer,\r\nPlutarch and Shakespeare; dwelt fondly upon the great characters as\r\nmodels for the conduct of life; but between the sentiment which one\r\nfeels and the active principle on which he acts, there is often a wide\r\ncleft. That Beethoven proved to be no Stoic, that he never succeeded in\r\ngoverning his passions with absolute sway, was not because the spirit\r\nwas unwilling; the flesh was weak. Adequate firmness of character had\r\nnot been acquired in early years. But those who have most thoroughly\r\nstudied his life, know best how pure and lofty were his aspirations,\r\nhow wide and deep his sympathies with all that is good, how great his\r\nheart, how, on the whole, heroic his endurance of his great calamity.\r\nThey can best feel the man’s true greatness, admire the nobility of his\r\nnature, and drop the tear of sorrow and regret upon his vagaries and\r\nfaults. He who is morbidly sensitive, and compelled to keep constant\r\nward and watch over his passions, can best appreciate and sympathize\r\nwith the man, Beethoven.\r\n\r\nTruth and candor compel the confession, that in those days of\r\nprosperity he bore his honors with less of meekness than we could wish;\r\nthat he had lost something of that modesty and ingenuousness eulogized\r\nby Junker ten years before, in his Mergentheim letter. His “somewhat\r\nlofty bearing” had even been reported by the correspondent of the\r\n“Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung.” Traces of self-sufficiency and even\r\narrogance--faults almost universal among young and successful geniuses,\r\noften in a far higher degree than was true of Beethoven, and with not\r\na tithe of his reason--are unquestionably visible. No one can read\r\nwithout regret his remarks upon certain persons not named, with whom at\r\nthis very time he was upon terms of apparently intimate friendship. “I\r\nvalue them,” he writes, “only by what they do for me.... I look upon\r\nthem only as instruments upon which I play when I feel so disposed.”\r\nHis “somewhat lofty bearing” was matter for jest to the venerable\r\nHaydn, who, according to a trustworthy tradition, when Beethoven’s\r\nvisits to him had become few and far between would inquire of other\r\nvisitors: “How goes it with our Great Mogul?” Nor would the young\r\nnobles, whose society he frequented, take offence; but it certainly\r\nmade him enemies among those whom he “valued according to their service\r\nand looked upon as mere instruments”--and no wonder!\r\n\r\nPierson, in his edition of the so-called “Beethoven’s Studien,” has\r\nadded to Seyfried’s personal sketches a few reminiscences of that\r\nGriesinger, who was so long Saxon Minister in Vienna, and to whom we\r\nowe the valuable “Biographische Notizen über Joseph Haydn.” One of his\r\nanecdotes is to the purpose here and may be taken as substantially\r\nhistorical.\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN’S SELF-ESTEEM INJURED\r\n\r\nWhen he was still only an attaché, and Beethoven was little known\r\nexcept as a celebrated pianoforte player, both being still young, they\r\nhappened to meet at the house of Prince Lobkowitz. In conversation with\r\na gentleman present, Beethoven said in substance, that he wished to\r\nbe relieved from all bargain and sale of his works, and would gladly\r\nfind some one willing to pay him a certain income for life, for which\r\nhe should possess the exclusive right of publishing all he wrote;\r\nadding, “and I would not be idle in composition. I believe Goethe does\r\nthis with Cotta, and, if I mistake not, Handel’s London publisher held\r\nsimilar terms with him.”\r\n\r\n“My dear young man,” returned the other, “You must not complain; for\r\nyou are neither a Goethe nor a Handel, and it is not to be expected\r\nthat you ever will be; for such masters will not be born again.”\r\nBeethoven bit his lips, gave a most contemptuous glance at the speaker,\r\nand said no more. Lobkowitz endeavored to appease him, and in a\r\nsubsequent conversation said:\r\n\r\n“My dear Beethoven, the gentleman did not intend to wound you. It\r\nis an established maxim, to which most men adhere, that the present\r\ngeneration cannot possibly produce such mighty spirits as the dead, who\r\nhave already earned their fame.”\r\n\r\n“So much the worse, Your Highness,” retorted Beethoven: “but with men\r\nwho will not believe and trust in me because I am as yet unknown to\r\nuniversal fame, I cannot hold intercourse!”\r\n\r\nIt is easy for this generation, which has the productions of the\r\ncomposer’s whole life as the basis of its judgment of his powers,\r\nto speak disparagingly of his contemporaries for not being able to\r\ndiscover in his first twelve or fifteen works good reason for classing\r\nhim with Goethe and Handel; but he who stand upon a mountain cannot\r\njustly ridicule him on the plain for the narrow extent of his view.\r\nIt was as difficult then to conceive the possibility of instrumental\r\nmusic being elevated to heights greater than those reached by Haydn\r\nand Mozart, as it is for us to conceive of Beethoven being hereafter\r\nsurpassed.\r\n\r\nIn the short personal sketches of Beethoven’s friends which have been\r\nintroduced, the dates of their births have been noted so far as known,\r\nthat the reader may observe how very large a proportion of them were\r\nof the same age as the composer, or still younger--some indeed but\r\nboys--when he came to Vienna. And so it continued. As the years pass\r\nby in our narrative and names familiar to us disappear, the new ones\r\nwhich take their places, with rare exceptions, are still of men much\r\nyounger than himself. The older generation of musical amateurs at\r\nVienna, van Swieten and his class, had accepted the young Bonn organist\r\nand patronized him, as a pianist. But when Beethoven began to press his\r\nclaims as a composer, and, somewhat later, as his deafness increased,\r\nto neglect his playing, some of the elder friends had passed away,\r\nothers had withdrawn from society, and the number was few of those\r\nwho, like Lichnowsky, could comprehend that departures from the forms\r\nand styles of Mozart and Haydn were not necessarily faults. With the\r\ngreater number, as perfection necessarily admits of no improvement and\r\nboth quartet and symphony in _form_ had been carried to that point by\r\nHaydn and Mozart, it was a perfectly logical conclusion that farther\r\nprogress was impossible. They could not perceive that there was still\r\nroom for the invention or discovery of new elements of interest,\r\nbeauty, power; for such perceptions are the offspring of genius. With\r\nBeethoven they were instinctive.\r\n\r\nOne more remark: Towards the decline of life, the masterpieces of\r\nliterature and art, on which the taste was formed, are apt to become\r\ninvested in the mind with a sort of nimbus of sanctity; hence, the\r\nproductions of a young and daring innovator, even when the genius and\r\ntalent displayed in them are felt and receive just acknowledgement,\r\nhave the aspect, not only of an extravagant and erring waste of\r\nmisapplied powers, but of a kind of profane audacity. For these and\r\nsimilar reasons Beethoven’s novelties found little favor with the\r\nveterans of the concert-room.\r\n\r\nTHE HOMAGE OF YOUNG DISCIPLES\r\n\r\nThe criticism of the day was naturally ruled and stimulated by the\r\nsame spirit. Beethoven’s own confession how it at first wounded him,\r\nwill come in its order; but after he felt that his victory over it was\r\nsure--was in fact gained with a younger generation--he only laughed\r\nat the critics; to answer them, except by new works, was beneath him.\r\nSeyfried says of him (during the years of the “Eroica,” “Fidelio,”\r\netc.): “When he came across criticisms in which he was accused of\r\ngrammatical errors he rubbed his hands in glee and cried out with a\r\nloud laugh: ‘Yes, yes! they marvel and put their heads together because\r\nthey do not find it in any school of thoroughbass!’” But for the\r\nyoung of both sexes, Beethoven’s music had an extraordinary charm.\r\nAnd this not upon technical grounds, nor solely for its novelties,\r\nalways an attractive feature to the young, but because it appealed to\r\nthe sensibilities, excited emotions and touched the heart as no other\r\npurely instrumental compositions had ever done. And so it was that\r\nBeethoven also in his quality of composer soon gathered about him a\r\ncircle of young disciples, enthusiastic admirers. Their homage may well\r\nhave been grateful to him--as such is to every artist and scholar of\r\ngenius, who, striking out and steadfastly pursuing a new path, subjects\r\nhimself to the sharp animadversions of critics who, in all honesty,\r\nreally can see little or nothing of good in that which is not to be\r\nmeasured and judged by old standards. The voice of praise under such\r\ncircumstances is doubly pleasing. It is known that, when Beethoven’s\r\nworks began to find a just appreciation from a new generation of\r\ncritics, who had indeed been schooled by them, he collected and\r\npreserved a considerable number of laudatory articles, whose fate\r\ncannot now be traced. When, however, the natural and just satisfaction\r\nwhich is afforded by the homage of honest admirers and deservedly\r\neulogistic criticism, degenerates into a love of indiscriminate\r\npraise and flattery, it becomes a weakness, a fault. Of this error in\r\nBeethoven there are traces easily discernible, and especially in his\r\nlater years; there are pages of fulsome eulogy addressed to him in the\r\nConversation Books, which would make the reader blush for him, did not\r\nthe mere fact that such books existed remind him of the bitterness of\r\nthe composer’s lot. The failing was also sometimes his misfortune;\r\nfor those who were most profuse in their flatteries, and thus gained\r\nhis ear, were by no means the best of his counsellors. But aside from\r\nthe attractive force of his genius, Beethoven possessed a personal\r\nmagnetism, which attached his young worshippers to him and, all things\r\nconsidered, to his solid and lasting benefit in his private affairs.\r\nJust at this time, and for some years to come, his brothers usually\r\nrendered him the aid he needed; but thenceforth to the close of his\r\nlife, the names of a constant succession of young men will appear in\r\nand vanish from our narrative, who were ever necessary to him and ever\r\nready at his call with their voluntary services.\r\n\r\nBeethoven’s love of nature was already a marked trait of his character.\r\nThis was indulged and strengthened by long rambles upon the lofty hills\r\nand in the exquisitely beautiful valleys which render the environs of\r\nVienna to the north and west so charming. Hence, when he left the city\r\nto spend the hot summer months in the country, with but an exception\r\nor two in a long series of years, his residence was selected with a\r\nview to the indulgence of this noble passion. Hence, too, his great\r\ndelight in the once celebrated work of Christian Sturm: “Beobachtungen\r\nüber die Werke Gottes,” which, however absurd much of its natural\r\nphilosophy (in the old editions) appears now in the light of advanced\r\nknowledge, was then by far the best manual of popular scientific truth,\r\nand was unsurpassed in fitness to awaken and foster a taste for, and\r\nthe understanding of, the beauties of nature. Schindler has recorded\r\nthe master’s life-long study and admiration of this book. It was one\r\nwhich cherished his veneration for the Creator and Preserver of the\r\nuniverse, and yet left his contempt for procrustean religious systems\r\nand ecclesiastical dogmas its free course. “To him, who, in the love of\r\nNature, holds communion with her visible forms, she speaks a various\r\nlanguage,” says Bryant. Her language was thoroughly well understood by\r\nBeethoven; and when, in sorrow and affliction, his art, his Plutarch,\r\nhis “Odyssey,” proved to be resources too feeble for his comfort, he\r\nwent to Nature for solace, and rarely failed to find it.\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN’S MORAL PRINCIPLES\r\n\r\nArt has been so often disgraced by the bad morals and shameless lives\r\nof its votaries, that it is doubly gratifying to be able to affirm\r\nof Beethoven that, like Handel, Bach and Mozart, he did honor to his\r\nprofession by his personal character and habits. Although irregular,\r\nstill he was as simple and temperate in eating and drinking as was\r\npossible in the state of society in which he lived. That he was no\r\ninordinate lover of wine or strong drinks is certain. No allusion\r\nis remembered in any of his letters, notes, memoranda, nor in the\r\nConversation Books, which indicates a liking for any game of chance\r\nor skill. He does not appear to have known one playing-card from\r\nanother. Music, books, conversation with men and women of taste and\r\nintelligence, dancing, according to Ries (who adds that he could never\r\nlearn to dance in time--but Beethoven’s dancing days were soon over--),\r\nand, above all, his long walks, were his amusements and recreations.\r\nHis whim for riding was of short duration--at all events, the last\r\nallusion to any horse owned by him is in the anecdote on a previous\r\npage.\r\n\r\nOne rather delicate point demands a word: and surely, what Franklin\r\nin his autobiography could confess of himself, and Lockhart mention\r\nwithout scruple of Walter Scott, his father-in-law, need not be here\r\nsuppressed. Nor can it well be, since a false assumption on the\r\npoint has been made the basis already of a considerable quantity\r\nof fine writing, and employed to explain certain facts relative to\r\nBeethoven’s compositions. Spending his whole life in a state of society\r\nin which the vow of celibacy was by no means a vow of chastity; in\r\nwhich the parentage of a cardinal’s or archbishop’s children was\r\nneither a secret nor a disgrace; in which the illegitimate offspring\r\nof princes and magnates were proud of their descent and formed upon\r\nit well-grounded hopes of advancement and success in life; in which\r\nthe moderate gratification of the sexual was no more discountenanced\r\nthan the satisfying of any other natural appetite--it is nonsense to\r\nsuppose, that, under such circumstances, Beethoven could have puritanic\r\nscruples on that point. Those who have had occasion and opportunity\r\nto ascertain the facts, know that he had not, and are also aware that\r\nhe did not always escape the common penalties of transgressing the\r\nlaws of strict purity. But he had too much dignity of character ever\r\nto take part in scenes of low debauchery, or even when still young to\r\ndescend to the familiar jesting once so common between tavern girls and\r\nthe guests. Thus, as the elder Simrock related, upon the journey to\r\nMergentheim recorded in the earlier pages of this work, it happened at\r\nsome place where the company dined, that some of the young men prompted\r\nthe waiting-girl to play off her charms upon Beethoven. He received\r\nher advances and familiarities with repellent coldness; and as she,\r\nencouraged by the others, still persevered, he lost his patience, and\r\nput an end to her importunities by a smart box on the ear.\r\n\r\nThe practice, not uncommon in his time, of living with an unmarried\r\nwoman as a wife, was always abhorrent to him--how much so, a sad story\r\nwill hereafter illustrate; to a still greater degree an intrigue with\r\nthe wife of another man. In his later years he so broke off his once\r\nfamiliar intercourse with a distinguished composer and conductor of\r\nVienna, as hardly to return his greetings with common politeness.\r\nSchindler affirmed that the only reason for this was that the man in\r\nquestion had taken to his bed and board the wife of another.\r\n\r\nThe names of two married women might be here given, to whom at a\r\nlater period Beethoven was warmly attached; names which happily have\r\nhitherto escaped the eyes of literary scavengers, and are therefore\r\nhere suppressed. Certain of his friends used to joke him about these\r\nladies, and it is certain that he rather enjoyed their jests even\r\nwhen the insinuations, that his affection was beyond the limit of\r\nthe Platonic, were somewhat broad; but careful enquiry has failed to\r\nelicit any evidence that even in these cases he proved unfaithful to\r\nhis principles. A story related by Jahn is also to the point, viz.:\r\nthat Beethoven only by the urgent solicitations of the Czerny family\r\nwas after much refusal persuaded to extemporize in the presence of a\r\ncertain Madame Hofdemel. She was the widow of a man who had attempted\r\nher life and then committed suicide; and the refusal of Beethoven to\r\nplay before her arose from his having the general belief at the time,\r\nthat a too great intimacy had existed between her and Mozart. Jahn, it\r\nmay be observed, has recently had the great satisfaction of being able\r\nto prove the innocence of Mozart in this matter and of rescuing his\r\nmemory from the only dark shadow which rested upon it. This much on\r\nthis topic it has been deemed necessary to say here, not only for the\r\nreason above given, but to put an end to long-prevailing misconceptions\r\nand misconstructions of passages in Beethoven’s letters and private\r\nmemoranda and to save farther comment when they shall be introduced\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nBeethoven’s fine sense for the lyric element in poetry was already\r\nconspicuous in the fine tact with which the texts of his songs,\r\nbelonging in date to his last years in Bonn, were selected from the\r\nannual publications in which most of them appeared. Another fine\r\nproof of this is afforded by a glance through the older editions of\r\nMatthisson’s poems. In the fourth (1797), there are but two which are\r\nreally well adapted to composition in the song-form--the “Adelaide” and\r\n“Das Opferlied.” A third Beethoven left unfinished. He had doubtless\r\nbeen led to attempt its composition through the force of its appeal\r\nto his personal feelings and sympathies, but soon discovering its\r\nnon-lyrical character abandoned it. It is the “Wunsch.”\r\n\r\nRochlitz in his letters from Vienna (1822) reports Beethoven’s humorous\r\naccount of his enthusiasm for Klopstock in his early life:\r\n\r\n     Since that summer in Carlsbad I read Goethe every day, that is,\r\n     when I read at all. He (Goethe) has killed Klopstock for me. You\r\n     are surprised? And now you laugh? Ah ha! It is because I have read\r\n     Klopstock. I carried him about with me for years while walking\r\n     and also at other times. Well, I did not always understand him,\r\n     of course. He leaps about so much and he begins at too lofty an\r\n     elevation. Always _Maestoso_, D-flat major! Isn’t it so? But he\r\n     is great and uplifts the soul nevertheless. When I could not\r\n     understand him I could sort of guess. If only he did not always\r\n     want to die! That will come quickly enough. Well, it always sounds\r\n     well, at any rate, etc.\r\n\r\nThus, whatever scattered hints bearing upon the point come under our\r\nnotice combine to impart a noble idea of Beethoven’s poetic taste and\r\nculture, and to show that the allusions to the ancient classic authors\r\nin his letters and conversation were not made for display, but were the\r\nnatural consequence of a love for and a hearty appreciation of them\r\nderived from their frequent perusal in translations.\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN AS A LETTER-WRITER\r\n\r\nBeethoven’s correspondence forms so important a portion of his\r\nbiography that something must be said here upon his character as a\r\nletter-writer. A few of his autograph letters bear marks of previous\r\nstudy and careful elaboration; but, in general, whatever he wrote in\r\nthe way of private correspondence was dashed off on the spur of the\r\nmoment, and with no thought that it would ever come under any eye but\r\nthat for which it was intended. It is therefore easy to imagine how\r\nenergetically he would have protested could he have known that his most\r\ninsignificant notes were preserved in such numbers, and that the time\r\nwould come when they would all be made public; or, still worse, that\r\nsome which were but the offspring of momentary pique against those with\r\nwhom he lived in closest relations would be used after his death to\r\ntheir injury; and that outbursts of sudden passion--when the wrong was\r\nperhaps as often on his side as on the other--after all the parties\r\nconcerned had passed away, would have an almost judicial authority\r\naccorded to them.\r\n\r\nIn studying a collection of some eight hundred of his letters and\r\nnotes,[89] originals and copies in print or manuscript, the most\r\nstriking fact is the insignificance of by far the greater number--that\r\nso few bear marks of any care in their preparation, or contain matter\r\nof any intrinsic value. In fact, perhaps the greater part of the short\r\nnotes to Zmeskall and others owe their origin to Beethoven’s dislike of\r\nentrusting oral messages to his servants. For the most part it is in\r\nvain to seek in his correspondence anything bearing upon the theory or\r\nart of music; very seldom is any opinion expressed upon the productions\r\nof any contemporary composer; no vivid sketches of men and manners\r\nflow from his pen, like those which render the letters of Mozart\r\nand Mendelssohn so charming. The proportion of their correspondence\r\nwhich possesses more than a merely biographical value was large; of\r\nBeethoven’s very small.\r\n\r\nHis letters, of course, exhibit the usual imperfections of a hasty\r\nand confidential correspondence; sometimes, indeed, of an aggravated\r\ncharacter. Some of them contain loose statements of fact, such as\r\nall men are liable to make through haste or imperfect knowledge;\r\nothers contain passages of which the only conceivable explanation is\r\nSchindler’s statement that Beethoven sometimes amused himself with\r\nthe harmless mystification of others; but, taken together, the more\r\nimportant letters--while they usually evince his difficulty in finding\r\nthe best expressions of his thoughts and his constant struggle with\r\nthe rules of his mother tongue--place his truth and candor in a very\r\nfavorable light and sometimes rise into a rude eloquence. The reader\r\nfeels that when the writer is unjust he is under the influence of a\r\nmistake or passion--and, as a rule, it is not too late to detect such\r\ninjustice; that his errors of fact are simply mistakes, honestly made\r\nand easily corrected; that if, in the mass, a few paragraphs occur\r\nwhich can be neither fully justified nor excused, it is not to be\r\nforgotten that they were not intended for our eyes and that they were\r\nwritten under the constant pressure of a great calamity, which made him\r\ndoubly sensitive and irritable; and so it will be easy, like Sterne’s\r\nRecording Angel, to blot such passages with a tear.\r\n\r\nAnother striking fact of Beethoven’s correspondence, when viewed as a\r\nwhole, is the proof it affords that, except in his hours of profound\r\ndepression, he was far from being the melancholy and gloomy character\r\nof popular belief. He shows himself here--as he was by nature--of a\r\ngay and lively temperament, fond of a jest, an inveterate though not\r\nalways a very happy punster, a great lover of wit and humor. It is a\r\ncause for profound gratitude that it was so; since he thus preserved\r\nan elasticity of spirits that enabled him to escape the consequences\r\nof brooding in solitude over his great misfortune; to rise superior to\r\nhis fate and concentrate his great powers upon his self-imposed tasks;\r\nand to meet with hope and courage the cruel fortune which put an end to\r\nso many well-founded expectations and ambitious projects, and confined\r\nhim to a single road to fame and honor--that of composition. It happens\r\nthat several of the more valuable and interesting of his letters\r\nbelong to the period immediately following that now before us, and in\r\nthem we are able to trace, with reasonable accuracy, the effect which\r\nhis incipient and increasing deafness produced upon him--first, the\r\nanxiety caused by earliest symptoms; then the profound grief bordering\r\nupon despair when the final result had become certain; and at last his\r\nsubmission to and acceptance of his fate. There is in truth something\r\nnobly heroic in the manner in which Beethoven at length rose superior\r\nto his great affliction. The magnificent series of works produced\r\nin the ten years from 1798 to 1808 are no greater monuments to his\r\ngenius than to the godlike resolution with which he wrought out the\r\ninspirations of that genius under circumstances most fitted to weaken\r\nits efforts and restrain its energies.\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN AND HIS SKETCHBOOKS\r\n\r\nBeethoven was seldom without a folded sheet or two of music paper in\r\nhis pocket upon which he wrote with pencil in two or three measures of\r\nmusic hints of any musical thought which might occur to him wherever he\r\nchanced to be. Towards the end of his life his Conversation Books often\r\nanswered the same purpose; and there are traditions of bills-of-fare at\r\ndining-rooms having been honored with ideas afterwards made immortal.\r\nThis habit gave Abbé Gelinek a foundation for the following amusing\r\nnonsense as related by Tomaschek: “He (Gelinek) declared,” says\r\nTomaschek,\r\n\r\n     as if it were an aphorism, that all of Beethoven’s compositions\r\n     were lacking in internal coherency and that not infrequently they\r\n     were overloaded. These things he looked upon as grave faults of\r\n     composition and sought to explain them from the manner in which\r\n     Beethoven went about his work, saying that he had always been\r\n     in the habit of noting every musical idea that occurred to him\r\n     upon a bit of paper which he threw into a corner of his room, and\r\n     that after a while there was a considerable pile of the memoranda\r\n     which the maid was not permitted to touch when cleaning the room.\r\n     Now when Beethoven got into a mood for work he would hunt a few\r\n     musical _motivi_ out of his treasure-heap which he thought might\r\n     serve as principal and secondary themes for the composition in\r\n     contemplation, and often his selection was not a lucky one. I\r\n     (Tomaschek) did not interrupt the flow of his passionate, yet\r\n     awkward speech, but briefly answered that I was unfamiliar with\r\n     Beethoven’s method of composing but was inclined to think that the\r\n     aberrations occasionally to be found in his compositions were to\r\n     be ascribed to his individuality, and that only an unprejudiced\r\n     and keen psychologist, who had had an opportunity to observe\r\n     Beethoven from the beginning of his artistic development to its\r\n     maturity in order gradually to familiarize himself with his views\r\n     on art, could fit himself to give the musical world an explanation\r\n     of the intellectual cross-relationships in Beethoven’s glorious\r\n     works, a thing just as impossible to his blind enthusiasts as to\r\n     his virulent opponents. Gelinek may have applied these last words\r\n     to himself, and not incorrectly.\r\n\r\nThis conversation took place in 1814, the day after a rehearsal of\r\nBeethoven’s Symphony in A--the Seventh! Gelinek’s pile of little bits\r\nof paper in the corner of the room, when touched by the wand of truth,\r\nresolves itself into blank music books, to which his new ideas were\r\ntransferred from the original slight pencil sketches, and frequently\r\nwith two or three words to indicate the kind of composition to which\r\nthey were suited. Divers anecdotes are current which pretend to give\r\nthe origin of some of the themes thus recorded and afterwards wrought\r\nout, but few judicious readers will attach much weight to most of\r\nthem. For although conceptions can sometimes be traced directly to\r\ntheir exciting causes, the musical composer can seldom say more than\r\nthat they occurred to him at such a time and place--and often not\r\neven that. It is certainly not improbable that Beethoven’s admirers\r\nmay have questioned him upon this point, as Schindler did upon the\r\n“Pastoral” Symphony, and that he was able to satisfy them; but Handel’s\r\n“Harmonious Blacksmith” may be taken as the type of most of the current\r\nstories, which only need truth to make them interesting.\r\n\r\nTo return to the sketchbooks--which performed a twofold office;\r\nbeing not alone the registers of new conceptions, but containing\r\nthe preliminary studies of the instrumental works into which they\r\nwere wrought out. The introduction to the excellent pamphlet, “Ein\r\nSkizzenbuch von Beethoven, beschrieben und in Auszügen dargestellt von\r\nGustav Nottebohm,” though properly confined by him to the single book\r\nwhich he was describing, is equally true of so many that have been\r\nexamined with care as to warrant its general application. The following\r\nextracts may be taken as true of the greater part of the sketchbooks:\r\n\r\nHOW THE SKETCHING WAS DONE\r\n\r\n     Before us (he says) lies a volume in oblong folio (_Teatro_)\r\n     of 192 pages and bearing 16 staves on each page, and, save a\r\n     few empty places, containing throughout notes and sketches in\r\n     Beethoven’s handwriting for compositions of various sorts. The\r\n     volume is bound in craftsman’s style, trimmed, and has a stout\r\n     pasteboard cover. It was bound thus before it was used or received\r\n     the notes. [Excepting the number of pages this description\r\n     applies to most of the true sketchbooks.] The sketches are for\r\n     the greater part one-part; that is, they occupy but a single\r\n     staff, only exceptionally are they on two or more staves. [In\r\n     some of the later books the proportion of sketches in two or\r\n     more parts is much greater than in this.] It is permissible to\r\n     assume in advance that they were written originally and in the\r\n     order in which they follow each other in the sketchbook. When a\r\n     cursory glance over the whole does not seem to contradict this\r\n     assumption, a careful study nevertheless compels a modification\r\n     at times. It is to be observed that generally Beethoven began a\r\n     new page with a new composition; and, moreover, that he worked\r\n     alternately or simultaneously at different movements. As a result,\r\n     different groups of sketches are crowded so closely together\r\n     that in order to find room he was obliged to make use of spaces\r\n     which had been left open, and thus eventually sketches for the\r\n     most different compositions had to be mixed together and brought\r\n     into companionship. [In some of the books “vi-” not infrequently\r\n     meets the eye. It was the one of Beethoven’s modes of keeping\r\n     the clue in the labyrinth of sketches, being part of the word\r\n     _vide_. The second syllable, “-de,” can always be found on the\r\n     same or a neighboring page.] “N.B.,” “No. 100,” “No. 500,” “No.\r\n     1000,” etc., and in later sketches “meilleur,” are common, all\r\n     which signs are explained by Schindler as being a whimsical mode\r\n     of estimating the comparative value of different musical ideas,\r\n     or of forms of the same. Again Nottebohm continues: In spite of\r\n     this confused working it is plain that Beethoven, as a rule,\r\n     was conscious from the beginning of the goal for which he was\r\n     striving, that he was true to his first concept and carried out\r\n     the projected form to the end. The contrary is also true at times,\r\n     and the sketchbook (like others) disclosed a few instances in\r\n     which Beethoven in the course was led from the form originally\r\n     conceived into another, so that eventually something different\r\n     appeared from what was planned in the first instance. (Once more.)\r\n     In general it may be observed that Beethoven in all his work begun\r\n     in the sketchbook proceeded in the most varied manner, and at\r\n     times reached his goal in a direction opposite to that upon which\r\n     he first set out. [At times] the thematic style dominates; the\r\n     first sketch breaks off abruptly with the principal subject and\r\n     the work that follows is confined to transforming and reshaping\r\n     the thematic kernel at first thrown on the paper until it appears\r\n     to be fitted for development; then the same process is undertaken\r\n     with intermediary sections; everywhere we find beginnings, never\r\n     a whole; a whole comes before us only outside of the sketchbook,\r\n     in the printed composition where sections which were scattered in\r\n     the sketchbook are brought together. [In other cases] the thematic\r\n     manner is excluded; every sketch is aimed at a unity and is\r\n     complete in itself; the very first one gives the complete outline\r\n     for a section of a movement; those that follow are then complete\r\n     reshapings of the first, as other readings directed towards a\r\n     change in the summary character, or a reformation of the whole,\r\n     an extension of the middle sections, etc. Naturally, the majority\r\n     of the sketches do not belong exclusively to either of the two\r\n     tendencies, but hover between them, now leaning toward one, now\r\n     toward the other.\r\n\r\nOne readily sees that, when the general plan of a work is clear and\r\ndistinct before the mind, it is quite indifferent in what order the\r\nvarious parts are studied; and that Beethoven simply adopted the\r\nmethod of many a dramatic and other author, who sketches his scenes\r\nor chapters not in course but as mood, fancy or opportunity dictates.\r\nIt is equally evident that the composer could have half a dozen works\r\nupon his hands at the same time, not merely without disadvantage to\r\nany one of them, but to the gain of all, since he could turn to one\r\nor another as the spirit of composition impelled; like the author\r\nof a profound literary work, who relieves and recreates his mind\r\nby varying his labors, and executes his grand task all the more\r\nsatisfactorily, because he, from time to time, refreshes himself by\r\nturning his attention to other and lighter topics. When Beethoven\r\nwrites to Wegeler: “As I am writing now I often compose three or four\r\npieces at once,” he could have referred only to the preliminary studies\r\nof the sketchbooks. Sometimes, it is true, works were laid aside\r\nincomplete after he had begun the task of writing them out in full,\r\nand finished when occasion demanded; but as a rule his practice was\r\nquite different, viz.: All the parts of a work having been thus studied\r\nuntil he had determined upon the form, character and style of every\r\nimportant division and subdivision, and recorded the results in his\r\nsketchbook by a few of the first measures, followed by “etc.” or “and\r\nso on,” the labor of composition may be said to have been finished,\r\nand there remained only the task of writing out the clean copy of what\r\nnow existed full and complete in his mind, and of making such minor\r\ncorrections and improvements as might occur to him on revision. The\r\nmanuscripts show that these were sometimes very numerous, though they\r\nrarely extend to any change in the form or to any alteration in the\r\ngrand effect except to heighten it, or render it more unexpected or\r\nexciting. When upon reflection he was dissatisfied with a movement\r\nas a whole he seems rarely to have attempted its improvement by mere\r\ncorrection, choosing rather to discard it at once and compose a new one\r\nbased either upon the same themes or upon entirely new motives. The\r\nseveral overtures to “Fidelio” are illustrations of both procedures.\r\n\r\nThe sketches of the greater part of Beethoven’s songs, after the Bonn\r\nperiod, are preserved, and prove with what extreme care he wrought out\r\nhis melodies. The sketchbook analysed by Nottebohm affords a curious\r\nillustration in Matthison’s “Opferlied,” the melody being written out\r\nin full not less than six times, the theme in substance remaining\r\nunchanged. Absolute correctness of accent, emphasis, rhythm--of\r\nprosody, in short--was with him a leading object; and various papers,\r\nas well as the Conversation Books, attest his familiarity with metrical\r\nsigns and his scrupulous obedience to metrical laws. Since the shameful\r\nmutilation and dispersion of Beethoven’s manuscripts at the time of\r\ntheir sale, probably no one person has been able to trace and examine\r\nhalf of the sketchbooks; still, enough have come under observation\r\nduring the researches for this work to establish with reasonable\r\ncertainty these points:\r\n\r\nI. That each sketchbook was filled in pretty regular course from\r\nbeginning to end before a new one was taken.\r\n\r\nII. That had the collection been kept entire it would have afforded the\r\nmeans of determining with a good degree of certainty the chronology of\r\nmost of his instrumental works, after coming to Vienna, as to their\r\nfirst conception and studies--excluding, of course, those which, in one\r\nform or another, he brought with him from Bonn.\r\n\r\nIII. That the more important vocal compositions were studied separately.\r\n\r\nIV. That only from the sketchbooks can an adequate idea of the vast\r\nfertility of Beethoven’s genius be formed. They are in music, like\r\nHawthorne’s “Notebooks” in literature, the record of a never ceasing\r\nflow of new thoughts and ideas, until death sealed the fountain\r\nforever. There are themes and hints, never used, for all kinds\r\nof instrumental compositions, from the trifles, which he called\r\n“Bagatelles,” to symphonies, evidently intended to be as different from\r\nthose we know as they are from each other; and these hints are in such\r\nnumbers, that those which can be traced in the published works are\r\nperhaps much the smaller proportion of the whole. Whoever has the will\r\nand opportunity to devote an hour or two to an examination of a few of\r\nthese monuments of Beethoven’s inventive genius, will easily comprehend\r\nthe remark which he made near the close of his life: “It seems to me\r\nthat I have just begun to compose!”[90]\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS OF APPROACHING DEAFNESS\r\n\r\nOne topic more demands brief notice before closing this chapter. In the\r\n“Merrymaking of the Countryfolk” of Beethoven’s “Pastoral” Symphony, at\r\nthe point where the fun grows most fast and furious and the excitement\r\nrises to its height, an ominous sound, as of distant thunder, gives\r\nthe first faint warning of the coming storm. So in the life of the\r\ncomposer at the moment of that highest success and prosperity, which\r\nwe have labored to place vividly before the mind of the reader, just\r\nwhen he could first look forward with well-grounded confidence to\r\nthe noblest gratification of a musician’s honorable ambition, a new\r\nand discordant element thrust itself into the harmony of his life.\r\nThis was the symptoms of approaching deafness. His own account fixes\r\ntheir appearance in the year 1799; then they were still so feeble and\r\nintermittent, as to have caused him at first no serious anxiety; but\r\nin another year they had assumed so much the appearance of a chronic\r\nand increasing evil, as to compel him to abandon plans for travel\r\nwhich he had formed, and for which he was preparing himself, with\r\ngreat industry and perseverance, to appear in the twofold capacity of\r\nvirtuoso and composer. Instead, therefore, in 1801, of having “long\r\nsince journeyed through half the world,” he, for two years, had been\r\nconfined to Vienna or its immediate vicinity, vainly seeking relief\r\nfrom surgeons and physicians.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to imagine calamities greater than that which\r\nnow threatened Beethoven--as, the loss of sight to a Raphael or\r\nRubens in the height of their fame and powers; a partial paralysis or\r\nother incurable disease of the brain cutting short the career of a\r\nShakespeare or Goethe, a Bacon or Kant, a Newton or Humboldt. Better\r\nthe untimely fate of a Buckle, than to live long years of unavailing\r\nregret over the blasted hopes and promise of early manhood. In such\r\ncases there remains no resource; hope itself is dead. But to Beethoven,\r\neven if his worst fears should prove prophetic and his infirmity at\r\nlength close all prospects of a career as virtuoso and conductor, the\r\nfield of composition still remained open. This he knew, and it saved\r\nhim from utter despair. Who can say that the world has not been a\r\ngainer by a misfortune which stirred the profoundest depths of his\r\nbeing and compelled the concentration of all his powers into one\r\ndirection?\r\n\r\nAs the disease made progress and the prospect of relief became less,\r\nnotwithstanding a grief and anxiety which caused him such mental agony\r\nas even to induce the thought of suicide, he so well succeeded in\r\nkeeping it concealed from all but a few intimate and faithful friends,\r\nthat no notice whatever is to be found of it until 1802 except in\r\npapers from his own hand. They form a very touching contrast to his\r\nletters to other correspondents. Neither the head nor the heart is to\r\nbe envied of the man who can read them without emotion. The two most\r\nimportant are letters to Wegeler giving full details of his case;\r\ndoubly valuable because they are not merely letters to a friend, but\r\nan elaborate account of the symptoms and medical treatment of his\r\ndisease, made to a physician of high standing who thoroughly understood\r\nthe constitution of the patient. They are therefore alike significant\r\nfor what they contain and for what they omit. No hypothesis as to the\r\ncause of the evil can be entertained, which is discordant with them.\r\nReserving them, however, for their proper places in the order of time,\r\na story or two inconsistent with them may here be disposed of.\r\n\r\nThe so-called Fischoff Manuscript says:\r\n\r\nTHEORIES AS TO THE LOSS OF HEARING\r\n\r\n     In the year 1796, Beethoven, on a hot summer day, came greatly\r\n     overheated to his home, threw open doors and windows, disrobed\r\n     down to his trousers and cooled himself in a draft at the open\r\n     window. The consequence was a dangerous sickness which, on his\r\n     convalescence, settled in his organs of hearing, and from this\r\n     time his deafness steadily increased.\r\n\r\nIn this passage both the date and the averment are irreconcilable with\r\nthe letters to Wegeler.\r\n\r\nDr. Weissenbach, in his “Reise zum Congress” (1814), gives what appears\r\nto be the same story but in fewer words. “He (Beethoven) once endured a\r\nfearful attack of typhus. From this time dates the decay of his nervous\r\nsystem, and probably also the, to him, great misfortune of the loss of\r\nhearing.” Neither a typhus nor a typhoid fever is a matter of a few\r\ndays or weeks if severe; and the chronology of our narrative is, to\r\nsay the least, so far fixed and certain as to exclude the possibility\r\nof his having passed through any very serious illness of that nature\r\nsince he came to Vienna. But it is not at all improbable that, in 1784\r\nor 1785, he may have been a victim to this frightful disorder, and that\r\nit may have been the cause of his melancholy condition of health at\r\nthe time of his mother’s death, and of the chronic diarrhœa with which\r\nhe was so long troubled. True, there is no record of such an illness;\r\nbut that proves nothing. There is no record that he passed through an\r\nattack of small-pox, except that which the disease left upon his face.\r\n\r\nBut the most extraordinary and inexplicable account of the origin\r\nof his deafness is that given by Beethoven himself to the English\r\npianist, Charles Neate, in 1815. Mr. Neate was once urging Beethoven\r\nto visit England and mentioned as a farther inducement the great\r\nskill of certain English physicians in treating diseases of the ear,\r\nassuring him that he might cherish hopes of relief. Beethoven replied\r\nin substance as follows: “No; I have already had all sorts of medical\r\nadvice. I shall never be cured--I will tell you how it happened. I was\r\nonce busy writing an opera--\r\n\r\nNeate: “Fidelio?”\r\n\r\nBeethoven: “No. It was not ‘Fidelio.’ I had a very ill-tempered,\r\ntroublesome _primo tenore_ to deal with. I had already written two\r\ngrand airs to the same text, with which he was dissatisfied, and now\r\na third which, upon trial, he seemed to approve and took away with\r\nhim. I thanked the stars that I was at length rid of him and sat down\r\nimmediately to a work which I had laid aside for those airs and which\r\nI was anxious to finish. I had not been half an hour at work, when I\r\nheard a knock at my door, which I at once recognized as that of my\r\n_primo tenore_. I sprang up from my table under such an excitement\r\nof rage, that, as the man entered the room, I threw myself upon the\r\nfloor as they do upon the stage (here B. spread out his arms and made\r\na gesture of illustration), coming down upon my hands. When I arose I\r\nfound myself deaf and have been so ever since. The physicians say, the\r\nnerve is injured.”\r\n\r\nThat Beethoven really related this strange story cannot be questioned;\r\nthe word of the venerable Charles Neate to the author is sufficient on\r\nthat point. What is to be thought of it, is a very different matter.\r\nHere at least it may stand without comment.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[89] The number of known letters and documents has grown greatly since\r\nThayer wrote these words. Kalischer’s Collection numbers over 1200\r\nand Emerich Kastner gives the first lines of 1380 in Frimmel’s second\r\n“Beethoven Jahrbuch” published in 1909.\r\n\r\n[90] Opportunities for studying Beethoven’s sketchbooks have greatly\r\nincreased since Mr. Thayer wrote these words. Nottebohm who rendered\r\nan incalculable service to all students of the great composer after\r\nthe book from which our author quotes, published a volume entitled\r\n“Beethoveniana” in 1872, and a second entitled “Zweite Beethoveniana”\r\nin 1887. To these the revisors of this biography have repeatedly\r\nreferred in tracing the history of Beethoven’s compositions. A\r\ncollection of sketches formerly owned by J. N. Kafka and now in the\r\nBritish Museum was described by Mr. J. S. Shedlock in “The Musical\r\nTimes” (July to December, 1892). A volume containing sketches for\r\nthe last quartets is at the present writing in the possession of Mr.\r\nCecilio de Roda of Madrid and was described by the “Rivista Italiana”\r\n(Nos. XI-XIV, 1907) and also published in pamphlet form under the title\r\n“Un Quadrena di autografi di Beethoven del 1825.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII\r\n\r\n     Beethoven’s Brothers--His First Concert on His Own Account--Punto\r\n     and the Sonata for Horn--Steibelt Confounded--E. A. Förster and\r\n     the First Quartets--The Septet and First Symphony--Beethoven’s\r\n     Homes--Hoffmeister--Compositions and Publications of 1800.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to conceive upon what ground the opinion became current,\r\nas it did, that Beethoven in the year 1800 and for several years to\r\ncome was still burdened with the support of his brothers--young men now\r\nrespectively in their 26th and 24th years. This mistake as to Johann\r\nhas already been exposed. Leaving Ludwig for the first quarter of this\r\nyear doubly busy--having, in addition to his usual occupations, his\r\npreparations to make for a grand concert in April--we turn, for a page,\r\nto his brother Carl.\r\n\r\nIn the “Hof- und Staats-Schematismus” for the year 1800, at the end of\r\nthe list of persons employed in the “K. K. Universal-Staatschuldenkasse”\r\nare the names of two “Praktikanten”; the first is “Mr. Carl v.\r\nBeethoven lives in the Sterngasse, 484.” In the same publication\r\nappears a new department or bureau of the above-named office called the\r\n“K. K. n. öst. Klassen-Steuer-Kasse” and the second of the three bureau\r\nofficers is “Mr. Carl v. Beethoven lives unterm Tuchladen, 605.”\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that, while simply “Praktikant,” he may have\r\nneeded occasional pecuniary aid, but his preferment to the place of\r\n“Kassa-Officier” rendered him independent. This appointment is dated\r\nMarch 24th, 1800, and gave him a salary of 250 florins. Small as the\r\nsum now appears, it was amply sufficient, with what he could earn by\r\nteaching music (and the brother of the great Beethoven could have no\r\nlack of pupils), to enable him to live comfortably. In fact, he was\r\nbetter off than many a colleague in the public service, who still with\r\ncare and economy managed to live respectably. It may therefore be\r\nconfidently asserted that Beethoven was henceforth relieved of all\r\ncare on account of Carl, as of Johann, until the bankruptcy of the\r\ngovernment and Carl’s broken health many years later, made fraternal\r\nassistance indispensable.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this year Carl had tried his fortune as a\r\ncomposer--but probably with slender profit, since no second venture\r\nhas been discovered. Six minuets, six “Deutsche” and six contradances\r\nby him are advertised in the “Wiener Zeitung” of January 11, in double\r\neditions, one for clavier and one for two violins and violoncello.\r\nThe concert for which Beethoven had been preparing during the winter\r\ntook place on the 2d of April. It was his first public appearance for\r\nhis own benefit in Vienna, and, so far as is known, anywhere except\r\nin Prague. All that is now to be ascertained in relation to it is\r\ncontained in the advertisement, in the programme, and in a single\r\nnotice, sent to the “Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung.” The programme,\r\nwhich was in the possession of Madame van Beethoven (widow of the\r\ncomposer’s nephew) is as follows:\r\n\r\n     To-day, Wednesday, April 2nd, 1800, Herr _Ludwig van Beethoven_\r\n     will have the honor to give a grand concert for his benefit in the\r\n     Royal Imperial Court Theatre beside the Burg. The pieces which\r\n     will be performed are the following:\r\n\r\n     1. A grand symphony by the late Chapelmaster Mozart.\r\n\r\n     2. An aria from “The Creation” by the Princely Chapelmaster Herr\r\n     Haydn, sung by Mlle. Saal.\r\n\r\n     3. A grand Concerto for the Pianoforte, played and composed by\r\n     Herr _Ludwig van Beethoven_.\r\n\r\n     4. A Septet, most humbly and obediently dedicated to Her Majesty\r\n     the Empress, and composed by Herr _Ludwig van Beethoven_ for\r\n     four stringed and three wind-instruments, played by Messrs.\r\n     Schuppanzigh, Schreiber, Schindlecker, Bär, Nickel, Matauschek and\r\n     Dietzel.\r\n\r\n     5. A Duet from Haydn’s “Creation,” sung by Mr. and Mlle. Saal.\r\n\r\n     6. Herr _Ludwig van Beethoven_ will improvise on the pianoforte.\r\n\r\n     7. A new grand symphony with complete orchestra, composed by Herr\r\n     _Ludwig van Beethoven_.\r\n\r\n     Tickets for boxes and stalls are to be had of Herr van Beethoven\r\n     at his lodgings in the Tiefen Graben, No. 241, third storey, and\r\n     of the box-keeper.\r\n\r\n     Prices of admission are as usual.\r\n\r\n     The beginning is at half-past 6 o’clock.\r\n\r\nThe correspondent of the “Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung” described\r\nthe concert as the most interesting affair of its kind given for a\r\nlong time, said the new concerto had “many beauties, especially in the\r\nfirst two movements,” praised the “taste and feeling” exhibited in the\r\nSeptet, and in the Symphony found “much art, novelty and wealth of\r\nideas”; but, he continues: “unfortunately there was too much use of\r\nthe wind-instruments, so that the music sounded more as if written for\r\na military band than an orchestra.” The rest of the notice is devoted\r\nto scolding the band for inattention to the conductor. Which of the\r\npianoforte Concertos Beethoven played on this occasion is nowhere\r\nintimated. The Symphony in C soon became known throughout Germany;\r\nwhile the Septet achieved a sudden popularity so widely extended and\r\nenduring as at length to become an annoyance to the composer.[91]\r\n\r\nA PUBLIC CONCERT WITH PUNTO\r\n\r\nBefore the month was out Beethoven again played in public in a concert\r\ngiven by Johann Stich, known as Punto. This Bohemian virtuoso, after\r\nseveral years of wandering, had lately come to Vienna from Paris,\r\n_via_ Munich. As a performer upon the horn he was unrivalled by\r\nany predecessor or contemporary; but as a composer he was beneath\r\ncriticism. Beethoven’s delight in any one whose skill afforded him\r\nnew experience of the powers and possible effects of any orchestral\r\ninstrument is known to the reader. Nothing more natural, therefore,\r\nthan his readiness to compose a sonata for himself and Punto to be\r\nplayed at the latter’s concert on April 18th. Ries informs us that\r\n“though the concert was announced with the Sonata the latter was not\r\nyet begun. Beethoven began the work the day before the performance and\r\nit was ready for the concert.” His habit of merely sketching his own\r\npart and of trusting to his memory and the inspiration of the moment,\r\neven when producing his grand Concertos in public, probably rendered\r\nhim good service on this occasion. The “Allgemeine Musikzeitung” (III,\r\n704) preserves also the interesting fact that owing to the enthusiastic\r\napplause the Sonata was immediately repeated.\r\n\r\nApril 27th was the anniversary of the day on which Maximilian Franz\r\nentered Bonn to assume the duties of Elector and Archbishop. Sixteen\r\nyears had passed and on this day he, with a small retinue, again\r\nentered Vienna. He took refuge “in an Esterhazy villa in a suburb,”\r\nwhile the small château near which now stands the railway station at\r\nHetzendorf, behind Schönbrunn Garden, was preparing for his residence;\r\nwhither he soon removed, and where for the present we leave him.\r\n\r\nAt the end of February or early in March, the charlatan Daniel Steibelt\r\ngave a concert in Prague which brought him in 1800 florins, and in\r\nApril or May, “having finished his speculation, he went to Vienna,\r\nhis purse filled with ducats, where he was knocked in the head by the\r\npianist Beethoven,” says Tomaschek. Ries relates how:\r\n\r\n     When Steibelt came to Vienna with his great name, some of\r\n     Beethoven’s friends grew alarmed lest he do injury to the latter’s\r\n     reputation. Steibelt did not visit him; they met first time one\r\n     evening at the house of Count Fries, where Beethoven produced his\r\n     new Trio in B-flat major for Pianoforte, Clarinet and Violoncello\r\n     (Op. 11), for the first time.[92] There is no opportunity for\r\n     particular display on the part of the pianist in this Trio.\r\n     Steibelt listened to it with a sort of condescension, uttered a\r\n     few compliments to Beethoven and felt sure of his victory. He\r\n     played a Quintet of his own composition, improvised, and made a\r\n     good deal of effect with his tremolos, which were then something\r\n     entirely new. Beethoven could not be induced to play again. A week\r\n     later there was again a concert at Count Fries’s; Steibelt again\r\n     played a quintet which had a good deal of success. He also played\r\n     an improvisation (which had, obviously, been carefully prepared)\r\n     and chose the same theme on which Beethoven had written variations\r\n     in his Trio.[93] This incensed the admirers of Beethoven and\r\n     him; he had to go to the pianoforte and improvise. He went in\r\n     his usual (I might say, ill-bred) manner to the instrument as if\r\n     half-pushed, picked up the violoncello part of Steibelt’s quintet\r\n     in passing, placed it (intentionally?) upon the stand upside down\r\n     and with one finger drummed a theme out of the first few measures.\r\n     Insulted and angered he improvised in such a manner that Steibelt\r\n     left the room before he finished, would never again meet him and,\r\n     indeed, made it a condition that Beethoven should not be invited\r\n     before accepting an offer.\r\n\r\nIt was, and still is, the custom at Vienna for all whose vocations\r\nand pecuniary circumstances render it possible, to spend all or some\r\nportion of the summer months in the country. The aristocracies of birth\r\nand wealth retire to their country-seats, live in villas for the season\r\nor join the throngs at the great watering-places; other classes find\r\nrefuge in the villages and hamlets which abound in the lovely environs\r\nof the city, where many a neat cottage is built for their use and where\r\nthe peasants generally have a spare room or two, cleanly kept and\r\nneatly furnished. Beethoven’s habit of escaping from town during the\r\nhot months was, therefore, nothing peculiar to him. We have reached\r\nthe point whence, with little if any interruption, Beethoven can be\r\nfollowed from house to house, in city and country, through the rest of\r\nhis life; a matter of great value in fixing the true dates of important\r\nletters and determining the chronology of his life and works--but for\r\nthe first seven years the record is very incomplete.\r\n\r\nVARIOUS DWELLING PLACES IN VIENNA\r\n\r\nCarl Holz told Jahn: “He (Beethoven) lived at first in a little\r\nattic-room in the house of the book-binder Strauss in the Alservorstadt,\r\nwhere he had a miserable time.” This is one of the facts which an\r\ninquisitive young man like Holz would naturally learn of the master\r\nduring the short period when he was his factotum. This attic-room must\r\nhave been soon changed for the room “on the ground-floor” mentioned\r\nin a previous chapter. An undated note of van Swieten is directed\r\nto Beethoven at “No. 45 Alsergasse, at Prince Lichnowsky’s”; but in\r\nthe Vienna directory for 1804 no street is so named, and the only\r\nnumber 45 in the “Alsergrund” is in the Lämmelgasse, property of Georg\r\nMusial; but Prince Josef Lichnowsky is named as owner of No. 125 in\r\nthe Hauptstrasse of that suburb. This was the same house; it had\r\nmerely changed numbers. The site is now occupied by the house No. 30\r\nAlserstrasse. Thence Beethoven went as a guest to the house occupied by\r\nPrince Lichnowsky. In May, 1795, Beethoven, in advertising the Trios,\r\nOp. 1, gives the “residence of the author” as the “Ogylisches Haus in\r\nthe Kreuzgasse behind the Minorite church, No. 35 in the first storey”;\r\nbut that is no reason to think that Prince Lichnowsky then lived there.\r\nWhere Beethoven was during the next few years has not been ascertained,\r\nbut, as has been seen by the concert bill on a preceding page, he was\r\nduring the winter of 1799-1800 in the Tiefen Graben “in a very high\r\nand narrow house,” as Czerny wrote to F. Luib.[94] For the summer of\r\n1800, he took quarters for himself and servant in one of those houses\r\nin Unter-Döbling, an hour’s walk, perhaps, from town, to which the\r\nreadiest access is by the bridge over the brook on the North side of\r\nthe Döbling hospital for the insane. The wife of a distinguished Vienna\r\nadvocate occupied with her children another part of the same house.\r\nOne of these children was Grillparzer, afterward famous as a poet. The\r\nzeal with which Beethoven at this period labored to perfect his\r\npianoforte playing, and his dislike to being listened to, have been\r\nalready noted. Madame Grillparzer was a lady of fine taste and\r\nculture, fond of music and therefore able to appreciate the skill of\r\nher fellow-lodger, but ignorant of his aversion to listeners. Her\r\nson, in 1861, still remembered Beethoven’s incessant practice and\r\nhis mother’s habit of standing outside her own door to enjoy his\r\nplaying. This continued for some time; but one day Beethoven sprang\r\nfrom the instrument to the door, opened it, looked out to see if any\r\none was listening, and unfortunately discovered the lady. From that\r\nmoment he played no more. Madame Grillparzer, thus made aware of his\r\nsensitiveness on this point, informed him through his servant that\r\nthenceforth her door into the common passageway should be kept locked,\r\nand she and her family would solely use another. It was of no avail;\r\nBeethoven played no more.\r\n\r\nAnother authentic and characteristic anecdote can belong only to this\r\nsummer. There lived in a house hard by a peasant of no very good\r\nreputation, who had a daughter remarkably beautiful, but also not of\r\nthe best fame. Beethoven was greatly captivated by her and was in the\r\nhabit of stopping to gaze at her when he passed by where she was at\r\nwork in farmyard or field. She, however, made no return of his evident\r\nliking and only laughed at his admiration. On one occasion the father\r\nwas arrested for engaging in a brawl and imprisoned. Beethoven took\r\nthe man’s part and went to the magistrates to obtain his release. Not\r\nsucceeding, he became angry and abusive, and in the end would have been\r\narrested for his impertinence but for the strong representations made\r\nby some, who knew him, of his position in society and of the high rank,\r\ninfluence and power of his friends.\r\n\r\nThroughout this period of Beethoven’s life, each summer is\r\ndistinguished by some noble composition, completed, or nearly so,\r\nso that on his return to the city it was ready for revision and his\r\ncopyist. Free from the demands of society, his time was his own; his\r\nfancy was quickened, his inspiration strengthened, in field and forest\r\nlabor was a delight. The most important work of the master bears in his\r\nown hand the date, 1800, and may reasonably be supposed to have been\r\nthe labor of this summer. It is the Concerto in C minor for Pianoforte\r\nand Orchestra, Op. 37.\r\n\r\nDOLEŽALEK AND HOFFMEISTER\r\n\r\nAt the approach of autumn Beethoven returned to his old quarters in the\r\nTiefen Graben. In this year Krumpholz introduced to him Johann Emanuel\r\n(possibly Johann Nepomuk Emanuel) Doležalek, a young man of 20 years,\r\nborn in Chotieborz in Bohemia, who had come to Vienna to take lessons\r\nfrom Albrechtsberger. He played the pianoforte and violoncello, was a\r\ncapable musician, in his youth a rather popular composer of Bohemian\r\nsongs and then, for half a century, one of the best teachers in the\r\ncapital. Toward the close of his life he was frequently occupied\r\nwith the arrangement of private concerts, chiefly quartet parties,\r\nfor Prince Czartoryski and other prominent persons. As long as he\r\nlived he was an enthusiastic admirer of Beethoven, and enjoyed the\r\nfriendship of the composer till his death. Among his observations are\r\nthe statements concerning the hatred of Beethoven felt by the Vienna\r\nmusicians already noted. Koželuch, he relates, threw the C minor Trio\r\nat his (Doležalek’s) feet when the latter played it to him. Speaking\r\nof Beethoven, Koželuch said to Haydn: “We would have done that\r\ndifferently, wouldn’t we, Papa?” and Haydn answered, smilingly, “Yes,\r\nwe would have done that differently.” Haydn, says Doležalek, could not\r\nquite reconcile himself with Beethoven’s music. It was Doležalek who\r\nwitnessed the oft-told scene in the Swan tavern when Beethoven insisted\r\non paying without having eaten.\r\n\r\nOne of the most prolific and popular composers whom Beethoven found in\r\nVienna was Franz Anton Hoffmeister, “Chapelmaster and R. I. licensed\r\nMusic, Art and Book Seller.” He was an immigrant from the Neckar valley\r\nand (born 1754) much older than Beethoven, to whom he had extended a\r\nwarm sympathy and friendship, doubly valuable from his somewhat similar\r\nexperience as a young student in Vienna. This is evident from the whole\r\ntone of their correspondence. In 1800, Hoffmeister left Vienna and in\r\nLeipzig formed a copartnership with Ambrosius Kühnel, organist of the\r\nElectoral Saxon Court Chapel, and established a publishing house there,\r\nstill retaining his business in Vienna. As late as December 5, 1800,\r\nhis signature is as above given; but on the 1st of January, 1801, the\r\nadvertisements in the public press announce the firm of “Hoffmeister\r\nand Kühnel, _Bureau de Musique_ in Leipzig.” Since 1814 the firm name\r\nhas been C. F. Peters. Knowing Beethoven personally and so intimately,\r\nit is alike creditable to the talents of the one and the taste and\r\nappreciation of the other that Hoffmeister, immediately upon organizing\r\nhis new publishing house, should have asked him for manuscripts. To his\r\nletter he received an answer dated Dec. 15, 1800, in which Beethoven\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     ... Per _primo_ you must know that I am very sorry that you, my\r\n     dear brother in music, did not earlier let me know something (of\r\n     your doings) so that I might have marketed my quartets with you,\r\n     as well as many other pieces which I have sold, but if Mr. Brother\r\n     is as conscientious as many other honest engravers who grave\r\n     us poor composers to death, you will know how to derive profit\r\n     from them when they appear. I will now set forth in brief what\r\n     Mr. Brother can have from me. I^{mo} a Septet _per il Violino_,\r\n     _Viola_, _Violoncello_, _Contrabasso_, _Clarinetto_, _Corno_,\r\n     _Fagotto_--_tutti obligati_. (I cannot write anything not obligato\r\n     for I came into this world with an obligato accompaniment.) This\r\n     Septet has pleased greatly. For more frequent use the three\r\n     wind-instruments, namely _Fagotto_, _Clarinetto_ and _Corno_\r\n     might be transcribed for another violin, viola and violoncello.\r\n     II^o A grand Symphony for full orchestra. III^o A Concerto for\r\n     pianoforte which I do not claim to be one of my best, as well as\r\n     another one which will be published here by Mollo (this for the\r\n     information of the Leipzig critics) because I am for the present\r\n     keeping the better ones for myself until I make a tour; but it\r\n     will not disgrace you to publish it. IV^o A grand Solo Sonata.[95]\r\n     That is all that I can give you at this moment. A little later you\r\n     may have a Quintet for stringed instruments as well as, probably,\r\n     Quartets and other things which I have not now with me. In your\r\n     reply you might set the prices and as you are neither a Jew nor an\r\n     Italian, nor I either one or the other, we shall no doubt come to\r\n     an understanding.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST STRING QUARTETS\r\n\r\nThe reference to the Quartets, Op. 18, in this letter, taken in\r\nconnection with the apologies for long delay in writing, indicates\r\nconclusively enough that at least the first set, the first three, had\r\nbeen placed in the hands of Mollo and Co. early in the autumn, and it\r\nis barely possible, not probable, that they had already been issued\r\nfrom the press.[96] The importance of these Quartets in the history\r\nboth of Beethoven and of chamber music renders very desirable more\r\ndefinite information upon their origin and dates of composition than\r\nthe incomplete, unsatisfactory and not always harmonious data already\r\nknown, afford. The original manuscripts appear to have been lost.\r\n\r\nVon Lenz quotes in his “Critical Catalogue of Beethoven’s Works” an\r\nanecdote from a pamphlet printed at Dorpat in which is related:\r\n\r\n     After Beethoven had composed his well-known String Quartet in F\r\n     major he played for his friend (Amenda) (on the pianoforte?) the\r\n     glorious _Adagio_ (D minor, 9-8 time) and asked him what thought\r\n     had been awakened by it. “It pictured for me the parting of two\r\n     lovers,” was the answer. “Good!” remarked Beethoven, “I thought\r\n     of the scene in the burial vault in ‘Romeo and Juliet’.”\r\n\r\nThis Quartet existed, then, before Amenda left Vienna. Czerny says\r\nin his notes for Jahn: “Of the first six Violin Quartets that in D\r\nmajor, No. 3 in print, was the very first composed by Beethoven. On\r\nthe advice of Schuppanzigh he called that in F major No. 1, although\r\nit was composed later.” Ries confirms this: “Of his Violin Quartets,\r\nOp. 18, he composed that in D major first of all. That in F major,\r\nwhich now precedes it, was originally the third.”[97] _Nota bene_ that\r\nneither Czerny nor Ries spoke from personal observation at the time\r\nof composition; they must both have learned the fact from Beethoven\r\nhimself, or, more probably, from dates on the original manuscripts.\r\nA criticism of three quartets which appeared in the “Allg. Mus.\r\nZeitung” in 1799, which failed to give the name of the composer, has\r\nbeen applied by some writers (by Langhans in his History of Music,\r\nfor instance) to Beethoven’s Op. 18; but erroneously. They were the\r\nworks of Emanuel Aloys Förster (born January 26, 1748, in Neurath,\r\nUpper Silesia, died November 12, 1823, in Vienna), a musician who was\r\nso highly esteemed by Beethoven that, on one occasion at least, he\r\ncalled him his “old master.” The phrase can easily be interpreted to\r\nmean that Beethoven found instruction in Förster’s chamber music which\r\nhe heard at the soirées of Prince Lichnowsky and other art-patrons.\r\nFörster’s compositions, not many of which have been preserved in print,\r\nare decidedly Beethovenish in character. His eldest son, who in 1870\r\nwas still living in Trieste, remembered Beethoven perfectly well from\r\n1803 to 1813, and communicated to the author of this biography some\r\nreminiscences well worth preserving. It is known from other sources\r\nthat Beethoven, after the retirement of Albrechtsberger, considered\r\nFörster to be the first of all the Vienna teachers of counterpoint and\r\ncomposition, and this is confirmed by the son’s statement that it was\r\non Beethoven’s advice that he sent to press the compendious “Anleitung\r\nzum Generalbass” which Breitkopf and Härtel published in 1805. A year\r\nor two later, Count Rasoumowsky applied to Beethoven for instruction\r\nin musical theory and especially in quartet composition. Beethoven\r\nabsolutely refused, but so strongly recommended his friend Förster,\r\nthat the latter was engaged. Förster’s dwelling in all those years was\r\na favorite resort of the principal composers and dilettanti. Thither\r\ncame Beethoven; Zmeskall, a very precise gentleman with abundant white\r\nhair; Schuppanzigh, a short fat man with a huge belly; Weiss, tall\r\nand thin; Linke, the lame violoncellist, Henry Eppinger, the Jewish\r\nviolin dilettante, the youthful Mayseder, J. N. Hummel, and others.\r\nThe regular periods of these quartet meetings were Sunday at noon,\r\nand the evening of Thursday; but Beethoven in those years often spent\r\nother evenings with Förster, “when the conversation usually turned upon\r\nmusical theory and composition.” Notwithstanding the wide difference\r\nin their ages (22 years), their friendship was cordial and sincere.\r\nThe elder not only appreciated and admired the genius of the younger,\r\nbut honored him as a man; and spoke of him as being not only a great\r\nmusical composer, but, however at times rough in manner and harsh, even\r\nrude, in speech, of a most honorable and noble nature. Add to all this\r\nthe fact, that Beethoven in later years recommended Förster to pupils\r\nas his own “old master,” and it is no forced and unnatural inference,\r\nthat he (Beethoven) had studied quartet composition with him, as he had\r\ncounterpoint with Albrechtsberger, and operatic writing with Salieri.\r\nNor is this inference weakened--it is rather strengthened--by some\r\npoints in what now follows:\r\n\r\nThe earliest mention of a string quartet in connection with Beethoven\r\nis that proposal by Count Appony cited from Wegeler which led to no\r\ninstant result. Then comes a passage from a letter to Amenda: “Do not\r\ngive your Quartet to anybody, because I have greatly changed it, having\r\nlearned how to write quartets properly.” Had he learned from study\r\nunder Förster?\r\n\r\nSKETCHES FOR THE FIRST QUARTETS\r\n\r\nThe original manuscripts being lost, further chronological notices\r\nconcerning them must be sought for in the sketchbooks. Here Nottebohm\r\ncomes to our assistance. In the Petter collection at Vienna there\r\nare sketches for the last movement of the G major Quartet, the last\r\nmovement of the B-flat Quartet (among them one which was discarded),\r\nboth deviating from the printed form more or less, and one for the\r\nlast movement of the F major Quartet, this approaching pretty closely\r\nthe ultimate form; thus this quartet was farther advanced than the\r\nothers. Associated with this sketch are sketches for the Sonata in\r\nB-flat, Op. 22, and for the easy Variations in G major which were begun\r\nwhile work was in progress on the last movement of the Quartet in G.\r\nBeethoven worked simultaneously on the first movement of Op. 22 and the\r\nscherzo of the first Quartet; while working on the last movement of\r\nthe Quartet in B-flat the rondo of the Sonata was begun. The sketches\r\ndate from 1799 and 1800. Inasmuch as they occur before those for the\r\nHorn Sonata, which was composed very hurriedly and performed on April\r\n18, 1800, the sketches were doubtless written earlier. One of the\r\nvariations of the Quartet in A major was sketched much earlier--in\r\n1794 or 1795. A little sketch for the first movement of the F major\r\nQuartet found beside sketches for the Violin Sonata, Op. 24, no doubt\r\nbelongs to the revised form of the Quartet. In a sketchbook formerly\r\nin the possession of Grassnick in Berlin, there are sketches for the\r\nQuartet in D major which are near the ultimate form, except that there\r\nis a different theme for the last movement. Then comes a beginning in\r\nG major inscribed “Quartet 2,” the germ of the theme of the second\r\nQuartet. There was, therefore, at the time no second Quartet, and\r\nthat in D is the first. There follows “Der Kuss,” sketches for the\r\n“Opferlied,” the Rondo in G major, Op. 51, No. 2, to a passage from\r\nSchiller’s “Ode to Joy,” to Gellert’s “Meine Lebenszeit verstreicht,”\r\nin G minor, to an intermezzo for pianoforte, to the revised form\r\nof the B-flat Concerto (which he played in Prague in 1798), and to\r\nvarious songs. The indications are, therefore, that the sketches were\r\nwritten in 1798. Then come sketches for the variations on “La stessa,\r\nla stessissima,” which originated and were published in the beginning\r\nof 1799, and after them extended sketches for the first movement of\r\nthe F major Quartet, of which those belonging to the first movement\r\nare in an advanced stage, those for the second movement less so. A few\r\nsketches for a “third” quartet (thus specified) which were not used\r\nshow that there was no third at the time; therefore, the Quartet in F\r\nis the second and was planned in 1799. Another sketchbook contains the\r\ncontinuation of the sketches for the F major Quartet, and, indeed, for\r\nall the movements; then an unused sketch for a “third” quartet (still\r\nnot yet in existence), then to two songs by Goethe (one “Ich denke\r\ndein”), then to the movements of the G major Quartet, which is thus\r\nindicated to have been the third (the intermezzo in the second movement\r\nwas conceived later), further sketches for the A major Quartet, which,\r\nit follows, was the fourth. Among these sketches are others for the\r\nSeptet and the Variations on “Kind, willst du ruhig schlafen?” which\r\nappeared in December in 1799, and was therefore not composed earlier.\r\nAll these sketches date from 1798 and 1799; but the Quartets were not\r\nfinished. In an unused sketch for the Adagio of the quartet in F occur\r\nthe words: “Les derniers soupirs,” which confirm the story told by\r\nAmenda. The continuation of the G major Quartet dates to 1800. Up to\r\nnow no sketches for the Quartet in C minor have been found.\r\n\r\nThe results of this chronological investigation may be summed up as\r\nfollows: The composition of the Quartets was begun in 1798, that in\r\nD, the third, being first undertaken. This was followed by that in F\r\nand soon after, or simultaneously, work was begun on that in G, which\r\nwas originally designed as the second; but, as that in F was completed\r\nearlier, this was designated as the second by Beethoven, and that in\r\nG became in point of time the third. The Quartet in F was finished in\r\nits original shape by June 25, 1799, on which day he gave it to Amenda;\r\nhe revised it later. Whether or not this was also done with the others\r\ncannot be said; there is no evidence. The remark made in 1801, that\r\nhe had just learned to write quartets, need not be read as meaning\r\nthat he had formal instruction from Förster, but is amply explained by\r\nhis practice on the six Quartets; yet Förster may have influenced him\r\nstrongly. He then wrote the one in A (now No. 5), intending it to be\r\nthe fourth; in this he seems to have made use of a _motif_ invented at\r\nan earlier period. The Quartets in B-flat and C minor followed, the\r\nlatter being, perhaps, the last. The definitive elaboration of the\r\nQuartets lasted certainly until 1800, possibly until 1801. The Quartets\r\nthen appeared in two sets from the press of Mollo. It is likely that\r\nthe first three, at least, were in the hands of the publisher before\r\nthe end of 1800, as is proved by the letter to Hoffmeister. The\r\nfirst three appeared in the summer of 1801 and were advertised as on\r\nsale by Nägeli in Zurich already in July; they were mentioned in the\r\n“Allg. Musik. Zeitung” on August 26, and in Spazier’s “Zeitung für die\r\nElegante Welt.” In October of the same year the last three appeared\r\nand Mollo advertised them in the “Wiener Zeitung” of October 28. The\r\nQuartets are dedicated to Prince Lobkowitz.\r\n\r\nNotice of a valuable present to Beethoven from his lenient and generous\r\npatron, Prince Carl Lichnowsky, naturally connects itself with the\r\nstory of the Quartets--a gift thus described by Alois Fuchs, formerly\r\nviolinist in the Imperial Court Orchestra, under date of December 2,\r\n1846:\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN’S QUARTET OF INSTRUMENTS\r\n\r\n     Ludwig van Beethoven owned a complete quartet of excellent\r\n     Italian instruments given to him by his princely patron and\r\n     friend Lichnowsky at the suggestion of the famous quartet-player\r\n     Schuppanzigh. I am in a position to describe each of the\r\n     instruments in detail.\r\n\r\n     1. A violin made by Joseph Guarnerius in Cremona in the year\r\n     1718 is now in the possession of Mr. Karl Holz, director of the\r\n     _Concerts spirituels_ in Vienna.\r\n\r\n     2. The second violin (which was offered for sale) was made by\r\n     Nicholas Amati in the year 1667, and was in the possession of Dr.\r\n     Ohmeyer, who died recently in Hütteldorf; it has been purchased by\r\n     Mr. Huber.\r\n\r\n     3. The viola, made by Vincenzo Ruger in 1690, is also the property\r\n     of Mr. Karl Holz.\r\n\r\n     4. The violoncello, an Andreas Guarnerius of the year 1712, is in\r\n     the possession of Mr. P. Wertheimber of Vienna.\r\n\r\n     The seal of Beethoven has been impressed under the neck of each\r\n     instrument and on the back of each Beethoven scratched a big\r\n     B, probably for the purpose of protecting himself against an\r\n     exchange. The instruments are all well preserved and in good\r\n     condition. The most valuable one, without question, is the violin\r\n     by Joseph Guarnerius, which is distinguished by extraordinary\r\n     power of tone, for which, indeed, Mr. Holz has refused an offer of\r\n     1000 florins.\r\n\r\nThe four instruments were bought by Peter Th. Jokits in 1861, who gave\r\nthem to the Royal Library at Berlin. Beethoven received them from\r\nLichnowsky certainly before 1802, but in what year is unknown.[98]\r\nAnother proof of the Prince’s regard and generosity, however, belongs\r\nto this, namely, an annuity of 600 florins to be continued until the\r\ncomposer should find some suitable permanent employment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe only known publication of the year 1800 is the Rondo in G major,\r\nOp. 51, No. 2, which came from the press of Simrock. As for the\r\ncompositions of the year it is safe to assume that Beethoven put the\r\nfinishing touches to the first Symphony, the Septet, Op. 20, and the\r\nQuartets, Op. 18. Furthermore, there can be little doubt but that the\r\nSonata for Horn, Op. 17, the Pianoforte Sonata, Op. 22, the Concerto in\r\nC minor, and the Variations for Four Hands on the melody of the song\r\n“Ich denke dein,” belong to this year. The “Variations très faciles”\r\non an original theme in G were sketched and probably completed. The\r\nonly chronological clues to the Horn Sonata are the date of its first\r\nperformance, April 18, 1800, and the anecdote by Ries concerning the\r\nrapid completion of the work. No sketches have been found and nothing\r\nis known of the autograph; but according to Nottebohm the beginning\r\nof a clean copy of the Adagio is to be found among the sketches for\r\nthe Sonatas Op. 22 and 23. Punto was still in Munich in 1800, and\r\nsince the work seems assuredly to have been designed for him, there is\r\nequal certainty that it was composed in that year. It was published\r\nby Mollo in March, 1801. The Septet, for four strings and three\r\nwind-instruments, dedicated to the Empress Maria Theresia, was played\r\nat the concert at which the Symphony in C major was brought forward,\r\nApril 2, 1800; but it had been heard previously in the house of Prince\r\nSchwarzenberg. Inasmuch as sketches for it are found among those for\r\nthe Quartets, specially the one in A major, which belong to the year\r\n1799, its inception may be placed in that year, though it was probably\r\nfinished in 1800 shortly before its performance. There is no date on\r\nthe autograph. It was offered to Hoffmeister in the letter of December\r\n15, 1800, and was published by him in 1802. The Septet speedily won\r\ngreat popularity and was frequently transcribed. Hoffmeister had an\r\narrangement for string quintet which he advertised on August 18,\r\n1802. Ries thought that Beethoven had made it, but he was in error;\r\nnevertheless, Beethoven gave Hoffmeister permission to publish an\r\narrangement in which strings were substituted for the wind-instruments,\r\nand himself transcribed it as a pianoforte trio with violin or clarinet\r\n_ad lib_. This arrangement was made as a tribute of gratitude from\r\nthe composer to his new physician, Dr. Johann Schmidt. The doctor\r\nplayed the violin and his daughter the pianoforte, both fairly well,\r\nand Beethoven arranged his popular piece for family use and, as was\r\ncustomary at the time, gave Dr. Schmidt the exclusive possession of the\r\nmusic for a year.[99]\r\n\r\nThe theme of the minuet in the Septet was borrowed from the Pianoforte\r\nSonata, Op. 49, No. 2, but its treatment is original. There has been\r\nconsiderable controversy without absolutely definitive result touching\r\nthe melody which is varied in the Andante. Kretschmer, in his “Deutsche\r\nVolkslieder” (Berlin, 1838; Vol. I, No. 102, p. 181), prints the\r\nmelody in connection with a Rhenish folksong (“Ach Schiffer, lieber\r\nSchiffer”), and there is a tradition that Czerny said that it was taken\r\nby Beethoven from that source. Nottebohm offers evidence deserving of\r\nconsideration that the melody is a folktune; but Ries and Wegeler, who\r\nlived on the Rhine, had nothing to say on the subject. Erk and Böhme\r\n(“Deutscher Liederhort,” Vol. I, p. 273) publish folksongs dealing with\r\nthe legend which is at the base of “Ach Schiffer, lieber Schiffer,”\r\nbut the melody of the Andante is not to be found among them, and Böhme\r\ngives it as his opinion that the song printed by Kretschmer was written\r\nto Beethoven’s melody by Kretschmer’s collaborator Zuccalmaglio. It is\r\nnot likely that the melody, had it lived in the mouths of the people,\r\nwould have escaped so industrious a collector as Erk, who, moreover,\r\nwas a native of the Rhine country. The evidence would seem to indicate\r\nthat the melody was original with Beethoven.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITIONS SKETCHED IN 1800\r\n\r\nThe Pianoforte Sonata in B-flat, Op. 22, also belongs to this year, as\r\nappears from the fact that it was offered to Hoffmeister in the letter\r\nof December 15. It was still in an unfinished state on the completion\r\nof the Sonata for Horn, as is shown by the circumstance that sketches\r\nof it are mingled with a fair transcript of a passage from the latter\r\nwork. There are also sketches for Op. 22, among those for the Quartet\r\nin B-flat, Op. 18, No. 6, and the later movements of the Quartet in\r\nF--no doubt the revision. The sketches therefore belong to the year\r\n1800, but may date back to 1799, from which it would appear that\r\nBeethoven worked an unusually long time on the Sonata. The principal\r\nlabor was performed most likely in the summer of 1800, which Beethoven\r\nspent at Unterdöbling. It was published in 1802 by Hoffmeister and\r\nKühnel. Sketches from the “Six Easy Variations” are found amongst\r\nsome for the last movement of the Quartet in G, which seem to be\r\nnearly finished. Again we can fix the year as 1799 or 1800. Of special\r\nimportance is the fact that the theme of the Variations is the same\r\nas the first episode of the rondo of the Sonata in B-flat, and the\r\ncircumstance that the sketches are of almost the same date indicates\r\nthat the identity was not accidental. The Variations were advertised as\r\nnew by Traeg on December 16, 1800.\r\n\r\nThe Variations in D for four hands on the melody of Goethe’s poem, “Ich\r\ndenke dein,” were conceived at practically the same time as those just\r\ndescribed. Beethoven at first intended to give each stanza a separate\r\nsetting, and to this end made two sketches, which are associated with\r\nthe Quartet sketches and belong to the year 1799. He then took the\r\nmelody of the first stanza as a theme for variations for four hands in\r\nthe same year and wrote them into the autograph album of two sisters,\r\nthe countesses Therese Brunswick and Josephine Deym. On September\r\n22, 1803, he offered them to Hoffmeister in the place of the Trio\r\nVariations, Op. 44, with the remark that he considered them better\r\nthan the latter. Hoffmeister, however, published the Trio Variations\r\n(in 1804). The Variations in D were not published until the beginning\r\nof 1805, and were described as having been written in 1800 for the two\r\ncountesses mentioned, and dedicated to them.\r\n\r\nAn autograph preserved in the Royal Library in Berlin contains four\r\nof the variations on “Ich denke dein,” an Adagio in F major noted on\r\nfour staves (three with treble, one with the bass clef), a Scherzo in\r\nG major, 3/4 time, and an Allegro in G major, 2/4. Albert Kopfermann,\r\nwho published the Adagio for the first time in No. 12, Vol. I, of “Die\r\nMusik,” considers, no doubt correctly, that the three compositions were\r\nwritten for an automatic musical instrument. Though the number of new\r\ncompositions produced in 1800 was small, attention must be directed to\r\nthe fact that the revision and completion of works for publication,\r\ntogether with the planning of new works, gave a deal of occupation to\r\nBeethoven. Amongst the compositions made ready for the printer were the\r\nQuartets, which were not ready till near the end of the year. To them\r\nmust be added the Sonata in E-flat, Op. 27, No. 1, and the Concerto in\r\nC minor, the autograph of which distinctly bears the date 1800. It is\r\ncertain, moreover, that Beethoven began working on “Prometheus” in this\r\nyear, and the summer must have been a busy one for him.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[91] “He could not endure his Septet and grew angry because of the\r\nuniversal applause with which it was received.” (Czerny to Jahn.) “The\r\ntheme of the variations is said to be a Rhenish folksong.” (_Ibid._)\r\n\r\n[92] This is, of course, an error, as the Trio had been before the\r\npublic since October 3rd, 1798.\r\n\r\n[93] From Weigl’s “Corsair aus Liebe.”\r\n\r\n[94] According to Frimmel, “Beethoven’s Wohnungen,” Vienna “Neue Freie\r\nPresse,” August 11, 1899, this house was that of Court Councillor\r\nGreiner, then No. 241, afterwards 235, now No. 10 in the Tiefen Graben\r\nwhich, slightly altered, still remains. On the strength of Czerny’s\r\nstatement that one had to look up to the fifth or sixth storey to see\r\nBeethoven, and the old report that Beethoven lived “in the Kleine\r\nWeintraube,” Frimmel was led to think that possibly he lived in one of\r\nthe houses on the higher ground behind the Greiner house to which there\r\nwas access from the open place “Am Hof” as well as from the houses in\r\nthe Tiefen Graben and the Greiner house. The houses which bore the sign\r\n“Zur Weintraube” were situated “am Hofe.”\r\n\r\n[95] In B-flat, Op. 22.\r\n\r\n[96] The Pianoforte Concerto offered to Hoffmeister was that in B-flat.\r\nIt was published by Hoffmeister and Kühnel toward the end of 1801\r\nand advertised on January 16, 1802. The Concerto published by Mollo\r\nwas that in C major. A letter written to Breitkopf and Härtel on the\r\nsame day contains the equivalent of the remark: “I am for the present\r\nkeeping the better ones for myself until I make a tour,” which is\r\nsignificant, since it makes it sure that other concertos were at least\r\nplanned and that the one in C minor was looked upon as finished by\r\nBeethoven.\r\n\r\n[97] In reality it was the second, as the Amenda parts show.\r\n\r\n[98] Holz sold the Guarnerius violin in 1852 (see the “Allgemeine\r\nDeutsche Musikzeitung” of 1888). When the Beethoven Museum in Bonn was\r\ndedicated, the instruments were borrowed from the authorities of the\r\nRoyal Library, and exhibited in a glass case, where they remain by\r\nsufferance of the Prussian authorities.\r\n\r\n[99] See the dedication in Kalischer’s collection of Beethoven’s\r\nletters translated by J. S. Shedlock, Vol. I, p. 94.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIX\r\n\r\n     The Year 1801--Concerts for Wounded Soldiers--Vigano and the\r\n     Ballet “Prometheus”--Stephan von Breuning--Hetzendorf--“Christus\r\n     am Ölberg”--Compositions and Publications of the Year--The Funeral\r\n     March in the Sonata, Op. 26--The “Moonlight” Sonata--The Quintet,\r\n     Op. 29.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tone of Beethoven’s correspondence and the many proofs of his\r\nuntiring industry during the winter 1800-1 and early part of the\r\nsucceeding spring, suggest a mind at ease, rejoicing in the exercise\r\nof its powers, and a body glowing with vigorous health. But for his\r\nown words to Wegeler: “I have been really miserable this winter,” the\r\npassing allusions to ill health in his replies to Hoffmeister’s letters\r\nwould merely impress the reader as being half-groundless apologies for\r\nlack of punctuality in writing. This chapter will exhibit the young\r\nmaster both as he appeared to the public and as he showed himself in\r\nconfidential intercourse to the few in whose presence he put aside the\r\nmask and laid open his heart; and will, therefore, it is believed, be\r\nfound fully to justify what has been said of his heroic energy, courage\r\nand endurance under a trouble of no ordinary nature.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the year he wrote to Hoffmeister[100] as follows\r\nunder date “January 15 (or thereabouts), 1801”:\r\n\r\n     ... Your enterprises delight me also and I wish that if works of\r\n     art ever bring profit that it might go to real artists instead of\r\n     mere shopkeepers.\r\n\r\n     The fact that you purpose to publish the works of _Sebastian\r\n     Bach_ does good to my heart which beats only for the lofty and\r\n     magnificent art of this patriarch of harmony, and I hope soon to\r\n     see them in vigorous sale. I hope, as soon as golden peace has\r\n     been declared, to be helpful in many ways, especially if you offer\r\n     the works for subscription.\r\n\r\n     As regards our real business, since you ask it I meet your wishes\r\n     by offering you the following items: Septet (concerning which I\r\n     have already written you), 20 ducats; Symphony, 20 ducats; Grand\r\n     Solo Sonata--Allegro, Adagio, Minuetto, Rondo--20 ducats. This\r\n     Sonata is a tidy piece of work (_hat sich gewaschen_), my dearest\r\n     Mr. Brother.\r\n\r\n     Now for an explanation: You will wonder, perhaps, that I have\r\n     made no distinction here between Sonata, Septet and Symphony. I\r\n     have done this because I have learned that a septet or symphony\r\n     has a smaller sale than a sonata, though a symphony ought\r\n     unquestionably to be worth more. (N. B. The Septet consists of a\r\n     short introductory _Adagio_, then _Allegro_, _Adagio_, _Minuetto_,\r\n     _Andante_ with variations, _Minuetto_ again, a short _Adagio_\r\n     introduction and then _Presto_.) I put the price of the Concerto\r\n     at only 10 ducats because, as I have already written, I do not\r\n     give it out as one of my best. I do not think the amount excessive\r\n     on the whole; I have tried, at least, to make the price as\r\n     moderate as possible for you. As regards the bill of exchange you\r\n     may, since you leave the matter to me, issue it to Geimüller or\r\n     Schüller. The whole sum amounts to 70 ducats for the four works.\r\n     I do not understand any money except Viennese ducats; how many\r\n     thalers in gold that amounts to does not concern me, I being a\r\n     really bad negotiator and mathematician.\r\n\r\n     This disposes of the disagreeable (_saure_) business; I call it so\r\n     because I wish things were different in the world. There ought to\r\n     be only one art warehouse in the world to which an artist would\r\n     only need to carry his art-works to take away with him whatever\r\n     he needed; as it is one must be half tradesman; and how we adjust\r\n     ourselves--good God!--that is what I again call disagreeable. As\r\n     regards the L... O...,[101] let them talk; they will certainly\r\n     never make anybody immortal by their twaddle, and as little will\r\n     they rob anybody of immortality to whom Apollo has decreed it.\r\n\r\nBENEFIT CONCERTS FOR WOUNDED SOLDIERS\r\n\r\nThe next letter requires a word of introduction. That military campaign\r\nwhich included the disastrous field of Hohenlinden (December 3, 1800),\r\nhad filled the hospitals at Vienna, and among the various means of\r\nraising funds for the benefit of the wounded, was a series of public\r\nconcerts. The two in which they reached their climax took place in\r\nthe large Ridotto room (_Redouten-Saal_) of the imperial palace. The\r\none arranged by Baron von Braun as Director of the Court Opera, was a\r\nperformance of Haydn’s “Creation” conducted by the composer, on January\r\n16th; the other was arranged by Mme. Frank (Christine Gerhardi) for\r\nJanuary 30th. That lady, Mme. Galvani (Magdalena Willmann) and Herr\r\nSimoni were the singers, Beethoven and Punto the instrumental solo\r\nperformers; Haydn directed two of his own symphonies, Paër and Conti\r\ndirected the orchestra in the accompaniments to the vocal music. In\r\nthe first public announcement printed in the “Wiener Zeitung” the only\r\nartist mentioned was “the famous amateur singer Frau von Frank, _née_\r\nGerhardi,” as the giver of the concert. This called out from Beethoven\r\nthe following letter:\r\n\r\n    Pour Madame de Frank.\r\n\r\n     I think it my duty, best of women, to ask you not to permit your\r\n     husband again in the second announcement of our concert to forget\r\n     that those who contribute their talents to the same also be made\r\n     known to the public. This is the custom, and I do not see if it\r\n     is not done what is to increase the attendance at the concert,\r\n     which is its chief aim. Punto is not a little wrought up about the\r\n     matter, and he is right, and it was my intention even before I saw\r\n     him to remind you of what must have been the result of great haste\r\n     or great forgetfulness. Look after this, best of women, since if\r\n     it is not done dissatisfaction will surely result.\r\n\r\n     Having been convinced, not only by myself but by others as well,\r\n     that I am not a useless factor in this concert, I know that not\r\n     only I but Punto, Simoni, Galvani will ask that the public be\r\n     informed also of our zeal for the philanthropic purposes of this\r\n     concert; otherwise we must all conclude that we are useless.\r\n\r\n    Wholly yours\r\n\r\n    L. v. Bthvn.\r\n\r\nWhether this sharp remonstrance produced the desired effect cannot now\r\nbe ascertained, but the original advertisement was repeated in the\r\nnewspaper on the 24th and 28th _verbatim_.\r\n\r\nIn the state of affairs then existing it was no time to give public\r\nconcerts for private emolument; moreover, a quarrel with the orchestra\r\na year before might have prevented Beethoven from obtaining the\r\nBurgtheater again, and the new Theater-an-der-Wien was not yet ready\r\nfor occupation; but there is still another adequate reason for his\r\ngiving no _Akademie_ (concert) this spring. He had been engaged to\r\ncompose an important work for the court stage.\r\n\r\nVIGANO AND THE PROMETHEUS BALLET\r\n\r\nSalvatore Vigano, dancer and composer of ballets, both action and\r\nmusic, the son of a Milanese of the same profession, was born at\r\nNaples, March 29, 1769. He began his career at Rome, taking female\r\nparts because women were not allowed there to appear upon the stage.\r\nHe then had engagements successively at Madrid--where he married\r\nMaria Medina, a celebrated Spanish danseuse--Bordeaux, London and\r\nVenice, in which last city, in 1791, he composed his “Raoul, Sire\r\nde Croqui.” Thence he came to Vienna, where he and his wife first\r\nappeared in May, 1793. His “Raoul” was produced on June 25th at the\r\nKärnthnerthor-Theater. After two years of service here he accepted\r\nengagements in five continental cities and returned to Vienna again in\r\n1799. The second wife of Emperor Franz, Maria Theresia, was a woman\r\nof much and true musical taste and culture, and Vigano determined to\r\ncompliment her in a ballet composed expressly for that purpose. Haydn’s\r\ngloriously successful “Creation” may, perhaps, have had an influence in\r\nthe choice of a subject, “The Men of Prometheus,” and the dedication of\r\nBeethoven’s Septet to the Empress may have had its effect in the choice\r\nof a composer. At all events, the work was entrusted to Beethoven.\r\n\r\nIf the manner in which this work has been neglected by Beethoven’s\r\nbiographers and critics may be taken as a criterion, an opinion\r\nprevails that it was not worthy of him in subject, execution or\r\nsuccess. It seems to be forgotten that as an orchestral composer he\r\nwas then known only by two or three pianoforte concertos and his first\r\nSymphony--a work which by no means rivals the greater production of\r\nMozart and Haydn--and that for the stage he was not known to have\r\nwritten anything. There is a misconception, too, as to the position\r\nwhich the ballet just then held in the Court Theatre. As a matter of\r\nfact it stood higher than ever before and, perhaps, than it has ever\r\nstood since. Vigano was a man of real genius and had wrought a reform\r\nwhich is clearly, vigorously and compendiously described in a memoir of\r\nHeinrich von Collin, from which we quote:\r\n\r\n     In the reign of Leopold II the ballet, which had become a\r\n     well-attended entertainment in Vienna through the efforts of\r\n     Noverre, was restored to the stage. Popular interest turned at\r\n     once to them again, and this was intensified in a great degree\r\n     when, beside the ballet-master Muzarelli, a second ballet-master,\r\n     Mr. Salvatore Vigano, whose wife disclosed to the eyes of the\r\n     spectators a thitherto unsuspected art, also gave entertainments.\r\n     The most important affairs of state are scarcely able to create\r\n     a greater war of feeling than was brought about at the time by\r\n     the rivalry of the two ballet-masters. Theatre-lovers without\r\n     exception divided themselves into two parties who looked upon\r\n     each other with hatred and contempt because of a difference of\r\n     conviction.... The new ballet-master owed his extraordinary\r\n     triumph over his older rival to his restoration of his art back\r\n     from the exaggerated, inexpressive artificialities of the old\r\n     Italian ballet to the simple forms of nature. Of course, there\r\n     was something startling in seeing a form of drama with which\r\n     thitherto there had been associated only leaps, contortions,\r\n     constrained positions, and complicated dances which left behind\r\n     them no feeling of unity, suddenly succeeded by dramatic action,\r\n     depth of feeling, and plastic beauty of representation as they\r\n     were so magnificently developed in the earlier ballets of Mr.\r\n     Salvatore Vigano, opening, as they did, a new realm of beauty. And\r\n     though it may be true that it was especially the natural, joyous,\r\n     unconstrained dancing of Madame Vigano and her play of features,\r\n     as expressive as it was fascinating, which provoked the applause\r\n     of the many, it is nevertheless true that the very subject-matter\r\n     of the ballets, which differentiate themselves very favorably\r\n     from his later conceits, and his then wholly classical, skilful\r\n     and manly dancing, were well calculated to inspire admiration and\r\n     respect for the master and his creations.\r\n\r\nTwo or three pages might be compiled of spicy matter upon the beautiful\r\nMme. Vigano’s lavish display of the Venus-like graces and charms of\r\nher exquisite form; but her name, long before the “Prometheus” ballet,\r\nhad disappeared from the roll of the theatre and Fräulein Cassentini\r\nreigned in her stead. There was nothing derogatory to Beethoven in\r\nhis acceptance of the commission to compose the music to a ballet by\r\nVigano; but by whom commissioned, upon what terms, and when--concerning\r\nthese and similar particulars, we know nothing. We only know, that\r\nat the close of the season before Easter, on the 28th of March,\r\n“Die Geschöpfe des Prometheus” was performed for the first time for\r\nthe benefit of the prima ballerina of the ballet corps, Fräulein\r\nCassentini, and that the whole number of its performances this year\r\nwas sixteen, and in 1802 thirteen. The pecuniary result to Beethoven\r\nmust therefore have been satisfactory. True, the full score did not\r\nappear in print in Beethoven’s lifetime or for a long time thereafter;\r\nit was not published, indeed, until the appearance of the critical\r\nComplete Edition, in which it figures as No. 11 of Series II; nothing\r\nis known of the original manuscript. A copy revised except as to two\r\nnumbers, is in the Royal Imperial Court Library at Vienna. A pianoforte\r\narrangement of the score was published in June, 1801, by Artaria with\r\nthe opus number 24 and a dedication to Prince Lichnowsky. Hoffmeister\r\nprinted the orchestral parts and a pianoforte score in 1804 as Op. 43\r\n(the number 24 having meanwhile been assigned to the Violin Sonata in\r\nF). Mention ought, perhaps, also to be made of a pianoforte arrangement\r\nof No. 8 for four hands “composé pour la famille Kobler par Louis van\r\nBeethoven. Cette pièce se trouve aussi à gr. Orchestre dans le même\r\nMagazin.” The Kobler family was frequently in Vienna, among other times\r\nin 1814; it had nothing to do with the “Prometheus” music.\r\n\r\nAlois Fuchs has preserved a characteristic anecdote which came to him\r\n“from the worthy hand of a contemporary”:\r\n\r\n     When Beethoven had composed the music to the ballet “Die Geschöpfe\r\n     des Prometheus” in 1801, he was one day met by his former teacher,\r\n     the great Joseph Haydn, who stopped him at once and said: “Well,\r\n     I heard your ballet yesterday and it pleased me very much!”\r\n     Beethoven replied: “O, dear Papa, you are very kind; but it is\r\n     far from being a ‘Creation!’” Haydn, surprised at the answer and\r\n     almost offended, said after a short pause: “That is true; it is\r\n     not yet a ‘Creation’ and I can scarcely believe that it will ever\r\n     become one.” Whereupon the men said their adieus, both somewhat\r\n     embarrassed.\r\n\r\nFrom the period immediately following we have another letter from\r\nBeethoven to Hoffmeister, dated April 22, 1801, in which he says:\r\n\r\n     Perhaps, too, it is the only sign of genius about me that my\r\n     things are not always in the best of order, and nobody can mend\r\n     the matter except myself. Thus, for instance, the pianoforte part,\r\n     as is usual with me, was not written out in score and I only now\r\n     have made a fair copy of it so that because of your haste you\r\n     might not receive my too illegible manuscript. So that the works\r\n     may appear in the proper sequence as far as possible I inform\r\n     you that the following opus numbers ought to be placed on the\r\n     compositions:\r\n\r\n    On the Solo Sonata      Opus 22\r\n    On the Symphony           „  21\r\n    On the Septet             „  20\r\n    On the Concerto           „  19\r\n\r\n     The titles I will send you soon.\r\n\r\n     Set me down as a subscriber for the works of Johann Sebastian\r\n     Bach, also Prince Lichnowsky. The transcription of the Mozart\r\n     sonata (or sonatas) as quartets and quintets will do you honor\r\n     and certainly prove remunerative. In this also I should like to\r\n     be of greater service, but I am a disorderly individual and with\r\n     the best of intentions I am continually forgetting everything;\r\n     yet I have spoken about the matter here and there, and everywhere\r\n     have found inclination towards it. It would be a handsome thing\r\n     if Mr. Brother besides doing this were to publish an arrangement\r\n     of the Septet for flute, as quintet, for example; by this means\r\n     the amateur flautists, who have already approached me on the\r\n     subject, would be helped and they would swarm around it like\r\n     hungry insects. To say something about myself, I have just written\r\n     a ballet in which the ballet-master did not do as well as he\r\n     might have done. Baron von Liechtenstein has endowed us with a\r\n     product not commensurate with the ideas which the newspapers\r\n     have spread touching his genius; another bit of evidence against\r\n     the newspapers. The Baron seems to have formed his ideal on Herr\r\n     Müller in the marionette show, without, however, having attained\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     These are the beautiful prospects under which we poor fellows in\r\n     Vienna are expected to flourish....\r\n\r\nUnder the same date Beethoven wrote to Breitkopf and Härtel:\r\n\r\nADVICE TO THE CRITICS OF LEIPSIC\r\n\r\n     ... As regards your request for compositions by me I regret that\r\n     at this time I am unable to oblige you; but please tell me what\r\n     kind of compositions of mine you want, viz., symphonies, quartets,\r\n     sonatas, etc., so that I may govern myself accordingly, and in\r\n     case I have what you need or want I may place it at your service.\r\n     If I am right, 8 works of mine are about to appear at Mollo’s\r\n     in this place; four pieces at Hofmeister’s in Leipsic; in this\r\n     connection I wish to add that _one of my first concertos[102]\r\n     and therefore not one of_ the best of my compositions, is to be\r\n     published by Hofmeister, and that Mollo is to publish a Concerto\r\n     which, indeed, was written later[103] _but nevertheless does not\r\n     rank among the best of my works in this form_. This is only a\r\n     hint for your musical journal in the matter of criticism of these\r\n     works, although if one might hear them (well-played, that is), one\r\n     would best be able to judge them. Musical policy requires that\r\n     one should keep possession for a space of the best concertos.\r\n     You should recommend to Messrs. your critics great care and\r\n     wisdom especially in the case of the products of younger authors;\r\n     many a one may be frightened off who otherwise might, probably,\r\n     accomplish more; so far as I am concerned I am far from thinking\r\n     that I am so perfect as not to be subject to blame, yet the howls\r\n     of your critics against me were at first so humiliating that after\r\n     comparing myself with others I could not get angry, but remained\r\n     perfectly quiet, and concluded they did not understand their\r\n     business; it was the easier to remain quiet since I saw the praise\r\n     lavished on people who have no significance in loco in the eyes\r\n     of the better sort, and who disappeared from sight here no matter\r\n     how good they may otherwise have been--but _pax vobiscum_--peace\r\n     for me and them--I would not have mentioned a syllable about the\r\n     matter had not you yourself done so.\r\n\r\n     Coming recently to a friend who showed me the amount which had\r\n     been collected _for the daughter of the immortal god of harmony_,\r\n     I marvel at the smallness of the sum which Germany, especially\r\n     _your Germany_, had contributed in recognition of the individual\r\n     who seems to me worthy of respect for her father’s sake, which\r\n     brings me to the thought how would it do if I were to publish a\r\n     work for the benefit of this person by subscription, acquaint the\r\n     public each year with the amount and its proceeds in order to\r\n     assure her against possible misfortune. Write me quickly how this\r\n     might best be accomplished so that something may be done before\r\n     _this Bach_ dies, before this brook[104] dries up and we be no\r\n     longer able to supply it with water. That you would publish the\r\n     work is self-evident.\r\n\r\nPoor Maximilian’s health having become precarious, the welfare of the\r\nTeutonic Order in those revolutionary times demanded that a wise and\r\nenergetic successor to him as Grand Master should be secured in the\r\nperson of an efficient coadjutor. The thoughts of all parties concerned\r\nfixed upon a man who was then not even a member of the order, in case\r\nhe would join it and accept the position, namely, the famous Archduke\r\nKarl. A Grand Chapter was therefore called at Vienna, which opened June\r\n1st, and which unanimously admitted him to membership, he receiving a\r\ndispensation from taking the oaths for the time being. On June 3rd,\r\nhe was elected coadjutor and on the 11th he received the accolade. The\r\ncircular which called the meeting brought to the Austrian capital the\r\nwhole body of officials employed at Mergentheim, and thus it happened\r\nthat Stephan von Breuning, whose name appears in the Calendar of the\r\norder from 1797 to 1803, inclusive, as Hofrathsassessor, came again\r\nto Vienna and renewed intimate personal intercourse with Beethoven.\r\nAnother of our old Bonn acquaintances had also recently come thither,\r\nhe of whom (in the opinion of the present writer) Beethoven writes\r\nto Amenda: “Now to my comfort a man has come again”--namely, Anton\r\nReicha. In the spring of this year Beethoven removed from the Tiefer\r\nGraben into rooms overlooking one of the bastions--there is little if\r\nany doubt, the Wasserkunstbastei--and in one of those houses the main\r\nentrances to which are in the Sailerstätte. At a later period of his\r\nlife he came thither again, and with good reason; for those houses not\r\nonly afforded a beautiful view over the Glacis and the Landsstrasse\r\nsuburb, but plenty of sun and fresh air. In the Hamberger house, where\r\nnow stands No. 15, he had often gone with his exercises to Joseph\r\nHaydn, and hard by lived his friend Anton von Türkheim, Royal Imperial\r\nTruchsess--that is, carver.\r\n\r\nThis year he chose Hetzendorf for his summer retreat. Those who know\r\nwell the environs of Vienna, are aware that this village offers less\r\nattraction to the lover of nature than a hundred others within easy\r\ndistance of the city. There is nothing to invite one, who is fond of\r\nthe solitude of the forest, but the thick groves in the garden of\r\nSchönbrunn some ten minutes’ walk distant. It is certainly possible\r\nthat Beethoven’s state of health may have forbidden him to indulge his\r\ntaste for long rambles, and that the cool shades of Schönbrunn, so\r\neasily and at all times accessible, may have determined his choice. It\r\nwould be pleasant to believe, though there is no evidence to support\r\nsuch a belief, that some feeling of regard for his former patron\r\nMaximilian, who had sought retirement at Hetzendorf, was one of the\r\ncauses which induced the composer to spend this summer there.\r\n\r\nORATORIO: “THE MOUNT OF OLIVES”\r\n\r\nThat was a period at Vienna fruitful in short sacred cantatas. On\r\ncertain days in the spring and late autumn no theatrical performances\r\nwere allowed and the principal composers embraced the opportunity\r\nto exhibit their skill and invention in this branch of their art;\r\nsometimes in concerts for their own benefit, more commonly in those for\r\npublic charities. Haydn, Salieri, Winter, Süssmayr, Paër, are names\r\nthat will occur in this connection to every student of Vienna’s musical\r\nannals. Beethoven, ever ready to compete with the greatest talent\r\nin at least one work, and desirous of producing at his next concert\r\nthe novelty of an extensive vocal composition by himself, determined\r\nto compose a work of this class. The subject chosen was “Christus am\r\nÖlberg.”[105] Its composition was the grand labor of this summer. “The\r\ntext was written by me in collaboration with the poet within 14 days,”\r\nwrites Beethoven in one of his letters, “but the poet was musical and\r\nhad already written many things for music; I was able to consult with\r\nhim at any moment.” This poet was Franz Xaver Huber, fertile writer\r\nin general literature and a popular author for the Vienna stage,\r\nwho occupied so high a place in public esteem, that his consent to\r\nprepare the text of the “Christus” is another indication of the high\r\nreputation of Beethoven. The merits and demerits of the poem need not\r\nbe expatiated upon; Beethoven’s own words show that he was in part\r\nresponsible for them. Schindler says:\r\n\r\n     Beethoven also lived in Hetzendorf in 1805 and composed his\r\n     “Fidelio.” A coincidence touching the two works, one that\r\n     remained in the lively memory of Beethoven for many years, was\r\n     that he composed both of them in the thicket of the forest in\r\n     the Schönbrunner Hofgarten, sitting on the hill between two oaks\r\n     which branched out from the trunk about two feet from the ground.\r\n     This oak, which always remained remarkable in his eyes (it is to\r\n     the left of the Gloriet), I found again with Beethoven as late as\r\n     1823, and it awakened in him interesting memories of the early\r\n     period.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo far as has been determined, the compositions completed in 1801 were\r\nthe Sonatas for Pianoforte and Violin, Op. 23 and 24; the Pianoforte\r\nSonatas in A-flat, Op. 26, E-flat, Op. 27, No. 1, and C-sharp minor,\r\nOp. 27, No. 2, and D major, Op. 28; and the Quintet in C major, Op. 29.\r\n“The Andante in D minor of the Sonata, Op. 28,” says Czerny, “was long\r\nhis favorite and he played it often for his own pleasure.” The twelve\r\nContradances and six Rustic Dances (_Ländler_) are sketched in part\r\non the first staves of the Kessler sketchbook. If we are justified in\r\nassuming that they were composed for the balls of the succeeding winter\r\nand were played from manuscript, it would follow that they also are to\r\nbe counted among the compositions completed in this year.\r\n\r\nPUBLICATIONS OF THE YEAR 1801\r\n\r\nThe published works were the Concerto for Pianoforte and Orchestra,\r\nOp. 15, dedicated “À son Altesse Madame la Princesse Odescalchi née\r\nKeglevics”; the Sonata for Pianoforte and Horn, Op. 17, dedicated\r\n“À Madame la Baronne de Braun”; the Quintet for Pianoforte, Oboe,\r\nClarinet, Horn and Bassoon, Op. 16, dedicated “À son Altesse\r\nMonseigneur le Prince Régnant de Schwarzenberg.” These three works\r\nwere announced by Mollo and Co. on March 21. Furthermore, the music\r\nto “Prometheus,” arranged for Pianoforte (according to Czerny by\r\nthe composer) and dedicated “A sua Altezza la Signora Principessa\r\nLichnowsky, nata Contessa Thun,” published in June by Artaria as Op.\r\n27; “6 Variations très faciles” on an original theme in G, announced by\r\nJohann Traeg as absolutely new on August 11, sketched in the preceding\r\nyear but probably completed in this; the Sonatas, Op. 23 and 24,\r\ndedicated “À Monsieur le Comte Maurice de Fries,” announced on October\r\n28; the six Quartets, Op. 18, dedicated “À son Altesse Monseigneur le\r\nPrince Régnant de Lobkowitz,” announced (second series) on October\r\n28 by Mollo. The Pianoforte Concerto in B-flat, Op. 19, dedicated “À\r\nMonsieur Charles Nikl Noble de Nikelsberg,” and the Symphony in C,\r\nOp. 21, dedicated “À son Excellence Monsieur le Baron van Swieten,”\r\nwere published by Hoffmeister and Kühnel of Leipsic certainly before\r\nthe end of the year, since they reached Vienna on January 16, and\r\nwere advertised there. An earlier Leipsic edition has not been found.\r\nThe two Violin Sonatas in A minor and F major were dedicated to Count\r\nMoritz von Fries and were originally intended to be coupled in a\r\nsingle opus number (23), as appears from the preliminary announcement\r\nby Mollo in the “Wiener Zeitung” of October 28, 1801, and also by the\r\ndesignation of the second as “No. 2,” on a copy of Op 24. Sketches\r\nof the two found in the Petters sketchbook are evidence of their\r\nsimultaneous origin.\r\n\r\nThe Pianoforte Sonata, Op. 26, had its origin, according to Nottebohm’s\r\nstudy of the sketches, in the year 1800; but Shedlock (in the “Musical\r\nTimes” of August, 1892) prints a few beginnings of the first movement\r\nin B minor (!) which probably date farther back, perhaps to the Bonn\r\nperiod. A young composer,[106] Ferdinand Paër (born at Parma in 1771),\r\nsince the beginning of 1798 had produced on the court stage a series of\r\npleasing and popular works. Laboring in a sphere so totally different\r\nfrom that of Beethoven, there was no rivalry between them and their\r\nrelations were cordial and friendly. On June 6th of this summer Paër\r\nbrought out a heroic opera, “Achilles,” which “was received with a\r\nstorm of approval and deserved it,” says the correspondent of the\r\n“Zeitung für die Elegante Welt.” Paër in his old age told Ferdinand\r\nHiller a characteristic anecdote of Beethoven which cannot possibly be\r\ntrue in connection with his “Leonore,” as he, by a lapse of memory,\r\nrelated it, but is, undoubtedly, in connection with “Achilles.” It was\r\nto the effect that Beethoven went with Paër to the theatre where an\r\nopera by the latter was performing. He sat beside him and after he had\r\ntime and again cried out, “Ah, que c’est beau, que c’est intéressant!”\r\nhad finally said: “Il faut que je compose cela.” The correspondent just\r\ncited complains of the “want of character” in the marches in “Achilles”\r\nand incidentally confirms one of Ries’s “Notizen”: “The funeral march\r\nin A-flat minor in the Sonata dedicated to Prince Lichnowsky (Op.\r\n26) was the result of the great praise with which the funeral march\r\nin Paër’s ‘Achilles’ was received by Beethoven’s friends.” Of that\r\nSonata, completed this year, Czerny says: “When Cramer was in Vienna\r\nand was creating a great sensation not only by his playing but also by\r\nthe three sonatas which he dedicated to Haydn (of which the first in\r\nA-flat, 3/4 time, awakened great amazement), Beethoven, who had been\r\npitted against Cramer, wrote the A-flat Sonata, Op. 26, in which there\r\nis purposely a reminder of the Clementi-Cramer passage-work in the\r\nFinale. The _Marcia funebre_ was composed on the impulsion of a very\r\nmuch admired funeral march of Paër’s, and added to the Sonata.”\r\n\r\nWhether or not this funeral march was really occasioned by Paër’s\r\n“Achilles” or one from another opera by Paër (since “Achilles” was\r\nperformed for the first time in 1801, and the older first sketches\r\nalready contemplated a “pezzo caracteristico p. e. una marcia in as\r\nmoll”), is of subordinate interest, since the legend has nothing\r\nwhatever to do with reminiscences, but only with its tremendous\r\nsuperiority to the music by Paër.\r\n\r\n     The enigmatic “Sonata pour M.” in the sketches for this sonata no\r\n     doubt means “for Mollo” simply. The splendid print in _facsimile_,\r\n     published by Erich Praeger from the autograph discovered by him,\r\n     gives information concerning the sketches and also concerning the\r\n     legends which refer to the origin of the different movements.\r\n\r\nTHE C-SHARP MINOR SONATA\r\n\r\nOf the two Pianoforte Sonatas, Op. 27, the first (in E-flat) was\r\ndedicated to the Princess Johanna von Liechtenstein, _née_ the\r\nLandgravine Fürstenberg, the second to Countess Giulietta Guicciardi.\r\nIt is apparent, therefore, that they appeared separately at first.\r\nSketches of the first show that they originated in 1801. Both are\r\ndesignated “quasi fantasia,” which plainly indicates a departure from\r\nthe customary structure. The C-sharp minor Sonata, Op. 27, No. 2,\r\nwas dedicated to the Countess Giulietta Guicciardi, who at this time\r\n(1801-1802) was Beethoven’s pupil and indubitably must be counted\r\namongst the ladies who, for a time at least, were near to his heart.\r\nConcerning this, later. As his relationship to the Countess has been\r\nexaggerated, so also more significance has been attached to this sonata\r\nthan is justified from a sober point of view. Beethoven himself was\r\nvexed that more importance was attached to it than to other sonatas\r\nwhich he held in higher esteem (Op. 78, for instance), simply because\r\nit had become popular. Its popularity was subsequently heightened by\r\nthe designations “Arbor Sonata” and “Moonlight Sonata” and its creation\r\ninto a sort of love-song without words, especially after Schindler had\r\nidentified the Countess Guicciardi with the “Immortal Beloved” of the\r\nfamous love-letter. It was a long time before attention was paid to a\r\nletter written by Dr. G. L. Grosheim, to Beethoven, dated November 10,\r\n1819, in which occur the words: “You wrote me that at Seume’s grave (in\r\nTeplitz) you had placed yourself among his admirers.... It is a desire\r\nwhich I cannot suppress, that you, Mr. Chapelmaster, would give to the\r\nworld your wedding with Seume--I mean your Fantasia in C-sharp minor\r\nand the ‘Beterin’.”[107]\r\n\r\nThe autograph of the Sonata in D, Op. 28, bears the inscription “Gran\r\nSonata, Op. 28, 1801, da L. van Beethoven.” It appeared in print in\r\n1802, having been advertised in the “Wiener Zeitung” of August 14, from\r\nthe Industriekontor, with the dedication, “À Monsieur Joseph Noble de\r\nSonnenfels, Conseiller aulique et Sécrétaire perpétuel de l’Académie\r\ndes Beaux Arts.” Touching the personality of Joseph Noble de Sonnenfels\r\nsomething may be learned from W. Nagel’s book, “Beethoven und seine\r\nKlaviersonaten,” and also from Willibald Müller’s biography of him.\r\nAt the time, Sonnenfels was nearly 70 years old and, so far as is\r\nknown, was not an intimate friend of Beethoven’s; the dedication was\r\nprobably nothing more than a mark of respect for the man of brains\r\nwith whose ideas Beethoven was in sympathy. The single clue as to the\r\norigin of the work is the date (1801) on the autograph; sketches seem\r\nto be lacking. The sunny disposition of the music is the only evidence,\r\nand this is internal. The work early acquired the sobriquet “Sonata\r\npastorale” (it was first printed by A. Cranz), and the designation is\r\nnot inept.\r\n\r\nTHE STRING QUINTET IN C, OP. 29\r\n\r\nThe String Quintet, Op. 29, as is evidenced by an inscription on the\r\nscore, was composed in 1801 and published by Breitkopf and Härtel in\r\n1802, towards the close of the year. Simultaneously it appeared from\r\nthe press of Artaria. This second edition has a history. According to\r\nRies the Quintet\r\n\r\n     was stolen in Vienna and published by A. (Artaria) and Co.\r\n     Having been copied in a single night, it was full of errors....\r\n     Beethoven’s conduct in the matter is without parallel. He asked\r\n     A. to send the fifty copies which had been printed to me for\r\n     correction, but at the same time instructed me to use ink on the\r\n     wretched paper and as coarsely as possible; also to cross out\r\n     several lines so that it would be impossible to make use of a\r\n     single copy or sell it. The scratching out was particularly in the\r\n     Scherzo. I obeyed his instructions implicitly, etc.\r\n\r\nNottebohm has proved that the further statements of Ries touching the\r\nmelting of the plates, etc., are wrong; but the enraged composer did\r\nmake a public statement--and very properly:\r\n\r\n    To the Lovers of Music.\r\n\r\n     In informing the public that the original Quintet in C long ago\r\n     advertised by me as having been published by Breitkopf and Härtel\r\n     in Leipsic, I declare at the same time that I have no interest in\r\n     the edition published simultaneously by Messrs. Artaria and Mollo\r\n     in Vienna. I am the more compelled to make this declaration since\r\n     this edition is very faulty, incorrect and utterly useless to\r\n     players, whereas Messrs. Breitkopf and Härtel, the legal owners of\r\n     this Quintet, have done all in their power to produce the work as\r\n     handsomely as possible.\r\n\r\n    Ludwig van Beethoven.\r\n\r\nA year later Beethoven revoked this declaration so far as it concerned\r\nMollo in the following\r\n\r\n    Announcement to the Public.\r\n\r\n     After having inserted a statement in the “Wiener Zeitung” of\r\n     January 22, 1803, in which I publicly declared that the edition of\r\n     my Quintet published by Mollo did not appear under my supervision,\r\n     was faulty in the extreme and useless to players, the undersigned\r\n     hereby revokes the statement to the extent of saying that Messrs.\r\n     Mollo and Co. have no interest in this edition, feeling that I owe\r\n     such a declaration to do justice to Messrs. Mollo and Co. before a\r\n     public entitled to respect.\r\n\r\n    Ludwig van Beethoven.\r\n\r\nAs Nottebohm has shown, Beethoven eventually agreed to revise and\r\ncorrect this edition also. A long letter to Breitkopf and Härtel, dated\r\nNovember 13, 1802, gives a lively picture of the excitement which the\r\nincident aroused in Beethoven:\r\n\r\n     I write hurriedly to inform you of only the most important\r\n     things--know then, that while I was in the country for my health,\r\n     the arch-scoundrel Artaria borrowed the Quintet from Count Friess\r\n     on the pretence that it was already published and in existence\r\n     here and that they wanted it for the purpose of reëngraving\r\n     because their copy was faulty and as a matter of fact intended\r\n     to rejoice the public with it in a few days--good Count Fr.,\r\n     deceived and not reflecting that a piece of rascality might be\r\n     in it, gave it to them--he could not ask me, I was not here, but\r\n     fortunately I learned of the matter in time, it was on Tuesday\r\n     of this week, and in my zeal to save my honor and as quickly as\r\n     possible to prevent your suffering injury, I offered two new works\r\n     to these contemptible persons if they would suppress the entire\r\n     edition, but a cooler-headed friend who was with me asked, Do you\r\n     want to reward these rascals? The case was finally closed under\r\n     conditions, they assuring me that no matter what you printed they\r\n     would reprint it, these generous scoundrels decided therefore to\r\n     wait three weeks after the receipt here of your copies before\r\n     issuing their own (insisting that Count F. had made them a\r\n     present of the copy). For one term the contract was to be closed\r\n     and for this boon I had to give them a work which I value at at\r\n     least 40 ducats. Before this contract was made comes my good\r\n     brother as if sent by heaven, he hurries to Count Fr., the whole\r\n     thing is the biggest swindle in the world, how neatly they kept\r\n     themselves out of Count F.’s way and so on, and I go to F. and\r\n     as the enclosed _Revers_ may show that I did all in my power to\r\n     protect you from injury--and my statement of the case may serve\r\n     to prove to you that no sacrifice was too great for me to save my\r\n     honor and save you from harm. From the _Revers_ you will see the\r\n     measures that must be adopted and you should make all possible\r\n     haste to send copies here and if possible at the same price as\r\n     the rascals--Sonnleithner and I will take all further measures\r\n     which seem to us good, so that their entire edition may be\r\n     destroyed--please take good notice that Mollo and Artaria combined\r\n     are already only a shop, that is, a combined lot of scoundrels.\r\n     The dedication to Friess I hope was not forgotten inasmuch as my\r\n     brother wrote it on the first sheet--I wrote the _Revers_ myself\r\n     since my poor brother is very much occupied with work yet did all\r\n     he could to save you and me, in the confusion he lost a faithful\r\n     dog which he called his favorite, he deserves that you thank him\r\n     personally as I have done on my own account--recall that from\r\n     Tuesday to late last night I devoted myself almost wholly to this\r\n     matter and the mere thought of this rascally stroke may serve to\r\n     make you realize how unpleasant it is for me to have anything to\r\n     do with such miserable men.\r\n\r\n     “_Revers._\r\n\r\n     “The undersigned pledges himself under no circumstances to send\r\n     out or sell here or elsewhere the Quintet received from Mr. Count\r\n     Friess composed by Lud. v. Beethoven until the original edition\r\n     shall have been in circulation in Vienna 14 days.\r\n\r\n    “Vienna, 9th month, 1802.\r\n\r\n    Artaria Comp.”\r\n\r\nThis _R._ is signed with its own hand by the _Comp._ Use the following:\r\nIs to be had à Vienne chez Artaria Comp., à Münich chez F. Halm, à\r\nFrancfort chez Gayl et Nädler, perhaps also in Leipsic chez Meysel--the\r\nprice is 2 florins Viennese standard. I got hold of twelve copies,\r\nwhich they promised me from the beginning, and corrected them--_the\r\nengraving is abominable_. Make use of all this, you see that on every\r\nside we have them in our hands and can proceed against them in the\r\ncourts.--_N.B._ Any personal measures taken against A. will have my\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nUnder date of December 5, 1802, Beethoven’s brother Karl wrote to\r\nBreitkopf and Härtel on the same subject:\r\n\r\n     Finally I shall inform you touching the manner in which my brother\r\n     sells his works. We already have in print 34 works and about 18\r\n     numbers. These pieces were mostly commissioned by amateurs under\r\n     the following agreement: he who wants a piece pays a fixed sum for\r\n     its exclusive possession for a half or a whole year, or longer,\r\n     and binds himself not to give the manuscript to _anybody_; at the\r\n     conclusion of the period it is the privilege of the author to do\r\n     what he pleases with the work. This was the understanding with\r\n     Count Friess. Now the Count has a certain Conti as violin teacher,\r\n     and to him Artaria turned and he probably for a consideration of\r\n     8 or 10 florins said that the quartet (_sic_) had already been\r\n     printed and was to be had everywhere. This made Count Friess\r\n     think that there was nothing more to be lost in the matter and\r\n     he gave it up without a word to us about it.... Count Friess\r\n     is not here just now, but he will return in 6 days and then we\r\n     shall see that you are recompensed in one way or another. I send\r\n     you the accompanying _Revers_ signed by Artaria for inspection;\r\n     please return it. This _Revers_ cost my brother 7 days during\r\n     which time he could do nothing, and me innumerable trips, many\r\n     unpleasantnesses and the loss of my dog.[108]\r\n\r\nBeethoven’s declaration not having been published until more than two\r\nmonths after his letter containing the _Revers_, the incidents touching\r\nwhich Ries makes report, and the partial reëngraving of the plates,\r\nmust have taken place after January, 1803, and the end of the quarrel\r\nin 1804. Sketches of the Quintet have not been found and the question\r\nnaturally arises whether or not it might have had an earlier origin or\r\nbeen developed from earlier sketches. A note in a Conversation Book\r\nof 1826, indicates that one of the Quintet’s themes was written by\r\nSchuppanzigh.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[100] Beethoven’s carelessness in respect of dates, or a characteristic\r\nindifference to the almanac, as exemplified in this date-line, plays\r\nan important rôle in one of the most puzzling questions in his\r\npersonal history, namely, the identity of the woman whom in the famous\r\nlove-letters he called “The Immortal Beloved.”\r\n\r\n[101] “L... O...”, according to Schindler as reported by Nohl,\r\nstands for “Leipsic Oxen,” the reference being to the critics of the\r\n“Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung.”\r\n\r\n[102] The Concerto in B-flat, Op. 19.\r\n\r\n[103] The Concerto in C major, Op. 15.\r\n\r\n[104] Bach is the German equivalent of brook. The daughter of Bach\r\nreferred to was Regina Johanna, in whose behalf Friedrich Rochlitz had\r\nissued an appeal. She was the youngest of Bach’s children and died on\r\nDecember 14, 1800, her last days having been spent in comfort by reason\r\nof the subscription alluded to.\r\n\r\n[105] Known in English as “The Mount of Olives.”\r\n\r\n[106] Here, for a space, the Editor reverts to the original manuscript\r\nnot employed by the German revisers, except as a foot-note.\r\n\r\n[107] “The Sonata in C-sharp minor has asked many a tear from gentle\r\nsouls who were taught to hear in its first movement a lament for\r\nunrequited love and reflected that it was dedicated to the Countess\r\nGiulia Guicciardi, for whom Beethoven assuredly had a tender feeling.\r\nMoonlight and the plaint of an unhappy lover. How affecting! But\r\nBeethoven did not compose the Sonata for the Countess, though he\r\ninscribed it to her. He had given her a Rondo, and wishing to dedicate\r\nit to another pupil, he asked for its return and in exchange sent the\r\nSonata. Moreover, it appears from evidence scarcely to be gainsaid,\r\nthat Beethoven never intended the C-sharp minor sonata as a musical\r\nexpression of love, unhappy or otherwise. In a letter dated January\r\n22, 1892 (for a copy of which I am indebted to Fräulein Lipsius [La\r\nMara] to whom it is addressed), Alexander W. Thayer, the greatest of\r\nBeethoven’s biographers, says: ‘That Mr. Kalischer has adopted Ludwig\r\nNohl’s strange notion of Beethoven’s infatuation for Therese Malfatti,\r\na girl of fourteen years, surprises me; as also that he seems to\r\nconsider the C-sharp minor Sonata to be a musical love-poem addressed\r\nto Julia Guicciardi. He ought certainly to know that the subject of\r\nthat sonata was or rather that it was suggested by--Seume’s little poem\r\n‘Die Beterin’.’ The poem referred to describes a maiden kneeling at the\r\nhigh altar in prayer for the recovery of a sick father. Her sighs and\r\npetitions ascend like the smoke of incense from the censers, angels\r\ncome to her aid, and, at the last, the face of the suppliant one glows\r\nwith the transfiguring light of hope. The poem has little to commend\r\nit as an example of literary art and it is not as easy to connect it\r\nin fancy with the last movement of the sonata as with the first and\r\nsecond: but the evidence that Beethoven paid it the tribute of his\r\nmusic seems conclusive.”--“The Pianoforte and its Music,” by H. E.\r\nKrehbiel, Charles Scribner’s Sons, pp. 163, 164.\r\n\r\nOn page 174, Vol. IV, of the German edition of this biography Dr.\r\nDeiters remarks: “The venerated Thayer, it is true, conceived the\r\nidea that Beethoven’s Fantasia and Sonata, Op. 27, No. 2, had been\r\ninspired by Seume’s ‘Beterin.’ Whoever compares the sonata with the\r\npoem will soon realize that there can be no thought of this. We have\r\nhere, no doubt, a confusion of pieces. It would be easier to think of\r\nthe Fantasia, Op. 77. Kalischer, who first recognized Thayer’s error,\r\nthought of the C-sharp minor Quartet; but this cannot have been in\r\nBeethoven’s mind, for it was composed much later.” Grossheim’s letter\r\nwas written in 1819; the C-sharp minor quartet was composed in 1826. So\r\nKalischer was ridiculously in error. But why does Dr. Deiters suggest\r\nthe Fantasia, Op. 77? Grossheim was a musician--composer, teacher and\r\nconductor--as well as philologist, and when he said “C-sharp minor” it\r\nis not likely that he was thinking of a work in G minor. Moreover, the\r\nmost admirable Dr. Deiters to the contrary notwithstanding, it is not\r\nat all difficult to associate the sonata with the poem whose picture\r\nof lamentable petition and rising clouds of incense is strikingly\r\nreproduced in suggestion by the music of the first movement. Serene\r\nhopefulness can be said to be the feeling which informs the second\r\nmovement; and why should the finale not be the musician’s continuation\r\nof the poet’s story?\r\n\r\n[108] Appendix II to the second volume of the German edition of this\r\nwork contains copies of all the documents in the legal controversies\r\nwhich arose out of Beethoven’s charges against Artaria and Co. and\r\nMollo in the matter of the unauthorized publication of the Quintet.\r\nThey do not add much that is essential to the story as it has been\r\ntold, though they show that the legal authorities upheld the publishers\r\nagainst the composer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XX\r\n\r\n     Letters of 1801--The Beginning of Beethoven’s Deafness--The\r\n     Criticisms of a Leipsic Journal--Bonn Friends in Vienna--Reicha,\r\n     Breuning, Ries, Czerny--Chronology Adjusted.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now turn back to the important letters written in the summer of\r\n1801, beginning with two written to his friend Amenda, which were first\r\npublished in the “Signale” of 1852, No. 5. The first, without date or\r\nrecord of place, is as follows:\r\n\r\n     How can Amenda doubt that I shall always remember him[109] because\r\n     I do not write or have not written to him--as if memory could only\r\n     be preserved in such a manner.\r\n\r\n     A thousand times the best of all men that I ever learned to know\r\n     comes into my mind--yes, of the two men who had my entire love, of\r\n     which one still lives, you are the third--how can recollection of\r\n     you die out of my mind. You shall soon receive a long letter from\r\n     me concerning my present condition and everything about me that\r\n     might interest you. Farewell, dear, good, noble friend, keep me\r\n     always in your love, your friendship, as I shall forever remain\r\n\r\n    Your faithful\r\n\r\n    Beethoven.\r\n\r\nThe longer letter which he had promised to send to his friend is dated\r\nJune 1, 1801:\r\n\r\nTHE COMPOSER’S HEALTH IN 1801\r\n\r\n     My dear, good Amenda, my cordial friend, I received and read your\r\n     last letter with mixed pain and pleasure. To what shall I compare\r\n     your fidelity, your attachment to me. Oh, it is so beautiful that\r\n     you have always been true to me and I know how to single you out\r\n     and keep you above all others. You are not a Viennese friend,\r\n     no, you are one of those who spring from the ground of my native\r\n     land. How often do I wish you were with me, for your Beethoven is\r\n     living an unhappy life, quarreling with nature and its creator,\r\n     often cursing the latter because he surrendered his creatures to\r\n     the merest accident which sometimes broke or destroyed the most\r\n     beautiful blossoms. Know that my noblest faculty, my hearing,\r\n     has greatly deteriorated. When you were still with me I felt the\r\n     symptoms but kept silent; now it is continually growing worse, and\r\n     whether or not a cure is possible has become a question; but it\r\n     is said to be due to my bowels and so far as they are concerned\r\n     I am nearly restored to health. I hope, indeed that my hearing\r\n     will also improve, but I am dubious because such diseases are the\r\n     most incurable. How sad is my lot! I must avoid all things that\r\n     are dear to me and live amongst such miserable and egotistical\r\n     men as ... and ... and others. I must say that amongst them all\r\n     Lichnowsky is the most satisfactory, since last year he has\r\n     settled an income of 600 florins on me and the good sale of my\r\n     works enables me to live without care. I could sell everything\r\n     that I compose five times over and at a good price. I have written\r\n     considerably of late, and as I hear that you have ordered a\r\n     pianoforte from ... I will send you various things in the box of\r\n     the instrument so that it need not cost you much. To my comfort\r\n     there has lately come a man with whom I can share the pleasures\r\n     of association, an unselfish friendship; he is one of the friends\r\n     of my youth. I have often spoken of you to him and told him that\r\n     since I left my fatherland you have been the only choice of my\r\n     heart. ... is not very satisfactory to him--he is and always will\r\n     be too weak for friendship. I use him and ... only as instruments\r\n     on which I play when I please but they can never become witnesses\r\n     of my whole internal and external activities or real participants\r\n     (in my feelings). I estimate them at only what they are worth\r\n     to me. Oh, how happy would I be if my hearing were completely\r\n     restored; then would I hurry to you, but as it is I must refrain\r\n     from everything and the most beautiful years of my life must pass\r\n     without accomplishing the promise of my talent and powers. A sad\r\n     resignation to which I must resort although, indeed, I am resolved\r\n     to rise superior to every obstacle. But how will that be possible?\r\n     Yes, Amenda, if my infirmity shows itself to be incurable in half\r\n     a year, I shall appeal to you; you must abandon everything and\r\n     come to me. My affliction causes me the least trouble in playing\r\n     and composing, the most in association with others, and you must\r\n     be my companion. I am sure my fortune will not desert me. What\r\n     might I not essay? Since you have been gone I have composed\r\n     everything except operas and church-music. You will not deny me;\r\n     you will help your friend bear his cares and affliction. I have\r\n     also greatly bettered my pianoforte playing and I hope the journey\r\n     will, perhaps, make your fortune; afterward you will remain with\r\n     me. I have received all of your letters and despite the fact that\r\n     I answered so few you were always with me and my heart still beats\r\n     as tenderly for you as ever it did. I beg of you to keep the\r\n     matter of my deafness a profound secret to _be confided to nobody\r\n     no matter who it is_. Write to me very often. Your letters, no\r\n     matter how short, comfort me, do me good, and I shall soon expect\r\n     another from you, my dear fellow. Do not lend your quartet to\r\n     anybody because I have changed it greatly having just learned how\r\n     properly to write quartets, as you will observe when you receive\r\n     it. Now, farewell, my dear, good fellow; if you think I can do\r\n     something for you here, command me as a matter of course.\r\n\r\n    Your faithful, and truly affectionate\r\n    L. v. Beethoven.\r\n\r\nIn the same month Beethoven wrote again to the publisher Hoffmeister to\r\nthis effect:\r\n\r\n     I am a little amazed at what you have communicated to me through\r\n     the local representative of your business. I am almost vexed to\r\n     think that you consider me capable of such a trick.\r\n\r\n     It would be a different matter if I had sold my wares only\r\n     to avaricious tradesmen hoping that they would make a good\r\n     speculation on the sly, but _as artist towards artist_ it is a bit\r\n     harsh to think such things of me. It looks to me as if the whole\r\n     matter had been planned to test me or to be merely a suspicion;\r\n     in either case I inform you that before you received the Septet\r\n     from me I sent it to London to Mr. Salomon (for performance at\r\n     his concerts out of mere friendship) but with the understanding\r\n     that he should have a care that it should not fall into the hands\r\n     of strangers, because I intended that it should be published in\r\n     Germany, concerning which, if you think it necessary, you may\r\n     make inquiry of him. But in order to prove my honesty _I give you\r\n     the assurance herewith that I have not sold the Septet, Concerto,\r\n     the Symphony and the Sonata to anybody but you, Hoffmeister and\r\n     Kühnel, and that you may consider it (sic) as your exclusive\r\n     property and to this I pledge my honor_. You may make such use of\r\n     this assurance as you please.\r\n\r\n     As for the rest I believe as little that Salomon is capable of\r\n     being guilty of having the Septet printed as I am of having\r\n     sold it to him. I am so conscientious that I have denied the\r\n     applications of _various publishers_ to print the pianoforte\r\n     arrangement of the Septet, and yet I do not know whether or not\r\n     you intend to make such use of it.\r\n\r\nOn June 29, he sent the following longer letter to Wegeler, who\r\npublished it in his “Notizen”:\r\n\r\n    Vienna, June 29.\r\n\r\n    My good, dear Wegeler!\r\n\r\n     GREETINGS TO OLD FRIENDS IN BONN\r\n\r\n     How greatly do I thank you for thinking of me; I have so little\r\n     deserved it and so little tried to deserve anything from you, and\r\n     yet you are so very good and refuse to be held aloof by anything,\r\n     not even by my unpardonable remissness, remaining always my true,\r\n     good, brave friend. Do not believe that I could forget you who\r\n     were always so dear to me. No. There are moments when I long for\r\n     you and would like to be with you. My fatherland, the beautiful\r\n     region in which I first saw the light, is still as clear and\r\n     beautiful before my eyes as when I left you. In short, I shall\r\n     look upon that period as one of the happiest incidents of my\r\n     life when I shall see you again and greet Father Rhine. When\r\n     this shall be I cannot now tell you--but I want to say that you\r\n     will see me again only as a great man. Yon shall receive me as\r\n     a great artist but as a better and more perfect man, and if the\r\n     conditions are improved in our fatherland my art shall be employed\r\n     in the service of the poor. O happy moment! How happy am I that I\r\n     created thee--can invoke thee!... You want to know something about\r\n     my situation. It is not so bad. Since last year, unbelievable as\r\n     it may sound, even after I tell you, Lichnowsky, who has always\r\n     remained my warmest friend (there were little quarrels between\r\n     us, but they only served to strengthen our friendship), set aside\r\n     a fixed sum of 600 florins for me to draw against so long as I\r\n     remained without a position worthy of me. From my compositions I\r\n     have a large income and I may say that I have more commissions\r\n     than it is possible for me to fill. Besides, I have 6 or 7\r\n     publishers and might have more if I chose; they no longer bargain\r\n     with me--I ask, and they pay. You see it is very convenient. For\r\n     instance, I see a friend in need and my purse does not permit\r\n     me to help him at once. I have only to sit down and in a short\r\n     time help is at hand. Moreover, I am a better business man than\r\n     formerly. If I remain here always I shall bring it to pass that I\r\n     shall always reserve a day for my concert of which I give several.\r\n     The only pity is that my evil demon, my bad health, is continually\r\n     putting a spoke in my wheel, by which I mean that my hearing has\r\n     grown steadily worse for three years for which my bowels, which\r\n     you know were always wretched and have been getting worse, since\r\n     I am always troubled with a dysentery, in addition to unusual\r\n     weakness, are said to be responsible. Frank wanted to tone up my\r\n     body by tonic medicines and restore my hearing with almond oil,\r\n     but, _prosit_, nothing came of the effort; my hearing grew worse\r\n     and worse, and my bowels remained as they had been. This lasted\r\n     until the autumn of last year and I was often in despair. Then\r\n     came a medical ass who advised me to take cold baths, a more\r\n     sensible one to take the usual lukewarm Danube bath. That worked\r\n     wonders; my bowels improved, my hearing remained, or became\r\n     worse. I was really miserable during this winter; I had frightful\r\n     attacks of colic and I fell back into my previous condition, and\r\n     so things remained until about four weeks ago, when I went to\r\n     Vering, thinking that my condition demanded a surgeon, and having\r\n     great confidence in him. He succeeded almost wholly in stopping\r\n     the awful diarrhœa. He prescribed the lukewarm Danube bath, into\r\n     which I had each time to pour a little bottle of strengthening\r\n     stuff, gave me no medicine of any kind until about four weeks\r\n     ago, when he prescribed pills for my stomach and a kind of tea\r\n     for my ear. Since then I can say I am stronger and better; only\r\n     my ears whistle and buzz continually, day and night. I can say I\r\n     am living a wretched life; for two years I have avoided almost\r\n     all social gatherings because it is impossible for me to say to\r\n     people: “I am deaf.” If I belonged to any other profession it\r\n     would be easier, but in my profession it is an awful state, the\r\n     more since my enemies, who are not few, what would they say? In\r\n     order to give you an idea of this singular deafness of mine I\r\n     must tell you that in the theatre I must get very close to the\r\n     orchestra in order to understand the actor. If I am a little\r\n     distant I do not hear the high tones of the instruments, singers,\r\n     and if I be but a little farther away I do not hear at all.\r\n     Frequently I can hear the tones of a low conversation, but not the\r\n     words, and as soon as anybody shouts it is intolerable. It seems\r\n     singular that in conversation there are people who do not notice\r\n     my condition at all, attributing it to my absent-mindedness.[110]\r\n     Heaven knows what will happen to me. _Vering says that there will\r\n     be an improvement if no complete cure._ I have often--cursed my\r\n     existence; _Plutarch_ taught me resignation. If possible I will\r\n     bid defiance to my fate, although there will be moments in my life\r\n     when I shall be the unhappiest of God’s creatures. I beg of you to\r\n     say nothing of my condition to anybody, not even to Lorchen;[111]\r\n     I entrust the secret only to you; I would be glad if you were to\r\n     correspond with Vering on the subject. If my condition continues\r\n     I will go to you next spring; you could hire a house for me in\r\n     some pretty place in the country and for half a year I would be\r\n     a farmer. This might bring about a change. Resignation! What a\r\n     wretched refuge--and yet the only one open to me. Forgive me that\r\n     I add these cares of friendship to yours which is sorrowful enough\r\n     as it is. Steffen Breuning is here now and we are together almost\r\n     daily; it does me so much good to revive the old emotions. He is\r\n     really become a good, splendid youngster, who knows a thing or\r\n     two, and like us all has his heart in the right place. I have a\r\n     pretty domicile on the bastion which is doubly valuable because\r\n     of my health. I believe I shall make it possible for Breuning to\r\n     come to me. You shall have your Antioch[112] and also many musical\r\n     compositions of mine if you do not think they will cost you too\r\n     much. Honestly, your love for art still delights me much. Write to\r\n     me how it is to be done and I will send you all my compositions,\r\n     already a goodly number and increasing daily.... In return for the\r\n     portrait of my grandfather which I beg of you to send me as soon\r\n     as possible by mail-coach, I am sending you that of his grandson,\r\n     your good and affectionate Beethoven, which is to be published\r\n     here by Artaria, who, like many others, including art-dealers,\r\n     have often asked me for it. I shall soon write to Stoffel[113] and\r\n     give him a piece of my mind concerning his stubborn disposition.\r\n     I will make his ears ring with the old friendship, and he shall\r\n     promise me by all that is holy not to offend you further in your\r\n     present state of unhappiness. I shall also write to good Lorche.\r\n     I have never forgotten one of you good people even if I did not\r\n     write to you; but you know that writing was never my forte; the\r\n     best of my friends have not had a letter from me in years. I\r\n     live only in my notes and when one composition is scarcely ended\r\n     another is already begun. As I compose at present I frequently\r\n     work on three or four compositions at the same time. Write to\r\n     me often, hereafter. I will try occasionally to find time to\r\n     write to you. Give greetings to all, including the good Madame\r\n     Councillor,[114] and tell her that I still occasionally have a\r\n     “raptus.” As regards K. I do not at all wonder over his change.\r\n     Fortune is round, like a ball, and therefore does not always drop\r\n     on the noblest and best. A word about Ries, whom I greet heartily;\r\n     so far as his son is concerned I shall write you more in detail,\r\n     although I think that he would be more fortunate in Paris than\r\n     in Vienna. Vienna is overcrowded and the most meritorious find\r\n     it extremely difficult to maintain themselves. In the autumn or\r\n     winter I shall see what I can do for him, for at that time the\r\n     public hurries back to the city. Farewell, good, faithful Wegeler!\r\n     Be assured of the love and friendship of\r\n\r\n    Your\r\n\r\n    Beethoven.\r\n\r\nOn November 16, he wrote in greater detail to Wegeler:\r\n\r\n    My good Wegeler!\r\n\r\n     I thank you for the new evidence of concern in my behalf, all the\r\n     more since I deserve so little at your hands. You want to know\r\n     how it goes with me, what I need; as little as I like to discuss\r\n     such matters I would rather do it with you than with others.\r\n\r\n     DEAFNESS AND A ROMANTIC ATTACHMENT\r\n\r\n     For several months Vering has had vesicatories placed on both\r\n     arms, which consist, as you know, of a certain bark.[115] This is\r\n     a very unpleasant remedy, inasmuch as I am robbed of the free use\r\n     of my arms (for a few days, until the bark has had its effect), to\r\n     say nothing of the pain. It is true I cannot deny that the ringing\r\n     and sounding in my ears has become less than usual, especially in\r\n     the left ear, where my deafness began; but my hearing has not been\r\n     improved and I dare not say that it has not grown worse rather\r\n     than better. My bowels are in a better condition, especially after\r\n     the lukewarm baths for a few days when I feel quite well for 8 or\r\n     10 days, seldom needing a tonic for my stomach. I am beginning\r\n     to use the herbs on the belly as suggested by you. Vering will\r\n     hear nothing of plunge baths, and I am thoroughly dissatisfied\r\n     with him; he has much too little care and consideration for such\r\n     a disease; if I did not go to him, which costs me a great deal\r\n     of trouble, I should not see him at all. What do you think of\r\n     Schmidt? I do not like to change, but it seems to me Vering is\r\n     too much of a practitioner to acquire new ideas. Schmidt seems\r\n     to me a very different sort of man and, perhaps, would not be so\r\n     negligent. Miracles are told of _galvanism_; what have you to say\r\n     about it? A doctor told me that he had seen a deaf and dumb child\r\n     recover his hearing (in Berlin) again--and a man who had been\r\n     deaf 7 years got well. I am living more pleasantly since I live\r\n     more amongst men. You will scarcely believe how lonely and sad my\r\n     life was for two years; my bad hearing haunted me everywhere like\r\n     a ghost and I fled from mankind and seemed like a misanthrope,\r\n     though far from being one. This change has been wrought by a\r\n     _dear, fascinating_ girl who loves me and whom I love. There have\r\n     been a few blessed moments within the last two years and it is the\r\n     first time that I feel that marriage might bring me happiness.\r\n     Alas! she is not of my station--and now--it would be impossible\r\n     for me to marry. I must still hustle about most actively. If it\r\n     were not for my deafness, I should before now have travelled over\r\n     half the world, and that I must do. There is no greater delight\r\n     for me than to practise and show my art. Do not believe that I\r\n     would be happy with you. What is there that could make me happier?\r\n     Even your care would give me pain. I would see pity on your faces\r\n     every minute and be only the unhappier. What did those beautiful\r\n     native regions bestow upon me? Nothing except the hope of a better\r\n     state of health, which would have come had not this affliction\r\n     seized upon me. Oh, if I were rid of this affliction I could\r\n     embrace the world! I feel that my youth is just beginning and\r\n     have I not always been ill? My physical strength has for a short\r\n     time past been steadily growing more than ever and also my mental\r\n     powers. Day by day I am approaching the goal which I apprehend\r\n     but cannot describe. It is only in this that your Beethoven can\r\n     live. Tell me nothing of rest. I know of none but sleep, and woe\r\n     is me that I must give up more time to it than usual. Grant me but\r\n     half freedom from my affliction and then--as a complete, ripe man\r\n     I shall return to you and renew the old feelings of friendship.\r\n     You must see me as happy as it is possible to be here below--not\r\n     unhappy. No! I cannot endure it. I will take Fate by the throat;\r\n     it shall not wholly overcome me. Oh, it is so beautiful to\r\n     live--to live a thousand times! I feel that I am not made for a\r\n     quiet life. You will write to me as soon as you can. See that\r\n     Steffen secures an appointment of some kind in the _Teutonic\r\n     Order_. Life here is connected with too many hardships for his\r\n     health. Besides, he lives so isolated an existence that I cannot\r\n     see how he is to get along in this manner. You know the state of\r\n     affairs here. I will not say that social life may not lessen his\r\n     moodiness; but it is impossible to persuade him to go anywhere.\r\n     A short time ago I had a _musicale_ at my home; yet our friend\r\n     Steffen did not come. Advise him to seek more rest and composure.\r\n     I have done my best in this direction; without these he will never\r\n     be again happy or well. Tell me in your next letter whether or not\r\n     it will matter if I send you a great deal of my music; you can\r\n     sell what you do not need and so get back the post-money--and my\r\n     portrait. All possible lovely and necessary greetings to Lorchen,\r\n     Mama and Christoph. You love me a little, do you not? Be assured\r\n     of the love and friendship of\r\n\r\n    Your\r\n    Beethoven.\r\n\r\nA commentary upon these letters--the first two excepted, which need\r\nnone--might be made, by a moderate indulgence of poetic fancy, to fill\r\na volume of respectable size; but rigidly confined to prosaic fact may\r\nbe reduced to reasonable dimensions. Taking up the letters in their\r\norder, the first is that to Hoffmeister of April 22nd.\r\n\r\nI. One of the earliest projects of the new firm of Hoffmeister and\r\nKühnel was the publication of “J. Sebastian Bach’s Theoretical and\r\nPractical Clavier and Organ Works.” The first number contained: 1,\r\nToccata in D-flat; 2, fifteen inventions; 3, “The Well-Tempered\r\nClavichord”--in part; the second number: 1, 15 symphonies in three\r\nvoices; 2, continuation of “The Well-Tempered Clavichord.” Now compare\r\nwhat Schindler says (third edition, II, 184):\r\n\r\n     Of the archfather Johann Sebastian Bach the stock was a very\r\n     small one except for a few motets which had been sung at the\r\n     house of van Swieten; besides these the majority of pieces were\r\n     those familiarly known, namely, the “Well-Tempered Clavichord,”\r\n     which showed signs of diligent study, three volumes of exercises,\r\n     fifteen inventions, fifteen symphonies and a toccata in D minor.\r\n     This collection of pieces in _a single volume_ is to be found in\r\n     my possession. Attached to these was a sheet of paper on which, in\r\n     a strange handwriting, was to be read the following passage from\r\n     J. N. Forkel’s book “On the Life and Artwork of Johann Sebastian\r\n     Bach”: “The pretence that the musical art is an art for _all_ ears\r\n     cannot be substantiated by Bach, but is disproved by the mere\r\n     existence and uniqueness of his works, which seem to be destined\r\n     only for connoisseurs. Only the connoisseur who can surmise the\r\n     inner organization and feel it and penetrate to the intention of\r\n     the artist, which does nothing needlessly, is privileged to judge\r\n     here; indeed, the judgment of a musical connoisseur can scarcely\r\n     be better tested than by seeing how rightly he has learned\r\n     the works of Bach.” On both sides of this passage there were\r\n     interrogation points from the thickest note-pen of Beethoven as a\r\n     gloss on the learned historian and most eminent of all Bachians.\r\n     No Hogarth could have put a grimmer look, or a more crushing\r\n     expression, into an interrogation point.\r\n\r\nNägele, who professed long to have entertained the design to publish\r\nBach’s “most admirable works,” issued his proposals in February,\r\nwritten with some degree of asperity against “the double competition”\r\nwhich, he had already learned, “was confronting” him. Of his edition of\r\n“The Well-Tempered Clavichord” Beethoven also possessed a part.\r\n\r\nThe names left blank in publishing this letter are easily supplied.\r\nBaron Carl August von Liechtenstein, the same to whom, from 1825\r\nto 1832, was confided the management of the opera in Berlin, who\r\ndied there in 1845, had been so extravagantly praised as head of\r\nthe Princely Music at Dessau that he was called to assume the\r\nchapelmastership of the Imperial Opera in Vienna near the end of\r\n1800. The contemporary reports of his efficiency as conductor are\r\nhighly favorable. He deserves the credit of determining to add to\r\nthe repertory of the Imperial Opera Mozart’s “Zauberflöte” which,\r\ntill then, had been heard by the Viennese only in the little theatre\r\nAuf-den-Wieden. It is worth mentioning that Liechtenstein brought\r\nwith him from Dessau poor Neefe’s daughter Felice, now Mme. Rösner,\r\nand that she was the _Pamina_ of this performance. In the first new\r\nwork produced (April 16th) upon the imperial stage after Beethoven’s\r\n“Prometheus” music, Liechtenstein introduced himself to the Vienna\r\npublic in the character of a composer. It was in his opera “Bathmendi,”\r\ncompletely revised. The result was a wretched failure. Hoffmeister’s\r\nlong and familiar acquaintance with Vienna, its musicians and its\r\ntheatres, would cause him readily to appreciate the fun and wit of\r\nBeethoven’s remark that the newly engaged chapelmaster and composer\r\nof the Imperial Opera “seems to have taken for an ideal Mr. M.\r\n(Müller)”--the Offenbach of that time--but without reaching “even him.”\r\nConsidering that the Baron was yet a young man, at the most but three\r\nyears older than Beethoven, the somewhat bitter remark which follows\r\nthe jest appears natural enough.\r\n\r\nTHE COMPOSER AND HIS EARLY CRITICS\r\n\r\nII. Beethoven had just cause for indignation in the treatment which\r\nhe had received at the hands of the writers for the “Allgemeine\r\nMusikalische Zeitung” (the “Leipsic oxen” of his letter of January\r\n15th). Hoffmeister had evidently written him on the subject, and\r\nhis reticence in confining himself in reply to a single contemptuous\r\nsentence, though writing in the confidence of private correspondence,\r\nis something unexpected; not less so is the manly, dignified and\r\ningenuous style of his answer to Breitkopf and Härtel upon the same\r\ntopic in the letter of April 22nd. The first number of that famous\r\nmusical journal (take it for all in all, the noblest ever published)\r\nappeared October 3rd, 1798, edited by Rochlitz, published by Breitkopf\r\nand Härtel. In the second number, “Z...” eulogizes the Six Fughettos\r\nof the lad, C. M. von Weber; in the tenth young Hummel’s sonatas, Op.\r\n3, are reviewed; in the fifteenth the name of Beethoven first appears,\r\nviz.: in the title of three sonatas dedicated to him by Wölffl. At\r\nlength, in No. 23, March 17th, 1799, he is introduced to the readers\r\nof the journal as an author--not of one or more of the eight Trios,\r\nten Sonatas, the Quintet and Serenade, which make up the _opera_ 1 to\r\n11 then published--but as the writer of the Twelve Variations on “Ein\r\nMädchen oder Weibchen,” and eight on “Une fièvre brûlante.”\r\n\r\nThe criticisms are a perfect reflex of the conventional musical thought\r\nof the period and can be read now with amused interest, at least. There\r\nis no room here for their production in full. The writer, “M...,”\r\nrecognizes the clever pianoforte player in the Variations but cannot\r\nsee evidences in them of equal capacity as a composer. He likes some\r\nof them and “willingly admits” that those on “Une fièvre brûlante” are\r\n“more successful than those of Mozart, who in his early youth also\r\ntreated the same subject.” But Mozart did not write the variations\r\nreferred to, and when Grétry’s “Richard Cœur de Lion,” from which the\r\ntheme was borrowed, was first performed in Paris, Mozart was not in his\r\n“early youth” but 28 years old. The critic descants with disapproval on\r\n“certain harshnesses in the modulations,” illustrating them; holds up\r\nHaydn as a model chooser of themes, and commends the comments of Vogler\r\non a set of variations on “God save the King” printed in a little\r\nbook on the subject. Thus Beethoven found, in the first recognition\r\nof himself as a composer in that journal, two compositions which he\r\ndid not think worthy of opus numbers, to the neglect of all his better\r\nworks, made the subject of censure and ridicule for the purpose of\r\nputting and advertising a pamphlet by Vogler. Were his own subsequent\r\nVariations on “God save the King” an effect of this article?\r\n\r\nNo. 23 of the “Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung” contains nearly two\r\npages from the pen of Spazier on Liechtenstein’s opera, “Die steinerne\r\nBraut,” and a parallel between Beethoven and Wölffl as pianists. Then\r\nin the next number the beautiful Trio, Op. 6, finds a reviewer. Here is\r\nthe whole of his article:\r\n\r\n     This Trio, which in part is not easier but more flowing than many\r\n     other pieces by the same author, makes an excellent ensemble on\r\n     the pianoforte with accompaniment. The composer with his unusual\r\n     harmonic knowledge and love for serious composition would provide\r\n     us many things which would leave many hand-organ things far in the\r\n     rear, even those composed by famous men, if he would but try to\r\n     write more naturally.\r\n\r\nCould one say less?\r\n\r\nThe “Leipsic oxen” are now ruminating upon the noble Sonatas for\r\nPianoforte and Violin, Op. 12, and No. 36 (June, 1799), contains the\r\nresult:\r\n\r\n     The critic, who heretofore has been unfamiliar with the pianoforte\r\n     pieces of the author, must admit, after having looked through\r\n     these strange sonatas, overladen with difficulties, that after\r\n     diligent and strenuous labor he felt like a man who had hoped to\r\n     make a promenade with a genial friend through a tempting forest\r\n     and found himself barred every minute by inimical barriers,\r\n     returning at last exhausted and without having had any pleasure.\r\n     It is undeniable that Mr. Beethoven goes his own gait; but what\r\n     a bizarre and singular gait it is! Learned, learned and always\r\n     learned--and nothing natural, no song. Yes, to be accurate, there\r\n     is _only a mass of learning here, without good method_; obstinacy,\r\n     but for which we feel but little interest; a striving for strange\r\n     modulations, an objection to customary associations, a heaping up\r\n     of difficulties on difficulties till one loses all patience and\r\n     enjoyment. Another critic (M. Z., No. 24) has said almost the same\r\n     thing, and the present writer must agree with him completely.\r\n\r\n     Nevertheless, the present work must not be rejected wholly. It\r\n     has its value and may be of excellent use for already practised\r\n     pianoforte players. There are always many who love difficulties\r\n     in invention and composition, what we might call perversities,\r\n     and if they play these Sonatas with great precision they may\r\n     derive delight in the music as well as an agreeable feeling of\r\n     satisfaction. If Mr. v. B. wished to deny himself a bit more\r\n     and follow the course of nature he might, with his talent and\r\n     industry, do a great deal for an instrument which he seems to have\r\n     so wonderfully under his control.\r\n\r\nLet us pass on to No. 38 of the journal, where we find half a dozen\r\nnotices to arrest our attention. Variations by Schuppanzigh for\r\ntwo violins are “written in good taste and conveniently for the\r\ninstrument”; variations for the pianoforte by Philip Freund are very\r\nsatisfactory and “some among them belong to the best of their kind”;\r\nvariations by Heinrich Eppinger for violin and violoncello “deserve\r\nhonorable mention”; but “X Variations pour le clavecin sur le Duo\r\n‘La stessa, la stessissima’ par L. v. Beethoven” the critic “cannot\r\nat all be satisfied with, because they are stiff and strained; and\r\nwhat awkward passages are in them, where harsh tirades in continuous\r\nsemitones create an ugly relationship and the reverse! No; it is true;\r\nMr. van Beethoven may be able to improvise, but he does not know how to\r\nwrite variations.”\r\n\r\nCHANGE IN THE TONE OF CRITICISM\r\n\r\nNow, however, the tide begins to turn. After an interval of nearly four\r\nmonths, in No. 2 of Vol. II (October, 1799), the Sonatas, Op. 12, for\r\nPianoforte and Violin have a page allotted to them. A few sentences to\r\nshow the tone of the article will suffice; for the praise of Beethoven\r\nneeds no repetition:\r\n\r\n     It is not to be denied that Mr. v. B. is a man of genius,\r\n     possessed of originality and who goes his own way. In this he is\r\n     assured by his extraordinary thoroughness in the higher style\r\n     of writing and his unusual command of the instrument for which\r\n     he writes, he being unquestionably one of the best pianoforte\r\n     composers and players of our time. His abundance of ideas, of\r\n     which a striving genius never seems to be able to let go so soon\r\n     as it has got possession of a subject worthy of his fancy, only\r\n     too frequently leads him to pile up ideas, etc. Fancy, in the\r\n     extraordinary degree which Beethoven possesses, supported, too, by\r\n     extraordinary knowledge, is a valuable possession, and, indeed,\r\n     an indispensable one for a composer, etc. The critic, who, after\r\n     he has tried to accustom himself more and more to Mr. Beethoven’s\r\n     manner, has learned to admire him more than he did at first,\r\n     can scarcely suppress the wish that ... it might occur to this\r\n     fanciful composer to practise a certain economy in his labors....\r\n     This tenth collection, as the critic has said, seems deserving\r\n     of high praise. Good invention, an earnest, manly style, ...\r\n     well-ordered thoughts in every part, difficulties not carried to\r\n     an excess, an entertaining treatment of the harmony--lift these\r\n     Sonatas above the many.\r\n\r\nIn No. 21 (February, 1800) justice is done to the “Sonate pathétique.”\r\nExcept a passing notice of the publication of the Quartets, Op. 18,\r\nmade by a correspondent, Vol. III of the “Allg. Mus. Zeitung” contains\r\n_nothing_ on the works of Beethoven. So that more than a year passed\r\nbetween the favorable review of the “Sonate pathétique” and the letter\r\nto Breitkopf and Härtel of April 22nd. The mild tone of that missive\r\nis, therefore, easily explained. The tone of the journal had completely\r\nchanged; this fact, and time, had assuaged Beethoven’s wrath, and\r\nfinally the publishers in applying to him for manuscripts had made the\r\n_amende honorable_.\r\n\r\nIn the number of May 26th begins, with a notice of the two Sonatas for\r\nPianoforte and Violin, Op. 23 and Op. 24, that long series of fair,\r\ncandid and generously eulogistic articles on Beethoven’s works which\r\nculminated in July, 1810, in the magnificent review of the C minor\r\nSymphony by E. T. A. Hoffmann--a labor of love that laid the foundation\r\nof a new school of musical criticism.\r\n\r\nIII. Upon the last topic of the letter to Breitkopf and Härtel\r\nsomething remains to be said. It was in the “Intelligenzblatt” of the\r\n“Allg. Mus. Zeit.” for May, 1800, that Rochlitz made a touching appeal\r\nfor aid for the last survivor of Sebastian Bach’s children. “This\r\nfamily,” says he, “has now died out down to the single daughter of\r\nthe great Sebastian Bach, and this daughter is now very old.... This\r\ndaughter is starving.... The publishers of the ‘Musik Zeitung’ and I\r\noffer to obligate if anybody shall entrust us with money to forward it\r\nin the most expeditious and careful manner, and to give account of it\r\nin the ‘Intelligenzblätter’.” The first account is in the paper for\r\nDecember. Regina Susanna Bach publishes her “thanks” for 96 thalers\r\nand 5 silbergroschens contributed, as the “careful account” which is\r\nappended shows, by sixteen persons, four of whom, in Vienna, sent more\r\nthan 80 florins, leaving certainly but a small sum as the offering of\r\n“her Germany.” One other--and only one--account appears, in June, 1801.\r\nIt is an acknowledgment by Rochlitz, Breitkopf and Härtel and Fräulein\r\nBach of having received on May 10th the considerable sum of 307 florins\r\nViennese (the equal of 200 thalers)\r\n\r\n     through the Viennese musician Andreas Streicher, collected by\r\n     Streicher and Count Fries. At the same time the famous Viennese\r\n     composer Herr van Beethoven declares that he will publish one of\r\n     his newest works solely for the benefit of the daughter of Bach\r\n     ... so that the good old lady may derive the benefit of it from\r\n     time to time. Therefore he nobly urges that the publication be\r\n     hastened as much as possible lest the daughter of Bach die before\r\n     his object be attained.\r\n\r\nWhether or not any such work was published is not known. Unsupported\r\nconjectures as to the names left blank in the letter to Amenda when\r\noriginally printed in the “Signale” are of no use, and if made might\r\nhereafter expose the conjecturer to just ridicule; there remain, then,\r\nbut two topics which require a word of comment--the year omitted in\r\nthe date, and the friend of his youth of whom Beethoven speaks in\r\nsuch strong terms of affection--both of which, however, may better be\r\ndisposed of, in what is to be said upon the letter to Wegeler of June\r\n29th.\r\n\r\nThis long, important and very interesting paper affords an illustration\r\nof the readiness with which a conjecture may be accepted as a truth,\r\nuntil one is compelled to subject it to rigid examination. Thus,\r\nin using this letter for a particular purpose,[116] Wegeler’s date\r\n“most probably 1800” was accepted, as it had universally been for\r\nforty years, without question; but the moment it became necessary\r\nto subject its entire contents to careful scrutiny, for the purposes\r\nof this biography, the error became at once so apparent as really to\r\nawaken a feeling of mortification for the temporary blindness that\r\nallowed it to pass unquestioned. The allusions to Susanna Bach (“You\r\nsee it is very convenient, etc.”), to his change of lodgings, to the\r\npublication of his portrait by Artaria, and (in the second letter)\r\nto the change of his physicians, are all more or less indicative\r\nof the true date, 1801, while the mention of Breuning’s return to\r\nVienna is proof positive. Finally, the similarity, almost identity,\r\nof passages in the Amenda letter to portions of this, shows that the\r\ntwo belong to the same June. Thus we at last have the gratification\r\nof seeing these two valuable documents fall easily and naturally into\r\ntheir true place in Beethoven’s history. It is worth noting that this\r\nWegeler letter offers--at the least, appears to offer--an example of\r\nBeethoven’s occasional loose way of making statements; as in the letter\r\nto Breitkopf and Härtel he writes as if he had half a dozen unpublished\r\nconcertos on hand, so now he speaks of having “already given several”\r\n_Akademien_; and yet the most careful research has failed to show that\r\nhis concerts were at this time more than three in number in all; or\r\nthat he had ever even given more than one public concert in Vienna.\r\nPerhaps, however, he may have included those given in Prague in his\r\n“several.” As nothing can be added to his account of his bad health and\r\nincipient deafness, we pass to the passages upon Breuning and Ries.\r\n\r\nARRIVAL IN VIENNA OF ANTON REICHA\r\n\r\nIV. The opinion was before expressed, that the “man” spoken of in the\r\nAmenda letter as having come to Vienna, to Beethoven’s comfort, was\r\nAnton Reicha.[117] They were alike in age--Reicha being but a few\r\nmonths the elder--and alike in tastes and pursuits. Reicha was superior\r\nin the culture of schools and in what is called musical learning;\r\nBeethoven in genius and originality as a composer and in skill as a\r\npianist. The talents of each commanded the respect of the other. Both\r\nwere aspiring, ambitious, yet diverged sufficiently in their views of\r\nart to prevent all invidious rivalry. Reicha gained a reputation which,\r\nin process of time, secured him the high position which he held during\r\nthe last twenty years of his life--that of Méhul’s successor in the\r\nParis Conservatoire.\r\n\r\nTo Beethoven, who was still digesting plans for musical tours, the\r\nexperience of his friend must have been of great value; not less to\r\nReicha the experience of Beethoven in Vienna. But he was by no means\r\ndependent upon Beethoven for an introduction into the highest musical\r\ncircles of the capital. It has been shown in a previous chapter how\r\nfreely the salons were opened to every talented young musician, but\r\nbeyond this he bore a well-known name and the veteran Haydn kindly\r\nremembered him as one of the promising young men who had paid him\r\ntheir respects in Bonn. His opera “Ubaldi” was performed in Prince\r\nLobkowitz’s palace, and this probably led to his introduction to the\r\nEmpress Maria Theresia, who gave him an Italian libretto, “Argene\r\nRegina di Granata,” for composition, in which the Empress herself sang\r\na part at the private performance in the palace.\r\n\r\nThus Beethoven and Reicha again met and lived on equal terms. “We spent\r\nfourteen years together,”[118] said the latter, “as closely united as\r\nOrestes and Pylades, and were always together in our youth. After an\r\neight years’ separation we met each other again in Vienna and confided\r\nall our experiences to each other.”\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN AND STEPHAN VON BREUNING\r\n\r\nV. When Wegeler says of Stephan von Breuning, “But he had, with short\r\ninterruptions, spent his life in closest association with Beethoven\r\nfrom his tenth year to his death,” he says too much; and too little\r\nwhen he writes that Beethoven “had once broken for a considerable\r\nspace with Breuning (and with what friend did he not?)” For besides\r\nthe quarrel, which Ries describes, there came at last so decided a\r\nseparation that Breuning’s name disappears from our history for a\r\nperiod of eight to ten years--and that, too, not from _his_ fault.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible that the two should have met in 1801 on such terms\r\nas those on which they had parted in 1796. Breuning had passed this\r\ninterval of five years in a small provincial town, Mergentheim,\r\nin the monotonous routine of a petty office, in the service of a\r\nsemi-military, semi-religious institution which had so sunk in grandeur\r\nand power as to be little more than a venerable name--a relic of the\r\npast. In the same service he had now returned to Vienna. How Beethoven\r\nhad been employed, and how he had risen, we have seen. Thus, their\r\nrelative positions in society had completely changed. Beethoven now\r\nmoved familiarly in circles to which Breuning could have access only by\r\nhis or some other friend’s protection.\r\n\r\nIn view of the relation in which Wegeler stood to the Breuning family,\r\nBeethoven might well have said more about “Steffen,” but not easily\r\nless. Even here something of patronizing condescension in the tone\r\nmakes itself felt, which becomes far too pronounced when he speaks of\r\nhim in the second letter--that of November. Reading these passages in\r\nconnection with those unlucky sentences in the Amenda letter, which\r\nhave been censured in another place, one feels that Breuning had been\r\nmade sensible, to a painful degree, how great his friend had grown.\r\nWegeler himself is struck by Breuning’s non-appearance at Beethoven’s\r\nprivate concert, and remarks: “He must have felt his disappointment\r\nwith this old friend all the more, since Breuning had been developed\r\nby Father Ries from an amateur to a most admirable violinist, and had\r\nseveral times played in electoral concerts.”\r\n\r\nThe more thoroughly the character of Breuning is examined, not only\r\nin his subsequent relations to Beethoven but also in the light of\r\nall that is known of him as a public official, as a husband, father\r\nand friend, the higher he stands as a man. Under circumstances, in\r\nhis office, fitted to try his patience beyond the ordinary limits of\r\nendurance, he never failed to bear himself nobly, as a man of high\r\nprinciple, ever ready to sacrifice private and personal considerations\r\nto the call of duty. In private life he was invariably just, generous,\r\ntenacious of the right. Whatever causes he may have had on divers\r\noccasions to complain of Beethoven, we learn nothing of them from his\r\ncorrespondence so far as it has been made public, unless a single\r\npassage cited by Wegeler be thought an exception; yet this is but\r\nthe expression of heartfelt sorrow and compassion--not one word of\r\nanger. And we know that Beethoven, when in distress, never turned\r\nto him in vain for sympathy nor for such aid as was in his power to\r\ngive. In the miserable years to come the reader will learn enough\r\nof Breuning, though by no means a prominent figure, to feel respect\r\nand admiration for his character, and to see for himself how unjust\r\nto him were those letters--written by Beethoven under the impulse of\r\nshort-lived choler--which Ries has contributed to the “Notizen.” There\r\nis some temptation to think that Breuning was of those whom Beethoven\r\n“estimated at only what they were worth to him”; but let us trust\r\nthat, should ever the blanks in the Amenda letter be filled from the\r\nautograph, his name will not be found--certainly not, if the conjecture\r\nas to the time of Amenda’s residence in Vienna prove correct. It is\r\ndifficult to avoid saying either too much or too little on such a\r\ntopic as this of Breuning and Beethoven--to strike the just medium in\r\nthe strength of the language used; but the subject has been made the\r\noccasion of so much injudicious comment, it was not possible to pass it\r\nover.\r\n\r\nVI. The “Intelligenz-Blatt” of Bonn, under date of November 30, 1784,\r\nannounces the baptism, on the preceding day, of Ferdinand, son of Franz\r\nRies.\r\n\r\n     Like many others who have become eminent musicians, his taste\r\n     and capabilities manifested themselves very early; as, at five\r\n     years old, he began his musical education under his father, and\r\n     afterwards under Bernhard Romberg, the celebrated violoncello\r\n     player.\r\n\r\nThe French invasion, the departure of Romberg in consequence (1794)\r\nfrom Bonn, and the pecuniary straits to which Franz Ries was reduced,\r\n\r\n     prevented much attention being, for some time, paid to the\r\n     instruction of his son.... At last, when he was about thirteen\r\n     (“he had reached the age of 13 years”, says the “Rheinischer\r\n     Antiquarius”), a friend of his father took him to Arnsberg\r\n     in Westphalia, for the purpose of learning thoroughbass and\r\n     composition from an organ-player in that neighborhood.... The\r\n     pupil proved so much the more able to teach of the two, that the\r\n     organist was obliged to give the matter up at once and proposed to\r\n     young Ries to teach him the violin instead. As a _pis-aller_, this\r\n     was accepted; and Ries remained at Arnsberg about nine months,\r\n     after which he returned home. Here he remained upwards of two\r\n     years, improving himself in his art with great industry.... At\r\n     length, in the year 1801, he went to Munich with the same friend\r\n     who had formerly taken him to Arnsberg. Here he was thrown upon\r\n     his own resources; and throughout the trying and dispiriting\r\n     circumstances which, with slight exception, attended the next\r\n     years of his life, he appears to have displayed a firmness, an\r\n     energy, and an independence of mind, the more honorable, perhaps,\r\n     from the very early age at which they were called into action. At\r\n     Munich, Mr. Ries was left by his friend, with little money and but\r\n     very slender prospects. He tried for some time to procure pupils,\r\n     but was at last reduced to copy music at three-pence per sheet.\r\n     With this scanty pittance, he not only continued to keep himself\r\n     free from embarrassments, but saved a few ducats to take him to\r\n     Vienna, where he had hopes of patronage and advancement from\r\n     Beethoven.... He set out from Munich with only seven ducats and\r\n     reached Vienna before they were exhausted!\r\n\r\nThe citations are from that noble musical journal the London\r\n“Harmonicon,” and belong to an article on Ries published in March,\r\n1824. They correspond perfectly to a sketch of Ries’s life in the\r\n“Rheinischer Antiquarius,” although there are sufficient differences to\r\nshow that the materials of the two articles were drawn from independent\r\nsources. The “Antiquarius” (Part III, Vol. II, p. 62), however, dates\r\nRies’s arrival in Munich 1800, the “Harmonicon” giving it 1801. But\r\nthe difference is rather apparent than real, since the winter of\r\n1800-1801 includes them both, and is therefore of very little import.\r\nBut when Ries, in the “Notizen” (p. 75), says: “On my arrival in\r\n_Vienna_ in 1800,” the discrepancy is one not to be passed over without\r\ninvestigation; not that it is a matter of much interest in itself\r\nwhen a boy of fifteen or sixteen years became a pupil of Beethoven,\r\nbut because of its bearing upon other and weightier questions in the\r\nchronology of the master’s life and works. Which, then, is correct?\r\n\r\nAyrton, the editor of the “Harmonicon,” could have obtained (in 1824)\r\nthe date for his article only from Ries himself, as in fact the\r\ninternal evidence proves him to have done. It was published after the\r\nannouncement of Ries’s farewell concert in London, with the evident\r\nintention of aiding in securing its success, and must have been\r\npresented to Ries for revision before it was sent to press. Ries,\r\ntherefore, must have erred by a lapse of memory, in 1824 as he admitted\r\nhe may have done, or in December, 1837, when he wrote the “Notizen.”\r\nAs for the writer, he has no hesitation in accepting September or\r\nOctober, 1801, as the date of Ries’s advent in Vienna. Thus the last\r\nof these errors--that of Wegeler in his date of the letter of June 29;\r\nthat of Schindler (in his first editions) in the date of the “Christus\r\nam Ölberg”; and this of Ries--which had thrown all this period of\r\nBeethoven’s history into a confusion that seemed inextricable, is\r\nsatisfactorily rectified, and the current of the narrative now flows as\r\nclear and unimpeded here as in any other part.\r\n\r\nLet us return to it. The “Harmonicon” proceeds:\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN AND FERDINAND RIES\r\n\r\n     Ries’ hopes from his father’s early friend, were not disappointed;\r\n     Beethoven received him with a cordial kindness, too rare, alas!\r\n     from men who have risen to eminence and distinction towards those\r\n     whose claim upon them is founded on the reminiscences of their\r\n     humble state. He at once took the young man under his immediate\r\n     care and tuition; advanced him pecuniary loans, which his\r\n     subsequent conduct converted to gifts; and allowed him to be the\r\n     first to take the title of pupil and appear in public as such.\r\n\r\nSo also the “Notizen”:\r\n\r\n     In the letter of recommendation from my father there had been\r\n     opened a small credit account to be used in case of need. I never\r\n     made use of it but, when a few times Beethoven discovered that\r\n     I was short of funds, he sent me money without being asked and\r\n     never wanted to take it back. He was really very fond of me, of\r\n     which fact he once in his absent-mindedness gave me a very comical\r\n     proof. Once when I returned from Silesia, where I had spent some\r\n     time at the country-seat of Prince Lichnowsky as pianist on the\r\n     recommendation of Beethoven, and entered his room he was about\r\n     to shave himself and had lathered his face up to his eyes--for\r\n     so far his fearfully stiff beard reached. He jumped up, embraced\r\n     me cordially and thereby transferred so much of the lather from\r\n     his left cheek to my right that he had none left. Did we laugh?\r\n     Beethoven must also have learned privately how matters had gone\r\n     with me; for he was acquainted with many of my youthful escapades,\r\n     with which he only teased me. In many cases he disclosed a really\r\n     paternal interest in me.\r\n\r\n“But with all his kindness” continues the “Harmonicon,”\r\n\r\n     Beethoven would not give Ries instruction in thoroughbass or\r\n     composition. He said it required a particular gift to explain them\r\n     with clearness and precision, and, besides that, Albrechtsberger\r\n     was the acknowledged master of all composers. This latter had\r\n     almost given up teaching, being very old, and was persuaded to\r\n     take a new pupil only by the strong recommendation of Beethoven\r\n     and by the temptation of a ducat a lesson. Poor Ries’ ducats ran\r\n     only to the number of 28; after this he was driven to his books\r\n     again.\r\n\r\nSo it appears that he was Beethoven’s pupil only upon the pianoforte.\r\nThe manner in which he was taught is also described in the “Notizen”:\r\n\r\nTHE RECOLLECTIONS OF RIES AND CZERNY\r\n\r\n     When Beethoven gave me a lesson I must say that contrary to his\r\n     nature he was particularly patient. I was compelled to attribute\r\n     this and his friendly disposition, which was seldom interrupted,\r\n     chiefly to his great affection and love for my father. Thus,\r\n     sometimes, he would permit me to repeat a thing ten times, or even\r\n     oftener. In the Variations dedicated to the Princess Odescalchi\r\n     (Op. 34), I was obliged to repeat the last _Adagio_ variations\r\n     almost entirely seventeen times; yet he was still dissatisfied\r\n     with the expression of the little cadenza, although I thought I\r\n     played it as well as he. On this day I had a lesson which lasted\r\n     nearly two hours. If I made a mistake in passages or missed notes\r\n     and leaps which he frequently wanted emphasized he seldom said\r\n     anything; but if I was faulty in expression, in _crescendos_,\r\n     etc., or in the character of the music, he grew angry because, as\r\n     he said, the former was accidental while the latter disclosed lack\r\n     of knowledge, feeling, or attentiveness. The former slips very\r\n     frequently happened to him even when he was playing in public.\r\n\r\n“I often played on two fortepianos with Ries,” says Czerny, “among\r\nother things the Sonata, Op. 47, which had been arranged for two\r\npianofortes. Ries played very fluently, clear but cold.”[119]\r\n\r\nHere we have a key to the identity of so many of Ries’s and Czerny’s\r\nfacts and anecdotes of those years, written out by them independently;\r\nthe latter, as he assures us, having first become acquainted with the\r\n“Notizen” through the quotations of Court Councillor Lenz. The two\r\nbrilliant boys, thrown so much together, would never weary of talking\r\nof their famous master. The stories of his oddities and eccentricities,\r\nminute facts relating to his compositions, were, therefore, common\r\nproperty; and it is clear that some which in this manner became\r\nknown to Ries at last assumed in his memory the aspect of personal\r\nexperiences and, as such, are related in the “Notizen.” The author\r\nof this work once introduced an incident into something that he was\r\nwriting, under the full conviction of having been an actor in it, which\r\nhe now knows was only related to him by his brother. Yet only some six\r\nor seven years had elapsed, whereas Ries wrote of a period which ended\r\nthirty-five years before.\r\n\r\nAnother remark of Czerny’s is as follows:\r\n\r\n     When the French were in Vienna for the first time, in 1805,\r\n     Beethoven visited a number of officers and generals who were\r\n     musical and for whom he played Gluck’s “Iphigenia in Tauris”\r\n     from the score, to which they sang the choruses and songs not at\r\n     all ill. I begged the score from him and at home wrote out the\r\n     pianoforte score as I had heard him play it. I still have this\r\n     arrangement (November, 1852). From that time I date my style of\r\n     arranging orchestral works, and he was always wholly satisfied\r\n     with my arrangements of his symphonies, etc.\r\n\r\nA lad who, though not yet fifteen years old, was able to write a\r\npianoforte score of such an opera after a single hearing, certainly\r\ndeserved the testimonial to his talent which, though written by another\r\nhand, was signed at the time by Beethoven and sealed. The testimonial,\r\nin the possession of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna, runs\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     We, the undersigned, cannot withhold from the lad Carl Czerny,\r\n     who has made such extraordinary progress on the pianoforte, far\r\n     surpassing what might be expected from a boy of fourteen years,\r\n     that for this reason, and also because of his marvelous memory, he\r\n     is deserving of all possible support, the more since his parents\r\n     have expended their fortune in the education of this promising son.\r\n\r\n    Vienna, December 7, 1805.\r\n\r\n    Ludwig van Beethoven. (Seal)\r\n\r\nThe master had early and wisely warned him against a too free use of\r\nhis extraordinary memory. “My musical memory,” Czerny writes,\r\n\r\n     enabled me to play the Beethovenian works by heart without\r\n     exception, and during the years 1801-1805 I was obliged to play\r\n     these works in this manner at Prince Lichnowsky’s once or twice\r\n     a week, he calling out only the desired opus number. Beethoven,\r\n     who was present a few times, was not pleased. “Even if he plays\r\n     correctly on the whole,” he remarked, “he will forget in this\r\n     manner the quick survey, the _a vista_-playing and, occasionally,\r\n     the correct expression.”\r\n\r\nVery neat is the anecdote which Czerny relates in the “Wiener\r\nMusikzeitung” of September 28th, 1845, how, after he had outgrown his\r\nstudies, he was deservedly reprimanded for a few additions which he\r\nmade on his own account in one of his master’s works.\r\n\r\n     On the whole he was pleased with my performance of his works ...\r\n     but he scolded me for every blunder with a kind freedom which I\r\n     shall never forget. When once, for instance, I played the Quintet\r\n     with Wind-Instruments with Schuppanzigh, I permitted myself, in\r\n     a spirit of youthful carelessness, many changes, in the way of\r\n     adding difficulties to the music, the use of the higher octave,\r\n     etc.--Beethoven took me severely to task in the presence of\r\n     Schuppanzigh, Linke and the other players. The next day I received\r\n     the following letter from him, which I copy carefully from the\r\n     original draft:\r\n\r\n       “Dear Czerny:\r\n\r\n       “To-day I cannot see you, but to-morrow I will call on you myself\r\n       to have a talk with you. I burst forth so yesterday that I was\r\n       sorry after it had happened; but you must pardon that in an\r\n       author who would have preferred to hear his work exactly as he\r\n       wrote it, no matter how beautifully you played in general. I will\r\n       make _loud_ amends at the Violoncello Sonata (I was to play his\r\n       Violoncello Sonata with Linke the next week). Be assured that as\r\n       an artist I have the greatest wishes for your success and will\r\n       always try to show myself,\r\n\r\n       Your\r\n       true Friend\r\n       Beethoven.”\r\n\r\n     This letter did more than anything else to cure me of the desire to\r\n     make any changes in the performance of his works, and I wish that\r\n     it might have the same influence on all pianists.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[109] Beethoven writes: “How can Amenda doubt that I should ever forget\r\nhim?”\r\n\r\n[110] We shall see that even Ries took no note of his friend’s\r\ninfirmity for two years.\r\n\r\n[111] Eleonore von Breuning, wife of Wegeler.\r\n\r\n[112] A well-known picture by Füger, Director of the Academy of\r\nPainting in Vienna.\r\n\r\n[113] Christoph von Breuning.\r\n\r\n[114] Breuning’s mother.

This change has been wrought by a _dear\r\nfascinating_ girl, etc.” Notwithstanding all that has been written on\r\nthis text there is little reason to think that Beethoven’s passion\r\nfor this particularly fascinating girl was more engrossing or lasting\r\nthan at other periods for others, although peculiar circumstances\r\nsubsequently kept it more alive in his memory. The testimony of\r\nWegeler, Breuning, Romberg, Ries, has been cited to the point that\r\nBeethoven “was never without a love, and generally deeply engrossed in\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n     In Vienna (says Wegeler) at least as long as I lived there,\r\n     Beethoven always had a love-affair on his hands, and occasionally\r\n     made conquests which, though not impossible, might have been\r\n     difficult of achievement to many an Adonis.... I will add that, so\r\n     far as I know, every one of his sweethearts belonged to the higher\r\n     social stations.\r\n\r\nSo, also, friends of Beethoven with whom Jahn conversed in 1852.\r\nThus according to Carl Czerny he was said to have been in love with\r\na Countess Keglevics, who was not generally considered handsome. The\r\nSonata in E-flat, Op. 7 (dedicated to her), was called “Die Verliebte”\r\n(“The Maiden, or Woman, in Love”). Dr. Bertolini, friend and physician\r\nof Beethoven from 1806 to 1816, said: “Beethoven generally had a flame;\r\nthe Countess Guicciardi, Mme. von Frank, Bettina Brentano and others.”\r\nHe was not insensible to ladies fair and frail. Doležalek, a music\r\nteacher who came to Vienna in 1800 and was the master’s admirer and\r\nfriend to the last, adds the particular that “he never showed that he\r\nwas in love.”\r\n\r\nIn short, Beethoven’s experience was precisely that of many an\r\nimpulsive man of genius, who for one cause or another never married and\r\ntherefore never knew the calm and quiet, but unchanging, affection of\r\nhappy conjugal life. One all-absorbing but temporary passion, lasting\r\nuntil its object is married to a more favored lover, is forgotten in\r\nanother destined to end in like manner, until, at length, all faith\r\nin the possibility (for them) of a permanent, constant attachment to\r\none person is lost. Such men after reaching middle age may marry for a\r\nhundred various motives of convenience, but rarely for love.\r\n\r\nUpon this particular passion of Beethoven, the present writer\r\nlabors under the disadvantage of being compelled to subordinate his\r\nimagination to his reason and to sacrifice flights of fancy to the duty\r\nof ascertaining and imparting the modicum of truth that underlies all\r\nthis branch of Beethoven literature, of extracting the few grains of\r\nwheat from the immense mass of chaff. With what success remains to be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nWhen Schindler, in perusing the “Notizen,” came to the passages above\r\nquoted, with his usual agility in jumping at conclusions he decided\r\nat once, that Beethoven here refers to the Countess Julia Guicciardi,\r\nand so states in his book; probably hitting the truth nearer than on\r\nthe next page, where he makes Fräulein Marie Koschak the object of\r\nBeethoven’s “autumnal love,” some half a dozen years before the two\r\nhad ever met. In this case, however, there is no reason to suppose him\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\nRELATIONS WITH THE COUNTESS GUICCIARDI\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of November, 1801--the date of Beethoven’s letter--the\r\nCountess Guicciardi was just one week less than seventeen years of age.\r\nShe is traditionally described as having had a good share of personal\r\nattractions, and is known to have been a fine looking woman even in\r\nadvanced years. She appears to have possessed a mind of fair powers,\r\ncultivated and accomplished to the degree then common to persons\r\nof her rank; but it is not known that she was in any way eminently\r\ndistinguished, unless for musical taste and skill as a pianist, which\r\nmay perhaps be indicated in the dedication to her of a sonata by\r\nKleinheinz as well as by Beethoven.\r\n\r\nJulia Guicciardi’s near relationship to the Brunswicks would naturally\r\nthrow her into the society of Beethoven immediately upon the transfer\r\nof her father from Trieste to Vienna; their admiration of his talents,\r\ntheir warm affection for him as a man, would awaken her curiosity to\r\nsee him and create a most natural prejudice in his favor. Coming to\r\nthe capital from a small, distant provincial town when hardly of an\r\nage to enter society, and finding herself so soon distinguished by the\r\nparticular attentions and evident admiration of a man of Beethoven’s\r\nsocial position and fame, might well dazzle the imagination of a\r\ngirl of sixteen, and dispose her, especially if she possessed more\r\nthan common musical taste and talents, to return in a certain degree\r\nthe affection proffered to her by the distinguished author of the\r\nSymphony, the Quartet, the Septet, the “Prometheus” music, and so many\r\nwonderful sonatas, by the unrivalled pianist, the generous, impulsive,\r\nenthusiastic artist, although unprepossessing in person and unable\r\nto offer either wealth or a title. There was romance in the affair.\r\nBesides these considerations there are traditions and reminiscences\r\nof old friends of the composer all tending to confirm the opinion of\r\nSchindler, that the “fascinating girl” was indeed the young Countess\r\nGuicciardi. That writer, however, knew nothing of the matter until\r\ntwenty years afterwards; but what he learned came from Beethoven\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIt happened, when the topic came up between them, “that, being in a\r\npublic place where he did not like to trust himself to speak,” says\r\nSchindler, Beethoven also wrote his share in the conversation, so far\r\nas it related to this subject; hence his words may still be read in a\r\nConversation Book of February, 1823, preserved in the Royal Library at\r\nBerlin. His statements have certainly gained nothing in clearness from\r\nhis whim of writing them in part in bad French.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to state, before introducing the citation from this book,\r\nthat the young lady married Count Wenzel Robert Gallenberg, a prolific\r\ncomposer of ballet and occasional music, on the 3rd of November, 1803.\r\nThe young pair soon left Vienna for Italy and were in Naples in the\r\nspring of 1806; for Gallenberg was one of the composers of the music\r\nfor the fêtes, on the occasion of Joseph Bonaparte’s assumption of the\r\ncrown of the Two Sicilies. When the Neapolitan Barbaja took charge of\r\nthe R. I. Opera at Vienna, toward the close of 1821, he made the Count\r\nan associate in the administration, and thus it happened that Schindler\r\nhad occasion to call upon him with a message from Beethoven.\r\n\r\nThe Conversation Books of those years show, that the question of\r\nselling the opera, “Fidelio,” to various theatres, was one often\r\ndiscussed by Beethoven and his friends, and, also, that the author had\r\nno complete copy of the score. It thus became necessary to borrow one\r\nfor the purpose of copying the whole or parts; and at this point we\r\nturn to the Conversation Book. Schindler, in the midst of a long series\r\nof remarks upon heterogeneous topics, expresses surprise that the\r\nDresden theatre has never purchased “Fidelio,” and adds his opinion,\r\nthat Weber will do all in his power to further Beethoven’s interest,\r\nboth in regard to the opera and to the Mass in D. Then follows\r\npolitical news--Spain, England, etc.--and the sale or hypothecation\r\nby Dr. Bach of certain bank shares on which Beethoven wishes to raise\r\nmoney; and then:\r\n\r\nA CONVERSATION ABOUT THE COUNTESS\r\n\r\n     _Schindler_: Now as to “Fidelio”; what shall, what can I do to\r\n     expedite that?\r\n\r\n     _Beethoven_: Steiner has the score.\r\n\r\n     _Schindler_: I shall go to Count Gallenberg, who will lend it to\r\n     you for a time with pleasure. It would be best if you were to\r\n     have it copied at your own expense. You may ask 40 ducats. (After\r\n     a farther remark or two he promises to see Gallenberg “to-morrow\r\n     morning”; some pages farther is the report):\r\n\r\n     _Schindler_: Gallenberg presents his compliments; he will send the\r\n     score, provided they have two copies. If this is not the case he\r\n     will have the score copied for you. I am to call on him again in\r\n     two days. (The conversation then turns upon copying certain songs\r\n     and upon lithographing the Mass in D; after which):\r\n\r\n     _Schindler_: He (Gallenberg) did not inspire me with much respect\r\n     to-day.\r\n\r\n     _Beethoven_: I was his invisible benefactor through others.\r\n\r\n     _Schindler_: He ought to know that, so that he might have more\r\n     respect for you than he seems to have. (Kitchen affairs follow\r\n     here for a space; then Beethoven takes the pencil and writes):\r\n\r\n     _Beethoven_: So it seems you did not find G. favorably disposed\r\n     toward me; I am little concerned in the matter, but I should like\r\n     to know what he said.\r\n\r\n     _Schindler_: He replied to me that he thought that you must have\r\n     the score yourself; but when I assured him that you did not have\r\n     it he said that its loss was a consequence of your irregular\r\n     habits and many changes of lodgings. What affair is that of the\r\n     public? And, moreover, who will care what such persons think? What\r\n     have you decided to do in the matter at Steiner’s? To keep quiet\r\n     still longer? Dr. Bach recently asked me about it. I thought you\r\n     wanted to keep the score because you had none. Do you want to\r\n     give the five-part fugue also for nothing? My dearest friend and\r\n     master, that is too much generosity towards such unworthy persons.\r\n     You will only be laughed at. (Steiner had bought some compositions\r\n     of B. and not published them.)\r\n\r\n     _Beethoven_: (having asked Schindler if he had seen Gallenberg’s\r\n     wife, proceeds): _J’étois bien aimé d’elle et plus que jamais son\r\n     époux. Il étoit pourtant plutôt son amant que moi, mais par elle\r\n     j’apprenois de son misère et je trouvais un homme de bien, qui me\r\n     donnait la somme de 500 fl. pour le soulager. Il étoit toujours\r\n     mon ennemi, c’étoit justement la raison, que je fusse tout le bien\r\n     que possible._\r\n\r\n     _Schindler_: It was for this reason that he added “He is an\r\n     intolerable fellow.” Probably because of pure gratitude. But\r\n     forgive them, Lord, they know not what they do. _Est-ce qu’il y a\r\n     longtemps qu’elle est mariée avec Mons. de Gallenberg?--Mad. la\r\n     Comtesse? Était-elle riche? Elle a une belle figure jusqu’ici!_\r\n\r\n     _Beethoven_: _Elle est née Guicciardi. Elle étoit l’épouse de lui\r\n     avant son voyage en Italie--arrivé à Vienne elle cherchoit moi\r\n     pleurant, mais je la méprisois._[121]\r\n\r\n     _Schindler_: Hercules at the crossways!\r\n\r\n     _Beethoven_: And if I had wished to give my vital powers with that\r\n     life, what would have remained for the nobler, the better (things)?\r\n\r\nReverence for the composer, and admiration for his compositions, must\r\nhave led many who will read this to the perusal of the constantly\r\naccumulating literature of which Beethoven and his works are the\r\nsubject; and they must remember the prominence accorded to the\r\nGuicciardi affair. Will they believe that all the _established_\r\nfacts, which have ever been made public, are exhausted in these pages\r\nalready? This is literally true. All else is but conjecture or mistake.\r\nThere is nothing in the present state of knowledge on this subject to\r\nrelieve the great mass of turgid eloquence expended upon it from being\r\ndescribed in one word as--nonsense. The foundation for a tragedy is\r\ncertainly small in a case where the lover writes: “It is the first time\r\nthat I feel as if marriage _might_ make me happy”; and immediately adds\r\n“now, of course, I could not marry!” because the gratification of his\r\nambition was more to him than domestic life with the beloved one.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1852, Jahn had an interview with the Countess Gallenberg.\r\nOn so delicate a topic as Beethoven’s passion for her fifty years\r\nbefore, reticence was natural; but had the affair in truth been of the\r\nimportance that others have given it, some hint must have confessed it.\r\nYet there is nothing of the kind in his notes of the conversation. Here\r\nthey are:\r\n\r\n     Beethoven was her teacher; he had his music sent to her and was\r\n     extremely severe until the correct interpretation was reached\r\n     down to the smallest detail; he laid stress upon a light manner\r\n     of playing; he easily became angry, threw down his music and tore\r\n     it; he would take no pay but linen, although he was very poor,\r\n     under the pretence that the Countess had sewed it. He also taught\r\n     Princess Odescalchi and Baroness Erdmann; sometimes he went to\r\n     his pupils, sometimes they came to him. He did not like to play\r\n     his own compositions, but would only improvise. At the slightest\r\n     disturbance he would get up and go away. Count Brunswick, who\r\n     played the violoncello, adored him as did (also) his sisters,\r\n     Therese and Countess Deym. Beethoven had given her (the Countess\r\n     Guicciardi) the Rondo in G, but begged its return when he had to\r\n     dedicate something to the Countess Lichnowsky, and then dedicated\r\n     the Sonata to her. B. was very ugly, but noble, refined in feeling\r\n     and cultured.\r\n\r\nIn this simple record the lady’s memory evidently mistakes by\r\noverrating the poverty of Beethoven at the time she was his pupil\r\nand in making him then so negligent in dress. “In his earlier years\r\nBeethoven dressed carefully, even elegantly; only later did he grow\r\nnegligent, which he carried to the verge of uncleanliness,” says\r\nGrillparzer; and Czerny: “About the year 1813-’14, when B. looked well\r\nand strong, he also cared for his outward appearance.” But what a blow\r\nto all the supposed romantic significance is the short, prosaic account\r\nof the dedication of the C-sharp minor Sonata to her--a composition\r\nwhich was not a favorite with the composer himself. “Everybody is\r\nalways talking about the C-sharp minor Sonata! Surely I have written\r\nbetter things. There is the Sonata in F-sharp major--that is something\r\nvery different,” he once said to Czerny.\r\n\r\nA CONJECTURAL OFFER OF MARRIAGE\r\n\r\nThere is but one well-authenticated fact to be added, namely, that\r\nBeethoven kept up his intercourse with the family Guicciardi certainly\r\nas late as May or June, 1823, that is, to within six months of the\r\nyoung lady’s marriage. A careful survey and comparison both of the\r\npublished data and of the private traditions and hints gleaned during\r\na residence of several years at Vienna, result in the opinion (an\r\nopinion, note, not a statement resting on competent evidence) that\r\nBeethoven at length decided to offer Countess Julia his hand; that\r\nshe was not indisposed to accept it; and that one of her parents\r\nconsented to the match, but the other, probably the father, refused to\r\nentrust the happiness of his daughter to a man without rank, fortune\r\nor permanent engagement; a man, too, of character and temperament so\r\npeculiar, and afflicted with the incipient stages of an infirmity\r\nwhich, if not arrested and cured, must deprive him of all hope of\r\nobtaining any high and remunerative official appointment and at length\r\ncompel him to abandon his career as the great pianoforte virtuoso. As\r\nthe Guicciardis themselves were not wealthy, prudence forbade such a\r\nmarriage. Be all this as it may, this much is certain: Beethoven did\r\nnot marry the Countess Julia Guicciardi; Count Wenzel Robert Gallenberg\r\ndid. The rejected lover--true to a principle enunciated in a letter\r\nto Zmeskall of March 29, 1799, “there is no use in quarrelling with\r\nwhat cannot be changed”--made the best of it, and went to work on the\r\n“Sinfonia eroica”!\r\n\r\nSCHINDLER’S UNFOUNDED CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nEvery reader acquainted with Schindler’s book will have noticed that\r\ntwo grave matters, connected by him with the Guicciardi affair, have\r\nbeen silently passed over, notwithstanding the very great importance\r\ngiven to them by him and his copyists. They must now be considered.\r\nSchindler’s honest and conscientious desire to ascertain and impart the\r\ntruth concerning Beethoven admits no doubt. The spirit was willing,\r\nbut his weakness as an investigator was something extraordinary. His\r\nhelplessness in finding and following the clue out of a difficulty is\r\nsomething pitiable, sometimes ludicrous. He reminds us, now and then,\r\nof the character described by Addison: “He is perpetually puzzled and\r\nperplexed amidst his own blunders.”\r\n\r\nTake the present matter for an instance. In his first editions of\r\nthe biography the date given to the Guicciardi affair is 1806. With\r\nWegeler’s letter before him giving him one fixed point--November,\r\n1801--and the “Gräfliches Taschenbuch” to be consulted in every\r\nrespectable bookstore and public library for the day of Gallenberg’s\r\nmarriage, November 3, 1803, he is still at a loss. “I had first to come\r\nto Paris, there make the acquaintance of Cherubini, in order to hit,\r\nquite accidentally, upon a certain clue for this date for which I had\r\nvainly searched in Vienna. Cherubini and his wife, soon after their\r\narrival in Vienna in 1805, heard of this affair as of something that\r\nhad happened two years before.” Following this hint, in his edition\r\nof 1860, he changes the 1806 to 1803--that is, he adopts the new date\r\nbecause, twenty years before, he heard from an old gentleman of 80\r\nyears and his wife, nearly as old, that, thirty-five years before,\r\nthey had heard that some two years before that time Beethoven had\r\nbeen jilted! They also “could say with certainty that the effect upon\r\nBeethoven’s mood had already been overcome”;--which we are very willing\r\nto hear from them, although the fact needed no confirmation. Again;\r\nhis conversation with Beethoven, given as an appendix to the edition\r\nof 1845, was suppressed in the first because the Countess Gallenberg\r\nwas then living; the “Taschenbuch” would have taught him that this\r\nobjection remained in force until March 22nd, 1856! How is it possible\r\nto read with confidence the opinions and statements of so helpless\r\na writer--even when we grant him, as we do Schindler, the utmost\r\nrectitude of intention--except when he speaks from personal knowledge,\r\nor upon evidence which he shows to be good?\r\n\r\nHaving in a manner so extraordinary fixed the date to his satisfaction,\r\nSchindler proceeds to the catastrophe:\r\n\r\n     Yet touching the results of this break upon the spirits of our\r\n     master, so highly blessed by this love, something more may be\r\n     said. In his despair he sought comfort with his approved and\r\n     particularly respected friend Countess Marie Erdödy--at her\r\n     country-seat at Jedlersee, in order to spend a few days in\r\n     her company. Thence, however, he disappeared and the Countess\r\n     thought he had returned to Vienna, when, three days later, her\r\n     music-master, Brauchle, discovered him in a distant part of the\r\n     palace gardens. This incident was long kept a close secret, and\r\n     only after several years did those familiar with it confide it to\r\n     the more intimate friends of Beethoven, long after the love-affair\r\n     had been forgotten. It was associated with a suspicion that it\r\n     had been the purpose of the unhappy man to starve himself to\r\n     death. Those friends who made close observation of the attitude\r\n     of Beethoven towards the music-master noticed that he treated him\r\n     with extraordinary attention thereafter.\r\n\r\nJedlersee is so near Vienna, that a stout walker like Beethoven would\r\nthink nothing of the distance; and for _him_ to obey the whim or\r\nnecessity of the moment, and disappear for two or three days, is the\r\nvery weakest of all grounds for the astounding conjecture here gravely\r\nrelated. But grant for a moment that something of the kind, some time\r\nor other, really occurred; what reason is there to suppose that it\r\nhappened then, and in connection with the Guicciardi matter? None,\r\n_Credat Judæus Apella, non ego_. Indeed the whole story, whatever its\r\ndate and connection, is told on such mere hearsay evidence as would not\r\njustify the police in arresting a beggar. To prevent it from passing\r\ninto the category of established facts--at least in connection with\r\nthis particular love-affair, and until some new and competent proof be\r\ndiscovered--it may be remarked:\r\n\r\nI. Schindler’s first knowledge of the passion of Beethoven for Julia\r\nGuicciardi was obtained in 1823. Whatever he heard from other sources\r\ncould only have been afterwards; and in all probability was after\r\nBeethoven’s death, when his attention was recalled to the subject by a\r\npaper presently to be noticed. He does not pretend to have heard this\r\nJedlersee story from any party to it; nor could he, for the Countess\r\nErdödy had been banished from the Austrian dominions long before it\r\ncould have come to his ears. He is, in fact and upon his own showing,\r\ngravely detailing a mere private rumor, current (he says) among certain\r\nfriends of Beethoven, of an event which happened (if at all) fifteen,\r\ntwenty or thirty years before, and which was _surmised_ by them, or by\r\nhim, to have occurred at the time he was jilted by the young Countess\r\nGuicciardi.\r\n\r\nII. There is nothing whatever in Ries’s reminiscences, most of which\r\nare of the precise period of that affair, which, by any stretch of\r\nfancy, can be made to confirm the story; nay, more, they are utterly\r\ninconsistent with it. There is nothing even to show that he ever\r\nobserved that his master’s relations to the Guicciardis were in any way\r\nremarkable; yet Beethoven’s inclination to the society of women was a\r\npoint in his character that particularly impressed him. “Beethoven,” he\r\nsays,\r\n\r\n     was fond of the company of women, especially if they had young and\r\n     pretty faces, and generally when we passed a somewhat charming\r\n     girl he would turn back and gaze at her through his glasses\r\n     keenly, and laugh or grin if he noticed that I was looking at him.\r\n     He was frequently in love, but generally only for a short period.\r\n     Once when I twitted him concerning his conquest of a pretty woman\r\n     he admitted that she had held him in the strongest bonds for the\r\n     longest time, viz., fully seven months.\r\n\r\nIII. And so too with Breuning. There is no letter, or part of a letter\r\nby him (so far as made known by Wegeler), nor any tradition derived\r\nfrom him, that relates to this passion or its supposed consequences;\r\nand yet, it is only from one of his letters that we know of the\r\nproposal of marriage in 1810; nay, more, we shall find, in 1803,\r\nBeethoven inviting a friend to dine with “Countess Guicciardi,” at a\r\ntime when he and Breuning lodged together!\r\n\r\nIV. If the Jedlersee story be true at all in connection with this\r\nparticular lady, the time must have been 1803. But it is totally\r\ninconsistent with what is known of the composer’s history during that\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nV. Brauchle was not the Countess Erdödy’s music-teacher, but the tutor\r\nof her children, in which capacity he could hardly have been employed\r\nat a time when the eldest was not six years of age! If we are correctly\r\ninformed, he was not in that service until after the year 1803; nor\r\nis it known that Beethoven’s intimacy with the Countess had then been\r\nformed. In any case, the starvation story may be considered as disposed\r\nof for the present.\r\n\r\nThe force of these arguments will be incidentally but materially\r\nincreased by the views--if they find favor and acceptance--advanced\r\nand supported in a short discussion of the single remaining question\r\nbelonging to the Guicciardi affair, to which we now come.\r\n\r\nIt was well known to Beethoven’s friends, that he died possessed of\r\na few bank-shares; but where the certificates were deposited neither\r\nhis brother, Breuning nor Schindler knew. “B. kept his bank-shares in\r\na secret drawer of a cabinet known only to Holz,” is one of Jahn’s\r\nnotes of a conversation with Carl Holz. When Schindler read Jahn’s\r\nmanuscript notices and memoranda upon Beethoven and added his comments,\r\nhe remarked here:\r\n\r\n     Johann Beethoven first devoted himself to the disappearance of\r\n     the shares, and not finding them he cried out: “Breuning and\r\n     Schindler must find them.” Holz was asked to come, by Breuning,\r\n     and requested to say if he did not know where they were concealed.\r\n     He knew the secret drawer in the old cabinet in which they were\r\n     kept.\r\n\r\nIn that “secret drawer” Breuning found not only the bank-certificates,\r\nbut also various “letters of importance to his friend,” as Schindler\r\ndescribes them. One of these was a letter with two postscripts written\r\nby Beethoven on two pieces of note-paper with a lead pencil, at some\r\nwatering-place not named, in the July of a year not given and to a\r\nperson not indicated. It is couched in terms of enthusiastic love\r\nrarely equalled even in romance, being like a translation into words\r\nof the most tender and touching passages in his most impassioned\r\nmusical compositions. This document, placed in Schindler’s possession\r\nby Breuning, is the original of what was first printed in 1840, as,\r\n“three autograph letters written by Beethoven to his Giulietta from a\r\nbathing-place in Hungary”[122] and which have so often been reprinted\r\nat various times. The letter is as follows:\r\n\r\nTEXT OF THE LETTER TO THE “IMMORTAL BELOVED”\r\n\r\n    July 6, in the morning.\r\n\r\n     My angel, my all, my very self--only a few words to-day and\r\n     at that with pencil (with yours)--not till to-morrow will my\r\n     lodgings be definitively determined upon--what a useless waste of\r\n     time. Why this deep sorrow where necessity speaks--can our love\r\n     endure except through sacrifices--except through not demanding\r\n     everything--can you change it that you are not wholly mine, I not\r\n     wholly thine. Oh, God! look out into the beauties of nature and\r\n     comfort yourself with that which must be--love demands everything\r\n     and that very justly--_thus it is with me so far as you are\r\n     concerned, and you with me_. If we were wholly united you would\r\n     feel the pain of it as little as I. My journey was a fearful one;\r\n     I did not reach here until 4 o’clock yesterday morning; lacking\r\n     horses the post-coach chose another route--but what an awful\r\n     one. At the stage before the last I was warned not to travel at\r\n     night--made fearful of a forest, but that only made me the more\r\n     eager and I was wrong; the coach must needs break down on the\r\n     wretched road, a bottomless mud road--without such postilions\r\n     as I had with me I should have stuck in the road. Esterhazy,\r\n     travelling the usual road hitherward, had the same fate with eight\r\n     horses that I had with four--yet I got some pleasure out of it,\r\n     as I always do when I successfully overcome difficulties. Now a\r\n     quick change to things internal from things external. We shall\r\n     soon surely see each other; moreover, I cannot communicate to you\r\n     the observations I have made during the last few days touching\r\n     my own life--if our hearts were always close together I would\r\n     make none of the kind. My heart is full of many things to say to\r\n     you--Ah!--there are moments when I feel that speech is nothing\r\n     after all--cheer up--remain my true, my only treasure, my all as I\r\n     am yours; the gods must send us the rest that which shall be best\r\n     for us.\r\n\r\n    Your faithful Ludwig.\r\n\r\n    Evening, Monday, July 6.\r\n\r\n     You are suffering, my dearest creature--only now have I learned\r\n     that letters must be posted very early in the morning. Mondays,\r\n     Thursdays,--the only days on which the mail-coach goes from here\r\n     to K. You are suffering--Ah! wherever I am there you are also. I\r\n     shall arrange affairs between us so that I shall live and live\r\n     with you, what a life!!!! thus!!!! thus without you--pursued by\r\n     the goodness of mankind hither and thither--which I as little\r\n     try to deserve as I deserve it. Humility of man towards man--it\r\n     pains me--and when I consider myself in connection with the\r\n     universe, what am I and what is he whom we call the greatest--and\r\n     yet--herein lies the divine in man. I weep when I reflect that you\r\n     will probably not receive the first intelligence from me until\r\n     Saturday--much as you love me, I love you more--but do not ever\r\n     conceal your thoughts from me--good-night--as I am taking the\r\n     baths I must go to bed. Oh, God! so near so far! Is our love not\r\n     truly a celestial edifice--firm as Heaven’s vault.\r\n\r\n    Good-morning, on July 7.\r\n\r\n     Though still in bed my thoughts go out to you, my Immortal\r\n     Beloved, now and then joyfully, then sadly, waiting to learn\r\n     whether or not fate will hear us. I can live only wholly with you\r\n     or not at all--yes, I am resolved to wander so long away from you\r\n     until I can fly to your arms and say that I am really at home,\r\n     send my soul enwrapped in you into the land of spirits.--Yes,\r\n     unhappily it must be so--you will be the more resolved since\r\n     you know my fidelity--to you, no one can ever again possess my\r\n     heart--none--never--Oh, God, why is it necessary to part from\r\n     one whom one so loves and yet my life in W (Vienna) is now a\r\n     wretched life--your love makes me at once the happiest and the\r\n     unhappiest of men--at my age I need a steady, quiet life--can that\r\n     be under our conditions? My angel, I have just been told that the\r\n     mail-coach goes every day--and I must close at once so that you\r\n     may receive the L. at once. Be calm, only by a calm consideration\r\n     of our existence can we achieve our purpose to live together--be\r\n     calm--love me--to-day--yesterday--what tearful longings for\r\n     you--you--you--my life--my all--farewell--Oh continue to love\r\n     me--never misjudge the most faithful heart of your beloved L.\r\n\r\n    ever thine\r\n    ever mine\r\n    ever for each other.\r\n\r\nAmong the many persons before whom at various times Schindler kindly\r\nplaced the original for examination were Otto Jahn and the present\r\nwriter, neither of whom ever discovered any other reason to suppose\r\nthis paper to have been intended for the Countess Guicciardi than\r\nSchindler’s conjecture and the grounds upon which he had formed it.\r\nBearing in mind that the existence of this paper was utterly unknown to\r\neither Breuning or Schindler until after the death of its writer, who\r\nalone could have imparted its history, the mental process by which it\r\ncame to be described in the words just quoted, “three autograph letters\r\nwritten by Beethoven to his Giulietta from a bathing-place in Hungary,”\r\nis perfectly easy to trace; thus:\r\n\r\nIn the first of the three parts, or letters, Beethoven speaks of the\r\nvery disagreeable journey which he had performed with four post-horses,\r\nand Esterhazy with eight; in the second he writes of the “mail-coach\r\nfrom here to K.” and again, “As I am taking the baths I must go to\r\nbed.” Now, of the 218 places in the Austrian postal-guide whose names\r\nbegin with K, a large number are in Hungary; the bathing-places in that\r\nkingdom are also numerous; and Esterhazy’s possessions were there;\r\nhence Schindler’s assumption that Beethoven wrote from a Hungarian\r\nwatering-place--which may stand for the present. His conjecture as to\r\nwhom he wrote was of course suggested by his conversation in 1823 upon\r\nthe Countess Gallenberg. This assumption, so obvious and natural for\r\nhim to make that it was accepted unquestioned and even unsuspected for\r\nthirty years, must nevertheless be tested.\r\n\r\nWHEN WAS THE LOVE-LETTER WRITTEN?\r\n\r\nThe document presents three incomplete dates, the year being omitted in\r\neach:\r\n\r\n    “July 6, in the morning.”\r\n    “Evening, Monday, July 6.”\r\n    “Good-morning on July 7.”\r\n\r\nA reference to the almanacs of 1795, 1801, 1807, and 1812, shows that\r\nJuly 6th fell upon a Monday in those years. The year 1795 is of course\r\nexcluded, for Julia Guicciardi had not then completed her eleventh\r\nyear, and we turn at once to 1801. The main subjects of Beethoven’s\r\nletter to Wegeler of June 29th were his ailments and the modes of\r\ntreatment adopted by his medical advisers; to which he adds his desire\r\nfor his friend’s counsel, Wegeler being a physician of eminent ability\r\nand skill. It was Wegeler’s reply which drew forth the second letter\r\nof November 16, only four and a half months after the first, which\r\ncontinues the subject with equal minuteness of detail. If now the\r\nreader will turn back and carefully reperuse the two, he will see that\r\nall possibility of a journey to some distant watering-place, requiring\r\nthe use of four post-horses, whether in Hungary or elsewhere, in\r\nthe interval between those letters is absolutely excluded by their\r\ncontents. The conclusion is unavoidable that the diary was not written\r\nin 1801.\r\n\r\nBut may there not be an error either in the day of the month or of the\r\nweek in the words: “Evening, Monday, July 6?” If there be, the inquiry\r\nis extended to the years 1800 and 1802.\r\n\r\nOn July 6th, 1800, the Guicciardi family had hardly reached Vienna\r\nfrom Trieste. But suppose Julia had been previously sent thither to\r\ncomplete her education, and thus had become known to Beethoven. In that\r\ncase, what is to be thought of guardians and friends who could allow\r\nher such liberty, or rather license, that she, at the age of fifteen\r\nand three-quarter years, should already have formed the relations\r\nnecessarily implied by the language of the diary with a man twice her\r\nage? What, too, must be thought of Beethoven! Granting him to have\r\nbeen, as Magdalena Willmann and others said, “half crazy,” the man\r\ncertainly was not a fool!\r\n\r\nThe year 1800 may also be safely discarded. As to 1802, it is\r\nsuperfluous to say more than that in the next chapter will be found\r\npart of a letter by Beethoven, dated “Vienna, July 13, 1802.” His stay\r\nat the bath must, indeed, have been short if he reached it with four\r\npost-horses on the 5th and is in Vienna again writing letters on the\r\n13th!\r\n\r\nIn 1803, July 6th fell upon Wednesday. But there was no such error\r\nin the date; Beethoven gives the day of the month three times in\r\ntwenty-four hours--twice on the 6th, once on the 7th. A mistake here\r\nis inconceivable. The day of the week, indeed, is written but once;\r\nbut then it is Monday, and Sunday and Monday are precisely the two\r\ndays of the week which one most rarely or never mistakes. But that\r\npart of the document which bears the date “Evening, Monday, July 6”\r\ncontains certain words that are decisive. This part is a postscript\r\nto the writing of the morning and is written, he says, because he was\r\ntoo late for the post on that day, and “Mondays, Thursdays, the only\r\ndays on which the mail-coach goes from here to K.” The conclusion is\r\nirresistible: Schindler and his copyists are all wrong; the document\r\nwas not written in the years 1800-1803; the “Immortal Beloved” for whom\r\nit was written was _not_ the Countess Julia Guicciardi. Therefore, they\r\nwho have wept in sympathy over this Werther’s sufferings caused by\r\nthis Charlotte, may dry their tears. They can comfort themselves with\r\nthe assurance, that the catastrophe was by no means so disastrous as\r\nrepresented. The affair was but an episode; not the grand tragedy of\r\nBeethoven’s life. But, being a love adventure, it has been treated with\r\nfact in ratio to fancy like Falstaff’s bread to his sack. One author\r\nin particular, who accepts all Schindler’s assumptions and conjectures\r\nwithout question or suspicion, has elaborated the topic at great\r\nlength, though perhaps (to borrow Sheridan’s jest) less luminously than\r\nvoluminously. Having wrought up the feelings of “his lovely readers,\r\nhis dear lady friends of Beethoven,” to the highest pitch possible\r\nin a tragedy where the hero, after the catastrophe, still lives and\r\nprospers, he consoles them a few chapters farther on by giving to\r\nBeethoven for his one “Love’s Labor Lost” two new ones gained--the\r\none, a married woman, the other, a young girl of fourteen years; and,\r\nmoreover--if, in the confusion of his dates, the reader is not greatly\r\nmisled--both at the same time! “Also the Lord gave Job twice as much\r\nas he had before,” saith the ancient Hebrew poet.[123]\r\n\r\nEven if one were disposed to attach no great importance to the\r\narguments thus far advanced, there are two passages in the letter which\r\ncould not have been written in that brilliant period of Beethoven’s\r\nlife (1800-1802) and therefore are conclusive; viz.: “My life in W\r\n(Wien = Vienna) is now a wretched life,” and “At my age I need a quiet,\r\nsteady life.” In fact, the severest critical discussion of my argument\r\nagainst the accuracy of Schindler’s statement has failed to find a flaw\r\nin it beyond the unessential assertion that Beethoven could scarcely be\r\nconceived as having erred in the matter of the day of the week. Since\r\nthen the author has himself accidentally learned by experience how a\r\nmistake of this kind, made in the morning, can easily be perpetuated in\r\nprivate letters; he learned it by being compelled to prove the absolute\r\naccuracy of an official document.\r\n\r\nEvery attentive and thoughtful reader of the letter must realize that\r\nit is irreconcilable with the notion that Beethoven’s passionate\r\ndevotion to the lady was a new and sudden one; also that Beethoven had\r\nparted with his beloved, whoever she may have been, only a short time\r\nbefore; that he writes in the full conviction that his love is returned\r\nand the desire for a union of their fates was mutual, and that by\r\npatient waiting the obstacles then in the way of their purpose to live\r\ntogether would be overcome.\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN’S INACCURATE DATINGS\r\n\r\nIn the effort to determine when Beethoven wrote in this strain his own\r\ninaccurate dates cannot be overlooked, but must be discussed at the\r\noutset of the inquiry. If the words “Evening, Monday, July 6,” are to\r\nbe considered conclusive, the investigation will have to be confined to\r\nthe years 1807 and 1812, both 1801 and 1818 being out of the question.\r\nBut if an error of a day be assumed, inquiry may be extended to the\r\nfollowing years. In the first three years\r\n\r\n                                  1805       1807       1808\r\n    the 5th of July fell on a   Saturday   Sunday     Tuesday\r\n    the 6th of July on a        Sunday     Monday     Wednesday\r\n    the 7th of July on a        Monday     Tuesday    Thursday\r\n\r\nIn the three later years\r\n\r\n                                  1811       1812       1813\r\n    July 5th fell on a          Friday     Saturday   Monday\r\n    July 6th on a               Saturday   Monday     Tuesday\r\n    July 7th on a               Sunday     Tuesday    Wednesday\r\n\r\nTo pass by other reasons, the years 1808 and 1811 are to be excluded\r\nbecause they presuppose an error of two days. There remain, then, the\r\nyears 1806, 1807, 1812 and 1813, which can be best studied in their\r\nreverse order. The year 1813 shows itself at once impossible because of\r\nthe date of a letter to Varena: “Baden, July 4, 1813,” besides other\r\ncircumstances which prove that Beethoven spent the months of June and\r\nJuly of this year in Vienna and Baden. In a similar manner 1812 must be\r\nrejected because he wrote a letter to Baumeister on June 28 from Vienna\r\nand arrived in Teplitz on July 7.\r\n\r\nThere remain, then, only the years 1806 and 1807. If we are willing to\r\nattach too great weight to the improbability of an error in Beethoven’s\r\ndates (July 6 and 7) it would certainly be impossible to decide in\r\nfavor of the year for which other considerations plead with almost\r\nconvincing force--viz., 1806. There is a letter from Beethoven to\r\nBrunswick proposing to visit him in Pesth _printed_ with the date “May\r\n14, 1806” which might be strong evidence in favor of that year; but,\r\nunfortunately, the true date is 1807, and so adds to our difficulty.\r\nFor it is known that on July 22nd, 1807 (and for several days at least\r\nbefore), he was in Baden, and there is nothing thus far to prove that\r\nhe did not make the proposed visit and return from Hungary in season\r\nto have written the love-letter on the 6th and 7th of that month; this\r\nis, it is true, a very unsatisfactory assumption. There is a date in\r\na correspondence with Simrock touching the purchase of certain works,\r\nwhich, if it could be established with certainty, would remove all\r\ndoubt and provide a satisfactory conclusion. If the correspondence\r\ntook place in 1806 it would be impossible to avoid the unsatisfactory\r\nassumption.\r\n\r\nThe head of the famous house of Simrock once told the author that the\r\nletters written to his father by Beethoven had been stolen (they have\r\nsince been recovered), and that the only possible information on the\r\npoint might be obtained from the old business books of the house. The\r\nauthor asked that they be examined for him and his request was most\r\ncourteously complied with, with the result that he was provided with\r\nthe excerpts from the letters of which he has made use in a later\r\nchapter. To his great satisfaction the most important of the letters\r\nbears date May 31, 1807. This and the letter following show that\r\nBeethoven spent the months of June and July 1807 in Baden.\r\n\r\nThe result would, then, seem to be irrefutable:--there is an error of\r\none day in Beethoven’s date. The letter was written in the summer which\r\nhe spent partly in Hungary, partly in Silesia--_the summer of 1806_.\r\nIn all the years from 1800 to 1815 there is no other summer in which\r\nhe might have written the letter within the first ten days of July\r\nunless we choose to assume a state of facts which would do violence to\r\nprobability.\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN’S MORAL CHARACTER VINDICATED\r\n\r\nBut our contention has a much more serious purpose than the\r\ndetermination of the date of a love-letter; it is to serve as the\r\nfoundation for a highly necessary justification of Beethoven’s\r\ncharacter at this period in his life. The editor of Beethoven’s\r\nletters to Gleichenstein which appeared in “Westermann’s Monatsheften”\r\n(1865)[124] learned from Gleichenstein’s widow that the composer had\r\nonce made a proposal of marriage to her sister Therese Malfatti. On the\r\nstrength of this information, and certain references in the letters\r\nthemselves, the editor founded a singular theory;--Beethoven, says the\r\neditor in question, fell in love with “the dark-brown Therese,” who,\r\ndespite the fact that she was “then only 14 years old (in 1807), was\r\nfully developed.” “His love for her was as rapid in its growth as it\r\nwas in its passionateness, but _was not returned then or later_.” “The\r\naffair was plainly embarrassing to the family, for the passion of the\r\nhalf-deaf, very eccentric man of 36 for a girl of fourteen could not\r\nfail in the long run to become dangerous (_misslich_).”\r\n\r\n“Why, very well; I hope here be truths,” as the _Fool_ says in “Measure\r\nfor Measure.”\r\n\r\nReflect that this was the year of the Mass in C and the C minor\r\nSymphony, and imagine the picture: Beethoven, the mighty master,\r\noccupied in developing works which stirred the deepest depths of\r\nthe soul. Such on one hand; on the other “the lover, sighing like a\r\nfurnace, with a woeful ballad made to his mistress’ eyebrow.” Or, if\r\none prefer, instead of the first picture, a half-deaf, eccentric,\r\n36-year old Corydon, wandering about by the side of mossy brooks vainly\r\npiping tunes to a melancholy early-developed and early-loved Phyllis!\r\nLet us admit for the nonce that the amiable picture of Beethoven in\r\n1807 is the correct one; there is yet no excess of reason based on\r\nsense or probability, no boundlessness of imagination or immature logic\r\nwhich can assert that the letter of July 6 and 7 was written to Therese\r\nMalfatti, then 13 years old.\r\n\r\nThere is still another assumption or suspicion which must be touched\r\nupon here and if possible refuted; it is that, even in 1806,\r\nBeethoven’s letter was addressed to the Countess Guicciardi, then\r\nalready the wife of Count Gallenberg. Moreover, a more natural\r\nsolution of the difficulties could scarcely be found if it could but be\r\nproved or accepted as true that the composer was one of those exalted\r\nmusical geniuses, recently lauded by a writer, who are “no longer\r\nsubject to once accepted notions of morals and ordinary duties,” and\r\nwho refuse to permit “narrow-minded ethics to be lifted to the real\r\nlaws of existence.” If Beethoven had been a man of this character,\r\nwhat more should we need to believe that in the summer of 1806 he and\r\nthe lady were impatiently awaiting the moment when they might steal\r\naway from husband and children and thus attain “their purpose to live\r\ntogether,” heart closely pressed to heart? Here a single objection will\r\nsuffice: Count Gallenberg and his wife had at this time long been in\r\nNaples. No! This disgrace does not attach to the name of Beethoven.\r\n\r\nThose who have thought it worth while to follow the discussion thus far\r\nwill now understand why so much time and labor were spent on removing\r\nall doubt as to the dates of the letters of June 29, 1801, and July 6\r\nand 7, 1806, and this after a long time had passed during which there\r\nhad never arisen a doubt in the mind of the writer. For if these dates\r\nremain fixed, the extended romantic structures which have been reared\r\non the sandy foundation of conjecture must fall in ruins.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions reached by the study seem as natural as they are\r\nsatisfactory and indubitable. Young Beethoven, possessed of a\r\ntemperament susceptible and excitable in the highest degree and endowed\r\nnot only with extraordinary genius but, leaving out of consideration\r\nhis physical misfortunes, with other attractive qualities--the\r\ngreat pianist, the beloved teacher, the highly promising composer,\r\nadmired and accepted gladly in the highest circles of society of the\r\nmetropolis--this Beethoven, as Wegeler expresses it, was always in love\r\nand generally in the highest degree. As he took on years, however, his\r\npassions cooled, and it is a truth of daily observation that at the\r\nlast a strong and lasting attachment can obtain mastery over the most\r\nvacillating and fickle lover. According to our conviction this was also\r\nthe case with Beethoven, and most assuredly the famous love-letter\r\nwas addressed to the object of a wise and honorable love which had\r\ntaken control over him. If this be true, and if he was so violently\r\nin love in 1806, it follows that the references in the Gleichenstein\r\ncorrespondence which their editor applies to a “completely developed\r\ngirl of fourteen years of age,” in 1807, were aimed at an entirely\r\ndifferent individual; and this, too, is the conviction of the author.\r\n\r\nBut who is the lady? it is asked.[125] The secret was too well guarded;\r\nand she is still unknown. This, only, is certain: that\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTESS THERESE VON BRUNSWICK\r\n\r\n1st. Of all Beethoven’s friends and acquaintances of the other sex\r\nwhose names are on record one only could have been the “Immortal\r\nBeloved” of the letter and the party to this project of marriage; 2nd,\r\nall the circumstantial evidence points to her and to her only; 3rd,\r\nlong after these two points were determined, Robert Volkmann, the fine\r\nmusician and composer, in conversation with the author, mentioned\r\na local tradition at Pesth which directly names her as having been\r\nonce the beloved and even (if our memory serve) the bride _in spe_ of\r\nBeethoven. This lady was the Countess Therese von Brunswick.\r\n\r\nThe scattered notices of the Brunswicks in these volumes, if taken\r\nconnectedly, may appear of deeper significance than has been suspected.\r\nThey were of the earliest and warmest friends of Beethoven in Vienna;\r\nthey “adored him,” said their cousin, the Countess Gallenberg;\r\nBeethoven wrote the song “Ich denke dein” in the album of the sisters\r\nand dedicated it to them when he published it in 1805; he received\r\nfrom Therese her portrait in oil;[126] visited the Brunswicks in the\r\nautumn of 1806 and composed the Sonata, Op. 57, which he dedicated to\r\nthe brother; and immediately after his departure wrote the passionate\r\nlove-letter,--to whom?--wrote to Count Franz, “Kiss your sister\r\nTherese,” and in the autumn of 1809, while on another visit to them,\r\ncomposed the Sonata, Op. 78, dedicated to the sister. A few months\r\nlater the marriage project fell through.\r\n\r\nTwo remarks may be noted here which, if of no great importance, are\r\nworth the space they will occupy: 1st. After the appearance of the\r\ndedication of Op. 78, Therese von Brunswick’s name disappears from\r\nall papers, notes and memoranda concerning Beethoven collected by\r\nJahn or the author; yet the friendship between him and the brother\r\nremained undisturbed. 2nd. This friendship of thirty years’ duration\r\nwas broken only by death; yet, although in the later years long periods\r\nof separation were frequent, their known epistolary correspondence is\r\ncomprised in some half dozen letters, and the half of these with false\r\ndates. Were these all? If not, why should all, except just these which\r\nare neither of particular interest nor importance, have been destroyed\r\nor concealed? Unless, indeed, there was a secret to be preserved.\r\nTherese von Brunswick lived to a great age, having the reputation of a\r\nnoble and generous but eccentric character. In regard to Beethoven, so\r\nfar as is known, she, like Shakespeare’s _Cardinal_, “died and made no\r\nsign.” Because she could not?[127]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(Postscript by the Editor of the English Edition.)\r\n\r\nThere are other candidates than the Countesses Guicciardi and Brunswick\r\nfor the honor of having been the object of what, it must be admitted,\r\nwas Beethoven’s supreme love;--or, at least, there are other women\r\nfor whom writers have put in pleas. Though Dr. Kalischer professed to\r\nbelieve that he had effectually disposed of the Thayer hypothesis,\r\nit is significant that by far the most notable champions who fought\r\nfor their respective lady-loves are those who entered the lists\r\nfor the Countess Therese. I mention only the American Thayer; the\r\nEnglishman Grove; the Germans La Mara, Storck, and Prelinger (like\r\nKalischer, the editor of a collection of Beethoven’s letters); the\r\nFrenchmen Rolland and Chantavoine, both biographers of Beethoven.\r\nSchindler, Nohl and Kalischer carried the sleeve of the Countess\r\nGuicciardi; Frimmel and Volbach seemed gently inclined to Magdalena\r\nWillmann, the actress who said that Beethoven wanted to marry her but\r\nshe would not have him because he was so ugly and “half crazy”; Dr.\r\nWolfgang A. Thomas-San-Galli is the champion of Amalia Sebald as the\r\n“Immortal Beloved” and of 1812 as the year in which the love-letter was\r\nwritten. Of his book (“Die Unsterbliche Geliebte Beethovens, Amalia\r\nSebald,” Halle, 1909) it may be said that its merit lies in its close,\r\npertinent and dispassionate reasoning--the quality in which all of Dr.\r\nKalischer’s arguments are most deficient.\r\n\r\nDR. KALISCHER’S DEFENCE OF SCHINDLER\r\n\r\nSchindler’s story touching the letter and Giulietta Guicciardi was\r\nunquestioned for thirty years, when doubt was cast upon it by Thayer’s\r\ninvestigations, which fixed the date as 1806 and thereby eliminated\r\nthe Countess as the composer’s inamorata. In Vol. II, Thayer contented\r\nhimself with a demonstration that the Countess could not be the\r\n“Immortal Beloved.” In Vol. III, in the body of the book, he suggested\r\nthat in “greatest probability” the lady was the Countess Therese von\r\nBrunswick. It does not appear that he ever went further than this, but\r\nhe died, in 1897, in full conviction that by no possibility could the\r\nGuicciardi be rehabilitated in the place she had so long occupied in\r\nthe minds of historians and romancers. His first contribution to the\r\nquestion (the first portion of this chapter) immediately called forth a\r\ndefence of Schindler’s story, Dr. Alfred Christian Kalischer being in\r\nthe van of Schindler’s defenders. Instead of traversing the evidence\r\nin the case as Thayer had done, Kalischer proposed and followed the\r\n“inductive method” thus: Beethoven could not have indulged in such\r\ntransports at as late a date as 1806 or 1807. They were the outpourings\r\nof a sentimentalist, one of the Werther sort. Beethoven had said in the\r\nletter that he could only live wholly with his love or not at all--an\r\nexpression not to be thought of in connection with a genius who had\r\ncreated the “Eroica” symphony, “Fidelio,” the Sonatas in D minor and F\r\nminor (Op. 57), the Pianoforte Concertos in C minor and G major, the\r\nQuartets, Op. 59, had finished the fourth Symphony and sketched the\r\nC minor and the “Pastoral”--could such a genius believe for a moment\r\nthat he could not live without the object of his love? etc. The whole\r\nargument was merely rhetoric and psychologically speculative.\r\n\r\nIn a criticism of Thayer’s third volume, written for “Der\r\nClavierlehrer” in 1879, Kalischer took up the subject of Therese\r\nBrunswick and, pursuing his old style of argumentation, urged that the\r\n“Immortal Beloved” was Giulietta and not Therese because, forsooth,\r\nBeethoven had dedicated the C-sharp minor Sonata to the former and\r\nnothing better than the Sonata in F-sharp major, Op. 78, composed in\r\n1809, to the latter. Kalischer saw no force in the fact that sketches\r\nfor the so-called “Moonlight” Sonata antedated the dedication by\r\na considerable period; the essential things in his mind were the\r\ndedication and that Lenz thought highly of the C-sharp minor and little\r\nof the Fantasia for Pianoforte, Op. 77, dedicated by Beethoven “to\r\nhis friend” Brunswick, and still less of the F-sharp Sonata dedicated\r\nto “another member of the house of Brunswick”; and that while Marx\r\nhad described the C-sharp minor Sonata as “the low hymn of love’s\r\nrenunciation” he did not consider the F-sharp major Sonata as worthy\r\neven of mention.\r\n\r\nThese essays, together with another in which Dr. Kalischer performed\r\nwith great energy the work of disposing of the romantic vaporings of\r\na writer who called herself Mariam Tenger, who had published a book\r\n(“Beethoven’s Unsterbliche Geliebte, nach persönlichen Erinnerungen”)\r\nat Bonn in 1890, in which she affected to prove what Thayer had set\r\ndown as merely a probability. This writer (who had most obviously\r\ntaken her cue from Thayer, though she protested that she had not read\r\nhis biography when she wrote her book) professed to have had the tale\r\nfrom the lips of the Countess Brunswick herself, that Beethoven, while\r\nvisiting at Martonvásár, the country-seat of the Brunswicks, in May,\r\n1806, had become secretly engaged to the Countess, no one else knowing\r\nthe fact except Beethoven’s friend Count Franz von Brunswick. Dr.\r\nKalischer found little difficulty in demolishing a large portion of\r\nthe fantastic fabric reared by Mariam Tenger, especially that portion\r\nwhich professed to rest upon the alleged testimony of a “Baron Spaun”\r\nwho was plainly a creation of the romancer’s, though a veritable Spaun\r\ndid figure, largely and creditably, in the life-history of Schubert.\r\nNot content with this the critic went further, and reviewing the\r\nsentimental career of Beethoven from 1806 to 1810 (in which latter year\r\nit is supposed the relations between him and the Countess Brunswick\r\ncame to an end), he protested that, in 1807, Beethoven was in love with\r\nTherese Malfatti, then a girl of 14 years.\r\n\r\nLA MARA AND THE COUNTESS THERESE\r\n\r\nThat question had already been discussed by Thayer, as we have seen.\r\nSo also had the identity of Baron Spaun by Marie Lipsius, known in\r\nmusical literature by her pen-name La Mara, who called attention\r\nto inaccuracies in the Tenger story in the first of a collection\r\nof essays entitled “Classisches und Romantisches aus der Tonwelt,”\r\npublished in Leipsic in 1891. The same author who, in all her\r\nwritings on the subject, has stoutly maintained the correctness of\r\nThayer’s theory, made the most valuable contribution yet offered to\r\nthe controversy by her book, “Beethoven’s Unsterbliche Geliebte. Das\r\nGeheimniss der Gräfin Brunsvick und ihre Memoiren,” published by\r\nBreitkopf and Härtel in 1909. To this book it is necessary to pay\r\nrather extended attention; but before its contents are passed in review\r\nit deserves to be noted that Thayer, who followed the multitude of\r\narguments for and against his hypothesis with the greatest interest and\r\nwith a characteristically open mind, went down to his grave with his\r\nstrong conviction unshaken that “in greatest probability” the Countess\r\nTherese was the “Immortal Beloved.” To La Mara he sent a letter dated\r\nJanuary 22, 1892, to which attention was called in a foot-note on the\r\nhistory of the C-sharp minor Sonata in an earlier chapter of this work,\r\nand which, through the courtesy of the lady to whom it was addressed,\r\nis now given in substance:\r\n\r\n     ... That Mr. Kalischer has adopted Ludwig Nohl’s strange notion\r\n     of Beethoven’s infatuation for Therese Malfatti, a girl of\r\n     _fourteen years_, surprises me; as also that he seems to consider\r\n     the Cis moll Sonata to be a musical love poem addressed to Julia\r\n     Guicciardi. He ought certainly to know that the subject of that\r\n     Sonata was, or rather that it was suggested by, Seume’s little\r\n     poem “Die Beterin.”\r\n\r\n     I pray you to stop here and read before proceeding the first\r\n     part of the _Liebesbrief_. Note well that it was written from a\r\n     _Badeort_ so far away from Vienna that he journeyed thither in a\r\n     coach with four horses and Esterhazy with eight. And now to the\r\n     essential points.\r\n\r\n     During the summer of 1801, we know that Beethoven lodged in\r\n     Hetzendorf--where ex-Kurfürst Franz resided and died July 26, that\r\n     year--and composed his “Christus am Ölberg” in great part in the\r\n     near Schönbrunn garden. We know that he wrote on June 29, a very\r\n     full account of his increasing deafness to Dr. Wegeler. Was he,\r\n     only seven days later, in a distant _Badeort_, writing _such_ a\r\n     love-letter to a young _Gräfin_ not yet seventeen years old? In\r\n     November he again wrote to Wegeler. “Du willst wissen,” he says,\r\n     “wie es mir geht, was ich brauche,” and proceeds to describe his\r\n     physician’s treatment. In neither of these letters is there the\r\n     remotest hint that the doctor sent him to a distant _Badeort_. In\r\n     1802, Beethoven’s summer lodging was in Heiligenstadt where young\r\n     Ries came often to receive his master’s instructions. There is\r\n     not the slightest intimation from him, nor anywhere else, of any\r\n     absence of Beethoven during that summer. Did Beethoven write the\r\n     _Liebesbriefe_ in July and the so-called Testament--that document\r\n     of despair--in October? Observe these dates. In the _Liebesbriefe_\r\n     from the _Badeort_ July 6: “Ich kam erst Morgens 4 Uhr gestern\r\n     hier an.” Seven days later, July 13, he was in Vienna writing to\r\n     Breitkopf and Härtel!\r\n\r\n     In the Testament we read: “Dieses halbe Jahr was ich auf dem Lande\r\n     zubrachte,” but in no known letter or writing of Beethoven’s of\r\n     that summer is there any reference to the distant _Badeort_.\r\n\r\n     All that is known of Beethoven in the summer of 1801 and 1802, is\r\n     against the journey to the _Badeort_; what is known of the summer\r\n     of 1806 is for it. The burden of proof lies upon Mr. Kalischer.\r\n     When he _can_ prove such a journey in 1801 or 1802, and does so,\r\n     it will be _one_ point in his favor.\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF FRIENDS AND RELATIONS\r\n\r\nThe method pursued by La Mara in her investigation, which extended\r\nover several years, was much like that of Thayer: in every case in\r\nwhich it seemed that testimony might be had from the mouths of living\r\npersons she sought to obtain it. First she visited the Countess Marie\r\nBrunswick (or Brunsvik, as the Hungarian branch of the Braunschweigers,\r\nor Brunswicks, spelled the name), daughter of Count Franz. There was\r\nan interview followed by a correspondence. The Countess said that\r\nthe family knew nothing whatever of the alleged romantic attachment\r\nbetween her aunt and Beethoven. She recalled that Beethoven had a\r\n“grosse Schwärmerei” for her father’s cousin, the Countess Guicciardi,\r\nafterwards Gallenberg, but the feeling was not reciprocated on the\r\npart of the Countess so far as had been learned. The family was still\r\nin possession of three or four letters from Beethoven to her father.\r\nIn November, 1899, she sent four letters to La Mara which were then\r\nowned by her brother, Count Géza Brunswick. Three of these letters\r\nhad already been printed in the first edition of this biography.\r\nThe only one bearing on the subject of this study was that in which\r\nBeethoven begs the Count to kiss his sister Therese. (This letter La\r\nMara presents in _facsimile_ in her book.) Count Gallenberg (son of\r\nthe Countess Giulietta and the last of the family) had died in Vienna\r\nin 1893, two years after he had denied that there had been any talk\r\nof marriage or _mutual_ love between his mother and Beethoven. The\r\ntestimony of two grand-children of the Countess Giulietta was asked.\r\n“Beethoven wanted to marry grandmamma,” said the Countess Bertha\r\nKuenburg, _née_ Countess Stolberg-Stolberg, in Salzburg, “but she loved\r\nGallenberg.” Baroness Hess-Diller, _née_ Countess Gallenberg, in Baden\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     Among our family papers there is absolutely nothing bearing on the\r\n     matter--_no_ letters, _no_ diary. The prejudices of the period,\r\n     the incredible point of view held by persons of our station\r\n     towards artists, even towards artists of Beethoven’s greatness,\r\n     may have been responsible for the fact that no interest was felt\r\n     in the matter. All that verbal tradition has brought down to me is\r\n     summed up in the one circumstance that Beethoven figured only as a\r\n     music-teacher in the house of my great-grand-parents.\r\n\r\nOn the suggestion of the grand-children of the Countess Giulietta, La\r\nMara called on Fräulein Karoline Languider, a life-long friend of the\r\nGallenbergs, who had lived with them and the Countess Marie Brunswick.\r\nThis witness testified:\r\n\r\n     I do not believe that the _Schwärmerei_ for Countess Julia\r\n     Gallenberg-Guicciardi--though it may have been warm and wonderful,\r\n     for she was a very beautiful, elegant woman of the world--ever\r\n     took such possession of the heart of Beethoven as did the later\r\n     love for Countess Therese Brunsvick, which led to an engagement.\r\n     That was decidedly his profoundest love, and that it did not\r\n     result in marriage, it is said, was due to the--what shall I\r\n     call it?--real artistic temperament (_Natur_) of Beethoven,\r\n     who, in spite of his great love, could not make up his mind to\r\n     get married. It is said that Countess Therese took it greatly\r\n     to heart. Having lived during my childhood with my parents in\r\n     Pressburg, I often heard--with childish ears, of course--persons\r\n     speak about the matter, and am able to remember that Countess\r\n     Therese was greatly beloved, and that my mother was always very\r\n     glad when she came to Pressburg, which was every year.\r\n\r\nLa Mara having sent Fräulein Languider some of her writings and a copy\r\nof Lampi’s portrait of the Countess Therese, she wrote on January 24,\r\n1901: “After all that has been said _pro_ and _contra_ I remain of\r\nthe unalterable opinion that the Countess Therese was the ‘Immortal\r\nBeloved’ and fiancée of the great master, concerning which fact I heard\r\ninnumerable conversations in my childhood, and that the portrait is\r\nhers. Countess Marie does not see a resemblance, but I do not trust\r\nher memory.” Countess Marie Brunswick had said to La Mara that she did\r\nnot consider the painting which is now preserved in the Beethovenhaus\r\nin Bonn a portrait of her aunt; “but,” says La Mara, “since there was\r\na difference of 57 years, she could no longer judge of a likeness with\r\nthe youthful picture.”\r\n\r\nCount Géza Brunswick, son of Beethoven’s friend, died in the spring of\r\n1902, having outlived his sister Marie. The direct line of Brunswicks\r\nreached its end in him. The castles Korompa and Martonvásár passed\r\ninto other hands. Count Franz’s art collection was sold at auction\r\nin Vienna, but the widow of Count Géza retained possession of the\r\nBeethoven relics (the letters and an oil portrait) and took them\r\nwith her to Florence, where subsequently she married the Marchese\r\nCapponi. She, too, gave her testimony: “It is certain that there were\r\nsoul-relationships between Beethoven and Therese Brunsvik.”\r\n\r\nNext, La Mara went to Pressburg (in search of such traditions as\r\nThayer had found in Pesth), working on the hint thrown out by Fräulein\r\nLanguider. In Pressburg she met Johann Batka, municipal archivist,\r\nwho bore testimony to the fact that a relative of the Countess Therese\r\nBrunswick, who was in possession of her memoirs (a copy, evidently,\r\nsince La Mara obtained the original from the family of Count Deym), had\r\npersuaded him to believe that Therese was the “Immortal Beloved” and\r\nsecret fiancée of Beethoven. After La Mara had published the results\r\nof her investigation in the January number for 1908 of the “Neue\r\nRundschau,” the grand-niece of Countess Therese, Isabella, Countess\r\nDeym, and her sister Madame Ilka Melichar, confirmed the statement\r\nthat the letter had been addressed to their illustrious grand-aunt. An\r\nestrangement had sprung up between Count Franz and his sister Therese\r\nafter his marriage; but the intimacy between the sisters Therese and\r\nJosephine, Countess Deym, had continued, and the romance, never known\r\nto the families of Count Franz and his sister Countess Teleky, had come\r\ndown as a tradition in the family of Count Deym.\r\n\r\nThe rest of La Mara’s book is filled with the memoirs of Therese\r\nBrunswick, which she began writing in September, 1846, and called “My\r\nHalf-Century.” In introducing the interesting document, La Mara thought\r\nherself compelled to abandon Thayer’s contention that the love-letter\r\nhad been written in 1806, and substituted 1807 (a date urged also by\r\nLadislaw Jachinecki, in an article published in the “Zeitschrift der\r\nInternationalen Musikgesellschaft” for July and August, 1908), on the\r\nground that 1806 had become untenable, 1807 agreed with the almanac\r\nand that Beethoven’s sojourn at Baden in the summer of 1807 did not\r\npreclude a visit to Hungary of three weeks’ duration between the end\r\nof June and July 26. La Mara was persuaded to make the change by her\r\ndiscovery in the memoirs of the fact that on July 5, 1806, Countess\r\nTherese was in Transylvania visiting her sister Charlotte, Countess\r\nTeleky, and was present when the latter gave birth to a daughter,\r\nBlanca, on that date. Having assumed, with Thayer, that Beethoven wrote\r\nthe love-letter very soon after a visit to the Brunswicks at Korompa\r\n(which is her reading of the mysterious “K” in the letter), and sent\r\nit from a neighboring watering-place, convinced that Therese was with\r\nher sister on July 6, 1806, she adopted the theory that the letter was\r\nwritten in 1807, in which year the much-discussed 6th of July fell on a\r\nMonday. She also alludes to other evidence which she does not describe\r\nbut by which she doubtless means a letter by Beethoven to Breitkopf\r\nand Härtel dated “Vienna, July 5, 1806,” which became known to the\r\ninvestigators when the well-known publishers of Leipsic made a private\r\npublication of the letters from the composer found in their archives.\r\nThis was after the death of Mr. Thayer. Touching this letter and the\r\nsignificance of Beethoven’s “K” the writer of this note submits,\r\nwithout argument, a few suggestions:\r\n\r\nNEW SUGGESTIONS CONCERNING THE LETTER\r\n\r\n1. There is nothing in the letter, beyond what might be called its\r\natmosphere, to indicate that Beethoven had recently visited the object\r\nof his love. The words “To-day--yesterday--what tearful longings for\r\nyou,” to which such an interpretation might be given, plainly refer\r\nonly to his mood and his thoughts on the two days when the letter was\r\nin his mind; they tell us nothing about the distance or time which lay\r\nbetween him and his “ferne Geliebte.”\r\n\r\n2. It is plain that Beethoven and Prince Esterhazy started from the\r\nsame place for the Hungarian watering-place whence the letter was sent\r\n(if it ever was sent), Beethoven travelling by an unusual route because\r\nof a lack of horses, the Prince by the usual route. It is anything but\r\nlikely that this place was Martonvásár; it is much more probable that\r\nit was one of Esterhazy’s country-seats.\r\n\r\n3. There is no indication in the letter or anywhere else how long\r\nBeethoven was _en route_, but the journey extended over several stages,\r\nfor “at the stage before the last” he was warned not to travel at\r\nnight, etc. He may have been as far in the interior of Hungary as a\r\npost-coach could carry him in, let us say, two days.\r\n\r\n4. We know nothing about the rapidity of travel over Hungarian roads\r\na century ago, but we do know that as early as 1635, i. e., 171 years\r\nbefore Beethoven made the journey, an English post was established\r\nwhich made the trip from London to Edinburgh and back in six days; and\r\nEdinburgh is 357 miles from London by road. The English mail-coach,\r\ntherefore travelled an average of 119 miles in 24 hours. At even half\r\nof this speed Beethoven might have been comparatively near the place in\r\nwhich Countess Therese spent June and July, 1806.\r\n\r\n5. This place was not Korompa, but may have been Klausenburg or Kolosz,\r\nthe principal town of Transylvania, where Count Teleky lived. This is\r\nat least remotely possible.\r\n\r\n6. It is but natural to assume that the post between the important\r\nplaces of Hungary and the metropolis of Transylvania ran fairly often\r\nand at fair speed, and if Beethoven expected that a letter which he\r\nthought would be detained at the place where it was posted till early\r\non Thursday morning would not reach its destination till Saturday, that\r\ndestination must have been at a considerable distance (a two days’\r\nrun) from the watering-place. “So near, so far!” has little value as\r\nevidence; it is an ecstatic commonplace concerning the unattainable, or\r\nthat which seems to be so.\r\n\r\n7. The fact that the Countess Therese was not at Korompa in the early\r\npart of July, 1806, is not in itself a sufficient reason for abandoning\r\nthat date; she was at Klausenburg. The letter to Breitkopf and Härtel,\r\nthough plainly dated “Vienna, July 5, 1806” (Kalischer, No. 109), might\r\neasily be disposed of as convincing evidence against 1806, if it did\r\nnot bear the publishers’ endorsement apparently indicating that it\r\nhad either been received or answered on July 11 of the year. Nothing\r\ncould make Beethoven’s carelessness in respect of dates plainer than\r\nthe next letter of Beethoven’s in which he replied to the letter which\r\nBreitkopf and Härtel had sent him in answer to the proposition which he\r\nhad made in the letter dated July 5, 1806. The second letter is dated\r\n“Grätz, am 3ten Heu-Monat,” (i.e., Hay month, otherwise July); yet it\r\nrefers to the earlier letter and was written at Troppau in Austrian\r\nSilesia, where Beethoven spent the fall of 1806 as the guest of Prince\r\nLichnowsky. Breitkopf and Härtel’s endorsement shows that the letter\r\nwas received and answered in September. There is some significance,\r\ntoo, in the fact that Beethoven refers to his journey from Vienna to\r\nTroppau, which must have been nearly 200 miles long, as a short one\r\n(“Etwas viel zu thun und die _kleine Reise_ hierher,” etc.). (See\r\nKalischer, Letter No. 110.) Beethoven may have written the letter\r\nin Vienna on one of the first two days of July, or even the last of\r\nJune, making one of his characteristic blunders in the dating, and yet\r\nhave been deep in Hungary on the dubious date on which he wrote the\r\nlove-letter. The endorsement of Breitkopf and Härtel, “July 5, 1806,”\r\ncould not have been anything more than a transcript of the date found\r\non the letter.\r\n\r\nThe editor is well aware that his suggestions do not clear up the\r\nmystery; he offers them nevertheless for what they are now or may\r\nhereafter be worth. The references to Beethoven in the Memoirs of\r\nTherese Brunswick made public by La Mara are to be found in the\r\nfollowing excerpts:\r\n\r\nTHE MEMOIRS OF THERESE VON BRUNSWICK\r\n\r\n     During the extraordinary sojourn of 18 days in Vienna my mother\r\n     desired that her two daughters, Therese and Josephine, receive\r\n     Beethoven’s invaluable instruction in music. Adalbert Rosti, a\r\n     schoolmate of my brother’s, assured us that Beethoven would not\r\n     be persuaded to accept a mere invitation; but if Her Excellency\r\n     were willing to climb the three flights of winding stairs of the\r\n     house in St. Peter’s Place, and make him a visit, he would vouch\r\n     for a successful outcome of the mission. It was done. Like a\r\n     schoolgirl, with Beethoven’s Sonatas for Violin and Violoncello\r\n     and Pianoforte under my arm, we entered. The immortal, dear Louis\r\n     van Beethoven was very friendly and as polite as he could be.\r\n     After a few phrases _de part et d’autre_, he sat me down at his\r\n     pianoforte, which was out of tune, and I began at once to sing the\r\n     violin and the ’cello parts and played right well. This delighted\r\n     him so much that he promised to come every day to the Hotel zum\r\n     Erzherzog Carl--then Goldenen Greifen. It was May in the last\r\n     year of the last century. He came regularly, but instead of an\r\n     hour frequently staid from 12 to 4 or 5 o’clock, and never grew\r\n     weary of holding down and bending my fingers, which I had been\r\n     taught to lift high and hold straight. The noble man must have\r\n     been satisfied, for he never missed a single day in the 16....\r\n     It was then that the most intimate and cordial friendship was\r\n     closely established with Beethoven, a friendship which lasted to\r\n     the end of his life. He came to Ofen; he came to Martonvásár; he\r\n     was initiated into our social republic of chosen people. A round\r\n     spot was planted with high, noble lindens; each tree had the name\r\n     of a member, and even in their sorrowful absence we conversed with\r\n     their symbols, and were entertained and instructed by them. Often\r\n     after giving the good-morning greeting I asked the tree concerning\r\n     this and the other thing which I desired to have explained, and it\r\n     never failed to answer me.\r\n\r\nLater, speaking of the loss of caste and poverty of her brother-in-law\r\nCount Deym (who had changed his name to Müller because of a duel fought\r\nbefore he had attained his majority, and conducted an art museum, and\r\nwho after his marriage to Therese’s sister Josephine tried in vain\r\nto take the position in society to which his rank entitled him), the\r\nCountess writes:\r\n\r\n     The aristocracy turned its back on him because he had gone into\r\n     business. He could not hunt up his former rich acquaintances.\r\n     Beethoven was the faithful visitor at the house of the young\r\n     Countess--he gave her lessons gratis and to be tolerated one\r\n     had to be a Beethoven. The numerous relatives, the sisters of\r\n     her father and their children, frequently visited their amiable\r\n     niece. Tableaux were occasionally given; Deym, being himself an\r\n     artist, was at home in such matters, they gave him pleasure....\r\n     There were musical soirées. My brother came in vacation-time and\r\n     made the acquaintance of Beethoven. The two musical geniuses\r\n     became intimately associated with each other, and my brother never\r\n     deserted his friend in his frequent financial troubles until his,\r\n     alas! too early death.\r\n\r\n     It was about this time (1814) that Baron C. P. came very often to\r\n     Martonvásár. He was fond of my brother and wanted to learn the\r\n     science of agriculture from him and his men. We played chess with\r\n     each other; he conceived a passion for me and tried to embrace\r\n     me. From that moment onward he frequently repeated his offers\r\n     and waited two years for my assent--for I always answered that I\r\n     should have to ponder the matter and had had no time to do so.\r\n     I had remained cold, an earlier passion had devoured my heart.\r\n     Josephine needed me, her children, who were very promising, loved\r\n     me and I them--how could I withdraw myself from such a magic\r\n     circle? When I was active with the Women’s Association after the\r\n     great famine of 1819, we met on the street. I was in a carriage\r\n     and had the coachman stop at a signal from him. He came to the\r\n     carriage and said significantly, “Have you pondered, dear Therese?\r\n     it is the last time I shall ask you. I am going to Dresden\r\n     and shall there take a bride unless you make up your mind.” I\r\n     laughingly gave him my old answer, heart and head being occupied\r\n     with the widespread misery: “I really haven’t had time, dear\r\n     Carl.” We parted--he became my enemy.\r\n\r\nRECENT INVESTIGATIONS IN FRANCE\r\n\r\nShortly after the appearance of La Mara’s essay in 1909, a singular\r\ncontribution to the controversy touching the “Immortal Beloved”\r\ncame from France. The essay had been reviewed in the “Revue des\r\nDeux Mondes,” whereupon the editor of “Le Temps” asked one of its\r\ncontributors to make inquiry as to possible family traditions of the\r\nmother of M. F. de Gerando, a grand-niece of the Countess Therese.\r\nThis was done, but the lady would hear nothing of an identification\r\nof her grand-aunt with the object of Beethoven’s passion. Then came\r\njournalistic insinuations that family pride had much to do with the\r\ndenial. This provoked M. de Gerando, who undertook, in the “Mercure de\r\nFrance,” to answer the arguments of Thayer and La Mara. There was one\r\nludicrous feature in his argument and a new revelation. He disposed\r\nof the kiss sent to Therese by Beethoven through her brother Count\r\nFranz, by saying it was only such a familiarity as an old man might be\r\npermitted to indulge towards a young pupil; this notwithstanding that\r\nTherese was born in 1775 and Beethoven in 1770 and at the time he wrote\r\nthe love-letter was still laboring under the delusion that the year\r\nof his birth was 1772. The revelation consisted in the circumstance,\r\nset forth by him, that among the letters of the Countess Therese he\r\nhad found a thick portfolio inscribed “The Journal of my Heart. No\r\nRomance,” which (I quote now from an article contributed by Mr. Philip\r\nHale to the “New Music Review,” in the numbers for July and September,\r\n1909)\r\n\r\n     contained many letters, notes, messages written at all hours,\r\n     and addressed to a man, whose Christian name was Louis. Mr. de\r\n     Gerando, who has been unable to learn the family name of this\r\n     man, thought at first, and naturally, that Beethoven was the one;\r\n     but this Louis, with whom Therese was passionately in love, to\r\n     whom she was betrothed, without the knowledge of others, was a\r\n     young man of noble family, much younger than Therese, and had\r\n     been educated at the Theresianum in Vienna, a school frequented\r\n     by young noblemen. “Van Beethoven was older than the Countess\r\n     Brunsvik. He was not noble by birth. He never attended the\r\n     Theresianum.” The letters reveal a strange and violent passion.\r\n     They are at times cold and philosophical. When Therese signed them\r\n     with her name, they were true love-letters. When she signed them\r\n     with the Greek word “Diotima,” the name of a priestess of beauty\r\n     and love mentioned by Plato, they were metaphysical speculations,\r\n     long-winded discussions on the end of life and the nature of love.\r\n     “I do not think that Beethoven would have been contented with this\r\n     correspondence of encyclopædists.” There were a few letters from\r\n     Louis, one of them sealed with a coat of arms, and thus there is\r\n     hope of identification.\r\n\r\n     One might answer, continues Mr. Hale, that Therese perhaps loved\r\n     twice; that there were two Louis in the field. Mr. de Gerando\r\n     does not find this probable. Therese was cerebral in her passion.\r\n     She knew passion, but her intellectual side revolted at it, and,\r\n     when her brain controlled her, she could write phrases like this:\r\n     “To think that I could have lowered myself even to the point of\r\n     marrying him!” (But, one might reply, the countess might well\r\n     have said this with reference to Beethoven, who was beneath her\r\n     in station.) She rained contempt on the man who had awakened in\r\n     her the love that she detested, and when she had driven him from\r\n     her mind, she wrote exultantly: “Free! Free! Free!” Mr. de Gerando\r\n     argues from this that she would not a second time have given up\r\n     her independence, but nothing that a woman like Therese would have\r\n     done should surprise even a great-grand-nephew.\r\n\r\n     Mr. de Gerando does not understand how any love affair between\r\n     Therese and Beethoven could have escaped the curious gossips in\r\n     society, eager for news and scandal. “The adventure of Therese de\r\n     Brunsvik with Louis appears to me to be a sufficient reason to\r\n     judge the theory of Thayer inane. At the same time it explains\r\n     to us the genesis of this theory. It is now certain, as far as\r\n     I am concerned, that some resemblance of the affair between the\r\n     Countess of Brunsvik and Louis had come down to Thayer. The\r\n     similarity of the names, the letter in which the kiss was sent,\r\n     and other and more vague indices, led the American biographer\r\n     to turn the noble Hungarian dame into the ‘well-beloved’ of\r\n     Beethoven.” Such was, in substance, the article of Mr. de Gerando.\r\n     It is fair to ask him how the love affair between Therese and the\r\n     mysterious Louis, young, noble, etc., escaped the curious gossips,\r\n     escaped them so completely that even the great-grand-nephew of\r\n     Therese is unable to find out the family name of her lover.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[120] The Editor of this English edition of Thayer’s “Life of\r\nBeethoven” is unwilling to admit that the author’s argument against the\r\nCountess Guicciardi as the lady to whom the famous love-letter which is\r\nthe basis of the episode referred to by the author, has been disproved;\r\nor that the burden of proof is against Thayer’s theory (never put\r\nforward as a demonstrated fact, but rather as what the scientists call\r\na “working hypothesis”) that the object of his love at the time the\r\nletter was written was the Countess Therese Brunswick (or Brunsvik, as\r\nthe Hungarian branch of the family wrote the name). The question is\r\none of great difficulty, however, and the Editor has thought it wise,\r\nexpedient and only fair to the memory of Mr. Thayer, to bring together\r\nthe _disjecta membra_ of his argument as they are to be found in the\r\nbody of Vol. II and the body and Appendices of Vol. III of the original\r\nGerman edition, in a continuous chapter, and then to add, in the form\r\nof a comprehensive postscript, an abstract of the opinion of others\r\nand some suggestions of his own touching the woman who, though not yet\r\ndefinitively identified, wears the halo which streams from the title\r\nwhich Beethoven bestowed upon her--his “Immortal Beloved.” It will be\r\nobserved that the question turns largely on an adjustment of dates--a\r\nnecessary procedure in other affairs of Beethoven’s besides those of\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\n[121] Jahn transcribes the last words (“_je la méprisois_,” _etc._) as\r\nfollows: _Elle est née Guicciardi elle étoit_ (an illegible word marked\r\nwith an interrogation point) _qu epouse de lui (avant son voyage) de\r\nl’Italie. Arrivée à Vienne et elle cherchoit moi pleurant, mais je la\r\nméprisois._\r\n\r\nLudwig Nohl asserts that the words “_arrivée à Vienne_” had been\r\n“added” by Schindler. But Schindler printed the passage in 1845 as\r\nwell as in 1860 thus: _Elle étoit l’épouse de lui avant son voyage\r\nen Italie.... Arrivée a Vienne elle cherchoit moi pleurant_, _etc._\r\nIn the edition of 1860 of his biography of Beethoven he adds the\r\nfollowing remark: “One of the conversation books of 1823, all of which\r\nare preserved in the Royal Court Library at Berlin, contains these\r\nrevelations.” If Nohl’s assertion is correct it follows that Schindler\r\nlied and deceived the public, being guilty of a forgery which escaped\r\nthe eyes of both Jahn and Thayer; and that, furthermore, he was guilty\r\nof the folly of calling attention to the very book whose contents\r\nhe had falsified. Nohl asserts further that Giulietta had sought an\r\ninterview with Beethoven before her journey to Italy. On such an act he\r\nfounds the assertion that the young woman, married only a few months,\r\nwas already willing to leave her husband. From circumstances unknown to\r\nNohl it is certain that the visit did not take place until after her\r\nreturn to Vienna in 1822.\r\n\r\n[122] The Editor of this English edition takes the liberty of inserting\r\nthe letter in the body of the text. Mr. Thayer, or his first German\r\nEditor, Dr. Deiters, put it in the appendix to the third volume,\r\nfollowing it with an argument advanced to show that it was not\r\naddressed to the Countess Guicciardi. This argument the English Editor\r\nhas also transferred to the body of the text so that the discussion may\r\nbe read continuously.\r\n\r\n[123] From here on the Editor of this English edition presents Mr.\r\nThayer’s further contentions as they are set forth in the first\r\nappendix to Vol. III of the first German edition, though in the form of\r\na translation--the original manuscript not having reached his hands.\r\n\r\n[124] Ludwig Nohl.\r\n\r\n[125] These concluding remarks, from chapters V and VI of Vol. III of\r\nthe first German edition, are brought in here to complete the author’s\r\npublic utterances on the subject of the identity of the “Immortal\r\nBeloved.” Thayer is discussing the failure of Beethoven’s marriage\r\nproject.\r\n\r\n[126] Amongst Beethoven’s posthumous effects was found a portrait in\r\noil by J. B. von Lampi with the following inscription on the back of\r\nthe frame:\r\n\r\n    To the Unique Genius\r\n    To the Great Artist\r\n    To the Good Man\r\n\r\n    from T.B.\r\n\r\n    (Dem seltenen Genie, Dem grossen\r\n    Künstler, Dem guten Menschen)\r\n\r\nThis picture went from the possession of the widow of Beethoven’s\r\nnephew Karl into that of Georg Hellmesbeger Sr. in 1861 and was\r\npresented by his grandson to the Beethoven-Haus Verein in Bonn, where\r\nit is now preserved. It is, in all probability, the portrait of which\r\nBeethoven speaks in a letter to Count Franz von Brunswick, dated July\r\n11, 1811: “Since I do not know how the portrait fell into your hands,\r\nit would be best were you to bring it with you; an amiable artist will\r\nno doubt be found who will copy it for the sake of friendship.” Besides\r\nthe portrait of the Countess Therese there was also a medallion picture\r\nof the Countess Guicciardi amongst the effects left by Beethoven. It\r\nwas identified as such by her son, who died in 1893. (See Breuning,\r\n“Aus dem Schwarzspanierhause,” p. 124.)\r\n\r\n[127] Riemann in his revision of Vol. II of this biography says, “The\r\nstatement in the second and third volumes of the first edition were\r\nbased on the belief that the serious marriage project of Beethoven\r\nwhich led him to ask Wegeler to get for him [a transcript of] his\r\nbaptismal certificate, but which fell through soon after, must needs\r\nbe connected with the person to whom the love-letter was addressed.\r\nBut since it has been determined by a careful study of Clementi’s\r\nletters that Beethoven’s offer of marriage, in 1810, most certainly\r\nreferred to Therese von Malfatti, who, however, as we shall see, cannot\r\nbe considered in connection with the love-letter, this combination\r\nis become untenable. A large number of Beethoven’s letters must be\r\nassigned to entirely different years, because Clementi’s correspondence\r\nwith his partner Collard makes it certain that the honorarium for\r\nthe works sold in 1807 was not paid out till the spring of 1810. The\r\nrelations of Beethoven to Therese Malfatti are thus transferred from\r\n1807 to 1809-1810, and it can no longer be maintained that 1810 was the\r\nyear in which Beethoven’s prospect of a marriage with Therese Brunswick\r\ncame to an end.” This means that Dr. Riemann believes that while a man\r\nof 38 years of age would not write a love-letter like Beethoven’s to a\r\ngirl of less than 14 years he would try to marry her when he was 40 and\r\nshe a trifle under 16.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXII\r\n\r\n     The Year 1802--The Heiligenstadt Will--Beethoven’s Views on\r\n     Arrangements--A Defence of Beethoven’s Brothers--The Slanders\r\n     of Romancers and Unscrupulous Biographers--Compositions and\r\n     Publications of the Year.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe impatient Beethoven, vexed at the tardy improvement of his\r\nhealth under the treatment of Vering, made that change of physicians\r\ncontemplated in his letter to Wegeler. This was done some time in the\r\nwinter 1801-1802, and is all the foundation there is for Schindler’s\r\nstory of “a serious illness in the first months of this year for which\r\nhe was treated by the highly esteemed physician Dr. Schmidt.” The\r\nremarkable list of compositions and publications belonging to this\r\nyear is proof sufficient that he suffered no physical disability of\r\nsuch a nature as seriously to interrupt his ordinary vocations; as\r\nis also the utter silence of Ries, Breuning, Czerny, Doležalek and\r\nBeethoven himself. The tone of the letters written at the time is also\r\nsignificant on this point.\r\n\r\nConcerning the failure of his project to follow the example set in 1800\r\nand give a concert towards the close of the winter in the theatre we\r\nlearn all we know from a letter from his brother Carl to Breitkopf and\r\nHärtel dated April 22, 1802. Therein we read:\r\n\r\n     My brother would himself have written to you, but he is\r\n     ill-disposed towards everything because the Director of the\r\n     Theatre, Baron von Braun, who, as is known, is a stupid and rude\r\n     fellow, refused him the use of the Theatre for his concert and\r\n     gave it to other really mediocre artists; and I believe it must\r\n     vex him greatly to see himself so unworthily treated, particularly\r\n     as the Baron has no cause and my brother has dedicated several\r\n     works to his wife.\r\n\r\nWhen one looks down from the Kahlenberg towards Vienna in the bright,\r\nsweet springtime, the interesting country is almost worthy of\r\nTennyson’s description:\r\n\r\n                                It lies\r\n    Deep-meadowed, happy, fair with orchard-lawns\r\n    And bowery hollows, crown’d with summer sea.\r\n\r\nConspicuous are the villages, Döbling, hard by the city Nussdorfer\r\nline, and Heiligenstadt, divided from Döbling by a ridge of higher land\r\nin a deep gorge.\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN AT HEILIGENSTADT\r\n\r\nDr. Schmidt, having enjoined upon Beethoven to spare his hearing as\r\nmuch as possible, he removed for the summer to the place last named.\r\nThere is much and good reason to believe that his rooms were in a\r\nlarge peasant house still standing, on the elevated plain beyond the\r\nvillage on the road to Nussdorf, now with many neat cottages near,\r\nbut then probably quite solitary. In those years, there was from his\r\nwindows an unbroken view across fields, the Danube and the Marchfeld,\r\nto the Carpathian mountains that line the horizon. A few minutes’\r\nwalk citywards brought him to the baths of Heiligenstadt; or, in the\r\nopposite direction, to the secluded valley in which at another period\r\nhe composed the “Pastoral” symphony. The vast increase of Vienna and\r\nits environs in population, has caused corresponding changes; but in\r\n1802, that peasant house seems to have offered him everything he could\r\ndesire; fresh air, sun, green fields, delightful walks, bathing, easy\r\naccess to his physician, and yet a degree of solitude which now is not\r\neasy to conceive as having been attainable so near the capital.\r\n\r\nPart of a letter written hence to Breitkopf and Härtel, but no longer\r\nin the possession of that house, affords another illustration of\r\nBeethoven’s excellent common sense and discrimination in all that\r\npertained to his art.\r\n\r\n     ... Concerning arrangements I am heartily glad that you rejected\r\n     them. The unnatural rage now prevalent to transplant even\r\n     _pianoforte pieces_ to stringed instruments, instruments so\r\n     utterly opposite to each other in all respects, ought to come\r\n     to an end. I insist stoutly that only Mozart could arrange his\r\n     pianoforte pieces for other instruments--and Haydn--and, without\r\n     wishing to put myself in the class of these great men, I also\r\n     assert it touching my _pianoforte sonatas_ too, since not only are\r\n     whole passages to be omitted and changed, but also--things are to\r\n     be added, and here lies the obstacle, to _overcome_ which one must\r\n     either be the master himself or at least have the same _skill and\r\n     inventive power_--I transcribed a single one of my sonatas for\r\n     string quartet,[128] yielding to great persuasion, and I certainly\r\n     know that it would not be an easy matter for another to do as\r\n     well.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties here mentioned, it will be noticed, are those of\r\ntranscribing pianoforte music for other instruments; the contrary\r\noperation is so comparatively easy, that Beethoven very rarely\r\nperformed it himself, but left it for the most part to young musicians,\r\nwhose work he revised and corrected.\r\n\r\n     There are a great many pieces by Beethoven (says Ries), published\r\n     with the designation: _Arrangé par l’Auteur même_; but only\r\n     four of these are genuine, namely: from his famous Septet he\r\n     arranged first a violin quintet, and then a Pianoforte Trio; out\r\n     of his Pianoforte Quintet (with four wind-instruments) he made\r\n     a Pianoforte Quartet with three string-instruments; finally, he\r\n     arranged the Violin Concerto which is dedicated to Stephan von\r\n     Breuning (Op. 61) as a Pianoforte Concerto. Many other pieces were\r\n     arranged by me, revised by Beethoven, and then sold as Beethoven’s\r\n     by his brother Caspar.\r\n\r\nWithout calling in question here the general statement in this\r\ncitation, it may be remarked, that if Ries is right in respect to\r\nthe arrangement of the Septet as a Quintet, the work remained in\r\nmanuscript, for the one published was by Hoffmeister. But the Trio\r\nwas begun and, as is believed, finished this year. Its history has\r\nbeen told. Ries’s statement is neither exhaustive nor altogether exact\r\ntouching the arrangements of the Septet. Moreover, in 1806, without\r\nBeethoven’s knowledge or consent, he arranged the six Quartets, Op. 18,\r\nand the three Trios for strings, Op. 9, as Pianoforte Trios.\r\n\r\nAn interesting anecdote from the “Notizen” may be introduced here.\r\n“Count Browne,” says Ries,\r\n\r\n     made a rather long sojourn about this time in Baden near Vienna,\r\n     where I was called upon frequently to play Beethoven’s music\r\n     evenings in the presence of enthusiastic Beethovenians, sometimes\r\n     from notes, sometimes by heart. Here I had an opportunity to\r\n     learn how in the majority of cases a _name_ alone is sufficient\r\n     to characterize everything in a composition as beautiful and\r\n     excellent, or mediocre and bad. One day, weary of playing without\r\n     notes, I improvised a march without a thought as to its merit\r\n     or any ulterior purpose. An old countess who actually tormented\r\n     Beethoven with her devotion, went into ecstasies over it, thinking\r\n     it was a new composition of his, which I, in order to make sport\r\n     of her and the other enthusiasts, affirmed only too quickly.\r\n     Unhappily Beethoven came to Baden the next day. He had scarcely\r\n     entered Count Browne’s room in the evening when the old countess\r\n     began to speak of the most admirable and glorious march. Imagine\r\n     my embarrassment! Knowing well that Beethoven could not tolerate\r\n     the old countess, I hurriedly drew him aside and whispered to\r\n     him that I had merely meant to make sport of her foolishness. To\r\n     my good fortune he accepted the explanation in good part, but my\r\n     embarrassment grew when I was called upon to repeat the march,\r\n     which turned out worse since Beethoven stood at my side. He was\r\n     overwhelmed with praise on all hands and his genius lauded, he\r\n     listening in a perturbed manner and with growing rage until he\r\n     found relief in a roar of laughter. Later he remarked to me: “You\r\n     see, my dear Ries, those are the great cognoscenti, who wish to\r\n     judge every composition so correctly and severely. Only give\r\n     them the name of their favorite; they will need nothing more.”\r\n     Yet the march led to one good result: Count Browne immediately\r\n     commissioned Beethoven to compose three Marches for Pianoforte,\r\n     four hands.[129]\r\n\r\nMELANCHOLY INFLUENCE OF HEILIGENSTADT\r\n\r\nThe seclusion of Heiligenstadt was of itself so seductive to Beethoven,\r\nthat the prudence of Dr. Schmidt in advising him to withdraw so much\r\nfrom society, may be doubted; the more, because the benefit to his\r\nhearing proved to be small or none. It gave him too many lonely hours\r\nin which to brood over his calamity; it enabled him still to flatter\r\nhimself that his secret was yet safe; it led him to defer, too long for\r\nhis peace of mind, the bitter moment of confession; and consequently\r\nto deprive himself needlessly of the tender compassion and ready\r\nsympathy of friends, whose lips were sealed so long as he withheld his\r\nconfidence. But, in truth, the secret so jealously guarded was already\r\nknown--but who could inform him of it?--though not long nor generally,\r\nas we learn from Ries.\r\n\r\nIt was well for Beethoven, when the time came for him to return to the\r\ncity, and to resume the duties and obligations of his profession. To\r\nwhat depths of despondency he sometimes sank in those solitary hours\r\nat Heiligenstadt, is shown by a remarkable and most touching paper,\r\nwritten there just before his return to town, but never seen by other\r\neyes until after his death. Although addressed to and intended for\r\nboth his brothers, it is, as Schindler has remarked, “surprising and\r\nsingular,” that the name “Johann” is left utterly blank throughout--not\r\neven being indicated by the usual.... It is couched in terms of\r\nenergetic expression, rising occasionally to eloquence--somewhat rude\r\nand unpolished indeed, but, perhaps, for that reason the more striking.\r\nThe manuscript[130] is so carefully written, and disfigured by so few\r\nerasures and corrections, as to prove the great pains taken with it\r\nbefore the final copy was made. The closing sentences, in which he\r\ndiscovers his expectations of an early death, have acquired double\r\nimportance since the publication of Schindler’s suicide story, for the\r\ndecisive manner in which they remove every possible suspicion that,\r\neven in his present hypochondria, he could contemplate such a crime.\r\n\r\nRies’s paragraph upon Beethoven’s deafness, in which he relates\r\na circumstance alluded to in the document, is its most fitting\r\nintroduction:\r\n\r\n     As early as 1802, Beethoven suffered from deafness at various\r\n     times, but the affliction each time passed away. The beginning\r\n     of his hard hearing was a matter upon which he was so sensitive\r\n     that one had to be careful not to make him feel his deficiency by\r\n     loud speech. When he failed to understand a thing he generally\r\n     attributed it to his absent-mindedness, to which, indeed, he was\r\n     subject in a great degree. He lived much in the country, whither\r\n     I went often to take a lesson from him. At times, at 8 o’clock\r\n     in the morning after breakfast he would say: “Let us first take\r\n     a short walk.” We went, and frequently did not return till 3 or\r\n     4 o’clock, after having made a meal in some village. On one of\r\n     these wanderings Beethoven gave me the first striking proof of\r\n     his loss of hearing, concerning which Stephan von Breuning had\r\n     already spoken to me. I called his attention to a shepherd who was\r\n     piping very agreeably in the woods on a flute made of a twig of\r\n     elder. For half an hour Beethoven could hear nothing, and though I\r\n     assured him that it was the same with me (which was not the case),\r\n     he became extremely quiet and morose. When occasionally he seemed\r\n     to be merry it was generally to the extreme of boisterousness; but\r\n     this happened seldom.\r\n\r\nFollowing is the text of the document:\r\n\r\nTEXT OF THE HEILIGENSTADT “WILL”\r\n\r\n     For my brothers Carl and ---- Beethoven.\r\n\r\n     O ye men who think or say that I am malevolent, stubborn or\r\n     misanthropic, how greatly do ye wrong me, you do not know the\r\n     secret causes of my seeming, from childhood my heart and mind\r\n     were disposed to the gentle feeling of good will, I was even\r\n     ever eager to accomplish great deeds, but reflect now that for\r\n     6 years I have been in a hopeless case, aggravated by senseless\r\n     physicians, cheated year after year in the hope of improvement,\r\n     finally compelled to face the prospect of a _lasting malady_\r\n     (whose cure will take years or, perhaps, be impossible), born\r\n     with an ardent and lively temperament, even susceptible to the\r\n     diversions of society, I was compelled early to isolate myself,\r\n     to live in loneliness, when I at times tried to forget all this,\r\n     O how harshly was I repulsed by the doubly sad experience of my\r\n     bad hearing, and yet it was impossible for me to say to men speak\r\n     louder, shout, for I am deaf, Ah how could I possibly admit an\r\n     infirmity in the _one sense_ which should have been more perfect\r\n     in me than in others, a sense which I once possessed in highest\r\n     perfection, a perfection such as few surely in my profession\r\n     enjoy or ever have enjoyed--O I cannot do it, therefore forgive\r\n     me when you see me draw back when I would gladly mingle with\r\n     you, my misfortune is doubly painful because it must lead to my\r\n     being misunderstood, for me there can be no recreation in society\r\n     of my fellows, refined intercourse, mutual exchange of thought,\r\n     only just as little as the greatest needs command may I mix with\r\n     society, I must live like an exile, if I approach near to people\r\n     a hot terror seizes upon me, a fear that I may be subjected to\r\n     the danger of letting my condition be observed--thus it has been\r\n     during the last half year which I spent in the country, commanded\r\n     by my intelligent physician to spare my hearing as much as\r\n     possible, in this almost meeting my present natural disposition,\r\n     although I sometimes ran counter to it yielding to my inclination\r\n     for society, but what a humiliation when one stood beside me and\r\n     heard a flute in the distance and _I heard nothing_ or someone\r\n     heard _the shepherd singing_ and again I heard nothing, such\r\n     incidents brought me to the verge of despair, but little more\r\n     and I would have put an end to my life--only art it was that\r\n     withheld me, ah it seemed impossible to leave the world until I\r\n     had produced all that I felt called upon to produce, and so I\r\n     endured this wretched existence--truly wretched, an excitable\r\n     body which a sudden change can throw from the best into the worst\r\n     state--Patience--it is said I must now choose for my guide, I have\r\n     done so, I hope my determination will remain firm to endure until\r\n     it pleases the inexorable parcæ to break the thread, perhaps I\r\n     shall get better, perhaps not, I am prepared. Forced already in\r\n     my 28th year to become a philosopher, O it is not easy, less easy\r\n     for the artist than for any one else--Divine One thou lookest into\r\n     my inmost soul, thou knowest it, thou knowest that love of man\r\n     and desire to do good live therein. O men, when some day you read\r\n     these words, reflect that ye did me wrong and let the unfortunate\r\n     one comfort himself and find one of his kind who despite all\r\n     the obstacles of nature yet did all that was in his power to be\r\n     accepted among worthy artists and men. You my brothers Carl and\r\n     as soon as I am dead if Dr. Schmid is still alive ask him in my\r\n     name to describe my malady and attach this document to the history\r\n     of my illness so that so far as is possible at least the world\r\n     may become reconciled with me after my death. At the same time\r\n     I declare you two to be the heirs to my small fortune (if so it\r\n     can be called), divide it fairly, bear with and help each other,\r\n     what injury you have done me you know was long ago forgiven. To\r\n     you brother Carl I give special thanks for the attachment you\r\n     have displayed towards me of late. It is my wish that your lives\r\n     may be better and freer from care than I have had, recommend\r\n     _virtue_ to your children, it alone can give happiness, not money,\r\n     I speak from experience, it was virtue that upheld me in misery,\r\n     to it next to my art I owe the fact that I did not end my life by\r\n     suicide--Farewell and love each other--I thank all my friends,\r\n     particularly _Prince Lichnowsky_ and _Professor Schmid_--I desire\r\n     that the instruments from Prince L. be preserved by one of you\r\n     but let no quarrel result from this, so soon as they can serve\r\n     you a better purpose sell them, how glad will I be if I can\r\n     still be helpful to you in my grave--with joy I hasten towards\r\n     death--if it comes before I shall have had an opportunity to show\r\n     all my artistic capacities it will still come too early for me\r\n     despite my hard fate and I shall probably wish that it had come\r\n     later--but even then I am satisfied, will it not free me from a\r\n     state of endless suffering? Come when thou wilt I shall meet thee\r\n     bravely--Farewell and do not wholly forget me when I am dead, I\r\n     deserve this of you in having often in life thought of you how to\r\n     make you happy, be so--\r\n\r\n    Ludwig van Beethoven.\r\n    (seal)\r\n\r\n    Heiglnstadt,\r\n    October 6th,\r\n    1802.\r\n\r\n     For my Brothers Carl and to be read and executed after my death.\r\n\r\n     Heiglnstadt, October 10th, 1802, thus do I take my farewell of\r\n     thee--and indeed sadly--yes that beloved hope--which I brought\r\n     with me when I came here to be cured at least in a degree--I must\r\n     wholly abandon, as the leaves of autumn fall and are withered so\r\n     hope has been blighted, almost as I came--I go away--even the\r\n     high courage--which often inspired me in the beautiful days of\r\n     summer--has disappeared--O Providence--grant me at last but one\r\n     day of pure _joy_--it is so long since real joy echoed in my\r\n     heart--O when--O when, O Divine One--shall I feel it again in the\r\n     temple of nature and of men--Never? no--O that would be too hard.\r\n\r\nA QUICK REVERSION TO MERRIMENT\r\n\r\n_De profundis clamavit!_ And yet in that retirement whence came a paper\r\nof such profound sadness was wrought out the Symphony in D; a work\r\nwhose grand and imposing introduction--brilliant Allegro, a Larghetto\r\n“so lovely, so pure and amiably conceived,” written in the scenes\r\nwhich gave inspiration to the divine “Pastorale” of which its serene\r\ntranquility seems the precursor; a Scherzo “as merry, wayward, skipping\r\nand charming as anything possible,” as even Oulibichef admits; and a\r\nFinale, the very intoxication of a spirit “intoxicated with fire”--made\r\nit, like the Quartets, an era both in the life of its author and in\r\nthe history of instrumental music. In life, as in music, the more\r\nprofoundly the depths of feeling are sounded in the Adagio, the more\r\n“merry to the verge of boisterousness” the Scherzo which follows. But\r\nwho, reading that in October that beloved hope had been abandoned and\r\nthe high courage which had often inspired him in the beautiful days of\r\nsummer had disappeared, could anticipate that in November, through the\r\nwonderful elasticity of his nature, his mind would have so recovered\r\nits tone as to leave no trace visible of the so recent depression\r\nand gloom? Perhaps the mere act of giving his feelings vent in that\r\nextraordinary _promemoria_ may have brought on the crisis, and from\r\nthat moment the reaction may have begun.\r\n\r\nThe following letter to Zmeskall (to which the recipient appended the\r\ndate, November, 1802) is whimsically written on both sides of a strip\r\nof very ordinary coarse writing paper fourteen and a half inches long\r\nby four and three-quarters wide:\r\n\r\n     You may, my dear Z., talk as plainly as you please to Walter\r\n     in the affair of mine, first because he deserves it and then\r\n     because since the belief has gone forth that I am no longer\r\n     on good terms with Walter I am pestered by the whole swarm of\r\n     pianoforte makers wishing to serve me--and gratis, moreover, every\r\n     one wants to build a pianoforte for me just to my liking; thus\r\n     Reicha was urgently begged by the man who made a pianoforte for\r\n     him to persuade me to let him make me one, and he is one of the\r\n     more honest at whose place I have seen good instruments--make him\r\n     understand therefore that I will pay him 30 florins, whereas I\r\n     might have one from all the others for nothing, but I will pay 30\r\n     florins only on condition that it be of mahogany and I also want\r\n     the one string (_una corda_) pedal--if he does not agree to this\r\n     make it plain to him that I shall choose one of the others and\r\n     also introduce him to Haydn--a Frenchman, stranger, is coming to\r\n     me at about 12 o’clock to-day _volti_\r\n\r\n     _subito_\r\n\r\n     Herr R(eicha) and I will have the pleasure of _displaying my art\r\n     on a piano_ by Jakesch--_ad notam_--if you want also to come we\r\n     shall have a good time since afterward we, Reicha, our miserable\r\n     Imperial Baron and the Frenchman, will dine together--you do not\r\n     need to don a _black coat_ as we shall be _a party of men only_.\r\n\r\nAnother letter to Zmeskall (who noted the date November 13, 1802, on\r\nit) runs as follows:\r\n\r\n     Dear Z.--_Give up your music at the Prince’s, nothing else can be\r\n     done._ We shall rehearse at your house to-morrow morning early at\r\n     half past 8 and the production will be at my house at eleven--\r\n\r\n     _ad dio_ excellent Plenipotentiarius _regni Beethovensis_\r\n\r\n     The rascals have been jailed as they deserved in their own\r\n     handwriting.[131]\r\n\r\n“Production” of what? The next Quintet, Op. 29, no doubt. “At my\r\nhouse”--no longer in the Hamberger House on the Bastion, but in the\r\none pointed out by Czerny: “Beethoven lived a little later (about\r\n1802) on the Petersplatz, the corner house beside the Guard-house,\r\n_vis-à-vis_ of my present lodgings, in the fourth (?) storey, where I\r\nvisited him as often as I did (in the Tiefen Graben). If you will give\r\nme the pleasure of a visit (No. 576) beside Daum, second storey, I will\r\nshow you the windows. There I visited several times every week.”[132]\r\n\r\nWhat whim could have induced Beethoven to remove to this house with the\r\nbells of St. Peter’s on one side and those of St. Stephen’s sounding\r\ndown upon him on the other, and he so suffering with his ears? Perhaps\r\nbecause friends were in the house. Förster’s earliest recollections\r\nof Beethoven date from this winter and this house; for his father’s\r\ndwelling was in the third storey above him. He remembers that Beethoven\r\nvolunteered to instruct him in pianoforte playing, and that he was\r\nforced to rise at six in the morning and descend the cold stairs,\r\nchild as he was, hardly six years of age, to take his lessons; and on\r\none occasion going up again crying because his master had whipped his\r\nlittle fingers with one of the iron or steel needles used in knitting\r\nthe coarse yarn jackets worn by women in service.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the Marches for Four Hands (Op. 45), ordered by\r\nCount Browne, dates also from the house in the Petersplatz.\r\n\r\n     He composed part of the second march while giving me a lesson on\r\n     a sonata which I had to play in the evening at the Count’s house\r\n     at a little concert--a thing that still seems incomprehensible\r\n     to me. I was also to play the marches on the same occasion with\r\n     him. While we were playing young Count P... sitting in the doorway\r\n     leading to the next room spoke so loudly and continuously to a\r\n     pretty woman, that Beethoven, after several efforts had vainly\r\n     been made to secure quiet, suddenly took my hands from the keys in\r\n     the middle of the music, jumped up and said very loudly, “I will\r\n     not play for such swine!” All efforts to get him to return to the\r\n     pianoforte were vain, and he would not even allow me to play the\r\n     sonata. So the music came to an end in the midst of much ill humor.\r\n\r\n     In composing Beethoven tested his pieces at the pianoforte until\r\n     he found them to his liking, and sang the while. His voice in\r\n     singing was hideous. It was thus that Czerny heard him at work on\r\n     the four-hand Marches while waiting in a side room.\r\n\r\nAccording to Jahn’s papers this statement came also from Czerny.\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN AND HIS BROTHERS\r\n\r\nIt is now necessary to turn back to November and again undertake\r\nthe annoying and thankless task of examining a broad tissue of\r\nmingled fact and misrepresentation and severing the truth from the\r\nerror; this time the subject is the relations which existed between\r\nBeethoven and his brothers in these years. A letter written by Kaspar\r\nis the occasion of taking it up here. Johann André, a music publisher\r\nat Offenbach-on-the-Main, following the example of Hoffmeister,\r\nNägeli, Breitkopf and Härtel and others, now applied to Beethoven for\r\nmanuscripts. Kaspar wrote the reply under date November 23, 1802:\r\n\r\n     ... At present we have nothing but a Symphony, a grand Concerto\r\n     for Pianoforte, the first at 300 florins and the second at the\r\n     same price, if you should want three pianoforte sonatas I could\r\n     furnish them for no less than 900 florins, all according to Vienna\r\n     standard, and these you could not have all at once, but one every\r\n     five or six weeks, because my brother does not trouble himself\r\n     with such trifles any longer and composes only oratorios, operas,\r\n     etc.\r\n\r\n     Also you are to send us eight copies of _every_ piece which you\r\n     may possibly engrave. Whether the pieces please you or not I beg\r\n     you to answer, otherwise I might be prevented from selling them to\r\n     someone else.\r\n\r\n     We have also two Adagios for the Violin with complete instrumental\r\n     accompaniment, which will cost 135 florins, and two little easy\r\n     Sonatas, each with two movements, which are at your service for\r\n     280 florins. In addition I beg you to present our compliments to\r\n     our friend Koch.\r\n\r\n    Your obedient,\r\n\r\n    K. v. Beethoven.\r\n\r\n    R.I. Treasury official.\r\n\r\nThis ludicrous display of the young man’s self-importance as “Royal\r\nImperial Treasury Official” and Ludwig van Beethoven’s factotum is\r\ncertainly very absurd; but hardly affords adequate grounds for the\r\nexceeding scorn of Schindler’s remarks upon it. It is in itself\r\nsufficiently provocative of prejudice against its writer. But a display\r\nof vanity and self-esteem is ridiculous, not criminal.\r\n\r\nThe general charge brought by Ries against Kaspar and Johann van\r\nBeethoven is this:\r\n\r\n     His brothers sought in particular to keep all his intimate friends\r\n     away from him, and no matter what wrongs they did him, of which\r\n     he was convinced, they cost him only a few tears and all was\r\n     immediately forgotten. On such occasions he was in the habit of\r\n     saying: “But they are my brothers, nevertheless,” and the friend\r\n     received a rebuke for his good-nature and frankness. The brothers\r\n     attained their purpose in causing the withdrawal from him of many\r\n     friends, especially when, because of his hard hearing, it became\r\n     more difficult to converse with him.\r\n\r\nTwo years after the “Notizen” left the press Schindler published his\r\n“Biography.” In it, although he first knew Beethoven in 1814, Johann\r\nsome years later and Kaspar probably never, and therefore personally\r\ncould know nothing of the facts of this period, yet he made the picture\r\nstill darker. The special charge against Kaspar is that “about this\r\ntime (in 1800) he began to rule Beethoven and made him suspicious of\r\nhis most sincere friends and devotees by means of false representations\r\nand even jealousy.”\r\n\r\nThere is a class of writers in Germany, whom no regard for the feelings\r\nof the living, no veneration for the memories of the great dead, no\r\nscruples on the score of truth, and even, in some cases, not respect\r\nand admiration for the greatest living genius, talent, and literary\r\nor scientific fame, restrain from using, or moderate their use of,\r\nwhatever can add piquancy to their appeals to the prurient imaginations\r\nof certain classes of readers. Delicacy of feeling and nicety of\r\nconscience are not to be expected of such heartless traducers of\r\nthe living and the dead; but that even the most contemptible of the\r\ntribe, regardless of the pain which such a slander of her husband’s\r\nfather must have caused to a widowed mother and her amiable children,\r\ncould venture to represent Karl Kaspar van Beethoven as the seller\r\nof his wife’s virtue and a sharer in the wages of her shame, is as\r\ninconceivable, as that his book should be received with praise by\r\ncritics and applause by the public; that it should gain its author\r\npecuniary profit instead of a prison. The story is utterly without\r\nfoundation; a pure invention and a falsehood, and is told, moreover,\r\nof poor Kaspar, at a time when as yet he had no wife! Unfortunately,\r\nthis treatment of Beethoven’s brothers is not confined to writers of\r\nnovels and feuilletonists. They, who profess to write history, no\r\nsooner strike upon this topic, than fancy seems to usurp the seat of\r\nreason and imagination to take the place of judgment. The lines of Ries\r\nexpand into paragraphs; the sentences of Schindler into chapters. But\r\nthe picture, thus overdrawn and exaggerated, in some degree corrects\r\nitself; for if the brothers were really as represented, what is to be\r\nthought of Beethoven if he in fact was so led, controlled and held in\r\nsubjection by them as described?\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS OF KARL KASPAR AND JOHANN\r\n\r\nNow, what is really known of Karl Kaspar and Johann, though it\r\nsufficiently confutes much of the calumnious nonsense which has been\r\nprinted about them, is not fitted to convey any very exalted idea of\r\ntheir characters. The same Frau Karth, who remembered Ludwig in his\r\nyouth as always “gentle and lovable,” related that Kaspar was less\r\nkindly in his disposition, “proud and presumptuous,” and that Johann\r\n“was a bit stupid, yet very good-natured.” And such they were in\r\nmanhood. Kaspar, like Ludwig, was very passionate, but more violent in\r\nhis sudden wrath; Johann, slow to wrath and placable. Notwithstanding\r\nthe poverty of his youth and early manhood, it is not known that Kaspar\r\nwas avaricious; but Johann had felt too bitterly the misery of want and\r\ndependence, and became penurious. After he had accumulated a moderate\r\nfortune, the contests between his avarice and the desire to display his\r\nwealth led to very ludicrous exhibitions. In a word, Beethoven was not\r\na phenomenon of goodness, nor were his brothers monsters of iniquity.\r\nThat both Ries and Schindler wrote honestly has not been doubted; but\r\ncommon justice demands the reminder that they wrote under the bias of\r\nstrong personal dislike to one or both brothers. Ries wrote impressions\r\nreceived at a very early time of life, and records opinions formed upon\r\nincomplete data. Schindler wrote entirely upon hearsay. Ries had not\r\ncompleted his twenty-first year when he departed from Vienna (1805).\r\nHowsoever strong were Beethoven’s gratitude to Franz Ries and affection\r\nfor Ferdinand, fourteen years was too great a disparity in age to\r\nallow that trustful and familiar intercourse between master and pupil\r\nwhich could enable the latter to speak with full knowledge; nor does a\r\nman of Beethoven’s age and position turn from old and valued friends,\r\nlike the Lichnowskys, Breuning, Zmeskall and others of whatever names,\r\nto make a youth of from 18 to 20 years, a new-comer and previously\r\na stranger, even though a favorite pupil, his confidential adviser.\r\nFacts confirm the proposition in this case. We know that Beethoven\r\nin 1801 imparted grave matters to Wegeler and Amenda, of which Ries\r\na year later had only received intimation from Breuning; and other\r\ncircumstances of which he knew nothing are recorded in the testament\r\nof 1802. The charges against the brothers, both of Ries and Schindler,\r\nare general in terms; Ries only giving specifications or instances in\r\nproof. Schindler may be passed by as but repeating the “Notizen.” Now,\r\nthe onus of Ries’s charges is this:\r\n\r\nFirst: that Kaspar thrust himself impertinently into his brother’s\r\nbusiness; second: that both brothers intrigued to isolate Beethoven\r\nfrom his intimate friends and that their machinations were in many\r\ncases successful.\r\n\r\nKARL KASPAR AS A BUSINESS MANAGER\r\n\r\nTo the first point it is to be remarked: Besides Beethoven’s often\r\nexpressed disinclination to engage personally in negotiations for the\r\nsale of his works--although when he did he showed no lack of a keen eye\r\nto profits--his physical and mental condition at this period of his\r\nlife often rendered the assistance of an agent indispensable. Accounts\r\nwere to be kept with half a dozen publishers; letters received upon\r\nbusiness were numerous and often demanded prompt replies; proof-sheets\r\nwere constantly arriving for revision and correction; copyists required\r\nsupervision; an abundance of minor matters continually coming up and\r\nneeding attention when Beethoven might be on his long rambles over\r\nhill and dale, the last man to be found in an emergency. One asks with\r\nastonishment, how could so obvious a necessity for a confidential agent\r\nhave escaped notice? Who should or could this agent be but his brother\r\nKaspar?[133] He held an honorable place in a public office, the duties\r\nof which necessarily implied the possession of those talents for, and\r\nhabits of, prompt and skillful performance of business which his early\r\nreceipt of salary and his regular advancement in position show that he\r\nreally did possess; his duties detained him in the city at all times,\r\noccasional short vacations excepted, and yet left him ample leisure\r\nto attend to his brother’s affairs; he was a musician by education\r\nand fully competent to render valuable service in that “fearful\r\nperiod of arrangements”--as it is well known he did. What would have\r\njustly been said of Beethoven if he had passed by one so eminently\r\nqualified for the task--one on whom the paternal relation and his own\r\nlong continued care and protection had given him so many claims--and\r\nhad transferred the burden from his own shoulders to those of other\r\nfriends? But if, after adequate trial, the agent proved unsatisfactory,\r\nthe case would be changed and the principal might with propriety seek\r\nneeded assistance in other quarters. And precisely this appears to\r\nhave occurred; for after a few years Kaspar disappears almost entirely\r\nfrom our history in connection with his brother’s pecuniary affairs.\r\nThis fact is stronger evidence than anything in Ries’s statements,\r\nthat Beethoven became dissatisfied with his brother’s management, and\r\nwould have still more weight had he been less fickle, inconstant and\r\nundecided in matters of business.[134]\r\n\r\nSeyfried, whose acquaintance with Beethoven ripened just at this time\r\ninto intimacy, and who in 1802-’05 had the best possible opportunities\r\nfor observation, beheld the relations between the brothers with far\r\nless jaundiced eyes than Ries. He says:\r\n\r\n     Beethoven was the more glad to choose joyous Vienna for his\r\n     future and permanent home since two younger brothers had followed\r\n     him thither, who took off his shoulders the oppressive load of\r\n     financial cares and who were compelled to act almost as guardians\r\n     for the priest of art to whom the ordinary affairs of civil life\r\n     were as strange as strange could be.\r\n\r\nAt that time Seyfried, like Ries, was ignorant of the circumstances\r\ndetailed to Wegeler and Amenda and in the testament; but the admirable\r\nselection of words in the closing phrase will strike all who have had\r\noccasion to read Beethoven’s countless notes asking advice or aid in\r\nmatters which most men would deem too trivial for even a passing word\r\nin conversation. The specifications of Ries in his charges against\r\nKaspar will not long detain us. The story of the quarrel over the\r\ndisposition of the Nägeli Sonatas may stand in all its ugliness and\r\nwith no comment save the suggestion of the possibility that Kaspar’s\r\nword as Ludwig’s agent may have been pledged to the Leipsic publisher.\r\nThe one really specific charge of Ries is the one on page 124 of the\r\n“Notizen”:\r\n\r\n     All trifles, and many things which he did not want to publish\r\n     because he thought them unworthy of his name, were secretly given\r\n     to publicity by his brother. Thus songs which he had composed\r\n     years before his departure for Vienna, became known only after he\r\n     had reached a high degree of fame. Thus, too, little compositions\r\n     which he had written in autograph albums were filched and\r\n     published.\r\n\r\nBy “trifles” Ries, of course, here refers to the “Bagatelles, Op. 33,\r\npar Louis van Beethoven, 1782,” as the manuscript is superscribed,\r\npublished in the spring of 1803. The manuscript itself proves Ries to\r\nbe in error. The words “par Louis van Beethoven” are in a hand unlike\r\nanything known to the present writer from Beethoven’s pen. This fact,\r\ntogether with a something not easily described in the appearance of\r\nthe notes, suggests the idea that this copy of the “Bagatelles” was\r\nmade by Kaspar, and compiled, except No. 6 and perhaps one other, from\r\nthe compositions of Beethoven in his boyhood. But the corrections--the\r\nwords _Andante gracioso_, _Scherzo Allegro_, _Allegretto con una certa\r\nespressione parlante_, etc., written with lead pencil or a different\r\nink, are certainly from Beethoven’s own hand; also, in still another\r\nink, the thoroughly Beethovenish “Op. 33.” No one can mistake that.\r\nThis work most assuredly was never “secretly given to the public.”[135]\r\n\r\nThe only Album composition known to have been published in those years\r\nis the song with variations, “Ich denke dein”; and this Beethoven\r\nhimself had offered to Hoffmeister before it was printed by the Kunst-\r\nund Industrie-Comptoir.\r\n\r\nThe “songs” referred to by Ries can only be those of Op. 52. The\r\noriginal manuscript, having disappeared, neither refutes nor confirms\r\nhis opinion. It is, however, exceedingly doubtful that Beethoven’s\r\nbrothers would have dared give an opus number to a stolen publication.\r\n_A priori_ Ries is more likely to be in error here than in regard to\r\nthe “Bagatelles.” Now, the only contemporary criticism upon the latter\r\nwhich has been discovered, is a single line in Moll’s “Annalen der\r\nLiteratur” (Vienna, 1804): “Deserve the title in every sense of the\r\nword.” Upon the “Song with Variations” no notice whatever has been\r\nfound. But, Opus 52 was received by the “Allgemeine Musik-Zeitung” of\r\nAugust 28, 1805, in this style; _Opera_ 47 and 38 having been duly\r\npraised, the writer continues:\r\n\r\n     Is it possible that No. 3 of these eight songs is from the pen of\r\n     this composer, admirable even in his vagaries? It must be, since\r\n     it is. At least his name is printed large on the title-page,\r\n     the publisher is mentioned, the songs were published in Vienna\r\n     where the composer lives, and, indeed, bear his latest _opus_\r\n     number. Comprehend it he who can--that a thing in all respects so\r\n     commonplace, poor, weak and in great part ludicrous should not\r\n     only emanate from such a man but even be published.\r\n\r\nKARL KASPAR A PROBABLE SCAPEGOAT\r\n\r\nAnd more like this, illustrated by copying “Das Blümchen Wunderhold.”\r\nThese citations suggest an obvious explanation of Ries’s mistake,\r\nnamely: Beethoven, mortified, ashamed, angry, purposely left him to\r\nbelieve that he was innocent of the publication of these compositions.\r\nIt was one of the advantages of having Kaspar in Vienna, that the\r\nresponsibility of such false steps could be shifted upon him. Those\r\nwho are predetermined not to admit in Beethoven’s character any of the\r\nfaults, frailties and shortcomings of our common human nature, will\r\nof course censure this explanation. Let them propose a better.[136]\r\nFinally: In the paragraph upon the efforts of Beethoven’s brothers to\r\nkeep all of the composer’s friends away from him it is easy to read\r\nbetween the lines that it was Ries himself who oft “was rebuked for\r\nhis good-nature and frankness,” which of itself to some extent lessens\r\nthe force of the charge. But it is best met by the first half of the\r\nWill, or testament, which, with the confessions to Wegeler and Amenda,\r\nas above said, open to our knowledge an inner life of the writer\r\nstudiously concealed from his protégé.\r\n\r\nIn this solemn document, written as he supposed upon the brink of the\r\ngrave, Beethoven touches upon this very question. We learn from his\r\nown affecting words, that the cause of his separation from friends\r\nlay, _not_ in the machinations of his brothers, but in his own\r\nsensitiveness. He records for future use, what he cannot now explain\r\nwithout disclosing his jealously guarded secret. That record now serves\r\na double purpose; it relieves Kaspar and Johann from a portion of the\r\nodium so long cast upon their memories; and proves Ries to be, in part\r\nat least, in error, without impugning his veracity. It is very probable\r\nRies never saw the will. Had he known and carefully read it, the\r\nprejudices of his youth must have been weakened, the opinions founded\r\nupon partial knowledge modified. He was of too noble a nature not to\r\nhave gladly seen the memories of the dead vindicated--not to have been\r\nstruck with and affected by the words of his deceased master: “To\r\nyou, brother Carl, I give special thanks for the attachment you have\r\ndisplayed towards me of late.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPass we to another topic.\r\n\r\n     On frequent occasions (says Ries), he showed a truly paternal\r\n     interest in me. From this source there sprang the written order\r\n     (in 1802), which he sent me in a fit of anger because of an\r\n     unpleasant predicament into which Carl van Beethoven had gotten\r\n     me. Beethoven wrote: “You do not need to come to Heiligenstadt;\r\n     I have no time to lose.” At the time Count Browne was indulging\r\n     himself with pleasures in which I was taking part, he being kindly\r\n     disposed towards me, and was in consequence neglecting my lessons.\r\n\r\nThat Beethoven, during the summer when his vocations were interrupted\r\nby the dark hours in which the “will” was produced, could have no time\r\nto lose in those lighter days when the spirit of labor was upon him is\r\nclear from the surprising list of compositions written and published in\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITIONS COMPLETED IN 1802\r\n\r\nThe works which were developed were the three Violin Sonatas, Op. 30;\r\nthe first two of the three Pianoforte Sonatas, Op. 31; the two sets of\r\nVariations, Op. 34 and 35; the “Bagatelles,” Op. 33, and (the chief\r\nwork of the year) the second Symphony, D major, Op. 36. The works\r\nwhich came from the press were the Pianoforte Sonatas, Op. 22, 26\r\nand 27, Nos. 1 and 2; the Serenade, Op. 25; the Septet, Op. 20; the\r\nQuintet, Op. 29; the Rondo in G, Op. 51, No. 2; the transcription for\r\nstrings of the Pianoforte Sonata in E, Op. 14, No. 1; the Variations\r\nfor Violoncello and Pianoforte on “Bei Männern welche Liebe fühlen,”\r\ndedicated to Count Browne; the six Contradances and six Rustic\r\n(“Ländrische”) Dances. There were thirteen performances of the ballet\r\n“Prometheus.” Moreover, it is at least remotely possible that the two\r\nlarge works which were played together with the Symphonies in C and D\r\nat Beethoven’s concert on April 5, 1803--viz.: the Pianoforte Concerto\r\nin C minor, Op. 37 and the Oratorio “Christus am Ölberg,” Op. 85--were\r\nnot so far advanced in all their parts that they, too, may have\r\noccupied the attention of Beethoven in the winter of 1802-03.\r\n\r\nFor nearly all the works completed in 1802, studies are to be found in\r\nthe sketchbook described in full by Nottebohm,[137] which covers the\r\nperiod from the fall of 1801 to the spring of 1802; like the majority\r\nof the sketchbooks, it contains themes and studies which were never\r\nworked out. “Overlooking the sketches which cross each other,” says\r\nNottebohm, “and putting aside all that is immaterial, the compositions\r\nrepresented in the book which were completed and are known, may be set\r\ndown chronologically as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Opferlied,” by Mathisson, first form.\r\n    Scene and Aria for Soprano: “No--non turbarti.”\r\n    Three of the Contradances.\r\n    Bagatelle for Pianoforte, No. 6 of Op. 33.\r\n    Last movement of the Symphony in D major.\r\n    Five of the six “Ländrische Tänze.”\r\n    Terzetto, “Tremate, empj, tremate,” Op. 116.\r\n    First and second movements of the Sonata for Pianoforte and Violin\r\n        in A major, Op. 30, No. 1.\r\n    Last movement of the Sonata for Pianoforte and Violin in A major,\r\n        Op. 47.\r\n    Sonata for Pianoforte and Violin in C minor, Op. 30, No. 2.\r\n    Bagatelle for Pianoforte, No. 5 of Op. 119 (112).\r\n    First movement of the Sonata for Pianoforte in D minor, Op. 31,\r\n        No. 2 (the first sketch only).\r\n    Sonata for Pianoforte and Violin in G major, Op. 30, No. 3.\r\n    Last movement of the Sonata for Pianoforte and Violin in A major,\r\n        Op. 30, No. 1 (the theme had been designed before).\r\n    Variations for Pianoforte in E-flat major, Op. 35 (preparatory\r\n        work).\r\n    Variations for Pianoforte in F major, Op. 34 (only the first hints).\r\n    Sonata for Pianoforte in G major, Op. 31, No. 1 (not complete).”\r\n\r\nTo which may be added as occurring early in the book, the theme of\r\nthe Larghetto of the Symphony in D (here for horns), out of which\r\neventually grew the Trio in the Scherzo. A curious remark on one of\r\nthe pages seems to be a memorandum for a piece of descriptive music:\r\n“Marital felicity, dark clouds upon the brow of the husband in which\r\nthe fairer half unites but still seeks to dispel.”\r\n\r\nThe evident care taken by the composer at this period to make the opus\r\nnumbers really correspond to the chronological order of his works,\r\nis a strong reason for concluding that the Violin Sonatas, Op. 30,\r\nwere completed or nearly so before he removed to Heiligenstadt. Even\r\nin that case, what wonderful genius and capacity for labor does it\r\nshow, that, before the close of the year, in spite of ill health and\r\nperiods of the deepest despondency, and of all the interruptions caused\r\nby his ordinary vocations after his return to town, he had completed\r\nthe first two Sonatas of Op. 31, the two extensive and novel sets of\r\nVariations, Op. 34 and Op. 35, and the noble Second Symphony!--all of\r\nthem witnesses that he had really “entered upon a new path,” neither of\r\nthem more so than the Symphony so amazingly superior to its predecessor\r\nin grandeur and originality. This was, in fact, the grand labor of this\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nTHE PIANOFORTE SONATAS, OP. 31\r\n\r\nThe three Sonatas for Pianoforte and Violin are dedicated to Czar\r\nAlexander I of Russia, who is said to have given command that a\r\nvaluable diamond ring be sent to the composer. Lenz could find no\r\nrecord of such an incident in the imperial archives. The sketches show\r\nthat the movement which now concludes the “Kreutzer” Sonata (Op. 47)\r\nwas originally designed for the first of the three, the one in A major;\r\nand that for the Adagio of the second, in C minor, Beethoven, assuming\r\nthat he already associated the theme with the work, first contemplated\r\nusing the key of G.\r\n\r\nThe three Sonatas for Pianoforte, Op. 31, are without dedication. W.\r\nNagel connects them, or one of them, with the following extraordinary\r\nletter to Hoffmeister:\r\n\r\n    Vienna, April 8, 1802.\r\n\r\n     Are you all ridden by the devil gentlemen that you propose _such a\r\n     sonata_ to me?\r\n\r\n     At the time of the revolutionary fever--well--such a thing might\r\n     have been very well; but now--when everything is trying to get\r\n     back into the old rut, Buonaparte has signed the concordat with\r\n     the Pope--such a sonata?\r\n\r\n     If it were a _Missa pro sancta Maria a tre voci_, or a Vesper,\r\n     etc.--I would take my brush in hand at once--and write down a\r\n     _Credo in unum Deum_ in big pound notes--but good God, such a\r\n     sonata--for these days of newly dawning Christianity--hoho!--leave\r\n     me out of it, nothing will come of it.\r\n\r\n     Now my answer in quickest tempo--the lady can have a sonata from\r\n     me, and I will follow her plan in respect of æsthetics in a\r\n     general way--and without following the keys--price 5 ducats--for\r\n     which she may keep it for her own enjoyment for a year, neither I\r\n     nor _she_ to publish it.\r\n\r\n     At the expiration of the year--the sonata will be mine to--i.\r\n     e., I shall publish it, and she shall have the privilege--if she\r\n     thinks it will be an honor--to ask me to dedicate it to her....\r\n\r\n     Now God keep you gentlemen.\r\n\r\n     My Sonata is beautifully printed [_gestochen_, i. e.,\r\n     engraved]--but it took you a pretty time--send my Septet into\r\n     the world a little quicker--for the crowd is waiting for it--and\r\n     you know the Empress has it and there are (scamps) in the\r\n     imperial city as well as the (imperial court) I can vouch for\r\n     nothing--therefore make haste.\r\n\r\n     Herr (Mollo) has again recently published my Quartets but full of\r\n     faults and _Errata_--in large as well as small form, they swarm in\r\n     them like fish in the sea, there is no end of them--_questo è un\r\n     piacere per un autore_--that’s pricking music with a vengeance,\r\n     in truth my skin is full of prickings and rips because of this\r\n     beautiful edition of my Quartets....\r\n\r\n     Now farewell and remember me as I do you. Till death your faithful\r\n\r\n    L. v. Beethoven.\r\n\r\nAn engagement which Beethoven had obtained from Count Browne for Ries\r\nwas one that gave him leisure to pursue his studies, and he often came\r\nto Vienna and Heiligenstadt for that purpose. Thus it happens that the\r\n“Notizen” also contribute to the history of these Sonatas. Ries writes:\r\n\r\n     Beethoven had promised the three solo sonatas (Op. 31) to Nägeli\r\n     in Zurich while his brother Carl (Caspar) who, unfortunately,\r\n     was always meddling with his affairs, wanted to sell them to a\r\n     Leipsic publisher. There were frequent exchanges of words between\r\n     the brothers on this account because Beethoven having given his\r\n     word wanted to keep it. When the sonatas (the first two) were\r\n     about to be sent away Beethoven was living in Heiligenstadt.\r\n     During a promenade new quarrels arose between the brothers and\r\n     finally they came to blows. The next day he gave me the sonatas\r\n     to send straight to Zurich, and a letter to his brother enclosed\r\n     in another to Stephan von Breuning who was to read it. A prettier\r\n     lesson could scarcely have been read by anybody with a good\r\n     heart than Beethoven read his brother on the subject of his\r\n     conduct on the day before. He first pointed it out in its true\r\n     and contemptible character, then he forgave him everything, but\r\n     predicted a bad future for him unless he mended his ways. The\r\n     letter, too, which he had written to Breuning was very beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe first two Sonatas (G major and D minor) appeared in the spring of\r\n1803, as Op. 29, in Nägeli’s “Répertoire des Clavecinistes” as _Cahier\r\n5_ (the third followed soon after as Op. 33, together with the “Sonate\r\npathétique” as _Cahier 11_). Of _Cahier 5_ Nägeli sent proof-sheets.\r\nRies reports on the subject as follows:\r\n\r\n     When the proof-sheets came I found Beethoven writing. “Play\r\n     the Sonata through,” he said to me, remaining seated at his\r\n     writing-desk. There was an unusual number of errors in the proofs,\r\n     which fact already made Beethoven impatient. At the end of the\r\n     first _Allegro_ in the Sonata in G major, however, Nägeli had\r\n     introduced four measures--after the fourth measure of the last\r\n     hold:\r\n\r\n     [Illustration]\r\n\r\n     When I played this Beethoven jumped up in a rage, came running to\r\n     me, half pushed me away from the pianoforte, shouting: “Where the\r\n     devil do you find that?” One can scarcely imagine his amazement\r\n     and rage when he saw the printed notes. I received the commission\r\n     to make a record of all the errors and at once send the sonatas to\r\n     Simrock in Bonn, who was to make a reprint and call it _Édition\r\n     très correcte_. In this place belong three notes to me:\r\n\r\n     1. “Be good enough to make a note of the errors and send a record\r\n     of them at once to Simrock, with the request that he publish as\r\n     soon as possible--day after to-morrow I will send him the sonata\r\n     and concerto.”\r\n\r\n     2. “I must beg you again to do the disagreeable work of making a\r\n     clear copy of the errors in the Zurich sonatas and sending it to\r\n     Simrock; you will find a list of the errors at my house in the\r\n     Wieden.”\r\n\r\n     3.\r\n\r\n    “Dear Ries!\r\n\r\n     “Not only are the expression marks poorly indicated but there are\r\n     also false notes in several places--therefore be careful!--or the\r\n     work will again be in vain. _Ch’à detto l’amato bene?_”\r\n\r\nThe closing words of the second note show that the matter was not\r\nbrought to an end until late in the spring of 1803, after Beethoven\r\nhad removed into the theatre buildings An-der-Wien. After the Sonatas\r\nbecame known in Vienna Doležalek asked Beethoven if a certain passage\r\nin the D minor Sonata was correct. “Certainly it is correct,” replied\r\nthe composer, “but you are a countryman of Krumpholz--nothing will go\r\ninto that hard Bohemian head of yours.”\r\n\r\nA circumstance related by Czerny, if accepted as authoritative, proves\r\nthat two of the three Sonatas were completed in the country. Once\r\nwhen he (Beethoven) saw a rider gallop past his windows in his summer\r\nsojourn in Heiligenstadt near Vienna, the regular beat (of the horse’s\r\nhoofs) gave him the idea for the theme of the Finale of the D minor\r\nsonata, Op. 31, No. 2:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe six Variations in F on an Original Theme, Op. 34, dedicated to\r\nthe Princess Odescalchi, were probably composed immediately after\r\nthe Variations in E-flat, Op. 35. In the midst of the sketches for\r\nthe latter (in the Kessler sketchbook) two measures of the theme are\r\nnoted and the remark appended, “Each variation in a different key--but\r\nalternately passages now in the left hand and then almost the same\r\nor different ones in the right.” The two sets of Variations and the\r\nQuintet, Op. 29, were sold to Breitkopf and Härtel in October, 1802. In\r\na letter which the publishers received from the composer on October 18,\r\n1802, Beethoven writes:\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF THE VARIATIONS\r\n\r\n     I have made two sets of Variations of which the first may be said\r\n     to number 8, the second 30; both are written in _a really entirely\r\n     new style_ and each in quite a different way. I should very much\r\n     like to have them published by you, but under the one condition\r\n     that the honorarium be about 50 florins for the two sets--do not\r\n     let me make this offer in vain, for I assure you you will never\r\n     regret the two works. Each theme in them is treated independently\r\n     and in a wholly different manner. As a rule I only hear of it\r\n     through others when I have new ideas, since I never know it\r\n     myself; but this time I can assure you myself that the style in\r\n     both works is new to me.\r\n\r\nA more interesting letter received by Breitkopf and Härtel on December\r\n26, 1802, relates to the same subject. It demands insertion in full:\r\n\r\n     Instead of the noise about a new method of V(ariations) such\r\n     as would be made by our neighbors the Gallo-Franks, like, for\r\n     instance, a certain Fr. composer who presents fugues _après une\r\n     nouvelle Méthode_, it consisting in this that the fugue is no\r\n     fugue, etc.--I nevertheless want to call attention to the fact\r\n     that these V. differ at least from others, and this I thought I\r\n     could do in the most unconstrained and least conspicuous manner\r\n     by means of the little prefatory note which I beg of you to print\r\n     in the small as well as the large V., leaving it for you to say\r\n     in what language or how many languages, since we poor Germans are\r\n     compelled to speak in all tongues.\r\n\r\n     Here is the prefatory note:\r\n\r\n     Inasmuch as these V. differ materially from my earlier ones I\r\n     have, instead of designating them merely by number, 1, 2, 3, etc.,\r\n     included them in the list of my _greater musical works_, and this\r\n     also for the further reason that the themes are original.\r\n\r\n    The author.\r\n\r\n     N.B. If you find it necessary to change or improve anything you\r\n     have my entire permission.\r\n\r\nThat by the “large variations,” whose number (30) Breitkopf and Härtel\r\nseem to have called in question, Beethoven meant his Op. 35, is made\r\nplain by a third letter running as follows:\r\n\r\n    Vienna, April 8, 1803.\r\n\r\n     I have wanted to write to you for a long time, but my business\r\n     affairs are so many that they permit but little correspondence.\r\n     You seem to be mistaken in your opinion that there are not as many\r\n     variations (as I stated) only it would not do to announce the\r\n     number as there is no way of telling how in the large set three\r\n     variations are run into each other in the Adagio, and the Fugue\r\n     can certainly not be called a variation, nor the Introduction,\r\n     which, as you may see for yourself, begins with the bass of\r\n     the theme, then expands to 2, 3 and finally 4 parts, when the\r\n     theme at last makes its appearance, which again cannot be called\r\n     a variation, etc.--but if this is not clear to you, send me\r\n     a proof-sheet along with the manuscript as soon as a copy is\r\n     printed, so that I may be guarded against confusion--you would do\r\n     me a great favor if you would omit from the large variations the\r\n     dedication to abbé Stadler and print the following, viz.: _dediées\r\n     etc. À Monsieur le Comte Maurice Lichnowsky_; he is a brother\r\n     of Prince Lichnowsky and only recently did me an unexpected\r\n     favor, and I have no other opportunity to return the kindness, if\r\n     you have already engraved the dedication to abbé Stadler I will\r\n     gladly pay the cost of changing the title-page, do not hesitate,\r\n     write what the expense will be and I will pay it with pleasure,\r\n     I earnestly beg you to do this if you have not sent out any\r\n     copies--in the case of the small variations the dedication to\r\n     Princess Odescalchi remains.\r\n\r\n     I thank you very much for the beautiful things of Sebastian\r\n     Bach’s, I will preserve and study them--should there be a\r\n     continuation of the pieces send them to me also--if you have a\r\n     good text for a cantata or other vocal piece send it to me.\r\n\r\nIn spite of Beethoven’s warning, Op. 34 was printed without the proof\r\nhaving been read by him; this provoked another letter calling attention\r\nto a large number of errors in the publication, of which Beethoven\r\npromised to send a list. He also expressed a fear that the “large\r\nvariations” would also be faulty, the more since his own manuscript\r\nhad been put into the hands of the engraver, and asked that the fact\r\nthat the theme was from his ballet “Prometheus” be indicated on the\r\ntitle-page, if there were still time, offering, as in the case of\r\nthe dedication, to pay the cost of the change. Again he begged to be\r\npermitted to correct a proof copy--a request which was ignored in this\r\ninstance, as it had been in the first. The result was a somewhat gentle\r\nprotest in another letter (October, 1803), in which Beethoven offered\r\nthe firm the Variations on “God save the King” and “Rule Britannia,”\r\nthe song “Wachtelschlag” and three Marches for the Pianoforte, four\r\nhands. The conclusion of the letter, with its postscript, has a double\r\nvalue--as an exhibition of Beethoven’s attitude towards the criticism\r\nof his day and as a contribution to the debated question touching the\r\nillicit printing of some of his early compositions. We quote:\r\n\r\n     Please thank the editor of the M.Z. (“Musikzeitung”) for his\r\n     kindness in giving place to the flattering report of my oratorio\r\n     in which there is so much rude lying about the prices which I\r\n     have made and I am so infamously treated, which is I suppose an\r\n     evidence of impartiality--for aught I care--so long as this makes\r\n     for the fortune of the M.Z.--what magnanimity is not asked of the\r\n     true artist, and not wholly without impropriety, but on the other\r\n     hand, what detestable and vulgar attacks upon us are permitted.\r\n\r\n     Answer immediately, and next time another topic.\r\n\r\n    As always your devoted\r\n\r\n    L. v. Beethoven.\r\n\r\n     N.B. All the pieces which I have offered you are entirely\r\n     new--since unfortunately so many unlucky old things of mine have\r\n     been sold and stolen.\r\n\r\nIt was through the printing of the letters to Breitkopf and Härtel\r\nthat the fact became known that Beethoven originally had intended\r\nto dedicate the Variations in E-flat to Abbé Stadler. The Rondo in\r\nG, which was announced by Hoffmeister and Kühnel on March 19, 1803,\r\nwas published in connection with the Rondo in C which had already\r\nappeared in 1798, as Op. 51, Nos. 1 and 2. It was originally dedicated\r\nto Countess Guicciardi, but Beethoven gave her the Sonata in C-sharp\r\nminor in exchange for it and inscribed the Rondo to Countess Henriette\r\nLichnowsky. This would seem to indicate that it was finished before\r\nthe Sonata, probably in 1801. Nottebohm has proved in his study of the\r\nKessler sketchbook that the sixth of the “Bagatelles,” in D major,\r\nhad its origin in 1802, when Beethoven was at work on the second\r\nSymphony.[138]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[128] The Sonata in E, Op. 14, No. 1, transposed to F major, was\r\npublished in 1802. See W. Altmann, “Ein vergessenes Streichquartett\r\nBeethovens,” “Die Musik,” 1905.\r\n\r\n[129] Those dedicated to Princess Esterhazy, Op. 45.\r\n\r\n[130] This Testament or Promemoria, written on a large foolscap sheet,\r\nappears to have been discovered in a mass of loose papers purchased\r\nby the elder Artaria at the sale of Beethoven’s effects in 1827.\r\nEndorsed upon it is an acknowledgement, signed by Jacob Hotschevar, the\r\nguardian (after Breuning’s death) of the composer’s nephew, of having\r\nreceived it from Artaria & Co. Then follows a similar acknowledgement\r\nof its reception by Johann van Beethoven. Its next possessor appears\r\nto have been Alois Fuchs--the great collector of musical manuscripts\r\nand autographs of musicians. In 1855, it was purchased by Ernst, the\r\nviolinist (of whom is not known?), who presented it to Mr. Otto and\r\nMadame Jenny Lind Goldschmidt as a testimony of gratitude for their\r\nvaluable assistance in one of his concerts. By their kindness the\r\npresent writer was allowed to make a very careful copy on April 2,\r\n1861. As printed in the “Allg. Musikalische Zeitung,” by Schindler and\r\nothers, it differs little from the original, though some of Beethoven’s\r\npeculiar forms of spelling were corrected--such as “Heiglnstadt.” “That\r\nBeethoven, throughout the document, never mentions the name of his\r\nsecond brother Johann, and indicates it only by points, is surprising\r\nand singular, inasmuch as this brother, as we have just seen, had come\r\nto Vienna only a short time before in order to take part in the affairs\r\nof our Beethoven.” Our copy certainly contains no such “points.” The\r\nother mistake, as to the recent arrival of Johann in Vienna, every\r\nreader will note.\r\n\r\n[131] The reference is, of course, to Artaria and Co. and the _Revers_.\r\n\r\n[132] Letter to Ferdinand Luib, May 28, 1852.\r\n\r\n[133] Under date April 22, 1802, Beethoven writes to Breitkopf\r\nand Härtel: “I reserve the privilege of soon writing to you\r\nhighborn gentlemen myself--many business matters, and also many\r\nvexations--render me utterly useless for some things for a\r\ntime--_meanwhile you may trust implicitly in my brother--who, in fact,\r\nmanages all my affairs_.”\r\n\r\n[134] Hugo Riemann, the editor of Volumes II and III of the second\r\nedition of this “Life,” was not disposed to permit the author’s defence\r\nof Beethoven’s brothers to stand unchallenged, as Dr. Deiters had\r\ndone in the first edition. Dr. Riemann calls attention to a letter\r\nsent by Beethoven to Johann after the latter had removed to Linz--the\r\ndate as written by Beethoven is “March 28, 1089”--another instance of\r\nBeethoven’s careless treatment of such matters. Of course the year was\r\n1809. In the letter the composer says: “God grant to you and the other\r\nbrother instead of his _unfeelingness, feeling--I suffer infinitely\r\nthrough him_, with my bad hearing I always need somebody, and whom\r\nshall I trust?” This Dr. Riemann inserts in the body of the text.\r\nIn a foot-note he calls attention to a letter found among Thayer’s\r\nposthumous papers to the author from Gerhard von Breuning in which\r\noccur the words: “Caspar held a respected position in the public\r\nservice. But how did it come that Rösgen warned my father to warn\r\nLudwig not to trust Caspar too much in respect of money matters because\r\nhe had a bad reputation; and then, Ludwig having told Caspar that he\r\nhad received the warning from Steffen, Caspar demanded from my father\r\nto know from whom he had received the warning; and when my father\r\nrefused because he had promised Rösgen on his word of honor not to\r\nbetray him, Caspar rudely pressed my father, publicly delivered letters\r\ncontaining abuse and threats to the porter of the Court Council of War,\r\netc., and--that my father, calling Ludwig a gossip, was long estranged\r\nfrom him until the letter of reconciliation came (in 1804).” Breuning’s\r\nutterances in his book “Aus dem Schwarzspanierhause” are of similar\r\nimport. There are evidences that Breuning was convinced that Carl’s\r\ncharacter was bad, but is more lenient in his judgment of Johann,\r\nwhom he charges only with greed and miserliness. Of course, all this\r\nmaterial was in the hands of Thayer, who must have weighed it in making\r\nup his defence of the brothers.\r\n\r\n[135] Dr. Frimmel is of the opinion that in this criticism Thayer was\r\nhasty and premature. In reproducing two _facsimiles_ of portions of the\r\nBagatelle in question (“Beethoven Jahrbuch” II, 1909) he says: “The\r\napparent contradictions disclosed by these manuscripts led Thayer to\r\nquestion the authenticity of the autograph. It may safely be said that\r\na later consideration of the matter would have led Thayer to change his\r\nmind; he would also surely have corrected his statement that Ries had\r\nreference to the Bagatelles Op. 33 in his ‘N’ (p. 124). Nottebohm knew\r\nthe manuscript, which was once in the possession of Johann Kafka, well\r\nand never expressed a doubt as to its genuineness.”\r\n\r\n[136] Difference between the statements made here and some of those in\r\nChapter VI are explained by the author’s later investigations.\r\n\r\n[137] “Ein Skizzenbuch von Beethoven,” Breitkopf und Härtel, Leipsic,\r\n1865.\r\n\r\n[138]\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN’S ESTIMATE OF THE BAGATELLES\r\n\r\nDr. Riemann thinks that Beethoven originally wrote “1802” on\r\nthe autograph, and that subsequently he, or somebody else, changed\r\nthe 8 into a 7 and the 0 into an 8. (See the _facsimile_ in Frimmel’s\r\n“Beethovenjahrbuch” of 1909); yet the German Editor finds suggestions\r\nof Beethoven’s latest style in the “Bagatelles” and calls attention to\r\nthe fact that Beethoven detected intimations of No. 5 in the set Op.\r\n119 in the Kessler sketchbook. Dr. Riemann’s conclusion is thus worded:\r\n“If Ries in his ‘Notizen’ meant these ‘Bagatelles’, he was surely in\r\nerror. Beethoven’s complaint to Breitkopf and Härtel in the letter of\r\nOctober, 1803, ‘since unfortunately so many unlucky old things of mine\r\nhave been sold and stolen,’ cannot possibly have referred to them.\r\nBeethoven himself thought highly of these ‘trifles’, as is shown by his\r\nanger at Peters’s depreciation of Op. 119. it is very likely that Ries\r\nmeant the Two Preludes in all the Keys (Op. 39), which may have been\r\nsurreptitiously published.”\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Note\r\n\r\n\r\nPage headers in the original text have been moved above the paragraph\r\nto which they relate.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe paragraph beginning “For my Brothers Carl” on p. 354 was printed\r\nvertically.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following printing errors have been corrected:\r\n\r\np. xx “Sympathethic” changed to “Sympathetic”\r\n\r\np. 24 “200 th.”” changed to “200 th.”\r\n\r\np. 70 (note) “_Variations” changed to ““_Variations”\r\n\r\np. 96 (note) “Beethoven’s mother.” changed to “Beethoven’s mother.””\r\n\r\np. 115 “the the hour” changed to “the hour”\r\n\r\np. 135 “bass”).” changed to “bass).””\r\n\r\np. 138 “pianofore” changed to “pianoforte”\r\n\r\np. 141 “these years” changed to “these years’”\r\n\r\np. 202 (note) “continally” changed to “continually”\r\n\r\np. 241 “Hadyn” changed to “Haydn”\r\n\r\np. 258 “neighboring page.” changed to “neighboring page.]”\r\n\r\np. 295 (header) “String Quartet” changed to “String Quintet”\r\n\r\np. 303 “familarly” changed to “familiarly”\r\n\r\np. 321 (note) ““_je la méprisois_” changed to ““_je la méprisois_””\r\n\r\np. 365 “(not complete).” changed to “(not complete).””\r\n\r\np. 368 ““Once when he” changed to “Once when he”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following possible errors have not been corrected:\r\n\r\np. 31 Schuster.\r\n\r\np. 57 (note) May 23. 1827.\r\n\r\np. 107 _Il Convivo_\r\n\r\np. 231 (for I am\r\n\r\np. 263 an opera--\r\n\r\n\r\nInconsistencies in spelling have otherwise been left as printed.
