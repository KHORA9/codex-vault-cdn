It has an area of 20,060 sq. m., or about two-thirds the size of\r\nScotland, and forms the principal province of the Austrian empire.\r\nSituated in the geographical centre of the European continent, at about\r\nequal distance from all the European seas, enclosed by high mountains,\r\nand nevertheless easily accessible through Moravia from the Danubian\r\nplain and opened by the valley of the Elbe to the German plain, Bohemia\r\nwas bound to play a leading part in the cultural development of Europe.\r\nIt became early the scene of important historical events, the avenue and\r\njunction of the migration of peoples; and it forms the borderland\r\nbetween the German and Slavonic worlds.\r\n\r\n_Geography._--Bohemia has the form of an irregular rhomb, of which the\r\nnorthernmost place, Buchberg, just above Hainspach, is at the same time\r\nthe farthest north in the whole Austro-Hungarian monarchy. From an\r\norographic point of view, Bohemia constitutes amongst the Austrian\r\nprovinces a separate massif, bordered on three sides by mountain ranges:\r\non the S.W. by the Bohmerwald or Bohemian Forest; on the N.W. by the\r\nErzgebirge or Ore Mountains; and on the N.E. by the Riesengebirge or\r\nGiant Mountains and other ranges of the Sudetes. The Bohmerwald, which,\r\nlike its parallel range, the Sudetes, has a general direction from S.E.\r\nto N.W., is divided by the pass of Neumark into two parts. The northern\r\npart (Czech _Cesky Les_) attains in the massif of Czerkov an altitude of\r\n3300 ft., but the southern part (Czech _Sumava_) is at the same time the\r\nhighest and the most picturesque part of the range, including on the\r\nBohemian side the Osser (4053 ft.) and the Plockenstein (4513 ft.),\r\nalthough the highest peak, the Arber (4872), is in Bavaria. The beauty\r\nof this range of mountains consists in its pure crystalline torrents, in\r\nthe numerous blue lakes of its valleys, and above all in the magnificent\r\nforests of oak and pine with which its sides are covered. The pass of\r\nNeumark, called also the pass of Neugedein, has always been the\r\nprincipal approach to Bohemia from Germany. It stretches towards the\r\neast, above the small town of Taus (Czech _Domazlice_, once called\r\n_Tuhost_, i.e. the Fortress), and is the place where some of the\r\nbloodiest battles in the history of Bohemia were fought. Here in the\r\nfirst half of the 7th century Samo repulsed the invading hordes of the\r\nAvars, which threatened the independence of the newly-settled Slavonic\r\ninhabitants; here also Wratislas II. defeated the German emperor Henry\r\nIII. in a two-days' battle (August 22 and 23, 1040). It was in the same\r\nplace that the Hussites gained in 1431 one of their greatest victories\r\nagainst a German army of crusaders, and another similar German army was\r\nvanquished here by George of Podebrad.\r\n\r\nThe Erzgebirge (Czech _Rudo Hori_), which form the north-west frontier,\r\nhave an average altitude of 2600 ft., and as their highest point, the\r\nKeilberg (4080 ft.). The numerous mining villages, the great number of\r\ncultivated areas and the easy passes, traversed by good roads, give\r\nthose mountains in many places the aspect of a hilly undulating plain.\r\nSeveral of the villages are built very near the summit of the mountains,\r\nand one of them, Gottesgab (pop. about 1500), lies at an altitude of\r\n3345 ft., the highest place in Bohemia and central Germany. To the west\r\nthe Erzgebirge combine through the Elstergebirge with the\r\nFichtelgebirge, which in their turn are united with the Bohmerwald\r\nthrough the plateau of Waldsassen. To the east the Erzgebirge are\r\nseparated from the Elbsandsteingebirge by the Nollendorf pass, traversed\r\nby the ancient military route to Saxony; it was the route followed by\r\nNapoleon I. after the battle of Dresden (1813). To the south stretches\r\nthe \"Thermopylae of Bohemia,\" the scene of the battle of Kulm and\r\nArbesau. A little farther to the east the Elbe escapes into Saxony at\r\nthe lowest point in Bohemia (alt. 367 ft.). The north-east frontier is\r\nformed by the Sudetes, which comprise the Lausitzergebirge (2500 ft.),\r\nthe Isergebirge (with the highest peak, the Tafelfichte, 3683 ft.), the\r\nJeschkengebirge (3322 ft.), and the Riesengebirge. The Riesengebirge\r\n(Czech _Kroknose_) are, after the Alps, among the highest mountains of\r\ncentral Europe, and attain in the Schneekoppe an altitude of 5264 ft.\r\nThe last groups of the Sudetes in Bohemia are the Heuscheuergebirge\r\n(2532 ft.) and the Adlergebirge (3664 ft.). The fourth side of the rhomb\r\nis formed by the so-called Bohemian-Moravian Hills, a plateau or broad\r\nseries of low hills, composed of primitive rocks, and attaining in some\r\nplaces an altitude of 2500 ft.\r\n\r\nThe interior of Bohemia has sometimes been compared to a deep basin; but\r\nfor the most part it is an undulating plateau, over 1000 ft. high,\r\nformed by a succession of terraces, which gradually slope down from\r\nsouth to north. Its lowest-lying points are not in the middle but in the\r\nnorth, in the valley of the Elbe, and the country can be divided into\r\ntwo parts by a line passing through Hohenmauth-Prague-Komotau. The part\r\nlying to the south of this line can be designated as highland, and only\r\nthe part north of it as lowland. The mountain-ranges of the interior of\r\nBohemia are the Brdywald (2798 ft.) in the middle; the Tepler Gebirge\r\n(2657 ft.), the Karsbader Gebirge (3057 ft.) and the Kaiserwald (3238\r\nft.), in the north-west part; while the northern corner is occupied by\r\nthe Mittelgebirge (2739 ft.), a volcanic massif, stretching on both\r\nsides of the Elbe.\r\n\r\nBohemia belongs to the watershed of the Elbe, which rises within the\r\nterritory and receives on the right the Iser and the Polzen, and on the\r\nleft the Adler; the Eger with its affluent the Tepl; the Biela and the\r\nMoldau. But the principal river of ~~ Bohemia, from every point of\r\nview, is the Moldau (Czech _Vltava_), not the Elbe. A glance at the\r\nhydrographic structure of Bohemia, which is of such a striking\r\nregularity, shows us that the Moldau is the main stem, while the Elbe\r\nand the other rivers are only lateral branches; moreover, the Elbe below\r\nMelnik, the point of its confluence with the Moldau, follows the general\r\ndirection of the Moldau. Besides, the Moldau is the principal commercial\r\nartery of the country, being navigable below Budweis, while the\r\nUpper-Elbe is not navigable; its basin (11,890 sq. m.) is twice as great\r\nas that of the Elbe, and its width and depth are also greater. It has a\r\nlength of 270 m., 47 m. longer than the Upper-Elbe, but it runs through\r\na deep and narrow valley, in which there is neither road nor railway,\r\nextending from above Budweis to about 15 m. south of Prague. The Moldau\r\nreceives on the right the Luzniza and the Sazawa and on the left the\r\nWottawa and the Beraun. The Beraun is formed by the union of the Mies\r\nwith the Radbusa, Angel and Uslawa, and is the third most important\r\nriver of the country. There are only a few lakes, which are mostly found\r\nat high altitudes.\r\n\r\n_Climate._--Bohemia has a continental, generally healthy climate, which\r\nvaries much in different parts of the country. It is mildest in the\r\ncentre, where, e.g. at Prague, the mean annual temperature is 48.5 deg.\r\nF. The rainfall varies also according to the districts, the rainy season\r\nbeing the summer. Thus the mean annual rainfall in the interior of\r\nBohemia is 18 in., in the Riesengebirge 40 in., while in the Bohmerwald\r\nit reaches 60 to 70 in.\r\n\r\n_Agriculture._--Favoured with a suitable climate and inhabited by a\r\nthriving rural population, Bohemia is very highly developed in the\r\nmatter of agriculture. Over 50% of the whole area is under cultivation\r\nand the soil is in many parts very fertile, the best-known regions being\r\nthe \"Golden Road\" round Koniggratz, the \"Paradise\" round Teplitz, and\r\nthe \"Garden of Bohemia\" round Leitmeritz. The principal products are\r\noats, rye, barley and wheat, but since the competition of Hungarian\r\nwheat large tracts of land have been converted to the cultivation of\r\nbeetroot. The potato crop, which forms the staple food of the people, is\r\ngreat; the Saaz district is celebrated for hops, and the flax is also of\r\na good quality. Fruit, especially plums, is very abundant and\r\nconstitutes a great article of export. The forests cover 29.01% of the\r\ntotal area; meadows, 10.05, pastures 5.05, and gardens 1.35%.\r\nCattle-rearing is not so well developed as agriculture, but great flocks\r\nof geese are reared, especially in the south, and bee-cultivation\r\nconstitutes another important industry. Pisciculture has been for\r\ncenturies successfully pursued by the Bohemian peasants, and the\r\nattempts recently made for the rearing of silkworms have met with fair\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n_Minerals_.--Except salt, which is entirely absent, almost every useful\r\nmetal and mineral is to be found. First in importance, both in quantity\r\nand in value, come lignite and coal. Some of the richest lignite fields\r\nin Europe are found in the north-east corner of Bohemia round Brux, Dux,\r\nFalkenau, Ossegg and Teplitz. Coal is mined round Kladno, Buschtehrad,\r\nPilsen, Schlan, Rakonitz, Nurschan and Radnitz, the last-named place\r\ncontaining the oldest coal mines of Bohemia (17th century). Iron ores\r\nare found at Krusnahora and Nucic, and the principal foundries are round\r\nKladno and Konigshof. Owing to the improvements in refining, Bohemia has\r\nbecome an important centre of the iron industry. Silver is extracted at\r\nPribram and Joachimsthal, but the silver mines near Kuttenberg, famous\r\nin the middle ages, are now abandoned. Lead is extracted at Pribram, tin\r\nat Graupen in the Erzgebirge, the only place in Austria where this metal\r\nis found. Antimony is extracted at Milleschau near Tabor; uranium and\r\nradium near Joachimsthal; graphite near Krumau and Budweis;\r\nporcelain-earth near Carlsbad. Other minerals found in various places of\r\nBohemia are copper, sulphur, cobalt, alum, nickel, arsenic and various\r\nsorts of precious stone, like the Bohemian garnet (pyrope), and building\r\nstone. A large amount of peat is collected, especially in the south-west\r\nof Bohemia, as well as a great quantity of asphalt.\r\n\r\nBohemia possesses over two hundred mineral springs, but only a few are\r\nused for medicinal purposes. Among them are some of the most celebrated\r\nmineral springs in the world, such as Carlsbad, Marienbad, Franzensbad,\r\nTeplitz-Schonau and Bilin. Other springs of importance are Pullna,\r\nSedlitz and Seidschitz near Brux; Giesshubl near Carlsbad; Liebwerda,\r\nKonigswart, Sangerberg, Neudorf, Tetschen, Johannisbad, situated at the\r\nfoot of the Schneekoppe, &c.\r\n\r\n_Manufactures and Commerce._--From an industrial point of view, Bohemia\r\ntakes the first rank amongst the Austrian provinces, and at the same\r\ntime is one of the greatest manufacturing centres of Europe. Rich as the\r\ncountry is in coal and iron, and in water supplies which can be\r\ntransformed into motive power, the inhabitants were not slow to utilize\r\nthese advantages, so that the industry of Bohemia made enormous strides\r\nduring the last half of the 19th century. The glass industry was\r\nintroduced from Venice in the 13th century and soon attained a vast\r\nimportance; the factories are in the neighbourhood of the mountains,\r\nwhere minerals, and especially silica and fuel, are plentiful. The\r\nfinest product, the crystal-glass, is made round Haida and Steinschonau.\r\nThe very extensive porcelain industry is concentrated in and around\r\nCarlsbad. The textile industry stands in the front rank and is mostly\r\nconcentrated in the north-east corner of Bohemia, round Reichenberg, and\r\nin the valley of the Lower Elbe. The cloth manufacture is located at\r\nReichenberg; Rumburg and Trautenau are the centre of the linen industry;\r\nwoollen yarns are made at Aussig and Asch. Lace, which is pursued as a\r\nhome-industry in the Erzgebirge region, has its principal centre at\r\nWeipert, while Strakonitz has the speciality of the manufacture of red\r\nfezes (Turkish caps). The metallurgic industries, favoured by the\r\nabundance of coal and iron, are concentrated round the mines. Industrial\r\nand agricultural machinery are manufactured at Reichenberg, Pilsen and\r\nPrague, and at the last-named place is also to be found a great\r\nestablishment for the production of railway rolling-stock. Sugar\r\nrefining is another industry, which, although of recent date, has had a\r\nvery great development, and the breweries produce a beer which is\r\nappreciated all over the world. Other important branches of industry\r\nare:--the manufacture of chemicals at Prague and Aussig; pencils at\r\nBudweis; musical instruments at Graslitz and Schonbach; paper, leather,\r\ndyeing and calico-printing. Hand-in-hand with the industrial activity of\r\nthe country goes its commercial development, which is stimulated by an\r\nextensive railway system, good roads and navigable rivers. The centre of\r\nthe railway system, which had in 1898 a length of some 3500 m., or 30%\r\nof the total length of the Austrian railways, is Prague; and through the\r\nElbe Bohemia has easy access to the sea for its export trade.\r\n\r\n_Population and Administration._--Bohemia had in 1900 a population of\r\n6,318,280, which corresponds to 315 inhabitants per square mile. As\r\nregards numbers, it occupies the second place amongst the Austrian\r\nprovinces, coming after Galicia, and as regards density of population it\r\nstands third, Silesia and Lower Austria, which contains Vienna, standing\r\nhigher. In 1800 the population was a little over 3,000,000. According to\r\nnationality, about 35% are Germans and 65% Czechs. The Czechs occupy the\r\nmiddle of the country, as well as its south and south-east region, while\r\nthe Germans are concentrated near its borders, especially in the north\r\nand west, and are also found all over the country in the large towns.\r\nBesides, there are numerous German-speaking enclaves situated in purely\r\nCzech districts; on the other hand, the Czechs have shown a tendency to\r\ninvade the purely German mining and manufacturing districts.\r\nNotwithstanding its rich natural resources and its great industrial\r\ndevelopment, Bohemia sends out a steady flow of emigrants, who either\r\nsettle in the other provinces of the monarchy, in Germany and in Russia,\r\nor cross the Atlantic to America. To the Roman Catholic Church belong\r\n96% of the total population; Bohemia is divided into the archbishopric\r\nof Prague, and the three bishoprics of Budweis, Koniggratz and\r\nLeitmeritz.\r\n\r\nEducation is well advanced, and Bohemia has the lowest proportion of\r\nilliterates amongst the Austrian provinces. At the head of the\r\neducational establishments stand the two universities at Prague, one\r\nGerman and the other Czech.\r\n\r\nBohemia sends 130 deputies to the Reichsrat at Vienna; the local diet,\r\nto which belong _ex officio_ the archbishop, the three bishops, and the\r\ntwo rectors of the universities, consists of 242 members. For\r\nadministrative purposes Bohemia is divided into ninety-four districts\r\nand two autonomous municipalities, Prague (pop. 204,478), the capital,\r\nand Reichenberg (34,204). Other important towns are Pilsen (68,292),\r\nBudweis (39,360), Aussig (37,255), Schonau (24,110), Eger (23,665),\r\nWarnsdorf (21,150), Brux (21,525), Gablonz (21,086), Asch (18,675),\r\nKladno (18,600), Pardubitz (17,029), Saaz (16,168), Komotau (15,925),\r\nKolin (15,025), Kuttenberg (14,799), Trautenau (14,777), Carlsbad\r\n(14,640), Pribram (13,576), Jungbunzlau (13,479), Leitmeritz (13,075),\r\nChrudim (13,017), Dux (11,921), Bodenbach (10,782), Tabor (10,692),\r\nBohmisch-Leipa (10,674), Rumburg (10,382), Weipert (10,037).\r\n\r\n  See F.

Br.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\n\r\n  Slav Conquest.\r\n\r\nThe country derives its name from the Boii, a Celtic tribe which in the\r\nearliest historical period inhabited part of the land. According to very\r\nancient traditions accepted by the modern historians of Bohemia, the\r\nBoii, whose capital was called Boiohemum, were weakened by continual\r\nwarfare with neighbouring tribes, and finally subdued by the Teutonic\r\ntribe of the Marcomanni (about 12 B.C.). The Marcomanni were afterwards\r\nexpelled by other Teutonic tribes, and eventually Bohemia was conquered\r\nby Slavic tribes, of whom the Cechs (see CZECH) were the most important.\r\nThe date of the arrival of the Cechs in Bohemia is very uncertain, and\r\nthe scanty references to the country in classical and Byzantine writers\r\nare rather misleading than otherwise. Recent archaeological research has\r\nproved the existence of Slavic inhabitants in Bohemia as far back as the\r\nbeginning of the Christian era. The Cechs appear to have become the\r\nmasters of the country in the 5th century. The first of their rulers\r\nmentioned in history is Samo, who is stated to have defeated the Avars,\r\na Turanian tribe which had for a time obtained the overlordship over\r\nBohemia. Samo also defeated the Franks in a great battle that took place\r\nat Wogatisburg (630), probably near the site of the present town of\r\nEger. After the death of Samo the history of Bohemia again becomes\r\nabsolutely obscure for about 130 years. The next events that are\r\nrecorded by the oldest chroniclers, such as Cosmas, refer to the\r\nfoundation of a Bohemian principality by Krok (or Crocus) and his\r\ndaughter Libussa. The latter is said to have married Premysl, a peasant\r\nwho was found ploughing his field--a legend that is common in most\r\nSlavic countries. Beginning with this semi-mythic ruler, the ancient\r\nchroniclers have constructed a continuous list of Premyslide princes.\r\nNeither the deeds attributed to these princes nor the dates of their\r\nreigns can be considered as historical.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Christianity.\r\n\r\n  Wenceslas\r\n\r\n  Boleslav.\r\n\r\n  Vladivoj.\r\n\r\n  Bretislav I.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the introduction of Christianity into Bohemia the\r\nhistory of the country becomes less obscure. The first attempts to\r\nintroduce Christianity undoubtedly came from Germany. They met with\r\nlittle success, as innate distrust of the Germans naturally rendered the\r\nBohemians unfavourable to a creed which reached them from the realm of\r\ntheir western neighbours. Matters were different when Christianity\r\napproached them from Moravia, where its doctrine had been taught by\r\nCyrillus and Methodius--Greek monks from Thessalonica. About the year\r\n873 the Bohemian prince Borivoj was baptized by Methodius, and the\r\nBohemians now rapidly adopted the Christian faith. Of the rulers of\r\nBohemia the most famous at this period was Wenceslas, surnamed the Holy,\r\nwho in 935 was murdered by his brother Boleslav, and who was afterwards\r\ncanonized by the Church of Rome. As Wenceslas had been an ally of\r\nGermany, his murder resulted in a war with that country, in which, as\r\nfar as we can judge by the scanty records of the time. Boleslav, the\r\nbrother and successor of Wenceslas, was on the whole successful. During\r\nthe reigns of Boleslav and his son, Boleslav II., Bohemia extended its\r\nfrontiers in several directions. Boleslav II. indeed established his\r\nrule not only over Bohemia and Moravia, but also over a large part of\r\nSilesia, and over that part of Poland which is now the Austrian province\r\nof Galicia. Like most Slavic states at this and even a later period, the\r\ngreat Bohemian empire of Boleslav II. did not endure long. Boleslav\r\nIII., son of Boleslav II., lost all his foreign possessions to Boleslav\r\nthe Great, king of Poland. During his reign Bohemia was involved in\r\nconstant civil war, caused by the dissensions between Boleslav III. and\r\nhis brothers Jaromir and Ulrick. Though the prince succeeded in\r\nexpelling his brothers from the country, his cruelty induced the\r\nBohemians to dethrone him and to choose as their ruler the Polish prince\r\nVladivoj. Vladivoj, brother of Boleslav the Great, and son of the\r\nBohemian princess Dubravka (Dobrawa). Vladivoj attempted to strengthen\r\nhis hold over Bohemia by securing the aid of Germany. He consented not\r\nonly to continue to pay the tribute which the Germans had already\r\nobtained from several previous rulers of Bohemia, but also to become a\r\nvassal of the German empire and to receive the German title of duke.\r\nThis state continued when after the death of Vladivoj the Premyslide\r\ndynasty was restored. The Premyslide prince Bretislav I (1037-1055)\r\nrestored the former power of Bohemia, and again added Moravia, Silesia\r\nand a considerable part of Poland to the Bohemian dominions. To obviate\r\nthe incessant struggles which had endangered the land at every vacancy\r\nof the throne, Bretislav, with the consent of the nobles, decreed that\r\nthe oldest member of the house of Premysl should be the ruler of\r\nBohemia. Bretislav was therefore succeeded first by his eldest son\r\nSpitihnev, and then by his second son Vratislav.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Vratislav becomes \"king\".\r\n\r\nIn 1088 Vratislav obtained the title of king from the emperor Henry IV.,\r\nwhom he had assisted in the struggle with the papal see which is known\r\nas the contest about investitures. Though the title of king was only\r\nconferred on Vratislav personally, the German king, Conrad III.,\r\nconferred on the Bohemian prince Sobeslav (1125-1140) the title of\r\nhereditary cupbearer of the Empire, thus granting a certain influence on\r\nthe election of the emperors to Bohemia, which hitherto had only\r\nobligations towards the Empire but no part in its government. In 1156\r\nthe emperor Frederick I. Barbarossa ceded Upper Lusatia to the Bohemian\r\nprince Vladislav II., and conferred on him the title of king on\r\ncondition of his taking part in Frederick's Italian campaigns. It was\r\nintended that that title should henceforth be hereditary, but it again\r\nfell into abeyance during the struggles between the Premyslide princes\r\nwhich followed the abdication of Vladislav in 1173.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ottakar II.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of these constant internal struggles were twofold; the\r\nGerman influence became stronger, and the power of the sovereign\r\ndeclined, as the nobility on whose support the competitors for the crown\r\nwere obliged to rely constantly obtained new privileges. In 1197 Premysl\r\nOttakar became undisputed ruler of Bohemia, and he was crowned as king\r\nin the following year. The royal title of the Bohemian sovereigns was\r\ncontinued uninterruptedly from that date. Wenceslas I. (1230-1253)\r\nsucceeded his father as king of Bohemia without opposition. The last\r\nyears of his reign were troubled by internal discord. Wenceslas's son,\r\nPremysl Ottakar II., who under the sovereignty of his father ruled\r\nMoravia, became for a time the chief leader of the malcontents. A\r\nreconciliation between son and father, however, took place before the\r\nlatter's death. Premysl Ottakar II. was one of the greatest of Bohemia's\r\nkings. He had during the lifetime of his father obtained possession of\r\nthe archduchies of Austria, and, about the time of his accession to the\r\nBohemian throne, the nobility of Styria also recognized him as their\r\nruler. These extensions of his dominions involved Premysl Ottakar II. in\r\nrepeated wars with Hungary. In 1260 he decisively defeated Bela, king of\r\nHungary, in the great battle of Kressenbrunn. After this victory\r\nOttakar's power rose to its greatest height. He now obtained possession\r\nof Carinthia, Istria and parts of northern Italy. His possessions\r\nextended from the Giant Mountains in Bohemia to the Adriatic, and\r\nincluded almost all the parts of the present Habsburg empire west of the\r\nLeitha. His contemporaries called Ottakar \"the man of gold\" because of\r\nhis great wealth, or \"the man of iron\" because of his military power.\r\nFrom political rather than racial causes Ottakar favoured the\r\nimmigration of Germans into his dominions. He hoped to find in the\r\nGerman townsmen a counterpoise to the overwhelming power of the Bohemian\r\nnobility. In 1273 Rudolph, count of Habsburg, was elected king of the\r\nRomans. It is very probable that the German crown had previously been\r\noffered to Ottakar, but that he had refused it. Several causes, among\r\nothers his Slavic nationality, which was likely to render him obnoxious\r\nto the Germans, contributed to his decision. As Rudolph immediately\r\nclaimed as vacant fiefs of the Empire most of the lands held by Ottakar,\r\nwar was inevitable. Ottakar was deserted by many of his new subjects,\r\nand even by part of the Bohemian nobility. He was therefore unable to\r\nresist the German king, and was obliged to surrender to him all his\r\nlands except Bohemia and Moravia, and to recognize Rudolph as his\r\noverlord. New dissensions between the two sovereigns broke out almost\r\nimmediately. In 1278 Ottakar invaded the Austrian duchies, now under the\r\nrule of Rudolph, but was defeated and killed at the battle of Durnkrut\r\non the Marchfeld.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Wenceslas II.\r\n\r\nOttakar's son, Wenceslas II., was only seven years of age at the death\r\nof his father, and Otto of Brandenburg, a nephew of Ottakar, for a time\r\ngoverned Bohemia as guardian of the young sovereign. Otto's rule was\r\nvery unpopular, an insurrection broke out against him, and Bohemia was\r\nfor a time in a state of complete anarchy. The country was at last\r\npacified through the intervention of Rudolph of Habsburg, and at the age\r\nof twelve Wenceslas became nominal ruler of the country. All power was,\r\nhowever, in the hands of Zavis of Falkenstein, one of the great Bohemian\r\nnobles, who had married the king's mother, Kunegunda. The power of Zavis\r\nat last became invidious to the king, by whose order he was beheaded in\r\n1290. Wenceslas, though only nineteen years of age, henceforth governed\r\nBohemia himself, and his short reign was a period of great happiness for\r\nthe country. Poland also accepted the rule of Wenceslas and the\r\nHungarian crown was offered to him. Towards the end of his reign\r\nWenceslas became involved in war with Albert, archduke of Austria,\r\nafterwards king of the Romans. While preparing to invade Austria\r\nWenceslas died suddenly (1305). His son and successor, Wenceslas III.,\r\nwas then only sixteen years of age, and he only ruled over Bohemia for\r\none year. While planning a warlike expedition against Poland, on which\r\ncountry the Bohemian sovereigns now again maintained their claim, he was\r\nmurdered by unknown assassins (1306). With him ended the rule of the\r\nPremyslide dynasty over Bohemia.\r\n\r\n\r\n  John of Luxemburg.\r\n\r\nAlbert, king of the Romans, declared that Bohemia was a vacant fief of\r\nthe Empire, and, mainly by intimidation, induced the Bohemians to elect\r\nhis son Rudolph as their sovereign; but Rudolph died after a reign of\r\nonly one year. Though the Habsburg princes at this period already\r\nclaimed a hereditary right to the Bohemian throne, the Bohemians\r\ndetermined to maintain their right of electing their sovereign, and they\r\nchose Henry, duke of Carinthia, who had married a daughter of King\r\nWenceslas II. Henry soon became unpopular, as he was accused of unduly\r\nfavouring the German settlers in Bohemia. It was decided to depose him,\r\nand the choice of the Bohemians now fell on John of Luxemburg, son of\r\nHenry, king of the Romans. The Luxemburg dynasty henceforth ruled over\r\nBohemia up to the time of its extinction at the death of Sigismund\r\n(1437). Though King John, by his marriage to the princess Elizabeth, a\r\ndaughter of Wenceslas II., became more closely connected with Bohemia,\r\nhe does not appear to have felt much interest in that country. Most of\r\nhis life was spent in other lands, his campaigns ranging from Italy in\r\nthe south to Lithuania in the north. It became proverbial \"that nothing\r\ncould be done in the world without the help of God and of the king of\r\nBohemia.\" The policy of John was founded on a close alliance with\r\nFrance, the country for which he felt most sympathy. Fighting as an ally\r\nof France he fell at the battle of Crecy (1346).\r\n\r\n\r\n  King Charles.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded as king of Bohemia by his son Charles, whom the German\r\nelectors had previously elected as their sovereign at Rense (1346).\r\nCharles proved one of the greatest rulers of Bohemia, where his memory\r\nis still revered. Prague was his favourite residence, and by the\r\nfoundation of the nove mesto (new town) he greatly enlarged the city,\r\nwhich now had three times its former extent, and soon also trebled its\r\npopulation. He also added greatly to the importance of the city by\r\nfounding the famous university of Prague. Charles succeeded in\r\nre-establishing order in Bohemia. The country had been in a very\r\ndisturbed state in consequence of feuds that were incessant during the\r\nreign of John, who had almost always been absent from Bohemia. Charles\r\nalso attempted to codify the obscure and contradictory laws of Bohemia;\r\nbut this attempt failed through the resistance of the powerful nobility\r\nof the country. During the reign of Charles, the first symptoms of that\r\nmovement in favour of church reform that afterwards acquired a\r\nworld-wide importance, appeared in Bohemia. As Charles has often been\r\naccused of undue subserviency to the Church of Rome, it should be\r\nmentioned that he granted his protection to several priests who favoured\r\nthe cause of church reform. In his foreign policy Charles differed from\r\nhis father. The relations with France gradually became colder, and at\r\nthe end of his reign Charles favoured an alliance with England; he died\r\nin 1378 at the age of sixty-two, prematurely exhausted by arduous work.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Wenceslas IV.\r\n\r\nCharles was succeeded by his son Wenceslas, who was then seventeen years\r\nof age. His reign marks the decline of the rule of the house of\r\nLuxemburg over Bohemia. He was a weak and incapable sovereign, but the\r\nvery exaggerated accusations against him, which are found principally in\r\nthe works of older historians, are mainly due to the fact that the king\r\nand to a larger extent his queen, Sophia, for a time furthered the cause\r\nof church reform, thus incurring the displeasure of Romanist writers.\r\nDuring the earlier part of the reign of Wenceslas a continual struggle\r\ntook place between the king and the powerful Bohemian nobles, who indeed\r\ntwice imprisoned their sovereign. Wenceslas also became involved in a\r\ndispute with the archbishop, which resulted in the death of the famous\r\nJohn of Nepomuk.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Huss and the Hussites\r\n\r\nThe later part of the reign of Wenceslas is a record of incipient\r\nreligious conflict. The hold of the Church of Rome on Bohemia had\r\nalready been weakened during the reign of King Charles by attacks on the\r\nimmorality of the clergy, which proceeded from pious priests such as\r\nMilic and Waldhauser. The church schism, during which the rival pontiffs\r\nassailed each other with all the wild threats and objurgations of\r\nmedieval theological strife, necessarily alienated the Bohemians to a\r\nyet greater extent. Almost the whole Bohemian nation therefore espoused\r\nthe cause of Huss (q.v.). Wenceslas on the occasion of these disputes\r\ndisplayed the weakness and irresolution that always characterized him,\r\nbut Queen Sophia openly favoured the cause of Huss, who for some time\r\nwas her confessor. Huss was tried before the council of Constance\r\n(q.v.), to which he had proceeded with a letter of safe conduct given\r\nby Wenceslas's brother Sigismund, king of the Romans. He was declared a\r\nheretic and burnt on the 6th of July 1415. The inevitable and immediate\r\nresult of this event was the outbreak of civil war in Bohemia, where\r\nHuss was greatly revered by the large majority of the population. The\r\nnobles of Bohemia and Moravia met at Prague on the 2nd of September\r\n1415, and sent to the council the famed _Protestatio Bohemorum_, in\r\nwhich they strongly protested against the execution of Huss, \"a good,\r\njust and catholic man who had for many years been favourably known in\r\nthe Kingdom by his life, conduct and fame, and who had been convicted of\r\nno offence.\" They further declared that all who affirmed that heresy\r\nexisted in Bohemia were \"liars, vile traitors and calumniators of\r\nBohemia and Moravia, the worst of all heretics, full of all evil, sons\r\nof the devil.\" They finally stated \"that they would defend the law of\r\nour Lord Jesus Christ and its pious, humble and steadfast preachers at\r\nthe cost of their blood, scorning all fear and all human decrees that\r\nmight be contrary to them.\"[2] This protest was a declaration of war\r\nagainst the Roman church, and marks the beginning of the Hussite wars.\r\nThe council, indeed, summoned the nobles before its tribunal, but they\r\nrefused to appear. A large number of the nobles and knights who had met\r\nat Prague formed a confederacy and declared that they consented to\r\nfreedom of preaching the word of God on their estates, that they\r\ndeclined to recognize the authority of the council of Constance, but\r\nwould obey the Bohemian bishops and a future pope lawfully elected.\r\nMeanwhile they declared the university of Prague the supreme authority\r\nin all matters of religion. The members of the confederacy attempted,\r\nthough unsuccessfully, to induce King Wenceslas to become their leader.\r\nThe Romanist nobles, who were not numerous, but some of whom owned vast\r\nestates, now also formed a confederacy, pledging themselves to support\r\nthe pope and the council. After the closing of the council in 1418,\r\nSigismund, who--Wenceslas being childless--was heir to the Bohemian\r\nthrone, sent a letter to his brother, which was practically a manifesto\r\naddressed to the Bohemian people. He threatened with the severest\r\npenalties all who should continue to resist the authority of Rome.\r\nWenceslas maintained the vacillating attitude that was characteristic of\r\nhis whole reign, though Queen Sophia still extended her protection to\r\nthe reformers. By doing this, indeed, she incurred the wrath of the\r\nChurch to so great an extent that an act of accusation against her was\r\ndrawn up at the council of Constance. Intimidated by his brother,\r\nWenceslas now attempted to stem the current of religious enthusiasm.\r\nImmediately after the death of Huss many priests who refused to\r\nadminister communion in the two kinds--now the principal tenet of the\r\nadherents of Huss--had been expelled from their parishes. Wenceslas\r\ndecreed that they should be reinstated, and it was only after some\r\nhesitation that he even permitted that religious services according to\r\nthe Utraquist doctrine should be held in three of the churches of\r\nPrague. Some of the more advanced reformers left Prague and formed the\r\nparty known as the Taborites, from the town of Tabor which became their\r\ncentre. Troubles soon broke out at Prague. When on the 30th of July\r\n1419, the Hussite priest, John of Zelivo, was leading a procession\r\nthrough the streets of Prague, stones were thrown at him and his\r\nfollowers from the town hall of the \"new town.\" The Hussites, led by\r\nJohn Zizka (q.v.), stormed the town-hall and threw the magistrates from\r\nits windows. On receiving the news of these riots King Wenceslas was\r\nimmediately seized by an attack of apoplexy; a second fit on the 16th of\r\nAugust ended his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sigismund.\r\n\r\nThe news of the death of the king caused renewed rioting in Prague and\r\nmany other Bohemian cities, from which many Germans, mostly adherents of\r\nthe Church of Rome, were expelled. Finally a temporary truce was\r\nconcluded, and, early in the following year, Sigismund, who now claimed\r\nthe Bohemian crown as successor of his brother, arrived at Kutna Hora\r\n(Kuttenberg). Pope Martin V. on the 1st of March 1420 proclaimed a\r\ncrusade against Bohemia, and crusaders from all parts of Europe joined\r\nSigismund's army. \"On the 30th day of June the Hungarian king,\r\nSigismund, with a large army consisting of men of various countries, as\r\nwell as of Bohemians, occupied the castle of Prague, determined to\r\nconquer the city, which they considered a heretical community because\r\nthey used the sacred chalice and accepted other evangelical truths.\"[3]\r\nBut the attempt of the crusaders to conquer Prague failed, and after an\r\nattack by them on the Vitkov (now Zizkov) hill had been repulsed by the\r\ndesperate bravery of the Taborites, led by Zizka, Sigismund determined\r\nto abandon the siege of Prague. An attempt of Sigismund to relieve the\r\nbesieged garrison of the Vysehrad fortress on the outskirts of Prague\r\nalso failed, as he was again entirely defeated at the battle of the\r\nVysehrad (November 1, 1420).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Religious War.\r\n\r\nRoyal authority now ceased in Bohemia. At a meeting of the diet at\r\nCaslav (June 1, 1421) Sigismund was deposed. It was decided that a\r\nPolish prince should be chosen as sovereign, and that meanwhile a\r\nprovisional government, composed of twenty men belonging to the various\r\nparties, should be established. In 1422 Sigismund again invaded Bohemia,\r\nbut was decisively defeated by Zizka at Nemecky Brod (Deutschbrod). The\r\nPolish prince, Sigismund Korybutovic, now arrived in Bohemia, and was\r\nrecognized as regent by the large majority of the inhabitants; but\r\nthrough the influence of the papal see he was recalled by the rulers of\r\nPoland after a stay of only a few months. After his departure, civil war\r\nbetween the moderate Hussites (Calixtines or Utraquists) and the\r\nadvanced Taborite party broke out for the first time, though there had\r\npreviously been isolated disturbances between them. The return of Prince\r\nKorybutovic and the menace of a German invasion soon reunited the\r\nBohemians, who gained a decisive victory over the Germans at Aussig in\r\n1426. Shortly afterwards Korybutovic, who had taken part in this great\r\nvictory, incurred the dislike of the extreme Hussites, and was obliged\r\nto leave Bohemia. All hope of establishing an independent Slav dynasty\r\nin Bohemia thus came to an end. In 1427 several German princes undertook\r\na new crusade against the Hussites. With the German and other invaders\r\nwere 1000 English archers, bodyguard to Henry Beaufort, bishop of\r\nWinchester, who took part in the crusade as papal legate. The crusaders\r\nwere seized by a sudden panic, both at Mies (Stribro) and at Tachau, as\r\nsoon as they approached the Hussites, and they fled hurriedly across the\r\nmountains into Bavaria. Though internal disturbances again broke out,\r\nthe Bohemians after this success assumed the offensive, and repeatedly\r\ninvaded Hungary and the German states.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The \"Compacts.\"\r\n\r\nThe impossibility of conquering Bohemia had now become obvious, and it\r\nwas resolved that a council should meet at Basel (q.v.) to examine the\r\ndemands of the Hussites. The Germans, however, influenced by Sigismund,\r\ndetermined to make a last attempt to subdue Bohemia by armed force. The\r\nBohemians, as usual united in the moment of peril, defeated the Germans\r\nat Domazlice (Taus) on the 1st of August 1431, after a very short fight.\r\nIn the course of the same year negotiations began at Basel, the Hussites\r\nbeing represented by a numerous embassy under the leadership of Prokop\r\nthe Great. The negotiations proceeded very slowly, and in 1433 the\r\nBohemians returned to their own country, accompanied, however, by envoys\r\nof the council. Dissensions had meanwhile again broken out in Bohemia,\r\nand they were now of a political rather than a religious nature. The\r\nmore aristocratic Hussites raised an armed force which was known as \"the\r\narmy of the nobles.\" The Taborites also collected their men, who formed\r\n\"the army of the towns.\" The two armies met at Lipan, near Kolin, on the\r\n30th of May 1434. The Taborites were defeated, and the two Prokops and\r\nmost of their other leaders perished on the battlefield. The victory of\r\nthe moderate party paved the way to a reconciliation with Sigismund and\r\nthe Church of Rome. The Bohemians recognized Sigismund as their\r\nsovereign, but obtained considerable concessions with regard to\r\nreligious matters. These concessions, which were formulated in the\r\nso-called Compacts, granted to the Bohemians the right of communion in\r\nboth kinds, and of preaching the gospel freely, and also to a certain\r\nextent limited the power of the clergy to acquire worldly goods.\r\n\r\nAfter the Compacts had been formally recognized at Iglau in Moravia,\r\nSigismund proceeded to Prague and was accepted as king. He died in the\r\nfollowing year (1437) and was succeeded by his son-in-law, Albert of\r\nAustria, whom the estates chose as their king. Albert died after he had\r\nreigned over Bohemia less than two years. Though it was known that\r\nAlbert's widow Elizabeth would shortly give birth to a child, the\r\nquestion as to the succession to the throne again arose; for it was\r\nonly in 1627 that the question whether the Bohemian crown was elective\r\nor hereditary was decided for ever. The nobles formed two parties, one\r\nof which, the national one, had George of Podebrad (q.v.) as its leader.\r\nUlrich of Rosenberg was the leader of the Roman or Austrian division of\r\nthe nobility. The two parties finally came to an agreement known as the\r\n\"Letter of Peace\" (_list mirny_). Those who signed it pledged themselves\r\nto recognise the Compacts, and to support as archbishop of Prague, John\r\nof Rokycan, who had been chosen by the estates in accordance with an\r\nagreement made simultaneously with the Compacts, but whom the Church of\r\nRome refused to recognize. On the other hand, the national party\r\nabandoned the candidature to the throne of Prince Casimir of Poland,\r\nthus paving the way to the eventual succession of Albert's heir. On the\r\n22nd of February 1440 Queen Elizabeth gave birth to a son, who received\r\nthe name of Ladislas. The Bohemians formally acknowledged him as their\r\nking, though only after their crown had been declined by Albert, duke of\r\nBavaria. Ladislas remained in Austria under the guardianship of his\r\nuncle Frederick, duke of Styria, afterwards the emperor Frederick III.,\r\nand Bohemia, still without regular government, continued to be the scene\r\nof constant conflicts between the rival parties of the nobility. In 1446\r\na general meeting of the estates of Bohemia together with those of\r\nMoravia, Silesia and Lusatia--and so-called \"lands of the Bohemian\r\ncrown\"--took place. This meeting has exceptional importance for the\r\nconstitutional history of Bohemia. It was decreed that at the meeting of\r\nthe estates their members should be divided into three bodies--known as\r\n_curiae_--representing the nobles, the knights and the towns. These\r\n_curiae_ were to deliberate separately and only to meet for a final\r\ndecision. An attempt made at this meeting to appoint a regent was\r\nunsuccessful. The negotiations with the papal see continued meanwhile,\r\nbut led to no result, as the members of the Roman party used their\r\ninfluence at the papal court for the purpose of dissuading it from\r\ngranting any concessions to their countrymen. Shortly after the\r\ntermination of the diet of 1446 George of Podebrad therefore determined\r\nto appeal to the fortune of war. He assembled a considerable army at\r\nKutna Hora and marched on Prague (1448). He occupied the town almost\r\nwithout resistance and assumed the regency over the kingdom. The diet in\r\n1451 recognized his title, which was also sanctioned by the emperor\r\nFrederick III., guardian of the young king. Podebrad was none the less\r\nopposed, almost from the first, by the Romanists, who even concluded an\r\nalliance against him with their extreme opponents, Kolda of Zampach and\r\nthe other remaining Taborites. In October 1453 Ladislas arrived in\r\nBohemia and was crowned king at Prague; but he died somewhat suddenly on\r\nthe 23rd of November 1457. George of Podebrad has from the first\r\nfrequently been accused of having poisoned him, but historical research\r\nhas proved that this accusation is entirely unfounded. The Bohemian\r\nthrone was now again vacant, for, when electing Ladislas the estates had\r\nreaffirmed the elective character of the monarchy. Though there were\r\nseveral foreign candidates, the estates unanimously elected George of\r\nPodebrad, who had now for some time administered the country. Though the\r\nRomanist lords, whom Podebrad had for a time won over, also voted for\r\nhim, the election was considered a great victory of the national party\r\nand was welcomed with enthusiasm by the citizens of Prague.\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier and more prosperous part of his reign the policy of\r\nKing George was founded on a firm alliance with Matthias Corvinus, king\r\nof Hungary, through whose influence he was crowned by the Romanist\r\nbishop of Waitzen. The reign of King George, whose principal supporters\r\nwere the men of the smaller nobility and of the towns, was at first very\r\nprosperous. After a certain time, however, some of the Romanist nobles\r\nbecame hostile to the king, and, partly through their influence, he\r\nbecame involved in a protracted struggle with the papal see. It was in\r\nconsequence of this struggle that some of George's far-reaching\r\nplans--he endeavoured for a time to obtain the supremacy over\r\nGermany--failed. After the negotiations with Rome had proved\r\nunsuccessful George assembled the estates at Prague in 1452 and declared\r\nthat he would to his death remain true to the communion in both kinds,\r\nand that he was ready to risk his life and his crown in the defence of\r\nhis faith. The Romanist party in Bohemia became yet more embittered\r\nagainst the king, and at a meeting at Zelena Hora (Grunberg) in 1465\r\nmany nobles of the Roman religion joined in a confederacy against him.\r\nIn the following year Pope Paul II. granted his moral support to the\r\nconfederates by pronouncing sentence of excommunication against George\r\nof Podebrad and by releasing all Bohemians from their oath of allegiance\r\nto him. It was also through papal influence that King Matthias of\r\nHungary, deserting his former ally, supported the lords of the league of\r\nZelena Hora. Desultory warfare broke out between the two parties, in\r\nwhich George was at first successful; but fortune changed when the king\r\nof Hungary invaded Moravia and obtained possession of Brunn, the capital\r\nof the country. At a meeting of the Catholic nobles of Bohemia and\r\nMoravia at Olmutz in Moravia, Matthias was proclaimed king of Bohemia\r\n(May 3, 1469). In the following year George obtained some successes over\r\nhis rival, but his death in 1471 for a time put a stop to the war.\r\nGeorge of Podebrad, the only Hussite king of Bohemia, has always, with\r\nCharles IV., been the ruler of Bohemia whose memory has most endeared\r\nitself to his countrymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Vladislav of Poland.\r\n\r\nGeorge of Podebrad had undoubtedly during the more prosperous part of\r\nhis reign intended to found a national dynasty. In later years, however,\r\nhope of obtaining aid from Poland in his struggle against King Matthias\r\ninduced him to offer the succession to the Bohemian throne to Vladislav\r\n(Wladislaus, Ladislaus), son of Casimir, king of Poland. No formal\r\nagreement was made, and at the death of George many Bohemian nobles\r\nsupported the claim of Matthias of Hungary, who had already been\r\nproclaimed king of Bohemia. Protracted negotiations ensued, but they\r\nended by the election of Prince Vladislav of Poland at Kutna Hora, the\r\n27th of May 1471. This election was a victory of the national party, and\r\nmay be considered as evidence of the strong anti-clerical feeling which\r\nthen prevailed in Bohemia; for Matthias was an unconditional adherent of\r\nRome, while the Polish envoys who represented Vladislav promised that he\r\nwould maintain the Compacts. At the beginning of his reign the new king\r\nwas involved in a struggle with Matthias of Hungary, who maintained his\r\nclaim to the Bohemian throne. Prolonged desultory warfare continued up\r\nto 1478, when a treaty concluded at Olmutz secured Bohemia to Vladislav;\r\nMatthias was to retain the so-called \"lands of the Bohemian\r\ncrown\"--Moravia, Silesia and Lusatia--during his lifetime, and they were\r\nto be restored to Bohemia after his death. Though Vladislav was faithful\r\nto his promise of maintaining the Compacts, and did not attempt to\r\nprevent the Bohemians from receiving the communion in both kinds, yet\r\nhis policy was on the whole a reactionary one, both as regards matters\r\nof state and the religious controversies. The king appointed as\r\ngovernment officials at Prague men of that section of the Utraquist\r\nparty that was nearest to Rome, while a severe persecution of the\r\nextreme Hussites known as the Bohemian Brethren took place (see\r\nHUSSITES). Serious riots took place at Prague, and the more advanced\r\nHussites stormed the three town halls of the city. The nobles of the\r\nsame faith also formed a league to guard themselves against the menaced\r\nreaction. A meeting of all the estates at Kutna Hora in 1485, however,\r\nfor a time restored peace. Both parties agreed to respect the religious\r\nviews of their opponents and to abstain from all violence, and the\r\nCompacts were again confirmed.\r\n\r\nAs regards matters of state the reign of Vladislav is marked by a\r\ndecrease of the royal prerogative, while the power of the nobility\r\nattained an unprecedented height, at the expense, not only of the royal\r\npower, but also of the rights of the townsmen and peasants. A decree of\r\n1487 practically established serfdom in Bohemia, where it had hitherto\r\nbeen almost unknown. It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of\r\nthis measure for the future of Bohemia. The rulers of the country were\r\nhenceforth unable to rely on that numerous sturdy and independent\r\npeasantry of which the armies of Zizka and the Prokops had mainly\r\nconsisted. Various enactments belonging to this reign also curtailed the\r\nrights of the Bohemian townsmen. A decree known as the \"regulations of\r\nKing Vladislav\" codified these changes. It enumerated all the rights of\r\nthe nobles and knights, but entirely ignored those of the towns. It was\r\ntacitly assumed that the townsmen had no inherent rights, but only such\r\nprivileges as might be granted them by their sovereign with the consent\r\nof the nobles and knights. Civil discord was the inevitable consequence\r\nof these enactments. Several meeting? of the diet took place at which\r\nthe towns were not represented. The latter in 1513 formed a confederacy\r\nto defend their rights, and chose Prince Bartholomew of Munsterberg--a\r\ngrandson of King George--as their leader.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Louis.\r\n\r\nVladislav was elected king of Hungary in 1490 and many of the events of\r\nhis later life belong to the history of Hungary. He married in 1502 Anna\r\nde Candale, who was connected with the royal family of France. He had\r\ntwo children by her, Anna, who afterwards married the archduke Ferdinand\r\nof Austria, and Louis. Vladislav died in Hungary in 1516. His successor\r\nwas his son Louis, who had already been crowned as king of Bohemia at\r\nthe age of three. According to the instructions of Vladislav, Sigismund,\r\nking of Poland, and the emperor Maximilian I. were to act as guardians\r\nof the young king. The Bohemian estates recognized this decision, but\r\nthey refused to allow the guardians any right of interference in the\r\naffairs of Bohemia. The great Bohemian nobles, and in particular the\r\nsupreme burgrave, Zdenek Leo, lord of Rozmital, ruled the country almost\r\nwithout control. The beginning of the nominal reign of King Louis is\r\nmarked by an event which had great importance for the constitutional\r\ndevelopment of Bohemia. At a meeting of the estates in 1517 known as the\r\ndiet of St Wenceslas--as the members first assembled on the 28th of\r\nSeptember, the anniversary of that saint--they came to terms and settled\r\nthe questions which had been the causes of discord. The citizens\r\nrenounced certain privileges which they had hitherto claimed, while the\r\ntwo other estates recognized their municipal autonomy and tacitly\r\nsanctioned their presence at the meetings of the diet, to which they had\r\nalready been informally readmitted since 1508. At the first sitting of\r\nthis diet, on the 24th of October, it was declared that the three\r\nestates had agreed henceforth \"to live together in friendly intercourse,\r\nas became men belonging to the same country and race.\" In 1522 Louis\r\narrived in Bohemia from Hungary, of which country he had also been\r\nelected king. On his arrival at Prague he dismissed all the Bohemian\r\nstate officials, including the powerful Leo of Rozmital. He appointed\r\nCharles of Munsterberg, a cousin of Prince Bartholomew and also a\r\ngrandson of King George, as regent of Bohemia during his absences, and\r\nJohn of Wartenberg as burgrave. The new officials appear to have\r\nsupported the more advanced Hussite party, while Rozmital and the\r\nmembers of the town council of Prague who had acted in concert with him\r\nhad been the allies of the Romanists and those Utraquists who were\r\nnearest to the Church of Rome. The new officials thus incurred the\r\ndispleasure of King Louis, who was at that moment seeking the aid of the\r\npope in his warfare with Turkey. The king therefore reinstated Leo of\r\nRozmital in his offices in 1525. Shortly afterwards Rozmital became\r\ninvolved in a feud with the lords of Rosenberg; the feud became a civil\r\nwar, in which most of the nobles and cities of Bohemia took sides.\r\nMeanwhile Louis, who had returned to Hungary, opened his campaign\r\nagainst the Turks. He requested aid from his Bohemian subjects, and this\r\nwas granted, by the Rosenberg faction, while Rozmital and his party\r\npurposely delayed sending any forces to Hungary. There were, therefore,\r\nbut few Bohemian troops at the battle of Mohacs (August 29, 1526) at\r\nwhich Louis was decisively defeated and perished.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Origin of the Habsburg dynasty.\r\n\r\n  Ferdinand.\r\n\r\nThe death of Louis found Bohemia in a state of great disorder, almost of\r\nanarchy. The two last kings had mainly resided in Hungary, and in spite\r\nof the temporary agreement obtained at the diet of St Wenceslas, the\r\nBohemians had not succeeded in establishing a strong indigenous\r\ngovernment which might have taken the place of the absentee monarchs.\r\nArchduke Ferdinand of Austria--afterwards the emperor Ferdinand I.--laid\r\nclaim to the Bohemian throne as husband of Anna, daughter of King\r\nVladislav. King Sigismund of Poland, the dukes Louis and William of\r\nBavaria, several other German princes, as well as several Bohemian\r\nnoblemen, of whom Leo of Rozmital was the most important, were also\r\ncandidates. The diet resolved to entrust the election to twenty-four of\r\ntheir members, chosen in equal number from the three estates. These\r\nelectors, on the 23rd of October (1526), chose Ferdinand of Habsburg as\r\ntheir king. This date is memorable, as it marks the permanent accession\r\nof the Habsburg dynasty to the Bohemian throne, though the Austrian\r\narchdukes Rudolph and Albert had previously been rulers of Bohemia for\r\nshort periods. Though Ferdinand fully shared that devotion to Rome which\r\nis traditional in the Habsburg dynasty, he showed great moderation in\r\nreligious matters, particularly at the beginning of his reign. His\r\nprincipal object was to establish the hereditary right of his dynasty to\r\nthe Bohemian throne, and this object he pursued with characteristic\r\nobstinacy. When a great fire broke out at Prague in 1541, which\r\ndestroyed all the state documents, Ferdinand obtained the consent of the\r\nestates to the substitution of a charter stating that he had been\r\nrecognized as king in consequence of the hereditary rights of his wife\r\nAnna, in the place of the former one, which had stated that he had\r\nbecome king by election. This caused great dissatisfaction and was one\r\nof the principal causes of the troubles that broke out shortly\r\nafterwards. Ferdinand had in 1531, mainly through the influence of his\r\nbrother the emperor Charles V., been elected king of the Romans and heir\r\nto the Empire. He henceforth took a large part in the politics of\r\nGermany, particularly after he had in 1547 concluded a treaty of peace\r\nwith Turkey, which assured the safety of the eastern frontiers of his\r\ndominions. Charles V. about the same time concluded his war with France,\r\nand the brothers determined to adopt a firmer policy towards the\r\nProtestants of Germany, whose power had recently greatly increased. The\r\nlatter had, about the time of the recognition of Ferdinand as king of\r\nthe Romans, and partly in consequence of that event, formed at\r\nSchmalkalden a league, of which John Frederick, elector of Saxony, and\r\nPhilip, landgrave of Hesse, were the leaders. War broke out in Germany\r\nin the summer of 1546, and Charles relied on the aid of his brother,\r\nwhile the German Protestants on the other hand appealed to their\r\nBohemian co-religionists for aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Struggles in the war against German Protestantism.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of the Reformation in Germany the views of the\r\nBohemian reformers had undergone a considerable change. Some of the more\r\nadvanced Utraquists differed but little from the German Lutherans, while\r\nthe Bohemian Brethren, who at this moment greatly increased in influence\r\nthrough the accession of several powerful nobles, strongly sympathized\r\nwith the Protestants of Germany. Ferdinand's task of raising a Bohemian\r\narmy in support of his brother was therefore a difficult one. He again\r\nemployed his usual tortuous policy. He persuaded the estates to vote a\r\ngeneral levy of the forces of the country under the somewhat\r\ndisingenuous pretext that Bohemia was menaced by the Turks; for at that\r\nperiod no armed force could be raised in Bohemia without the consent of\r\nthe estates of the realm. Ferdinand fixed the town of Kaaden on the\r\nSaxon frontier as the spot where the troops were to meet, but on his\r\narrival there he found that many cities and nobles--particularly those\r\nwho belonged to the community of the Bohemian Brethren--had sent no men.\r\nOf the soldiers who arrived many were Protestants who sympathized with\r\ntheir German co-religionists. The Bohemian army refused to cross the\r\nSaxon frontier, and towards the end of the year 1546 Ferdinand was\r\nobliged to disband his Bohemian forces. Early in the following year he\r\nagain called on his Bohemian subjects to furnish an army in aid of his\r\nbrother. Only a few of the Romanists and more retrograde Utraquists\r\nobeyed his order. The large majority of Bohemians, on the other hand,\r\nconsidered the moment opportune for recovering the ancient liberties of\r\nBohemia, on which Ferdinand had encroached in various ways by claiming\r\nhereditary right to the crown and by curtailing the old privileges of\r\nthe land. The estates met at Prague in March 1547, without awaiting a\r\nroyal summons,--undoubtedly an unconstitutional proceeding. The\r\nassembly, in which the influence of the representatives of the town of\r\nPrague and of the knights and nobles who belonged to the Bohemian\r\nBrotherhood was predominant, had a very revolutionary character. This\r\nbecame yet more marked when the news of the elector of Saxony's victory\r\nat Rochlitz reached Prague. The estates demanded the re-establishment of\r\nthe elective character of the Bohemian kingdom, the recognition of\r\nreligious liberty for all, and various enactments limiting the royal\r\nprerogative. It was decided to entrust the management of state affairs\r\nto a committee of twelve members chosen in equal number from the three\r\nestates. Of the members of the committee chosen by the knights and\r\nnobles four belonged to the Bohemian Brotherhood. The committee decided\r\nto equip an armed force, the command of which was conferred on Kaspar\r\nPflug of Rabenstein (d. 1576). According to his instructions he was\r\nmerely to march to the Saxon frontier, and there await further orders\r\nfrom the estates; there seems, however, little doubt that he was\r\nsecretly instructed to afford aid to the German Protestants. Pflug\r\nmarched to Joachimsthal on the frontier, but refused to enter Saxon\r\nterritory without a special command of the estates.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the great victory of the imperialists at Muhlberg had for a\r\ntime crushed German Protestantism. The Bohemians were in a very\r\ndifficult position. They had seriously offended their sovereign and yet\r\nafforded no aid to the German Protestants. The army of Pflug hastily\r\ndispersed, and the estates still assembled at Prague endeavoured to\r\npropitiate Ferdinand. They sent envoys to the camp of the king who, with\r\nhis brother Charles, was then besieging Wittenberg. Ferdinand received\r\nthe envoys better than they had perhaps expected. He indeed always\r\nmaintained his plan of making Bohemia a hereditary kingdom under\r\nHabsburg rule, and of curtailing as far as possible its ancient\r\nconstitution, but he did not wish to drive to despair a still warlike\r\npeople. Ferdinand demanded that the Bohemians should renounce all\r\nalliances with the German Protestants, and declared that he would make\r\nhis will known after his arrival in Prague. He arrived there on the 20th\r\nof July, with a large force of Spanish and Walloon mercenaries, and\r\noccupied the city almost without resistance. Ferdinand treated the\r\nnobles and knights with great forbearance, and contented himself with\r\nthe confiscation of the estates of some of those who had been most\r\ncompromised. On the other hand he dealt very severely with the\r\ntowns--Prague in particular. He declared that their ancient privileges\r\nshould be revised--a measure that practically signified a broad\r\nconfiscation of lands that belonged to the municipalities. Ferdinand\r\nalso forced the townsmen to accept the control of state officials who\r\nwere to be called town-judges and in Prague town-captains. These royal\r\nrepresentatives were given almost unlimited control over municipal\r\naffairs. The Bohemian Brethren were also severely persecuted, and their\r\nbishop Augusta was imprisoned for many years.\r\n\r\nFerdinand's policy here was as able as it always was. The peasantry had\r\nceased to be dangerous since the establishment of serfdom; the power of\r\nthe cities was now thoroughly undermined. Ferdinand had only to deal\r\nwith the nobles and knights, and he hoped that the influence of his\r\ncourt, and yet more that of the Jesuits, whom he established in Bohemia\r\nabout this time, would gradually render them amenable to the royal will.\r\nIf we consider the customs of his time Ferdinand cannot be considered as\r\nhaving acted with cruelty in the moment of his success. Only four of the\r\nprincipal leaders of the revolt--two knights, and two citizens of\r\nPrague--were sentenced to death. They were decapitated on the square\r\noutside the Hradcany palace where the estates met on that day (August\r\n22). This diet therefore became known as the \"Krvavy'sneem\" (bloody\r\ndiet). In one of the last years of his life (1562) Ferdinand succeeded\r\nin obtaining the coronation of his eldest son Maximilian as king of\r\nBohemia, thus ensuring to him the succession to the Bohemian throne. As\r\nFerdinand I. acceded to the Hungarian throne at the same time as to\r\nthat of Bohemia, and as he also became king of the Romans and after the\r\ndeath of Charles V. emperor, many events of his life do not belong to\r\nthe history of Bohemia. He died in 1564.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Maximilian.\r\n\r\n  Abolition of the \"Compacts.\"\r\n\r\nMaximilian succeeded his father as king of Bohemia without any\r\nopposition. Circumstances were greatly in his favour; he had in his\r\nyouth mainly been educated by Protestant tutors, and for a time openly\r\navowed strong sympathy for the party of church reform. This fact, which\r\nbecame known in Bohemia, secured for him the support of the Bohemian\r\nchurch reformers, while the Romanists and retrograde Utraquists were\r\ntraditionally on the side of the house of Habsburg. The reign of\r\nMaximilian did not fulfil the hopes that met it. Though he published new\r\ndecrees against the Bohemian Brethren, he generally refused to sanction\r\nany measures against the Protestants, in spite of the advice of the\r\nJesuits, who were gradually obtaining great influence in Bohemia. He did\r\nnothing, however, to satisfy the expectations of the partisans of church\r\nreform, and indeed after a time began again to assist at the functions\r\nof the Roman church, from which he had long absented himself.\r\nIndifference, perhaps founded on religious scepticism, characterized the\r\nking during the many ecclesiastical disputes that played so large a part\r\nin his reign. In 1567 Maximilian, who had also succeeded his father as\r\nking of Hungary and emperor, visited the Bohemians for the first time\r\nsince his accession to the throne. Like most princes of the Habsburg\r\ndynasty, he was constantly confronted at this period by the difficulty\r\nof raising funds for warfare against the Turks. When he asked the\r\nBohemians to grant him supplies for this purpose, they immediately\r\nretorted by bringing forward their demands with regard to matters of\r\nreligion. Their principal demand appears somewhat strange in the light\r\nof the events of the past. The estates expressed the wish that the\r\ncelebrated Compacts should cease to form part of the laws of the\r\ncountry. These enactments had indeed granted freedom of worship to the\r\nmost moderate Utraquists--men who, except that they claimed the right to\r\nreceive the communion in both kinds, hardly differed in their faith from\r\nthe Roman church. On the other hand Ferdinand I. had used the Compacts\r\nas an instrument which justified him in oppressing the Bohemian\r\nBrethren, and the advanced Utraquists, whose teaching now differed but\r\nlittle from that of Luther. He had argued that all those who professed\r\ndoctrines differing from the Church of Rome more widely than did the\r\nretrograde Utraquists, were outside the pale of religious toleration.\r\nMaximilian, indifferent as usual to matters of religious controversy,\r\nconsented to the abolition of the Compacts, and these enactments, which\r\nhad once been sacred to the Bohemian people, perished unregretted by all\r\nparties. The Romanists had always hated them, believing them not to be\r\nin accord with the general custom of the papal church, while the\r\nLutherans and Bohemian Brethren considered their suppression a guarantee\r\nof their own liberty of worship.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Confessio Bohemica.\r\n\r\nIn 1575 Maximilian, who had long been absent from Bohemia, returned\r\nthere, as the estates refused to grant subsidies to an absentee monarch.\r\nThe sittings of the diet that met in 1575 were very prolonged. The king\r\nmaintained a vacillating attitude, influenced now by the threats of the\r\nBohemians, now by the advice of the papal nuncio, who had followed him\r\nto Prague. The latter strongly represented to him how great would be the\r\ndifficulties that he would encounter in his other dominions, should he\r\nmake concessions to the Protestants of Bohemia. The principal demand of\r\nthe Bohemians was that the \"Confession of Augsburg\"--a summary of\r\nLuther's teaching--should be recognized in Bohemia. They further renewed\r\nthe demand, which they had already expressed at the diet of 1567, that\r\nthe estates should have the right of appointing the members of the\r\nconsistory--the ecclesiastical body which ruled the Utraquist church;\r\nfor since the death of John of Rokycan that church had had no\r\narchbishop. After long deliberations and the king's final refusal to\r\nrecognize the confession of Augsburg, the majority of the diet,\r\nconsisting of members of the Bohemian brotherhood and advanced\r\nUtraquists, drew up a profession of faith that became known as the\r\n_Confessio Bohemica_. It was in most points identical with the Augsburg\r\nconfession, but differed from it with regard to the doctrine of the\r\nsacrament of the Lord's Supper. Here the Bohemian profession agreed with\r\nthe views of Calvin rather than with those of Luther. This is\r\nundoubtedly due to the influence of the Bohemian Brethren. The\r\n_Confessio Bohemica_ was presented to Maximilian, who verbally expressed\r\nhis approval, but would not consent to this being made public, and also\r\nrefused his consent to the inclusion of the _Confessio_ among the\r\ncharters of the kingdom. Maximilian rejected the demand of the Bohemian\r\nestates, that they and not the king should in future appoint the members\r\nof the consistory. He finally, however, consented to exempt the\r\nLutherans and advanced Utraquists from the jurisdiction of the\r\nconsistory, and allowed them to choose fifteen defenders--five of whom\r\nwere to belong to each of the estates--who were to have supreme control\r\nover the Lutheran church. These defenders were to appoint for each\r\ndistrict a superintendent (moderator), who was to maintain order and\r\ndiscipline among the clergy. As the Bohemian Brotherhood had never\r\nrecognized the consistory, that body now lost whatever influence it had\r\nstill possessed. It became, indeed, subservient to the Romanist\r\narchbishopric of Prague, which had been re-established by Ferdinand I.\r\nIts members henceforth were men who on almost all points agreed with\r\nRome, and sometimes even men who had joined the Roman church, but\r\ncontinued by order of their superiors to remain members of the\r\nconsistory, where it was thought that their influence might be useful to\r\ntheir new creed.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rudolph.\r\n\r\nThe results of the diet of 1575 were on the whole favourable to the\r\nestates, and they seem to have taken this view, for almost immediately\r\nafterwards they recognized Maximilian's eldest son Rudolph as his\r\nsuccessor and consented to his being crowned king of Bohemia. Maximilian\r\ndied in the following year, and Rudolph succeeded him without any\r\nopposition. The events of the last years of the reign of Rudolph have\r\nthe greatest importance for Bohemian history, but the earlier part of\r\nhis reign requires little notice. As Rudolph had been educated in Spain\r\nit was at first thought that he would treat the Bohemian church\r\nreformers with great severity. The new sovereign, however, showed with\r\nregard to the unceasing religious controversy the same apathy and\r\nindifference with which he also met matters of state. He had been from\r\nhis early youth subject to fits of melancholia, and during several short\r\nperiods was actually insane. Rudolph was a great patron of the arts, and\r\nhe greatly contributed to the embellishment of Prague, which, as it was\r\nhis favourite residence, became the centre of the vast Habsburg\r\ndominions. In 1600 the mental condition of Rudolph became so seriously\r\nimpaired that the princes of the house of Habsburg thought it necessary\r\nto consider the future of the state, particularly as Rudolph had no\r\nlegitimate descendants. Matthias, the eldest of his brothers, came to\r\nPrague and pointed out to Rudolph the necessity of appointing a\r\ncoadjutor, should he be incapacitated from fulfilling his royal duties,\r\nand also of making arrangements concerning the succession to the throne.\r\nThese suggestions were indignantly repelled by Rudolph, whose anger was\r\ngreatly increased by a letter of Pope Clement VIII. The pope in a\r\nforcible though formally courteous manner pointed out to him the evil\r\nresults which his neglect of his royal duties would entail on his\r\nsubjects, and called on him to appoint one of the Habsburg princes his\r\nsuccessor both to the imperial crown and to the thrones of Bohemia and\r\nHungary. It is probable that the fear that the pope might make good the\r\nthreats contained in this letter induced Rudolph, who had hitherto been\r\nindifferent to matters of religion, to become more subservient to the\r\nRoman church. The papal nuncio at Prague, in particular, appears for a\r\ntime to have obtained great influence over the king. Under this\r\ninfluence, Rudolph in 1602 issued a decree which renewed obsolete\r\nenactments against the Bohemian Brethren that had been published by King\r\nVladislav in 1508. The royal decree was purposely worded in an obscure\r\nmanner. It referred to the Compacts that had been abolished, and was\r\nliable to an interpretation excluding from tolerance all but the\r\nRomanists and the retrograde Utraquists. It appeared therefore as a\r\nmenace to the Lutherans--and all the more advanced Utraquists had now\r\nembraced that creed--as well as to the Bohemian Brethren. The estates of\r\nBohemia met at Prague in January 1603. The discussions were very stormy.\r\nBudovec of Budova, a nobleman belonging to the community of the Bohemian\r\nBrethren, became the leader of all those who were opposed to the Church\r\nof Rome. He vigorously attacked the royal decree, which he declared to\r\nbe contrary to the promises made by King Maximilian. He, however,\r\nadvised the estates to vote the supplies that King Rudolph had demanded.\r\nImmediately after this vote had been passed, the diet was closed by\r\norder of the king. Though the royal power was at that period very weak\r\nin Bohemia, the open partisanship of the king encouraged the Romanist\r\nnobles, who were not numerous, but among whom were some owners of large\r\nestates, to attempt to re-establish the Roman creed on their\r\nterritories. Some of these nobles committed great cruelties while\r\nattempting to obtain these forcible conversions.\r\n\r\nStrife again broke out between Rudolph and his treacherous younger\r\nbrother Matthias, who used the religious and political controversies of\r\nthe time for the purpose of supplanting his brother. The formal cause of\r\nthe rupture between the two princes was Rudolph's refusal to sanction a\r\ntreaty of peace with Turkey, which Matthias had concluded as his\r\nbrother's representative in Hungary. The Hungarians accepted Matthias as\r\ntheir ruler, and when his forces entered Moravia the estates of that\r\ncountry had, by Charles, lord of Zerotin, also renounced the allegiance\r\nof Rudolph. Matthias then invaded Bohemia, and invited the estates of\r\nthe kingdom to meet him at Caslav (Ceslau). In consequence of a sudden\r\nrevolution of feeling for which it is difficult to account, the\r\nBohemians declined the overtures of Matthias. The estates met at Prague\r\nin March 1608, and, though again submitting their demands concerning\r\necclesiastical matters to Rudolph, authorized him to levy troops for the\r\ndefence of Bohemia. The forces of Matthias had meanwhile entered Bohemia\r\nand had arrived at Liben, a small town near Prague now incorporated with\r\nthat city. Here Matthias, probably disappointed by the refusal of the\r\nBohemians to join his standard, came to an understanding with his\r\nbrother (June 25, 1608). Rudolph formally ceded to Matthias the\r\ngovernment of Hungary, Moravia, and Upper and Lower Austria, but\r\nretained his rights as king of Bohemia.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Diet of 1609. Demand for religious liberty.\r\n\r\nSoon after the conclusion of this temporary settlement, the estates of\r\nBohemia again brought their demands before their king. Rudolph had\r\ndeclined to discuss all religious matters during the time that the\r\ntroops of his brother occupied part of Bohemia. The diet that met on the\r\n20th of January 1609 is one of the most important in the history of\r\nBohemia. Here, as so frequently in the 17th century, the religious\r\ncontroversies were largely influenced by personal enmities. Rudolph\r\nnever forgave the treachery of his brother, and was secretly negotiating\r\n(at the time when he again appeared as champion of Catholicism) with\r\nChristian of Anhalt, the leader of the German Protestants. This was\r\nknown to the court of Spain, and the Bohemians also knew that the king\r\ncould therefore rely on no aid from that quarter. They were therefore\r\nnot intimidated when Rudolph, vacillating as ever, suddenly assumed a\r\nmost truculent attitude. The estates had at their meeting in March of\r\nthe previous year drawn up a document consisting of twenty-five\r\nso-called Articles, which formulated their demands with regard to\r\nmatters of religion. The king now demanded that this document, which he\r\nconsidered illegal, should be delivered up to him for destruction. The\r\n\"articles\" expressed the wish that the _Confessio Bohemica_ should be\r\nrecognized as one of the fundamental laws of the kingdom, and that\r\ncomplete religious liberty should be granted to all classes. They\r\nfurther demanded that the Protestants--as it now became customary to\r\ncall jointly the Utraquists, Lutherans and Bohemian Brethren--and the\r\nRoman Catholics should have an equal right to hold all the offices of\r\nstate, and that the power of the Jesuits to acquire land should be\r\nlimited. They finally asked for redress of several grievances caused by\r\nthe misrule of Rudolph. This document had remained in the hands of\r\nBudova, who refused to deliver it to the king. The estates then chose\r\ntwelve of their number--among whom was Count Henry Matthias Thurn--who\r\nwere to negotiate with the king and his councillors. Protracted\r\ndiscussions ensued, and the king finally stated, on the 31st of March,\r\nthat he could grant no concessions in matters of religion. On the\r\nfollowing day the estates met under the leadership of Budova. They\r\ndecided to arm for the defence of their rights, and when the king\r\nimmediately afterwards dissolved the diet, it was resolved to meet again\r\nafter a month, even without a royal summons. When they returned to\r\nPrague, Adam of Sternberg, the burgrave, again informed Budova that the\r\nking would grant no concessions in ecclesiastical matters. Bohemia\r\nappeared to be on the verge of a revolution. It is unnecessary to record\r\nthe frequent and contradictory resolutions of the king, influenced now\r\nby the extreme Romanists, now by those of his councillors who favoured a\r\npeaceful solution. Finally--on the 9th of July 1609--Rudolph signed the\r\nfamed \"Letter of Majesty\" which gave satisfaction to all the legitimate\r\ndemands of the Bohemian Protestants. In the \"Letter of Majesty\" Rudolph\r\nrecognized the _Confessio Bohemica_. He further granted to the\r\nProtestant estates the control over the university of Prague, and\r\nauthorized them to elect the members of the Utraquist consistory. They\r\nwere further empowered to elect \"defenders\" chosen in equal number from\r\nthe estates of the nobles, knights and citizens, who were to superintend\r\nthe execution of the enactments of the Letter of Majesty and generally\r\nto uphold the rights of the Protestants. On the same day the Romanist\r\nand the Protestant members of the diet also signed an agreement by which\r\nthey guaranteed to each other full liberty of religious worship and\r\ndeclared that this liberty should be extended to all classes of the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Matthias.\r\n\r\nIn 1611 the peace of Bohemia was again disturbed by the invasion of the\r\narchduke Leopold of Austria, bishop of Passau, who probably acted in\r\nconnivance with his cousin King Rudolph. Leopold succeeded in obtaining\r\npossession of part of the town of Prague, but his army was defeated by\r\nthe troops which the Bohemian estates had hurriedly raised, and he was\r\nobliged to leave Bohemia. Matthias considered his hereditary rights\r\nmenaced by the raid of Leopold and again occupied Bohemia. Mainly at his\r\ninstigation the estates now formally deposed Rudolph, who survived his\r\ndethronement only a few months, and died on the 20th of January 1612.\r\nThough Matthias had allied himself with the Bohemian Protestants during\r\nhis prolonged struggle against his brother, he now adopted that policy\r\nfavourable to the Church of Rome which is traditional of the Habsburg\r\ndynasty. His relations with the Bohemian Protestants, therefore, soon\r\nbecame strained. In 1615 Matthias convoked a general diet, i.e. one that\r\nbesides the Bohemian representatives included also the representatives\r\nof the \"lands of the Bohemian crown.\" At the meeting of this diet the\r\nquestion of nationality, which through the constant religious\r\ncontroversies had receded to the background, again became predominant.\r\nFormer enactments enforcing the use of the national language were\r\nreaffirmed, and it was decreed that Bohemian should be the \"authorized\"\r\n(i.e. official) language of the country.\r\n\r\nAs Matthias was childless, the question as to the succession to the\r\nBohemian throne again arose. The king wished to secure the succession to\r\nhis cousin Ferdinand, duke of Styria. Ferdinand was known as a fanatical\r\nadherent of the Church of Rome and as a cruel persecutor of the\r\nProtestants of Styria. None the less the state officials of Bohemia, by\r\nnot very scrupulous means, succeeded in persuading the estates to accept\r\nFerdinand as heir to the throne and to consent to his coronation, which\r\ntook place at Prague on the 17th of June 1617. No doubt through the\r\ninfluence of Ferdinand, the policy of Matthias henceforth assumed a yet\r\nmore pronouncedly ultramontane character. The king's councillors, all\r\nadherents of the Church of Rome, openly expressed their hope that the\r\nCatholic Church would soon recover its ancient hold over Bohemia. On the\r\nother hand the Bohemian Protestants, led by Count Thurn, one of the few\r\nnobles who had refused to vote for the recognition of Ferdinand as heir\r\nto the throne, did not wish to defer what they considered an inevitable\r\nconflict. It appeared to them more advantageous to encounter the weak\r\nMatthias than his younger and more fanatical successor. A comparatively\r\nunimportant incident precipitated matters. In December 1617, the\r\narchbishop of Prague and the abbot of Brevnov (Braunau) ordered the\r\nsuppression of the Protestant religious services in churches that had\r\nbeen built on their domains. This was a direct infringement of the\r\nagreement concluded by the Romanist and Utraquist estates on the day on\r\nwhich King Rudolph had signed the Letter of Majesty. The defenders took\r\nimmediate action, by inviting all Protestant members of the diet to meet\r\nat Prague. They assembled there on 21st of May 1618, and decided to\r\nproceed in full armour to the Hradcany palace to bring their complaints\r\nto the knowledge of the councillors of Matthias. On the following day,\r\nThurn, Wenceslas of Ruppa, Ulrich of Kinsky, and other members of the\r\nmore advanced party held a secret meeting, at which it was decided to\r\nput to death the most influential of Matthias's councillors. On the 23rd\r\nthe representatives of the Protestants of Bohemia proceeded to the\r\nHradcany. Violent accusations were brought forward, particularly against\r\nMartinic and Slavata, the king's most trusted councillors, who were\r\naccused of having advised him to oppose the wishes of the Bohemians.\r\nFinally these two councillors, together with Fabricius, secretary of the\r\nroyal council, were thrown from the windows of the Hradcany into the\r\nmoat below--an event known in history as the Defenestration of Prague.\r\nBoth Martinic and Slavata were but little injured, and succeeded in\r\nescaping from Prague. The Bohemians immediately established a\r\nprovisional government consisting of thirty \"directors,\" ten of whom\r\nwere chosen by each of the estates. They also proceeded to raise an\r\narmed force, the command of which was given to Count Thurn. Hostilities\r\nwith Austria began in July, when an imperial force entered Bohemia. The\r\ntroops of Matthias were, however, soon repulsed by the Bohemians, and in\r\nNovember Thurn's army entered Austria, but was soon obliged to retire to\r\nBohemia because of the lateness of the season.\r\n\r\n\r\n  War with the emperor Ferdinand.\r\n\r\nIn the following March the Bohemian crown became vacant by the death of\r\nMatthias. On the 31st of July the Bohemian estates pronounced the formal\r\ndeposition of Ferdinand, and on the 26th of August they elected as their\r\nking Frederick, elector palatine. The new king and his queen, Elizabeth\r\nof England, arrived in Bohemia in October, and were crowned somewhat\r\nlater at St Vitus's cathedral in Prague. Warfare with Austria continued\r\nduring this year--1619. Thurn occupied Moravia, which now threw in its\r\nlot with Bohemia, and he even advanced on Vienna, but was soon obliged\r\nto retreat. In the following year events took a fatal turn for Bohemia.\r\nThe powerful duke Maximilian of Bavaria joined his forces to those of\r\nFerdinand, who had become Matthias's successor as emperor, and who was\r\ndetermined to reconquer Bohemia. Ferdinand also received aid from Spain,\r\nPoland and several Italian states. Even the Lutheran elector of Saxony\r\nespoused his cause. A large imperialist army, under the command of the\r\nduke of Bavaria, Tilly and Bouquoi, entered Bohemia in September 1620.\r\nAfter several skirmishes, in all of which the Bohemians were defeated,\r\nthe imperial forces arrived at the outskirts of Prague on the evening of\r\nthe 7th of November. On the following morning they attacked the Bohemian\r\narmy, which occupied a slightly fortified position on the plateau known\r\nas the \"Bila Hora\" (White Hill). The Bohemians were defeated after a\r\nstruggle of only a few hours, and on the evening of battle the\r\nimperialists already occupied the port of Prague, situated on the left\r\nbank of the Vltava (Moldau). King Frederick, who had lost all courage,\r\nhurriedly left Prague on the following morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Submission of Bohemia.\r\n\r\nBohemia itself, as well as the lands of the Bohemian crown, now\r\nsubmitted to Ferdinand almost without resistance. The battle of the\r\nWhite Hill marks an epoch in the history of Bohemia. The execution of\r\nthe principal leaders of the national movement (June 21, 1621) was\r\nfollowed by a system of wholesale confiscation of the lands of all who\r\nhad in any way participated in the national movement. Almost the entire\r\nancient nobility of Bohemia was driven into exile, and adventurers from\r\nall countries, mostly men who had served in the imperial army, shared\r\nthe spoils. Gradually all those who refused to recognize the creed of\r\nthe Roman church were expelled from Bohemia, and by the use of terrible\r\ncruelty Catholicism was entirely re-established in the country. In 1627\r\nFerdinand published a decree, which formally suppressed the ancient free\r\nconstitution of Bohemia, though a semblance of representative government\r\nwas left to the country. The new constitution proclaimed the heredity of\r\nthe Bohemian crown in the house of Habsburg. It added a new \"estate,\"\r\nthat of the clergy, to the three already existing. This estate, which\r\nwas to take precedence of all the others, consisted of the Roman\r\narchbishop of Prague and of all the ecclesiastics who were endowed with\r\nlanded estates. The diet was deprived of all legislative power, which\r\nwas exclusively vested in the sovereign. At its meetings the diet was to\r\ndiscuss such matters only as were laid before it by the representatives\r\nof the king. The estates continued to have the right of voting taxes,\r\nbut they were specially forbidden to attach any conditions to the grants\r\nof money which they made to their sovereign. It was finally decreed that\r\nthe German language should have equal right with the Bohemian one in all\r\nthe government offices and law-courts of the kingdom. This had indeed\r\nbecome a necessity, since, in consequence of the vast confiscations, the\r\ngreatest part of the land was in the hands of foreigners to whom the\r\nnational language was unknown. Though these enactments still left some\r\nautonomy to Bohemia, the country gradually lost all individuality. Its\r\nhistory from this moment to the beginning of the 19th century is but a\r\npart of the history of Austria (q.v.).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bohemia under Austrian domination.\r\n\r\nBohemia was the theatre of hostilities during a large part of the Thirty\r\nYears' War, which had begun in its capital. In 1631 the Saxons for a\r\ntime occupied a large part of Bohemia, and even attempted to\r\nre-establish Protestantism, During the later period of the Thirty Years'\r\nWar Bohemia was frequently pillaged by Swedish troops, and the taking of\r\npart of Prague by the Swedish general Konigsmark in 1648 was the last\r\nevent of the great war. The attempts of the Swedish envoys to obtain a\r\ncertain amount of toleration for the Bohemian Protestants proved\r\nfruitless, as the imperial representatives were inflexible on this\r\npoint. At the beginning of the 18th century the possibility of the\r\nextinction of the male line of the house of Habsburg arose. The estates\r\nof Bohemia, at a meeting that took place at Prague on the 16th of\r\nOctober 1720, sanctioned the female succession to the Bohemian throne\r\nand recognized the so-called Pragmatic Sanction which proclaimed the\r\nindivisibility of the Habsburg realm. The archduchess Maria Theresa, in\r\nwhose favour these enactments were made, none the less met with great\r\nopposition on the death of her father the emperor Charles VI. Charles,\r\nelector of Bavaria, raised claims to the Bohemian throne and invaded the\r\ncountry with a large army of Bavarian, French and Saxon troops. He\r\noccupied Prague, and a large part of the nobles and knights of Bohemia\r\ntook the oath of allegiance to him (December 19, 1741). The fortune of\r\nwar, however, changed shortly afterwards. Maria Theresa recovered\r\nBohemia and the other lands that had been under the rule of the house of\r\nHabsburg. During the reign of Maria Theresa, and to a greater extent\r\nduring that of her son Joseph II., many changes in the internal\r\nadministration of the Habsburg realm took place which all tended to\r\nlimit yet further the autonomy of Bohemia. A decree of 1749 abolished\r\nthe separate law-courts that still existed in Bohemia, and a few years\r\nlater an Austro-Bohemian chancellor was appointed who was to have the\r\ncontrol of the administration of Bohemia, as well as of the German\r\ndomains of the house of Habsburg. The power of the royal officials who\r\nconstituted the executive government of Bohemia was greatly curtailed,\r\nand though the chief representative of the sovereign in Prague continued\r\nto bear the ancient title of supreme burgrave, he was instructed to\r\nconform in all matters to the orders of the central government of\r\nVienna. Yet more extreme measures tending to centralization were\r\nintroduced by the emperor Joseph, who refused to be crowned at Prague as\r\nking of Bohemia. The powers of the Bohemian diet and of the royal\r\nofficials at Prague were yet further limited, and the German language\r\nwas introduced into all the upper schools of Bohemia. Some of the\r\nreforms introduced by Joseph were, incidentally and contrary to the\r\nwishes of their originator, favourable to the Bohemian nationality. Thus\r\nthe greater liberty which he granted to the press enabled the Bohemians\r\nto publish a newspaper in the national language. After the death of\r\nJoseph in 1790 the Bohemian estates, whose meetings had been suspended\r\nduring his reign, again assembled, but they at first made but scanty\r\nattempts to reassert their former rights. During the long Napoleonic\r\nwars, in which the house of Habsburg was almost continuously engaged,\r\nBohemia continued in its previous lethargic state. In 1804 a merely\r\nformal change in the constitutional position of Bohemia took place when\r\nFrancis I. assumed the hereditary title of emperor of Austria. It was\r\nstated in an imperial decree that the new title of the sovereign should\r\nin no way prejudice the ancient rights of Bohemia and that the\r\nsovereigns would continue to be crowned as kings of Bohemia.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Revival of national aspirations.\r\n\r\n  Collapse in 1848.\r\n\r\nAfter the re-establishment of European peace in 1815 the long-suppressed\r\nnational aspirations of Bohemia began to revive. The national movement,\r\nhowever, at first only found expression in the revival of Bohemian\r\nliterature. The arbitrary and absolutist government of Prince Metternich\r\nrendered all political action impossible in the lands ruled by the house\r\nof Habsburg. In spite of this pressure the estates of Bohemia began in\r\n1845 to assume an attitude of opposition to the government of Vienna.\r\nThey affirmed their right of voting the taxes of the country--a right\r\nthat was due to them according to the constitution of 1627. To obtain\r\nthe support of the wider classes of the population, they determined in\r\n1847 to propose at their session of the following year that the towns\r\nshould have a more extensive representation at the diet, that the\r\ncontrol of the estates over the finances of the country should be made\r\nmore stringent, and that the Bohemian language should be introduced into\r\nall the higher schools of the country. The revolutionary outbreak of\r\n1848 prevented this meeting of the estates. When the news of the\r\nFebruary revolution in Paris reached Prague the excitement there was\r\nvery great. On the 11th of March a vast public meeting voted a petition\r\nto the government of Vienna which demanded that the Bohemian language\r\nshould enjoy equal rights with the German in all the government offices\r\nof the country, that a general diet comprising all the Bohemian lands,\r\nbut elected on an extensive suffrage, should be convoked, and that\r\nnumerous liberal reforms should be introduced. The deputation which\r\npresented these demands in Vienna received a somewhat equivocal answer.\r\nIn reply, however, to a second deputation, the emperor Ferdinand\r\ndeclared on the 8th of April that equality of rights would be secured to\r\nboth nationalities in Bohemia, that the question of the reunion of\r\nMoravia and Silesia to Bohemia should be left to a general meeting of\r\nrepresentatives of all parts of Austria, and that a new meeting of the\r\nestates of Bohemia, which would include representatives of the principal\r\ntowns, would shortly be convoked. This assembly, which was to have had\r\nfull powers to create a new constitution, and which would have\r\nestablished complete autonomy, never met, though the election of its\r\nmembers took place on the 17th of May. In consequence of the general\r\nnational movement which is so characteristic of the year 1848, it was\r\ndecided to hold at Prague a \"Slavic congress\" to which Slavs of all\r\nparts of the Austrian empire, as well as those belonging to other\r\ncountries, were invited. The deliberations were interrupted by the\r\nserious riots that broke out in the streets of Prague on the 12th of\r\nJune. They were suppressed after prolonged fighting and considerable\r\nbloodshed. The Austrian commander, Prince Windischgratz, bombarded the\r\ncity, which finally capitulated unconditionally. The nationalist and\r\nliberal movement in Bohemia was thus suddenly checked, though the\r\nBohemians took part in the Austrian constituent assembly that met at\r\nVienna, and afterwards at Kromeriz (Kremsier).\r\n\r\nBy the end of the year 1849 all constitutional government had ceased in\r\nBohemia, as in all parts of the Habsburg empire. The reaction that now\r\nensued was felt more severely than in any other part of the monarchy;\r\nfor not only were all attempts to obtain self-government and liberty\r\nruthlessly suppressed, but a determined attempt was made to exterminate\r\nthe national language. The German language was again exclusively used in\r\nall schools and government offices, all Bohemian newspapers were\r\nsuppressed, and even the society of the Bohemian museum--a society\r\ncomposed of Bohemian noblemen and scholars--was for a time only allowed\r\nto hold its meetings under the supervision of the police.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Austrian constitutional changes.\r\n\r\nThe events of the Italian campaign of 1859 rendered the continuation of\r\nabsolutism in the Austrian empire impossible. It was attempted to\r\nestablish a constitutional system which, while maintaining to a certain\r\nextent the unity of the empire, should yet recognize the ancient\r\nconstitutional rights of some of the countries united under the rule of\r\nthe house of Habsburg. A decree published on the 20th of October 1860\r\nestablished diets with limited powers. The composition of these\r\nparliamentary assemblies was to a certain extent modelled on that of the\r\nancient diets of Bohemia and other parts of the empire. This decree was\r\nfavourably received in Bohemia, but the hopes which it raised in the\r\ncountry fell when a new imperial decree appeared on the 26th of February\r\n1861. This established a central parliament at Vienna with very\r\nextensive powers, and introduced an electoral system which was grossly\r\npartial to the Germans. The Bohemians indeed consented to send their\r\nrepresentatives to Vienna, but they left the parliament in 1863, stating\r\nthat the assembly had encroached on the power which constitutionally\r\nbelonged to the diet of Prague. Two years later the central parliament\r\nof Vienna was suspended, and in the following year--1866--the\r\nAustro-Prussian war caused a complete change in the constitutional\r\nposition of Bohemia. The congress of Vienna in 1815 had declared that\r\nthat country should form part of the newly formed Germanic\r\nConfederation; this was done without consulting the estates of the\r\ncountry, as had been customary even after the battle of the White Hill\r\non the occasion of serious constitutional changes. The treaty with\r\nPrussia, signed at Prague on the 23rd of August 1866, excluded from\r\nGermany all lands ruled by the house of Habsburg. As a natural\r\nconsequence German influence declined in the Austrian empire, and in\r\nBohemia in particular. While Hungary now obtained complete independence,\r\nthe new constitution of 1867, which applied only to the German and\r\nSlavic parts of the Habsburg empire, maintained the system of\r\ncentralization and attempted to maintain the waning German influence.\r\nThe Bohemians energetically opposed this new constitution and refused to\r\nsend representatives to Vienna.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Renewed struggles of Bohemian nationalism.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 it appeared probable for a moment that the wishes of the\r\nBohemians, who desired that their ancient constitution should be\r\nre-established in a modernized form, would be realized. The new Austrian\r\nprime minister, Count Karl Hohenwart, took office with the firm\r\nintention of accomplishing an agreement between Bohemia and the other\r\nparts of the Habsburg empire. Prolonged negotiations ensued, and an\r\nattempt was made to establish a constitutional system which, while\r\nsatisfying the claims of the Bohemians, would yet have firmly connected\r\nthem with the other lands ruled by the house of Habsburg. An imperial\r\nmessage addressed to the diet of Prague (September 14, 1871) stated that\r\nthe sovereign \"in consideration of the former constitutional position of\r\nBohemia and remembering the power and glory which its crown had given to\r\nhis ancestors, and the constant fidelity of its population, gladly\r\nrecognized the rights of the kingdom of Bohemia, and was willing to\r\nconfirm this assurance by taking the coronation oath.\" Various\r\ninfluences caused the failure of this attempt to reconcile Bohemia with\r\nAustria. In 1872 a government with a pronounced German tendency took\r\noffice in Vienna, and the Bohemians for a time again refused to attend\r\nthe parliamentary assemblies of Vienna and Prague. In 1879 Count Eduard\r\nTaaffe became Austrian prime minister, and he succeeded in persuading\r\nthe representatives of Bohemia to take part in the deliberations of the\r\nparliament of Vienna. They did so, after stating that they took this\r\nstep without prejudice to their view that Bohemia with Moravia and\r\nSilesia constituted a separate state under the rule of the same\r\nsovereign as Austria and Hungary. The government of Count Taaffe, in\r\nrecognition of this concession by the Bohemians, consented to remove\r\nsome of the grossest anomalies connected with the electoral system of\r\nBohemia, which had hitherto been grossly partial to the German minority\r\nof the population. The government of Count Taaffe also consented to the\r\nfoundation of a Bohemian university at Prague, which greatly contributed\r\nto the intellectual development of the country. On the fall of the\r\ngovernment of Count Taaffe, Prince Alfred Windischgratz became prime\r\nminister. The policy of his short-lived government was hostile to\r\nBohemia and he was soon replaced by Count Badeni.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The language question.\r\n\r\nBadeni again attempted to conciliate Bohemia. He did not indeed consider\r\nit feasible to reopen the question of its autonomy, but he endeavoured\r\nto remedy some of the most serious grievances of the country. In the\r\nbeginning of 1897 Count Badeni issued a decree which stated that after a\r\ncertain date all government officials who wished to be employed in\r\nBohemia would have to prove a certain knowledge of the Bohemian as well\r\nas of the German language. This decree met with violent opposition on\r\nthe part of the German inhabitants of Austria, and caused the fall of\r\nCount Badeni's cabinet at the end of the year 1897. After a brief\r\ninterval he was succeeded by Count Thun and then by Count Clary, whose\r\ngovernment repealed the decrees that had to a certain extent granted\r\nequal rights to the Bohemian language. In consequence troubles broke out\r\nin Prague, and were severely repressed by the Austrian authorities.\r\nDuring the subsequent ministries of Korber and Gautsch the Bohemians\r\ncontinued to oppose the central government of Vienna, and to assert\r\ntheir national rights.\r\n\r\n  See generally Count Lutzow, _Bohemia, a Historical Sketch_ (London,\r\n  1896). The valuable collection of historical documents entitled\r\n  _Fontes Rerum Bohemicarum_, published at Prague in the latter part of\r\n  the 19th century, has superseded earlier ones such as Freherus\r\n  (Marquard Freher), _Rerum Bohemicarum Antiqui Scriptores_. Similarly,\r\n  the earlier historical works of Pubitschka, Pelzl and De Florgy are\r\n  superseded by Frantisek Palacky's _Geschichte von Bohmen_ (Prague,\r\n  1844-1867), which, however, ends with the year 1526. Rezek, Gindely\r\n  and others have dealt with the history of Bohemia posterior to the\r\n  year 1526. Professor Adolf Bachmann published (vol. i. in 1899, vol.\r\n  ii. 1905) a _Geschichte Bohmens_ up to 1526, which has a strongly\r\n  marked German tendency. Of French works Professor Ernest Denis's _Jean\r\n  Hus, et la guerre des Hussites_ (Paris, 1878), _Fin de l'independance\r\n  boheme_ (2 vols., 1890), and _La Boheme depuis la Montagne Blanche_ (2\r\n  vols., 1903), give a continuous account of Bohemian history from the\r\n  beginning of the 15th century.     (L.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE\r\n\r\nThe earliest records of the Bohemian or Czech language are very ancient,\r\nthough the so-called MSS. of Zelena Hora (Gruneberg) and Kralodvur\r\n(Koniginhof) are almost certainly forgeries of the early part of the\r\n19th century. The earliest genuine documents of the Bohemian language\r\ncomprise several hymns and legends; of the latter the legend of St\r\nCatherine and that of St Dorothy have the greatest value. Several\r\nancient epic fragments have also been preserved, such as the\r\n_Alexandreis_ and _Tandarias a Floribella_. These and other early\r\nBohemian writings have been printed since the revival of Bohemian\r\nliterature in the 19th century. Of considerable historical value is the\r\nrhymed chronicle generally though wrongly known as the chronicle of\r\nDalimil. The author, who probably lived during the reign of King John\r\n(1310-1346), records the events of Bohemian history from the earliest\r\nperiod to the reign of King Henry of Carinthia, the immediate\r\npredecessor of John. A strong feeling of racial antipathy to the\r\nGermans pervades the chronicle.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Old Czech literature.\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly to be attributed to the high intellectual level which\r\nBohemia attained in the 14th century that at that period we already find\r\nwriters on religious and philosophical subjects who used the national\r\nlanguage. Of these the most important is Thomas of Stitny (c.\r\n1331-1401). Of his works, which contain many ideas similar to those of\r\nhis contemporary Wycliffe, those entitled _O obecnych vecech\r\nKrestanskych_ (on general Christian matters) and _Besedni reci_ (in a\r\nrough translation \"learned entertainments\") have most value. Stitny and\r\nsome of his contemporaries whose Bohemian writings have perished are\r\nknown as the forerunners of Huss. Huss, like many of his contemporaries\r\nin Bohemia, wrote both in Bohemian and in Latin. Of the Bohemian\r\nwritings of Huss, who contributed greatly to the development of his\r\nnative language, the most important is his _Vyklad viry, desatera Boziho\r\nprikazani, a patere_ (exposition of the creed, the ten commandments and\r\nthe Lord's Prayer) written in 1412. Of his numerous other Bohemian works\r\nwe may mention the _Postilla_ (collection of sermons), the treatises _O\r\npoznani cesty prave k spaseni_ (the true road to salvation) and _O\r\nsvatokupectvi_ (on simony), and a large collection of letters; those\r\nwritten in prison are very touching.\r\n\r\nThe years that followed the death of Huss formed in Bohemia a period of\r\nincessant theological strife. The anti-Roman or Hussite movement was\r\nlargely a democratic one, and it is therefore natural that the national\r\nlanguage rather than Latin should have been used in the writings that\r\nbelong to this period. Unfortunately in consequence of the systematic\r\ndestruction of all Bohemian writings which took place through the agency\r\nof the Jesuits, after the battle of the White Hill (1620), a large part\r\nof this controversial literature has perished. Thus the writings of the\r\nmembers of the extreme Hussite party, the so-called Taborites, have been\r\nentirely destroyed. Of the writings of the more moderate Hussites, known\r\nas the Calixtines or Utraquists, some have been preserved. Such are the\r\nbooks entitled _Of the Great Torment of the Holy Church_ and the _Lives\r\nof the Priests of Tabor_, written in a sense violently hostile to that\r\ncommunity. A Bohemian work by Archbishop John of Rokycan has also been\r\npreserved; it is entitled _Postilla_ and is similar though inferior to\r\nthe work of Huss that bears the same name.\r\n\r\nA quite independent religious writer who belongs to the period of the\r\nHussite wars is Peter Chelcicky (born in the last years of the 14th\r\ncentury, died 1460), who may be called the Tolstoy of the 15th. His\r\ndominant ideas were horror of bloodshed and the determination to accept\r\nunresistingly all, even unjust, decrees of the worldly authorities.\r\nThough a strenuous enemy of the Church of Rome, Chelcicky joined none of\r\nthe Hussite parties. His masterpiece is the _Sit viry_ (the net of\r\nfaith). Among his other works his _Postilla_ and polemical writings in\r\nthe form of letters to Archbishop John of Rokycan and Bishop Nicolas of\r\nPelhrimov deserve mention.\r\n\r\nThe Hussite period is rather poor in historical works written in the\r\nlanguage of the country. We should, however, mention some chroniclers\r\nwho were contemporaries and sometimes eye-witnesses of the events of the\r\nHussite wars. Their writings have been collected and published by\r\nFrantisek Palacky under the title of _Stare ceske letopisy_.\r\n\r\nIn the 16th century when Bohemia was in a state of comparative\r\ntranquillity, the native literature was largely developed. Besides the\r\nwriters of the community of the Bohemian Brethren, we meet at this\r\nperiod with three historians of merit. Of these far the best-known is\r\nWenceslas Hajek of Libocan. The year of his birth is uncertain, but we\r\nread of him as a priest in 1524; he died in 1553. His great work\r\n_Kronika ceska_ was dedicated to the emperor Ferdinand I., king of\r\nBohemia, and appeared under the auspices of government officials. It has\r\ntherefore a strong dynastic and Romanist tendency, and its circulation\r\nwas permitted even at the time when most Bohemian books were prohibited\r\nand many totally destroyed. Hajek's book was translated into several\r\nlanguages and frequently quoted. We find such second-hand quotations\r\neven in the works of many writers who had probably never heard of Hajek.\r\nHis book is, however, inaccurate and grossly partial. Very little known\r\non the other hand are the works of Bartos, surnamed \"pisar\" (the\r\nwriter), as he was for many years employed as secretary by the city of\r\nPrague, and those of Sixt of Ottersdorf. The work of Bartos (or\r\nBartholomew) entitled the _Chronicle of Prague_ has great historical\r\nvalue. He describes the troubles that befell Prague and Bohemia\r\ngenerally during the reign of the weak and absentee sovereign King\r\nLouis. The year of the birth of Bartos is uncertain, but it is known\r\nthat he died in 1539. The somewhat later work of Sixt of Ottersdorf\r\n(1500-1583) deals with a short but very important episode in the history\r\nof Bohemia. It is entitled _Memorials of the Troubled Years 1546 and\r\n1547_. The book describes the unsuccessful rising of the Bohemians\r\nagainst Ferdinand I. of Austria. Sixt took a considerable part in this\r\nmovement, a fact that greatly enhances the value of his book.\r\n\r\nThough the life of Chelcicky, who has already been mentioned, was an\r\nisolated one, he is undoubtedly the indirect founder of the community of\r\nthe \"Bohemian Brethren,\" who greatly influenced Bohemian literature.\r\nAlmost all their historical and theological works were written in the\r\nnational language, which through their influence became far more refined\r\nand polished. Before referring to some of the writings of members of the\r\ncommunity we should mention the famed translation of the Scriptures\r\nknown as the _Bible of Kralice_. It was the joint work of several\r\ndivines of the brotherhood, and was first printed at Kralice in Moravia\r\nin 1593. Brother Gregory, surnamed the patriarch of the brotherhood, has\r\nleft a large number of writings dealing mainly with theological matters.\r\nMost important are the _Letters to Archbishop Rokycan_ and the book _On\r\ngood and evil priests_. After the death of Brother Gregory in 1480\r\ndiscord broke out in the community, and it resulted in very great\r\nliterary activity. Brothers Lucas, Blahoslav and Jaffet, as well as\r\nAugusta, a bishop of the community, have left us numerous controversial\r\nworks. Very interesting is the account of the captivity of Bishop\r\nAugusta, written by his companion the young priest Jan Bilek. We have\r\nevidence that numerous historical works written by members of the\r\nbrotherhood existed, but most of them perished in the 17th century when\r\nnearly all anti-Roman books written in Bohemia were destroyed. Thus only\r\nfragments of Blahoslav's _History of the Unity_ (i.e. the brotherhood)\r\nhave been preserved. One of the historians of the brotherhood, Wenceslas\r\nBrezan, wrote a _History of the House of Rosenberg_, of which only the\r\nbiographies of William and Peter of Rosenberg have been preserved. The\r\ngreatest writer of the brotherhood is John Amos Komensky or Comenius\r\n(1592-1670). Of his many works written in his native language the most\r\nimportant is his _Labyrinth of the World_, an allegorical tale which is\r\nperhaps the most famous work written in Bohemian.[4] Many of the\r\nnumerous devotional and educational writings of Comenius,--his works\r\nnumber 142,--are also written in his native tongue.\r\n\r\nThe year 1620, which witnessed the downfall of Bohemian independence,\r\nalso marks the beginning of a period of decline of the national tongue,\r\nwhich indeed later, in the 18th century, was almost extinct as a written\r\nlanguage. Yet we must notice besides Comenius two other writers, both\r\nhistorians, whose works belong to a date later than 1620. Of these one\r\nwas an adherent of the nationalist, the other of the imperialist party.\r\nPaul Skala ze Zhore (1582-c. 1640) was an official in the service of the\r\n\"winter king\" Frederick of the Palatinate. He for a time followed his\r\nsovereign into exile, and spent the last years of his life at Freiberg\r\nin Saxony. It was at this period of his life, after his political\r\nactivity had ceased, that he wrote his historical works. His first work\r\nwas a short book which is a mere series of chronological tables.\r\nSomewhat later he undertook a vast work entitled _Histoire cirkevni_\r\n(history of the church). In spite of its title the book, which consists\r\nof ten enormous MS. volumes, deals as much with political as with\r\necclesiastical matters. The most valuable part, that dealing with events\r\nof 1602 to 1623, of which Skala writes as a contemporary and often as an\r\neye-witness, has been edited and published by Prof. Tieftrunk. A\r\ncontemporary and a political opponent of Skala was William Count Slavata\r\n(1572-1652). He was a faithful servant of the house of Habsburg, and one\r\nof the government officials who were thrown from the windows of the\r\nHradcany palace in 1618, at the beginning of the Bohemian uprising. In\r\n1637 Slavata published his _Pamety_ (memoirs) which deal exclusively\r\nwith the events of the years 1618 and 1619, in which he had played so\r\ngreat a part. During the leisure of the last years of his long life\r\nSlavata composed a vast work entitled _Historicke Spisovani_ (historical\r\nworks). It consists of fourteen large MS. volumes, two of which contain\r\nthe previously-written memoirs. These two volumes have recently been\r\nedited and published by Dr Jos. Jirecek.\r\n\r\n\r\n  19th-century revival.\r\n\r\nAfter the deaths of Skala, Slavata and Comenius, no works of any\r\nimportance were written in the Bohemian language for a considerable\r\nperiod, and the new Austrian government endeavoured in every way to\r\ndiscourage the use of that language. A change took place when the\r\nromantic movement started at the beginning of the 19th century. The\r\nearly revival of the Bohemian language was very modest, and at first\r\nalmost exclusively translations from foreign languages were published.\r\nThe first writer who again drew attention to the then almost forgotten\r\nBohemian language was Joseph Dobrovsky (1753-1829). His works, which\r\ninclude a grammar of the Bohemian language and a history of Bohemian\r\nliterature, were mostly written in German or Latin, and his only\r\nBohemian works are some essays which he contributed to the early numbers\r\nof the _Casopis Musea Kralovstvi Ceskeho_ (Journal of the Bohemian\r\nMuseum) and a collection of letters.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, to four men belonging to a time somewhat subsequent to\r\nthat of Dobrovsky that the revival of the language and literature of\r\nBohemia is mainly due. They are Jungmann, Kolar, Safarik and Palacky.\r\nJoseph Jungmann (1773-1847) published early in life numerous Bohemian\r\ntranslations of German and English writers. His most important works are\r\nhis _Dejepes literatury ceska_ (history of Bohemian literature), and his\r\nmonumental German and Bohemian dictionary, which largely contributed to\r\nthe development of the Bohemian language. John Kolar (1793-1852) was the\r\ngreatest poet of the Bohemian revival, and it is only in quite recent\r\ndays that Bohemian poetry has risen to a higher level. Kolar's principal\r\npoem is the _Slavy dcera_ (daughter of Slavia), a personification of the\r\nSlavic race. Its principal importance at the present time consists\r\nrather in the part it played in the revival of Bohemian literature than\r\nin its artistic value. Kolar's other works are mostly philological\r\nstudies. Paul Joseph Safarik (1795-1861) was a very fruitful writer. His\r\n_Starozitnosti Slovanske_ (Slavic antiquities), an attempt to record the\r\nthen almost unknown history and literature of the early Slavs, has still\r\nconsiderable value. Francis Palacky (1798-1876) is undoubtedly the\r\ngreatest of Bohemian historians. Among his many works his history of\r\nBohemia from the earliest period to the year 1526 is the most important.\r\n\r\nOther Bohemian writers whose work belongs mainly to the earlier part of\r\nthe 19th century are the poets Francis Ladislav Celakovsky, author of\r\nthe _Ruze stolistova_ (the hundred-leaved rose), Erben, Macha, Tyl, to\r\nmention but a few of the most famous writers. The talented writer Karel\r\nHavlicek, the founder of Bohemian journalism, deserves special notice.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the 19th century, and particularly after the\r\nfoundation of the national university in 1882, Bohemian literature has\r\ndeveloped to an extent that few perhaps foresaw. Of older writers Bozena\r\nNemceva, whose _Babicka_ has been translated into many languages, and\r\nBenes Trebizky, author of many historical novels, should be named. John\r\nNeruda (1834-1891) was a very fruitful and talented writer both of\r\npoetry and of prose. Perhaps the most valuable of his many works is his\r\nphilosophical epic entitled _Kosmicke basne_ (cosmic poems). Julius\r\nZeyer (1841-1901) also wrote much both in prose and in verse. His epic\r\npoem entitled _Vysehrad_, which celebrates the ancient glory of the\r\nacropolis of Prague, has great value, and of his many novels _Jan Maria\r\nPlojhar_ has had the greatest success. Of later Bohemian poets the best\r\nare Adolf Heyduk, Svatopluk Cech and Jaroslav Vrchlicky (b. 1853). Of\r\nSvatopluk Cech's many poems, which are all inspired by national\r\nenthusiasm, _Vaclav z Michalovic, Lesetinsky Kovar_ (the smith of\r\nLesetin) and _Basne otroka_ (the songs of a slave) are the most notable.\r\nWhile Vrchlicky (pseudonym of Emil Frida) has no less strong patriotic\r\nfeelings, he has been more catholic in the choice of the subjects of his\r\nmany works, both in poetry and in prose. Of his many collections of\r\nlyric poems _Rok na jihu_ (a year in the south), _Poute k Eldoradu_\r\n(pilgrimages to Eldorado) and _Sonety Samotare_ (sonnets of a recluse)\r\nhave particular value. Vrchlicky is also a very brilliant dramatist.\r\nBohemian novelists have become very numerous. Mention should be made of\r\nAlois Jirasek, also a distinguished dramatic author; Jacob Arbes, whose\r\n_Romanetta_ have great merit; and Vaclav Hladik, whose _Evzen Voldan_ is\r\na very striking representation of the life of modern Prague. Like so\r\nmany Bohemian authors, Hladik also is a copious dramatic author.\r\n\r\nBohemia has been very fruitful in historic writers. Wenceslas Tomek\r\n(1818-1905) left many historical works, of which his _Dejepis miesta\r\nPrahy_ (history of the town of Prague) is the most important. Jaroslav\r\nGoll (b. 1846) is the author of many historical works, especially on the\r\ncommunity of the Bohemian Brethren. Professor Joseph Kalousek has\r\nwritten much on the early history of Bohemia, and is also the author of\r\na very valuable study of the ancient constitution (_Statni pravo_) of\r\nBohemia. Dr Anton Rezek is the author of important historical studies,\r\nmany of which appeared in the Journal of the Bohemian Museum and in the\r\n_Cesky Casopis Historicky_ (Bohemian Historical Review), which he\r\nfounded in 1895 jointly with Professor Jaroslav Goll. More recently Dr\r\nVaclav Flajshans has published some excellent studies on the life and\r\nwritings of John Huss, and Professors Pic and Niederle have published\r\nlearned archaeological studies on the earliest period of Bohemian\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n  See Count Lutzow, _A History of Bohemian Literature_ (London, 1899);\r\n  W.R. Morfill, _Slavonic Literature_ (1883); A.N. Pypin and V.D.\r\n  Spasovic, _History of Slavonic Literature_ (written in Russian,\r\n  translated into German by Trangott Pech, _Gesch. der slav.\r\n  Literaturen_, 2 vols., Leipzig, 1880-1884). There are modern histories\r\n  of Bohemian literature written in the national language by Dr Karel\r\n  Tieftrunk, Dr Vaclav Flajshans and Mr Jaroslav Vlaek.     (L.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] As a guide to the English-speaking reader, the following notes on\r\n    the pronunciation of Bohemian names are appended. The Czech (Cech)\r\n    alphabet is the same as the English, with the omission of the letters\r\n    q, w and x. Certain letters, however, vary in pronunciation, and are\r\n    distinguished by diacritical marks, a device orginated by John Huss.\r\n    The vowels a, e, i, (y), o, u, are pronounced as in Italian; but e =\r\n    Eng. ye in \"yet,\" and [ou] = Eng. oo.\r\n\r\n    The consonants, b, d, f, k, l, m, n, p, r, v, z, are as in English; g\r\n    = Eng. g in \"gone\"; s = Eng. initial s. But n = Span. n (in _canon_);\r\n    r = rsh; s = sh; z = zh (i.e. the French j); k before d = g; v before\r\n    k, p, s, t = f. Of the other consonants c = Eng. ts; c = ch; ch =\r\n    Germ. ch; j = Eng. y, but is not pronounced before d, m, s. Accents\r\n    on vowels lengthen them; on d and t they are softening marks. H is\r\n    always pronounced in Czech. At the end of words and before k and t it\r\n    = Germ, ch; in other places, as in _bahno_ (morass) its pronunciation\r\n    is somewhat softer.\r\n\r\n  [2] _Protestatio Bohemorum_, frequently printed in English and\r\n    German, as well as in the Latin original.\r\n\r\n  [3] Laurence of Brezova's (contemporary) _Kronika Husitska_.\r\n\r\n  [4] This work has been translated into English by Count Lutzow for\r\n    the \"Temple Classics.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOHEMUND, the name of a series of princes of Antioch, afterwards counts\r\nof Tripoli.

III.\r\n                         Hugh II.                Bohemund VII.--_o.s.p._\r\n\r\nBOHEMUND I. (c. A.D. 1058-1111), prince of Otranto and afterwards of\r\nAntioch, whose first name was Marc, was the eldest son of Robert\r\nGuiscard, _dux Apuliae et Calabriae_, by an early marriage contracted\r\nbefore 1059. He served under his father in the great attack on the East\r\nRoman empire (1080-1085), and commanded the Normans during Guiscard's\r\nabsence (1082-1084), penetrating into Thessaly as far as Larissa, but\r\nbeing repulsed by Alexius Comnenus. This early hostility to Alexius had\r\na great influence in determining the course of his future career, and\r\nthereby helped to determine the history of the First Crusade, of which\r\nBohemund may be regarded as the leader. On the death of Guiscard in\r\n1085, his younger son Roger, born \"in the purple\" of a Lombard princess\r\nSicelgaeta, succeeded to the duchy of Apulia and Calabria, and a war\r\narose between Bohemund (whom his father had destined for the throne of\r\nConstantinople) and Duke Roger. The war was finally composed by the\r\nmediation of Urban II. and the award of Otranto and other possessions to\r\nBohemund. In 1096 Bohemund, along with his uncle the great count of\r\nSicily, was attacking Amalfi, which had revolted against Duke Roger,\r\nwhen bands of crusaders began to pass, on their way through Italy to\r\nConstantinople. The zeal of the crusader came upon Bohemund: it is\r\npossible, too, that he saw in the First Crusade a chance of realizing\r\nhis father's policy (which was also an old Norse instinct) of the _Drang\r\nnach Osten_, and hoped from the first to carve for himself an eastern\r\nprincipality. He gathered a fine Norman army (perhaps the finest\r\ndivision in the crusading host), at the head of which he crossed the\r\nAdriatic, and penetrated to Constantinople along the route he had tried\r\nto follow in 1082-1084. He was careful to observe a \"correct\" attitude\r\ntowards Alexius, and when he arrived at Constantinople in April 1097 he\r\ndid homage to the emperor. He may have negotiated with Alexius about a\r\nprincipality at Antioch; if he did so, he had little encouragement. From\r\nConstantinople to Antioch Bohemund was the real leader of the First\r\nCrusade; and it says much for his leading that the First Crusade\r\nsucceeded in crossing Asia Minor, which the Crusades of 1101, 1147 and\r\n1189 failed to accomplish. A _politique_, Bohemund was resolved to\r\nengineer the enthusiasm of the crusaders to his own ends; and when his\r\nnephew Tancred left the main army at Heraclea, and attempted to\r\nestablish a footing in Cilicia, the movement may have been already\r\nintended as a preparation for Bohemund's eastern principality. Bohemund\r\nwas the first to get into position before Antioch (October 1097), and he\r\ntook a great part in the siege, beating off the Mahommedan attempts at\r\nrelief from the east, and connecting the besiegers on the west with the\r\nport of St Simeon and the Italian ships which lay there. The capture of\r\nAntioch was due to his connexion with Firuz, one of the commanders in\r\nthe city; but he would not bring matters to an issue until the\r\npossession of the city was assured him (May 1098), under the terror of\r\nthe approach of Kerbogha with a great army of relief, and with a\r\nreservation in favour of Alexius, if Alexius should fulfil his promise\r\nto aid the crusaders. But Bohemund was not secure in the possession of\r\nAntioch, even after its surrender and the defeat of Kerbogha; he had to\r\nmake good his claims against Raymund of Toulouse, who championed the\r\nrights of Alexius. He obtained full possession in January 1099, and\r\nstayed in the neighbourhood of Antioch to secure his position, while the\r\nother crusaders moved southward to the capture of Jerusalem. He came to\r\nJerusalem at Christmas 1099, and had Dagobert of Pisa elected as\r\npatriarch, perhaps in order to check the growth of a strong Lotharingian\r\npower in the city. It might seem in 1100 that Bohemund was destined to\r\nfound a great principality in Antioch, which would dwarf Jerusalem; he\r\nhad a fine territory, a good strategical position and a strong army. But\r\nhe had to face two great forces--the East Roman empire, which claimed\r\nthe whole of his territories and was supported in its claim by Raymund\r\nof Toulouse, and the strong Mahommedan principalities in the north-east\r\nof Syria. Against these two forces he failed. In 1100 he was captured by\r\nDanishmend of Sivas, and he languished in prison till 1103. Tancred took\r\nhis place; but meanwhile Raymund established himself with the aid of\r\nAlexius in Tripoli, and was able to check the expansion of Antioch to\r\nthe south. Ransomed in 1103 by the generosity of an Armenian prince,\r\nBohemund made it his first object to attack the neighbouring Mahommedan\r\npowers in order to gain supplies. But in heading an attack on Harran, in\r\n1104, he was severely defeated at Balich, near Rakka on the Euphrates.\r\nThe defeat was decisive; it made impossible the great eastern\r\nprincipality which Bohemund had contemplated. It was followed by a Greek\r\nattack on Cilicia; and despairing of his own resources, Bohemund\r\nreturned to Europe for reinforcements in order to defend his position.\r\nHis attractive personality won him the hand of Constance, the daughter\r\nof the French king, Philip I., and he collected a large army. Dazzled by\r\nhis success, he resolved to use his army not to defend Antioch against\r\nthe Greeks, but to attack Alexius. He did so; but Alexius, aided by the\r\nVenetians, proved too strong, and Bohemund had to submit to a\r\nhumiliating peace (1108), by which he became the vassal of Alexius,\r\nconsented to receive his pay, with the title of _Sebastos_, and promised\r\nto cede disputed territories and to admit a Greek patriarch into\r\nAntioch. Henceforth Bohemund was a broken man. He died without returning\r\nto the East, and was buried at Canossa in Apulia, in 1111.\r\n\r\n  LITERATURE.--The anonymous _Gesta Francorum_ (edited by H. Hagenmeyer)\r\n  is written by one of Bohemund's followers; and the _Alexiad_ of Anna\r\n  Comnena is a primary authority for the whole of his life. His career\r\n  is discussed by B. von Kugler, _Bohemund und Tancred_ (Tubingen,\r\n  1862); while L. von Heinemann, _Geschichte der Normannen in Sicilien\r\n  und Unteritalien_ (Leipzig, 1894), and R. Rohricht, _Geschichte des\r\n  ersten Kreuzzuges_ (Innsbruck, 1901), and _Geschichte des Konigreichs\r\n  Jerusalem_ (Innsbruck, 1898), may also be consulted for his history.\r\n\r\nBOHEMUND II. (1108-1131), son of the great Bohemund by his marriage with\r\nConstance of France, was born in 1108, the year of his father's defeat\r\nat Durazzo. In 1126 he came from Apulia to Antioch (which, since the\r\nfall of Roger, the successor of Tancred, in 1119, had been under the\r\nregency of Baldwin II.); and in 1127 he married Alice, the younger\r\ndaughter of Baldwin. After some trouble with Joscelin of Edessa, and\r\nafter joining with Baldwin II. in an attack on Damascus (1127), he was\r\ndefeated and slain on his northern frontier by a Mahommedan army from\r\nAleppo (1131). He had shown that he had his father's courage: if time\r\nhad sufficed, he might have shown that he had the other qualities of the\r\nfirst Bohemund.\r\n\r\nBOHEMUND III. was the son of Constance, daughter of Bohemund II., by her\r\nfirst husband, Raymund of Antioch. He succeeded his mother in the\r\nprincipality of Antioch in 1163, and first appears prominently in 1164,\r\nas regent of the kingdom of Jerusalem during the expedition of Amalric\r\nI. to Egypt. During the absence of Amalric, he was defeated and captured\r\nby Nureddin (August 1164) at Harenc, to the east of Antioch. He was at\r\nonce ransomed by his brother-in-law, the emperor Manuel, and went to\r\nConstantinople, whence he returned with a Greek patriarch. In 1180 he\r\ndeserted his second wife, the princess Orguilleuse, for a certain\r\nSibylla, and he was in consequence excommunicated. By Orguilleuse he had\r\nhad two sons, Raymund and Bohemund (the future Bohemund IV.), whose\r\nrelations and actions determined the rest of his life. Raymund married\r\nAlice, a daughter of the Armenian prince Rhupen (Rupin), brother of Leo\r\nof Armenia, and died in 1197, leaving behind him a son, Raymund Rhupen.\r\nBohemund, the younger brother of Raymund, had succeeded the last count\r\nof Tripoli in the possession of that county, 1187; and the problem which\r\noccupied the last years of Bohemund III. was to determine whether his\r\ngrandson, Raymund Rhupen, or his younger son, Bohemund, should succeed\r\nhim in Antioch. Leo of Armenia was naturally the champion of his\r\ngreat-nephew, Raymund Rhupen; indeed he had already claimed Antioch in\r\nhis own right, before the marriage of his niece to Raymund, in 1194,\r\nwhen he had captured Bohemund III. at Gastin, and attempted without\r\nsuccess to force him to cede Antioch.[1] Bohemund the younger, however,\r\nprosecuted his claim with vigour, and even evicted his father from\r\nAntioch about 1199: but he was ousted by Leo (now king of Armenia by\r\nthe grace of the emperor, Henry VI.), and Bohemund III. died in\r\npossession of his principality (1201).\r\n\r\nBOHEMUND IV., younger son of Bohemund III. by his second wife\r\nOrguilleuse, became count of Tripoli in 1187, and succeeded his father\r\nin the principality of Antioch, to the exclusion of Raymund Rhupen, in\r\n1201. But the dispute lasted for many years (Leo of Armenia continuing\r\nto champion the cause of his great-nephew), and long occupied the\r\nattention of Innocent III. Bohemund IV. enjoyed the support of the\r\nTemplars (who, like the Knights of St John, had estates in Tripoli) and\r\nof the Greek inhabitants of Antioch, to whom he granted their own\r\npatriarch in 1207, while Leo appealed (1210-1211) both to Innocent III.\r\nand the emperor Otto IV., and was supported by the Hospitallers. In 1216\r\nLeo captured Antioch, and established Raymund Rhupen as its prince; but\r\nhe lost it again in less than four years, and it was once more in the\r\npossession of Bohemund IV. when Leo died in 1220. Raymund Rhupen died in\r\n1221; and after the event Bohemund reigned in Antioch and Tripoli till\r\nhis death, proving himself a determined enemy of the Hospitallers, and\r\nthereby incurring excommunication in 1230. He first joined, and then\r\ndeserted, the emperor Frederick II., during the crusade of 1228-29; and\r\nhe was excluded from the operation of the treaty of 1229. When he died\r\nin 1233, he had just concluded peace with the Hospitallers, and Gregory\r\nIX. had released him from the excommunication of 1230.\r\n\r\nBOHEMUND V., son of Bohemund IV. by his wife Plaisance (daughter of Hugh\r\nof Gibelet), succeeded his father in 1233. He was prince of Antioch and\r\ncount of Tripoli, like his father; and like him he enjoyed the alliance\r\nof the Templars and experienced the hostility of Armenia, which was not\r\nappeased till 1251, when the mediation of St Louis, and the marriage of\r\nthe future Bohemund VI. to the sister of the Armenian king, finally\r\nbrought peace. By his first marriage in 1225 with Alice, the widow of\r\nHugh I. of Cyprus, Bohemund V. connected the history of Antioch for a\r\ntime with that of Cyprus. He died in 1251. He had resided chiefly at\r\nTripoli, and under him Antioch was left to be governed by its bailiff\r\nand commune.\r\n\r\nBOHEMUND VI. was the son of Bohemund V. by Luciana, a daughter of the\r\ncount of Segni, nephew of Innocent III. Born in 1237, Bohemund VI.\r\nsucceeded his father in 1251, and was knighted by St Louis in 1252. His\r\nsister Plaisance had married in 1250 Henry I. of Cyprus, the son of Hugh\r\nI.; and the Cypriot connexion of Antioch, originally formed by the\r\nmarriage of Bohemund V. and Alice, the widow of Hugh I., was thus\r\nmaintained. In 1252 Bohemund VI. established himself in Antioch, leaving\r\nTripoli to itself, and in 1257 he procured the recognition of his\r\nnephew, Hugh II., the son of Henry I. by Plaisance, as king of\r\nJerusalem. He allied himself to the Mongols against the advance of the\r\nEgyptian sultan; but in 1268 he lost Antioch to Bibars, and when he died\r\nin 1275 he was only count of Tripoli.\r\n\r\nBOHEMUND VII., son of Bohemund VI. by Sibylla, sister of Leo III. of\r\nArmenia, succeeded to the county of Tripoli in 1275, with his mother as\r\nregent. In his short and troubled reign he had trouble with the Templars\r\nwho were established in Tripoli; and in the very year of his death\r\n(1287) he lost Laodicea to the sultan of Egypt. He died without issue;\r\nand as, within two years of his death, Tripoli was captured, the county\r\nof Tripoli may be said to have become extinct with him.\r\n\r\n  LITERATURE.--The history of the Bohemunds is the history of the\r\n  principality of Antioch, and, after Bohemund IV., of the county of\r\n  Tripoli also. For Antioch, we possess its _Assises_ (Venice, 1876);\r\n  and two articles on its history have appeared in the _Revue de\r\n  l'Orient Latin_ (Paris, 1893, fol.), both by E. Rey (\"Resume\r\n  chronologique de l'histpire des princes d'Antioche,\" vol. iv., and\r\n  \"Les dignitaires de la principaute d'Antioche,\" vol. viii.). R.\r\n  Rohricht, _Geschichte des Konigreichs Jerusalem_ (Innsbruck, 1898),\r\n  gives practically all that is known about the history of Antioch and\r\n  Tripoli.     (E. Br.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] During the captivity of Bohemund III. the patriarch of Antioch\r\n    helped to found a commune, which persisted, with its mayor and\r\n    _jurats_, during the 13th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOHMER, JOHANN FRIEDRICH (1795-1863), German historian, son of Karl\r\nLudwig Bohmer (d. 1817), was born at Frankfort-on-Main on the 22nd of\r\nApril 1795. Educated at the universities of Heidelberg and Gottingen, he\r\nshowed an interest in art and visited Italy; but returning to Frankfort\r\nhe turned his attention to the study of history, and became secretary\r\nof the _Gesellschaft fur altere deutsche Geschichtskunde_. He was also\r\narchivist and then librarian of the city of Frankfort. Bohmer had a\r\ngreat dislike of Prussia and the Protestant faith, and a corresponding\r\naffection for Austria and the Roman Catholic Church, to which, however,\r\nhe did not belong. His critical sense was, perhaps, somewhat warped; but\r\nhis researches are of great value to students. He died unmarried, at\r\nFrankfort, on the 22nd of October 1863. Bohmer's historical work was\r\nchiefly concerned with collecting and tabulating charters and other\r\nimperial documents of the middle ages. First appeared an abstract, the\r\n_Regesta chronologico-diplomatica regum atque imperatorum Romanorum\r\n911-1313_ (Frankfort, 1831), which was followed by the _Regesta\r\nchronologico-diplomatica Karolorum. Die Urkunden samtlicher Karolinger\r\nin kurzen Auszugen_ (Frankfort, 1833), and a series of _Regesta\r\nimperii_. For the period 1314-1347 (Frankfort, 1839) the _Regesta_ was\r\nfollowed by three, and for the period 1246-1313 (Frankfort, 1844) by two\r\nsupplementary volumes. The remaining period of the _Regesta_, as edited\r\nby Bohmer, is 1198-1254 (Stuttgart, 1849). These collections contain\r\nintroductions and explanatory passages by the author. Very valuable also\r\nis the _Fontes rerum Germanicarum_ (Stuttgart, 1843-1868), a collection\r\nof original authorities for German history during the 13th and 14th\r\ncenturies. The fourth and last volume of this work was edited by A.\r\nHuber after the author's death. Other collections edited by Bohmer are:\r\n_Die Reichsgesetze 900-1400_ (Frankfort, 1832); _Wittelsbachische\r\nRegesten von der Erwerbung des Herzogtums Bayern bis zu 1340_\r\n(Stuttgart, 1854); and _Codex diplomaticus Moeno-Francofurtanus.\r\nUrkundenbuch der Reichsstadt Frankfurt_ (Frankfort, 1836; new edition by\r\nF. Law, 1901). Other volumes and editions of the _Regesta imperii_,\r\nedited by J. Ficker, E. Muhlbacher, E. Winkelmann and others, are\r\nlargely based on Bohmer's work. Bohmer left a great amount of\r\nunpublished material, and after his death two other works were published\r\nfrom his papers: _Acta imperii selecta_, edited by J. Ficker (Innsbruck,\r\n1870); and _Regesta archiepiscoporum Maguntinensium_, edited by C. Will\r\n(Innsbruck, 1877-1886).\r\n\r\n  See J. Janssen, _J.F. Bohmers Leben, Briefe und kleinere Schriften_\r\n  (Freiburg, 1868).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOHN, HENRY GEORGE (1796-1884), British publisher, son of a German\r\nbookbinder settled in England, was born in London on the 4th of January\r\n1796. In 1831 he started as a dealer in rare books and \"remainders.\" In\r\n1841 he issued his \"Guinea\" Catalogue of books, a monumental work\r\ncontaining 23,208 items. Bohn was noted for his book auction sales: one\r\nheld in 1848 lasted four days, the catalogue comprising twenty folio\r\npages. Printed on this catalogue was the information: \"Dinner at 2\r\no'clock, dessert at 4, tea at 5, and supper at 10.\" The name of Bohn is\r\nprincipally remembered by the important _Libraries_ which he\r\ninaugurated: these were begun in 1846 and comprised editions of standard\r\nworks and translations, dealing with history, science, classics,\r\ntheology and archaeology, consisting in all of 766 volumes. One of\r\nBohn's most useful and laborious undertakings was his revision (6 vols.\r\n1864) of _The Bibliographer's Manual of English Literature_ (1834) of\r\nW.T. Lowndes. The plan includes bibliographical and critical notices,\r\nparticulars of prices, &c., and a considerable addition to the original\r\nwork. It had been one of Bohn's ambitions to found a great publishing\r\nhouse, but, finding that his sons had no taste for the trade, he sold\r\nthe _Libraries_ in 1864 to Messrs. Bell and Daldy, afterwards G. Bell &\r\nSons. Bohn was a man of wide culture and many interests. He himself made\r\nconsiderable contributions to his _Libraries_: he collected pictures,\r\nchina and ivories, and was a famous rose-grower. He died at Twickenham\r\non the 22nd of August 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOHTLINGK, OTTO VON (1815-1004) German Sanskrit scholar, was born on the\r\n30th of May (11th of June O.S.) 1815 at St Petersburg. Having studied\r\n(1833-1835) Oriental languages, particularly Arabic, Persian and\r\nSanskrit, at the university of St Petersburg, he continued his studies\r\nin Germany, first in Berlin and then (1839-1842) in Bonn. Returning to\r\nSt Petersburg in 1842, he was attached to the Royal Academy of Sciences,\r\nand was elected an ordinary member of that society in 1855. In 1860 he\r\nwas made \"Russian state councillor,\" and later \"privy councillor\" with a\r\ntitle of nobility. In 1868 he settled at Jena, and in 1885 removed to\r\nLeipzig, where he resided until his death there on the 1st of April\r\n1904. Bohtlingk was one of the most distinguished scholars of the 19th\r\ncentury, and his works are of pre-eminent value in the field of Indian\r\nand comparative philology. His first great work was an edition of\r\nPanini's _Acht Bucher grammatischer Regeln_ (Bonn, 1839-1840), which was\r\nin reality a criticism of Franz Bopp's philological methods. This book\r\nBohtlingk again took up forty-seven years later, when he republished it\r\nwith a complete translation under the title _Paninis Grammatik mit\r\nUbersetzung_ (Leipzig, 1887). The earlier edition was followed by\r\n_Vopadevas Grammatik_ (St Petersburg, 1847); _Uber die Sprache der\r\nJakuten_ (St Petersburg, 1851); _Indische Spruche_ (2nd ed. in 3 parts,\r\nSt Petersburg, 1870-1873, to which an index was published by Blau,\r\nLeipzig, 1893); a critical examination and translation of\r\n_Chhandogya-upanishad (St Petersburg, 1889) and a translation of\r\nBrihadaranyaka-upanishad_ (St Petersburg, 1889). In addition to these he\r\npublished several smaller treatises, notably one on the Sanskrit\r\naccents, _Uber den Accent im Sanskrit_ (1843). But his _magnum opus_ is\r\nhis great Sanskrit dictionary, _Sanskrit-Worterbuch_ (7 vols., St\r\nPetersburg, 1853-1875; new ed. 7 vols., St Petersburg, 1879-1889), which\r\nwith the assistance of his two friends, Rudolf Roth (1821-1895) and\r\nAlbrecht Weber (b. 1825), was completed in twenty-three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOHUN, the name of a family which plays an important part in English\r\nhistory during the 13th and 14th centuries; it was taken from a village\r\nsituated in the Cotentin between Coutances and the estuary of the Vire.\r\nThe Bohuns came into England at, or shortly after, the Norman Conquest;\r\nbut their early history there is obscure. The founder of their greatness\r\nwas Humphrey III., who in the latter years of Henry I., makes his\r\nappearance as a _dapifer_, or steward, in the royal household. He\r\nmarried the daughter of Milo of Gloucester, and played an ambiguous part\r\nin Stephen's reign, siding at first with the king and afterwards with\r\nthe empress. Humphrey III. lived until 1187, but his history is\r\nuneventful. He remained loyal to Henry II. through all changes, and\r\nfought in 1173 at Farnham against the rebels of East Anglia. Outliving\r\nhis eldest son, Humphrey IV., he was succeeded in the family estates by\r\nhis grandson Henry. Henry was connected with the royal house of Scotland\r\nthrough his mother Margaret, a sister of William the Lion; an alliance\r\nwhich no doubt assisted him to obtain the earldom of Hereford from John\r\n(1199). The lands of the family lay chiefly on the Welsh Marches, and\r\nfrom this date the Bohuns take a foremost place among the Marcher\r\nbarons. Henry de Bohun figures with the earls of Clare and Gloucester\r\namong the twenty-five barons who were elected by their fellows to\r\nenforce the terms of the Great Charter. In the subsequent civil war he\r\nfought on the side of Louis, and was captured at the battle of Lincoln\r\n(1217). He took the cross in the same year and died on his pilgrimage\r\n(June 1, 1220). Humphrey V., his son and heir, returned to the path of\r\nloyalty, and was permitted, some time before 1239, to inherit the\r\nearldom of Essex from his maternal uncle, William de Mandeville. But in\r\n1258 this Humphrey fell away, like his father, from the royal to the\r\nbaronial cause. He served as a nominee of the opposition on the\r\ncommittee of twenty-four which was appointed, in the Oxford parliament\r\nof that year, to reform the administration. It was only the alliance of\r\nMontfort with Llewelyn of North Wales that brought the earl of Hereford\r\nback to his allegiance. Humphrey V. headed the first secession of the\r\nWelsh Marchers from the party of the opposition (1263), and was amongst\r\nthe captives whom the Montfortians took at Lewes. The earl's son and\r\nnamesake was on the victorious side, and shared in the defeat of\r\nEvesham, which he did not long survive. Humphrey V. was, therefore,\r\nnaturally selected as one of the twelve arbitrators to draw up the ban\r\nof Kenilworth (1266), by which the disinherited rebels were allowed to\r\nmake their peace. Dying in 1275, he was succeeded by his grandson\r\nHumphrey VII. This Bohun lives in history as one of the recalcitrant\r\nbarons of the year 1297, who extorted from Edward I. the _Confirmatio\r\nCartarum_. The motives of the earl's defiance were not altogether\r\ndisinterested. He had suffered twice from the chicanery of Edward's\r\nlawyers; in 1284 when a dispute between himself and the royal favourite,\r\nJohn Giffard, was decided in the latter's favour; and again in 1292 when\r\nhe was punished with temporary imprisonment and sequestration for a\r\ntechnical, and apparently unwitting, contempt of the king's court. In\r\ncompany, therefore, with the earl of Norfolk he refused to render\r\nforeign service in Gascony, on the plea that they were only bound to\r\nserve with the king, who was himself bound for Flanders. Their attitude\r\nbrought to a head the general discontent which Edward had excited by his\r\narbitrary taxation; and Edward was obliged to make a surrender on all\r\nthe subjects of complaint. At Falkirk (1298) Humphrey VII. redeemed his\r\ncharacter for loyalty. His son, Humphrey VIII., who succeeded him in the\r\nsame year, was allowed to marry one of the king's daughters, Eleanor,\r\nthe widowed countess of Holland (1302). This close connexion with the\r\nroyal house did not prevent him, as it did not prevent Earl Thomas of\r\nLancaster, from joining the opposition to the feeble Edward II. In 1310\r\nHumphrey VIII. figured among the Lords Ordainers; though, with more\r\npatriotism than some of his fellow-commissioners, he afterwards followed\r\nthe king to Bannockburn. He was taken captive in the battle, but\r\nexchanged for the wife of Robert Bruce. Subsequently he returned to the\r\ncause of his order, and fell on the side of Earl Thomas at the field of\r\nBoroughbridge (1322). With him, as with his father, the politics of the\r\nMarches had been the main consideration; his final change of side was\r\ndue to jealousy of the younger Despenser, whose lordship of Glamorgan\r\nwas too great for the comfort of the Bohuns in Brecon. With the death of\r\nHumphrey VIII. the fortunes of the family enter on a more peaceful\r\nstage. Earl John (d. 1335) was inconspicuous; Humphrey IX. (d. 1361)\r\nmerely distinguished himself as a captain in the Breton campaigns of the\r\nHundred Years' War, winning the victories of Morlaix (1342) and La Roche\r\nDerrien (1347). His nephew and heir, Humphrey X., who inherited the\r\nearldom of Northampton from his father, was territorially the most\r\nimportant representative of the Bohuns. But the male line was\r\nextinguished by his death (1373). The three earldoms and the broad lands\r\nof the Bohuns were divided between two co-heiresses. Both married\r\nmembers of the royal house. The elder, Eleanor, was given in 1374 to\r\nThomas of Woodstock, seventh son of Edward III.; the younger, Mary, to\r\nHenry, earl of Derby, son of John of Gaunt and afterwards Henry IV., in\r\n1380 or 1381. From these two marriages sprang the houses of Lancaster\r\nand Stafford.\r\n\r\n  See J.E. Doyle's _Official Baronage of England_ (1886), the _Complete\r\n  Peerage_ of G. E. C(okayne), (1867-1898); T.F. Tout's \"Wales and the\r\n  March during the Barons' War,\" in Owens College Historical Essays, pp.\r\n  87-136 (1902); J.E. Morris' _Welsh Wars of King Edward I._, chs. vi.,\r\n  viii. (1901).     (H. W. C. D.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOIARDO, MATTEO MARIA, COUNT (1434-1404), Italian poet, who came of a\r\nnoble and illustrious house established at Ferrara, but originally from\r\nReggio, was born at Scandiano, one of the seignorial estates of his\r\nfamily, near Reggio di Modena, about the year 1434, according to\r\nTiraboschi, or 1420 according to Mazzuchelli. At an early age he entered\r\nthe university of Ferrara, where he acquired a good knowledge of Greek\r\nand Latin, and even of the Oriental languages, and was in due time\r\nadmitted doctor in philosophy and in law. At the court of Ferrara, where\r\nhe enjoyed the favour of Duke Borso d'Este and his successor Hercules,\r\nhe was entrusted with several honourable employments, and in particular\r\nwas named governor of Reggio, an appointment which he held in the year\r\n1478. Three years afterwards he was elected captain of Modena, and\r\nreappointed governor of the town and citadel of Reggio, where he died in\r\nthe year 1494, though in what month is uncertain.\r\n\r\nAlmost all Boiardo's works, and especially his great poem of the\r\n_Orlando Inamorato_, were composed for the amusement of Duke Hercules\r\nand his court, though not written within its precincts. His practice, it\r\nis said, was to retire to Scandiano or some other of his estates, and\r\nthere to devote himself to composition; and Castelvetro, Vallisnieri,\r\nMazzuchelli and Tiraboschi all unite in stating that he took care to\r\ninsert in the descriptions of his poem those of the agreeable environs\r\nof his chateau, and that the greater part of the names of his heroes, as\r\nMandricardo, Gradasse, Sacripant, Agramant and others, were merely the\r\nnames of some of his peasants, which, from their uncouthness, appeared\r\nto him proper to be given to Saracen warriors. Be this as it may, the\r\n_Orlando Inamorato_ deserves to be considered as one of the most\r\nimportant poems in Italian literature, since it forms the first example\r\nof the romantic epic worthy to serve as a model, and, as such,\r\nundoubtedly produced Ariosto's _Orlando Furioso_. Gravina and Mazzuchell\r\nhave said, and succeeding writers have repeated on their authority, that\r\nBoiardo proposed to himself as his model the _Iliad_ of Homer; that\r\nParis is besieged like the city of Troy; that Angelica holds the place\r\nof Helen; and that, in short, the one poem is a sort of reflex image of\r\nthe other. In point of fact, however, the subject-matter of the poem is\r\nderived from the _Fabulous Chronicle_ of the pseudo-Turpin; though, with\r\nthe exception of the names of Charlemagne, Roland, Oliver, and some\r\nother principal warriors, who necessarily figure as important characters\r\nin the various scenes, there is little resemblance between the detailed\r\nplot of the one and that of the other. The poem, which Boiardo did not\r\nlive to finish, was printed at Scandiano the year after his death, under\r\nthe superintendence of his son Count Camillo. The title of the book is\r\nwithout date; but a Latin letter from Antonia Caraffa di Reggio,\r\nprefixed to the poem, is dated the kalends of June 1495. A second\r\nedition, also without date, but which must have been printed before the\r\nyear 1500, appeared at Venice; and the poem was twice reprinted there\r\nduring the first twenty years of the 16th century. These editions are\r\nthe more curious and valuable since they contain nothing but the text of\r\nthe author, which is comprised in three books, divided into cantos, the\r\nthird book being incomplete. But Niccolo degli Agostini, an indifferent\r\npoet, had the courage to continue the work commenced by Boiardo, adding\r\nto it three books, which were printed at Venice in 1526-1531, in 4to;\r\nand since that time no edition of the _Orlando_ has been printed without\r\nthe continuation of Agostini, wretched as it unquestionably is.\r\nBoiardo's poem suffers from the incurable defect of a laboured and heavy\r\nstyle. His story is skilfully constructed, the characters are well drawn\r\nand sustained throughout; many of the incidents show a power and\r\nfertility of imagination not inferior to that of Ariosto, but the\r\nperfect workmanship indispensable for a great work of art is wanting.\r\nThe poem in its original shape was not popular, and has been completely\r\nsuperseded by the _Rifacimento_ of Francesco Berni (q.v.).\r\n\r\nThe other works of Boiardo are--(1) _Il Timone_, a comedy, Scandiano,\r\n1500, 4to; (2) _Sonnetti e Canzoni_, Reggio, 1499, 4to; (3) _Carmen\r\nBucolicon_, Reggio, 1500, 4to; (4) _Cinque Capitoli in terza rima_,\r\nVenice, 1523 or 1533; (5) _Apulejo dell' Asino d'Oro_, Venice, 1516,\r\n1518; (6) _Asino d'Oro de Luciano tradolto in volgare_, Venice, 1523,\r\n8vo; (7) _Erodoto Alicarnasseo istorico, tradotto di Greco in Lingua\r\nItaliana_, Venice, 1533 and 1538, 8vo; (8) _Rerum Italicarum\r\nScriptores_.\r\n\r\n  See Panizzi's _Boiardo_ (9 vols., 1830-1831).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOIE, HEINRICH CHRISTIAN (1744-1806), German author, was born at Meldorf\r\nin the then Danish province of Schleswig-Holstein on the 19th of July\r\n1744. After studying law at Jena, he went in 1769 to Gottingen, where he\r\nbecame one of the leading spirits in the Gottingen \"Dichterbund\" or\r\n\"Hain.\" Boie's poetical talent was not great, but his thorough knowledge\r\nof literature, his excellent taste and sound judgment, made him an ideal\r\nperson to awake the poetical genius of others. Together with F.W. Gotter\r\n(q.v.) he founded in 1770 the Gottingen _Musenalmanach_, which he\r\ndirected and edited until 1775, when, in conjunction with C.W. von Dohm\r\n(1751-1820), he brought out _Das deutsche Museum_, which became one of\r\nthe best literary periodicals of the day. In 1776 Boie became secretary\r\nto the commander-in-chief at Hanover, and in 1781 was appointed\r\nadministrator of the province of Suderditmarschen in Holstein. He died\r\nat Meldorf on the 3rd of March 1806.\r\n\r\n  See K. Weinhold, _Heinrich Christian Boie_ (Halle, 1868).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOIELDIEU, FRANCOIS ADRIEN (1775-1834), French composer of comic opera,\r\nwas born at Rouen on the 15th of December 1775. He received his first\r\nmusical education from M. Broche, the cathedral organist, who appears to\r\nhave treated him very harshly. He began composing songs and chamber\r\nmusic at a very early age-his first opera, _La Fille coupable_ (the\r\nlibretto by his father), and his second opera, _Rosalie et Myrza_, being\r\nproduced on the stage of Rouen in 1795. Not satisfied with his local\r\nsuccess he went to Paris in 1795. His scores were submitted to\r\nCherubini, Mehul and others, but met with little approbation. Grand\r\nopera was the order of the day. Boieldieu had to fall back on his talent\r\nas a pianoforte-player for a livelihood. Success came at last from an\r\nunexpected source. P.J. Garat, a fashionable singer of the period,\r\nadmired Boieldleu's touch on the piano, and made him his accompanist. In\r\nthe drawing-rooms of the Directoire Garat sang the charming songs and\r\nballads with which the young composer supplied him. Thus Boieldieu's\r\nreputation gradually extended to wider circles. In 1796 _Les Deux\r\nlettres_ was produced, and in 1797 _La Famille suisse_ appeared for the\r\nfirst time on a Paris stage, and was well received. Several other operas\r\nfollowed in rapid succession, of which only _Le Calife de Bagdad_ (1800)\r\nhas escaped oblivion. After the enormous success of this work, Boieldieu\r\nfelt the want of a thorough musical training and took lessons from\r\nCherubini, the influence of that great master being clearly discernible\r\nin the higher artistic finish of his pupil's later compositions. In 1802\r\nBoieldieu, to escape the domestic troubles caused by his marriage with\r\nClotilde Aug. Mafleuroy, a celebrated ballet-dancer of the Paris opera,\r\ntook flight and went to Russia, where he was received with open arms by\r\nthe emperor Alexander. During his prolonged stay at St Petersburg he\r\ncomposed a number of operas. He also set to music the choruses of\r\nRacine's _Athalie_, one of his few attempts at the tragic style of\r\ndramatic writing. In 1811 he returned to his own country, where the\r\nfollowing year witnessed the production of one of his finest works,\r\n_Jean de Paris_, in which he depicted with much felicity the charming\r\ncoquetry of the queen of Navarre, the chivalrous _verve_ of the king,\r\nthe officious pedantry of the seneschal, and the amorous tenderness of\r\nthe page. He succeeded Mehul as professor of composition at the\r\nConservatoire in 1817. _Le Chapeau rouge_ was produced with great\r\nsuccess in 1818. Boieldieu's second and greatest masterpiece was his\r\n_Dame blanche_ (1825). The libretto, written by Scribe, was partly\r\nsuggested by Walter Scott's _Monastery_, and several original Scottish\r\ntunes cleverly introduced by the composer add to the melodious charm and\r\nlocal colour of the work. On the death of his wife in 1825, Boieldieu\r\nmarried a singer. His own death was due to a violent attack of pulmonary\r\ndisease. He vainly tried to escape the rapid progress of the illness by\r\ntravel in Italy and the south of France, but returned to Paris only to\r\ndie on the 8th of October 1834.\r\n\r\n  Lives of Boieldieu have been written by Pougin (Paris, 1875), J.A.\r\n  Refeuvaille (Rouen, 1836), Hequet (Paris, 1864), Emile Duval (Geneva,\r\n  1883). See also Adolphe Charles Adam, _Derniers souvenirs d'un\r\n  musicien_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOIGNE, BENOIT DE, COUNT (1751-1830), the first of the French military\r\nadventurers in India, was born at Chambery in Savoy on the 8th of March\r\n1751, being the son of a fur merchant. He joined the Irish Brigade in\r\nFrance in 1768, and subsequently he entered the Russian service and was\r\ncaptured by the Turks. Hearing of the wealth of India, he made his way\r\nto that country, and after serving for a short time in the East India\r\nCompany, he resigned and joined Mahadji Sindhia in 1784 for the purpose\r\nof training his troops in the European methods of war. In the battles of\r\nLalsot and Chaksana Boigne and his two battalions proved their worth by\r\nholding the field when the rest of the Mahratta army was defeated by the\r\nRajputs. In the battle of Agra (1788) he restored the Mahratta fortunes,\r\nand made Mahadji Sindhia undisputed master of Hindostan. This success\r\nled to his being given the command of a brigade of ten battalions of\r\ninfantry, with which he won the victories of Patan and Merta in 1790. In\r\nconsequence Boigne was allowed to raise two further brigades of\r\ndisciplined infantry, and made commander-in-chief of Sindhia's army. In\r\nthe battle of Lakhairi (1793) he defeated Holkar's army. On the death of\r\nMahadji Sindhia in 1794, Boigne could have made himself master of\r\nHindostan had he wished it, but he remained loyal to Daulat Rao Sindhia.\r\nIn 1795 his health began to fail, and he resigned his command, and in\r\nthe following year returned to Europe with a fortune of L400,000. He\r\nlived in retirement during the lifetime of Napoleon, but was greatly\r\nhonoured by Louis XVIII. He died on the 21st of June 1830.\r\n\r\n  See H. Compton, _European Military Adventurers of Hindustan_ (1892).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOII (perhaps = \"the terrible\"), a Celtic people, whose original home\r\nwas Gallia Transalpina. They were known to the Romans, at least by name,\r\nin the time of Plautus, as is shown by the contemptuous reference in the\r\n_Captivi_ (888). At an early date they split up into two main groups,\r\none of which made its way into Italy, the other into Germany. Some,\r\nhowever, appear to have stayed behind, since, during the Second Punic\r\nWar, Magalus, a Boian prince, offered to show Hannibal the way into\r\nItaly after he had crossed the Pyrenees (Livy xxi. 29). The first group\r\nof immigrants is said to have crossed the Pennine Alps (Great St\r\nBernard) into the valley of the Po. Finding the district already\r\noccupied, they proceeded over the river, drove out the Etruscans and\r\nUmbrians, and established themselves as far as the Apennines in the\r\nmodern Romagna. According to Cato (in Pliny, _Nat. Hist._ iii. 116) they\r\ncomprised as many as 112 different tribes, and from the remains\r\ndiscovered in the tombs at Hallstatt, La Tene and other places, they\r\nappear to have been fairly civilized. Several wars took place between\r\nthem and the Romans. In 283 they were defeated, together with the\r\nEtruscans, at the Vadimonian lake; in 224, after the battle of Telamon\r\nin Etruria, they were forced to submit. But they still cherished a\r\nhatred of the Romans, and during the Second Punic War (218), irritated\r\nby the foundation of the Roman colonies of Cremona and Placentia, they\r\nrendered valuable assistance to Hannibal. They continued the struggle\r\nagainst Rome from 201 to 191, when they were finally subdued by P.\r\nCornelius Scipio Nasica, and deprived of nearly half their territory.\r\nAccording to Strabo (v. p. 213) the Boii were driven back across the\r\nAlps and settled on the land of their kinsmen, the Taurisci, on the\r\nDanube, adjoining Vindelicia and Raetia. Most authorities, however,\r\nassume that there had been a settlement of the Boii on the Danube from\r\nvery early times, in part of the modern Bohemia (anc. _Boiohemum_, \"land\r\nof the Boii\"). About 60 B.C. some of the Boii migrated to Noricum and\r\nPannonia, when 32,000 of them joined the expedition of the Helvetians\r\ninto Gaul, and shared their defeat near Bibracte (58). They were\r\nsubsequently allowed by Caesar to settle in the territory of the Aedui\r\nbetween the Loire and the Allier. Their chief town was Gorgobina (site\r\nuncertain). Those who remained on the Danube were exterminated by the\r\nDacian king, Boerebista, and the district they had occupied was\r\nafterwards called the \"desert of the Boii\" (Strabo vii. p. 292). In A.D.\r\n69 a Boian named Mariccus stirred up a fanatical revolt, but was soon\r\ndefeated and put to death. Some remnants of the Boii are mentioned as\r\ndwelling near Bordeaux; but Mommsen inclines to the opinion that the\r\nthree groups (in Bordeaux, Bohemia and the Po districts) were not really\r\nscattered branches of one and the same stock, but that they are\r\ninstances of a mere similarity of name.\r\n\r\nThe Boii, as we know them, belonged almost certainly to the Early Iron\r\nage. They probably used long iron swords for dealing cutting blows, and\r\nfrom the size of the handles they must have been a race of large men\r\n(cf. Polybius ii. 30). For their ethnological affinities and especially\r\ntheir possible connexion with the Homeric Achaeans see W. Ridgeway's\r\n_Early Age of Greece_ (vol. i., 1901).\r\n\r\n  See L.

Treatment proceeds on the lines of\r\nbringing the mischief out, assisting the evacuation of the boil by the\r\nlancet, and clearing the system. In the English Bible, and also in\r\npopular medical terminology, \"boil\" is used of various forms of ulcerous\r\naffection. The boils which were one of the plagues in Egypt were\r\napparently the bubonic plague. The terms Aleppo boil (or button), Delhi\r\nboil, Oriental boil, Biskra button, &c., have been given to a tropical\r\nepidemic, characterized by ulcers on the face, due to a diplococcus\r\nparasite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILEAU-DESPREAUX, NICOLAS (1636-1711), French poet and critic, was born\r\non the 1st of November 1636 in the rue de Jerusalem, Paris. The same\r\nDespreaux was derived from a small property at Crosne near Villeneuve\r\nSaint-Georges. He was the fifteenth child of Gilles Boileau, a clerk in\r\nthe parlement. Two of his brothers attained some distinction: Gilles\r\nBoileau (1631-1669), the author of a translation of Epictetus; and\r\nJacques Boileau, who became a canon of the Sainte-Chapelle, and made\r\nvaluable contributions to church history. His mother died when he was\r\ntwo years old; and Nicolas Boileau, who had a delicate constitution,\r\nseems to have suffered something from want of care. Sainte-Beuve puts\r\ndown his somewhat hard and unsympathetic outlook quite as much to the\r\nuninspiring circumstances of these days as to the general character of\r\nhis time. He cannot be said to have been early disenchanted, for he\r\nnever seems to have had any illusions; he grew up with a single passion,\r\n\"the hatred of stupid books.\" He was educated at the College de\r\nBeauvais, and was then sent to study theology at the Sorbonne. He\r\nexchanged theology for law, however, and was called to the bar on the\r\n4th of December 1656. From the profession of law, after a short trial,\r\nhe recoiled in disgust, complaining bitterly of the amount of chicanery\r\nwhich passed under the name of law and justice. His father died in 1657,\r\nleaving him a small fortune, and thenceforward he devoted himself to\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nSuch of his early poems as have been preserved hardly contain the\r\npromise of what he ultimately became. The first piece in which his\r\npeculiar powers were displayed was the first satire (1660), in imitation\r\nof the third satire of Juvenal; it embodied the farewell of a poet to\r\nthe city of Paris. This was quickly followed by eight others, and the\r\nnumber was at a later period increased to twelve. A twofold interest\r\nattaches to the satires. In the first place the author skilfully\r\nparodies and attacks writers who at the time were placed in the very\r\nfirst rank, such as Jean Chapelain, the abbe Charles Cotin, Philippe\r\nQuinault and Georges de Scudery; he openly raised the standard of revolt\r\nagainst the older poets. But in the second place he showed both by\r\nprecept and practice what were the poetical capabilities of the French\r\nlanguage. Prose in the hands of such writers as Descartes and Pascal had\r\nproved itself a flexible and powerful instrument of expression, with a\r\ndistinct mechanism and form. But except with Malherbe, there had been no\r\nattempt to fashion French versification according to rule or method. In\r\nBoileau for the first time appeared terseness and vigour of expression,\r\nwith perfect regularity of verse structure. His admiration for Moliere\r\nfound expression in the stanzas addressed to him (1663), and in the\r\nsecond satire (1664). In 1664 he composed his prose _Dialogue des heros\r\nde roman_, a satire on the elaborate romances of the time, which may be\r\nsaid to have once for all abolished the lucubrations of La Calprenede,\r\nMlle de Scudery and their fellows. Though fairly widely read in\r\nmanuscript, the book was not published till 1713, out of regard, it is\r\nsaid, for Mlle de Scudery. To these early days belong the reunions at\r\nthe _Moulon Blanc_ and the _Pomme du Pin_, where Boileau, Moliere,\r\nRacine, Chapelle and Antoine Furetiere met to discuss literary\r\nquestions. To Moliere and Racine he proved a constant friend, and\r\nsupported their interests on many occasions.\r\n\r\nIn 1666, prompted by the publication of two unauthorized editions, he\r\npublished _Satires du Sieur D...._, containing seven satires and the\r\n_Discours au roi_. From 1669 onwards appeared his epistles, graver in\r\ntone than the satires, maturer in thought, more exquisite and polished\r\nin style. The _Epitres_ gained for him the favour of Louis XIV., who\r\ndesired his presence at court. The king asked him which he thought his\r\nbest verses. Whereupon Boileau diplomatically selected as his \"least\r\nbad\" some still unprinted lines in honour of the grand monarch and\r\nproceeded to recite them. He received forthwith a pension of 2000\r\nlivres. In 1674 his two masterpieces, _L'Art poetique_ and _Le Lutrin_,\r\nwere published with some earlier works as the _Oeuvres diverses du sieur\r\nD_.... The first, in imitation of the _Ars Poetica_ of Horace, lays down\r\nthe code for all future French verse, and may be said to fill in French\r\nliterature a parallel place to that held by its prototype in Latin. On\r\nEnglish literature the maxims of Boileau, through the translation\r\nrevised by Dryden, and through the magnificent imitation of them in\r\nPope's _Essay on Criticism_, have exercised no slight influence. Boileau\r\ndoes not merely lay down rules for the language of poetry, but analyses\r\ncarefully the various kinds of verse composition, and enunciates the\r\nprinciples peculiar to each. Of the four books of _L'Art poetique_, the\r\nfirst and last consist of general precepts, inculcating mainly the great\r\nrule of _bon sens_; the second treats of the pastoral, the elegy, the\r\node, the epigram and satire; and the third of tragic and epic poetry.\r\nThough the rules laid down are of value, their tendency is rather to\r\nhamper and render too mechanical the efforts of poetry. Boileau himself,\r\na great, though by no means infallible critic in verse, cannot be\r\nconsidered a great poet. He rendered the utmost service in destroying\r\nthe exaggerated reputations of the mediocrities of his time, but his\r\njudgment was sometimes at fault. The _Lutrin_, a mock heroic poem, of\r\nwhich four cantos appeared in 1674, furnished Alexander Pope with a\r\nmodel for the _Rape of the Lock_, but the English poem is superior in\r\nrichness of imagination and subtlety of invention. The fifth and sixth\r\ncantos, afterwards added by Boileau, rather detract from the beauty of\r\nthe poem; the last canto in particular is quite unworthy of his genius.\r\nIn 1674 appeared also his translation of Longinus _On the Sublime_, to\r\nwhich were added in 1693 certain critical reflections, chiefly directed\r\nagainst the theory of the superiority of the moderns over the ancients\r\nas advanced by Charles Perrault.\r\n\r\nBoileau was made historiographer to the king in 1677. From this time the\r\namount of his production diminished. To this period of his life belong\r\nthe satire, _Sur les femmes_, the ode, _Sur la prise de Namur_, the\r\nepistles, _A mes vers_ and _Sur l'amour de Dieu_, and the satire _Sur\r\nl'homme_. The satires had raised up a crowd of enemies against Boileau.\r\nThe 10th satire, on women, provoked an _Apologie des femmes_ from\r\nCharles Perrault. Antoine Arnauld in the year of his death wrote a\r\nletter in defence of Boileau, but when at the desire of his friends he\r\nsubmitted his reply to Bossuet, the bishop pronounced all satire to be\r\nincompatible with the spirit of Christianity, and the 10th satire to be\r\nsubversive of morality. The friends of Arnauld had declared that it was\r\ninconsistent with the dignity of a churchman to write on any subject so\r\ntrivial as poetry. The epistle, _Sur l'amour de Dieu_, was a triumphant\r\nvindication on the part of Boileau of the dignity of his art. It was not\r\nuntil the 15th of April 1684 that he was admitted to the Academy, and\r\nthen only by the king's wish. In 1687 he retired to a country-house he\r\nhad bought at Auteuil, which Racine, because of the numerous guests,\r\ncalls his _hotellerie d'Auteuil_. In 1705 he sold his house and returned\r\nto Paris, where he lived with his confessor in the cloisters of Notre\r\nDame. In the 12th satire, _Sur l'equivoque_, he attacked the Jesuits in\r\nverses which Sainte-Beuve called a recapitulation of the _Lettres\r\nprovinciales_ of Pascal. This was written about 1705. He then gave his\r\nattention to the arrangement of a complete and definitive edition of his\r\nworks. But the Jesuit fathers obtained from Louis XIV. the withdrawal of\r\nthe privilege already granted for the publication, and demanded the\r\nsuppression of the 12th satire. These annoyances are said to have\r\nhastened his death, which took place on the 13th of March 1711.\r\n\r\nBoileau was a man of warm and kindly feelings, honest, outspoken and\r\nbenevolent. Many anecdotes are told of his frankness of speech at court,\r\nand of his generous actions. He holds a well-defined place in French\r\nliterature, as the first who reduced its versification to rule, and\r\ntaught the value of workmanship for its own sake. His influence on\r\nEnglish literature, through Pope and his contemporaries, was not less\r\nstrong, though less durable. After much undue depreciation Boileau's\r\ncritical work has been rehabilitated by recent writers, perhaps to the\r\nextent of some exaggeration in the other direction. It has been shown\r\nthat in spite of undue harshness in individual cases most of his\r\ncriticisms have been substantially adopted by his successors.\r\n\r\n  Numerous editions of Boileau's works were published during his\r\n  lifetime. The last of these, _Oeuvres diverses_ (1701), known as the\r\n  \"favourite\" edition of the poet, was reprinted with variants and notes\r\n  by Alphonse Pauly (2 vols., 1894). The critical text of his works was\r\n  established by Berriat Saint-Prix, _Oeuvres de Boileau_ (4 vols.,\r\n  1830-1837), who made use of some 350 editions. This text, edited with\r\n  notes by Paul Cheron, with the _Boloeana_ of 1740, and an essay by\r\n  Sainte-Beuve, was reprinted by Garnier _freres_ (1860).\r\n\r\n  See also Sainte-Beuve, _Causeries du lundi_, vol. vi.; F. Brunetiere,\r\n  \"L'Esthetique de Boileau\" (_Revue des Deux Mondes_, June 1889), and an\r\n  exhaustive article by the same critic in _La Grande encyclopedie_; G.\r\n  Lanson, _Boileau_ (1892), in the series of _Grands ecrivains\r\n  francais_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILER, a vessel in which water or other liquid is heated to the boiling\r\npoint; specifically, the apparatus by which steam is produced from\r\nwater, as one step in the process whereby the potential energy of coal\r\nor other fuel is converted into mechanical work by means of the\r\nsteam-engine. Boilers of the latter kind must all possess certain\r\nessential features, whilst of other qualities that are desirable some\r\nmay not be altogether compatible with the special conditions under which\r\nthe boilers are to be worked. Amongst the essentials are a receptacle\r\ncapable of containing the water and the steam produced by its\r\nevaporation, and strong enough continuously to withstand with safety the\r\nhighest pressure of steam for which the boiler is intended. Another\r\nessential is a furnace for burning the fuel, and a further one is the\r\nprovision of a sufficiency of heating surface for the transmission of\r\nthe heat produced by the combustion of the fuel to the water which is\r\nrequired to be evaporated. Desirable qualities are that the arrangements\r\nof the furnaces should be such that a reasonably perfect combustion of\r\nthe fuel should be possible, and that the heating surfaces should be\r\ncapable of transmitting a large proportion of the heat produced to the\r\nwater so as to obtain a high evaporative efficiency. Further, the design\r\ngenerally should be compact, not too heavy or costly, and such that the\r\ncleaning necessary to maintain the evaporative efficiency can be easily\r\neffected. It should also be such that the cost of upkeep will be small,\r\nand that only an average amount of skill and attention will be required\r\nunder working conditions. It is for providing these qualities in\r\ndifferent degrees according to the special requirements of various\r\ncircumstances that the very different designs of the various types of\r\nboilers have been evolved.\r\n\r\n_Classes of Boilers._--Boilers generally may be divided into two\r\ndistinct classes, one comprising those which are generally called \"tank\"\r\nboilers, containing relatively large quantities of water, and the other\r\nthose which are generally called \"water-tube\" boilers, in which the\r\nwater is mainly contained in numerous comparatively small tubes. There\r\nare, however, some types of boiler which combine to some extent the\r\nproperties of both these classes. Each class has its representatives\r\namongst both land and marine boilers. In \"tank\" boilers the outer shell\r\nis wholly or partially cylindrical, this form being one in which the\r\nnecessary strength can be obtained without the use of a large number of\r\nstays. The boilers are generally internally fired, the furnace plates\r\nbeing surrounded with water and forming the most efficient portion of\r\nthe heating surfaces. On leaving the furnace the products of combustion\r\nare led into a chamber and thence through flues or through numerous\r\nsmall tubes which serve to transmit some of the heat of combustion to\r\nthe water contained in the boiler. In \"water-tube\" boilers the fire is\r\nusually placed under a collection of tubes containing water and forming\r\nthe major portion of the heating surface of the boiler. Both the fire\r\nand the tubes are enclosed in an outer casing of brickwork or other\r\nfire-resisting substance. In some forms of water-tube boiler the fire\r\nis entirely surrounded by water-tubes and the casing is in no part\r\nexposed to the direct action of the fire. In \"tank\" boilers generally no\r\ndifficulty is experienced in keeping all the heating surfaces in close\r\ncontact with water, but in \"water-tube\" boilers special provision has to\r\nbe made in the design for maintaining the circulation of water through\r\nthe tubes. (For \"flash\" boilers see MOTOR VEHICLES, and for domestic\r\nhot-water boilers HEATING.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Lancashire.\r\n\r\n  _Tank Boilers._--Of large stationary boilers the forms most commonly\r\n  used are those known as the \"Lancashire\" boiler, and its modification\r\n  the \"Galloway\" boiler. These boilers are made from 26 to 30 ft. long,\r\n  with diameters from 6-1/2 to 8 ft., and have two cylindrical furnace\r\n  flues which in the \"Lancashire\" boiler extend for its whole length\r\n  (see fig. 3). The working pressure is about 60 lb. per sq. in. in the\r\n  older boilers, from 100 lb. to 120 lb. per sq. in. in those supplying\r\n  steam to compound engines, and from 150 to 170 lb. where triple\r\n  expansion engines are used. In some cases they have been constructed\r\n  for a pressure of 200 lb. per sq. in. The furnace flues are usually\r\n  made in sections from 3 to 3-1/2 ft. long. Each section consists of\r\n  one plate bent into a cylindrical form, the longitudinal joint being\r\n  welded, and is flanged at both ends, the various pieces being joined\r\n  together by an \"Adamson\" joint (fig. 1.). It will be seen that these\r\n  joints do not expose either rivets or double thickness of plate to the\r\n  action of the fire; they further serve as stiffening rings to prevent\r\n  collapse of the flue. In most of these boilers the heating surface is\r\n  increased by fitting in the furnace flues a number of \"Galloway\"\r\n  tubes. These are conical tubes, made with a flange at each end, by\r\n  means of which they are connected to the furnace plate. They are so\r\n  proportioned that the diameter of the large end of the tube is\r\n  slightly greater than that of the flange of the small end; this\r\n  enables them to be readily removed and replaced if necessary. These\r\n  tubes not only add to the heating surface, but they stiffen the flue,\r\n  promote circulation of the water in the boiler, and by mixing up the\r\n  flue gases improve the evaporative efficiency.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Adamson Joint.]\r\n\r\n  In the \"Galloway\" boiler the two furnaces extend only for about 9 or\r\n  10 ft. into the boiler, and lead into a large chamber or flue in which\r\n  a number of \"Galloway\" tubes are fitted, and which extends from the\r\n  furnace end to the end of the boiler. A cross section of this flue\r\n  showing the distribution of the Galloway tubes is shown in fig. 2.\r\n  When boilers less than about 6-1/2 ft. in diameter are needed, a\r\n  somewhat similar type to the Lancashire boiler is used containing only\r\n  one furnace. This is called a \"Cornish\" boiler.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Galloway Boiler: Section beyond the Bridge.]\r\n\r\n  In all three types of boiler the brickwork is constructed to form one\r\n  central flue passing along the bottom of the boiler and two side flues\r\n  extending up the side nearly to the water-level. A cross section of\r\n  the brickwork is shown in fig. 2. The usual arrangement is for the\r\n  flue gases to be divided as they leave the internal flue; one-half\r\n  returns along each side flue to the front of the boiler, and the whole\r\n  then passes downwards into the central flue, travelling under the\r\n  bottom of the boiler until the gases again reach the back end, where\r\n  they pass into the chimney. In a few cases the arrangement is\r\n  reversed, the gases first passing along the bottom flue and returning\r\n  along the side flues. This latter arrangement, whilst promoting a more\r\n  rapid circulation of water, has the disadvantage of requiring two\r\n  dampers, and it is not suitable for those cases in which heavy\r\n  deposits form on the bottoms of the boilers.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Vertical.\r\n\r\n  Where floor space is limited and also for small installations, other\r\n  forms of cylindrical boilers are used, most of them being of the\r\n  vertical type. That most commonly used is the simple vertical boiler,\r\n  with a plain vertical fire-box, and an internal smoke stack traversing\r\n  the steam space. The fire-box is made slightly tapering in diameter,\r\n  the space between it and the shell being filled with water. In all but\r\n  the small sizes cross tubes are generally fitted. These are made about\r\n  9 in. in diameter of 3/8-in. plate flanged at each end to enable them\r\n  to be riveted to the fire-box plates. They are usually fitted with a\r\n  slight inclination to facilitate water circulation. and a hand-hole\r\n  closed by a suitable door is provided in the outer shell opposite to\r\n  each tube for cleaning purposes. A boiler of this kind is illustrated\r\n  in fig. 4. This form is often used on board ship for auxiliary\r\n  purposes. Where more heating surface is required than can be obtained\r\n  in the cross-tube boiler other types of vertical boiler are employed.\r\n  For instance, in the \"Tyne\" boiler (fig. 5) the furnace is\r\n  hemispherical, and the products of combustion are led into an upper\r\n  combustion chamber traversed by four or more inclined water-tubes of\r\n  about 9 in. diameter and by several vertical water-tubes of less\r\n  diameter. In the \"Victoria\" boiler made by Messrs Clarke, Chapman &\r\n  Co., and illustrated in fig. 6, the furnace is hemispherical; the\r\n  furnace gases are led to an internal combustion chamber, and thence\r\n  through numerous horizontal smoke-tubes to a smoke-box placed on the\r\n  side of the boiler. In the somewhat similar boiler known as the\r\n  \"Cochran,\" the combustion chamber is made with a \"dry\" back. Instead\r\n  of a water space at the back of the chamber, doors lined with\r\n  firebrick are fitted. These give easy access to the tube ends.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Lancashire Boiler.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Simple Vertical Boiler (Messrs Tinker, Ltd.).]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Marine.\r\n\r\n  The cylindrical multitubular return tube boiler is in almost universal\r\n  use in merchant steamers. It is made in various sizes ranging up to 17\r\n  ft. in diameter, the usual working pressure being from 160 to 200 lb\r\n  per sq. in., although in some few cases pressures of 265 lb. per sq.\r\n  in. are in use. These boilers are of two types, double- and\r\n  single-ended. In single-ended boilers, which are those most generally\r\n  used, the furnaces are fitted at one end only and vary in number from\r\n  one in the smallest boiler to four in the largest. Three furnaces are\r\n  the most usual practice. Each furnace generally has its own separate\r\n  combustion chamber. In four furnace boilers, however, one chamber is\r\n  sometimes made common to the two middle furnaces, and sometimes one\r\n  chamber is fitted to each pair of side furnaces. In double-ended\r\n  boilers furnaces are fitted at each end. In some cases each furnace\r\n  has a separate combustion chamber, but more usually one chamber is\r\n  made to serve for two furnaces, one at each end of the boiler. The two\r\n  types of boilers are shown in figs. 7 and 8, which illustrate boilers\r\n  made by Messrs D. Rowan & Co. of Glasgow, and which may be taken as\r\n  representing good modern practice. The furnaces used in the smaller\r\n  sizes are often of the plain cylindrical type, the thickness of plate\r\n  varying from 3/8 in. up to 3/4 in. according to the diameter of the\r\n  furnace and the working pressure. Occasionally furnaces with \"Adamson\"\r\n  joints similar to those used in Lancashire boilers are employed, but\r\n  for large furnaces and for high pressures corrugated or ribbed\r\n  furnaces are usually adopted. Sketches of the sections of these are\r\n  shown in fig. 9. The sections of the Morison, Fox and Deighton types\r\n  are made from plates originally rolled of a uniform thickness, made\r\n  into a cylindrical form with a welded longitudinal joint and then\r\n  corrugated, the only difference between them being in the shapes of\r\n  the corrugations. In the other three types the plates from which the\r\n  furnaces are made are rolled with ribs or thickened portions at\r\n  distances of 9 in. These furnaces are stronger to resist collapse than\r\n  plain furnaces of the same thickness, and accommodate themselves more\r\n  readily to changes of temperature.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Vertical Boiler with Water-tubes (the \"Tyne,\"\r\n  by Messrs Clarke, Chapman & Co.).]\r\n\r\n  There are two distinct types of connexion between the furnaces and the\r\n  combustion chambers. In one, shown in fig. 8, the furnace is flanged\r\n  at the crown portion for riveting to the tube plate, and the lower\r\n  part of the furnace is riveted to the \"wrapper\" or side plate of the\r\n  combustion chamber. In the other type, shown in fig. 7, and known\r\n  generally as the \"Gourlay back end,\" the end of the furnace is\r\n  contracted into an oval conical form, and is then flanged outwards\r\n  round the whole of its circumference. The tube plate is made to extend\r\n  to the bottom of the combustion chamber, and the furnace is riveted to\r\n  the tube plate. The advantage of the Gourlay back end is that in case\r\n  of accident to the furnace it can be removed from the boiler and be\r\n  replaced by one of the same design without disturbing the end plates,\r\n  which is not possible with the other design. The Gourlay back end,\r\n  however, is not so stiff as the other, and more longitudinal stays are\r\n  required in the boiler.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Vertical Boiler with internal combustion\r\n  chamber (the \"Victoria,\" by Messrs Clarke, Chapman & Co.).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Single-ended Marine Boiler.]\r\n\r\n  The flat sides and backs of the combustion chambers are stayed either\r\n  to one another or to the shell of the boiler by numerous screw stays\r\n  which are screwed through the two plates they connect, and which are\r\n  nearly always fitted with nuts inside the combustion chambers. The\r\n  tops of the chambers are usually stayed by strong girders resting upon\r\n  the tube plates and chamber back plates. In a few cases, however, they\r\n  are stayed by vertical stays attached to T bars riveted to the boiler\r\n  shell. A few boilers are made in which the chamber tops are\r\n  strengthened by heavy transverse girder plates. The end plates of the\r\n  boiler in the steam space and below the combustion chambers are stayed\r\n  by longitudinal stays passing through the whole length of the boiler\r\n  and secured by double nuts at each end. The tube plates are\r\n  strengthened by stay tubes screwed into them.\r\n\r\n  Where natural or chimney draught is used the tubes are generally made\r\n  3 or 3-1/4 in. outside diameter and are rarely more than 7 ft. long,\r\n  but where \"forced\" draught is employed they are usually made 2-1/2 in.\r\n  diameter and 8 to 8-1/2 ft. long. A clear space of 1-1/4 in. between\r\n  the tubes is almost always arranged for, irrespective of size of\r\n  tubes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Double-ended Marine Boiler.]\r\n\r\n  Stay tubes are screwed at both ends, the threads of the two ends being\r\n  continuous so that they can be screwed into both tube plates;\r\n  occasionally nuts are fitted to the front ends. The stay tubes are\r\n  expanded into the plates and then beaded over.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Locomotive.\r\n\r\n  The locomotive boiler consists of a cylindrical barrel attached to a\r\n  portion containing the fire-box, which is nearly rectangular both in\r\n  horizontal and vertical section. The fire-box sides are stayed to the\r\n  fire-box shell by numerous stays about 1 in. in diameter, usually\r\n  pitched 4 in. apart both vertically and horizontally. The top of the\r\n  fire-box in small boilers is stayed by means of girder stays running\r\n  longitudinally and supported at the ends upon the tube plate and the\r\n  opposite fire-box plate. In some boilers the girders are partly\r\n  supported by slings from the crown of the boiler. In larger boilers\r\n  the crown of the boiler above the fire-box is made flat and the\r\n  fire-box crown is supported by vertical stays connecting it with the\r\n  shell crown. Provision is generally made for the expansion of the tube\r\n  plate, which is of copper, by allowing the two or three cross rows of\r\n  stays nearest the tube plate to have freedom of motion upwards but not\r\n  downwards. The ordinary tubes are usually 1-3/4 in. diameter. The\r\n  fire-bars are generally, though not always, made to slope downwards\r\n  away from the fire door, and just below the lowest tubes a fire-bridge\r\n  or baffle is fitted, extending about half-way from the tube plate to\r\n  the fire-door side of the fire-box. In some cases water-tubes are\r\n  fitted, extending right across the fire-box. In a boiler for the\r\n  London & South-Western Railway Co., having a grate area of 31.5 sq.\r\n  ft. and a total heating surface of 2727 sq. ft., there are 112\r\n  water-tubes each 2-3/4 in. diameter. These are arranged in two\r\n  clusters, each containing 56, one set being placed above the\r\n  fire-bridge, and the other set nearer the fire-door end of the boiler.\r\n  The water-tubes are of seamless steel, and are expanded into the\r\n  fire-box side plates. In way of these tubes the outer shell side\r\n  plates are supported by stay bars passing right through the\r\n  water-tubes. The usual pressure of locomotive boilers is about 175\r\n  lb. to 200 lb. per sq. in.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\n  A good example of an express locomotive boiler is shown in fig. 10. In\r\n  this case the grate area is 30.9 sq. ft. and the heating surface 2500\r\n  sq. ft. The barrel is 5 ft. 6 in. diameter, 16 ft. long between tube\r\n  plates. The fire-box crown is stayed by vertical stays extending to\r\n  the shell crown, except for the three rows of stays nearest the tube\r\n  plates. These are supported by cross girders resting upon brackets\r\n  secured to the outer shell.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 10.--Express Locomotive Boiler, with widened\r\n  fire-box (Great Northern Railway, England).]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Babcock and Wilcox stationary.\r\n\r\n  _Water-Tube Boilers._--The \"Babcock & Wilcox\" boiler, as fitted for\r\n  land purposes, and illustrated in fig. 11, consists of a horizontal\r\n  cylinder forming a steam chest, having dished ends and two specially\r\n  constructed cross-boxes riveted to the bottom. Under the cylinder is\r\n  placed a sloping nest of tubes, under the upper end of which is the\r\n  fire. The sides and back of the boiler are enclosed in brickwork up to\r\n  the height of the centre of the horizontal cylinder and the front is\r\n  fitted with an iron casing lined with brick at the lower part.\r\n  Suitable brickwork baffles are arranged between the tubes themselves,\r\n  and between the nests of tubes and the cylinder, to ensure a proper\r\n  circulation of the products of combustion, which are made to pass\r\n  between the tubes three times. The nest of tubes consists of several\r\n  separate elements, each formed by a front and back header made of\r\n  wrought steel of sinuous form connected by a number of tubes. The\r\n  upper ends of the front headers are connected by short tubes to the\r\n  front cross-box of the horizontal cylinder, the lower ends being\r\n  closed. The upper ends of the back headers are connected by longer\r\n  pipes to the back cross-box, and their lower ends by short pipes to a\r\n  horizontal mud drum to which a blow-off cock and pipe are attached.\r\n  The headers are furnished with holes on two opposite sides; those on\r\n  one side form the means of connexion between the headers and tubes,\r\n  and the others allow access for fixing the tubes in position and\r\n  cleaning. The outer holes are oval, and closed by special fittings\r\n  shown in fig. 18, the watertightness of the joints being secured by\r\n  the outer cover plates. The holes being oval, the inside fitting can\r\n  be placed in position from outside, and it is so made as to cover the\r\n  opening and prevent any great outrush of steam or water should the\r\n  bolt break. Any desired working pressure can be provided for in these\r\n  boilers; in some special cases it rises as high as 500 lb. per sq.\r\n  in., but a more usual pressure is 180 lb. Like all water-tube\r\n  boilers, they require to be frequently cleaned if impure feed-water is\r\n  used, but the straightness of their tubes enables their condition to\r\n  be ascertained at any time when the boiler is out of use, and any\r\n  accumulation of scale to be removed. The superheaters, which are\r\n  frequently fitted, consist of two cross-boxes or headers placed\r\n  transversely under the cylindrical drum and connected by numerous\r\n  C-shaped tubes. They are situated between the tubes and the\r\n  steam-chest, and are exposed to the heat of the furnace gases after\r\n  their first passage across the tubes. The steam is taken by an\r\n  internal pipe passing through the bottom of the drum into the upper\r\n  cross-box, then through the C tubes into the lower box, and thence to\r\n  the steam pipe. When steam is being raised, the superheater is flooded\r\n  with water, which is drained out through a blow-off pipe before\r\n  communication is opened with the steam-pipe. In large boilers of this\r\n  type, two steam-chests are placed side by side connected together by\r\n  two cross steam pipes and by the mud drum. Each, however, has its own\r\n  separate feed supply. The largest boiler made has two steam chests\r\n  4-1/2 ft. diameter by 25-1/2 ft. long, a grate surface of 85 sq. ft.,\r\n  and a total heating surface of 6182 sq. ft.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Stirling.\r\n\r\n  Another type of water-tube boiler in use for stationary purposes is\r\n  the \"Stirling\" (fig. 12). This boiler consists of four or five\r\n  horizontal drums, of which the three upper form the steam-space, and\r\n  the one or two lower contain water. The lower drums, where two are\r\n  fitted, are connected to each other at about the middle of their\r\n  height by horizontal tubes, and to the upper drums by numerous nearly\r\n  vertical tubes which form the major portion of the heating surfaces.\r\n  The central upper drum is at a slightly higher level than the others,\r\n  and communicates with that nearest the back of the boiler by a set of\r\n  curved tubes entirely above the water-level, and with the front drum\r\n  by two sets--the upper one being above and the lower below the\r\n  water-level. The whole boiler is enclosed in brickwork, into which the\r\n  supporting columns and girders are built. Brickwork baffles compel the\r\n  furnace gases to take specified courses among the tubes. It will be\r\n  seen that the space between the boiler front and the tubes form a\r\n  large combustion chamber into which all the furnace gases must pass\r\n  before they enter the spaces between the tubes; in this chamber a\r\n  baffle-bridge is sometimes built. Another chamber is formed between\r\n  the first and second sets of tubes. The feed-water enters the back\r\n  upper drum, and must pass down the third set of tubes into the lower\r\n  drum before it reaches the other parts of the boiler. Thus the coldest\r\n  water is always where the temperature of the furnace gases is lowest;\r\n  and as the current through the lower drum is slight, the solid matters\r\n  separated from the feed-water while its temperature is being raised\r\n  have an opportunity of settling to the bottom of this drum, where the\r\n  heating is not great and where therefore their presence will not be\r\n  injurious. When superheaters are required, they are made of two drums\r\n  connected by numerous small tubes, and are somewhat similar in\r\n  construction to the boiler proper. The superheater is placed between\r\n  the first and second sets of tubes, where it is exposed to the furnace\r\n  gases before too much heat has been taken from them. Arrangements are\r\n  provided for flooding the superheater while steam is being raised, and\r\n  for draining it before the steam is passed through it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 11.--Babcock & Wilcox Water-tube Boiler fitted\r\n  with Superheaters.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Woodeson.\r\n\r\n  A somewhat similar boiler is made by Messrs. Clarke, Chapman & Co.,\r\n  and is known as the \"Woodeson\" boiler (fig. 13). It consists of three\r\n  upper drums placed side by side connected together by numerous short\r\n  tubes, some above and some below the water-level, and of three smaller\r\n  lower drums also connected by short cross tubes. The upper and lower\r\n  drums are connected by numerous nearly vertical straight tubes. The\r\n  whole is enclosed in firebrick casing. The design permits of the\r\n  insides of all the tubes being readily inspected, and also of any tube\r\n  being taken out and renewed without displacing any other part of the\r\n  boiler.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Stirling Water-tube Boiler.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Belleville.\r\n\r\n  The earliest form of water-tube boiler which came into general use in\r\n  the British navy is the Belleville. Two views of this boiler are shown\r\n  in fig. 14. It is composed of two parts, the boiler proper and the\r\n  \"economizer.\" Each of these consists of several sets of elements\r\n  placed side by side; those of the boiler proper are situated\r\n  immediately over the fire, and those of the economizer in the uptake\r\n  above the boiler, the intervening space being designed to act as a\r\n  combustion chamber. Each element is constructed of a number of\r\n  straight tubes connected at their ends by means of screwed joints to\r\n  junction-boxes which are made of malleable cast iron. These are\r\n  arranged vertically over one another, and except in the case of the\r\n  upper and lower ones at the front of the boiler, each connects the\r\n  upper end of one tube with the lower end of the next tube of the\r\n  element. The boxes at the back of the boiler are all close-ended, but\r\n  those at the front are provided with a small oval hole, opposite to\r\n  each tube end, closed by an internal door with bolt and cross-bar; the\r\n  purpose of these openings is to permit the inside of the tubes to be\r\n  examined and cleaned. The lower front box of each element of the\r\n  boiler proper is connected to a horizontal cross-tube of square\r\n  section, called a \"feed-collector,\" which extends the whole width of\r\n  the boiler. When the boiler is not in use, any element can be readily\r\n  disconnected and a spare one inserted. The lower part of the\r\n  steam-chest is connected to the feed-collector by vertical pipes at\r\n  each end of the boiler, and prolongations of these pipes below the\r\n  level of the feed-collector form closed pockets for the collection of\r\n  sediment. The tubes are made of seamless steel. They are generally\r\n  about 4-1/2 in. in external diameter: the two lower rows are 3/8 in.\r\n  thick, the next two rows 5/16 and the remainder about 1/5 in. The\r\n  construction of the economizer is similar to that of the boiler\r\n  proper, but the tubes are shorter and smaller, being generally about\r\n  2-3/4 in. in diameter. The lower boxes of the economizer elements are\r\n  connected to a horizontal feed pipe which is kept supplied with water\r\n  by a feed-pumping engine, and the upper boxes are connected to another\r\n  horizontal pipe from which the heated feed-water is taken into the\r\n  steam-chest. Both the boiler proper and the economizer are enclosed in\r\n  a casing which is formed of two thicknesses of thin iron separated by\r\n  non-conducting material and lined with firebrick at the part between\r\n  the fire-bar level and the lower rows of tubes. Along the front of the\r\n  boiler, above the level of the firing-doors, there is a small tube\r\n  having several nozzles directed across the fire-grate, and supplied\r\n  with compressed air at a pressure of about 10 lb. per sq. in. In this\r\n  way not only is additional air supplied, but the gases issuing from\r\n  the fire are stirred up and mixed, their combustion being thereby\r\n  facilitated before they pass into the spaces between the tubes. A\r\n  similar air-tube is provided for the space between the boiler proper\r\n  and the economizer. Any water suspended in the steam is separated in a\r\n  special separator fitted in the main steam-pipe, and the steam is\r\n  further dried by passing through a reducing-valve, which ensures a\r\n  steady pressure on the engine side of the valve, notwithstanding\r\n  fluctuations of pressure in the boiler. The boiler pressure is usually\r\n  maintained at about 50 lb. per sq. in. in excess of that at which the\r\n  engines are working, the excess forming a reservoir of energy to\r\n  provide for irregular firing or feeding.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Woodeson Boiler (Messrs Clarke, Chapman &\r\n  Co.).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Belleville Boiler.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Niclausse.\r\n\r\n  Another type of large-tube boiler which has been used in the British\r\n  and in other navies is the \"Niclausse,\" shown in fig. 15. It is also\r\n  in use on land in several electric-light installations. It consists of\r\n  a horizontal steam-chest under which is placed a number of elements\r\n  arranged side by side over the fire, the whole being enclosed in an\r\n  iron casing lined with firebrick where it is exposed to the direct\r\n  action of the fire. Each element consists of a header of rectangular\r\n  cross-section, fitted with two rows of inclined close-ended tubes,\r\n  which slope downwards towards the back of the boiler with an\r\n  inclination of 6 deg. to the horizontal. The headers are usually of\r\n  malleable cast iron with diaphragms cast in them, but sometimes steel\r\n  has been employed, the bottoms being closed by a riveted steel plate,\r\n  and the diaphragms being made of the same material. The headers are\r\n  bolted to socket-pieces which are riveted to the bottom of the\r\n  steam-chest, so that any element may be easily removed. The tube-holes\r\n  are accurately bored, at an angle to suit the inclination of the\r\n  tubes, through both the front and back of the headers and through the\r\n  diaphragm, those in the header walls being slightly conical. The tubes\r\n  themselves, which are made of seamless steel, are of peculiar\r\n  construction. The lower or back ends are reduced in diameter and\r\n  screwed and fitted with cap-nuts which entirely close them. The front\r\n  ends are thickened by being upset, and the parts where they fit into\r\n  the header walls and in the diaphragm are carefully turned to gauge.\r\n  The upper and lower parts of the tubes between these fitting portions\r\n  are then cut away, the side portions only being retained, and the end\r\n  is termed a \"lanterne.\" A small water-circulating tube of thin sheet\r\n  steel, fitted inside each generating tube, is open at the lower end,\r\n  and at the other is secured to a smaller \"lanterne,\" which, however,\r\n  only extends from the front of the header to the diaphragm. This\r\n  smaller \"lanterne\" closes the front end of the generating tube. The\r\n  whole arrangement is such that when the tubes are in place only the\r\n  small inner circulating tubes communicate with the space between the\r\n  front of the header and the diaphragm, while the annular spaces in the\r\n  generating tubes around the water-circulating tubes communicate only\r\n  with the space between the diaphragm and the back of the header. The\r\n  steam formed in the tubes escapes from them into this back space,\r\n  through which it rises into the steam-chest, whilst the space in the\r\n  front of the header always contains a down-current of water supplying\r\n  the inner circulating tubes. The tubes are maintained in position by\r\n  cross-bars, each secured by one stud-bolt screwed into the header\r\n  front wall, and each serving to fix two tubes. The products of\r\n  combustion ascend directly from the fire amongst the tubes, and the\r\n  combustion is rendered more complete by the introduction of jets of\r\n  high-pressure air immediately over the fire, as in the \"Belleville\"\r\n  boiler.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Durr.\r\n\r\n  The \"Durr\" boiler, in use in several vessels in the German navy, and\r\n  in a few vessels of the British navy, in some respects resembles the\r\n  \"Niclausse.\" The separate headers of the latter, however, are replaced\r\n  by one large water-chamber formed of steel plates with welded joints,\r\n  and instead of the tubes being secured by \"lanternes\" to two plates\r\n  they are secured to the inner plate only by conical joints, the holes\r\n  in the outer plate being closed by small round doors fitted from the\r\n  inside. In fixing the tubes each is separately forced into its\r\n  position by means of a small portable hydraulic jack. The lower ends\r\n  of the caps are closed by cap-nuts made of a special heat-resisting\r\n  alloy of copper and manganese. Circulation is provided for by a\r\n  diaphragm in the water-chamber and by inner tubes as in the Niclausse\r\n  boiler. Baffle plates are fitted amongst the tubes to ensure a\r\n  circulation of the furnace gases amongst them. Above the main set of\r\n  tubes is a smaller set arranged horizontally, and connected directly\r\n  to the steam receiver. These are fitted with internal tubes, and an\r\n  internal diaphragm is provided so that steam from the chest circulates\r\n  through these tubes on its way to the stop-valves. This supplementary\r\n  set of tubes is intended to serve as a superheater, but the amount of\r\n  surface is not sufficient to obtain more than a very small amount of\r\n  superheat.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Yarrow.\r\n\r\n  The Yarrow boiler (fig. 16) is largely in use in the British and also\r\n  in several other navies. It consists of a large cylindrical steam\r\n  chest and two lower water-chambers, connected by numerous straight\r\n  tubes. In the boilers for large vessels all the tubes are of 1-3/4 in.\r\n  external diameter, but in the large express boilers the two rows\r\n  nearest to the fire on each side are of 1-1/4 in. and the remainder of\r\n  1 in. diameter. They are arranged with their centres forming\r\n  equilateral triangles, and are spaced so that they can be cleaned\r\n  externally both from the front of the boiler and also cross-ways in\r\n  two directions. In some boilers the lower part of the steam-chest is\r\n  connected with the water-chambers by large pipes outside the casings\r\n  with the view of improving the circulation.\r\n\r\n  The largest size of single-ended large tube boiler in use has a steam\r\n  drum 4 ft. 2 in. diameter, a grate area of 73.5 sq. ft. and 3750 sq.\r\n  ft. of heating surface, but much larger double-ended boilers have been\r\n  made, these being fired from both ends.\r\n\r\n  In most of the boilers made, access to the inside is obtained by\r\n  manholes in the steam-chest and water-chamber ends, but in the smaller\r\n  sizes fitted in torpedo boats the water-chambers are too small for\r\n  this, and they are each arranged in two parts connected by a bolted\r\n  joint, which makes all the tube ends accessible.\r\n\r\n  The Babcock & Wilcox marine boiler (fig. 17) is much used in the\r\n  American and British navies, and it has also been used in several\r\n  yachts and merchant steamers. It consists of a horizontal cylindrical\r\n  steam-chest placed transversely over a group of elements, beneath\r\n  which is the fire, the whole being enclosed in an iron casing lined\r\n  with firebrick. Each element consists of a front and back header\r\n  connected by numerous water-tubes which have a considerable\r\n  inclination to facilitate the circulation. The upper ends of the front\r\n  headers are situated immediately under the steam-chest and are\r\n  connected to it by short nipples; by a similar means they are\r\n  connected at the bottom to a pipe of square section which extends\r\n  across the width of the boiler. Additional connexions are made by\r\n  nearly vertical tubes between this cross-pipe and the bottom of the\r\n  steam-chest. The back headers are each connected at their upper ends\r\n  by means of two long horizontal tubes with the steam-chest, the bottom\r\n  ends of the headers being closed. The headers are made of wrought\r\n  steel, and except the outer pairs, which are flat on the outer\r\n  portions, they are sinuous on both sides, the sinuosities fitting into\r\n  one another. The tubes are of two sizes, the two lower rows and the\r\n  return tubes between the back headers and steam-chest being 3-15/16\r\n  in. outside diameter, and the remaining tubes 1-13/16 in. The small\r\n  tubes are arranged in groups of two or four to nearly all of the\r\n  sinuosities of the headers, the purpose of this arrangement being to\r\n  give opportunities for the furnace gases to become well mixed\r\n  together, and to ensure their contact with the heating surfaces.\r\n  Access for securing the tubes in the headers is provided by a hole\r\n  formed on the other side of the header opposite each of the tubes,\r\n  where they are grouped in fours, and by one larger hole opposite each\r\n  group of two tubes. The larger holes are oval, and are closed by\r\n  fittings similar to those used in the land boiler (fig. 18). The\r\n  smaller holes are conical, with the larger diameter on the inside,\r\n  and are closed by special conical fittings: the conical portion and\r\n  bolt are one forging, and the nut is close-ended. In case of the\r\n  breakage of the bolt, the fitting would be retained in place by the\r\n  steam-pressure. A set of firebrick baffles is placed so as to cover\r\n  rather more than half of the spaces between the upper of the two\r\n  bottom rows of large tubes, and another set of baffles covers about\r\n  two-thirds of the spaces between the upper small tubes. Vertical\r\n  baffles are also built between the smaller tubes, as shown in the\r\n  longitudinal section. These baffles compel the products of combustion\r\n  to circulate among the tubes in the direction shown by the arrows.\r\n  Experience has shown that this arrangement gives a better evaporative\r\n  efficiency than where the furnace gases are allowed to pass unbaffled\r\n  straight up between the tubes. The boilers are usually fitted in pairs\r\n  placed back to back, and one side of each is always made accessible.\r\n  On this side the casing is provided with numerous small doors, through\r\n  any of which a steam jet can be inserted for the purpose of sweeping\r\n  the tubes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG 15.--Niclausse Boiler--transverse section.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Express boilers.\r\n\r\n  A class of water-tube boilers largely in use in torpedo-boat\r\n  destroyers and cruisers, where the maximum of power is required in\r\n  proportion to the total weight of the installation, is generally known\r\n  as express boilers. In these the tubes are made of smaller diameter\r\n  than those used in the boilers already described, and the boilers are\r\n  designed to admit of a high rate of combustion of fuel obtained by a\r\n  high degree of \"forced draught.\" Of these express boilers the Yarrow\r\n  is of similar construction to the large tube Yarrow boiler already\r\n  described with the exception that the tubes are smaller in diameter\r\n  and much more closely arranged.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Normand.\r\n\r\n  In the Normand boiler (fig. 19) there are three chambers as in the\r\n  Yarrow, connected together by a large number of bent tubes which form\r\n  the heating surface, and also connected at each end by large outside\r\n  circulating tubes. The two outer rows of heating tubes on each side\r\n  are arranged to touch one another to nearly their whole length so as\r\n  to form a \"water-wall\" for the protection of the outer casing. They\r\n  enter the steam-chest at about the water-level. The two inner rows of\r\n  tubes, which are bent to the form shown in the figure, also form a\r\n  water-wall for the larger portion of the length of the boiler, and\r\n  thus compel the products of combustion to pass in a definite course\r\n  amongst all the tubes. In the Blechynden and White-Foster boilers\r\n  there are also three chambers connected by bent tubes, the curvature\r\n  being so arranged that in the former boiler any of the tubes can be\r\n  taken out of the boiler through small doors provided in the upper part\r\n  of the steam-chest, and in the White-Foster boiler they can be taken\r\n  out through the manhole in the end of the steam-chest.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Reed.\r\n\r\n  In the Reed boiler the tubes are longer and more curved than in the\r\n  Normand boiler, and there are no \"water-walls,\" the products of\r\n  combustion passing from the fire-grate amongst all the tubes direct to\r\n  the chimney. The special feature of the boiler is that each tube,\r\n  instead of being expanded into the tube plate, is fitted at each end\r\n  with specially designed screw and nut connexions to enable them to be\r\n  quickly taken out and replaced if necessary. At their lower ends the\r\n  tubes are reduced in diameter to enable smaller chambers to be used\r\n  than would otherwise be necessary. Provision is made for access to the\r\n  lower tube ends by means of numerous doors in the water-chambers.\r\n  Access to the top ends is obtained in the steam-chest.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Thornycroft.\r\n\r\n  Messrs John I. Thornycroft & Co. make two forms of express boiler. One\r\n  called the Thornycroft boiler consists of three chambers connected by\r\n  tubes which are straight for the major portion of their length but\r\n  bent at each end to enable them to enter the steam- and water-chambers\r\n  normally. The outer rows of tubes form \"water-walls\" at their lower\r\n  parts, but permit the passage of the gases between them at their upper\r\n  ends. Similarly the inner rows form \"water-walls\" at their upper\r\n  parts, but are open at the lower ends. The products of combustion are\r\n  thus compelled to pass over the whole of the heating surfaces. The\r\n  fire-rows of tubes in this boiler are made 1-3/8 in. outside diameter\r\n  and the remainder are made 1-3/8 in. diameter. Large outside\r\n  circulating pipes are provided at the front end of the boiler.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Thornycroft-Schulz.\r\n\r\n  In the other type of boiler, known as the Thornycroft-Schulz boiler\r\n  (fig. 20), there are four chambers, and the fire-grate is arranged in\r\n  two separate portions. The two outermost rows of tubes on each side\r\n  are arranged to form water-walls at their lower part, and permit the\r\n  gases to pass between them at the upper part. The rows nearest the\r\n  fires are arranged similarly to those in the Thornycroft boiler.\r\n  Circulation in the outer sets of tubes is arranged for by outer\r\n  circulating pipes of large diameter connecting the steam- and\r\n  water-chambers. For the middle water-chamber several nearly vertical\r\n  down-comers are provided in the centre of the boiler. Boilers of this\r\n  type are extensively used in the British and German navies.\r\n\r\n_Material of Boilers._--In ordinary land boilers and in marine boilers\r\nof all types the plates and stays are almost invariably made of mild\r\nsteel. For the shell plates and for long stays, a quality having a\r\ntensile strength ranging from 28 to 32 tons per sq. in. is usually\r\nemployed, and for furnaces and flues, for plates which have to be\r\nflanged, and for short-screwed stays, a somewhat softer steel with a\r\nstrength ranging from 26 to 30 tons per sq. in. is used. The tubes of\r\nordinary land and marine boilers are usually made of lap-welded wrought\r\niron. In water-tube boilers for naval purposes seamless steel tubes are\r\ninvariably used. In locomotive boilers the shells are generally of mild\r\nsteel, the fire-box plates of copper (in America of steel), the fire-box\r\nside stays of copper or special bronze, and other stays of steel. The\r\ntubes are usually of brass with a composition either of two parts by\r\nweight of copper to one of zinc or 70% copper, 30% zinc; sometimes,\r\nhowever, copper tubes and occasionally steel tubes are used. Where water\r\ntubes are used they are made of seamless steel.\r\n\r\n_Boiler Accessories._--All boilers must be provided with certain\r\nmountings and accessories. The water-level in them must be kept above\r\nthe highest part of the heating surfaces. In some land boilers, and in\r\nsome of the water-tube boilers used on shipboard, the feeding is\r\nautomatically regulated by mechanism actuated by a float, but in these\r\ncases means of regulating the feed-supply by hand are also provided. In\r\nmost boilers hand regulation only is relied upon. The actual level of\r\nwater in the boiler is ascertained by a glass water-gauge, which\r\nconsists of a glass tube and three cocks, two communicating directly\r\nwith the boiler, one above and one below the desired water-level, and\r\nthe third acting as a blow-out for cleaning the gauge and for testing\r\nits working. Three small try-cocks are also fitted, one just at, one\r\nabove, and one below the proper water-level. The feeding of the boiler\r\nis sometimes performed by a pump driven from the main engine, sometimes\r\nby an independent steam-pump, and sometimes by means of an injector. The\r\nfeed-water is admitted by a \"check-valve,\" the lift of which is\r\nregulated by a screw and hand-wheel, and which when the feed-pump is not\r\nworking is kept on its seating by the boiler pressure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Yarrow Water-tube Boiler.]\r\n\r\nEvery boiler is in addition supplied with a steam-gauge to indicate the\r\nsteam-pressure, with a stop-valve for regulating the admission of steam\r\nto the steam-pipes, and with one or two safety-valves. These last in\r\nstationary boilers usually consist of valves kept in their seats against\r\nthe steam-pressure in the boiler by levers carrying weights, but in\r\nmarine and locomotive boilers the valves are kept closed by means of\r\nsteel springs. One at least of the safety-valves is fitted with easing\r\ngear by which it can be lifted at any time for blowing off the steam.\r\nBlow-out cocks are fitted for emptying the boiler.\r\n\r\nOpenings must always be made in boilers for access for cleaning and\r\nexamination. When these are large enough to allow a man to enter the\r\nboiler they are termed man-holes. They are usually made oval, as this\r\nshape permits the doors by which they are closed to be placed on the\r\ninside so that the pressure upon them tends to keep them shut. The doors\r\nare held in place by one or two bolts, secured to cross-bars or \"dogs\"\r\noutside the boiler. It is important in making these doors that they\r\nshould fit the holes so accurately that the jointing material cannot be\r\nforced out of its proper position. In the few cases where doors are\r\nfitted outside a boiler, so that the steam-pressure tends to open them,\r\nthey are always secured by several bolts so that the breakage of one\r\nbolt will not allow the door to be forced off.\r\n\r\n_Water-softening._--Seeing that the impurities contained in the\r\nfeed-water are not evaporated in the steam they become concentrated in\r\nthe boiler water. Most of them become precipitated in the boiler either\r\nin the form of mud or else as scale which forms on the heating surfaces.\r\nSome of the mud and such of the impurities as remain soluble may be\r\nremoved by means of the blow-off cocks, but the scale can only be\r\nremoved by periodical cleaning. Incrustations on the heating surface not\r\nonly lessen the efficiency of the boiler by obstructing the transmission\r\nof heat through the plates and tubes, but if excessive they become a\r\nsource of considerable danger by permitting the plates to become\r\noverheated and thereby weakened. When the feed-water is very impure,\r\ntherefore, the boilers used are those which permit of very easy\r\ncleaning, such as the Lancashire, Galloway and Cornish types, to the\r\nexclusion of multitubular or water-tube boilers in which thorough\r\ncleaning is more difficult. In other cases, however, the feed-water is\r\npurified by passing it through some type of \"softener\" before pumping it\r\ninto the boiler. Most of the impurities in ordinary feed-water are\r\neither lime or magnesia salts, which although soluble in cold water are\r\nmuch less so in hot water. In the \"softener\" measured quantities of\r\nfeed-water and of some chemical reagents are thoroughly mixed and at the\r\nsame time the temperature is raised either by exhaust steam or by other\r\nmeans. Most of the impurity is thus precipitated, and some of the\r\nremainder is converted into more soluble salts which remain in solution\r\nin the boiler until blown out. The water is filtered before being pumped\r\ninto the boiler. The quantity and kind of chemical employed is\r\ndetermined according to the nature and amount of the impurity in the\r\n\"hard\" feed-water.\r\n\r\n_Thermal Storage._--In some cases where the work required is very\r\nintermittent, \"thermal storage\" is employed. Above the boiler a large\r\ncylindrical storage vessel is placed, having sufficient capacity to\r\ncontain enough feed-water to supply the boiler throughout the periods\r\nwhen the maximum output is required. The upper part of this storage\r\nvessel is always in free communication with the steam space of the\r\nboiler, and from the lower part of it the feed-water may be run into the\r\nboiler when required. The feed-water is delivered into the upper part of\r\nthe vessel, and arrangements are made by which before it falls to the\r\nbottom of the chamber it runs over very extended surfaces exposed to the\r\nsteam, its temperature being thus raised to that of the steam. At times\r\nwhen less than the normal supply of steam is required for the engine\r\nmore than the average quantity of feed-water is pumped into the chamber,\r\nand the excess accumulates with its temperature raised to the\r\nevaporation point. When an extra supply of steam is required, the\r\nfeed-pump is stopped and the boiler is fed with the hot water stored in\r\nthe chamber. Besides the \"storage\" effect, it is found that many of the\r\nimpurities of the feed become deposited in the chamber, where they are\r\ncomparatively harmless and from which they are readily removable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Longitudinal section.\r\n\r\nSection at AB--Front elevation.\r\n\r\nFIG. 17.--Bobcock & Wilcox Water-tube Boiler (marine type).]\r\n\r\n_Oil Separators._--When the steam from the engines is condensed and used\r\nas feed-water, as is the case with marine boilers, much difficulty is\r\noften experienced with the oil which passes over with the steam.\r\nFeed-filters are employed to stop the coarser particles of the oil, but\r\nsome of the oil becomes \"emulsified\" or suspended in the water in such\r\nextremely minute particles that they pass through the finest filtering\r\nmaterials. On the evaporation of the water in the boiler, this oil is\r\nleft as a thin film upon the heating surfaces, and by preventing the\r\nactual contact of water with the plates has been the cause of serious\r\ntrouble. An attempt has been made to overcome the emulsion difficulty by\r\nuniformly mixing with the water a small quantity of solution of lime. On\r\nthe water being raised in temperature the lime is precipitated, and the\r\nminute particles separated apparently attract the small globules of oil\r\nand become aggregated in sufficient size to deposit themselves in quiet\r\nparts of the boiler, whence they can be occasionally removed either by\r\nblowing out or by cleaning. Much, however, still remains to be done\r\nbefore the oil difficulty will be thoroughly removed.\r\n\r\n_Corrosion._--When chemicals of any kind are used to soften or purify\r\nfeed-water it is essential that neither they nor the products they form\r\nshould have a corrosive effect upon the boiler-plates, &c. Much of the\r\ncorrosion which occasionally occurs has been traced to the action of the\r\noxygen of the air which enters the boiler in solution in the feed-water,\r\nand the best practice now provides for the delivery of the feed into the\r\nboiler at such positions that the air evolved from it as it becomes\r\nheated passes direct to the steam space without having an opportunity of\r\nbecoming disengaged upon the under-water surfaces of the boiler.\r\n\r\nWhere corrosion is feared it is usual to fit zinc slabs in the water\r\nspaces of the boiler. Experience shows that it is better to make them of\r\nrolled rather than of cast zinc, and to secure them on studs which can\r\nbe kept bright, so as to ensure a direct metallic contact between the\r\nzinc and the boiler-plate. The function of the zinc is to set up\r\ngalvanic action; it plays the part of the negative metal, and is\r\ndissolved while the metal of the shell is kept electro-positive. Care\r\nmust always be taken that the fragments which break off the zinc as it\r\nwastes away cannot fall upon the heating surfaces of the boiler.\r\n\r\n_Evaporators._--In marine boilers the waste of water which occurs from\r\nleakages in the cycle of the evaporation in the boiler, use in the\r\nengine, condensation in the condenser and return to the boiler as\r\nfeed-water, is made up by fresh water distilled from sea-water in\r\n\"evaporators.\" Of these there are many forms with different provisions\r\nfor cleaning the coils, but they are all identical in principle. They\r\nare fed with sea-water, and means are provided for blowing out the brine\r\nproduced in them when some of the water is evaporated. The heat required\r\nfor the evaporation is obtained from live steam from the boilers, which\r\nis admitted into coils of copper pipe. The water condensed in these\r\ncoils is returned direct to the feed-water, and the steam evaporated\r\nfrom the sea-water is led either into the low-pressure receiver of the\r\nsteam-engine or into the condenser.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Handhole Fittings.]\r\n\r\n_Efficiency of Boilers._--The useful work obtained from any boiler\r\ndepends upon many considerations. For a high efficiency, that is, a\r\nlarge amount of steam produced in proportion to the amount of fuel\r\nconsumed, different conditions have to be fulfilled from those required\r\nwhere a large output of steam from a given plant is of more importance\r\nthan economy of fuel. For a high efficiency, completeness of combustion\r\nof fuel must be combined with sufficient heating surface to absorb so\r\nmuch of the heat produced as will reduce the temperature of the funnel\r\ngases to nearly that of steam. Completeness of combustion can only be\r\nobtained by admitting considerably more air to the fire than is\r\ntheoretically necessary fully to oxidize the combustible portions of the\r\nfuel, and by providing sufficient time and opportunity for a thorough\r\nmixture of the air and furnace gases to take place before the\r\ntemperature is lowered to that critical point below which combustion\r\nwill not take place. It is generally considered that the amount of\r\nexcess air required is nearly equal to that theoretically necessary;\r\nexperience, however, tends to show that much less than this is really\r\nrequired if proper means are provided for ensuring an early complete\r\nmixture of the gases. Different means are needed to effect this with\r\ndifferent kinds of coal, those necessary for properly burning Welsh coal\r\nbeing altogether unsuitable for use with North Country or Scottish coal.\r\nAs all the excess air has to be raised to the same temperature as that\r\nof the really burnt gases, it follows that an excess of air passing\r\nthrough the fire lowers the temperature in the fire and flues, and\r\ntherefore lessens the heat transmission; and as it leaves the boiler at\r\na high temperature it carries off some of the heat produced. A reduction\r\nof the amount of air, therefore, may, by increasing the fire temperature\r\nand lessening the chimney waste, actually increase the efficiency even\r\nif at the same time it is accompanied by a slight incompleteness of\r\ncombustion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Normand Boiler.]\r\n\r\n_Mechanical Stoking._--Most boilers are hand-fired, a system involving\r\nmuch labour and frequent openings of the furnace doors, whereby large\r\nquantities of cold air are admitted above the fires. Many systems of\r\nmechanical stoking have been tried, but none has been found free from\r\nobjections. That most usually employed is known as the \"chain-grate\"\r\nstoker. In this system, which is illustrated in fig. 13 (Woodeson\r\nboiler), the grate consists of a wide endless chain formed of short\r\ncast-iron bars; this passes over suitable drums at the front and back of\r\nthe boiler, by the slow rotation of which the grate travels very slowly\r\nfrom front to back. The coal, which is broken small, is fed from a\r\nhopper over the whole width of the grate, the thickness of the fire\r\nbeing regulated by a door which can be raised or lowered as desired.\r\nThus the volatile portions of the coal are distilled at the front of the\r\nfire, and pass over the incandescent fuel at the back end. The speed of\r\ntravel is so regulated that by the time the remaining parts of the fuel\r\nreach the back end the combustion is nearly complete. It will be seen\r\nthat the fire becomes thinner towards the back, and too much air is\r\nprevented from entering the thin portion by means of vanes actuated from\r\nthe front of the boiler.\r\n\r\n_Draught._--In most boilers the draught necessary for combustion is\r\n\"natural,\" i.e. produced by a chimney. For marine purposes, although\r\n\"natural\" draught is the more common, many boiler installations are\r\nfitted with \"forced\" draught arrangements. Two distinct systems are\r\nused. In that known as the \"closed stokehold\" the stokehold compartment\r\nof the vessel is so closed that the only exit for air from it is through\r\nthe fires. Air is driven into the stokehold by means of fans which are\r\nmade so that they can maintain an air pressure in the stokehold above\r\nthat of the outside atmosphere. This is the system almost universally\r\nadopted in war vessels, and it is used also in some fast passenger\r\nships. The air pressure usually adopted in large vessels is that\r\ncorresponding to a height of from 1 to 1-1/2 in. of water, whilst so much\r\nas 4 in. is sometimes used in torpedo-boats and similar craft. This is,\r\nof course, in addition to the chimney-draught due to the height of the\r\nfunnel. In the closed ashpit or Howden system, the stokehold is open,\r\nand fans drive the air round a number of tubes, situated in the uptake,\r\nthrough which the products of combustion pass on their way to the\r\nchimney. The air thus becomes heated, and part of it is then delivered\r\ninto the ashpit below the fire and part into a casing round the furnace\r\nfront from which it enters the furnace above the fire. In locomotive\r\nboilers the draught is produced by the blast or the exhaust steam. With\r\nnatural draught a combustion of about 15 to 20 lb. of coal per sq. ft.\r\nof grate area per hour can be obtained. With forced draught much greater\r\nrates can be maintained, ranging from 20 lb. to 35 lb. in the larger\r\nvessels with a moderate air pressure, to as much as 70 and even 80 lb\r\nper sq. ft. in the express types of boiler used in torpedo boats and\r\nsimilar craft.\r\n\r\n_Performance of Boilers._--The makers of several types of boilers have\r\npublished particulars regarding the efficiency of the boilers they\r\nconstruct, but naturally these results have been obtained under the most\r\nfavourable circumstances which may not always represent the conditions\r\nof ordinary working. The following table of actual results of marine\r\nboiler trials, made at the instance of the British admiralty, is\r\nparticularly useful because the trials were made with great care under\r\nworking conditions, the whole of the coal being weighed and the\r\nfeed-water measured throughout the trials by skilled observers. The\r\nvarious trials can be compared amongst themselves as South Welsh coal of\r\nexcellent quality was used in all cases.\r\n\r\nIn experimental tests such as those above referred to, many conditions\r\nhave to be taken into account, the principal being the duration of the\r\ntrial. It is essential that the condition of the boiler at the\r\nconclusion of the test should be precisely the same as at the\r\ncommencement, both as regards the quantity of unconsumed coals on the\r\nfire-grate and the quantity of water and the steam-pressure in the\r\nboiler. The longer the period over which the observations are taken the\r\nless is the influence of errors in the estimation of these particulars.\r\nFurther, in order properly to represent working conditions, the rate of\r\ncombustion of the fuel throughout the trial must be the same as that\r\nintended to be used in ordinary working, and the duration of the test\r\nmust be sufficient to include proportionately as much cleaning of fires\r\nas would occur under the normal working conditions. The tests should\r\nalways be made with the kind of coal intended to be generally used, and\r\nthe records should include a test of the calorific value of a sample of\r\nthe fuel carefully selected so as fairly to represent the bulk of the\r\ncoal used during the trial. The periodic records taken are the weights\r\nof the fuel used and of the ashes, &c., produced, the temperature and\r\nquantity of the feed-water, the steam pressure maintained, and the\r\nwetness of the steam produced. This last should be ascertained from\r\nsamples taken from the steam pipe at a position where the full pressure\r\nis maintained. In order to reduce to a common standard observations\r\ntaken under different conditions of feed temperatures and steam\r\npressures, the results are calculated to an equivalent evaporation at\r\nthe atmospheric pressure from a feed temperature of 212 deg.

In\r\n    the last trial retarders were used.\r\n\r\n  [2] In this trial retarders were used in the tubes.\r\n\r\n  [3] The first four trials were made with horizontal baffles above the\r\n    tubes; the last two trials with the baffling described in the text.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILER MAKING.\r\n\r\nThe practice of the boiler, bridge and girder shops may here be\r\nconveniently treated together, because similar materials and methods are\r\nemployed in each, notwithstanding that many points of divergence in\r\npractice generally relegate them to separate departments. The materials\r\nused are chiefly iron and steel. The methods mostly adopted are those\r\ninvolved in the working of plates and rolled sections, which vastly\r\npredominate over the bars and rods used chiefly in the smithy. But there\r\nare numerous differences in methods of construction. Flanging occupies a\r\nlarge place in boilermaking, for end-plates, tube-plates, furnace flues,\r\n&c., but is scarcely represented in bridge and girder work. Plates are\r\nbent to cylindrical shapes in boilermaking, for shells and furnaces, but\r\nnot in girder work. Welding is much more common in the first than in the\r\nsecond, furnace flues being always welded and stand pipes frequently. In\r\nboiler work holes are generally drilled through the seams of adjacent\r\nplates. In bridge work each plate or bar is usually drilled or punched\r\napart from its fellows. Boilers, again, being subject to high\r\ntemperatures and pressures, must be constructed with provisions to\r\nensure some elasticity and freedom of movement under varying\r\ntemperatures to prevent fractures or grooving, and must be made of\r\nmaterials that combine high ductility with strength when heated to\r\nfurnace temperatures. Flanging of certain parts, judicious staying,\r\nlimitation of the length of the tubes, the forms of which are\r\ninherently weak, provide for the first; the selection of steel or iron\r\nof high percentage elongation, and the imposition of temper, or bending\r\ntests, both hot and cold, provide for the second.\r\n\r\nThe following are the leading features of present-day methods.\r\n\r\n  It might be hastily supposed that, because plates, angles, tees,\r\n  channels and joist sections are rolled ready for use, little work\r\n  could be left for the plater and boilermaker. But actually so much is\r\n  involved that subdivisions of tasks are numerous; the operations of\r\n  templet-making, rolling, planing, punching and shearing, bending,\r\n  welding and forging, flanging, drilling, riveting, caulking, and\r\n  tubing require the labours of several groups of machine attendants,\r\n  and of gangs of unskilled labourers or helpers. Some operations also\r\n  have to be done at a red or white heat, others cold. To the first\r\n  belong flanging and welding, to the latter generally all the other\r\n  operations. Heating is necessary for the rolling of tubes of small\r\n  diameter; bending is done cold or hot according to circumstances.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 20.--Thornycroft-Schulz Water-tube Boiler.]\r\n\r\n  The fact that some kinds of treatment, as shearing and punching,\r\n  flanging and bending, are of a very violent character explains why\r\n  practice has changed radically in regard to the method of performing\r\n  these operations in cases where safety is a cardinal matter. Shearing\r\n  and punching are both severely detrusive operations performed on cold\r\n  metal; both leave jagged edges and, as experience has proved, very\r\n  minute cracks, the tendency of which is to extend under subsequent\r\n  stress, with liability to produce fracture. But it has been found\r\n  that, when a shorn edge is planed and a punched hole enlarged by\r\n  reamering, no harm results, provided not less than about 1/16 in. is\r\n  removed. A great advance was therefore made when specifications first\r\n  insisted on the removal of the rough edges before the parts were\r\n  united.\r\n\r\n  In the work of riveting another evil long existed. When holes are\r\n  punched it is practically impossible to ensure the exact coincidence\r\n  of holes in different plates which have to be brought together for the\r\n  purpose of riveting. From this followed the use of the drift,--a\r\n  tapered rod driven forcibly by hammer blows through corresponding\r\n  holes in adjacent plates, by which violent treatment the holes were\r\n  forcibly drawn into alignment. This drifting stressed the plates,\r\n  setting up permanent strains and enlarging incipient cracks, and many\r\n  boiler explosions have been clearly traceable to the abuse of this\r\n  tool. Then, next, specifications insisted that all holes should be\r\n  enlarged by reamering _after_ the plates were in place. But even that\r\n  did not prove a safeguard, because it often happened that the metal\r\n  reamered was nearly all removed from one side of a hole, so leaving\r\n  the other side just as the punch had torn it. Ultimately came the era\r\n  of drilling rivet-holes, to which there is no exception now in\r\n  high-class boiler work. For average girder and bridge work the\r\n  practice of punching and reamering is still in use, because the\r\n  conditions of service are not so severe as are those in steam boilers.\r\n\r\n  Flanging signifies the turning or bending over of the edges of a\r\n  plate to afford a means of union to other plates. Examples occur in\r\n  the back end-plates of Lancashire and Cornish boilers, the front and\r\n  back plates of marine boilers, the fire-boxes of locomotive boilers,\r\n  the crowns of vertical boilers, the ends of conical cross-tubes, and\r\n  the Adamson seams of furnace flues. This practice has superseded the\r\n  older system of effecting union by means of rings forming two sides of\r\n  a rectangular section (angle iron rings). These were a fruitful source\r\n  of grooving and explosions in steam boilers, because their sharp\r\n  angular form lacked elasticity; hence the reason for the substitution\r\n  of a flange turned with a large radius, which afforded the elasticity\r\n  necessary to counteract the effects of changes in temperature. In\r\n  girder work where such conditions do not exist, the method of union\r\n  with angles is of course retained. In the early days of flanging the\r\n  process was performed in detail by a skilled workman (the angle\r\n  ironsmith), and it is still so done in small establishments. A length\r\n  of edge of about 10 in. or a foot is heated, and bent by hammering\r\n  around the edge of a block of iron of suitable shape. Then another\r\n  \"heat\" is taken and flanged, and another, until the work is complete.\r\n  But in modern boiler shops little hand work is ever done; instead,\r\n  plates 4 ft., 6 ft., or 8 ft. in diameter, and fire-box plates for\r\n  locomotive boilers, have their entire flanges bent at a single squeeze\r\n  between massive dies in a hydraulic press. In the case of the ends of\r\n  marine boilers which are too large for such treatment, a special form\r\n  of press bends the edges over in successive heats. The flanges of\r\n  Adamson seams are rolled over in a special machine. A length of flue\r\n  is rotated on a table, while the flange is turned over within a minute\r\n  between revolving rollers. There is another advantage in the adoption\r\n  of machine-flanging, besides the enormous saving of time, namely, that\r\n  the material suffers far less injury than it does in hand-flanging.\r\n\r\n  These differences in practice would not have assumed such magnitude\r\n  but for the introduction of mild steel in place of malleable iron.\r\n  Iron suffers less from overheating and irregular heating than does\r\n  steel. Steel possesses higher ductility, but it is also more liable to\r\n  develop cracks if subjected to improper treatment. All this and much\r\n  more is writ large in the early testing of steel, and is reflected in\r\n  present-day practice.\r\n\r\n  A feature peculiar to the boiler and plating shops is the enormous\r\n  number of rivet holes which have to be made, and of rivets to be\r\n  inserted. These requirements are reflected in machine design. To punch\r\n  or drill holes singly is too slow a process in the best practice, and\r\n  so machines are made for producing many holes simultaneously. Besides\r\n  this, the different sections of boilers are drilled in machines of\r\n  different types, some for shells, some for furnaces, some peculiar to\r\n  the shells or furnaces of one type of boilers, others to those of\r\n  another type only. And generally now these machines not only drill,\r\n  but can also be adjusted to drill to exact pitch, the necessity thus\r\n  being avoided of marking out the holes as guides to the drills.\r\n\r\n  Hand-riveting has mostly been displaced by hydraulic and pneumatic\r\n  machines, with resulting great saving in cost, and the advantage of\r\n  more trustworthy and uniform results. For boiler work, machines are\r\n  mostly of fixed type; for bridge and girder work they are portable,\r\n  being slung from chains and provided with pressure water or compressed\r\n  air by systems of flexible pipes.\r\n\r\n  Welding fills a large place in boiler work, but it is that of the\r\n  edges of plates chiefly, predominating over that of the bars and rods\r\n  of the smithy. The edges to be united are thin and long, so that short\r\n  lengths have to be done in succession at successive \"heats.\" Much of\r\n  this is hand work, and \"gluts\" or insertion pieces are generally\r\n  preferred to overlapping joints. But in large shops, steam-driven\r\n  power hammers are used for closing the welds. Parts that are commonly\r\n  welded are the furnace flues, the conical cross-tubes and angle rings.\r\n\r\n  Another aspect of the work of these departments is the immense\r\n  proportions of the modern machine tools used. This development is due\r\n  in great degree to the substitution of steel for iron. The steel\r\n  shell-plates of the largest boilers are 1-1/2 in. thick, and these\r\n  have to be bent into cylindrical forms. In the old days of iron\r\n  boilers the capacity of rolls never exceeded about 3/4 in. plate.\r\n  Often, alternatively to rolling, these thick plates are bent by\r\n  squeezing them in successive sections between huge blocks operated by\r\n  hydraulic pressure acting on toggle levers. And other machines besides\r\n  the rolls are made more massive than formerly to deal with the immense\r\n  plates of modern marine boilers.\r\n\r\n  The boiler and plating shops have been affected by the general\r\n  tendency to specialize manufactures. Firms have fallen into the\r\n  practice of restricting their range of product, with increase in\r\n  volume. The time has gone past when a single shop could turn out\r\n  several classes of boilers, and undertake any bridge and girder work\r\n  as well. One reason is to be found in the diminution of hand work and\r\n  the growth of the machine tool. Almost every distinct operation on\r\n  every section of a boiler or bridge may now be accomplished by one of\r\n  several highly specialized machines. Repetitive operations are\r\n  provided for thus, and by a system of templeting. If twenty or fifty\r\n  similar boilers are made in a year, each plate, hole, flange or stay\r\n  will be exactly like every similar one in the set. Dimensions of\r\n  plates will be marked from a sample or templet plate, and holes will\r\n  be marked similarly; or in many cases they are not marked at all, but\r\n  pitched and drilled at once by self-acting mechanism embodied in\r\n  drilling machines specially designed for one set of operations on one\r\n  kind of plate. Hundreds of bracing bars for bridges and girders will\r\n  be cut off all alike, and drilled or punched from a templet bar, so\r\n  that they are ready to take their place in bridge or girder without\r\n  any adjustments or fitting.     (J. G. H.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILING TO DEATH, a punishment once common both in England and on the\r\ncontinent. The only extant legislative notice of it in England occurs in\r\nan act passed in 1531 during the reign of Henry VIII., providing that\r\nconvicted poisoners should be boiled to death; it is, however,\r\nfrequently mentioned earlier as a punishment for coining. The\r\n_Chronicles of the Grey Friars_ (published by the Camden Society, 1852)\r\nhave an account of boiling for poisoning at Smithfield in the year 1522,\r\nthe man being fastened to a chain and lowered into boiling water several\r\ntimes until he died. The preamble of the statute of Henry VIII. (which\r\nmade poisoning treason) in 1531 recites that one Richard Roose (or\r\nCoke), a cook, by putting poison in some food intended for the household\r\nof the bishop of Rochester and for the poor of the parish of Lambeth,\r\nkilled a man and woman. He was found guilty of treason and sentenced to\r\nbe boiled to death without benefit of clergy. He was publicly boiled at\r\nSmithfield. In the same year a maid-servant for poisoning her mistress\r\nwas boiled at King's Lynn. In 1542 Margaret Davy, a servant, for\r\npoisoning her employer, was boiled at Smithfield. In the reign of Edward\r\nVI., in 1547, the act was repealed.\r\n\r\n  See also W. Andrews, _Old Time Punishments_ (Hull, 1890); _Notes and\r\n  Queries_, vol. i. (1862), vol. ix. (1867); Du Cange (s.v. _Caldariis\r\n  decoquere_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOIS BRULES, or BRULES (a French translation of their Indian name\r\nSICHANGU), a sub-tribe of North American Dakota Indians (Teton river\r\ndivision). The name is most frequently associated with the half-breeds\r\nin Manitoba, who in 1869 came into temporary prominence in connexion\r\nwith Riel's Rebellion (see RED RIVER); at that time they had lost all\r\ntribal purity, and were alternatively called _Metis_ (half-castes), the\r\nmajority being descendants of French-Canadians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOISE, a city and the county-seat of Ada county, Idaho, U.S.A., and the\r\ncapital of the state, situated on the N. side of the Boise river, in the\r\nS.W. part of the state, at an altitude of about 2700 ft. Pop. (1890)\r\n2311; (1900) 5957; (1910) 17,358. It is served by the Oregon Short Line\r\nrailway, being the terminus of a branch connecting with the main line at\r\nNampa, about 20 m. W.; and by electric lines connecting with Caldwell\r\nand Nampa. The principal buildings are the state capitol, the United\r\nStates assay office, a Carnegie library, a natatorium, and the Federal\r\nbuilding, containing the post office, the United States circuit and\r\ndistrict court rooms, and a U.S. land office. Boise is the seat of the\r\nstate school for the deaf and blind (1906), and just outside the city\r\nlimits are the state soldiers' home and the state penitentiary. About 2\r\nm. from the city are Federal barracks. Hot water (175 deg. F.) from\r\nartesian wells near the city is utilized for the natatorium and to heat\r\nmany residences and public buildings. The Boise valley is an excellent\r\ncountry for raising apples, prunes and other fruits. The manufactured\r\nproducts of the city are such as are demanded by a mining country,\r\nprincipally lumber, flour and machine-shop products. Boise is the trade\r\ncentre of the surrounding fruit-growing, agricultural and mining\r\ncountry, and is an important wool market. The oldest settlement in the\r\nvicinity was made by the Hudson's Bay Fur Company on the west side of\r\nthe Boise river, before 1860; the present city, chartered in 1864, dates\r\nfrom 1863. After 1900 the city grew very rapidly, principally owing to\r\nthe great irrigation schemes in southern Idaho; the water for the\r\nimmense Boise-Payette irrigation system is taken from the Boise, 8 m.\r\nabove the city. (See IDAHO.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOISGOBEY, FORTUNE DU (1824-1891), French writer of fiction, whose real\r\nsurname was Castille, was born at Granville (Manche) on the 11th of\r\nSeptember 1824. He served in the army pay department in Algeria from\r\n1844 to 1848, and extended his travels to the East. He made his literary\r\ndebut in the _Petit journal_ with a story entitled _Deux comediens_\r\n(1868). With _Le Forcat colonel_ (1872) he became one of the most\r\npopular feuilleton writers. His police stories, though not so convincing\r\nas those of Emile Gaboriau, with whom his name is generally associated,\r\nhad a great circulation, and many of them have been translated into\r\nEnglish. Among his stories may be mentioned: _Les Mysteres du nouveau\r\nParis_ (1876), _Le Demi-Monde sous la Terreur_ (1877), _Les Nuits de\r\nConstantinople_ (1882), _Le Cri du sang_ (1885), _La Main froide_\r\n(1889). Boisgobey died on the 26th of February 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOISGUILBERT, PIERRE LE PESANT, SIEUR DE (1676-1714), French economist,\r\nwas born at Rouen of an ancient noble family of Normandy, allied to that\r\nof Corneille. He received his classical education in Rouen, entered the\r\nmagistracy and became judge at Montivilliers, near Havre. In 1690 he\r\nbecame president of the _bailliage_ of Rouen, a post which he retained\r\nalmost until his death, leaving it to his son. In these two situations\r\nhe made a close study of local economic conditions, personally\r\nsupervising the cultivation of his lands, and entering into relations\r\nwith the principal merchants of Rouen. He was thus led to consider the\r\nmisery of the people under the burden of taxation. In 1695 he published\r\nhis principal work, _Le Detail de la France; la cause de la diminution\r\nde ses biens, et la facilite du remede_.... In it he drew a picture of\r\nthe general ruin of all classes of Frenchmen, caused by the bad economic\r\nregime. In opposition to Colbert's views he held that the wealth of a\r\ncountry consists, not in the abundance of money which it possesses but\r\nin what it produces and exchanges. The remedy for the evils of the time\r\nwas not so much the reduction as the equalization of the imposts, which\r\nwould allow the poor to consume more, raise the production and add to\r\nthe general wealth. He demanded the reform of the _taille_, the\r\nsuppression of internal customs duties and greater freedom of trade. In\r\nhis _Factum de la France_, published in 1705 or 1706, he gave a more\r\nconcise _resume_ of his ideas. But his proposal to substitute for all\r\naides and customs duties a single capitation tax of a tenth of the\r\nrevenue of all property was naturally opposed by the farmers of taxes\r\nand found little support. Indeed his work, written in a diffuse and\r\ninelegant style, passed almost unnoticed. Saint Simon relates that he\r\nonce asked a hearing of the comte de Pontchartrain, saying that he would\r\nat first believe him mad, then become interested, and then see he was\r\nright. Pontchartrain bluntly told him that he did think him mad, and\r\nturned his back on him. With Michel de Chamillart, whom he had known as\r\nintendant of Rouen (1689-1690), he had no better success. Upon the\r\ndisgrace of Vauban, whose _Dime royale_ had much in common with\r\nBoisguilbert's plan, Boisguilbert violently attacked the controller in a\r\npamphlet, _Supplement au detail de la France_. The book was seized and\r\ncondemned, and its author exiled to Auvergne, though soon allowed to\r\nreturn. At last in 1710 the controller-general, Nicolas Desmarets,\r\nestablished a new impost, the \"tenth\" (_dixieme_), which had some\r\nanalogy with the project of Boisguilbert. Instead of replacing the\r\nformer imposts, however, Desmarets simply added his _dixieme_ to them;\r\nthe experiment was naturally disastrous, and the idea was abandoned.\r\n\r\n  In 1712 appeared a _Testament politique de M. de Vauban_, which is\r\n  simply Boisguilbert's _Detail de la France_. Vauban's _Dime royale_\r\n  was formerly wrongly attributed to him. Boisguilbert's works were\r\n  collected by Daire in the first volume of the _Collection des grands\r\n  economistes_. His letters are in the _Correspondance des controleurs\r\n  generaux_, vol. i., published by M. de Boislisle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOISROBERT, FRANCOIS LE METEL DE (1592-1662), French poet, was born at\r\nCaen in 1592. He was trained for the law, and practised for some time at\r\nthe bar at Rouen. About 1622 he went to Paris, and by the next year had\r\nestablished a footing at court, for he had a share in the ballet of the\r\n_Bacchanales_ performed at the Louvre in February. He accompanied an\r\nembassy to England in 1625, and in 1630 visited Rome, where he won the\r\nfavour of Urban VIII. by his wit. He took orders, and was made a canon\r\nof Rouen. He had been introduced to Richelieu in 1623, and by his humour\r\nand his talent as a raconteur soon made himself indispensable to the\r\ncardinal. Boisrobert became one of the five poets who carried out\r\nRichelieu's dramatic ideas. He had a passion for play, and was a friend\r\nof Ninon de l'Enclos; and his enemies found ready weapons against him\r\nin the undisguised looseness of his life. He was more than once\r\ndisgraced, but never for long, although in his later years he was\r\ncompelled to give more attention to his duties as a priest. It was\r\nBoisrobert who suggested to Richelieu the plan of the Academy, and he\r\nwas one of its earliest and most active members. Rich as he was through\r\nthe benefices conferred on him by his patron, he was liberal to men of\r\nletters. After the death of Richelieu, he attached himself to Mazarin,\r\nwhom he served faithfully throughout the Fronde. He died on the 30th of\r\nMarch 1662. He wrote a number of comedies, to one of which, _La Belle\r\nPlaideuse_, Moliere's _L'Avare_ is said to owe something; and also some\r\nvolumes of verse. The licentious _Contes_, published under the name of\r\nhis brother D'Ouville, are often attributed to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOISSARD, JEAN JACQUES (1528-1602), French antiquary and Latin poet, was\r\nborn at Besancon. He studied at Louvain; but, disgusted by the severity\r\nof his master, he secretly left that seminary, and after traversing a\r\ngreat part of Germany reached Italy, where he remained several years and\r\nwas often reduced to great straits. His residence in Italy developed in\r\nhis mind a taste for antiquities, and he soon formed a collection of the\r\nmost curious monuments from Rome and its vicinity. He then visited the\r\nislands of the Archipelago, with the intention of travelling through\r\nGreece, but a severe illness obliged him to return to Rome. Here he\r\nresumed his favourite pursuits with great ardour, and having completed\r\nhis collection, returned to his native country; but not being permitted\r\nto profess publicly the Protestant religion, which he had embraced some\r\ntime before, he withdrew to Metz, where he died on the 30th of October\r\n1602. His most important works are: _Poemata_ (1574); _Emblemata_\r\n(1584); _Icones Virorum Illustrium_ (1597); _Vitae et Icones Sultanorum\r\nTurcicorum_, &c. (1597); _Theatrum Vitae Humanae_ (1596); _Romanae Urbis\r\nTopographia_ (1597-1602), now very rare; _De Divinatione et Magicis\r\nPraestigiis_ (1605); _Habitus Variarum Orbis Gentium_ (1581), ornamented\r\nwith seventy illuminated figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOISSIER, MARIE LOUIS ANTOINE GASTON (1823-1908), French classical\r\nscholar, and secretary of the French Academy, was born at Nimes on the\r\n15th of August 1823. The Roman monuments of his native town very early\r\nattracted Gaston Boissier to the study of ancient history. He made\r\nepigraphy his particular theme, and at the age of twenty-three became a\r\nprofessor of rhetoric at Angouleme, where he lived and worked for ten\r\nyears without further ambition. A travelling inspector of the\r\nuniversity, however, happened to hear him lecture, and Boissier was\r\ncalled to Paris to be professor at the Lycee Charlemagne. He began his\r\nliterary career by a thesis on the poet Attius (1857) and a study on the\r\nlife and work of M. Terentius Varro (1861). In 1861 he was made\r\nprofessor of Latin oratory at the College de France, and he became an\r\nactive contributor to the _Revue des deux mondes_. In 1865 he published\r\n_Ciceron et ses amis_ (Eng. trans, by A.D. Jones, 1897), which has\r\nenjoyed a success such as rarely falls to the lot of a work of\r\nerudition. In studying the manners of ancient Rome, Boissier had learned\r\nto re-create its society and to reproduce its characteristics with\r\nexquisite vivacity. In 1874 he published _La Religion romaine d'Auguste\r\naux Antonins_ (2 vols.), in which he analysed the great religious\r\nmovement of antiquity that preceded the acceptance of Christianity. In\r\n_L'Opposition sous les Cesars_ (1875) he drew a remarkable picture of\r\nthe political decadence of Rome under the early successors of Augustus.\r\nBy this time Boissier had drawn to himself the universal respect of\r\nscholars and men of letters, and on the death of H.J.G. Patin, the\r\nauthor of _Etudes sur les tragiques grecs_, in 1876, he was elected a\r\nmember of the French Academy, of which he was appointed perpetual\r\nsecretary in 1895.\r\n\r\nHis later works include _Promenades archeologiques: Rome et Pompei_\r\n(1880; second series, 1886); _L'Afrique romaine, promenades\r\narcheologiques_ (1901); _La Fin du paganisme_ (2 vols., 1891); _Le\r\nConjuration de Catilina_ (1905); _Tacite_ (1903, Eng. trans, by W.G.\r\nHutchison, 1906). He was a representative example of the French talent\r\nfor lucidity and elegance applied with entire seriousness to weighty\r\nmatters of literature. Though he devoted himself mainly to his great\r\ntheme, the reconstruction of the elements of Roman society, he also\r\nwrote monographs on _Madame de Sevigne_ (1887) and _Saint-Simon_ (1892).\r\nHe died in June 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOISSONADE DE FONTARABIE, JEAN FRANCOIS (1774-1857), French classical\r\nscholar, was born at Paris on the 12th of August 1774. In 1792 he\r\nentered the public service during the administration of General\r\nDumouriez. Driven from it in 1795, he was restored by Lucien Bonaparte,\r\nduring whose time of office he served as secretary to the prefecture of\r\nthe Upper Marne. He then definitely resigned public employment and\r\ndevoted himself to the study of Greek. In 1809 he was appointed deputy\r\nprofessor of Greek at the faculty of letters at Paris, and titular\r\nprofessor in 1813 on the death of P.H. Larcher. In 1828 he succeeded\r\nJ.B. Gail in the chair of Greek at the College de France. He also held\r\nthe offices of librarian of the Bibliotheque du Roi, and of perpetual\r\nsecretary of the Academie des Inscriptions. He died on the 8th of\r\nSeptember 1857. Boissonade chiefly devoted his attention to later Greek\r\nliterature: Philostratus, _Heroica_ (1806) and _Epistolae_ (1842);\r\nMarinus, _Vita procli_ (1814); Tiberius Rhetor, _De Figuris_ (1815);\r\nNicetas Eugenianus, _Drosilla et Charicles_ (1819); Herodian,\r\n_Partitiones_ (1819); Aristaenetus, _Epistolae_ (1822); Eunapius, _Vitae\r\nSophistarum_ (1822); Babrius, _Fables_ (1844); Tzetzes, _Allegoriae\r\nIliados_ (1851); and a _Collection of Greek Poets_ in 24 vols. The\r\n_Anecdota Graeca_ (1829-1833) and _Anecdota Nova_ (1844) are important\r\nfor Byzantine history and the Greek grammarians.\r\n\r\n  A selection of his papers was published by F. Colincamp, _Critique\r\n  litteraire sous le premier Empire_ (1863), vol. i. of which contains a\r\n  complete list of his works, and a \"Notice Historique sur Monsieur B.,\"\r\n  by Naudet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOISSY D'ANGLAS, FRANCOIS ANTOINE DE (1756-1828), French statesman,\r\nreceived a careful education and busied himself at first with\r\nliterature. He had been a member of several provincial academies before\r\ncoming to Paris, where he purchased a position as advocate to the\r\nparlement. In 1789 he was elected by the third estate of the\r\n_senechaussee_ of Annonay as deputy to the states-general. He was one of\r\nthose who induced the states-general to proclaim itself a National\r\nAssembly on the 17th of June 1789; approved, in several speeches, of the\r\ncapture of the Bastille and of the taking of the royal family to Paris\r\n(October 1789); demanded that strict measures be taken against the\r\nroyalists who were intriguing in the south of France, and published some\r\npamphlets on finance. During the Legislative Assembly he was\r\n_procureur-syndic_ for the directory of the department of Ardeche.\r\nElected to the Convention, he sat in the centre, \"_le Marais_,\" voting\r\nin the trial of Louis XVI. for his detention until deportation should be\r\njudged expedient for the state. He was then sent on a mission to Lyons\r\nto investigate the frauds in connexion with the supplies of the army of\r\nthe Alps. During the Terror he was one of those deputies of the centre\r\nwho supported Robespierre; but he was gained over by the members of the\r\nMountain hostile to Robespierre, and his support, along with that of\r\nsome other leaders of the _Marais_, made possible the 9th Thermidor. He\r\nwas then elected a member of the Committee of Public Safety and charged\r\nwith the superintendence of the provisioning of Paris. He presented the\r\nreport supporting the decree of the 3rd Ventose of the year III. which\r\nestablished liberty of worship. In the critical days of Germinal and of\r\nPrairial of the year III. he showed great courage. On the 12th Germinal\r\nhe was in the tribune, reading a report on the food supplies, when the\r\nhall of the Convention was invaded by the rioters, and when they\r\nwithdrew he quietly continued where he had been interrupted. On the 1st\r\nPrairial he presided over the Convention, and remained unmoved by the\r\ninsults and menaces of the insurgents. When the head of the deputy, Jean\r\nFeraud, was presented to him on the end of a pike, he saluted it\r\nimpassively. He was reporter of the committee which drew up the\r\nconstitution of the year III., and his report shows keen apprehension of\r\na return of the Reign of Terror, and presents reactionary measures as\r\nprecautions against the re-establishment of \"tyranny and anarchy.\" This\r\nreport, the proposal that he made (August 27, 1795) to lessen the\r\nseverity of the revolutionary laws, and the eulogies he received from\r\nseveral Paris sections suspected of disloyalty to the republic, resulted\r\nin his being obliged to justify himself (October 15, 1795). As a member\r\nof the Council of the Five Hundred he became more and more suspected of\r\nroyalism. He presented a measure in favour of full liberty for the\r\npress, which at that time was almost unanimously reactionary, protested\r\nagainst the outlawry of returned _emigres_, spoke in favour of the\r\ndeported priests and attacked the Directory. Accordingly he was\r\nproscribed on the 18th Fructidor, and lived in England until the\r\nConsulate. In 1801 he was made a member of the Tribunate, and in 1805 a\r\nsenator. In 1814 he voted for Napoleon's abdication, which won for him a\r\nseat in the chamber of peers; but during the Hundred Days he served\r\nNapoleon, and in consequence, on the second Restoration, was for a short\r\nwhile excluded. In the chamber he still sought to obtain liberty for the\r\npress--a theme upon which he published a volume of his speeches (Paris,\r\n1817). He was a member of the Institute from its foundation, and in\r\n1816, at the reorganization, became a member of the Academie des\r\nInscriptions et Belles-Lettres. He published in 1819-1821 a two-volume\r\n_Essai sur la vie et les opinions de M. de Malesherbes_.\r\n\r\n  See F.A.

A.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOITO, ARRIGO (1842-   ), Italian poet and musical composer, was born at\r\nPadua on the 24th of February 1842. He studied music at the Milan\r\nConservatoire, but even in those early days he devoted as much of his\r\ntime to literature as to music, forecasting the divided allegiance which\r\nwas to be the chief characteristic of his life's history. While at the\r\nConservatoire he wrote and composed, in collaboration with Franco\r\nFaccio, a cantata, _Le Sorelle d'Italia_, which was performed with\r\nsuccess. On completing his studies Boito travelled for some years, and\r\nafter his return to Italy settled down in Milan, dividing his time\r\nbetween journalism and music. In 1866 he fought under Garibaldi, and in\r\n1868 conducted the first performance of his opera _Mefistofele_ at the\r\nScala theatre, Milan. The work failed completely, and was withdrawn\r\nafter a second performance. It was revived in 1875 at Bologna in a much\r\naltered and abbreviated form, when its success was beyond question. It\r\nwas performed in London in 1880 with success, but in spite of frequent\r\nrevivals has never succeeded in firmly establishing itself in popular\r\nfavour. Boito treated the Faust legend in a spirit far more nearly akin\r\nto the conception of Goethe than is found in Gounod's Faust, but, in\r\nspite of many isolated beauties, his opera lacks cohesion and dramatic\r\ninterest. His energies were afterwards chiefly devoted to the\r\ncomposition of libretti, of which the principal are _Otello_ and\r\n_Falstaff_, set to music by Verdi; _La Gioconda_, set by Ponchielli;\r\n_Amleto_, set by Faccio; and _Ero e Leandre_, set by Bottesini and\r\nMancinelli. These works display a rare knowledge of the requirements of\r\ndramatic poetry, together with uncommon literary value. Boito also\r\npublished a book of poems and a novel, _L'Alfier Meno_. The degree of\r\ndoctor of music was conferred upon him in 1893 by the university of\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOIVIN, FRANCOIS DE, Baron de Villars (d. 1618), French chronicler,\r\nentered the service of Charles, Marshal Brissac, as secretary, and\r\naccompanied him to Piedmont in 1550 when the marshal went to take\r\ncommand of the French troops in the war with Spain. Remaining in this\r\nservice he was sent after the defeat of the French at St Quentin in 1557\r\nto assure the French king Henry II. of the support of Brissac. He took\r\npart in the negotiations which led to the treaty of Cateau-Cambresis in\r\nApril 1559, but was unable to prevent Henry II. from ceding the\r\nconquests made by Brissac. Boivin wrote _Memoires sur les guerres\r\ndemelees tant dans le Piemont qu'au Montferrat et duche de Milan par\r\nCharles de Cosse, comte de Brissac_ (Paris, 1607), which, in spite of\r\nsome drawbacks, is valuable as the testimony of an eye-witness of the\r\nwar. An edition, carefully revised, appears in the _Memoires relatifs a\r\nl'histoire de France_, tome x., edited by J.F. Michaud and J.J.F.\r\nPoujoulat (Paris, 1850). He also wrote _Instruction sur les affaires\r\nd'etat_ (Lyons, 1610).\r\n\r\n  See J. Lelong, _Bibliotheque historique de la France_ (Paris,\r\n  1768-1778).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOKENAM, OSBERN (1393?-1447?), English author, was born, by his own\r\naccount, on the 6th of October 1393. Dr Horstmann suggests that he may\r\nhave been a native of Bokeham, now Bookham, in Surrey, and derived his\r\nname from the place. In a concluding note to his _Lives of the Saints_\r\nhe is described as \"a Suffolke man, frere Austyn of Stoke Clare.\" He\r\ntravelled in Italy on at least two occasions, and in 1445 was a pilgrim\r\nto Santiago de Compostela. He wrote a series of thirteen legends of holy\r\nmaidens and women. These are written chiefly in seven-and eight-lined\r\nstanzas, and nine of them are preceded by prologues. Bokenam was a\r\nfollower of Chaucer and Lydgate, and doubtless had in mind Chaucer's\r\n_Legend of Good Women_. His chief, but by no means his only, source was\r\nthe _Legenda Aurea_ of Jacobus de Voragine, archbishop of Genoa, whom he\r\ncites as \"Januence.\" The first of the legends, _Vita Scae Margaretae,\r\nvirginis et martiris_, was written for his friend, Thomas Burgh, a\r\nCambridge monk; others are dedicated to pious ladies who desired the\r\nhistory of their name-saints. The Arundel MS. 327 (British Museum) is a\r\nunique copy of Bokenam's work; it was finished, according to the\r\nconcluding note, in 1447, and presented by the scribe, Thomas Burgh, to\r\na convent unnamed \"that the nuns may remember him and his sister, Dame\r\nBetrice Burgh.\" The poems were edited (1835) for the Roxburghe Club with\r\nthe title _Lyvys of Seyntys_ ..., and by Dr Carl Horstmann as _Osbern\r\nBokenams Legenden_ (Heilbronn, 1883), in E. Kolbing's _Altengl.\r\nBibliothek_, vol. i. Both editions include a dialogue written in Latin\r\nand English taken from Dugdale's _Monasticon Anglicanum_ (ed. 1846, vol.\r\nvi. p. 1600); \"this dialogue betwixt a Secular asking and a Frere\r\nanswerynge at the grave of Dame Johan of Acres shewith the lyneal\r\ndescent of the lordis of the honoure of Clare fro ... MCCXLVIII to ...\r\nMCCCLVI\". Bokenam wrote, as he tells us, plainly, in the Suffolk speech.\r\nHe explains his lack of decoration on the plea that the finest flowers\r\nhad been already plucked by Chaucer, Gower and Lydgate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOKHARA, or BUKHARA (the common central Asian pronunciation is Bukhara),\r\na state of central Asia, under the protection of Russia. It lies on the\r\nright bank of the middle Oxus, between 37 deg. and 41 deg. N., and\r\nbetween 62 deg. and 72 deg. E., and is bounded by the Russian\r\ngovernments of Syr-darya, Samarkand and Ferghana on the N., the Pamirs\r\non the E., Afghanistan on the S., and the Transcaspian territory and\r\nKhiva on the W. Its south-eastern frontier on the Pamirs is undetermined\r\nexcept where it touches the Russian dominions. Including the khanates of\r\nKarateghin and Darvaz the area is about 85,000 sq. m. The western\r\nportion of the state is a plain watered by the Zarafshan and by\r\ncountless irrigation canals drawn from it. It has in the east the\r\nKarnap-chul steppe, covered with grass in early summer, and in the north\r\nan intrusion of the Kara-kum sand desert. Land suitable for cultivation\r\nis found only in oases, where it is watered by irrigation canals, but\r\nthese oases are very fertile. The middle portion of the state is\r\noccupied by high plateaus, about 4000 ft. in altitude, sloping from the\r\nTian-shan, and intersected by numerous rivers, flowing towards the Oxus.\r\nThis region, very fertile in the valleys and enjoying a cooler and\r\ndamper climate than the lower plains, is densely populated, and\r\nagriculture and cattle-breeding are carried on extensively. Here are the\r\ntowns of Karshi, Kitab, Shaar, Chirakchi and Guzar or Huzar. The Hissar\r\nrange, a westward continuation of the Alai Mountains, separates the\r\nZarafshan from the tributaries of the Oxus--the Surkhan, Kafirnihan and\r\nVakhsh. Its length is about 200 m., and its passes, 1000 to 3000 ft.\r\nbelow the surrounding peaks, reach altitudes of 12,000 to 14,000 ft. and\r\nare extremely difficult. Numbers of rivers pierce or flow in wild gorges\r\nbetween its spurs. Its southern foot-hills, covered with loess, make the\r\nfertile valleys of Hissar and the Vakhsh. The climate is so dry, and the\r\nrains are so scarce, that an absence of forests and Alpine meadows is\r\ncharacteristic of the ridge; but when heavy rain falls simultaneously\r\nwith the melting of the snows in the mountains, the watercourses become\r\nfilled with furious torrents, which create great havoc. The main\r\nglaciers (12) are on the north slope, but none creeps below 10,000 to\r\n12,000 ft. The Peter the Great range, or Periokh-tau, in Karateghin,\r\nsouth of the valley of the Vakhsh, runs west-south-west to\r\neast-north-east for about 130 m., and is higher than the Hissar range.\r\nFrom the meridian of Garm or Harm it rises above the snowline, attaining\r\nat least 18,000 ft. in the Sary-kaudal peak, and 20,000 ft. farther east\r\nwhere it joins the snow-clad Darvaz range, and where the group Sandal,\r\nadorned with several glaciers, rises to 24,000 or 25,000 ft. Only three\r\npasses, very difficult, are known across it.\r\n\r\nDarvaz, a small vassal state of Bokhara, is situated on the Panj, where\r\nit makes its sharp bend westwards, and is emphatically a mountainous\r\nregion, agriculture being possible only in the lower parts of the\r\nvalleys. The population, about 35,000, consists chiefly of Moslem\r\nTajiks, and the closely-related Galchas, and its chief town is\r\nKala-i-khumb on the Panj, at an altitude of 4370 ft.\r\n\r\nThe chief river of Bokhara is the Oxus or Amu-darya, which separates it\r\nfrom Afghanistan on the south, and then flows along its south-west\r\nborder. It is navigated from the mouth of the Surkhan, and steamboats\r\nply on it up to Karki near the Afghan frontier. The next largest river,\r\nthe Zarafshan, 660 m. long, the water of which is largely utilized for\r\nirrigation, is lost in the sands 20 m. before reaching the Oxus. The\r\nKashka-darya, which flows westwards out of the glaciers of Hazret-sultan\r\n(west of the Hissar range), supplies the Shahri-sabs (properly\r\nShaar-sabiz) oasis with water, but is lost in the desert to the west of\r\nKarshi.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Bokhara is extreme. In the lowlands a very hot summer is\r\nfollowed by a short but cold winter, during which a frost of -20 deg.\r\nFahr. may set in, and the Oxus may freeze for a fortnight. In the\r\nhighlands this hot and dry summer is followed by four months of winter;\r\nand, finally, in the regions above 8000 ft. there is a great development\r\nof snowfields and glaciers, the passes are buried under snow, and the\r\nshort summer is rainy. The lowlands are sometimes visited by terrible\r\nsand-storms from the west, which exhaust men and kill the cotton trees.\r\nMalaria is widely prevalent, and in some years, after a wet spring,\r\nassumes a malignant character.\r\n\r\nThe population is estimated at 1,250,000. The dominant race is the\r\nUzbegs, who are fanatical Moslem Sunnites, scorn work, despise their\r\nIranian subjects, and maintain their old division into tribes or clans.\r\nThe nomad Turkomans and the nomad Kirghiz are also of Turkish origin;\r\nwhile the Sarts, who constitute the bulk of the population in the towns,\r\nare a mixture of Turks with Iranians. The great bulk of the population\r\nin the country is composed of Iranian Tajiks, who differ but very little\r\nfrom Sarts. Besides these there are Afghans, Persians, Jews, Arabs and\r\nArmenians. Much of the trade is in the hands of a colony of Hindus from\r\nShikarpur. Nearly 20% of the population are nomads and about 15%\r\nsemi-nomads.\r\n\r\nOn the irrigated lowlands rice, wheat and other cereals are cultivated,\r\nand exported to the highlands. Cotton is widely grown and exported. Silk\r\nis largely produced, and tobacco, wine, flax, hemp and fruits are\r\ncultivated. Cattle-breeding is vigorously prosecuted in Hissar and the\r\nhighlands generally. Cotton, silks, woollen cloth, and felt are\r\nmanufactured, also boots, saddles, cutlery and weapons, pottery and\r\nvarious oils. Salt, as also some iron and copper, and small quantities\r\nof gold are extracted. Trade has been greatly promoted by the building\r\nof the Transcaspian railway across the country (from Charjui on the Oxus\r\nto Kati-kurgan) in 1886-1888. The exports to Russia consist of raw\r\ncotton and silk, lamb-skins, fruits and carpets, and the imports of\r\nmanufactured goods and sugar. The imports from India are cottons, tea,\r\nshawls and indigo. There are very few roads; goods are transported on\r\ncamels, or on horses and donkeys in the hilly tracts.\r\n\r\nBokhara has for ages been looked upon as the centre of Mussulman\r\nerudition in central Asia. About one-fourth of the population is said\r\nto be able to read and write. The primary schools are numerous in the\r\ncapital, as well as in the other cities, and even exist in villages, and\r\n_madrasas_ or theological seminaries for higher courses of study are\r\ncomparatively plentiful. The _mullahs_ or priests enjoy very great\r\ninfluence, but the people are very superstitious, believing in\r\nwitchcraft, omens, spirits and the evil eye. Women occupy a low position\r\nin the social scale, though slavery has been abolished at the instance\r\nof Russia. The emir of Bokhara is an autocratic ruler, his power being\r\nlimited only by the traditional custom (_sheriat_) of the Mussulmans. He\r\nmaintains an army of some 11,000 men, but is subject to Russian control,\r\nbeing in fact a vassal of that empire.\r\n\r\n_History._--Bokhara was known to the ancients under the name of\r\nSogdiana. It was too far removed to the east ever to be brought under\r\nthe dominion of Rome, but it has shared deeply in all the various and\r\nbloody revolutions of Asia. The foundation of the capital is ascribed to\r\nEfrasiab, the great Persian hero. After the conquests of Alexander the\r\nGreat Sogdiana formed part of the empire of the Seleucidae, and shared\r\nthe fortunes of the rather better-known Bactria. Somewhat later the\r\nnomad Yue-chi began to move into the valley of the Oxus from the east,\r\nand gradually became a settled territorial power in Bactria and\r\nSogdiana, and the dominions of their king, Kadphises I. (who is believed\r\nto have come to the throne about A.D. 45), extended from Bokhara to the\r\nIndus. The district, however, was reconquered by Persia under the\r\nSassanian dynasty, and we hear of Nestorian Christians at Samarkand, at\r\nany rate in the 6th century. Islam was introduced shortly after the Arab\r\nconquest of Persia (640-642) and speedily became the dominant faith. In\r\nthe early centuries of Mahommedan rule Sogdiana was one of the most\r\ncelebrated and flourishing districts of central Asia. It was called\r\nSughd, and contained the two great cities of Samarkand and Bokhara, of\r\nwhich the former was generally the seat of government, while the latter\r\nhad a high reputation as a seat of religion and learning. During the\r\nearly middle ages this legion was also known as Ma wara 'l Nahr or\r\nMa-vera-un-nahr, the meaning of which is given in the alternative\r\nclassical title of Transoxiana. Malik Shah, third of the Seljuk dynasty\r\nof Persia, passed the Oxus about the end of the 11th century, and\r\nsubdued the whole country watered by that river and the Jaxartes. In\r\n1216 Bokhara was again subdued by Mahommed Shah Khwarizm, but his\r\nconquest was wrested from him by Jenghiz Khan in 1220. The country was\r\nwasted by the fury of this savage conqueror, but recovered something of\r\nits former prosperity under Ogdai Khan, his son, whose disposition was\r\nhumane and benevolent. His posterity kept possession till 1369, when\r\nTimur or Tamerlane bore down everything before him, and established his\r\ncapital at Samarkand, which with Bokhara regained for a time its former\r\nsplendour. Babar, the fifth in descent from Timur, was originally prince\r\nof Ferghana, but conquered Samarkand and northern India, where he\r\nfounded the Mogul (Mughal) empire. His descendants ruled in the country\r\nuntil about 1500, when it was overrun by the Uzbeg Tatars, under\r\nAbulkhair or Ebulkheir Khan, the founder of the Shaibani dynasty, with\r\nwhich the history of Bokhara properly commences. The most remarkable\r\nrepresentative of this family was Abdullah Khan (1556-1598), who greatly\r\nextended the limits of his kingdom by the conquest of Badakshan, Herat\r\nand Meshhed, and increased its prosperity by the public works which he\r\nauthorized. Before the close of the century, however, the dynasty was\r\nextinct, and Bokhara was at once desolated by a Kirghiz invasion and\r\ndistracted by a disputed succession. At length, in 1598, Baki Mehemet\r\nKhan, of the Astrakhan branch of the Timur family, mounted the throne,\r\nand thus introduced the dynasty of the Ashtarkhanides. The principal\r\nevent of his reign was the defeat he inflicted on Shah Abbas of Persia\r\nin the neighbourhood of Balkh. His brother Vali Mehemet, who succeeded\r\nin 1605, soon alienated his subjects, and was supplanted by his nephew\r\nImamkuli. After a highly prosperous reign this prince resigned in favour\r\nof his brother, Nazr Mehemet, under whom the country was greatly\r\ntroubled by the rebellion of his sons, who continued to quarrel with\r\neach other after their father's death. Meanwhile the district of Khiva,\r\npreviously subject to Bokhara, was made an independent khanate by\r\nAbdul-Gazi Bahadur Khan; and in the reign of Subhankuli, who ascended\r\nthe throne in 1680, the political power of Bokhara was still further\r\nlessened, though it continued to enjoy the unbounded respect of the\r\nSunnite Mahommedans. Subhankuli died in 1702, and a war of succession\r\nbroke out between his two sons, who were supported by the rivalry of two\r\nUzbeg tribes. After five years the contest terminated in favour of\r\nObeidullah, who was little better than a puppet in the hands of Rehim Bi\r\nAtalik, his vizier. The invasion of Nadir Shah of Persia came to\r\ncomplete the degradation of the land; and in 1740 the feeble king, Abu\r\n'l-Faiz, paid homage to the conqueror, and was soon after murdered and\r\nsupplanted by his vizier. The time of the Ashtarkhanides had been for\r\nthe most part a time of dissolution and decay; fanaticism and imbecility\r\nwent hand in hand. On its fall (1785) the throne was seized by the\r\nManghit family in the person of Mir Ma'sum, who pretended to the most\r\nextravagant sanctity, and proved by his military career that he had no\r\nsmall amount of ability. He turned his attention to the encroachments of\r\nthe Afghans, and in 1781 reconquered the greater part of what had been\r\nlost to the south of the Oxus. Dying in 1802 he was succeeded by Said,\r\nwho in bigotry and fanaticism was a true son of his father. In 1826\r\nNasrullah mounted the throne, and began with the murder of his brother a\r\nreign of continued oppression and cruelty. Meanwhile Bokhara became an\r\nobject of rivalry to Russia and England, and envoys were sent by both\r\nnations to cultivate the favour of the emir, who treated the Russians\r\nwith arrogance and the English with contempt. Two emissaries of the\r\nBritish government, Colonel C. Stoddart and Captain A. Conolly, were\r\nthrown by Nasrullah into prison, where they were put to death in 1842.\r\nIn 1862-1864 Arminius Vambery made in the disguise of a dervish a\r\nmemorable journey through this fanatical state. At this time the Russian\r\narmies were gradually advancing, and at last they appeared in Khokand;\r\nbut the new emir, Mozaffer-eddin, instead of attempting to expiate the\r\ninsults of his predecessor, sent a letter to General M.G. Chernayev\r\nsummoning him to evacuate the country, and threatening to raise all the\r\nfaithful against him. In 1866 the Russians invaded the territory of\r\nBokhara proper, and a decisive battle was fought on the 20th of May at\r\nIrdjar on the left bank of the Jaxartes. The Bokharians were defeated;\r\nbut after a period of reluctant peace they forced the emir to renew the\r\nwar. In 1868 the Russians entered Samarkand (May 14), and the emir was\r\nconstrained to submit to the terms of the conqueror, becoming\r\nhenceforward only a Russian puppet.\r\n\r\n  See Khanikov's _Bokhara_, translated by De Bode (1845); Vambery,\r\n  _Travels in Central Asia_ (1864), _Sketches of Central Asia_ (1868),\r\n  and _History of Bokhara_ (1873); Fedchenko's \"Sketch of the Zarafshan\r\n  Valley\" in _Journ. R. Geogr. Soc._ (1870); Hellwald, _Die Russen in\r\n  Central Asien_ (1873); Lipsky, _Upper Bukhara_, in Russian (1902);\r\n  Skrine and Ross, _The Heart of Asia_ (1899); Lord Ronaldshay,\r\n  _Outskirts of Empire in Asia_ (1904); and Le Strange, _The Lands of\r\n  the Eastern Caliphate_ (1905).     (P. A. K.; C. El.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOKHARA (Bokkara-i-Sherif), capital of the state of Bokhara, on the left\r\nbank of the Zarafshan, and on the irrigation canal of Shahri-rud,\r\nsituated in a fertile plain. It is 8 m. from the Bokhara station of the\r\nTranscaspian railway, 162 m. by rail W. of Samarkand, in 39 deg. 47' N.\r\nlat. and 64 deg. 27' E. long. The city is surrounded by a stone wall 28\r\nft. high and 8 m. long, with semicircular towers and eleven gates of\r\nlittle value as a defence. The present city was begun in A.D. 830 on the\r\nsite of an older city, was destroyed by Jenghiz Khan in 1220, and\r\nrebuilt subsequently. The water-supply is very unhealthy. The city has\r\nno less than 360 mosques. Nearly 10,000 pupils are said to receive their\r\neducation in its 140 _madrasas_ or theological colleges; primary schools\r\nare kept at most mosques. Some of these buildings exhibit very fine\r\narchitecture. The most notable of the mosques is the Mir-Arab, built in\r\nthe 16th century, with its beautiful lecture halls; the chief mosque of\r\nthe emir is the Mejid-kalyan, or Kok-humbez, close by which stands a\r\nbrick minaret, 203 ft. high, from the top of which state criminals used\r\nto be thrown until 1871. Of the numerous squares the Raghistan is the\r\nprincipal. It has on one side the citadel, erected on an artificially\r\nmade eminence 45 ft. high, surrounded by a wall 1 m. long, and\r\ncontaining the palace of the emir, the houses of the chief\r\nfunctionaries, the prison and the water-cisterns. The houses are mostly\r\none-storeyed, built of unburned bricks, and have flat roofs.\r\n\r\nBokhara has for ages been a centre of learning and religious life. The\r\nmysticism which took hold on Persia in the middle ages spread also to\r\nBokhara, and later, when the Mongol invasions of the 13th century laid\r\nwaste Samarkand and other Moslem cities, Bokhara, remaining independent,\r\ncontinued to be a chief seat of Islamitic learning. The _madrasa_\r\nlibraries, some of which were very rich, have been scattered and lost,\r\nor confiscated by the emirs, or have perished in conflagrations. But\r\nthere are still treasures of literature concealed in private libraries,\r\nand Afghan, Persian, Armenian and Turkish bibliophiles still repair to\r\nBokhara to buy rare books. Bokhara is, in fact, the principal\r\nbook-market of central Asia. The population is supposed by Russian\r\ntravellers not to exceed 50,000 or 60,000, but is otherwise estimated at\r\n75,000 to 100,000. Amongst them is a large and ancient colony of Jews.\r\nBokhara is the most important trading town in central Asia. In the city\r\nbazaars are made or sold silk stuffs, metal (especially copper) wares,\r\nKara-kul (i.e. astrakhan) lamb-skins and carpets.\r\n\r\n_New Bokhara_, or _Kagan_, a Russian town near the railway station, 8 m.\r\nfrom Bokhara itself, is rapidly growing, on a territory ceded by the\r\nemir. Pop. 2000.     (P. A. K.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOKSBURG, a town of the Transvaal; 14 m. E. of Johannesburg by rail.\r\nPop. of the municipality (1904) 14,757, of whom 4175 were whites. It is\r\nthe headquarters of the Witwatersrand coal mining industry. The\r\ncollieries extend from Boksburg eastward to Springs, 11 m. distant.\r\nBrakpan, the largest colliery in South Africa, lies midway between the\r\nplaces named.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLAN PASS, an important pass on the Baluch frontier, connecting\r\nJacobabad and Sibi with Quetta, which has always occupied an important\r\nplace in the history of British campaigns in Afghanistan. Since the\r\ntreaty of Gandamak, which was signed at the close of the first phase of\r\nthe Afghan War in 1879, the Bolan route has been brought directly under\r\nBritish control, and it was selected for the first alignment of the\r\nSind-Pishin railway from the plains to the plateau. From Sibi the line\r\nruns south-west, skirting the hills to Rindli, and originally followed\r\nthe course of the Bolan stream to its head on the plateau. The\r\ndestructive action of floods, however, led to the abandonment of this\r\nalignment, and the railway now follows the Mashkaf valley (which\r\ndebouches into the plains close to Sibi), and is carried from near the\r\nhead of the Mashkaf to a junction with the Bolan at Mach. An alternative\r\nroute from Sibi to Quetta was found in the Harnai valley to the N.E. of\r\nSibi, the line starting in exactly the opposite direction to that of the\r\nBolan and entering the hills at Nari. The Harnai route, although longer,\r\nis the one adopted for all ordinary traffic, the Bolan loop being\r\nreserved for emergencies. At the Khundilani gorge of the Bolan route\r\nconglomerate cliffs enclose the valley rising to a height of 800 ft.,\r\nand at Sir-i-Bolan the passage between the limestone rocks hardly admits\r\nof three persons riding abreast. The temperature of the pass in summer\r\nis very high, whereas in winter, near its head, the cold is extreme, and\r\nthe ice-cold wind rushing down the narrow outlet becomes destructive to\r\nlife. Since 1877, when the Quetta agency was founded, the freedom of the\r\npass from plundering bands of Baluch marauders (chiefly Marris) has been\r\nsecured, and it is now as safe as any pass in Scotland. (T. H. H.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLAS (plural of Span, _bola_, ball), a South American Indian weapon of\r\nwar and the chase, consisting of balls of stone attached to the ends of\r\na rope of twisted or braided hide or hemp. Charles Darwin thus describes\r\nthem in his _Voyage of the Beagle_: \"The _bolas_, or balls, are of two\r\nkinds: the simplest, which is used chiefly for catching ostriches,\r\nconsists of two round stones, covered with leather, and united by a\r\nthin, plaited thong, about 8 ft. long. The other kind differs only in\r\nhaving three balls united by thongs to a common centre. The Gaucho\r\n(native of Spanish descent) holds the smallest of the three in his\r\nhand, and whirls the other two around his head; then, taking aim, sends\r\nthem like chain shot revolving through the air. The balls no sooner\r\nstrike any object, than, winding round it, they cross each other and\r\nbecome firmly hitched.\" Bolas have been used for centuries in the South\r\nAmerican pampas and even the forest regions of the Rio Grande. F. Ratzel\r\n(_History of Mankind_) supposes them to be a form of lasso. The Eskimos\r\nuse a somewhat similar weapon to kill birds. _Bolas perdidas_ (i.e.\r\nlost) are stones attached to a very short thong, or, in some cases,\r\nhaving none at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLBEC, a town of northern France, in the department of\r\nSeine-Inferieure, on the Bolbec, 19 m. E.N.E. of Havre by rail. Pop.\r\n(1906) 10,959. Bolbec is important for its cotton spinning and weaving,\r\nand carries on the dyeing and printing of the fabric, and the\r\nmanufacture of sugar. There are a chamber of commerce and a board of\r\ntrade-arbitration. The town was enthusiastic in the cause of the\r\nReformed Religion in the 16th century, and still contains many\r\nProtestants. It was burned almost to the ground in 1765.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLE (Gr. [Greek: bolos], \"a clod of earth\"), a clay-like substance of\r\nred, brown or yellow colour, consisting essentially of hydrous aluminium\r\nsilicate, with more or less iron. Most bole differs from ordinary clay\r\nin not being plastic, but in dropping to pieces when placed in water,\r\nthus behaving rather like fuller's-earth. Bole was formerly in great\r\nrepute medicinally, the most famous kind being the Lemnian Earth\r\n([Greek: gae Laemnia]), from the Isle of Lemnos in the Greek\r\nArchipelago. The earth was dug with much ceremony only once a year, and\r\nhaving been mixed with goats' blood was made into little cakes or balls,\r\nwhich were stamped by the priests, whence they became known as _Terra\r\nsigillata_ (\"sealed earth\"). Large quantities of bole occur as red\r\npartings between the successive lava flows of the Tertiary volcanic\r\nseries in the north of Ireland and the west of Scotland. Here it seems\r\nto have resulted from the decomposition of the basalt and kindred rocks\r\nby meteoric agencies, during periods of volcanic repose. In Antrim the\r\nbole is associated with lithomarge, bauxite and pisolitic iron-ore. Bole\r\noccurs in like manner between the great sheets of the Deccan traps in\r\nIndia; and a similar substance is also found interbedded with some of\r\nthe doleritic lavas of Etna.\r\n\r\nIn the sense of stem or trunk of a tree, \"bole\" is from the O. Norwegian\r\n_bolr_, of. Ger. _Bohle_, plank. It is probably connected with the large\r\nnumber of words, such as \"boll,\" \"ball,\" \"bowl,\" &c., which stand for a\r\nround object.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLESLAUS I., called \"The Great,\" king of Poland (d. 1025), was the son\r\nof Mieszko, first Christian prince of Poland, and the Bohemian princess\r\nDobrawa, or Bona, whose chaplain, Jordan, converted the court from\r\npaganism to Catholicism. He succeeded his father in 992. A born warrior,\r\nhe speedily raised the little struggling Polish principality on the\r\nVistula to the rank of a great power. In 996 he gained a seaboard by\r\nseizing Pomerania, and subsequently took advantage of the troubles in\r\nBohemia to occupy Cracow, previously a Czech city. Like his\r\ncontemporaries, Stephen of Hungary and Canute of Denmark, Boleslaus\r\nrecognized from the first the essential superiority of Christianity over\r\nevery other form of religion, and he deserves with them the name of\r\n\"Great\" because he deliberately associated himself with the new faith.\r\nThus despite an inordinate love of adventure, which makes him appear\r\nrather a wandering chieftain than an established ruler, he was\r\nessentially a man of insight and progress. He showed great sagacity in\r\nreceiving the fugitive Adalbert, bishop of Prague, and when the saint\r\nsuffered martyrdom at the hands of the pagan Slavs (April 23, 997),\r\nBoleslaus purchased his relics and solemnly laid them in the church of\r\nGnesen, founded by his father, which now became the metropolitan see of\r\nPoland. It was at Gnesen that Boleslaus in the year 1000 entertained\r\nOtto III. so magnificently that the emperor, declaring such a man too\r\nworthy to be merely _princeps_, conferred upon him the royal crown,\r\nthough twenty-five years later, in the last year of his life, Boleslaus\r\nthought it necessary to crown himself king a second time. On the death\r\nof Otto, Boleslaus invaded Germany, penetrated to the Elbe, occupying\r\nStralsund and Meissen on his way, and extended his dominions to the\r\nElster and the Saale. He also occupied Bohemia, till driven out by the\r\nemperor Henry IV. in 1004. The German war was terminated in 1018 by the\r\npeace of Bautzen, greatly to the advantage of Boleslaus, who retained\r\nLusatia. He then turned his arms against Jaroslav, grand duke of Kiev,\r\nwhom he routed on the banks of the Bug, then the boundary between Russia\r\nand Poland. For ten months Boleslaus remained at Kiev, whence he\r\naddressed triumphant letters to the emperors of the East and West. At\r\nhis death in 1025 he left Poland one of the mightiest states of Europe,\r\nextending from the Bug to the Elbe, and from the Baltic to the Danube,\r\nand possessing besides the overlordship of Russia. But his greatest\r\nachievement was the establishment in Poland of a native church, the\r\nfirst step towards political independence.\r\n\r\n  See J.N. Pawlowski, _St Adalbert_ (Danzig, 1860); _Chronica Nestoris_\r\n  (Vienna, 1860); Heinrich R. von Zeissberg, _Die Kriege Kaiser\r\n  Heinrichs II. mit Herzog Boleslaw I._ (Vienna, 1868).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLESLAUS II., called \"The Bold,\" king of Poland (1039-1081), eldest son\r\nof Casimir I., succeeded his father in 1058. The domestic order and\r\ntranquillity of the kingdom had been restored by his painstaking father,\r\nbut Poland had shrunk territorially since the age of his grandfather\r\nBoleslaus I., and it was the aim of Boleslaus II. to restore her dignity\r\nand importance. The nearest enemy was Bohemia, to whom Poland had lately\r\nbeen compelled to pay tribute for her oldest possession, Silesia. But\r\nBoleslaus's first Bohemian war proved unsuccessful, and was terminated\r\nby the marriage of his sister Swatawa with the Czech king Wratyslaus II.\r\nOn the other hand Boleslaus's ally, the fugitive Magyar prince Bela,\r\nsucceeded with Polish assistance in winning the crown of Hungary. In the\r\nEast Boleslaus was more successful. In 1069 he succeeded in placing\r\nIzaslaus on the throne of Kiev, thereby confirming Poland's overlordship\r\nover Russia and enabling Boleslaus to chastise his other enemies,\r\nBohemia among them, with the co-operation of his Russian auxiliaries.\r\nBut Wratyslaus of Bohemia speedily appealed to the emperor for help, and\r\na war between Poland and the Empire was only prevented by the sudden\r\nrupture of Henry IV. with the Holy See and the momentous events which\r\nled to the humiliating surrender of the emperor at Canossa. There is\r\nnothing to show that Boleslaus took any part in this struggle, though at\r\nthis time he was on the best of terms with Gregory VII. and there was\r\nsome talk of sending papal legates to restore order in the Polish\r\nChurch. On the 26th of December 1076 Boleslaus encircled his own brows\r\nwith the royal diadem, a striking proof that the Polish kings did not\r\neven yet consider their title quite secure. A second successful\r\nexpedition to Kiev to reinstate his _protege_ Izaslaus, is Boleslaus's\r\nlast recorded exploit. Almost immediately afterwards (1079) we find him\r\nan exile in Hungary, where he died about 1081. The cause of this sudden\r\neclipse was the cruel vengeance he took on the _milites_, or noble\r\norder, who, emulating the example of their brethren in Bohemia, were\r\nalready attempting to curb the royal power. The churchmen headed by\r\nStanislaus Szczepanowski, bishop of Cracow, took the side of the nobles,\r\nwhose grievances seem to have been real. Boleslaus in his fury slew the\r\nsaintly bishop, but so general was the popular indignation that he had\r\nto fly his kingdom.\r\n\r\n  See M. Maksymilian Gumplowicz, _Zur Geschichte Polens im Mittelalter_\r\n  (Innsbruck, 1898); W.P. Augerstein, _Der Konflikt des polnischen\r\n  Konigs Boleslaw II. mit dem Bischof Stanislaus_ (Thorn, 1895).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLESLAUS III., king of Poland (1086-1139), the son of Wladislaus I. and\r\nJudith of Bohemia, was born on the 23rd of December 1086 and succeeded\r\nhis father in 1102. His earlier years were troubled continually by the\r\nintrigues of his natural half-brother Zbigniew, who till he was\r\nimprisoned and blinded involved Boleslaus in frequent contests with\r\nBohemia and the emperor Henry V. The first of the German wars began in\r\n1109, when Henry, materially assisted by the Bohemians, invaded Silesia.\r\nIt was mainly a war of sieges, Henry sitting down before Lubusz, Glogau\r\nand Breslau, all of which he failed to take. The Poles avoided an\r\nencounter in the open field, but harried the Germans so successfully\r\naround Breslau that the plain was covered with corpses, which Henry had\r\nto leave to the dogs on his disastrous retreat; hence the scene of the\r\naction was known as \"the field of dogs.\" The chief political result of\r\nthis disaster was the complete independence of Poland for the next\r\nquarter of a century. It was during this respite that Boleslaus devoted\r\nhimself to the main business of his life--the subjugation of Pomerania\r\n(i.e. the maritime province) with the view of gaining access to the sea.\r\nPomerania, protected on the south by virgin forests and almost\r\nimpenetrable morasses, was in those days inhabited by a valiant and\r\nsavage Slavonic race akin to the Wends, who clung to paganism with\r\nunconquerable obstinacy. The possession of a seaboard enabled them to\r\nmaintain fleets and build relatively large towns such as Stettin and\r\nKolberg, whilst they ravaged at will the territories of their southern\r\nneighbours the Poles. In self-defence Boleslaus was obliged to subdue\r\nthem. The struggle began in 1109, when Boleslaus inflicted a terrible\r\ndefeat on the Pomeranians at Nackel which compelled their temporary\r\nsubmission. In 1120-1124 the rebellion of his vassal Prince Warceslaus\r\nof Stettin again brought Boleslaus into the country, but the resistance\r\nwas as stout as ever, and only after 18,000 of his followers had fallen\r\nand 8000 more had been expatriated did Warceslaus submit to his\r\nconqueror. The obstinacy of the resistance convinced Boleslaus that\r\nPomerania must be christianized before it could be completely subdued;\r\nand this important work was partially accomplished by St Otto, bishop of\r\nBamberg, an old friend of Boleslaus's father, who knew the Slavonic\r\nlanguages. In 1124 the southern portions of the land were converted by\r\nSt Otto, but it was only under the threat of extermination if they\r\npersisted in their evil ways that the people of Stettin accepted the\r\nfaith in the following year. In 1128, at the council of Usedom, St Otto\r\nappointed his disciple Boniface bishop of Julin, the first Pomeranian\r\ndiocese, and the foundation of a better order of things was laid. In his\r\nlater years Boleslaus waged an unsuccessful war with Hungary and\r\nBohemia, and was forced to claim the mediation of the emperor Lothair,\r\nto whom he did homage for Pomerania and Rugen at the diet of Merseburg\r\nin 1135. He died in 1139.\r\n\r\n  See Gallus, _Chronicon_, ed.

The species all\r\ngrow on the ground, in woods or under trees, in the early autumn. They\r\nare brown, red or yellow in colour; the pores also vary in colour from\r\npure white to brown, red, yellow or green, and are from one or two lines\r\nto nearly an inch long. A few are poisonous; several are good for\r\neating. One of the greatest favourites for the table is _Boletus\r\nedulis_, recognized by its brown cap and white pores which become green\r\nwhen old. It is the _ceps_ of the continental European markets. There\r\nare forty-nine British species of _Boletus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLEYN (or BULLEN), ANNE (c. 1507-1536), queen of Henry VIII. of\r\nEngland, daughter of Sir Thomas Boleyn, afterwards earl of Wiltshire and\r\nOrmonde, and of Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Howard, earl of Surrey,\r\nafterwards duke of Norfolk, was born, according to Camden, in 1507, but\r\nher birth has been ascribed, though not conclusively, to an earlier date\r\n(to 1502 or 1501) by some later writers.[1] In 1514 she accompanied Mary\r\nTudor to France on the marriage of the princess to Louis XII., remained\r\nthere after the king's death, and became one of the women in waiting to\r\nQueen Claude, wife of Francis I. She returned in 1521 or 1522 to\r\nEngland, where she had many admirers and suitors. Among the former was\r\nthe poet Sir Thomas Wyatt,[2] and among the latter, Henry Percy, heir of\r\nthe earl of Northumberland, a marriage with whom, however, was stopped\r\nby the king and another match provided for her in the person of Sir\r\nJames Butler. Anne Boleyn, however, remained unmarried, and a series of\r\ngrants and favours bestowed by Henry on her father between 1522 and 1525\r\nhave been taken, though very doubtfully, as a symptom of the king's\r\naffections. Unlike her sister Mary, who had fallen a victim to Henry's\r\nsolicitations,[3] Anne had no intention of being the king's mistress;\r\nshe meant to be his queen, and her conduct seems to have been governed\r\nentirely by motives of ambition. The exact period of the beginning of\r\nAnne's relations with Henry is not known. They have been surmised as\r\noriginating as early as 1523; but there is nothing to prove that Henry's\r\npassion was anterior to the proceedings taken for the divorce in May\r\n1527, the celebrated love letters being undated. Her name is first\r\nopenly connected with the king's as a possible wife in the event of\r\nCatherine's divorce, in a letter of Mendoza, the imperial ambassador, to\r\nCharles V. of the 16th of August 1527,[4] during the absence in France\r\nof Wolsey, who, not blinded by passion like Henry, naturally opposed the\r\nundesirable alliance, and was negotiating a marriage with Renee,\r\ndaughter of Louis XII. Henry meanwhile, however, had sent William\r\nKnight, his secretary, on a separate mission to Rome to obtain\r\nfacilities for his marriage with Anne; and on the cardinal's return in\r\nAugust he found her installed as the king's companion and proposed\r\nsuccessor to Catherine of Aragon. After the king's final separation from\r\nhis wife in July 1531, Anne's position was still more marked, and in\r\n1532 she accompanied Henry on the visit to Francis I., while Catherine\r\nwas left at home neglected and practically a prisoner. Soon after their\r\nreturn Anne was found to be pregnant, and in consequence Henry married\r\nher about the 25th of January 1533[5] (the exact date is unknown), their\r\nunion not being made public till the following Easter. Subsequently, on\r\nthe 23rd of May, their marriage was declared valid and that with\r\nCatherine null, and in June Anne was crowned with great state in\r\nWestminster Abbey. Anne Boleyn had now reached the zenith of her hopes.\r\nA weak, giddy woman of no stability of character, her success turned her\r\nhead and caused her to behave with insolence and impropriety, in strong\r\ncontrast with Catherine's quiet dignity under her misfortunes. She, and\r\nnot the king, probably was the author of the petty persecutions\r\ninflicted upon Catherine and upon the princess Mary, and her jealousy of\r\nthe latter showed itself in spiteful malice. Mary was to be forced into\r\nthe position of a humble attendant upon Anne's infant, and her ears were\r\nto be boxed if she proved recalcitrant. She urged that both should be\r\nbrought to trial under the new statute of succession passed in 1534,\r\nwhich declared her own children the lawful heirs to the throne. She was\r\nreported as saying that when the king gave opportunity by leaving\r\nEngland, she would put Mary to death even if she were burnt or flayed\r\nalive for it.[6] She incurred the remonstrances of the privy council and\r\nalienated her own friends and relations. Her uncle, the duke of Norfolk,\r\nwhom she was reported to have treated \"worse than a dog,\" reviled her,\r\ncalling her a \"grande putaine.\" But her day of triumph was destined to\r\nbe even shorter than that of her predecessor. There were soon signs that\r\nHenry's affection, which had before been a genuine passion, had cooled\r\nor ceased. He resented her arrogance, and a few months after the\r\nmarriage he gave her cause for jealousy, and disputes arose. A strange\r\nand mysterious fate had prepared for Anne the same domestic griefs that\r\nhad vexed and ruined Catherine and caused her abandonment. In September\r\n1533 the birth of a daughter, afterwards Queen Elizabeth, instead of the\r\nlong-hoped-for son, was a heavy disappointment; next year there was a\r\nmiscarriage, and on the 29th of January 1536, the day of Catherine's\r\nfuneral, she gave birth to a dead male child.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of May following the king suddenly broke up a tournament at\r\nGreenwich, leaving the company in bewilderment and consternation. The\r\ncause was soon known. Inquiries had been made on reports of the queen's\r\nill-conduct, and several of her reputed lovers had been arrested. On the\r\n2nd Anne herself was committed to the Tower on a charge of adultery with\r\nvarious persons, including her own brother, Lord Rochford. On the 12th\r\nSir Francis Weston, Henry Norris, William Brereton and Mark Smeaton were\r\ndeclared guilty of high treason, while Anne herself and Lord Rochford\r\nwere condemned unanimously by an assembly of twenty-six peers on the\r\n15th. Her uncle, the duke of Norfolk, presided as lord steward, and gave\r\nsentence, weeping, that his niece was to be burned or beheaded as\r\npleased the king. Her former lover, the earl of Northumberland, left the\r\ncourt seized with sudden illness. Her father, who was excused\r\nattendance, had, however, been present at the trial of the other\r\noffenders, and had there declared his conviction of his daughter's\r\nguilt. On the 16th, hoping probably to save herself by these means, she\r\ninformed Cranmer of a certain supposed impediment to her marriage with\r\nthe king--according to some accounts a previous marriage with\r\nNorthumberland, though the latter solemnly and positively denied\r\nit--which was never disclosed, but which, having been considered by the\r\narchbishop and a committee of ecclesiastical lawyers, was pronounced, on\r\nthe 17th, sufficient to invalidate her marriage. The same day all her\r\nreputed lovers were executed; and on the 19th she herself suffered death\r\non Tower Green, her head being struck off with a sword by the\r\nexecutioner of Calais brought to England for the purpose.[7] She had\r\nregarded the prospect of death with courage and almost with levity,\r\nlaughing heartily as she put her hands about her \"little neck\" and\r\nrecalled the skill of the executioner. \"I have seen many men\" (wrote Sir\r\nWilliam Kingston, governor of the Tower) \"and also women executed, and\r\nall they have been in great sorrow, and to my knowledge this lady has\r\nmuch joy and pleasure in death.\" On the following day Henry was\r\nbetrothed to Jane Seymour.\r\n\r\nAmidst the vituperations of the adherents of the papacy and the later\r\nElizabethan eulogies, and in the absence of the records on which her\r\nsentence was pronounced, Anne Boleyn's guilt remains unproved. To Sir\r\nWilliam Kingston she protested her entire innocence, and on the scaffold\r\nwhile expressing her submission she made no confession.[8] Smeaton alone\r\nof her supposed lovers made a full confession, and it is possible that\r\nhis statement was drawn from him by threats of torture or hopes of\r\npardon. Norris, according to one account,[9] also confessed, but\r\nsubsequently declared that he had been betrayed into making his\r\nstatement. The others were all said to have \"confessed in a manner\" on\r\nthe scaffold, but much weight cannot be placed on these general\r\nconfessions, which were, according to the custom of the time, a\r\ndeclaration of submission to the king's will and of general repentance\r\nrather than acknowledgment of the special crime. \"I pray God save the\r\nking,\" Anne herself is reported to have said on the scaffold, \"and send\r\nhim long to reign over you, for a gentler nor a more merciful prince was\r\nthere never; and to me he was ever a good, a gentle and sovereign lord.\"\r\nA principal witness for the charge of incest was Rochford's own wife, a\r\nwoman of infamous character, afterwards executed for complicity in the\r\nintrigues of Catherine Howard. The discovery of Anne's misdeeds\r\ncoincided in an extraordinary manner with Henry's disappointment in not\r\nobtaining by her a male heir, while the king's despotic power and the\r\nuniversal unpopularity of Anne both tended to hinder the administration\r\nof pure justice. Nevertheless, though unproved, Anne's guilt is more\r\nthan probable. It is almost incredible that two grand juries, a petty\r\njury, and a tribunal consisting of nearly all the lay peers of England,\r\nwith the evidence before them which we do not now possess, should have\r\nall unanimously passed a sentence of guilt contrary to the facts and\r\ntheir convictions, and that such a sentence should have been supported\r\nby Anne's own father and uncle. Every year since her marriage Anne had\r\ngiven birth to a child, and Henry had no reason to despair of more;\r\nwhile, if Henry's state of health was such as was reported, the desire\r\nfor children, which Anne shared with him, may be urged as an argument\r\nfor her guilt. Sir Francis Weston in a letter to his family almost\r\nacknowledges his guilt in praying for pardon, especially for offences\r\nagainst his wife;[10] Anne's own conduct and character almost prepare us\r\nfor some catastrophe. Whether innocent or guilty, however, her fate\r\ncaused no regrets and her misfortunes did not raise a single champion or\r\ndefender. The sordid incidents of her rise, and the insolence with which\r\nshe used her triumph, had alienated all hearts from the unhappy woman.\r\nAmong the people she had always been intensely disliked; the love of\r\njustice, and the fear of trade losses imminent upon a breach with\r\nCharles V., combined to render her unpopular. She appealed to the king's\r\nless refined instincts, and Henry's deterioration of character may be\r\ndated from his connexion with her. She is described as \"not one of the\r\nhandsomest women in the world; she is of a middling stature, swarthy\r\ncomplexion, long neck, wide mouth, bosom not much raised, and in fact\r\nhas nothing but the English king's great appetite, and her eyes which\r\nare black and beautiful, and take great effect.\"[11] Cranmer admired\r\nher--\"sitting in her hair\" (i.e. with her hair falling over her\r\nshoulders, which seems to have been her custom on great occasions),\r\n\"upon a horse litter, richly apparelled,\" at her coronation.[12]\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--Art. in the _Dict. of Nat.

It is\r\ngenerally considered to have been the capital of the Bulgarians when\r\nthey were established in that part of Europe (5th to 15th century).\r\nRuins of the old walls and towers still survive, as well as numerous\r\n_kurgans_ or burial-mounds, with inscriptions, some in Arabic\r\n(1222-1341), others in Armenian (years 557, 984 and 986), and yet others\r\nin Turkic. Upon being opened these tombs were found to contain weapons,\r\nimplements, utensils, and silver and copper coins, bearing inscriptions,\r\nsome in ordinary Arabic, others in Kufic (a kind of epigraphic Arabic).\r\nThese and other antiquities collected here (1722) are preserved in\r\nmuseums at Kazan, Moscow and St Petersburg. The ruins, which were\r\npractically discovered in the reign of Peter the Great, were visited and\r\ndescribed by Pallas, Humboldt and others. The city of Bolgari was\r\ndestroyed by the Mongols in 1238, and again by Tamerlane early in the\r\nfollowing century, after which it served as the capital of the Khans\r\n(sovereign princes) of the Golden Horde of Mongols, and finally, in the\r\nsecond half of the 15th century it became a part of the principality of\r\nKazan, and so eventually of Russia. The Arab geographer Ibn Haukal\r\nstates that in his time, near the end of the 10th century, it was a\r\nplace of 10,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\n  See Ibn Fadhlan, _Nachrichten uber die Wolga Bulgaren_ (Ger. trans. by\r\n  Frahn, St Petersburg, 1832).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLI, the chief town of a sanjak of the Kastamuni vilayet in Asia Minor,\r\naltitude 2500 ft., situated in a rich plain watered by the Boli Su, a\r\ntributary of the Filiyas Chai (_Billaeus_). Pop. (1894) 10,796 (Moslems,\r\n9642; Greeks, 758; Armenians, 396). Cotton and leather are manufactured;\r\nthe country around is fertile, and in the neighbourhood are large\r\nforests of oak, beech, elm, chestnut and pine, the timber of which is\r\npartly used locally and partly exported to Constantinople. Three miles\r\neast of Boli, at Eskihissar, are the ruins of _Bithynium_, the\r\nbirthplace of Antinous, also called _Antinoopolis_, and in Byzantine\r\ntimes _Claudiopolis_. In and around Boli are numerous marbles with Greek\r\ninscriptions, chiefly sepulchral, and architectural fragments. At Ilija,\r\nsouth of the town, are warm springs much prized for their medicinal\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE, HENRY ST JOHN, VISCOUNT (1678-1751), English statesman and\r\nwriter, son of Sir Henry St John, Bart. (afterwards 1st Viscount St\r\nJohn, a member of a younger branch of the family of the earls of\r\nBolingbroke and barons St John of Bletso), and of Lady Mary Rich,\r\ndaughter of the 2nd earl of Warwick, was baptized on the 10th of October\r\n1678, and was educated at Eton. He travelled abroad during 1698 and 1699\r\nand acquired an exceptional knowledge of French. The dissipation and\r\nextravagance of his youth exceeded all limits and surprised his\r\ncontemporaries. He spent weeks in riotous orgies and outdrank the most\r\nexperienced drunkards. An informant of Goldsmith saw him once \"run naked\r\nthrough the park in a state of intoxication.\" Throughout his career he\r\ndesired, says Swift, his intimate friend, to be thought the Alcibiades\r\nor Petronius of his age, and to mix licentious orgies with the highest\r\npolitical responsibilities.[1] In 1700 he married Frances, daughter of\r\nSir Henry Winchcombe, Bart., of Bucklebury, Berkshire, but matrimony\r\nwhile improving his fortune did not redeem his morals.\r\n\r\nHe was returned to parliament in 1701 for the family borough of Wootton\r\nBassett in Wiltshire. He declared himself a Tory, attached himself to\r\nHarley (afterwards Lord Oxford), then speaker, whom he now addressed as\r\n\"dear master,\" and distinguished himself by his eloquence in debate,\r\neclipsing his schoolfellow, Walpole, and gaining an extraordinary\r\nascendancy over the House of Commons. In May he had charge of the bill\r\nfor securing the Protestant succession; he took part in the impeachment\r\nof the Whig lords for their conduct concerning the Partition treaties,\r\nand opposed the oath abjuring the Pretender. In March 1702 he was chosen\r\ncommissioner for taking the public accounts. After Anne's accession he\r\nsupported the bills in 1702 and 1704 against occasional conformity, and\r\ntook a leading part in the disputes which arose between the two Houses.\r\nIn 1704 St John took office with Harley as secretary at war, thus being\r\nbrought into intimate relations with Marlborough, by whom he was treated\r\nwith paternal partiality. In 1708 he quitted office with Harley on the\r\nfailure of the latter's intrigue, and retired to the country till 1710,\r\nwhen he became a privy councillor and secretary of state in Harley's new\r\nministry, representing Berkshire in parliament. He supported the bill\r\nfor requiring a real property qualification for a seat in parliament. In\r\n1711 he founded the Brothers' Club, a society of Tory politicians and\r\nmen of letters, and the same year witnessed the failure of the two\r\nexpeditions to the West Indies and to Canada promoted by him. In 1712 he\r\nwas the author of the bill taxing newspapers. But the great business of\r\nthe new government was the making of the peace with France. The refusal\r\nof the Whigs to grant terms in 1706, and again in 1709 when Louis XIV.\r\noffered to yield every point for which the allies professed to be\r\nfighting, showed that the war was not being continued for English\r\nnational interests, and the ministry were supported by the queen, the\r\nparliament and the people in their design to terminate hostilities. But\r\nvarious obstacles arose from the diversity of aims among the allies; and\r\nSt John was induced, contrary to the most solemn obligations, to enter\r\ninto separate and secret negotiations with France for the security of\r\nEnglish interests. In May 1712 St John ordered the duke of Ormonde, who\r\nhad succeeded Marlborough in the command, to refrain from any further\r\nengagement. These instructions were communicated to the French, though\r\nnot to the allies, Louis putting Dunkirk as security into possession of\r\nEngland, and the shameful spectacle was witnessed of the desertion by\r\nthe English troops of their allies almost on the battlefield.\r\nSubsequently St John received the congratulations of the French\r\nminister, Torcy, on the occasion of the French victory over Prince\r\nEugene at Denain.\r\n\r\nIn August St John, who had on the 7th of July been created Viscount\r\nBolingbroke and Baron St John of Lydiard Tregoze, went to France to\r\nconduct negotiations, and signed an armistice between England and France\r\nfor four months on the 19th. Finally the treaty of Utrecht was signed on\r\nthe 31st of March 1713 by all the allies except the emperor. The first\r\nproduction of Addison's _Cato_ was made by the Whigs the occasion of a\r\ngreat demonstration of indignation against the peace, and by Bolingbroke\r\nfor presenting the actor Booth with a purse of fifty guineas for\r\n\"defending the cause of liberty against a perpetual dictator\"\r\n(Marlborough). In the terms granted to England there was perhaps little\r\nto criticize. But the manner of the peacemaking, which had been carried\r\non by a series of underhand conspiracies with the enemy instead of by\r\nopen conferences with the allies, and was characterized throughout by a\r\nviolation of the most solemn international assurances, left a deep and\r\nlasting stain upon the national honour and credit; and not less\r\ndishonourable was the abandonment of the Catalans by the treaty. For all\r\nthis Bolingbroke must be held primarily responsible. In June his\r\ncommercial treaty with France, establishing free trade with that\r\ncountry, was rejected. Meanwhile the friendship between Bolingbroke and\r\nHarley, which formed the basis of the whole Tory administration, had\r\nbeen gradually dissolved. In March 1711, by Guiscard's attempt on his\r\nlife, Harley got the wound which had been intended for St John, with all\r\nthe credit. In May Harley obtained the earldom of Oxford and was made\r\nlord treasurer, while in July St John was greatly disappointed at\r\nreceiving only his viscountcy instead of the earldom lately extinct in\r\nhis family, and at being passed over for the Garter. In September 1713\r\nSwift came to London, and made a last but vain attempt to reconcile his\r\ntwo friends. But now a further cause of difference had arisen. The\r\nqueen's health was visibly breaking, and the Tory ministers could only\r\nlook forward to their own downfall on the accession of the elector of\r\nHanover. Both Oxford[2] and Bolingbroke had maintained for some time\r\nsecret communications with James, and promised their help in restoring\r\nhim at the queen's death. The aims of the former, prudent,\r\nprocrastinating and vacillating by nature, never extended probably\r\nbeyond the propitiation of his Tory followers; and it is difficult to\r\nimagine that Bolingbroke could have really advocated the Pretender's\r\nrecall, whose divine right he repudiated and whose religion and\r\nprinciples he despised. Nevertheless, whatever his chief motive may have\r\nbeen, whether to displace Oxford as leader of the party, to strengthen\r\nhis position and that of the faction in order to dictate terms to the\r\nfuture king, or to reinstate James, Bolingbroke, yielding to his more\r\nimpetuous and adventurous disposition, went much further than Oxford.\r\nIt is possible to suppose a connexion between his zeal for making peace\r\nwith France and a desire to forward the Pretender's interests or win\r\nsupport from the Jacobites.[3] During his diplomatic mission to France\r\nhe had incurred blame for remaining at the opera while the Pretender was\r\npresent,[4] and according to the Mackintosh transcripts he had several\r\nsecret interviews with him. Regular communications were kept up\r\nsubsequently. In March 1714 Herville, the French envoy in London, sent\r\nto Torcy, the French foreign minister in Paris, the substance of two\r\nlong conversations with Bolingbroke in which the latter advised patience\r\ntill after the accession of George, when a great reaction was to be\r\nexpected in favour of the Pretender. At the same time he spoke of the\r\ntreachery of Marlborough and Berwick, and of one other, presumably\r\nOxford, whom he refused to name, all of whom were in communication with\r\nHanover.[5] Both Oxford and Bolingbroke warned James that he could have\r\nlittle chance of success unless he changed his religion, but the\r\nlatter's refusal (March 13) does not appear to have stopped the\r\ncommunications. Bolingbroke gradually superseded Oxford in the\r\nleadership. Lady Masham, the queen's favourite, quarrelled with Oxford\r\nand identified herself with Bolingbroke's interests. The harsh treatment\r\nof the Hanoverian demands was inspired by him, and won favour with the\r\nqueen, while Oxford's influence declined; and by his support of the\r\nSchism Bill in May 1714, a violent Tory measure forbidding all education\r\nby dissenters by making an episcopal licence obligatory for\r\nschoolmasters, he probably intended to compel Oxford to give up the\r\ngame. Finally, a charge of corruption brought by Oxford in July against\r\nBolingbroke and Lady Masham, in connexion with the commercial treaty\r\nwith Spain, failed, and the lord treasurer was dismissed or retired on\r\nthe 27th of July.\r\n\r\nBolingbroke was now supreme, and everything appeared tending inevitably\r\nto a Jacobite restoration. The Jacobite Sir William Windham had been\r\nmade chancellor of the exchequer, important military posts were placed\r\nin the hands of the faction, and a new ministry of Jacobites was\r\nprojected. But now the queen's sudden death on the 1st of August, and\r\nthe appointment of Shrewsbury to the lord treasurership, instantly\r\nchanged the whole scene and ruined Bolingbroke. \"The earl of Oxford was\r\nremoved on Tuesday,\" he wrote to Swift on the 3rd of August, \"the queen\r\ndied on Sunday! What a world is this and how does fortune banter us!\"\r\nAccording to Herville, the French envoy, Bolingbroke declared to him\r\nthat in six weeks he could have secured everything. Nevertheless the\r\nexact nature of his projects remains obscure. It is probable that his\r\nstatement in his letter to Windham that \"none of us had any very settled\r\nresolution\" is true, though his declaration in the _Patriot King_ that\r\n\"there were no designs on foot ... to place the crown on the head of the\r\nPretender\" is a palpable falsehood. His great object was doubtless to\r\ngain supreme power and to keep it by any means, and by any betrayal that\r\nthe circumstances demanded; and it is not without significance perhaps\r\nthat on the very day of Oxford's dismissal he gave a dinner to the Whig\r\nleaders, and on the day preceding the queen's death ordered overtures to\r\nbe made to the elector.[6]\r\n\r\nOn the accession of George I. the illuminations and bonfire at Lord\r\nBolingbroke's house in Golden Square were \"particularly fine and\r\nremarkable,\"[7] but he was immediately dismissed from office. He retired\r\nto Bucklebury and is said to have now written the answer to the _Secret\r\nHistory of the White Staff_ accusing him of Jacobitism. In March 1715 he\r\nin vain attempted to defend the late ministry in the new parliament; and\r\non the announcement of Walpole's intended attack upon the authors of the\r\ntreaty of Utrecht he fled in disguise (March 28, 1715) to Paris, where\r\nhe was well received, after having addressed a letter to Lord Lansdowne\r\nfrom Dover protesting his innocence and challenging \"the most\r\ninveterate of his enemies to produce any instance of his criminal\r\ncorrespondence.\" Bolingbroke in July entirely identified himself with\r\nthe interests of the Pretender, whose secretary he became, and on the\r\n10th of September he was attainted. But his counsel was neglected for\r\nthat of ignorant refugees and Irish priests. The expedition of 1715 was\r\nresolved upon against his advice. He drew up James's declaration, but\r\nthe assurances he had inserted concerning the security of the Church of\r\nEngland were cancelled by the priests. He remained at Paris, and\r\nendeavoured to establish relations with the regent. On the return of\r\nJames, as the result of petty intrigues and jealousies, Bolingbroke was\r\ndismissed from his office. He now renounced all further efforts on the\r\nPretender's behalf.[8] Replying to Mary of Modena, who had sent a\r\nmessage deprecating his ill-will, he wished his arm might rot off if he\r\never used pen or sword in their service again![9]\r\n\r\nHe now turned to the English government in hopes of pardon. In March\r\n1716 he declared his final abandonment of the Pretender and promised to\r\nuse his influence to secure the withdrawal of his friends; but he\r\nrefused to betray any secrets or any individuals. He wrote his\r\n_Reflexions upon Exile_, and in 1717 his letter to Sir W. Windham in\r\nexplanation of his position, generally considered one of his finest\r\ncompositions, but not published till 1753 after his death. The same year\r\nhe formed a liaison with Marie Claire Deschamps de Marcilly, widow of\r\nthe marquis de Villette, whom he married in 1720 after the death in 1718\r\nof Lady Bolingbroke, whom he had treated with cruel neglect. He bought\r\nand resided at the estate of La Source near Orleans, studied philosophy,\r\ncriticized the chronology of the Bible, and was visited amongst others\r\nby Voltaire, who expressed unbounded admiration for his learning and\r\npoliteness. In 1723, through the medium of the king's mistress, the\r\nduchess of Kendal, he at last received his pardon, returned to London in\r\nJune or July, and placed his services at the disposal of Walpole, by\r\nwhom, however, his offers to procure the accession of several Tories to\r\nthe administration were received very coldly. During the following\r\nwinter he made himself useful in France in gaining information for the\r\ngovernment. In 1725 an act was passed enabling him to hold real estate\r\nbut without power of alienating it.[10] But this had been effected in\r\nconsequence of a peremptory order of the king, against Walpole's wishes,\r\nwho succeeded in maintaining his exclusion from the House of Lords. He\r\nnow bought an estate at Dawley, near Uxbridge, where he renewed his\r\nintimacy with Pope, Swift and Voltaire, took part in Pope's literary\r\nsquabbles, and wrote the philosophy for the _Essay on Man_. On the first\r\noccasion which offered itself, that of Pulteney's rupture with Walpole\r\nin 1726, he endeavoured to organize an opposition in conjunction with\r\nthe former and Windham; and in 1727 began his celebrated series of\r\nletters to the _Craftsman_, attacking the Walpoles, signed an\r\n\"Occasional Writer.\" He gained over the duchess of Kendal with a bribe\r\nof L11,000 from his wife's estates, and with Walpole's approval obtained\r\nan audience with George. His success was imminent, and it was thought\r\nhis appointment as chief minister was assured. In Walpole's own words,\r\n\"as St John had the duchess entirely on his side I need not add what\r\nmust or might in time have been the consequence,\" and he prepared for\r\nhis dismissal. But once more Bolingbroke's \"fortune turned rotten at the\r\nvery moment it grew ripe,\"[11] and his projects and hopes were ruined by\r\nthe king's death in June.[12] Further papers from his pen signed \"John\r\nTrot\" appeared in the _Craftsman_ in 1728, and in 1730 followed _Remarks\r\non the History of England by Humphrey Oldcastle_, attacking the\r\nWalpoles' policy. The assault on the government prompted by Bolingbroke\r\nwas continued in the House of Commons by Windham, and great efforts were\r\nmade to establish the alliance between the Tories and the Opposition\r\nWhigs. The Excise Bill in 1733 and the Septennial Bill in the following\r\nyear offered opportunities for further attacks on the government, which\r\nBolingbroke supported by a new series of papers in the _Craftsman_\r\nstyled \"A Dissertation on Parties\"; but the whole movement collapsed\r\nafter the new elections, which returned Walpole to power in 1735 with a\r\nlarge majority.\r\n\r\nBolingbroke retired baffled and disappointed from the fray to France in\r\nJune, residing principally at the chateau of Argeville near\r\nFontainebleau. He now wrote his _Letters on the Study of History_\r\n(printed privately before his death and published in 1752), and the\r\n_True Use of Retirement_. In 1738 he visited England, became one of the\r\nleading friends and advisers of Frederick, prince of Wales, who now\r\nheaded the opposition, and wrote for the occasion _The Patriot King_,\r\nwhich together with a previous essay, _The Spirit of Patriotism_, and\r\n_The State of Parties at the Accession of George I._, were entrusted to\r\nPope and not published. Having failed, however, to obtain any share in\r\npolitics, he returned to France in 1739, and subsequently sold Dawley.\r\nIn 1742 and 1743 he again visited England and quarrelled with Warburton.\r\nIn 1744 he settled finally at Battersea with his friend Hugh Hume, 3rd\r\nearl of Marchmont, and was present at Pope's death in May. The discovery\r\nthat the poet had printed secretly 1500 copies of _The Patriot King_\r\ncaused him to publish a correct version in 1749, and stirred up a\r\nfurther altercation with Warburton, who defended his friend against\r\nBolingbroke's bitter aspersions, the latter, whose conduct was generally\r\nreprehended, publishing a _Familiar Epistle to the most Impudent Man\r\nLiving_. In 1744 he had been very busy assisting in the negotiations for\r\nthe establishment of the new \"broad bottom\" administration, and showed\r\nno sympathy for the Jacobite expedition in 1745. He recommended the\r\ntutor for Prince George, afterwards George III. About 1749 he wrote the\r\n_Present State of the Nation_, an unfinished pamphlet. Lord Chesterfield\r\nrecords the last words heard from him: \"God who placed me here will do\r\nwhat He pleases with me hereafter and He knows best what to do.\" He died\r\non the 12th of December 1751, his wife having predeceased him in 1750.\r\nThey were both buried in the parish church at Battersea, where a\r\nmonument with medallions and inscriptions composed by Bolingbroke was\r\nerected to their memory.\r\n\r\nThe writings and career of Bolingbroke make a far weaker impression upon\r\nposterity than they made on contemporaries. His genius and character\r\nwere superficial; his abilities were exercised upon ephemeral objects,\r\nand not inspired by lasting or universal ideas. Bute and George III.\r\nindeed derived their political ideas from _The Patriot King_, but the\r\ninfluence which he is said to have exercised upon Voltaire, Gibbon and\r\nBurke is very problematical. Burke wrote his _Vindication of Natural\r\nSociety_ in imitation of Bolingbroke's style, but in refutation of his\r\nprinciples; and in the _Reflections on the French Revolution_ he\r\nexclaims, \"Who now reads Bolingbroke, who ever read him through?\" Burke\r\ndenies that Bolingbroke's words left \"any permanent impression on his\r\nmind.\" Bolingbroke's conversation, described by Lord Chesterfield as\r\n\"such a flowing happiness of expression that even his most familiar\r\nconversations if taken down in writing would have borne the press\r\nwithout the least correction,\" his delightful companionship, his wit,\r\ngood looks, and social qualities which charmed during his lifetime and\r\nmade firm friendships with men of the most opposite character, can now\r\nonly be faintly imagined. His most brilliant gift was his eloquence,\r\nwhich according to Swift was acknowledged by men of all factions to be\r\nunrivalled. None of his great orations has survived, a loss regretted by\r\nPitt more than that of the missing books of Livy and Tacitus, and no art\r\nperishes more completely with its possessor than that of oratory. His\r\npolitical works, in which the expression is often splendidly eloquent,\r\nspirited and dignified, are for the most part exceedingly rhetorical in\r\nstyle, while his philosophical essays were undertaken with the chief\r\nobject of displaying his eloquence, and no characteristic renders\r\nwritings less readable for posterity. They are both deficient in\r\nsolidity and in permanent interest. The first deals with mere party\r\nquestions without sincerity and without depth; and the second, composed\r\nas an amusement in retirement without any serious preparation, in their\r\nattacks on metaphysics and theology and in their feeble deism present no\r\noriginality and carry no conviction. Both kinds reflect in their\r\nVoltairian superficiality Bolingbroke's manner of life, which was\r\nthroughout uninspired by any great ideas or principles and thoroughly\r\nfalse and superficial. Though a libertine and a free-thinker, he had\r\nchampioned the most bigoted and tyrannical high-church measures. His\r\ndiplomacy had been subordinated to party necessities. He had supported\r\nby turns and simultaneously Jacobite and Hanoverian interests. He had\r\nonly conceived the idea of _The Patriot King_ in the person of the\r\nworthless Frederick in order to stir up sedition, while his eulogies on\r\nretirement and study were pronounced from an enforced exile. He only\r\nattacked party government because he was excluded from it, and only\r\nrailed at corruption because it was the corruption of his antagonists\r\nand not his own. His public life presents none of those acts of devotion\r\nand self-sacrifice which often redeem a career characterized by errors,\r\nfollies and even crimes.\r\n\r\nOne may deplore his unfortunate history and wasted genius, but it is\r\nimpossible to regret his exclusion from the government of England. He\r\nwas succeeded in the title as 2nd Viscount Bolingbroke, according to the\r\nspecial remainder, by his nephew Frederick, 3rd Viscount St John (a\r\ntitle granted to Bolingbroke's father in 1716), from whom the title has\r\ndescended.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--Bolingbroke's collected works, including his chief\r\n  political writings already mentioned and his philosophical essays\r\n  _Concerning the Nature, Extent and Reality of Human Knowledge_, _On\r\n  the Folly and Presumption of Philosophers_, _On the Rise and Progress\r\n  of Monotheism_, and _On Authority in Matters of Religion_, were first\r\n  published in Mallet's faulty edition in 1754,--according to Johnson's\r\n  well-known denunciation, \"the blunderbuss charged against religion and\r\n  morality,\"--and subsequently in 1778, 1809 and 1841. _A Collection of\r\n  Political Tracts_ by Bolingbroke was published in 1748.

Walpole in _Letters_ (ed.\r\n    1903), iii. 269; but he was not always well informed concerning his\r\n    father's career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLIVAR, SIMON (1783-1830), the hero of South American independence, was\r\nborn in the city of Caracas, Venezuela, on the 24th of July 1783. His\r\nfather was Juan Vicente Bolivar y Ponte, and his mother Maria Concepcion\r\nPalacios y Sojo, both descended from noble families in Venezuela.\r\nBolivar was sent to Europe to prosecute his studies, and resided at\r\nMadrid for several years. Having completed his education, he spent some\r\ntime in travelling, chiefly in the south of Europe, and visited Paris,\r\nwhere he was an eye-witness of some of the last scenes of the\r\nRevolution. Returning to Madrid, he married, in 1801, the daughter of\r\nDon N. Toro, uncle of the marquis of Toro in Caracas, and embarked with\r\nher for Venezuela, intending, it is said, to devote himself to the\r\nimprovement of his large estate. But the premature death of his young\r\nwife, who fell a victim to yellow fever, drove him again to Europe.\r\nReturning home in 1809 he passed through the United States, where, for\r\nthe first time, he had an opportunity of observing the working of free\r\ninstitutions; and soon after his arrival in Venezuela he appears to have\r\nidentified himself with the cause of independence which had already\r\nagitated the Spanish colonies for some years. Being one of the\r\npromoters of the insurrection at Caracas in April 1810, he received a\r\ncolonel's commission from the revolutionary junta, and was associated\r\nwith Louis Lopez Mendez in a mission to the court of Great Britain.\r\nVenezuela declared its independence on the 5th of July 1811, and in the\r\nfollowing year the war commenced in earnest by the advance of Monteverde\r\nwith the Spanish troops. Bolivar was entrusted with the command of the\r\nimportant post of Puerto Cabello, but not being supported he had to\r\nevacuate the place; and owing to the inaction of Miranda the Spaniards\r\nrecovered their hold over the country.\r\n\r\nLike others of the revolutionists Bolivar took to flight, and succeeded\r\nin reaching Curacao in safety. He did not, however, remain long in\r\nretirement, but in September 1812, hearing of important movements in New\r\nGranada, repaired to Cartagena, where he received a commission to\r\noperate against the Spanish troops on the Magdalena river. In this\r\nexpedition he proved eminently successful, driving the Spaniards from\r\npost to post, until arriving at the confines of Venezuela he boldly\r\ndetermined to enter that province and try conclusions with General\r\nMonteverde himself. His troops did not number more than 500 men; but, in\r\nspite of many discouragements, he forced his way to Merida and Truxillo,\r\ntowns of some importance in the west of Venezuela, and succeeded in\r\nraising the population to his support. Forming his increased forces into\r\ntwo divisions, he committed the charge of one to his colleague Rivas,\r\nand pushing on for Caracas the capital, issued his decree of \"war to the\r\ndeath.\" A decisive battle ensued at Lastoguanes, where the Spanish\r\ntroops under Monteverde sustained a crushing defeat. Caracas was entered\r\nin triumph on the 4th of August 1813, and Monteverde took refuge in\r\nPuerto Cabello. General Marino effected the liberation of the eastern\r\ndistrict of Venezuela, and the patriots obtained entire possession of\r\nthe country in January 1814. This success was, however, of very brief\r\nduration. The royalists, effectually roused by the reverses they had\r\nsustained, concentrated all their means, and a number of sanguinary\r\nencounters ensued. Bolivar was eventually defeated by Boves near Cura,\r\nin the plains of La Puerta, and compelled to embark for Cumana with the\r\nshattered remains of his forces. Caracas was retaken by the Spaniards in\r\nJuly; and before the end of the year 1814 the royalists were again the\r\nundisputed masters of Venezuela. From Cumana Bolivar repaired to\r\nCartagena, and thence to Tunja, where the revolutionary congress of New\r\nGranada was sitting. Here, notwithstanding his misfortunes and the\r\nefforts of his personal enemies, he was received and treated with great\r\nconsideration. The congress appointed him to conduct an expedition\r\nagainst Santa Fe de Bogota, where Don Cundinamarca had refused to\r\nacknowledge the new coalition of the provinces. In December 1814 he\r\nappeared before Bogota with a force of 2000 men, and obliged the\r\nrecalcitrant leaders to capitulate,--a service for which he received the\r\nthanks of congress. In the meanwhile Santa Martha had fallen into the\r\nhands of the royalists, and Bolivar was ordered to the relief of the\r\nplace. In this, however, he was not successful, General Morillo having\r\nlanded an overwhelming Spanish force. Hopeless of the attempt he\r\nresigned his commission and embarked for Kingston, Jamaica, in May 1814.\r\nWhile residing there an attempt was made upon his life by a hired\r\nassassin, who, in mistake, murdered his secretary.\r\n\r\nFrom Kingston Bolivar went to Aux Cayes in Haiti, where he was furnished\r\nwith a small force by President Petion. An expedition was organized, and\r\nlanded on the mainland in May 1816, but proved a failure. Nothing\r\ndaunted, however, he obtained reinforcements at Aux Cayes, and in\r\nDecember landed first in Margarita, and then at Barcelona. Here a\r\nprovisional government was formed, and troops were assembled to resist\r\nMorillo, who was then advancing at the head of a strong division. The\r\nhostile forces encountered each other on the 16th of February 1817, when\r\na desperate conflict ensued, which lasted during that and the two\r\nfollowing days, and ended in the defeat of the royalists. Morillo\r\nretired in disorder, and being met on his retreat by J.A. Paez with his\r\n_llaneros_, suffered an additional and more complete overthrow. Being\r\nnow recognized as commander-in-chief, Bolivar proceeded in his career\r\nof victory, and before the close of the year had fixed his headquarters\r\nat Angostura on the Orinoco. At the opening of the congress which\r\nassembled in that city on the 15th February 1819 he submitted an\r\nelaborate exposition of his views on government, and concluded by\r\nsurrendering his authority into the hands of congress. Being, however,\r\nrequired to resume his power, and retain it until the independence of\r\nthe country had been completely established, he reorganized his troops,\r\nand set out from Angostura, in order to cross the Cordilleras, effect a\r\njunction with General Santander, who commanded the republican force in\r\nNew Granada, and bring their united forces into action against the\r\ncommon enemy. This bold and original design was crowned with complete\r\nsuccess. In July 1819 he entered Tunja, after a sharp action on the\r\nadjoining heights; and on the 7th of August he gained the victory of\r\nBoyaca, which gave him immediate possession of Bogota and all New\r\nGranada.\r\n\r\nHis return to Angostura was a sort of national festival. He was hailed\r\nas the deliverer and father of his country, and all manner of\r\ndistinctions and congratulations were heaped upon him. Availing himself\r\nof the favourable moment, he obtained the enactment of the fundamental\r\nlaw of the 17th of December 1819, by which the republics of Venezuela\r\nand New Granada were henceforth to be united in a single state, under\r\nhis presidency, by the title of the Republic of Colombia. The seat of\r\ngovernment was also transferred provisionally to Rosario de Cucuta, on\r\nthe frontier of the two provinces, and Bolivar again took the field.\r\nBeing now at the head of the most numerous and best appointed army the\r\nrepublicans had yet assembled, he gained important advantages over the\r\nSpaniards under Morillo, and on the 25th of November 1820 concluded at\r\nTruxillo an armistice of six months, probably in the hope that the\r\nSpaniards would come to terms, and that the further effusion of blood\r\nmight be spared. If such were his views, however, they were\r\ndisappointed. Morillo was recalled, and General Torre assumed the\r\ncommand. The armistice was allowed to expire, and a renewal of the\r\ncontest became inevitable. Bolivar therefore resolved, if possible, to\r\nstrike a decisive blow; and this accordingly he did at Carabobo, where,\r\nencountering Torre, he so completely routed the Spaniards that the\r\nshattered remains of their army were forced to take refuge in Puerto\r\nCabello, where two years after they surrendered to Paez. The battle of\r\nCarabobo may be considered as having put an end to the war in Venezuela.\r\nOn the 29th of June 1821 Bolivar entered Caracas, and by the close of\r\nthe year the Spaniards were driven from every part of the province\r\nexcept Puerto Cabello. The next step was to secure, by permanent\r\npolitical institutions, the independence which had been so dearly\r\npurchased; and, accordingly, on the 30th of August 1821 the constitution\r\nof Colombia was adopted with general approbation, Bolivar himself being\r\npresident, and Santander vice-president.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, more work for him to do. The Spaniards, though\r\nexpelled from Colombia, still held possession of the neighbouring\r\nprovinces of Ecuador and Peru; and Bolivar determined to complete the\r\nliberation of the whole country. Placing himself at the head of the\r\narmy, he marched on Quito in Ecuador. A severe battle was fought at\r\nPichincha, where, by the prowess of his colleague Sucre, the Spaniards\r\nwere routed, and Quito was entered by the republicans in June 1822.\r\nBolivar then marched upon Lima, which the royalists evacuated at his\r\napproach; and entering the capital in triumph, he was invested with\r\nabsolute power as dictator, and authorized to call into action all the\r\nresources of the country. Owing, however, to the intrigues of the\r\nrepublican factions in Peru he was forced to withdraw to Truxillo,\r\nleaving the capital to the mercy of the Spaniards under Canterac, by\r\nwhom it was immediately occupied. But this misfortune proved only\r\ntemporary. By June 1824 the liberating army was completely organized;\r\nand taking the field soon after, it routed the vanguard of the enemy.\r\nImproving his advantage, Bolivar pressed forward, and on the 6th of\r\nAugust defeated Canterac on the plains of Junin, after which he returned\r\nto Lima, leaving Sucre to follow the royalists in their retreat to\r\nUpper Peru--an exploit which the latter executed with equal ability and\r\nsuccess, gaining a decisive victory at Ayacucho, and thus completing the\r\ndispersion of the Spanish force. The possessions of the Spaniards in\r\nPeru were now confined to the castles of Callao, which Rodil maintained\r\nfor upwards of a year, in spite of all the means that could be employed\r\nfor their reduction. In June 1825 Bolivar visited Upper Peru, which,\r\nhaving detached itself from the government of Buenos Aires, was formed\r\ninto a separate state, called Bolivia, in honour of the liberator. The\r\nfirst congress of the new republic assembled in August 1825, when\r\nBolivar was declared perpetual protector, and requested to prepare for\r\nit a constitution of government.\r\n\r\nHis care was now directed to the administration of the affairs of the\r\nfreed provinces. His endeavours to satisfy his countrymen in this\r\nrespect did not always meet with encouragement, and sometimes exposed\r\nhim to slander. In December 1824 Bolivar convoked a constituent congress\r\nfor the February following; but this body, taking into consideration the\r\nunsettled state of the country, thought it proper to invest him with\r\ndictatorial power for another year. His project of a constitution for\r\nBolivia was presented to the congress of that state on the 25th of May\r\n1826, accompanied with an address, in which he embodied his opinions\r\nrespecting the form of government which he conceived most expedient for\r\nthe newly established republics. This code, however, did not give\r\nsatisfaction. Its most extraordinary feature consisted in the provision\r\nfor lodging the executive authority in the hands of a president for\r\nlife, without responsibility and with power to nominate his successor, a\r\nproposal which alarmed the friends of liberty, and excited lively\r\napprehensions amongst the republicans of Buenos Aires and Chile; whilst\r\nin Peru, Bolivar was accused of a design to unite into one state\r\nColombia, Peru and Bolivia, and to render himself perpetual dictator of\r\nthe confederacy.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the affairs of Colombia had taken a turn which demanded\r\nthe presence of Bolivar in his own country. During his absence Santander\r\nhad administered the government of the state ably and uprightly, and its\r\nindependence had been recognized by other countries. But Paez, who\r\ncommanded in Venezuela, having been accused of arbitrary conduct in the\r\nenrolment of the citizens of Caracas in the militia, refused obedience\r\nto the summons of the senate, and placed himself in a state of open\r\nrebellion against the government, being encouraged by a disaffected\r\nparty in the northern departments who desired separation from the rest\r\nof the republic.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, having entrusted the government to a council nominated by\r\nhimself, with Santa Cruz at its head, Bolivar set out from Lima in\r\nSeptember 1826, and hastening to Bogota, arrived there on the 14th of\r\nNovember. He immediately assumed the extraordinary powers which by the\r\nconstitution the president was authorized to exercise in case of\r\nrebellion. After a short stay in the capital he pressed forward to stop\r\nthe effusion of blood in Venezuela, where matters had gone much farther\r\nthan he could have contemplated. On the 31st of December he reached\r\nPuerto Cabello, and the following day he issued a decree offering a\r\ngeneral amnesty. He had then a friendly meeting with Paez and soon after\r\nentered Caracas, where he fixed his headquarters, in order to check the\r\nnorthern departments, which had been the principal theatre of the\r\ndisturbances. In the meanwhile Bolivar and Santander were re-elected to\r\nthe respective offices of president and vice-president, and by law they\r\nshould have qualified as such in January 1827. In February, however,\r\nBolivar formally resigned the presidency of the republic, at the same\r\ntime expressing a determination to refute the imputations of ambition\r\nwhich had been so freely cast upon him, by retiring into private life,\r\nand spending the remainder of his days on his patrimonial estate.\r\nSantander combated this proposal, urging him to resume his station as\r\nconstitutional president, and declaring his own conviction that the\r\ntroubles and agitations of the country could only be appeased by the\r\nauthority and personal influence of the liberator himself. This view\r\nbeing confirmed by a resolution of congress, although it was not a\r\nunanimous one, Bolivar decided to resume his functions, and he repaired\r\nto Bogota to take the oaths. Before his arrival, however, he issued\r\nsimultaneously three separate decrees--one granting a general amnesty,\r\nanother convoking a national convention at Ocana, and a third for\r\nestablishing constitutional order throughout Colombia. His arrival was\r\naccelerated by the occurrence of events in Peru and the southern\r\ndepartments which struck at the very foundation of his power. Not long\r\nafter his departure from Lima, the Bolivian code had been adopted as the\r\nconstitution of Peru, and Bolivar had been declared president for life\r\non the 9th of December 1826, the anniversary of the battle of Ayacucho.\r\nAt this time the Colombian auxiliary army was cantoned in Peru, and the\r\nthird division, stationed at Lima, consisting of veteran troops under\r\nLara and Sands, became distrustful of Bolivar's designs on the freedom\r\nof the republic. Accordingly, in about six weeks after the adoption of\r\nBolivar's new constitution, a counter-revolution in the government of\r\nPeru was effected by this body of dissatisfied veterans, and the\r\nPeruvians, availing themselves of the opportunity, abjured the Bolivian\r\ncode, deposed the council appointed by the liberator, and proceeded to\r\norganize a provisional government for themselves. After this bloodless\r\nrevolution the third division embarked at Callao on the 17th of March\r\n1827, and landed in the southern department of Colombia in the following\r\nmonth. Intelligence of these events reached Bolivar while in the north\r\nof Colombia, and he lost no time in preparing to march against the\r\nrefractory troops, who formerly had placed such implicit confidence in\r\nhim. But he was spared the necessity of coming to blows, for the\r\nleaders, finding the government in the hands of the national executive,\r\nhad peaceably submitted to General Ovando. In the meanwhile Bolivar had\r\naccepted the presidency, and resumed the functions belonging to his\r\nofficial position. But although Colombia was, to all external\r\nappearance, restored to tranquillity, the nation was divided into two\r\nparties. Bolivar had, no doubt, regained the personal confidence of the\r\nofficers and soldiers of the third division; but the republican party,\r\nwith Santander at their head, continued to regard with undisguised\r\napprehension his ascendancy over the army, suspecting him of a desire to\r\nimitate the career of Napoleon. In the meanwhile all parties looked\r\nanxiously to the convention of Ocana, which was to assemble in March\r\n1828, for a decided expression of the national will. The republicans\r\nhoped that the issue of its deliberations would be favourable to their\r\nviews; whilst the military, on the other hand, did not conceal their\r\nconviction that a stronger and more permanent form of government was\r\nessential to the public welfare. The latter view seems to have\r\nprevailed. In virtue of a decree, dated Bogota, the 27th of August 1828,\r\nBolivar assumed the supreme power in Colombia, and continued to exercise\r\nit until his death, which took place at San Pedro, near Santa Marta, on\r\nthe 17th of December 1830.\r\n\r\nBolivar spent nine-tenths of a splendid patrimony in the service of his\r\ncountry; and although he had for a considerable period unlimited control\r\nover the revenues of three countries--Colombia, Peru and Bolivia--he\r\ndied without a shilling of public money in his possession. He achieved\r\nthe independence of three states, and called forth a new spirit in the\r\nsouthern portion of the New World. He purified the administration of\r\njustice; he encouraged the arts and sciences; he fostered national\r\ninterests, and he induced other countries to recognize that independence\r\nwhich was in a great measure the fruit of his own exertions. His remains\r\nwere removed in 1842 to Caracas, where a monument was erected to his\r\nmemory; a statue was put up in Bogota in 1846; in 1858 the Peruvians\r\nfollowed the example by erecting an equestrian statue of the liberator\r\nin Lima; and in 1884 a statue was erected in Central Park, New York.\r\n\r\n  Twenty-two volumes of official documents bearing on Bolivar's career\r\n  were officially published at Caracas in 1826-1833. There are lives by\r\n  Larrazabal (New York, 1866); Rojas (Madrid, 1883); and\r\n  Ducoudray-Holstein (Paris, 1831). Two volumes of his correspondence\r\n  were published in New York in 1866.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLIVAR, till 1908 a department of Colombia, bounded N. and W. by the\r\nCaribbean Sea, E. by the departments of Magdalena and Santander, S. by\r\nAntioquia and S.W. by Cauca. It has an area of 27,028 sq. m., composed\r\nin great part of low, alluvial plains, densely wooded, but slightly\r\ncultivated and unsuited for north European labour. The population,\r\nestimated at 323,097 in 1899, is composed largely of mixed races; in\r\nsome localities the inhabitants of mixed race are estimated to\r\nconstitute four-fifths of the population. The capital, Cartagena on the\r\nCaribbean coast, was once the principal commercial entrepot of Colombia.\r\nOther important towns are Barranquilla and Mompox (8000), on the\r\nMagdalena river, and Corozal (9000) and Lorica (10,596 in 1902), near\r\nthe western coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLIVAR, an inland state of Venezuela, lying S. of the Orinoco and\r\nApure, with the Yuruari territory on the E., the Caroni river forming\r\nthe boundary, and the Amazonas territory and Brazil on the S. Frequent\r\npolitical changes in Venezuela have led to various modifications in the\r\nsize and outlines of this state, which comprises large areas of\r\nuninhabited territory. It is a country of extensive plains (_llanos_)\r\ncovered in the rainy season with nutritious grass which disappears\r\ncompletely in the dry season, and of great forests and numerous rivers.\r\nIts population was given in 1894 as 135,232, but its area has been\r\nlargely reduced since then. The capital is Ciudad Bolivar, formerly\r\ncalled Angostura, which is situated on the right bank of the Orinoco\r\nabout 240 m. above its mouth; pop. 11,686. Vessels of light draught\r\neasily ascend the Orinoco to this point, and a considerable trade is\r\ncarried on, the exports being cocoa, sugar, cotton, hides, jerked beef\r\nand various forest products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLIVIA, an inland republic of South America, once a part of the Spanish\r\nvice-royalty of Peru and known as the province of Charcas, or Upper\r\nPeru. It is the third largest political division of the continent, and\r\nextends, approximately, from 9 deg. 44' to 22 deg. 50' S. lat., and from\r\n58 deg. to 70 deg. W. long. It is bounded N. and E. by Brazil, S. by\r\nParaguay and Argentina, and W. by Chile and Peru. Estimates of area vary\r\nwidely and have been considerably confused by repeated losses of\r\nterritory in boundary disputes with neighbouring states, and no figures\r\ncan be given which may not be changed to some extent by further\r\nrevisions. Official estimates are 640,226 and 703,633 sq. m., but Supan\r\n(_Die Bevolkerung der Erde_, 1904) places it at 515,156 sq. m.\r\n\r\n_Boundaries._--The boundary line between Bolivia and Brazil has its\r\norigin in the limits between the Spanish and Portuguese colonies\r\ndetermined by the treaties of Madrid and San Ildefonso (1750 and 1777),\r\nwhich were modified by the treaties of 1867 and 1903. Beginning at the\r\noutlet of Bahia Negra into the Paraguay river, lat. 28 deg. 08' 35\" S.,\r\nthe line ascends the latter to a point on the west bank 9 kilometres\r\nbelow Fort Coimbra, thence inland 4 kilometres to a point in lat. 19\r\ndeg. 45' 36\" S. and long. 58 deg. 04' 12.7\" W., whence it follows an\r\nirregular course N. and E. of N. to Lakes Mandiore, Gaiba or Gahiba, and\r\nUberaba, then up the San Matias river and N. along the Sierra Ricardo\r\nFranco to the headwaters of the Rio Verde, a tributary of the Guapore.\r\nThis part of the boundary was turned inland from the Paraguay to\r\ninclude, within Brazilian jurisdiction, Fort Coimbra, Corumba and other\r\nsettlements on the west bank, and was modified in 1903 by the recession\r\nof about 1158 sq. m. to Bolivia to provide better commercial facilities\r\non the Paraguay. The line follows the Verde, Guapore, Mamore and Madeira\r\nrivers down to the mouth of the Abuna, in about lat. 9 deg. 44' S., as\r\ndetermined by the treaty of 1903. This is a part of the original\r\ncolonial frontier, which extended down the Madeira to a point midway\r\nbetween the Beni and the Amazon, and then ran due W. to the Javary. The\r\ntreaty of 1867 changed this starting-point to the mouth of the Beni, in\r\nlat. 10 deg. 20' S., and designated a straight line to the source of the\r\nJavary as the frontier, which gave to Brazil a large area of territory;\r\nbut when the valuable rubber forests of the upper Purus became known the\r\nBrazilians invaded them and demanded another modification of the\r\nboundary line. This was finally settled in 1903 by the treaty of\r\nPetropolis, which provided that the line should ascend the Abuna river\r\nto lat. 10 deg. 20' S., thence along that parallel W. to the Rapirran\r\nriver which is followed to its principal source, thence due W. to the\r\nItuxy river which is followed W. to its source, thence to the source of\r\nBahia Creek which is followed to the Acre or Aquiry river, thence up the\r\nlatter to its source, whence if east of the 69th meridian it runs direct\r\nto the 11th parallel which will form the boundary line to the Peruvian\r\nfrontier. This frontier gave about 60,000 sq. m. of territory to Brazil,\r\nfor which the latter gave an indemnity of L2,000,000 and about 1158 sq.\r\nm. of territory on the Matto Grosso frontier. The boundary with Paraguay\r\nis unsettled, but an unratified treaty of the 23rd of November 1894\r\nprovides that the line shall start from a point on the Paraguay river 3\r\nm. north of Fort Olimpo and run south-west in a straight line to an\r\nintersection with the Pilcomayo in long. 61 deg. 28' W., where it unites\r\nwith the Argentine boundary. The boundary with Chile was greatly\r\nmodified by the results of the war of 1879-83, as determined by the\r\ntreaties of 1884, 1886 and 1895, Bolivia losing her department of the\r\nlittoral on the Pacific and all access to the coast except by the grace\r\nof the conqueror. Provisions were made in 1895 for the cession of the\r\nport of Mejillones del Norte and a right of way across the province of\r\nTarapaca, but Peru protested, and negotiations followed for the cession\r\nof Cobija, in the province of Antofagasta. These negotiations proved\r\nfruitless, and in 1904 Bolivia accepted a pecuniary indemnity in lieu of\r\nterritory. The new boundary line starts from the summit of the Sapaleri\r\n(or Zapalegui), where the Argentine, Bolivian and Chilean boundaries\r\nconverge, and runs west to Licancaur, thence north to the most southern\r\nsource of Lake Ascotan which it follows to and across this lake in the\r\ndirection of the Oyahua volcano, and thence in a straight line to the\r\nTua volcano, on the frontier of the province of Tarapaca. From this\r\npoint the line follows the summits of the Cordillera Silillica north to\r\nthe Cerro Paquiza, on the Tacna frontier, and to the Nevado Pomarape,\r\nnear the frontier of Peru. Thence it continues north to an intersection\r\nwith the Desaguadero, in about 16 deg. 45' S. lat., follows that river\r\nto the Winamarca lagoon and Lake Titicaca, and crosses the latter\r\ndiagonally to Huaicho on the north shore. From this point the line\r\ncrosses the Cordillera Real through the valley of the San Juan del Oro\r\nto Suches Lake, follows the Cololo and Apolobamba ranges to the\r\nheadwaters of the Sina river, and thence down that stream to the\r\nInambari. Thence the line either follows the latter to its confluence\r\nwith the Madre de Dios, or the water-parting between that river and the\r\nTambopata or Pando, to the valley of the Madre de Dios, from which point\r\nit runs due north to 12 deg. 40' S. lat., and north-west to the new\r\nBrazilian frontier. The N.W. angle on the map represents the Bolivian\r\nclaim until the settlement of 1909, which gave the territory to Peru.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of Bolivia]\r\n\r\n_Physiography._--Roughly calculated, two-fifths of the total area of\r\nBolivia is comprised within the Andean cordilleras which cross its\r\nsouth-west corner and project east toward the Brazilian highlands in the\r\nform of a great obtuse angle. The Cordilleras, divided into two great\r\nparallel chains, with flanking ranges and spurs to the east, reach their\r\ngreatest breadth at this point and form the _massif_ of the Andean\r\nsystem. It is made up of a number of parallel ranges enclosing great\r\nelevated plateaus broken by transverse ranges and deep ravines.\r\nNorth-east of Lake Titicaca there is a confused mass or knot (the Nudo\r\nde Apolobamba) of lofty intersecting ridges which include some of the\r\nhighest peaks in South America. Below this mountainous area the ranges\r\nopen out and enclose extensive plateaus. The western range, the\r\nCordillera Occidental, a part of the boundary between Bolivia and the\r\nnorthern provinces of Chile, closely follows the coast outline and forms\r\nthe western rampart of the great Bolivian tableland or _alta-planicie_,\r\nwhich extends from the Vilcanota knot in Peru, south to the Serrania de\r\nLipez on the Argentine frontier, is 500 m. long, and about 80 m. broad,\r\nand contains about 40,000 sq. m. The northern part of this plateau is\r\ncommonly called the _puna_; the southern part, the \"desert of Lipez,\" in\r\ncharacter and appearance is part of the great Puna de Atacama. This\r\nplateau has an average elevation of about 12,650 ft. near Lake Titicaca,\r\nbut descends about 1000 ft. toward its southern extremity. It is a great\r\nlacustrine basin where once existed an inland sea having an outlet to\r\nthe east through the La Paz gorge. The plateau is bleak and inhospitable\r\nin the north, barren and arid toward the south, containing great saline\r\ndepressions covered with water in the rainy season, and broken by ridges\r\nand peaks, the highest being the Cerro de Tahua, 17,454 ft. Overlooking\r\nthe plateau from the west are the snow-clad peaks of Pomarape (20,505\r\nft.), Parinacota (20,918 ft.), Sajama (21,047), Huallatiri (21,654),\r\nLirima (19,128), and the three volcanic peaks, Oyahua (19,226), San\r\nPedro y Pablo (19,423) and Licancaur (19,685). The eastern rampart of\r\nthis great plateau is formed by the Cordillera Oriental, which extends\r\nnorth-west into Peru under the name of Carabaya, and south to the\r\nfrontier in broken ranges, one of which trends south-east in the\r\nvicinity of Sucre. The main part of this great range, known as the\r\nCordillera Real, and one of the most imposing mountain masses of the\r\nworld, extends from the Peruvian border south-east to the 18th parallel\r\nand exhibits a series of snow-crowned peaks, notably the triple-crested\r\nIllampu or Sorata (21,490 ft.), Illimani (Conway, 21,204), Cacaaca\r\n(20,571) and Chachacomani (21,434). Of the ranges extending south from\r\nthe Cordillera Real and branching out between the 18th and 19th\r\nparallels, the more prominent are the Frailes which forms the eastern\r\nrampart of the great central plateau and which is celebrated for its\r\nmineral deposits, the Chichas which runs south from the vicinity of\r\nPotosi to the Argentine frontier, and the Livichuco which turns\r\nsouth-east and forms the watershed between the Cachimayo and Pilcomayo.\r\nThe more prominent peaks in and between these ranges are the Asanaque\r\n(16,857), Michaga (17,389), Cuzco (17,930), Potosi (15,381), Chorolque\r\n(18,480) and Tuluma (15,584). At the southern extremity of the great\r\nplateau is the transverse Serrania de Lipez, the culminating crest of\r\nwhich stands 16,404 ft. above sea-level. The eastern rampart of the\r\nBolivian highlands comprises two distinct chains--the Sierra de\r\nCochabamba on the north-east and the Sierra de Misiones on the east.\r\nBetween these and the Cordillera Oriental is an apparently confused mass\r\nof broken, intersecting ranges, which on closer examination are found to\r\nconform more or less closely to the two outside ranges. These have been\r\ndeeply cut by rivers, especially on the north-east, where the rainfall\r\nis heavier. The region enclosed by these ranges is extremely rugged in\r\ncharacter, but it is esteemed highly for its fertile valleys and its\r\nfine climate, and is called the \"Bolivian Switzerland.\" Lying wholly\r\nwithin the tropics, these mountain masses form one of the most\r\ninteresting as well as one of the most imposing and difficult regions of\r\nthe world. At their feet and in their lower valleys the heat is intense\r\nand the vegetation is tropical. Above these are cool, temperate slopes\r\nand valleys, and high above these, bleak, wind-swept passes and\r\nsnow-clad peaks. West of the Cordillera Oriental, where special\r\nconditions prevail, a great desert plateau stretches entirely across one\r\ncorner of the republic. Apart from the Andean system there is a group of\r\nlow, broken, gneiss ranges stretching along the east side of Bolivia\r\namong the upper affluents of the Mamore and Guapore, which appear to\r\nbelong to the older Brazilian orographic system, from which they have\r\nbeen separated by the erosive action of water. They are known as the\r\nSierras de Chiquitos, and are geologically interesting because of their\r\nproximity to the eastern projection of the Andes. Their culminating\r\npoint is Cerro Cochii, 3894 ft. above sea-level, but for the most part\r\nthey are but little more than ranges of low wooded hills, having in\r\ngeneral a north-west and south-east direction between the 15th and 19th\r\nparallels.\r\n\r\nThe popular conception of Bolivia is that of an extremely rugged\r\nmountainous country, although fully three-fifths of it, including the\r\nChiquitos region, is composed of low alluvial plains, great swamps and\r\nflooded bottomlands, and gently undulating forest regions. In the\r\nextreme south are the Bolivian Chaco and the llanos (open grassy plains)\r\nof Manzo, while above these in eastern Chuquisaca and southern Santa\r\nCruz are extensive swamps and low-lying plains, subject to periodical\r\ninundations and of little value for agricultural and pastoral purposes.\r\nThere are considerable areas in this part of Bolivia, however, which lie\r\nabove the floods and afford rich grazing lands. The great drawback to\r\nthis region is defective drainage; the streams have too sluggish a\r\ncurrent to carry off the water in the rainy season. Between the\r\nChiquitos sierras and the Andes are the Llanos de Chiquitos, which have\r\na higher general elevation and a more diversified surface. North of this\r\nelevation, which formed the southern shore of the ancient Mojos Lake,\r\nare the llanos of Guarayos and Mojos, occupying an extensive region\r\ntraversed by the Guapore, San Miguel, Guapay, Mamore, Yacuma, Beni and\r\nMadre de Dios rivers and their numerous tributaries. It was once covered\r\nby the great Mojos Lake, and still contains large undrained areas, like\r\nthat of Lake Rojoagua (or Roguaguado). It contains rich agricultural\r\ndistricts and extensive open plains where cattle-raising has been\r\nsuccessfully followed since the days of the Jesuit missions in that\r\nregion. The lower slopes of the Andes, especially toward the north-west,\r\nwhere the country is traversed by the Beni and Madre de Dios, are\r\ncovered with heavy forests. This is one of the richest districts of\r\nBolivia and is capable of sustaining a large population.\r\n\r\nThe river-systems of Bolivia fall naturally into three distinct\r\nregions--the Amazon, La Plata and Central Plateau. The first includes\r\nthe rivers flowing directly and indirectly into the Madeira, one of the\r\ngreat tributaries of the Amazon, together with some small tributaries of\r\nthe Acre and Purus in the north, all of which form a drainage basin\r\ncovering more than one-half of the republic. The two principal rivers of\r\nthis system are the Mamore and Beni, which unite in lat. 10 deg. 20' S.\r\nto form the Madeira. The Mamore, the upper part of which is called the\r\nChimore, rises on the north-east slopes of the Sierra de Cochabamba a\r\nlittle south of the 17th parallel, and follows a northerly serpentine\r\ncourse to its confluence with the Beni, the greater part of which course\r\nis between the 65th and 66th meridians. The river has a length of about\r\n600 m., fully three-fourths of which, from Chimore (925 ft. above sea\r\nlevel) to the rapids near its mouth, passes across a level plain and is\r\nnavigable. The principal Bolivian tributary of the Mamore, the Guapay or\r\nGrande, which is larger and longer than the former above their\r\nconfluence and should be considered the main stream, rises in the\r\nCordillera Oriental east of Lake Pampa Aullaguas, and flows east to the\r\nnorth extremity of the Sierra de Misiones, where it emerges upon the\r\nBolivian lowlands. Turning to the north in a magnificent curve, it\r\npasses around the south-east extremity of the Sierra de Cochabamba,\r\nskirts the Llanos de Chiquitos, and, turning to the north-west, unites\r\nwith the Mamore at Junta de los Rios in about 15 deg. 20' S. lat. and 64\r\ndeg. 40' W. long. It has a tortuous course of over 700 m., which is\r\ndescribed as not navigable. The principal tributaries of the Guapay are\r\nthe Mizque, Piray or Sara and Yapacani, the last rising on the east\r\nslopes of the Cordillera Real, flowing east by Cochabamba to the\r\nsierras of that name where it breaks through with a great bend to the\r\nnorth. The other large Bolivian tributaries of the Mamore, all rising on\r\nthe north-east flanks of the Andes, are the Chapare, Secure, Manique or\r\nApere and Yacuma, the last draining a region of lakes and swamps north\r\nof the Sierra Chamaya. The Beni and its great affluent, the Madre de\r\nDios, though of smaller volume and extent than the Mamore, are of much\r\ngreater economic importance, owing to their navigability, the fertility\r\nof the region they drain, and the great forests along their banks. North\r\nof the Beni, the Abuna flows into the Madeira. Several of its south\r\ntributaries belong to Bolivia. The Guapore, or Itenez, an affluent of\r\nthe Mamore, is the third large river of this Bolivian drainage basin,\r\nbut it rises in Brazil, on the south slopes of the Sierra dos Parecis,\r\nwhere it flows in a great bend to the south and then west of north to\r\nthe Bolivian frontier in 14 deg. S. lat. From this point to its junction\r\nwith the Mamore, a little north of the 12th parallel, it flows in a\r\nnorthwesterly direction and forms the boundary line between the two\r\nrepublics. Its Brazilian tributaries are comparatively unimportant, but\r\nfrom Bolivia it receives the Baures and the San Miguel, both rising in\r\nthe Sierras de Chiquitos and flowing north-west across the llanos to the\r\nGuapore. The Baures has one large tributary, the Blanco, and the Itonama\r\n(San Miguel) has its origin in Lake Conception, lying among the west\r\nranges of the Chiquitos mountains 952 ft. above sea-level.\r\n\r\nThe south-east drainage basin, which is smaller and economically less\r\nimportant than that of the Madeira, discharges into the Paraguay and\r\nextends from the Sierras de Chiquitos south to the Argentine frontier,\r\nand from the Cordillera Oriental east to the Paraguay. It possesses only\r\none large river in Bolivia, the Pilcomayo, which rises on the east\r\nslopes of the Cordillera Oriental opposite the south end of Lake Pampa\r\nAullaguas and flows east and south-east through the sierra region to the\r\nBolivian Chaco. It flows through a nearly level country with so sluggish\r\na current that its channels are greatly obstructed. Nothing definite is\r\nknown of its tributaries in the Chaco, but in the sierra region it\r\npossesses a number of small tributaries, the largest of which are the\r\nCachimayo, Mataca and Pilaya or Camblaya, the latter formed by the\r\nCotagaita and San Juan. The Bermejo, which is an Argentine river,\r\nreceives one large tributary from the Bolivian uplands, the Tarija or\r\nRio Grande, which drains a small district south-east of the Santa\r\nVictoria sierra. The Bolivian tributaries of the upper Paraguay are\r\nsmall and unimportant. The Otuquis, the most southern of the group, is\r\nformed by the San Rafael and Tucabaca, which drain both slopes of the\r\nCerro Cochii range; but is lost in some great marshes 50 m. from the\r\nParaguay. Another considerable stream of this region, which is lost in\r\nthe great marshy districts of the Bolivian plain, is the Parapiti, which\r\nrises on the eastern slopes of the Sierra de Misiones and flows\r\nnorth-east through a low plain for about 150 m. until lost.\r\n\r\nThe third drainage basin is that of the great central plateau, or\r\n_alta-planicie_. This is one of the most elevated lacustrine basins in\r\nthe world, and though it once drained eastward, now has no surface\r\noutlet. Lake Titicaca receives the waters of several short streams from\r\nthe neighbouring heights and discharges through the Desaguadero, a\r\nsluggish river flowing south for 184 m. with a gradually diminishing\r\ndepth to Lake Pampa Aullaguas or Poopo. The Desaguadero is navigable for\r\nsmall craft, and has two or three small tributaries from the west. Two\r\nsmall streams empty into Lake Pampa Aullaguas, which has a small outlet\r\nin the Lacahahuira flowing west for 60 m. to the Cienegas de\r\n(salt-swamps of) Coipasa. The drainage of this extensive district seems\r\nto be wholly absorbed by the dry soil of the desert and by evaporation.\r\nIn the extreme south the Rio Grande de Lipez is absorbed in the same\r\nway.\r\n\r\nFew of the Bolivian lakes are at all well known. The great lacustrine\r\nbasin between the Beni and the Mamore contains several lakes and\r\nlagoons, two of them of large size. These are Lake Rogagua whose waters\r\nfind their way into the Beni through Rio Negro, and the Roguaguado\r\nlagoon and marshes which cover a large area of territory near the\r\nMamore. The latter has an elevation little, if any, above the level of\r\nthe Mamore, which apparently drains this region, and its area has been\r\nestimated at about 580 sq. m. Lake Conception, in the Chiquitos\r\nmountains, belongs to this same hydrographic area. In the south-east\r\nthere are several large shallow lakes whose character and size change\r\nwith the season. They fill slight depressions and are caused by\r\ndefective drainage. Near the Paraguay there are several of these lakes,\r\npartly caused by obstructed outlets, such as Bahia Negra, Caceres,\r\nMandiore, Gaiba and Uberaba, some of them of sufficient depth to be\r\nnavigable by small craft. Above the latter are the great Xarayes swamps,\r\nsometimes described as a lake. This region, like that of the north, is\r\nsubject to periodical inundations in the summer months (November-March\r\nor even May), when extensive areas of level country are flooded and\r\ntraffic is possible only by the use of boats. The two principal lakes of\r\nthe plateau region are Titicaca and Pampa Aullaguas or Poopo. The former\r\nlies near the north end of the great Bolivian _alta-planicie_, 12,644\r\nft. above sea-level, being one of the most elevated lakes of the world.\r\nIt is indented with numerous bays and coves; its greatest length is 138\r\nm., and its greatest breadth 69 m. According to a survey made by Dr M.\r\nNeveau-Lemaire (_La Geographie_, ix. p. 409, Paris, 1904), its water\r\nsurface, excluding islands and peninsulas, is 1969 sq. m., and its\r\ngreatest depth is 892 ft. The level of the lake rises about 5 in. in\r\nsummer; the loss in winter is even greater. The lake belongs to both\r\nBolivia and Peru, and is navigated by steamers running between Bolivian\r\nports and the Peruvian railway port of Puno. The outlet of the lake is\r\nthrough the Desaguadero river. It has several islands, the largest of\r\nwhich bears the same name and contains highly interesting archaeological\r\nmonuments of a prehistoric civilization usually attributed to the Incas.\r\nLake Pampa Aullaguas or Poopo is about 180 m. south-east of Titicaca,\r\nand is fed principally by its outflow. It lies 505 ft. below the level\r\nof Titicaca, which gives an average fall for the Desaguadero of very\r\nnearly 21 ft. per mile. The Pampa Aullaguas has an estimated area of 386\r\nsq. m., and has one large inhabited island. The lake is shallow and the\r\ndistrict about it is sparsely populated. Its outlet is through the\r\nLacahahuira river into the Coipasa swamp, and it is estimated that the\r\noutflow is much less than the inflow, showing a considerable loss by\r\nevaporation and earth absorption.\r\n\r\nHaving no sea-coast, Bolivia has no seaport except what may be granted\r\nin usufruct by Chile.\r\n\r\n  _Geology._--The eastern ranges of ihe Bolivian Andes are formed of\r\n  Palaeozoic rocks with granitic and other intrusions; the Western\r\n  Cordillera consists chiefly of Jurassic and Cretaceous beds, together\r\n  with the lavas and ashes of the great volcanoes; while the intervening\r\n  plateau is covered by freshwater and terrestrial deposits through\r\n  which rise ridges of Palaeozoic rock and of a series of red sandstones\r\n  and gypsiferous marls of somewhat uncertain age (probably, in part at\r\n  least, Cretaceous). The Palaeozoic beds have yielded fossils of\r\n  Cambrian, Ordovician, Devonian and Carboniferous age. In southern\r\n  Bolivia Cambrian and Ordovician beds form the greater part of the\r\n  eastern Andes, but farther north the Devonian and Carboniferous are\r\n  extensively developed, especially in the north-eastern ranges. The\r\n  hills, known as the Chiquitos, which rise from the plains of eastern\r\n  Bolivia, are composed of ancient sedimentary rocks of unknown age. The\r\n  Palaeozoic beds are directly overlaid by a series of red sandstones\r\n  and gypsiferous marls, similar to the _formacion petrolifera_ of\r\n  Argentina and Brazil. At the base there is frequently a conglomerate\r\n  or tuff of porphyritic rocks. Marine fossils found by Gustav Steinmann\r\n  in the middle of the series are said to indicate an age not earlier\r\n  than the Jurassic, and Steinmann refers them to the Lower Cretaceous.\r\n  It is, however, not improbable that the series may represent more than\r\n  one geological system. No later marine deposits have been found either\r\n  in the eastern Andes or in the plains of Bolivia, but freshwater beds\r\n  of Tertiary and later date occupy a wide area. The recent deposits,\r\n  which cover so large a part of the depression between the Eastern and\r\n  the Western Cordillera, appear to be partly of torrential origin, like\r\n  the talus-fans at the foot of mountain ranges in other dry regions;\r\n  but Lakes Titicaca and Pampa Aullaguas (Poopo) were undoubtedly at one\r\n  time rather more extensive than they are to-day. The volcanoes of\r\n  Bolivia lie almost entirely in the Western Cordillera--the great\r\n  summits of the eastern range, such as Illimani and Sorata, being\r\n  formed of Palaeozoic rocks with granitic and other intrusions. The\r\n  gold, silver and tin of Bolivia occur chiefly in the Palaeozoic rocks\r\n  of the eastern ranges. The copper belongs mostly to the red sandstone\r\n  series.\r\n\r\n_Climate._--Bolivia lies wholly within the torrid zone, and variations\r\nin temperature are therefore due to elevation, mountain barriers and\r\nprevailing winds. The country possesses every gradation of temperature,\r\nfrom that of the tropical lowlands to the Arctic cold of the snow-capped\r\npeaks directly above. This vertical arrangement of climatic zones is\r\nmodified to some extent (less than in Argentina) by varying rainfall\r\nconditions, which are governed by the high mountain ranges crossing one\r\ncorner of the republic, and also by the prevailing winds. The trade\r\nwinds give to S. Bolivia a wet and dry season similar to that of N.\r\nArgentina. Farther north, and east of the Cordillera Oriental, rains\r\nfall throughout the year, though the summer months (November-March) are\r\nusually described as the rainy season. On the west side of the\r\nCordillera, which extracts the moisture from the prevailing easterly\r\nwinds, the elevated plateaus have a limited rainfall in the north, which\r\ndiminishes toward the south until the surface becomes absolutely barren.\r\nBrief and furious rain-storms sometimes sweep the northern plateau, but\r\nthese are not frequent and occur during a short season only. Electrical\r\nwind storms are frequent in these high altitudes.\r\n\r\n  Bolivia has a wide range of temperature between places of the same\r\n  latitude. The natives designate the Bolivian climatic zones as\r\n  _yungas, valle_ or _medio yungas, cabezera de valle, puna_ and _puna\r\n  brava_. The _yungas_ comprises all the lowlands and the mountain\r\n  valleys up to an elevation of 5000 ft. The temperature is tropical,\r\n  winter is unknown and the atmosphere is exceedingly humid. The mean\r\n  temperature, according to official estimates, is 70 deg. F., but this\r\n  probably represents the average between the higher elevations and the\r\n  low country. The _valle_ zone includes the deep valleys from 5000 to\r\n  9500 ft., has a warm climate with moderate variations in temperature\r\n  and no cold weather, is sub-tropical in character and productions, and\r\n  is sometimes described as a region of perpetual summer. The _cabezera\r\n  de valle_, as the name indicates, includes the heads of the deep\r\n  valleys above the _valle_ zone, with elevations ranging from 9500 to\r\n  11,000 ft.; its climate is temperate, is divided into regular seasons,\r\n  and is favourable to the production of cereals and vegetables. The\r\n  _puna_, which lies between 11,000 and 12,500 ft., includes the great\r\n  central plateau of Bolivia. It has but two seasons, a cold summer or\r\n  autumn and winter. The air is cold and dry, and the warmer season is\r\n  too short for the production of anything but potatoes and barley. The\r\n  mean temperature is officially estimated as 54 deg. F. The _puna\r\n  brava_ extends from 12,500 ft. up to the snow limit (about 17,500\r\n  ft.), and covers a bleak, inhospitable territory, inhabited only by\r\n  shepherds and miners. Above this is the region of eternal snow, an\r\n  Arctic zone within the tropics. In general, the sub-tropical (_valle_)\r\n  and temperate (_cabezera de valle_) regions of Bolivia are healthy and\r\n  agreeable, have a plentiful rainfall, moderate temperature in the\r\n  shade, and varied and abundant products. There is a high rate of\r\n  mortality among the natives, due to unsanitary habits and diet, and\r\n  not to the climate. In the tropical _yungas_ the ground is covered\r\n  with decaying vegetation, and malaria and fevers are common. There are\r\n  localities in the open country and on exposed elevations where healthy\r\n  conditions prevail, but the greater part of this region is considered\r\n  unhealthy. The prevailing winds are easterly, bringing moisture across\r\n  Brazil from the Atlantic, but eastern Bolivia is also exposed to hot,\r\n  oppressive winds from the north, and to violent cold winds (_surazos_)\r\n  from the Argentine plains, which have been known to cause a fall of\r\n  temperature of 36 deg. within a few hours. According to the _Sinopsis\r\n  Estadistica y Geografica de la Republica de Bolivia_ (La Paz, 1903),\r\n  the average mean temperature and the annual rainfall in eastern\r\n  Bolivia are as follows: 10 deg. S. lat., 90.8 deg. F. and 31.5 in.\r\n  rainfall; 15 deg. S. lat., 86 deg. F. and 30.7 in. rainfall; 20 deg.\r\n  S. lat., 81 deg. F. and 30 in. rainfall; and 25 deg. S. lat., 76.8\r\n  deg. F. and 29.3 in. rainfall.\r\n\r\n_Fauna._--The indigenous fauna of Bolivia corresponds closely to that of\r\nthe neighbouring districts of Argentina, Brazil and Peru. Numerous\r\nspecies of monkeys inhabit the forests of the tropical region, together\r\nwith the puma, jaguar, wildcat, coati, tapir or _anta_, sloth, ant-bear,\r\npaca (_Coelogenys paca_) and capybara. A rare species of bear, the\r\n_Ursus ornatus_ (spectacled bear) is found among the wooded Andean\r\nfoothills. The chinchilla (_C. laniger_), also found in northern\r\nArgentina and Chile, inhabits the colder plateau regions and is prized\r\nfor its fur. The plateau species of the viscacha (_Lagidium cuvieri_)\r\nand the widely distributed South American otter (_Lutra paranensis_) are\r\nalso hunted for their skins. The peccary, which prefers a partially open\r\ncountry, ranges from the Chaco to the densely wooded districts of the\r\nnorth. There are two or three species of deer, the most common being the\r\nlarge marsh deer of the Chaco; but the deer are not numerous. The\r\narmadillo, opossum, ferret and skunk are widely distributed. The\r\namphibia are well represented throughout the lower tropical districts.\r\nAlligators are found in the tributaries of the Paraguay and their\r\nlagoons, lizards and turtles are numerous, and the batrachians are\r\nrepresented by several species. Snakes are also numerous, including\r\nrattlesnakes and the great boa-constrictors of the Amazon region.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of all the Bolivian animals, however, are the\r\nguanaco (_Auchenia huanaco_) and its congeners, the llama (_A. llama_),\r\nalpaca (_A. pacos_) and vicuna (_A. vicugna_), belonging to the\r\nCamelidae, with the structure and habits of the African camel, but\r\nsmaller, having no hump, and inhabiting a mountainous and not a level\r\nsandy region. They are able to go without food and drink for long\r\nperiods, and inhabit the arid and semi-arid plateaus of the Andes and\r\nthe steppes of Patagonia. The guanaco is supposed to be the original\r\ntype, is the largest of the four, and has the greatest range from Peru\r\nto Tierra del Fuego. The llama and alpaca were domesticated long before\r\nthe discovery of America, but the guanaco and vicuna are found in a wild\r\nstate only. The llama is used as a pack animal in Bolivia and Peru, and\r\nits coarse wool is used in the making of garments for the natives. The\r\nalpaca is highly prized for its fine wool, which is a staple export from\r\nBolivia, but the animal is reared with difficulty and the product cannot\r\nbe largely increased. The vicuna also is celebrated for its wool, which\r\nthe natives weave into beautiful and costly _ponchos_ (blanket cloaks)\r\nand other wearing apparel. The guanaco is hunted for its skin, which,\r\nwhen dressed, makes an attractive rug or robe. The slaughter of the\r\nguanaco and vicuna is rapidly diminishing their number. The rearing of\r\nllamas and alpacas is a recognized industry in the Bolivian highlands\r\nand is wholly in the hands of the Indians, who alone seem to understand\r\nthe habits and peculiarities of these interesting animals.\r\n\r\nOf birds and insects the genera and species are very numerous and\r\ninteresting. The high sierras are frequented by condors and eagles of\r\nthe largest size, and the whole country by the common vulture, while the\r\nAmerican ostrich (_Rhea americanus_) and a species of large stork (the\r\n_bata_ or _jaburu_, _Mycteria americana_; maximum height, 8 ft.; spread\r\nof wings, 8 ft. 6 in.) inhabit the tropical plains and valleys.\r\nWaterfowl are numerous and the forests of the warm valleys are filled\r\nwith song-birds and birds of beautiful plumage. Many species of\r\nhumming-birds are found even far up in the mountains, and great numbers\r\nof parrots, araras and toucans, beautiful of feather but harsh of voice,\r\nenliven the forests of the lowlands.\r\n\r\nLike other South American states, Bolivia benefited greatly from the\r\nintroduction of European animals. Horses, cattle, sheep, goats, swine\r\nand poultry were introduced, and are now sources of food and wealth to a\r\nlarge part of the population. Mules are used to a large extent as pack\r\nanimals, but they are imported from Argentina. Silkworms have been bred\r\nwith success in some departments, and the cochineal insect is found\r\nwherever the conditions are favourable for the cactus.\r\n\r\n_Flora._--Owing to the diversities in altitude the flora of Bolivia\r\nrepresents every climatic zone, from the scanty Arctic vegetation of the\r\nlofty Cordilleras to the luxuriant tropical forests of the Amazon basin.\r\nBetween these extremes the diversity in vegetable life is as great as\r\nthat of climate and soil. The flora of Bolivia has been studied less\r\nthan the flora of the neighbouring republics, however, because of the\r\ninaccessibility of these inland regions. Among the more important\r\nproductions, the potato, oca (_Oxalis tuberosa_), quinoa (_Chenopodium\r\nquinoa_) and some coarse grasses characterize the puna region, while\r\nbarley, an exotic, is widely grown for fodder. Indian corn was\r\ncultivated in the temperate and warm regions long before the advent of\r\nEuropeans, who introduced wheat, rye, oats, beans, pease and the fruits\r\nand vegetables of the Old World, for each of which a favourable soil and\r\nclimate was easily found. In the sub-tropical and tropical zones the\r\nindigenous plants are the sweet potato, cassava (_Manihot utilissima_\r\nand _M. aipi_), peanuts, pineapple, guava, chirimoya (_Anona\r\ncherimolia_), pawpaw (_Carica papaya_), _ipecacuanha_ (_Cephaelis_),\r\nsarsaparilla, vanilla, false jalap (_Mirabilis jalapa_), copaiba, tolu\r\n(_Myroxylon toluiferum_), rubber-producing trees, dyewoods, cotton and\r\na great number of beautiful hardwoods, such as jacaranda, mahogany,\r\nrosewood, quebracho, colo, cedar, walnut, &c. Among the fruits many of\r\nthe most common are exotics, as the orange, lemon, lime, fig, date,\r\ngrape, &c., while others, as the banana, caju or cashew (_Anacardium\r\noccidentale_) and aguacate avocado or alligator pear, have a disputed\r\norigin. Coca, one of the most important plants of the country, is\r\ncultivated on the eastern slopes of the Andes at an altitude of 5000 to\r\n6000 ft., where the temperature is uniform and frosts are unknown. Quina\r\nor calisaya is a natural product of the eastern Andes, and is found at\r\nan altitude of 3000 to 9000 ft. above sea-level. The calisaya trees of\r\nBolivia rank among the best, and their bark forms an important item in\r\nher foreign trade. The destructive methods of collecting the bark are\r\nsteadily diminishing the natural sources of supply, and experiments in\r\ncinchona cultivation were undertaken during the last quarter of the 19th\r\ncentury, with fair prospects of success. The most important of the\r\nindigenous forest products, however, is rubber, derived principally from\r\nthe _Hevea guayanensis_ (var. _brasiliensis_), growing along the river\r\ncourses in the _yungas_ regions of the north, though Manicoba rubber is\r\nalso obtained from _Manihot Glaziovii_ on the drier uplands. Among the\r\nexotics, sugar-cane, rice and tobacco are cultivated in the warm\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\n_Population._--The population of Bolivia is composed of Indians,\r\nCaucasians of European origin, and a mixture of the two races, generally\r\ndescribed as _mestizos_. There is also a very small percentage of\r\nAfricans, descendants of the negro slaves introduced in colonial times.\r\nA roughly-taken census of 1900 gives the total population as 1,816,271,\r\nincluding the Litoral department, now belonging to Chile (49,820), and\r\nestimates the number of wild Indians of the forest regions at 91,000. Of\r\nthis total, 50.7% were classed as Indians, 12.8% as whites, 26.8% as\r\n_mestizos_, 0.3% as negroes, and 9.4% as unknown. In 1904 an official\r\nestimate made the population 2,181,415, also including the Litoral\r\n(59,784), but of course all census returns and estimates in such a\r\ncountry are subject to many allowances. The Indian population (920,860)\r\nis largely composed of the so-called civilized tribes of the Andes,\r\nwhich once formed part of the nationality ruled by the Incas, and of\r\nthose of the Mojos and Chiquitos regions, which were organized into\r\nindustrial communities by the Jesuits in the l7th century. The former,\r\nwhich are chiefly Aymaras south of the latitude of Lake Titicaca,\r\nattained a considerable degree of civilization before the discovery of\r\nAmerica and have been in closer contact with Europeans than the other\r\ntribes of Bolivia. It is doubtful, however, whether their condition has\r\nbeen improved under these influences. The Mojos and Chiquitos tribes,\r\nalso, have been less prosperous since the expulsion of the Jesuits, but\r\nthey have remained together in organized communities, and have followed\r\nthe industries and preserved the religion taught them as well as\r\ncircumstances permitted. Both these groups of Indians are peaceable and\r\nindustrious, and form an important labouring element. They are addicted\r\nto the excessive use of _chica_ (a native beer made from Indian corn),\r\nand have little or no ambition to improve their condition, but this may\r\nbe attributed in part to their profound ignorance and to the state of\r\npeonage in which they are held. Inhabiting the southern part of the\r\nBolivian plain are the Chiriguanos, a detached tribe of the Guarani race\r\nwhich drifted westward to the vicinity of the Andes long ago. They are\r\nof a superior physical and mental type, and have made noteworthy\r\nprogress toward civilization. They are agriculturists and stock-raisers\r\nand have the reputation of being peaceable and industrious. The\r\nremaining native tribes under the supervision of the state have made\r\nlittle progress, and their number is said to be decreasing\r\n(notwithstanding the favourable climatic conditions under which most of\r\nthem live) because of unsanitary and intemperate habits, and for other\r\ncauses not well understood, one being the custom noticed by early\r\ntravellers among some of the tribes of the La Plata region of avoiding\r\nthe rearing of children. (See Southey's _History of Brazil_, iii. pp.\r\n402, 673.) Of the wild Indians very little is known in regard to either\r\nnumbers or customs.\r\n\r\nThe white population (231,088) is descended in great part from the early\r\nSpanish adventurers who entered the country in search of mineral wealth.\r\nTo these have been added a small number of Spanish Americans from\r\nneighbouring republics and some Portuguese Americans from Brazil. There\r\nhas been no direct immigration from Europe, though Europeans of various\r\nnationalities have found their way into the country and settled there as\r\nminers or traders. The percentage of whites therefore does not increase\r\nas in Argentina and Brazil, and cannot until means are found to promote\r\nEuropean immigration.\r\n\r\nThe _mestizos_ (486,018) are less numerous than the Indians, but\r\noutnumber the whites by more than two to one. It has been said of the\r\n_mestizos_ elsewhere that they inherit the vices of both races and the\r\nvirtues of neither. Yet, with a decreasing Indian population, and with a\r\nwhite population wanting in energy, barely able to hold its own and\r\ncomprising only one-eighth of the total, the future of Bolivia mainly\r\ndepends on them. As a rule they are ignorant, unprogressive and\r\napathetic, intensely superstitious, cruel and intemperate, though\r\nindividual strong characters have been produced. It may be that\r\neducation and experience will develop the _mestizos_ into a vigorous\r\nprogressive nationality, but the first century of self-government can\r\nhardly be said to have given much promise of such a result.\r\n\r\n_Divisions and Towns._--The republic is divided into eight departments\r\nand one territory, and these are subdivided into 54 provinces, 415\r\ncantons, 232 vice-cantons, 18 missions and one colony. The names, areas\r\nand populations of the departments, with their capitals, according to\r\nthe census of 1900, to which corrections must be made on account of the\r\nloss of territory to Brazil in 1903, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  +----------------+-------------+----------+--------------+----------+\r\n  |                | Area sq. m. |Population|              |Population|\r\n  |   Department.  |from Official| 1900.[*] |   Capitals.  |   1900.  |\r\n  |                |  Sources.   |          |              |          |\r\n  +----------------+-------------+----------+--------------+----------+\r\n  | La Paz         |    53,777   |  445,616 | La Paz       |  54,713  |\r\n  | El Beni        |   102,111   |   32,180 | Trinidad     |   2,556  |\r\n  | Oruro          |    19,127   |   86,081 | Oruro        |  13,575  |\r\n  | Cochabamba     |    23,328   |  328,163 | Cochabamba   |  21,886  |\r\n  | Santa Cruz     |   141,368   |  209,592 | Santa Cruz de|  15,874  |\r\n  |                |             |          |   la Sierra  |          |\r\n  | Potosi         |    48,801   |  325,615 | Potosi       |  20,910  |\r\n  | Chuquisaca     |    26,418   |  204,434 | Sucre        |  20,967  |\r\n  | Tarija         |    33,036   |  102,887 | Tarija       |   6,980  |\r\n  | Nat.

Four of these capitals--Sucre or Chuquisaca, La Paz,\r\nCochabamba and Oruro--have served as the national capital, and Sucre was\r\nchosen, but after the revolution of 1898 the capital was at La Paz,\r\nwhich is the commercial metropolis and is more accessible than Sucre.\r\nAmong the smaller towns prominent because of an industry or commercial\r\nposition, may be mentioned the Huanchaca mining centre of Pulacayo (pop.\r\n6512), where 3200 men are employed in the mines and surface works of\r\nthis great silver mining company; Uyuni (pop. 1587), the junction of the\r\nPulacayo branch with the Antofagasta and Oruro railway, and also the\r\nconverging point for several important highways and projected railways;\r\nand Tupiza (pop. 1644), a commercial and mining centre near the\r\nArgentine frontier, and the terminus of the Argentine railway extension\r\ninto Bolivia. All these towns are in the department of Potosi. Viacha\r\n(pop. 1670), a small station on the railway from Guaqui to Alto de La\r\nPaz, 14 m. from the latter, is the starting point of an important\r\nprojected railway to Oruro. In the department of Cochabamba, Tarata\r\n(4681) and Totora (3501) are two important trading centres, and in the\r\ndepartment of Santa Cruz, Ascension (pop. 4784) is a large mission\r\nstation in the Chiquitos hills.\r\n\r\n_Communications._--Under a treaty with Brazil in 1903 and with Chile in\r\n1904 (ratified 1905) provisions were made for railway construction in\r\nBolivia to bring this isolated region into more effective communication\r\nwith the outside world. Brazil agreed to construct a railway around the\r\nfalls of the Madeira (about 180 m. long) to give north-eastern Bolivia\r\naccess to the Amazon, and paid down L2,000,000 in cash which Bolivia was\r\nto expend on railway construction within her own territory. Chile also\r\nagreed to construct a railway from Arica to La Paz, 295 m. (the Bolivian\r\nsection becoming the property of Bolivia fifteen years after\r\ncompletion), and to pay the interest (not over 5%) which Bolivia might\r\nguarantee on the capital invested in certain interior railways if\r\nconstructed within thirty years, providing these interest payments\r\nshould not exceed L100,000 a year, nor exceed L1,600,000 in the\r\naggregate. Argentina had already undertaken to extend her northern\r\nrailway from Jujuy to the Bolivian frontier town of Tupiza, and the\r\nPeruvian Corporation had constructed for the Bolivian government a short\r\nline (54 m. long) from Guaqui, on Lake Titicaca, to Alto de La Paz,\r\nwhich is connected with the city of La Paz, 1493 ft. below, by an\r\nelectric line 5 m. long. This line gives La Paz access to the Peruvian\r\nport of Mollendo, 496 m. distant, and promises in time to give it\r\nrailway communication with Cuzco. Rivalry for the control of her trade,\r\ntherefore, promises to give Bolivia the railways needed for the\r\ndevelopment of her resources. Up to 1903 the only railways in Bolivia\r\nwere the Antofagasta and Oruro line, with a total length of 574 m., of\r\nwhich 350 m. are within Bolivian territory, a private branch of that\r\nline (26 m. long) running to the Pulacayo mines, and the line (54 m.\r\nlong) from Guaqui to Alto de La Paz--a total of only 430 m. As a result\r\nof her war with Chile in 1878-81, the railways (282 m. long) of her\r\nLitoral department passed under Chilean control. Lines were in 1907\r\nprojected from La Paz to the navigable waters of the Beni, from La Paz\r\nto Cochabamba, from Viacha to Oruro, from Uyuni to Potosi and Sucre,\r\nfrom Uyuni to Tupiza, and from Arica to La Paz via Corocoro. The central\r\nnorthern line of the Argentine government was completed to the Bolivian\r\nfrontier in 1908, and this line was designed to extend to Tupiza. The\r\nundertaking of the Arica-La Paz line by the Chilean government, also,\r\nwas an important step towards the improvement of the economic situation\r\nin Bolivia. Both these lines offer the country new outlets for its\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nPublic highways have been constructed between the large cities and to\r\nsome points on the frontiers, and subsidized stage coaches are run on\r\nsome of them. The roads are rough and at times almost impassable,\r\nhowever, and the river crossings difficult and dangerous. The large\r\ncities are connected with one another by telegraph lines and are in\r\ncommunication with the outside world through Argentina, Chile and Peru.\r\nTelegraph service dates from 1880, and in 1904 there were 3115 m. in\r\noperation, of which 1936 belonged to the state and 1179 to private\r\ncorporations. The latter includes the lines belonging to the Antofagasta\r\nand Oruro railway, which are partly within Chilean territory. Bolivia is\r\na member of the International Postal Union, and has parcel and money\r\norder conventions with some foreign countries. Special agreements have\r\nbeen made, also, with Argentina, Chile and Peru for the transmission of\r\nthe Bolivian foreign mails.\r\n\r\nThe loss of her maritime department has left Bolivia with no other ports\r\nthan those of Lake Titicaca (especially Guaqui, or Huaqui, which trades\r\nwith the Peruvian port of Puno), and those of the Madeira and Paraguay\r\nrivers and their affluents. As none of these can be reached without\r\ntranshipment in foreign territory, the cost of transport is increased,\r\nand her neighbours are enabled to exclude Bolivia from direct commercial\r\nintercourse with other nations. An exception formerly existed at Puerto\r\nAcre, on the Acre river, to which ocean-going steamers could ascend from\r\nPara, but Brazil first closed the Purus and Acre rivers to foreign\r\nvessels seeking this port, and then under a treaty of 1903 acquired\r\npossession of the port and adjacent territory. Since then Bolivia's\r\noutlet to the Amazon is restricted to the Madeira river, the navigation\r\nof which is interrupted by a series of falls before Bolivian territory\r\nis reached. The Bolivian port of entry for this trade, Villa Bella, is\r\nsituated above the falls of the Madeira at the confluence of the Beni\r\nand Mamore, and is reached from the lower river by a long and costly\r\nportage. It is also shut off from the navigable rivers above by the\r\nfalls of the Beni and Mamore. The railway to be built by Brazil will\r\nremedy this unfavourable situation, will afford a better outlet for\r\nnorth-eastern Bolivia, and should promote a more rapid development of\r\nthat region, which is covered with an admirable system of navigable\r\nrivers above the falls of the Beni and Mamore. Connected with the upper\r\nParaguay are Puerto Pacheco on Bahia Negra, Puerto Suarez (about 1600 m.\r\nfrom Buenos Aires by river), on Lake Caceres, through which passes the\r\nbulk of Bolivian trade in that direction, and Puerto Quijarro, on Lake\r\nGaiba, a projected port said to be more accessible than any other in\r\nthis region. Whenever the trade of southern Bolivia becomes important\r\nenough to warrant the expense of opening a navigable channel in the\r\nPilcomayo, direct river communication with Buenos Aires and Montevideo\r\nwill be possible.\r\n\r\n_Industries._--Stock-raising was one of the earliest industries of the\r\ncountry after that of mining. Horses, formerly successfully raised in\r\ncertain parts of the north, have not flourished there since the\r\nintroduction of a _peste_ from Brazil, but some are now raised in La Paz\r\nand other departments of the temperate region. The Jesuit founders of\r\nthe Mojos missions took cattle with them when they entered that region\r\nto labour among the Indians, with the result that the Mojos and\r\nChiquitos llanos were soon well stocked, and have since afforded an\r\nunfailing supply of beef for the neighbouring inland markets. Their\r\ninaccessibility and the costs of transportation have prevented a\r\ndevelopment of the industry and a consequent improvement in stock, but\r\nthe persistency of the industry under conditions so unfavourable is\r\nevidence that the soil and climate are suited to its requirements.\r\nFarther south the llanos of Chuquisaca and Tarija also sustain large\r\nherds of cattle on the more elevated districts, and on the well-watered\r\nplains of the Chaco. There are small districts in La Paz, Potosi and\r\nCochabamba, also, where cattle are raised. Apart from the cattle driven\r\ninto the mining districts for consumption, a number of _saladeros_ are\r\nemployed in preparing (usually salting and sun-drying) beef for the home\r\nmarkets. The hides are exported. Goats are raised in the warm and\r\ntemperate regions, and sheep for their wool in the latter. On the higher\r\nand colder plateaus much attention is given to the breeding of llamas\r\nand alpacas. Another industry of a different character is that of\r\nbreeding the fur-bearing chinchilla (_C. laniger_), which is a native of\r\nthe higher plateaus. The Bolivian government has prohibited the\r\nexportation of the live animals and is encouraging their production.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural resources of the republic are varied and of great\r\nvalue, but their development has been slow and hesitating. The\r\ncultivation of cereals, fruits and vegetables in the temperate and warm\r\nvalleys of the Andes followed closely the mining settlements. Sugar-cane\r\nalso was introduced at an early date, but as the demand for sugar was\r\nlimited the product was devoted chiefly to the manufacture of rum, which\r\nis the principal object of cane cultivation in Bolivia to-day. The\r\nclimatic conditions are highly favourable for this product in eastern\r\nBolivia, but it is heavily taxed and is restricted to a small home\r\nmarket. Rice is another exotic grown in the tropical districts of\r\neastern Bolivia, but the quantity produced is far from sufficient to\r\nmeet local requirements. Tobacco of a fair quality is produced in the\r\nwarm regions of the east, including the _yungas_ valleys of La Paz and\r\nCochabamba; cacao of a superior grade is grown in the department of\r\nBeni, where large orchards were planted at the missions, and also in the\r\nwarm Andean valleys of La Paz and Cochabamba; and coffee of the best\r\nflavour is grown in some of the warmer districts of the eastern Andes.\r\nThe two indigenous products which receive most attention, perhaps, are\r\nthose of quinoa and coca. Quinoa is grown in large quantities, and is a\r\nstaple article of food among the natives. Coca is highly esteemed by\r\nthe natives, who masticate the leaf, and is also an article of export\r\nfor medicinal purposes. It is extensively cultivated in the departments\r\nof Cochabamba and La Paz, especially in the province of Yungas.\r\n\r\nIn the exploitation of her forest products, however, are to be found the\r\nindustries that yield the greatest immediate profit to Bolivia. The most\r\nprominent and profitable of these is that of rubber-collecting, which\r\nwas begun in Bolivia between 1880 and 1890, and which reached a\r\nregistered annual output of nearly 3500 metric tons just before\r\nBolivia's best rubber forests were transferred to Brazil in 1903. There\r\nstill remain extensive areas of forest on the Beni and Madre de Dios in\r\nwhich the rubber-producing _Hevea_ is to be found. Although representing\r\nless value in the aggregate, the collecting of cinchona bark is one of\r\nthe oldest forest industries of Bolivia, which is said still to have\r\nlarge areas of virgin forest to draw upon. The Bolivian product is of\r\nthe best because of the high percentage of quinine sulphate which it\r\nyields. The industry is destructive in method, and the area of cinchona\r\nforests is steadily diminishing. Many other Bolivian plants are\r\ncommercially valuable, and organized industry and trade in them will\r\ncertainly be profitable.\r\n\r\nThe industrial activities of the Bolivian people are still of a very\r\nprimitive character. An act was passed in 1894 authorizing the\r\ngovernment to offer premiums and grant advantageous concessions for the\r\ndevelopment of manufacturing industries, especially in sugar production,\r\nbut conditions have not been favourable and the results have been\r\ndisappointing. Spinning and weaving are carried on among the people as a\r\nhousehold occupation, and fabrics are made of an exceptionally\r\nsubstantial character. It is not uncommon to see the natives busily\r\ntwirling their rude spindles as they follow their troops of pack animals\r\nover rough mountain roads, and the yarn produced is woven into cloth in\r\ntheir own houses on rough Spanish looms of colonial patterns. Not only\r\nis coarse cloth for their own garments made in this manner from the\r\nfleece of the llama, but cotton and woollen goods of a serviceable\r\ncharacter are manufactured, and still finer fabrics are woven from the\r\nwool of the alpaca and vicuna, sometimes mixed with silk or lamb's wool.\r\nThe Indian women are expert weavers, and their handiwork often commands\r\nhigh prices. In the Mojos and Chiquitos districts the natives were\r\ntaught by the Jesuit missionaries to weave an excellent cotton cloth,\r\nand the industry still exists. Cashmere, baize, waterproof _ponchos_ of\r\nfine wool and silk, and many other fabrics are made by the Indians of\r\nthe Andean departments. They are skilled in the use of dyes, and the\r\nIndian women pride themselves on a large number of finely-woven,\r\nbrilliantly-coloured petticoats. Tanning and saddlery are carried on by\r\nthe natives with primitive methods, but with excellent results. They are\r\nskilful in the preparation of lap robes and rugs from the skins of the\r\nalpaca and vicuna. The home markets are supplied, by native industry,\r\nwith cigars and cigarettes, soap, candles, hats, gloves, starch, cheese\r\nand pottery. Sugar is still made in the old way, and there is a small\r\nproduction of wine and silk in certain districts. No country is better\r\nsupplied with water power, and electric lighting and electric power\r\nplants have been established at La Paz.\r\n\r\n_Commerce._--The foreign trade of Bolivia is comparatively unimportant,\r\nbut the statistical returns are incomplete and unsatisfactory; the\r\nimports of 1904 aggregated only L1,734,551 in value, and the exports\r\nonly L1,851,758. The imports consisted of cottons, woollens, live-stock,\r\nprovisions, hardware and machinery, wines, spirits and clothing. The\r\nprincipal exports were (in 1903) silver and its ores (L636,743), tin and\r\nits ores (L1,039,298), copper ores (L157,609), bismuth (L16,354), other\r\nminerals (L20,948), rubber (L260,559), coca (L28,907), and cinchona\r\n(L9197)--total exports, L2,453,638. These figures, however, do not\r\ncorrectly represent the aggregates of Bolivian trade, as her imports and\r\nexports passing through Antofagasta, Arica and Mollendo are to a large\r\nextent credited to Chile and Peru. The import trade of Bolivia is\r\nrestricted by the poverty of the people. The geographical position\r\nlimits the exports to mineral, forest and some pastoral products, owing\r\nto cost of transportation and the tariffs of neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\n_Government._--The government of Bolivia is a \"unitarian\" or centralized\r\nrepublic, representative in form, but autocratic in some important\r\nparticulars. The constitution in force (1908) was adopted on the 28th of\r\nOctober 1880, and is a model in form and profession. The executive\r\nbranch of the government is presided over by a president and two\r\nvice-presidents, who are elected by direct popular vote for a period of\r\nfour years, and are not eligible for re-election for the next succeeding\r\nterm. The president is assisted by a cabinet of five ministers of state,\r\nviz.: foreign relations and worship; finance and industry; interior and\r\nfomento; justice and public instruction; war and colonization. Every\r\nexecutive act must be countersigned by a minister of state, who is held\r\nresponsible for its character and enforcement, and may be prosecuted\r\nbefore the supreme court for its illegality and effects. The legislative\r\nbranch is represented by a national congress of two houses--a Senate and\r\nChamber of Deputies. The Senate is composed of 16 members, two from each\r\ndepartment, who are elected by direct popular vote for a period of six\r\nyears, one-third retiring every two years. The Chamber of Deputies is\r\ncomposed of 72 members, who are elected for a period of four years,\r\none-half retiring every two years. In impeachment trials the Chamber\r\nprosecutes and the Senate sits as a court, as in the United States. One\r\nof the duties of the Chamber is to elect the justices of the supreme\r\ncourt. Congress meets annually and its sessions are for sixty days,\r\nwhich may be extended to ninety days. The chambers have separate and\r\nconcurrent powers defined by the constitution. The right of suffrage is\r\nexercised by all male citizens, twenty-one years of age, or over, if\r\nsingle, and eighteen years, or over, if married, who can read and write,\r\nand own real estate or have an income of 200 bolivianos a year, said\r\nincome not to be compensation for services as a servant. The electoral\r\nbody is therefore small, and is under the control of a political\r\noligarchy which practically rules the country, no matter which party is\r\nin power.\r\n\r\nThe Bolivian judiciary consists of a national supreme court, eight\r\nsuperior district courts, lower district courts, and _juzgados de\r\ninstruccion_ for the investigation and preparation of cases. The\r\n_corregidores_ and _alcaldes_ also exercise the functions of a justice\r\nof the peace in the cantons and rural districts. The supreme court is\r\ncomposed of seven justices elected by the Chamber of Deputies from lists\r\nof three names for each seat sent in by the Senate. A justice can be\r\nremoved only by impeachment proceedings before the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe supreme administration in each department is vested in a prefect\r\nappointed by and responsible solely to the president. As the prefect has\r\nthe appointment of subordinate department officials, including the\r\n_alcaldes_, the authority of the national executive reaches every hamlet\r\nin the republic, and may easily become autocratic. There are no\r\nlegislative assemblies in the departments, and their government rests\r\nwith the national executive and congress. Subordinate to the prefects\r\nare the sub-prefects in the provinces, the _corregidores_ in the cantons\r\nand the _alcaldes_ in the rural districts--all appointed officials. The\r\nnational territory adjacent to Brazil and Peru is governed by two\r\n_delegados nacionales_, appointees of the president. The department\r\ncapitals are provided with municipal councils which have jurisdiction\r\nover certain local affairs, and over the construction and maintenance of\r\nsome of the highways.\r\n\r\n_Army._--The military forces of the republic in 1905 included 2890\r\nregulars and an enrolled force of 80,000 men, divided into a first\r\nreserve of 30,000, a second reserve of 40,000, and 10,000 territorial\r\nguards. The enrolled force is, however, both unorganized and unarmed.\r\nThe strength of the army is fixed in each year's budget. That for 1903\r\nconsisted of 2933 officers and men, of which 275 were commissioned and\r\n558 non-commissioned officers, 181 musicians, and only 1906 rank and\r\nfile. A conscription law of 1894 provides for a compulsory military\r\nservice between the ages of twenty-one and fifty years, with two years'\r\nactual service in the regulars for those between twenty-one and\r\ntwenty-five, but the law is practically a dead letter. There is a\r\nmilitary school with 60 cadets, and an arsenal at La Paz.\r\n\r\n_Education._--Although Bolivia has a free and compulsory school system,\r\neducation and the provision for education have made little progress.\r\nOnly a small percentage of the people can read and write. Although\r\nSpanish is the language of the dominant minority, Quichua, Aymara and\r\nGuarani are the languages of the natives, who form a majority of the\r\npopulation. A considerable percentage of the Indians do not understand\r\nSpanish at all, and they even resist every effort to force it upon them.\r\nEven the _cholos_ (mestizos) are more familiar with the native idioms\r\nthan with Spanish, as is the case in some parts of Argentina and\r\nParaguay. According to official estimates for 1901, the total number of\r\nprimary schools in the republic was 733, with 938 teachers and 41,587\r\npupils--the total cost of their maintenance being estimated at 585,365\r\nbolivianos, or only 14.07 bolivianos per pupil (about L1:4:6). The\r\nschool enrolment was only one in 43.7 of population, compared with one\r\nin 10 for Argentina. The schools are largely under the control of the\r\nmunicipalities, though nearly half of them are maintained by the\r\nnational government, by the Church and by private means. There were in\r\nthe same year 13 institutions of secondary and 14 of superior\r\ninstruction. The latter include so-called universities at Sucre\r\n(Chuquisaca), La Paz, Cochabamba, Tarija, Potosi, Santa Cruz and\r\nOruro--all of which give instruction in law, the first three in medicine\r\nand the first four in theology. The university at Sucre, which dates\r\nfrom colonial times, and that at La Paz, are the only ones on the list\r\nsufficiently well equipped to merit the title. Secondary instruction is\r\nunder the control of the universities, and public instruction in general\r\nis under the direction of a cabinet minister. All educational matters,\r\nhowever, are practically under the supervision of the Church. The total\r\nappropriation for educational purposes in 1901 was 756,943 bolivianos,\r\nor L66,232:6s. There are a military academy at La Paz, an agricultural\r\nschool at Umala in the department of La Paz, a mining and civil\r\nengineering school at Oruro, commercial schools at Sucre and Trinidad,\r\nand several mission schools under the direction of religious orders.\r\n\r\n_Religion._--The constitution of Bolivia, art. 2, defines the attitude\r\nof the republic toward the Church in the following words:--\"The state\r\nrecognizes and supports the Roman Apostolic Catholic religion, the\r\npublic exercise of any other worship being prohibited, except in the\r\ncolonies where it is tolerated.\" This toleration is tacitly extended to\r\nresident foreigners belonging to other religious sects. The census of\r\n1900 enumerated the Roman Catholic population at 1,609,365, and that of\r\nother creeds at 24,245, which gives the former 985 and the latter 15 in\r\nevery thousand. The domesticated Indians profess the Roman Catholic\r\nfaith, but it is tinged with the superstitions of their ancestors. They\r\nhold the clergy in great fear and reverence, however, and are deeply\r\ninfluenced by the forms and ceremonies of the church, which have changed\r\nlittle since the first Spanish settlements. Bolivia is divided into an\r\narchbishopric and three bishoprics. The first includes the departments\r\nof Chuquisaca, Oruro, Potosi, Tarija and the Chilean province of\r\nAntofagasta, with its seat at Sucre, and is known as the archbishopric\r\nof La Plata. The sees of the three bishoprics are La Paz, Cochabamba and\r\nSanta Cruz. Mission work among the Indians is entrusted to the\r\n_Propaganda Fide_, which has five colleges and a large number of\r\nmissions, and receives a small subvention from the state. It is\r\nestimated that these missions have charge of fully 20,000 Indians. The\r\nannual appropriation for the Church is about L17,150. The religious\r\norders, which have never been suppressed in Bolivia, maintain several\r\nconvents.\r\n\r\n_Finance._--No itemized returns of receipts and expenditures are ever\r\npublished, and the estimates presented to congress by the cabinet\r\nministers furnish the only source from which information can be drawn.\r\nThe expenditures are not large, and taxation is not considered heavy.\r\nThe estimated revenues and expenditures for 1904 and 1905 at 21 pence\r\nper boliviano, were as follows: 1904, revenue L632,773:15s., expenditure\r\nL748,571:10s.; 1905, revenue L693,763:17:6, expenditure L828,937:19:9.\r\nThe revenues are derived principally from duties and fees on imports,\r\nexcise taxes on spirits, wines, tobacco and sugar, general, mining\r\ntaxes and export duties on minerals (except silver), export duties on\r\nrubber and coca, taxes on the profits of stock companies, fees for\r\nlicences and patents, stamp taxes, and postal and telegraph revenues.\r\nNominally, the import duties are moderate, so much so that Bolivia is\r\nsometimes called a \"free-trade country,\" but this is a misnomer, for in\r\naddition to the schedule rates of 10 to 40% _ad valorem_ on imports,\r\nthere are a consular fee of 1-1/2% for the registration of invoices\r\nexceeding 200 bolivianos, a consumption tax of 10 centavos per quintal\r\n(46 kilogrammes), fees for viseing certificates to accompany merchandise\r\nin transit, special \"octroi\" taxes on certain kinds of merchandise\r\ncontrolled by monopolies (spirits, tobacco, &c.), and the import and\r\nconsumption taxes levied by the departments and municipalities. The\r\nexpenditures are chiefly for official salaries, subsidies, public works,\r\nchurch and mission support, justice, public instruction, military\r\nexpenses, and interest on the public debt. The appropriations for 1905\r\nwere as follows: war, 2,081,119 bolivianos; finance and industry,\r\n1,462,259; government and fomento, 2,021,428; justice and public\r\ninstruction, 1,878,941.\r\n\r\nThe acknowledged public debt of the country is comparatively small. At\r\nthe close of the war with Chile there was an indemnity debt due to\r\ncitizens of that republic of 6,550,830 bolivianos, which had been nearly\r\nliquidated in 1904 when Chile took over the unpaid balance. This was\r\nBolivia's only foreign debt. In 1905 her internal debt, including\r\n1,998,500 bolivianos of treasury bills, amounted to 6,243,270 bolivianos\r\n(L546,286). The government in 1903 authorized the issue of treasury\r\nnotes for the department of Beni and the National Territory to the\r\namount of one million bolivianos (L87,500), for the redemption of which\r\n10% of the customs receipts of the two districts is set apart. The paper\r\ncurrency of the republic consists of bank-notes issued by four private\r\nbanks, and is therefore no part of the public debt. The amount in\r\ncirculation on the 30th of June 1903 was officially estimated at\r\n9,144,254 bolivianos (L800,122), issued on a par with silver. The\r\ncoinage of the country is of silver, nickel and copper. The silver coins\r\nare of the denominations of 1 boliviano, or 100 centavos, 50, 20, 10 and\r\n5 centavos, and the issue of these coins from the Potosi mint is said to\r\nbe about 1,500,000 bolivianos a year. The silver mining companies are\r\nrequired by law to send to the mint 20% of their product. The silver\r\nboliviano, however, is rarely seen in circulation because of the cheaper\r\npaper currency. To check the exportation of silver coin, the fractional\r\ndenominations have been slightly debased. The nickel coins are of 5 and\r\n10 centavos, and the copper 1 and 2 centavos.\r\n\r\nThe departmental revenues, which are derived from excise and land taxes,\r\nmining grants, tithes, inheritance taxes, tolls, stamp taxes, subsidies\r\nfrom the national treasury and other small taxes, were estimated at\r\n2,296,172 bolivianos in 1903, and the expenditures at 2,295,791\r\nbolivianos. The expenditures were chiefly for justice, police, public\r\nworks, public instruction and the Church. The municipal revenues\r\naggregated 2,317,670 bolivianos in 1902, and the expenditures 61,510\r\nbolivianos in excess of that sum. These revenues are derived from a\r\nlighting tax, leases and ground rents, cemetery fees, consumption and\r\nmarket taxes, licences, tolls, taxes on hides and skins, personal and\r\nvarious minor taxes. There is a multiplication of taxes in trade which\r\nrecalls the old colonial _alcabala_ tax, and it serves to restrict\r\ncommerce and augment the cost of goods in much the same way, if not to\r\nthe same degree.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--M.V.

L.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\n\r\nThe country now forming the republic of Bolivia, named after the great\r\nliberator Simon Bolivar (q.v.), was in early days simply a portion of\r\nthe empire of the Incas of Peru (q.v.). After the conquest of Peru by\r\nthe Spaniards in the 16th century the natives were subjected to much\r\ntyranny and oppression, though it must in fairness be said that much of\r\nit was carried out in defiance of the efforts and the wishes of the\r\nSpanish home government, whose legislative efforts to protect the\r\nIndians from serfdom and ill-usage met with scant respect at the hands\r\nof the distant settlers and mine-owners, who bid defiance to the humane\r\nand protective regulations of the council of the Indies, and treated the\r\nunhappy natives little better than beasts of burden. The statement,\r\nmoreover, that some eight millions of Indians perished through forced\r\nlabour in the mines is a gross exaggeration. The annual diminution in\r\nthe number of the Indian population was undoubtedly very great, but it\r\nwas due far more to the result of European epidemics and to indulgence\r\nin alcohol than to hard work. The abortive insurrection of 1780-82, led\r\nby the Inca Tupac Amaru, was never a general rising, and was directed\r\nrather against Creole tyranny than against Spanish rule. The heavy\r\nlosses sustained by the Indians during that outbreak, and their dislike\r\nand distrust of the colonial Spaniard, account for the comparative\r\nindifference with which they viewed the rise and progress of the 1814\r\ncolonial revolt against Spain, which gave the South American states\r\ntheir independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n  War of Independence.\r\n\r\nWe are only concerned here with the War of Independence so far as it\r\naffected Upper Peru, the Bolivia of later days. When the patriots of\r\nBuenos Aires had succeeded in liberating from the dominion of Spain the\r\ninterior provinces of the Rio de la Plata, they turned their arms\r\nagainst their enemies who held Upper Peru. An almost uninterrupted\r\nwarfare followed, from July 1809 till August 1825, with alternate\r\nsuccesses on the side of the Spanish or royalist and the South American\r\nor patriot forces,--the scene of action lying chiefly between the\r\nArgentine provinces of Salta and Jujuy and the shores of Lake Titicaca.\r\nThe first movement of the war was the successful invasion of Upper Peru\r\nby the army of Buenos Aires, under General Balcarce, which, after twice\r\ndefeating the Spanish troops, was able to celebrate the first\r\nanniversary of independence near Lake Titicaca, in May 1811. Soon,\r\nhowever, the patriot army, owing to the dissolute conduct and negligence\r\nof its leaders, became disorganized, and was attacked and defeated, in\r\nJune 1811, by the Spanish army under Gey fol Goyeneche, and driven back\r\ninto Jujuy. Four years of warfare, in which victory was alternately\r\nwith the Spaniards and the patriots, was terminated in 1815 by the total\r\nrout of the latter in a battle which took place between Potosi and\r\nOruro. To this succeeded a revolt of the Indians of the southern\r\nprovinces of Peru, and the object being the independence of the whole\r\ncountry, it was joined by numerous Creoles. This insurrection was,\r\nhowever, speedily put down by the royalists. In 1816 the Spanish general\r\nLaserna, having been appointed commander-in-chief of Upper Peru, made an\r\nattempt to invade the Argentine provinces, intending to march on Buenos\r\nAires, but he was completely foiled in this by the activity of the\r\nirregular _gaucho_ troops of Salta and Jujuy, and was forced to retire.\r\nDuring this time and in the six succeeding years a guerrilla warfare was\r\nmaintained by the patriots of Upper Peru, who had taken refuge in the\r\nmountains, chiefly of the province of Yungas, and who frequently\r\nharassed the royalist troops. In June 1823 the expedition of General\r\nSanta Cruz, prepared with great zeal and activity at Lima, marched in\r\ntwo divisions upon Upper Peru, and in the following months of July and\r\nAugust the whole country between La Paz and Oruro was occupied by his\r\nforces; but later, the indecision and want of judgment displayed by\r\nSanta Cruz allowed a retreat to be made before a smaller royalist army,\r\nand a severe storm converted their retreat into a precipitate flight,\r\nonly a remnant of the expedition again reaching Lima. In 1824, after the\r\ngreat battle of Ayacucho in Lower Peru, General Sucre, whose valour had\r\ncontributed so much to the patriot success of that day, marched with a\r\npart of the victorious army into Upper Peru. On the news of the victory\r\na universal rising of the patriots took place, and before Sucre had\r\nreached Oruro and Puno, in February 1825, La Paz was already in their\r\npossession, and the royalist garrisons of several towns had gone over to\r\ntheir side. The Spanish general Olaneta, with a diminished army of 2000\r\nmen, was confined to the province of Potosi, where he held out till\r\nMarch 1825, when he was mortally wounded in an action with some of his\r\nown revolted troops.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bolivia a nation.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sucre was now invested with the supreme command in Upper Peru,\r\nuntil the requisite measures could be taken to establish in that country\r\na regular and constitutional government. Deputies from the various\r\nprovinces to the number of fifty-four were assembled at Chuquisaca, the\r\ncapital, to decide upon the question proposed to them on the part of the\r\ngovernment of the Argentine provinces, whether they would or would not\r\nremain separate from that country. In August 1825 they decided this\r\nquestion, declaring it to be the national will that Upper Peru should in\r\nfuture constitute a distinct and independent nation. This assembly\r\ncontinued their session, although the primary object of their meeting\r\nhad thus been accomplished, and afterwards gave the name of Bolivia to\r\nthe country,--issuing at the same time a formal declaration of\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nThe first general assembly of deputies of Bolivia dissolved itself on\r\nthe 6th of October 1825, and a new congress was summoned and formally\r\ninstalled at Chuquisaca on the 25th of May 1826, to take into\r\nconsideration the constitution prepared by Bolivar for the new republic.\r\nA favourable report was made to that body by a committee appointed to\r\nexamine it, on which it was approved by the congress, and declared to be\r\nthe constitution of the republic; and as such, it was sworn to by the\r\npeople. General Sucre was chosen president for life, according to the\r\nconstitution, but only accepted the appointment for the space of two\r\nyears, and on the express condition that 2000 Colombian troops should be\r\npermitted to remain with him.\r\n\r\nThe independence of the country, so dearly bought, did not, however,\r\nsecure for it a peaceful future. Repeated risings occurred, till in the\r\nend of 1827 General Sucre and his Colombian troops were driven from La\r\nPaz. A new congress was formed at Chuquisaca in April 1828, which\r\nmodified the constitution given by Bolivar, and chose Marshal Santa Cruz\r\nfor president; but only a year later a revolution, led by General\r\nBlanco, threw the country into disorder and for a time overturned the\r\ngovernment. Quiet being again restored in 1831, Santa Cruz promulgated\r\nthe code of laws which bore his name, and brought the financial affairs\r\nof the country into some order; he also concluded a treaty of commerce\r\nwith Peru, and for several years Bolivia remained in peace. In 1835,\r\nwhen a struggle for the chief power had made two factions in the\r\nneighbouring republic of Peru, Santa Cruz was induced to take a part in\r\nthe contest; he marched into that country, and after defeating General\r\nGamarra, the leader of one of the opposing parties, completed the\r\npacification of Peru in the spring of 1836, named himself its protector,\r\nand had in view a confederation of the two countries. At this juncture\r\nthe government of Chile interfered actively, and espousing the cause of\r\nGamarra, sent troops into Peru. Three years of fighting ensued till in a\r\nbattle at Jungay in June 1839 Santa Cruz was defeated and exiled,\r\nGamarra became president of Peru, and General Velasco provisional chief\r\nin Bolivia. The Santa Cruz party, however, remained strong in Bolivia,\r\nand soon revolted successfully against the new head of the government,\r\nultimately installing General Ballivian in the chief power. Taking\r\nadvantage of the disturbed condition of Bolivia, Gamarra made an attempt\r\nto annex the rich province of La Paz, invading it in August 1841 and\r\nbesieging the capital; but in a battle with Ballivian his army was\r\ntotally routed, and Gamarra himself was killed. The Bolivian general was\r\nnow in turn to invade Peru, when Chile again interfered to prevent him.\r\nBallivian remained in the presidency till 1848, when he retired to\r\nValparaiso, and in the end of that year General Belzu, after leading a\r\nsuccessful military revolution, took the chief power, and during his\r\npresidency endeavoured to promote agriculture, industry and trade.\r\nGeneral Jorge Cordova succeeded him, but had not been long in office\r\nwhen a new revolt in September 1857, originating with the garrison of\r\nOruro, spread over the land, and compelled him to quit the country. His\r\nplace was taken by Dr Jose Maria Linares, the originator of the\r\nrevolution, who, taking into his own hands all the powers of government,\r\nand acting with the greatest severity, caused himself to be proclaimed\r\ndictator in March 1858. Fresh disturbances led to the deposition of\r\nLinares in 1861, when Dr Maria de Acha was chosen president. In 1862 a\r\ntreaty of peace and commerce with the United States was ratified, and in\r\nthe following year a similar treaty was concluded with Belgium; but new\r\ncauses of disagreement with Chile had arisen in the discovery of rich\r\nbeds of guano on the eastern coast-land of the desert of Atacama, which\r\nthreatened warfare, and were only set at rest by the treaty of August\r\n1866, in which the 24th parallel of latitude was adopted as the boundary\r\nbetween the two republics. A new military revolution, led by Maria\r\nMelgarejo, broke out in 1865, and in February of that year the troops of\r\nPresident Acha were defeated in a battle near Potosi, when Melgarejo\r\ntook the dominion of the country. After defeating two revolutions, in\r\n1865 and 1866, the new president declared a political amnesty, and in\r\n1869, after imposing a revised constitution on the country, he became\r\nits dictator.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Recent history.\r\n\r\nIn January 1871 President Melgarejo was in his turn deposed and driven\r\nfrom the country by a revolution headed by Colonel Augustin Morales. The\r\nlatter, becoming president, was himself murdered in November 1872 and\r\nwas succeeded by Colonel Adolfo Ballivian, who died in 1874. Under this\r\npresident Bolivia entered upon a secret agreement with Peru which was\r\ndestined to have grave consequences for both countries. To understand\r\nthe reasons that urged Bolivia to take this step it is necessary to go\r\nback to the above-mentioned treaty of 1866 between Chile and Bolivia. By\r\nthis instrument Bolivia, besides conceding the 24th parallel as the\r\nboundary of Chilean territory, agreed that Chile should have a half\r\nshare of the customs and full facilities for trading on the coast that\r\nlay between the 23rd and 24th parallels, Chile at that time being\r\nlargely interested in the trade of that region. It was also agreed that\r\nChile should be allowed to mine and export the products of this district\r\nwithout tax or hindrance on the part of Bolivia. In 1870, in further\r\nconsideration of the sum of $10,000, Bolivia granted to an Anglo-Chilean\r\ncompany the right of working certain nitrate deposits north of the 24th\r\nparallel. The great wealth which was passing into Chilean hands owing to\r\nthese compacts created no little discontent in Bolivia, nor was Peru\r\nany better pleased with the hold that Chilean capital was establishing\r\nin the rich district of Tarapaca. On 6th February 1873 Bolivia entered\r\nupon a secret agreement with Peru, the ostensible object of which was\r\nthe preservation of their territorial integrity and their mutual defence\r\nagainst exterior aggression. There can be no doubt that the aggression\r\ncontemplated as possible by both countries was a further encroachment on\r\nthe part of Chile.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of Adolfo Ballivian, immediately after the conclusion of\r\nthis treaty with Peru, Dr Tomas Frias succeeded to the presidency. He\r\nsigned yet another treaty with Chile, by which the latter agreed to\r\nwithdraw her claim to half the duties levied in Bolivian ports on\r\ncondition that all Chilean industries established in Bolivian territory\r\nshould be free from duty for twenty-five years. This treaty was never\r\nratified, and four years later General Hilarion Daza, who had succeeded\r\nDr Frias as president in 1876, demanded as the price of Bolivia's\r\nconsent that a tax of 10 cents per quintal should be paid on all\r\nnitrates exported from the country, further declaring that, unless this\r\nlevy was paid, nitrates in the hands of the exporters would be seized by\r\nthe Bolivian government. As an answer to these demands, and in order to\r\nprotect the property of Chilean subjects, the Chilean fleet was sent to\r\nblockade the ports of Antofagasta, Cobija and Tocapilla. On the 14th\r\nFebruary 1879 the Chilean colonel Sotomayor occupied Antofagasta, and on\r\n1st March, a fortnight later, the Bolivian government declared war.\r\n\r\nAn offer on the part of Peru to act as mediator met with no favour from\r\nChile. The existence of the secret treaty, well known to the Chilean\r\ngovernment, rendered the intervention of Peru more than questionable,\r\nand the law passed by the latter in 1875, which practically created a\r\nmonopoly of the Tarapaca nitrate beds to the serious prejudice of\r\nChilean enterprise, offered no guarantee of her good faith. Chile\r\nreplied by curtly demanding the annulment of the secret treaty and an\r\nassurance of Peruvian neutrality. Both demands being refused, she\r\ndeclared war upon Peru.\r\n\r\nThe superiority of the Chileans at sea, though checked for some time by\r\nthe heroic gallantry of the Peruvians, soon enabled them to land a\r\nsufficient number of troops to meet the allied forces which had\r\nconcentrated at Arica and other points in the south. The Bolivian ports\r\nwere already in Chilean hands, and a sea attack upon Pisagua surprised\r\nand routed the troops under the Peruvian general Buendia and opened the\r\nway into the southern territory of Peru. General Daza, who should have\r\ncooperated with Buendia, turned back, on receiving news of the Peruvian\r\ndefeat, and led the Bolivian troops to Tacna in a hasty and somewhat\r\ndisorderly retreat. The fall of San Francisco followed, and Iquique,\r\nwhich was evacuated by the allies without a struggle, was occupied.\r\nSevere fighting took place before Tarapaca surrendered, but the end of\r\n1879 saw the Chileans in complete possession of the province.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a double revolution took place in Peru and Bolivia. In the\r\nformer country General Prado was deposed and Colonel Pierola proclaimed\r\ndictator. The Bolivians followed the example of their allies. The troops\r\nat Tacna, indignant at the inglorious part they had been condemned to\r\nplay by the incompetence or cowardice of their president, deprived him\r\nof their command and elected Colonel Camacho to lead them. At the same\r\ntime a revolution in La Paz proclaimed General Narciso Campero\r\npresident, and he was elected to that post in the following June by the\r\nordinary procedure of the constitution. During 1880 the war was chiefly\r\nmaintained at sea between Chile and Peru, Bolivia taking little or no\r\npart in the struggle. In January of 1881 were fought the battles of\r\nChorillos and Miraflores, attended by heavy slaughter and savage\r\nexcesses on the part of the Chilean troops. They were followed almost\r\nimmediately by the surrender of Lima and Callao, which left the Chileans\r\npractically masters of Peru. In the interior, however, where the\r\nPeruvian admiral Montero had formed a provisional government, the war\r\nstill lingered, and in September 1882 a conference took place between\r\nthe latter and President Campero, at which it was decided that they\r\nshould hold out for better terms. But the Peruvians wearied of the\r\nuseless struggle. On the 20th of October 1883 they concluded a treaty of\r\npeace with Chile; the troops at Arequipa, under Admiral Montero,\r\nsurrendered that town, and Montero himself, coldly received in Bolivia,\r\nwhither he had fled for refuge, withdrew from the country to Europe. On\r\nthe 9th of November the Chilean army of occupation was concentrated at\r\nArequipa, while what remained of the Bolivian army lay at Oruro.\r\nNegotiations were opened, and on 11th December a peace was signed\r\nbetween Chile and Bolivia. By this treaty Bolivia ceded to Chile the\r\nwhole of its sea-coast, including the port of Cobija.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of May 1895 a treaty was signed at Santiago between Chile\r\nand Bolivia, \"with a view to strengthening the bonds of friendship which\r\nunite the two countries,\" and, \"in accord with the higher necessity that\r\nthe future development and commercial prosperity of Bolivia require her\r\nfree access to the sea.\" By this treaty Chile declared that if, in\r\nconsequence of the plebiscite (to take place under the treaty of Ancon\r\nwith Peru), or by virtue of direct arrangement, she should \"acquire\r\ndominion and permanent sovereignty over the territories of Tacna and\r\nArica, she undertakes to transfer them to Bolivia in the same form and\r\nto the same extent as she may acquire them\"; the republic of Bolivia\r\npaying as an indemnity for that transfer $5,000,000 silver. If this\r\ncession should be effected, Chile should advance her own frontier north\r\nof Camerones to Vitor, from the sea up to the frontier which actually\r\nseparates that district from Bolivia. Chile also pledged herself to use\r\nher utmost endeavour, either separately or jointly with Bolivia, to\r\nobtain possession of Tacna and Arica. If she failed, she bound herself\r\nto cede to Bolivia the roadstead (_caleta_) of Vitor, or another\r\nanalogous one, and $5,000,000 silver. Supplementary protocols to this\r\ntreaty stipulated that the port to be ceded must \"fully satisfy the\r\npresent and future requirements\" of the commerce of Bolivia.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of May 1895 further treaties of peace and commerce were\r\nsigned with Chile, but the provisions with regard to the cession of a\r\nseaport to Bolivia still remained unfulfilled. During those ten years of\r\nrecovery on the part of Bolivia from the effects of the war, the\r\npresidency was held by Dr Pacheco, who succeeded Campero, and held\r\noffice for the full term; by Dr Aniceto Arce, who held it until 1892,\r\nand by Dr Mariano Baptista, his successor. In 1896 Dr Severe Alonso\r\nbecame president, and during his tenure of office diplomatic relations\r\nwere resumed with Great Britain, Senor Aramayo being sent to London as\r\nminister plenipotentiary in July 1897. As an outcome of his mission an\r\nextradition treaty was concluded with Great Britain in March 1898.\r\n\r\nIn December an attempt was made to pass a law creating Sucre the\r\nperpetual capital of the republic. Until this Sucre had taken its turn\r\nwith La Paz, Cochabamba and Oruro. La Paz rose in open revolt. On the\r\n17th of January of the following year a battle was fought some 40 m.\r\nfrom La Paz between the insurgents and the government forces, in which\r\nthe latter were defeated with the loss of a colonel and forty-three men.\r\nColonel Pando, the insurgent leader, having gained a strong following,\r\nmarched upon Oruro, and entered that town on 11th April 1899, after\r\ncompletely defeating the government troops. Dr Severo Alonso took refuge\r\nin Chilean territory; and Colonel Pando formed a provisional government.\r\nHe had no difficulty in obtaining his election to the presidency without\r\nopposition. He entered upon office on the 26th of October, and proved\r\nhimself to be a strong and capable chief magistrate. He had to deal with\r\ntwo difficult settlements as to boundaries with Chile and Brazil, and to\r\ntake steps for improving the means of communication in the country, by\r\nthis means reviving its mining and other industries. The dispute with\r\nBrazil over the rich Acre rubber-producing territory was accentuated by\r\nthe majority of those engaged in the rubber industry being Brazilians,\r\nwho resented the attempts of Bolivian officials to exercise authority in\r\nthe district. This led to a declaration of independence on the part of\r\nthe state of Acre, and the despatch of a body of Bolivian troops in 1900\r\nto restore order. There was no desire, however, on the part of\r\nPresident Pando to involve himself in hostilities with Brazil, and in a\r\nspirit of concession the dispute was settled amicably by diplomatic\r\nmeans, and a treaty signed in November 1903. A new boundary line was\r\ndrawn, and a portion of the Acre province ceded to Brazil in\r\nconsideration of a cash indemnity of $10,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe long-standing dispute with Chile with regard to its occupation of\r\nthe former Bolivian provinces of Tacna and Arica under the Parto de\r\nTregna of the 4th of April 1884 was more difficult to arrange\r\nsatisfactorily. In 1895 there had been some prospect of Chile conceding\r\nan outlet on the sea in exchange for a recognition of the Chilean\r\nownership of Tacna and Arica. The discovery, however, of secret\r\nnegotiations between Bolivia and Argentina caused Chile to change its\r\nconciliatory attitude. Bolivia was in no position to venture upon\r\nhostilities or to compel the Chileans to make concessions, and the final\r\nsettlement of the boundary dispute between Argentina and Chile deprived\r\nthe Bolivians of the hope of obtaining the support of the Argentines.\r\nPresident Pando and his successor, Ismail Montes, who became president\r\nin 1904, saw that it was necessary to yield, and to make the best terms\r\nthey could. A treaty was accordingly ratified in 1905, which was in many\r\nways advantageous to Bolivia, though the republic was compelled to cede\r\nto Chile the maritime provinces occupied by the latter power since the\r\nwar of 1881, and to do without a seaport. The government of Chile\r\nundertook to construct a railway at its own cost from Arica to the\r\nBolivian capital, La Paz, and to give the Bolivians free transit through\r\nChilean territory to certain towns on the coast. Chile further agreed to\r\npay Bolivia a cash indemnity and lend certain pecuniary assistance to\r\nthe construction of other railways necessary for the opening out of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n  See C.

It is prettily situated amongst\r\norchards and possesses a cathedral. There is a lively trade in hemp,\r\nhemp-seed oil, hemp goods and cattle, and there are hemp-mills,\r\nsoap-works and tanneries. The much-venerated monastery, Optina Pustyn,\r\nis close by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLL, a botanical term for a fruit-pod, particularly of the cotton\r\nplant. The word is in O. Eng. _bolla_, which is also represented in\r\n\"bowl,\" a round vessel for liquids, a variant due to \"bowl,\" ball, which\r\nis from the Fr. _boule_. \"Boll\" is also used, chiefly in Scotland and\r\nthe north of England, as a measure of weight for flour = 140 lb., and of\r\ncapacity for grain: 16 pecks = 1 boll.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLLANDISTS, the Belgian Jesuits who publish the _Acta Sanctorum_, the\r\ngreat collection of biographies and legends of the saints, arranged by\r\ndays, in the order of the calendar. The original idea was conceived by a\r\nJesuit father, Heribert Rosweyde (see HAGIOLOGY), and was explained by\r\nhim in a sort of prospectus, which he issued in 1607 under the title of\r\n_Fasti sanctorum quorum vitae in Belgicis Bibliothecis manuscriptae_.\r\nHis intention was to publish in eighteen volumes the lives of the saints\r\ncompiled from the MSS., at the same time adding sober notes. At the time\r\nof his death (1629) he had collected a large amount of material, but had\r\nnot been able actually to begin the work. A Jesuit father, John Bolland,\r\nwas appointed to carry on the project, and was sent to Antwerp. He\r\ncontinued to amass material, and extended the scope of the work. In 1643\r\nthe two volumes for January appeared. The three volumes for February\r\nappeared in 1658, the three for March in 1668, the three for April in\r\n1675, and so on. In 1635 Henschenius (Godfried Henschen) was associated\r\nwith Bolland, and collaborated in the work until 1681. From 1659 to 1714\r\nPapebroch (Daniel van Papenbroeck) collaborated. This was the most\r\nbrilliant period in the history of the _Acta Sanctorum_. The freedom of\r\nPapebroch's criticism made him many enemies, and he had often to defend\r\nhimself against their attacks. The work was continued--with some\r\ninequalities, but always in the same spirit--until the suppression of\r\nthe Society of Jesus in 1773. The last volume published was vol. iii. of\r\nOctober, which appeared in 1770.\r\n\r\nOn the dispersion of the Jesuits the Bollandists were authorized to\r\ncontinue their work, and remained at Antwerp until 1778, when they were\r\ntransferred to Brussels, to the monastery of canons regular of\r\nCoudenberg. Here they published vol. iv. of October in 1780, and vol. v.\r\nof October in 1786, when the monastery of Coudenberg was suppressed. In\r\n1788 the work of the Bollandists ceased. The remains of their library\r\nwere acquired by the Premonstratensians of Tongerloo, who endeavoured to\r\ncontinue the work, and in their abbey vol. vi. of October appeared in\r\n1794.\r\n\r\nAfter the re-establishment of the Society of Jesus in Belgium the work\r\nwas again taken up in 1837, at the suggestion of the Academie Royale of\r\nBelgium and with the support of the Belgian government, and the\r\nBollandists were installed at the college of St Michael in Brussels. In\r\n1845 appeared vol. vii. of October, the first of the new series, which\r\nreached vol. xiii. of October in 1883. In this series the Jesuit fathers\r\nJoseph van der Moere, Joseph van Hecke, Benjamin Bossue, Victor and Remi\r\nde Buck, Ant. Tinnebroeck, Edu. Carpentier and Henr. Matagne\r\ncollaborated. Father John Martinov of Theazan was entrusted with the\r\nediting of the _Annus Graeco-Slavicus_, which appeared in the beginning\r\nof vol. xi. of October in 1864.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 the activities of the Bollandists were exerted in a new\r\ndirection, with a view to bringing the work more into line with the\r\nprogress of historical methods. A quarterly review was established under\r\nthe title of _Analecta Bollandiana_ by the Jesuit fathers C. de Smedt,\r\nG. van Hooff and J. de Backer. This reached its 25th volume in 1906, and\r\nwas edited by the Bollandists de Smedt, F. van Ontroy, H. Delehaye, A.\r\nPorcelet and P. Peeters. This review contains studies in preparation for\r\nthe continuation and remoulding of the _Acta Sanctorum_, inedited texts,\r\ndissertations, and, since 1892, a _Bulletin des publications\r\nhagiographiques_, containing criticisms of recent works on hagiographic\r\nquestions. In addition to this review, the Bollandists undertook the\r\nanalysis of the hagiographic MSS. in the principal libraries. Besides\r\nnumerous library catalogues published in the _Analecta_ (e.g. those of\r\nChartres, Namur, Ghent, Messina, Venice, etc.), separate volumes were\r\ndevoted to the Latin MSS. in the Bibliotheque Royale at Brussels (2\r\nvols., 1886-1889), to the Latin and Greek MSS. in the Bibliotheque\r\nNationale at Paris (5 vols., 1889-1896), to the Greek MSS. in the\r\nVatican (1899), and to the Latin MSS. in the libraries of Rome (1905\r\nseq.). They also prepared inventories of the hagiographic texts hitherto\r\npublished, and of these there have appeared the _Bibliotheca\r\nhagiographica graeca_ (1895), the _Bibliotheca hagiographica latina_\r\n(1899) and the _Bibliotheca hagiographica Orientalis_. These\r\nindispensable works delayed the publication of the principal collection,\r\nbut tended to give it a more solid basis and a strictly scientific\r\nstamp. In 1887 appeared vol. i. for November; in 1894, vol. ii.,\r\npreceded by the _Martyrologium Hieronymianum_ by J.B. de Rossi and the\r\nabbe Louis Duchesne; in 1902, the _Propylaeum ad Acta Sanctorum\r\nNovembris_, comprising the _Synaxarium ecclesiae Constantinopolitanae_.\r\n\r\nThere are three editions of the _Acta Sanctorum_: the original edition\r\n(Antwerp, Tongerloo and Brussels, 63 vols., 1643-1902); the Venice\r\nedition, stopping at vol. v. of September (1734-1770); and the Paris\r\nedition, stopping at vol. xiii. of October (61 vols., 1863-1883). In\r\naddition to these, there is a volume of tables, edited by the abbe\r\nRigollot.\r\n\r\n  See _Acta Sanctorum apologelicis libris ... vindicata_ (Antwerp,\r\n  1755); L.P.

De.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLOGNA, GIOVANNI DA (1524-1608) [Ital. for his real name, JEAN BOLOGNE\r\nor BOULLONGNE], French sculptor, was born at Douai in 1524. His early\r\ntraining as a sculptor was conducted at Antwerp, but at the age of\r\ntwenty-five he went to Italy and he settled in 1553 in Florence, where\r\nhis best works still remain. His two most celebrated productions are the\r\nsingle bronze figure of Mercury, poised on one foot, resting on the head\r\nof a zephyr, as if in the act of springing into the air (in the Bargello\r\ngallery), and the marble group known as the Rape of the Sabines, which\r\nwas executed for Francesco de' Medici and received this name, Lanzi\r\ninforms us, after it was finished. It is now in the Loggia de Lanzi of\r\nthe ducal piazza. Giovanni was also employed at Genoa, where he executed\r\nvarious excellent works, chiefly in bronze. Most of his pieces are\r\ncharacterized by great spirit and elegance. His great fountain at\r\nBologna (1563-1567) is remarkable for beauty of proportion. Noteworthy\r\nalso are his two fountains in the Boboli gardens, one completed in 1576\r\nand the other in 1585. He also cast the fine bronze equestrian statue of\r\nCosimo de' Medici at Florence and the very richly decorated west door of\r\nPisa cathedral. One of Bologna's best works, a group of two nude figures\r\nfighting, is now lost. A fine copy in lead was at one time in the front\r\nquadrangle of Brasenose College, Oxford. In 1881 it was sold for old\r\nlead by the principal and fellows of the college, and was melted down by\r\nthe plumber who bought it.\r\n\r\n  See _La Vie et l'oeuvre de Jean Bologne, par Abel Desjardins, d'apres\r\n  les manuscrits--recueillis par Foucques de Vagnonville_ (1883,\r\n  numerous illustrations; list of works).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLOGNA, a city and archiepiscopal see of Emilia, Italy, the capital of\r\nthe province of Bologna, and headquarters of the VI. army corps. It is\r\nsituated at the edge of the plain of Emilia, 180 ft. above sea-level at\r\nthe base of the Apennines, 82 m. due N. of Florence by rail, 63 m. by\r\nroad and 50 m. direct, and 134 m. S.E. of Milan by rail. Pop. (1901)\r\ntown, 102,122; commune, 153,501. The more or less rectangular Roman\r\ncity, orientated on the points of the compass, with its streets arranged\r\nat right angles, can be easily distinguished from the outer city, which\r\nreceived its fortifications in 1206 (see G. Gozzadini, _Studi\r\narcheologico-topografici sulla citta di Bologna_, Bologna, 1868). The\r\nstreets leading to the gates of the latter radiate from the outskirts,\r\nand not from the centre, of the former. Some of the oldest churches,\r\nhowever, lie outside the limits of the Roman city (of which no buildings\r\nremain above ground) such as S. Stefano, S. Giovanni in Monte and SS.\r\nVitale ed Agricola. The first consists of a group of no less than seven\r\ndifferent buildings, of different dates; the earliest of which, the\r\nformer cathedral of SS. Pietro e Paolo, was constructed about the middle\r\nof the 4th century, in part with the debris of Roman buildings; while S.\r\nSepolcro, a circular church with ornamentation in brick and an imitation\r\nof _opus reticulatum_, should probably be attributed to the 6th or 7th\r\ncenturies. The present cathedral (S. Pietro), erected in 910, is now\r\nalmost entirely in the baroque style. The largest church in the town,\r\nhowever, is that of S. Petronio, the patron saint of Bologna, which was\r\nbegun in 1390; only the nave and aisles as far as the transepts were,\r\nhowever, completed, but even this is a fine fragment, in the Gothic\r\nstyle, measuring 384 ft. long, and 157 wide, whereas the projected\r\nlength of the whole (a cruciform basilica) was over 700 ft., with a\r\nbreadth across the transepts of 460 ft., and a dome 500 ft. high over\r\nthe crossing (see F. Cavazza in _Rassegna d' Arte_, 1905, 161). The\r\nchurch of S. Domenico, which contains the body of the saint, who died\r\nhere in 1221, is unfinished externally, while the interior was\r\nremodelled in the 18th century. There are many other churches of\r\ninterest, among them S. Francesco, perhaps the finest medieval building\r\nin Bologna, begun in 1246 and finished in 1260; it has a fine brick\r\ncampanile of the end of the 14th century. It was restored to sacred uses\r\nin 1887, and has been carefully liberated from later alterations (U.\r\nBerti in _Rassegna d' Arte_, 1901, 55). The church of Corpus Dominii has\r\nfine 15th-century terra cottas on the facade (F. Malaguzzi Valeri in\r\n_Archivio Storico dell' Arte_, ser. ii. vol. ii. (Rome, 1896), 72). The\r\ncentre of the town is formed by the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele (formerly\r\nPiazza Maggiore), and the Piazza del Nettuno, which lie at right angles\r\nto one another. Here are the church of S. Petronio, the massive Palazzo\r\nComunale, dating from 1245, the Palazzo del Podesta, completed in the\r\nsame year, and the fine bronze statue of Neptune by Giovanni da Bologna\r\n(Jean Bologne of Douai).\r\n\r\nThe famous university of Bologna was founded in the 11th century (its\r\nfoundation by Theodosius the Great in A.D. 425 is legendary), and\r\nacquired a European reputation as a school of jurisprudence under Pepo,\r\nthe first known teacher at Bologna of Roman law (about 1076), and his\r\nsuccessor Irnerius and their followers the glossators. The students\r\nnumbered between three and five thousand in the 12th to the 15th\r\ncentury, and in 1262, it is said, nearly ten thousand (among them were\r\nboth Dante and Petrarch). Anatomy was taught here in the 14th century.\r\nBut despite its fame, the university, though an autonomous corporation,\r\ndoes not seem to have had any fixed residence: the professors lectured\r\nin their own houses, or later in rooms hired or lent by the civic\r\nauthorities. It was only in 1520 that the professors of law were given\r\napartments in a building belonging to the church of S. Petronio; and in\r\n1562, by order of Pius IV., the university itself was constructed close\r\nby, by Carlo Borromeo, then cardinal legate. The reason of this measure\r\nwas no doubt partly disciplinary, Bologna itself having in 1506 passed\r\nunder the dominion of the papacy. Shortly after this, in 1564, Tasso was\r\na student there, and was tried for writing a satirical poem. One of the\r\nmost famous professors was Marcello Malpighi, a great anatomist of the\r\n17th century. The building has served as the communal library since\r\n1838. Its courtyard contains the arms of those students who were elected\r\nas representatives of their respective nations or faculties. The\r\nuniversity has since 1803 been established in the (16th century) Palazzo\r\nPoggi. Between 1815 and 1848 the number of students sank to about a\r\nhundred in some years, chiefly owing to the political persecutions of\r\nthe government: in 1859 the number had risen to 355. It now possesses\r\nfour faculties and is attended by some 1700 students. Among its\r\nprofessors women have more than once been numbered.\r\n\r\nThe Museo Civico is one of the most important museums in Italy,\r\ncontaining especially fine collections of antiquities from Bologna and\r\nits neighbourhood. The picture gallery is equally important in its way,\r\naffording a survey both of the earlier Bolognese paintings and of the\r\nworks of the Bolognese eclectics of the 16th and 17th centuries, the\r\nCaracci, Guido Reni, Domenichino, Guercino, &c. The primitive masters\r\nare not of great excellence, but the works of the masters of the 15th\r\ncentury, especially those of Francesco Francia (1450-1517) and Lorenzo\r\nCosta of Ferrara (1460-1535), are of considerable merit. The great\r\ntreasure of the collection is, however, Raphael's S. Cecilia, painted\r\nfor the church of S. Giovanni in Monte, about 1515.\r\n\r\nThe two leaning towers, the Torre Asinelli and the Torre Garisenda,\r\ndating from 1109 and 1110 respectively, are among the most remarkable\r\nstructures in Bologna: they are square brick towers, the former being\r\n320 ft. in height and 4 ft. out of the perpendicular, the latter\r\n(unfinished) 163 ft. high and 10 ft. out of the perpendicular. The town\r\ncontains many fine private palaces, dating from the 13th century\r\nonwards. The streets are as a rule arcaded, and this characteristic has\r\nbeen preserved in modern additions, which have on the whole been made\r\nwith considerable taste, as have also the numerous restorations of\r\nmedieval buildings. A fine view may be had from the Madonna di S. Luca,\r\non the south-west of the town (938 ft.).\r\n\r\nAmong the specialities of Bologna may be noted the _salami_ or\r\n_mortadella_ (Bologna sausage), _tortellini_ (a kind of macaroni) and\r\nliqueurs.\r\n\r\nBologna is an important railway centre, just as the ancient Bononia was\r\na meeting-point of important roads. Here the main line from Milan\r\ndivides, one portion going on parallel to the line of the ancient Via\r\nAemilia (which it has followed from Piacenza downwards) to Rimini,\r\nAncona and Brindisi, and the other through the Apennines to Florence and\r\nthence to Rome. Another line runs to Ferrara and Padua, another\r\n(eventually to be prolonged to Verona) to S. Felice sul Panaro, and a\r\nthird to Budrio and Portomaggiore (a station on the line from Ferrara to\r\nRavenna). Steam tramways run to Vignola, Pieve di Cento and Malalbergo.\r\n\r\nBologna was only for a short while subject to the Lombards, remaining\r\ngenerally under the rule of the exarchate of Ravenna, until this in 756\r\nwas given by Pippin to the papacy. It was sacked by the Hungarians in\r\n902, but otherwise its history is little known, and it is uncertain when\r\nit acquired its freedom and its motto _Libertas_. But the first\r\n\"constitution\" of the commune of Bologna dates from about 1123, and at\r\nthat time we find it a free and independent city. From the 12th to the\r\n14th century it was very frequently at war, and strongly supported the\r\nGuelph cause against Frederick II. and against the neighbouring cities\r\nof Romagna and Emilia; indeed, in 1249 the Bolognese took Enzio, the\r\nemperor's son, prisoner, and kept him in confinement for the rest of his\r\nlife. But the struggles between Guelphs and Ghibellines in Bologna\r\nitself soon followed, and the commune was so weakened that in 1337\r\nTaddeo de' Pepoli made himself master of the town, and in 1350 his son\r\nsold it to Giovanni Visconti of Milan. Ten years later it was given to\r\nthe papacy, but soon revolted and recovered its liberty. In 1401\r\nGiovanni Bentivoglio made himself lord of Bologna, but was killed in a\r\nrebellion of 1402. It then returned to the Visconti, and after various\r\nstruggles with the papacy was again secured in 1438 by the Bentivoglio,\r\nwho held it till 1506, when Pope Julius II. drove them out, and brought\r\nBologna once more under the papacy, under the sway of which it remained\r\n(except in the Napoleonic period between 1796 and 1815 and during the\r\nrevolutions of 1821 and 1831) until in 1860 it became part of the\r\nkingdom of Italy.\r\n\r\nAmong the most illustrious natives of Bologna may be noted Luigi Galvani\r\n(1737-1798), the discoverer of galvanism, and Prospero Lambertini (Pope\r\nBenedict XIV.).\r\n\r\n  See C. Ricci, _Guida di Bologna_ (3rd ed., Bologna, 1900).     (T. As.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLSENA (anc. _Volsinii_),[1] a town of the province of Rome, Italy, 12\r\nm. W.S.W. of Orvieto by road, situated on the north-east bank of the\r\nlake of Bolsena. Pop. (1901) 3286. The town is dominated by a\r\npicturesque medieval castle, and contains the church of S. Christina\r\n(martyred by drowning in the lake, according to the legend, in 278)\r\nwhich dates from the 11th century and contains some frescoes, perhaps of\r\nthe school of Giotto. It has a fine Renaissance facade, constructed\r\nabout 1500 by Cardinal Giovanni de' Medici (afterwards Pope Leo X.), and\r\nsome good terra cottas by the Della Robbia. Beneath the church are\r\ncatacombs, with the tomb of the saint, discovered in 1880 (E. Stevenson\r\nin _Notizie degli Scavi_, 1880, 262; G.B. de Rossi in _Bullettino\r\nd'Archeologia Cristiana_, 1880, 109). At one of the altars in this crypt\r\noccurred the miracle of Bolsena in 1263. A Bohemian priest, sceptical of\r\nthe doctrine of transubstantiation, was convinced of its truth by the\r\nappearance of drops of blood on the host he was consecrating. In\r\ncommemoration of this Pope Urban IV. instituted the festival of Corpus\r\nChristi, and ordered the erection of the cathedral of Orvieto. The\r\nmiracle forms the subject of a celebrated fresco by Raphael in the\r\nVatican.\r\n\r\nThe Lake of Bolsena (anc. _Lacus Volsiniensis_), 1000 ft. above\r\nsea-level, 71 sq. m. in area, and 480 ft. deep, is almost circular, and\r\nwas the central point of a large volcanic district, though it is\r\nprobably not itself an extinct crater. Its sides show fine basaltic\r\nformation in places. It abounds in fish, but its banks are somewhat\r\ndeserted and not free from malaria. It contains two islands, Bisentina\r\nand Martana, the former containing a church constructed by Vignola, the\r\nlatter remains of the castle where Amalasuntha, the daughter of\r\nTheodoric, was imprisoned and strangled.     (T. As.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] According to the theory now generally adopted, the Etruscan\r\n    Volsinii occupied the site of Orvieto, which was hence called _Urbs\r\n    vetus_ in late classical and medieval times, while the Roman Volsinii\r\n    was transferred to Bolaena (see VOLSINII).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLSOVER, an urban district in the north-eastern parliamentary division\r\nof Derbyshire, England, 5-1/2 m. E. of Chesterfield, on branch lines of\r\nthe Midland and the Great Central railways. Pop. (1901) 6844. It lies at\r\na considerable height on a sharp slope above a stream tributary to the\r\nriver Rother. The castle round which the town grew up was founded\r\nshortly after the Conquest by William Peveril, but the existing\r\nbuilding, a fine castellated residence, was erected on its site in 1613.\r\nThe town itself was fortified, and traces of early works remain. The\r\nchurch of St Mary is of Norman and later date; it contains some\r\ninteresting early stone-carving, and monuments to the family of\r\nCavendish, who acquired the castle in the 16th century. Coal-mining and\r\nquarrying are carried on in the neighbourhood of Bolsover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLSWARD, a town in the province of Friesland, Holland, 6-1/2 m. W.N.W.\r\nof Sneek. A steam-tramway connects it with Sneek, Makkum, Harlingen and\r\nFraneker. Pop. (1900) 6517. The Great church, or St Martin's (1446-1466)\r\nis a large building containing some good carving, a fine organ and the\r\ntombs of many Frisian nobles. The so-called Small church, dating from\r\nabout 1280, also contains fine carving and tombstones; and is the\r\nremnant of a Franciscan convent which once existed here. Bolsward also\r\npossesses a beautiful renaissance town-hall (1614-1618) and various\r\neducational and charitable institutions, including a music and a drawing\r\nschool. It has an active trade in agricultural produce, and some\r\nspinning-mills and tile and pottery works. The town is mentioned in 725,\r\nwhen it was situated on the Middle Sea. When this receded, a canal was\r\ncut to the Zuider Zee, and in 1422 it was made a Hansa town.\r\n\r\nThe medieval constitution of Bolsward, though in its government by eight\r\n_scabini_, with judicial, and four councillors with administrative\r\nfunctions, it followed the ordinary type of Dutch cities, was in some\r\nways peculiar. The family of Jongema had certain hereditary rights in\r\nthe administration, which, though not mentioned in the town charter of\r\n1455, were defined in that of 1464. According to this the head of the\r\nfamily sat for two years with the _scabini_ and the third year with the\r\ncouncillors, and had the right to administer an oath to one of each\r\nbody. More singular was the influential position assigned, in civic\r\nlegislation and administration, to the clergy, to whom in conjunction\r\nwith the councillors, there was even, in certain cases, an appeal from\r\nthe judgment of the _scabini_.\r\n\r\n  See C. Hegel, _Stadte u. Gilden der germanischen Volker im\r\n  Mittelalter_ (Leipzig, 1891).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLT, an O. Eng. word (compare Ger. _Bolz_, an arrow), for a \"quarrel\"\r\nor cross-bow shaft, or the pin which fastened a door. From the swift\r\nflight of an arrow comes the verb \"to bolt,\" as applied to a horse, &c.,\r\nand such expressions as \"bolt upright,\" meaning straight upright; also\r\nthe American use of \"bolt\" for refusing to support a candidate nominated\r\nby one's own party. In the sense of a straight pin for a fastening, the\r\nword has come to mean various sorts of appliances. From the sense of\r\n\"fastening together\" is derived the use of the word \"bolt\" as a definite\r\nlength (in a roll) of a fabric (40 ft. of canvas, &c.).\r\n\r\nFrom another \"bolt\" or \"boult,\" to sift (through O. Fr. _buleter_, from\r\nthe Med. Lat. _buretare_ or _buletare_), come such expressions as in\r\nShakespeare's _Winter's Tale_, \"The fann'd snow, That's bolted by the\r\nnorthern blasts twice o'er,\" or such a figurative use as in Burke's \"The\r\nreport of the committee was examined and sifted and bolted to the bran.\"\r\nFrom this sense comes that of to moot, or discuss, as in Milton's\r\n_Comus_, \"I hate when vice can bolt her arguments.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLTON, DUKES OF. The title of duke of Bolton was held in the family of\r\nPowlett or Paulet from 1689 to 1794. Charles Powlett, the 1st duke (c.\r\n1625-1699), who became 6th marquess of Winchester on his father's death\r\nin 1675, had been member of parliament for Winchester and then for\r\nHampshire from 1660 to 1675. Having supported the claim of William and\r\nMary to the English throne in 1688, he was restored to the privy council\r\nand to the office of lord-lieutenant of Hampshire, and was created duke\r\nof Bolton in April 1689. An eccentric man, hostile to Halifax and\r\nafterwards to Marlborough, he is said to have travelled during 1687 with\r\nfour coaches and 100 horsemen, sleeping during the day and giving\r\nentertainments at night. He died in February 1699, and was succeeded by\r\nhis elder son, Charles, 2nd duke of Bolton (1661-1722), who had also\r\nbeen a member of parliament for Hampshire and a supporter of William of\r\nOrange. He was lord-lieutenant of Hampshire and of Dorset, a\r\ncommissioner to arrange the union of England and Scotland; and was twice\r\na lord justice of the kingdom. He was also lord chamberlain of the royal\r\nhousehold; governor of the Isle of Wight; and for two short periods was\r\nlord-lieutenant of Ireland. His third wife was Henrietta (d. 1730), a\r\nnatural daughter of James, duke of Monmouth. According to Swift this\r\nduke was \"a great booby.\" His eldest son, Charles, 3rd duke of Bolton\r\n(1685-1754), was a member of parliament from 1705 to 1717, when he was\r\nmade a peer as Baron Pawlet of Basing. He filled many of the public\r\noffices which had been held by his father, and also attained high rank\r\nin the British army. Having displeased Sir Robert Walpole he was\r\ndeprived of several of his offices in 1733; but some of them were\r\nafterwards restored to him, and he raised a regiment for service against\r\nthe Jacobites in 1745. He was a famous gallant, and married for his\r\nsecond wife the singer, Lavinia Fenton (d. 1760), a lady who had\r\npreviously been his mistress. He died in August 1754, and was succeeded\r\nas 4th duke by his brother Harry (c. 1690-1759), who had been a member\r\nof parliament for forty years, and who followed the late duke as\r\nlord-lieutenant of Hampshire. The 4th duke's son, Charles (c.\r\n1718-1765), who became 5th duke in October 1759, committed suicide in\r\nLondon in July 1765, and was succeeded by his brother Harry (c.\r\n1719-1794), an admiral in the navy, on whose death without sons, in\r\nDecember 1794, the dukedom became extinct. The other family titles\r\ndescended to a kinsman, George Paulet (1722-1800), who thus became 12th\r\nmarquess of Winchester. In 1778 Thomas Orde (1746-1807) married Jean\r\nMary (d. 1814), a natural daughter of the 5th duke of Bolton, and this\r\nlady inherited Bolton Castle and other properties on the death of the\r\n6th duke. Having taken the additional name of Powlett, Orde was created\r\nBaron Bolton in 1797, and the barony has descended to his heirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLTON (or BOULTON), EDMUND (1575?-1633?), English historian and poet,\r\nwas born by his own account in 1575. He was brought up a Roman Catholic,\r\nand was educated at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, afterwards residing in\r\nLondon at the Inner Temple. In 1600 he contributed to _England's\r\nHelicon_. He was a retainer of the duke of Buckingham, and through his\r\ninfluence he secured a small place at the court of James I. Bolton\r\nformulated a scheme for the establishment of an English academy, but the\r\nproject fell through after the death of the king, who had regarded it\r\nfavourably. He wrote a _Life of King Henry II._ for Speed's _Chronicle_,\r\nbut his Catholic sympathies betrayed themselves in his treatment of\r\nThomas Becket, and a life by Dr John Barcham was substituted (Wood,\r\n_Ath. Oxon._ ed. Bliss, iii. 36). The most important of his numerous\r\nworks are _Hypercritica_ (1618?), a short critical treatise valuable for\r\nits notices of contemporary authors, reprinted in Joseph Haslewood's\r\n_Ancient Critical Essays_ (vol. ii., 1815); _Nero Caesar, or Monarchic\r\nDepraved_ (1624), with special note of British affairs. Bolton was still\r\nliving in 1633, but the date of his death is unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLTON (BOLTON-LE-MOORS), a municipal, county and parliamentary borough\r\nof Lancashire, England, 196 m. N.W. by N. from London and 11 m. N.W.\r\nfrom Manchester. Pop. (1891) 146,487; (1901) 168,215. Area, 15,279\r\nacres. It has stations on the London & North-Western and the Lancashire\r\n& Yorkshire railways, with running powers for the Midland railway. It is\r\ndivided by the Croal, a small tributary of the Irwell, into Great and\r\nLittle Bolton, and as the full name implies, is surrounded by high\r\nmoorland. Although of early origin, its appearance, like that of other\r\ngreat manufacturing towns of the vicinity, is wholly modern. It owes not\r\na little to the attractions of its site. The only remnants of antiquity\r\nare two houses of the 16th century in Little Bolton, of which one is a\r\nspecially good example of Tudor work. The site of the church of St Peter\r\nhas long been occupied by a parish church (there was one in the 12th\r\ncentury, if not earlier), but the existing building dates only from\r\n1870. There may also be mentioned a large number of other places of\r\nworship, a town hall with fine classical facade and tower, market hall,\r\nmuseums of natural history and of art and industry, an exchange,\r\nassembly rooms, and various benevolent institutions. Several free\r\nlibraries are maintained. Lever's grammar school, founded in 1641, had\r\nRobert Ainsworth, the Latin lexicographer, and John Lempriere, author of\r\nthe classical dictionary, among its masters. There are municipal\r\ntechnical schools. A large public park, opened in 1866, was laid out as\r\na relief work for unemployed operatives during the cotton famine of the\r\nearlier part of the decade. On the moors to the north-west, and\r\nincluding Rivington Pike (1192 ft.), is another public park, and there\r\nare various smaller pleasure grounds. A large number of cotton mills\r\nfurnish the chief source of industry; printing, dyeing and bleaching of\r\ncotton and calico, spinning and weaving machine making, iron and steel\r\nworks, and collieries in the neighbourhood, are also important. The\r\nspeciality, however, is fine spinning, a process assisted by the damp\r\nclimate. The parliamentary borough, created in 1832 and returning two\r\nmembers, falls within the Westhoughton division of the county. Before\r\n1838, when Bolton was incorporated, the town was governed by a\r\nborough-reeve and two constables appointed at the annual court-leet. The\r\ncounty borough was created in 1888. The corporation consists of a mayor,\r\n24 aldermen and 72 councillors.\r\n\r\nThe earliest form of the name is Bodleton or Botheltun, and the most\r\nimportant of the later forms are Bodeltown, Botheltun-le-Moors,\r\nBowelton, Boltune, Bolton-super-Moras, Bolton-in-ye-Moors,\r\nBolton-le-Moors. The manor was granted by William I. to Roger de\r\nPoictou, and passed through the families of Ferrers and Pilkington to\r\nthe Harringtons of Hornby Castle, who lost it with their other estates\r\nfor their adherence to Richard III. In 1485 Henry VII. granted it to the\r\nfirst earl of Derby. The manor is now held by different lords, but the\r\nearls of Derby still have a fourth part. The manor of Little Bolton\r\nseems to have been, at least from Henry III.'s reign, distinct from that\r\nof Great Bolton, and was held till the 17th century by the Botheltons or\r\nBoltons.\r\n\r\nFrom early days Bolton was famous for its woollen manufactures. In\r\nRichard I.'s reign an aulneger, whose duty it was to measure and stamp\r\nall bundles of woollen goods, was appointed, and it is clear, therefore,\r\nthat the place was already a centre of the woollen cloth trade. In 1337\r\nthe industry received an impulse from the settlement of a party of\r\nFlemish clothiers, and extended so greatly that when it was found\r\nnecessary in 1566 to appoint by act of parliament deputies to assist the\r\naulnegers, Bolton is named as one of the places where these deputies\r\nwere to be employed. Leland in his _Itinerary_ (1558) recorded the fact\r\nthat Bolton made cottons, which were in reality woollen goods. Real\r\ncotton goods were not made in Lancashire till 1641, when Bolton is named\r\nas the chief seat of the manufacture of fustians, vermilions and\r\ndimities. After the revocation of the edict of Nantes the settlement of\r\nsome French refugees further stimulated this industry. It was here that\r\nvelvets were first made about 1756, by Jeremiah Clarke, and muslins and\r\ncotton quiltings in 1763. The cotton trade received an astonishing\r\nimpetus from the inventions of Sir Richard Arkwright (1770), and Samuel\r\nCrompton (1780), both of whom were born in the parish. Soon after the\r\nintroduction of machinery, spinning factories were erected, and the\r\nfirst built in Bolton is said to have been set up in 1780. The number\r\nrapidly increased, and in 1851 there were 66 cotton mills with 860,000\r\nthrostle spindles at work. The cognate industry of bleaching has been\r\ncarried on since early in the 18th century, and large ironworks grew up\r\nin the latter half of the 19th century. In 1791 a canal was constructed\r\nfrom Manchester to Bolton, and by an act of parliament (1792) Bolton\r\nMoor was enclosed.\r\n\r\nDuring the Civil War Bolton sided with the parliament, and in February\r\n1643 and March 1644 the royalist forces assaulted the town, but were on\r\nboth occasions repulsed. On the 28th of May 1644, however, it was\r\nattacked by Prince Rupert and Lord Derby, and stormed with great\r\nslaughter. On the 15th of October 1651 Lord Derby, who had been taken\r\nprisoner after the battle of Worcester, was brought here and executed\r\nthe same day.\r\n\r\nUp to the beginning of the 19th century the market day was Monday, but\r\nthe customary Saturday market gradually superseded this old chartered\r\nmarket. In 1251 William de Ferrers obtained from the crown a charter\r\nfor a weekly market and a yearly fair, but gradually this annual fair\r\nwas replaced by four others chiefly for horses and cattle. The New Year\r\nand Whitsuntide Show fairs only arose during the 19th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLTON ABBEY, a village in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England, 22 m.\r\nN.W. from Leeds and 5-1/2 from Ilkley by the Midland railway. It takes\r\nits name, inaccurately, from the great foundation of Bolton Priory, the\r\nruins of which are among the most exquisitely situated in England. They\r\nstand near the right bank of the upper Wharfe, the valley of which is\r\nbeautifully wooded and closely enclosed by hills. The earliest part of\r\nthe church is of transitional Norman date; the nave, which is perfect,\r\nis Early English and Decorated. The transepts and choir are ruined, and\r\nthe remains of domestic buildings are slight. The manor of Bolton Abbey\r\nwith the rest of the district of Craven was granted by William the\r\nConqueror to Robert de Romili, who evidently held it in 1086, although\r\nthere is no mention made of it in the Domesday survey. William de\r\nMeschines and Cicely de Romili, his wife, heiress of Robert, founded and\r\nendowed a priory at Embsay or Emmesay, near Skipton, in 1120, but it was\r\nmoved here in 1151 by their daughter, Alice de Romili, wife of William\r\nFitzDuncan, who gave the manor to the monks in exchange for other lands.\r\nAfter the dissolution of the monasteries the manor was sold in 1542 to\r\nHenry Clifford, 2nd earl of Cumberland, whose descendants, the dukes of\r\nDevonshire, now hold it.\r\n\r\n  See J.D. Whitaker, LL.D., F.S.A., _History of the District of Craven_\r\n  (ed. Morant, 1878); Dugdale's _Monasticon Anglicanum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLZANO, BERNHARD (1781-1848), Austrian priest and philosopher, was born\r\nat Prague on the 5th of October 1781. He distinguished himself at an\r\nearly age, and on his ordination to the priesthood (1805) was appointed\r\nprofessor of the philosophy of religion in Prague University. His\r\nlectures, in which he endeavoured to show that Catholic theology is in\r\ncomplete harmony with reason, were received with eager interest by the\r\nyounger generation of thinkers. But his views met with much opposition;\r\nand it was only through the protection of the archbishop, Prince\r\nSalm-Salm, that he was enabled to retain his chair. In 1820 he was\r\naccused of being connected with some of the students' revolutionary\r\nsocieties, and was compelled to resign. Several doctrines extracted from\r\nhis works were condemned at Rome, and he was suspended from his priestly\r\nfunctions, spending the rest of his life in literary work. He died at\r\nPrague on the 18th of December 1848. The most important of his numerous\r\nworks are the _Wissenschaftslehre, oder Versuch einer neuen Darstellung\r\nder Logik_, advocating a scientific method in the study of logic (4\r\nvols., Sulzbach, 1837); the _Lehrbuch der Religionswissenschaft_ (4\r\nvols., Sulzbach, 1834), a philosophic representation of all the dogmas\r\nof Roman Catholic theology; and _Athanasia, oder Grunde fur die\r\nUnsterblichkeit der Seele_ (2nd ed., Mainz, 1838). In philosophy he\r\nfollowed Reinhard in ethics and the monadology of Leibnitz, though he\r\nwas also influenced by Kant.\r\n\r\n  See _Lebensbeschreibung des Dr Bolzano_ (an autobiography, 1836);\r\n  Wisshaupt, _Skizzen aus dem Leben Dr Bolzanos_ (1850); Palagy, _Kant\r\n  und Bolzano_ (Halle, 1902).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOMA (properly _Mboma_), a port on the north bank of the river Congo\r\nabout 60 m. from its mouth, the administrative capital of Belgian Congo.\r\nPop. about 5000. It was one of the places at which the European traders\r\non the west coast of Africa established stations in the 16th and 17th\r\ncenturies. It became the entrepot for the commerce of the lower Congo\r\nand a well-known mart for slaves. The trade was chiefly in the hands of\r\nDutch merchants, but British, French and Portuguese firms also had\r\nfactories there. No European power exercised sovereignty, though shadowy\r\nclaims were from time to time put forward by Portugal (see AFRICA, S 5).\r\nIn 1884 the natives of Boma granted a protectorate of their country to\r\nthe International Association of the Congo.\r\n\r\n  See H.M. Stanley, _The Congo and the Founding of its Free State_\r\n  (London, 1885).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOMB, a term formerly used for an explosive shell (see AMMUNITION) fired\r\nby artillery. The word is derived from the Gr. [Greek: bombos], a\r\nhammering, buzzing noise, cf. \"bombard\" (q.v.). At the present day it is\r\nmost frequently used of a shattering or incendiary grenade, or of an\r\nexplosive vessel actuated by clockwork or trip mechanism, employed to\r\ndestroy life or property. In naval warfare, before the introduction of\r\nthe shell gun, explosive projectiles were carried principally by special\r\nvessels known as bomb-vessels, bombards or, colloquially, bombs.\r\n\r\nIn geology, the name \"bomb\" is given to certain masses of lava which\r\nhave been hurled forth from a volcanic vent by explosive action. In\r\nshape they are spheroidal, ellipsoidal or discoidal; in structure they\r\nmay be solid, hollow or more or less cavernous; whilst in size they vary\r\nfrom that of a walnut to masses weighing several tons. It is generally\r\nheld that the form is partly due to rotation of the mass during its\r\naerial flight, and in some cases the bomb becomes twisted by a gyratory\r\nmovement. According, however, to Dr H.J. Johnston-Lavis, many of the\r\nso-called bombs of Vesuvius are not projectiles, but merely globular\r\nmasses formed in a stream of lava; and in like manner Professor J.D.\r\nDana showed that what were regarded as bombs in Hawaii are in many cases\r\nmerely lava-balls that have not been hurled through the air. Certain\r\nmasses of pumice ejected from Vulcano have been called by Johnston-Lavis\r\n\"bread-crust bombs,\" since they present a coating of obsidian which has\r\nbeen bent and cracked in a way suggestive of the crust of a roll. It is\r\nprobable that here the acid magma was expelled in a very viscous\r\ncondition, and the crust which formed on cooling was burst by the steam\r\nfrom the occluded water. Some of the bombs thrown out during recent\r\neruptions of Etna consist of white granular quartz, encased in a black\r\nscoriaceous crust, the quartz representing an altered sandstone. The\r\nbombs of granular olivine, found in some of the tuffs in the Eifel, are\r\nrepresented in most geological collections (see VOLCANO).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOMBARD (derived through Med. Lat. and Fr. forms from Gr. [Greek:\r\nbombein], to make a humming noise), a term applied in the middle ages to\r\na sort of cannon, used chiefly in sieges, and throwing heavy stone\r\nballs; hence the later use as a verb (see BOMBARDMENT). The name, in\r\nvarious forms, was also given to a medieval musical instrument\r\n(\"bombard,\" \"bumhart,\" \"pumhart,\" \"pommer\"), the forerunner of the bass\r\noboe or schalmey. At the present day a small primitive oboe called\r\n_bombarde_, with eight holes but no keys, is used among the Breton\r\npeasants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOMBARDIER, originally an artilleryman in charge of a bombard; now a\r\nnon-commissioned officer in the artillery of the British army, ranking\r\nbelow a corporal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOMBARDMENT, an attack by artillery fire directed against\r\nfortifications, troops in position or towns and buildings. In its strict\r\nsense the term is only applied to the bombardment of defenceless or\r\nundefended objects, houses, public buildings, &c., the object of the\r\nassailant being to dishearten his opponent, and specially to force the\r\ncivil population and authorities of a besieged place to persuade the\r\nmilitary commandant to capitulate before the actual defences of the\r\nplace have been reduced to impotence. It is, therefore, obvious that\r\nmere bombardment can only achieve its object when the amount of\r\nsuffering inflicted upon non-combatants is sufficient to break down\r\ntheir resolution, and when the commandant permits himself to be\r\ninfluenced or coerced by the sufferers. A threat of bombardment will\r\nsometimes induce a place to surrender, but instances of its fulfilment\r\nbeing followed by success are rare; and, in general, with a determined\r\ncommandant, bombardments fail of their object. Further, an intentionally\r\nterrific fire at a large target, unlike the slow, steady and minutely\r\naccurate \"artillery attacks \"directed upon the fortifications, requires\r\nthe expenditure of large quantities of ammunition, and wears out the\r\nguns of the attack. Bombardments are, however, frequently resorted to in\r\norder to test the temper of the garrison and the civil population, a\r\nnotable instance being that of Strassburg in 1870. The term is often\r\nloosely employed to describe artillery attacks upon forts or fortified\r\npositions in preparation for assaults by infantry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOMBARDON, or BASS TUBA, the name given to the bass and contrabass of\r\nthe brass wind in military bands, called in the orchestra bass tuba.\r\n\r\nThe name of bombardon is unquestionably derived from _bombardone_, the\r\nItalian for contrabass pommer (bombard), which, before the invention of\r\nthe fagotto, formed the bass of medieval orchestras; it is also used for\r\na bass reed stop of 16 ft. tone on the organ. The bombardon was the very\r\nfirst bass wind instrument fitted with valves, and it was at first known\r\nas the _corno basso_, _clavicor_ or _bass horn_ (not to be confounded\r\nwith the bass horn with keys, which on being perfected became the\r\nophicleide). The name was attached more to the position of the wind\r\ninstruments as bass than to the individual instrument. The original\r\ncorno basso was a brass instrument of narrow bore with the pistons set\r\nhorizontally. The valve-ophicleide in F of German make had a wider bore\r\nand three vertical pistons, but it was only a \"half instrument,\"\r\nmeasuring about 12 ft. A. Kalkbrenner, in his life of W. Wieprecht\r\n(1882), states that in the Jager military bands of Prussia the corno\r\nbasso (keyed bass horn) was introduced as bass in 1829, and the\r\nbombardon (or valve-ophicleide) in 1831; in the Guards these instruments\r\nwere superseded in 1835 by the bass tuba invented by Wieprecht and J.G.\r\nMoritz.\r\n\r\nThe modern bombardon is made in two forms: the upright model, used in\r\nstationary band music; and the circular model, known as the helicon,\r\nworn round the body with the large bell resting on the left shoulder,\r\nafter the style of the Roman _cornu_ (see HORN), which is a more\r\nconvenient way of carrying this heavy instrument when marching. The\r\nbombardon, and the euphonium, of which it is the bass, are the outcome\r\nof the application of valves to the bugle family whereby the saxhorns\r\nwere also produced. The radical difference between the saxhorns and the\r\ntubas (including the bombardon) is that the latter have a sufficiently\r\nwide conical bore to allow of the production of fundamental sounds in a\r\nrich, full quality of immense power. This difference, first recognized\r\nin Germany and Austria, has given rise in those countries to the\r\nclassification of the brass wind as \"half\" and \"whole\" instruments\r\n(_Halbe_ and _Ganze Instrumente_). When the brass wind instruments with\r\nconical bore and cup-shaped mouthpiece first came into use, it was a\r\nwell-understood principle that the tube of each instrument must\r\ntheoretically be made twice as long as an organ pipe giving the same\r\nnote; for example, the French horn sounding the 8 ft. C of an 8 ft.\r\norgan pipe, must have a tube 16 ft. long; C then becomes the second\r\nharmonic of the series for the 16 ft. tube, the first or fundamental\r\nbeing unobtainable. After the introduction of pistons, instrument-makers\r\nexperimenting with the bugle, which has a conical bore of very wide\r\ndiameter in proportion to the length, found that baritone and bass\r\ninstruments constructed on the same principle gave out the fundamental\r\nfull and clear. A new era in the construction of brass wind instruments\r\nwas thus inaugurated, and now that the proportions of the bugle have\r\nbeen adopted, the tubes of the tubas are made just half the length of\r\nthose of the older instruments, corresponding to the length of the organ\r\npipe of the same pitch, so that a euphonium sounding 8 ft. C no longer\r\nneeds to be 16 ft. long but only 8 ft. The older instruments, such as\r\nthe saxhorns, with narrow bore, have therefore been denominated \"half\r\ninstruments,\" because only half the length of the instrument is of\r\npractical utility, while the tubas with wide bore are styled \"whole\r\ninstruments.\" [1] Bombardons are made in E flat and F of the 16 ft.\r\noctave, corresponding to the orchestral bass tuba, double bass in\r\nstrings, and pedal clarinet and contrafagotto in the wood wind. The\r\nbombardon in B flat or C, an octave lower than the euphonium,\r\ncorresponds to the contrabass tuba in the orchestra.\r\n\r\n  The bombardons possess a chromatic compass of 3-1/2 to 4 octaves. The\r\n  harmonic series consists of the harmonics from the 1st to the 8th.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: BOMBARDON IN E FLAT.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HARMONIC SERIES OF THE CONTRABASS BOMBARDON IN C.]\r\n\r\n  The lowest notes produced by the valves are very difficult to obtain,\r\n  for the lips seldom have sufficient power to set in vibration a column\r\n  of air of such immense length, at a rate of vibration slow enough to\r\n  synchronize with that of notes of such deep pitch.[2] Even when they\r\n  are played, the lowest valve notes can hardly be heard unless doubled\r\n  an octave higher by another bombardon.\r\n\r\n  Bombardons are generally treated as non-transposing instruments, the\r\n  music being written as sounded, except in France and Belgium, where\r\n  transposition is usual. The intervening notes are obtained by means of\r\n  pistons or valves, which, on being depressed, either admit the wind\r\n  into additional lengths of tubing to lower the pitch, or cut off a\r\n  length in order to raise it. Bombardons usually have three or four\r\n  pistons lowering the pitch of the instrument respectively 1, 1/2,\r\n  1-1/2 and 2-1/2 tones (in Belgium, 1, 1/2, 2 and 3 tones). The valve\r\n  system, disposal of the tubing and shape and position of the bell\r\n  differ considerably in the various models of well-known makers. In\r\n  Germany and Austria[3] what is known as the cylinder action is largely\r\n  used; for the piston or pump is substituted a four-way brass cock\r\n  operated by means of a key and a series of cranks.\r\n\r\n  In order to obtain a complete chromatic scale throughout the compass,\r\n  there must be, as on the slide-trombone, seven different positions or\r\n  lengths of tubing available, each having its harmonic series. These\r\n  different lengths are obtained on the bombardon by means of a\r\n  combination of pistons: the simultaneous use of Nos. 2 and 3 lowers\r\n  the pitch two tones; of Nos. 1, 2 and 3, three tones; of Nos. 1, 2, 3,\r\n  4, five and a half tones, &c. A combination of pistons, however, fails\r\n  to give the interval with an absolutely correct intonation, since the\r\n  length of tubing thrown open is not of the theoretical length required\r\n  to produce it. Many ingenious contrivances have been invented from\r\n  time to time to remedy this inherent defect of the valve system, such\r\n  as the six-valve independent system of Adolphe Sax; the Besson\r\n  _Registre_, giving eight independent positions; the Besson\r\n  compensating system _Transpositeur_; the Boosey automatic compensating\r\n  piston invented by D.J. Blaikley, and V. Mahillon's automatic\r\n  regulating pistons. More recently the Besson enharmonic valve system,\r\n  with six independent tuning slides and three pistons, and Rudall,\r\n  Carte & Company's new (Klussmann's patent) bore, conical throughout\r\n  the open tube and additional lengths, have produced instruments which\r\n  leave nothing to be desired as to intonation.

The city\r\nstands on an island of the same name, which forms one of a group now\r\nconnected by causeways with the mainland. The area is 22 sq. m.; and the\r\npopulation of the town and island (1901) 776,006 (estimate in 1906,\r\n977,822). Bombay is the second most populous city in the Indian empire,\r\nhaving fallen behind Calcutta at the census of 1901. Its position on the\r\nside of India nearest to Europe, its advantages as a port and a railway\r\ncentre, and its monopoly of the cotton industry, are counteracted by the\r\nfact that the region which it serves cannot vie with the valley of the\r\nGanges in point of fertility and has no great waterway like the Ganges\r\nor Brahmaputra. Nevertheless Bombay pushes Calcutta hard for supremacy\r\nin point of population and commercial prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe Bombay Island, or, as it ought to be more correctly called, the\r\nBombay Peninsula, stands out from a coast ennobled by lofty hills, and\r\nits harbour is studded by rocky islands and precipices, whose peaks rise\r\nto a great height. The approach from the sea discloses one of the\r\nfinest panoramas in the world,--the only European analogy being the Bay\r\nof Naples. The island consists of a plain about 11 m. long by 3 broad,\r\nflanked by two parallel lines of low hills. A neck of land stretching\r\ntowards the south-west forms the harbour on its eastern side, sheltering\r\nit from the force of the open sea, and enclosing an expanse of water\r\nfrom 5 to 7 m. wide. At the south-west of the island, Back Bay, a\r\nshallow basin rather more than 2 m. in breadth, runs inland for about 3\r\nm. between the extreme points of the two ranges of hills. On a slightly\r\nraised strip of land between the head of Back Bay and the harbour is\r\nsituated the fort, the nucleus of the city of Bombay. From this point\r\nthe land slopes westward towards the central plain, a low-lying tract,\r\nwhich before the construction of the embankment known as the Hornby\r\nVellard, used at high tide to be submerged by the sea. The town itself\r\nconsists of well-built and unusually handsome native bazaars, and of\r\nspacious streets devoted to European commerce. In the native bazaar the\r\nhouses rise three or four storeys in height, with elaborately carved\r\npillars and front work. Some of the European hotels and commercial\r\nbuildings are on the American scale, and have no rival in any other city\r\nof India. The Taj Mahal hotel, which was built by the Tata family in\r\n1904, is the most palatial and modern hotel in India. The private houses\r\nof the European residents lie apart alike from the native and from the\r\nmercantile quarters of the town. As a rule, each is built in a large\r\ngarden or compound; and although the style of architecture is less\r\nimposing than that of the stately residences in Calcutta, it is well\r\nsuited to the climate, and has a beauty and comfort of its own. The\r\nfavourite suburb is Malabar hill, a high ridge running out into the sea,\r\nand terraced to the top by handsome houses, which command one of the\r\nfinest views, of its kind, in the world. Of recent years wealthy natives\r\nhave been competing with Europeans for the possession of this desirable\r\nquarter. To the right of this ridge, looking towards the sea, runs\r\nanother suburb known as Breach Candy, built close upon the beach and\r\nwithin the refreshing sound of the waves. To the left of Malabar hill\r\nlies Back Bay, with a promontory on its farther shore, which marks the\r\nsite of the old Bombay Fort; its walls are demolished, and the area is\r\nchiefly devoted to mercantile buildings. Farther round the island,\r\nbeyond the fort, is Mazagon Bay, commanding the harbour, and the centre\r\nof maritime activity. The defences of the port, remodelled and armed\r\nwith the latest guns, consist of batteries on the islands in the\r\nharbour, in addition to which there are three large batteries on the\r\nmainland. There is also a torpedo-boat detachment stationed in the\r\nharbour.\r\n\r\nNo city in the world has a finer water-front than Bombay. The great line\r\nof public offices along the esplanade and facing Back Bay, which are in\r\nthe Gothic style mixed with Saracenic, are not individually\r\ndistinguished for architectural merit, but they have a cumulative effect\r\nof great dignity. The other most notable buildings in the city are the\r\nVictoria terminus of the Great Indian Peninsula railway and the Taj\r\nMahal hotel. Towards the northern end of Malabar hill lie the Parsee\r\nTowers of Silence, where the Parsees expose their dead till the flesh is\r\ndevoured by vultures, and then cast the bones into a well where they\r\ncrumble into dust. The foundation-stone of a museum was laid by the\r\nprince of Wales in 1905.\r\n\r\n_Local Government._--The port of Bombay (including docks and warehouses)\r\nis managed by a port trust, the members of which are nominated by the\r\ngovernment from among the commercial community. The municipal government\r\nof the city was framed by an act of the Bombay legislative council\r\npassed in 1888. The governing body consists of a municipal corporation\r\nand a town council. The corporation is composed of 72 members, of whom\r\n16 are nominated by the government. Of the remainder, 36 are elected by\r\nthe ratepayers, 16 by the justices of the peace, 2 by the senate of the\r\nuniversity, and 2 by the chamber of commerce. The council, which forms\r\nthe standing committee of the corporation, consists of 12 members, of\r\nwhom 4 are nominated by the government and the rest elected by the\r\ncorporation. The members of the corporation include Europeans, Hindus,\r\nMahommedans and Parsees. The Bombay University was constituted in 1857\r\nas an examining body, on the model of the university of London. The\r\nchief educational institutions in Bombay City are the government\r\nElphinstone College, two missionary colleges (Wilson and St Xavier), the\r\nGrant medical college, the government law school, the Sir Jamsetjee\r\nJeejeebhoy school of art, and the Victoria Jubilee technical institute.\r\n\r\n_Docks._--The dockyard, originally built in 1736, has a sea-face of\r\nnearly 700 yds. and an area of about 200 acres. There are five graving\r\ndocks, three of which together make one large dock 648 ft. long, while\r\nthe other two make a single dock 582 ft. long. There are also four\r\nbuilding slips opposite the Apollo Bandar (landing-place) on the\r\nsouth-east side of the enclosure. The dockyard is lighted by\r\nelectricity, so that work can be carried on by night as well as day.\r\nBombay is the only important place near the sea in India where the rise\r\nof the tide is sufficient to permit docks on the largest scale. The\r\nhighest spring tides here reach 17 ft., but the average is 14 ft.\r\nPrince's dock, of which the foundation-stone was laid by the prince of\r\nWales in 1875, was opened in 1879, and is 1460 ft. long by 1000 ft.\r\nbroad, with a water area of 30 acres; while the Victoria dock, which was\r\ncompleted and opened in 1887-1888, has a water area of 25 acres. South\r\nof the Victoria dock, the foundation-stone of the Alexandra dock, the\r\nlargest in India, was laid by the prince of Wales in 1905.\r\n\r\n_Cotton Mills._--The milling industry is, next to the docks, the chief\r\nfeature of Bombay's commercial success. The staple manufacture is\r\ncotton-spinning, but in addition to this there are flour mills and\r\nworkshops to supply local needs. The number of factories increased from\r\nfifty-three in 1881 to eighty-three in 1890, and that decade saw the\r\ninflux of a great industrial population from the surrounding districts;\r\nbut the decade 1891-1901 witnessed at least a temporary set-back owing\r\nto the ravages caused by plague and the effects of over-production. In\r\naddition to the actual mortality it inflicted, the plague caused an\r\nexodus of the population from the island, disorganized the labour at the\r\ndocks and in the mills, and swallowed up large sums which were spent by\r\nthe municipality on plague operations and sanitary improvements. After\r\n1901, however, both population and trade began to revive again. In 1901\r\nthere were 131,796 persons employed in the cotton industry.\r\n\r\n_Population._--Owing to its central position between East and West and\r\nto the diversity of races in India, no city in the world can show a\r\ngreater variety of type than Bombay. The Mahratta race is the dominant\r\nelement next to the European rulers, but in addition to them are a great\r\nand influential section of Parsee merchants, Arab traders from the Gulf,\r\nAfghans and Sikhs from northern India, Bengalis, Rajputs, Chinese,\r\nJapanese, Malays, negroes, Tibetans, Sinhalese and Siamese. Bombay is\r\nthe great port and meeting-place of the Eastern world. Out of the large\r\nsections of its population, Hindu, Mahommedan, Parsee, Jain and\r\nChristian, the Parsees are one of the smallest and yet the most\r\ninfluential. They number only some 46,000 all told, but most of the\r\ngreat business houses are owned by Parsee millionaires and most of the\r\nlarge charities are founded by them.\r\n\r\n_History._--The name of the island and city of Bombay is derived from\r\nMumba (a form of Parvati), the goddess of the Kolis, a race of\r\nhusbandmen and fishermen who were the earliest known inhabitants, having\r\noccupied the island probably about the beginning of the Christian era.\r\nBombay originally consisted of seven islands (the _Heptanesia_ of\r\nPtolemy) and formed an outlying portion of the dominions of successive\r\ndynasties dominant in western India: Satavahanas, Mauryas, Chalukyas and\r\nRashtrakutas. In the Maurya and Chalukya period (450-750) the city of\r\nPuri on Elephanta Island was the principal place in Bombay harbour. The\r\nfirst town built on Bombay Island was Mahikavati (Mahim), founded by\r\nKing Bhima, probably a member of the house of the Yadavas of Deogiri, as\r\na result of Ala-ud-din Khilji's raid into the Deccan in 1294. It\r\nremained under Hindu rule until 1348, when it was captured by a\r\nMahommedan force from Gujarat; and the islands remained part of the\r\nprovince (later kingdom) of Gujarat till 1534, when they were ceded by\r\nSultan Bahadur to the Portuguese.\r\n\r\nThe island did not prosper under Portuguese rule. By the system known as\r\n_aforamento_ the lands were gradually parcelled out into a number of\r\nfiefs granted, under the crown of Portugal, to individuals or to\r\nreligious corporations in return for military service or equivalent\r\nquit-rents. The northern districts were divided among the Franciscans\r\nand Jesuits, who built a number of churches, some of which still\r\nsurvive. The intolerance of their rule did not favour the growth of the\r\nsettlement, which in 1661, when it was transferred to the British, had a\r\npopulation of only 10,000. The English had, however, long recognized its\r\nvalue as a naval base, and it was for this reason that they fought the\r\nbattle of Swally (1614-1615), attempted to capture the place in 1626,\r\nand that the Surat Council urged the purchase of Bombay from the\r\nPortuguese. In 1654 the directors of the Company drew Cromwell's\r\nattention to this suggestion, laying stress on the excellence of its\r\nharbour and its safety from attack by land. It finally became the\r\nproperty of the British in 1661 as part of the dowry of the infanta\r\nCatherine of Portugal on her marriage to Charles II., but was not\r\nactually occupied by the British until 1665, when they experienced much\r\ndifficulty in overcoming the opposition of the Portuguese, and\r\nespecially of the religious orders, to the cession. In 1668 it was\r\ntransferred by the crown to the East India Company, who placed it under\r\nthe factory of Surat.\r\n\r\nThe real foundation of the modern city dates from this time, and was the\r\nwork of Gerald Aungier (or Angier), brother of Francis Aungier, 3rd Lord\r\nAungier of Longford and 1st earl of Longford in Ireland (d. 1700), who\r\nsucceeded Sir George Oxenden as president of Surat in 1669 and died in\r\n1677. At this time Bombay was threatened by the Mahrattas from inland,\r\nby the Malabar pirates and the Dutch from the sea, and was cut off from\r\nthe mainland by the Portuguese, who still occupied the island of\r\nSalsette and had established a customs-barrier in the channel between\r\nBombay and the shore. In spite of the niggardly policy of the court of\r\ndirectors, who refused to incur the expense of employing skilled\r\nengineers, Aungier succeeded in fortifying the town and shore; he also\r\nraised a force of militia and regulars, the latter mainly Germans (as\r\nmore trustworthy than the riffraff collected in London by the Company's\r\ncrimps). In 1672 Aungier transferred his headquarters to Bombay, and\r\nafter frightening off an imposing Dutch fleet, which in 1670 attempted\r\nto surprise the island, set to work to organize the settlement anew. To\r\nthis task he brought a mind singularly enlightened and a sincere belief\r\nin the best traditions of English liberty. In its fiscal policy, in its\r\nreligious intolerance, and in its cruel and contemptuous treatment of\r\nthe natives, Portuguese rule had been alike oppressive. Aungier altered\r\nall this. With the consent of \"a general assembly of the chief\r\nrepresentatives of the people\" he commuted the burdensome land tax for a\r\nfixed money payment; he protected all castes in the celebration of their\r\nreligious ceremonies; and he forbade any compulsion of natives to carry\r\nburdens against their will. The result was that the population of Bombay\r\nincreased rapidly; a special quarter was set apart for the banya, or\r\ncapitalist, class of Hindus; while Parsees and Armenians flocked to a\r\ncity where they were secure of freedom alike for their trade and their\r\nreligion. Within eight years the population had grown from 10,000 to\r\n60,000. The immediate result of this concentration of people in a spot\r\nso unwholesome was the prevalence of disease, produced by the appalling\r\nsanitary conditions. This, too, Aungier set himself to remedy. In 1675\r\nhe initiated the works for draining the foul tidal swamps; and, failing\r\nthe consent of the Company to the erection of a regular hospital, he\r\nturned the law court into an infirmary. He also set up three courts of\r\njustice: a tribunal for petty causes under a factor with native\r\nassessors, a court of appeal under the deputy governor and members of\r\ncouncil, and a court-martial. A regular police force was also\r\nestablished and a gaol built in the Bazaar.[1]\r\n\r\nDuring this period, however, the position of Bombay was sufficiently\r\nprecarious. The Malabar pirates, though the city itself was too strong\r\nfor them, were a constant menace to its trade; and it required all the\r\ngenius of Aungier to maintain the settlement, isolated as it was between\r\nthe rival powers of the Mahrattas and the Mogul empire. After his death,\r\non the 30th of June 1677, its situation became even more precarious.\r\nEven under Aungier the Siddi admirals of the Moguls had asserted their\r\nright to use Bombay harbour as winter quarters for their fleet, though\r\nthey had failed to secure it as a base against the Mahrattas. Under his\r\nweak successor (Rolt, 1677-1682), the English waters, the value of which\r\nhad now been proved, became the battle-ground between the rival navies,\r\nand for some years Bombay lay at the mercy of both. The Company's rule,\r\nmoreover, was exposed to another danger. The niggardly policy of the\r\nboard of directors, more intent on peaceful dividends than on warlike\r\nrule, could not but be galling to soldiers of fortune. A mutiny at\r\nBombay in 1674 had only been suppressed by the execution of the\r\nringleader; and in 1683 a more formidable movement took place under\r\nRichard Keigwin, a naval officer who had been appointed governor of St\r\nHelena in reward for the part played by him in the capture of the island\r\nfrom the Dutch in 1673. Keigwin, elected governor of Bombay by popular\r\nvote, issued a proclamation in the king's name, citing the \"intolerable\r\nextortions, oppressions and exactions\" of the Company, and declaring his\r\ngovernment under the immediate authority of the crown. He ruled with\r\nmoderation, reformed the system of taxation, obtained notable\r\nconcessions from the Mahrattas, and increased the trade of the port by\r\nthe admission of \"interlopers.\" But he failed to extend the rebellion\r\nbeyond Bombay; and when a letter arrived, under the royal sign manual,\r\nordering him to surrender the fort to Sir John Child, appointed admiral\r\nand captain-general of the Company's forces, he obeyed.[2]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Company had decided to consider Bombay as \"an independent\r\nsettlement, and the seat of the power and trade of the English in the\r\nEast Indies.\" But a variety of causes set back the development of the\r\ncity, notably the prevalence of plague and cholera due to the silting up\r\nof the creeks that divided its component islands; and it was not till\r\nafter the amalgamation of the old and new companies in 1708 that the\r\ngovernor's seat was transferred from Surat to Bombay. In 1718 the city\r\nwall was completed; settlers began to stream in, especially from\r\ndistracted Gujarat; and a series of wise administrative reforms\r\nincreased this tendency until in 1744 the population, which in 1718 had\r\nsunk to 16,000, had risen to 70,000. Meanwhile the Mahratta conquest of\r\nBassein and Salsette (1737-1739) had put a stop to the hostility of the\r\nPortuguese, and a treaty of alliance with the Siddis (1733) had secured\r\na base of supplies on the mainland. The French wars of 1744-1748 and\r\n1756-1763 led to a further strengthening of the fortifications; and the\r\ninflux of settlers from the mainland made the questions of supplies and\r\nof the protection of trade from piracy more pressing. The former was in\r\npart settled by the acquisition of Bankot (1755) as a result of an\r\nalliance with the peshwa, the latter by the successful expedition under\r\nWatson and Clive against Vijayadrug (1756). During this period, too, the\r\nimportance of Bombay as a naval base, long since recognized, was\r\nincreased by the building of a dock (1750), a second being added in\r\n1762. The year 1770 saw the beginning of the cotton trade with China,\r\nthe result of a famine in that country, the Chinese government having\r\nissued an edict commanding more land to be used for growing grain. This,\r\ntoo, was a period of searching reforms in the administration and the\r\nplanning and building of the city; the result being a further immense\r\ngrowth of its population, which in 1780 was 113,000. This was still\r\nfurther increased by the famine of 1803, which drove large numbers of\r\npeople from Konkan and the Deccan to seek employment in Bombay. A great\r\nfire broke out in the fort in the same year and caused enormous loss;\r\nbut it enabled the government to open wider thoroughfares in the more\r\ncongested parts, and greatly stimulated the tendency of the natives to\r\nbuild their houses and shops outside the walls of the fort in what are\r\nnow some of the busiest parts of the city.\r\n\r\nThe British victory over the Mahrattas and the annexation of the Deccan\r\nopened a new period of unrestricted development for Bombay. At this\r\ntime, too (1819), its fortunes were vigorously fostered by Mountstuart\r\nElphinstone, and in 1838 the population had risen to 236,000. But in the\r\nnext fifty years it more than doubled itself, the figures for 1891 being\r\n821,000. This great leap was due to the influence of railways, of which\r\nthe first line was completed in 1853, the opening of the Suez Canal, and\r\nthe foundation of cotton factories. In 1866-1867 the tide of prosperity\r\nwas interrupted by a financial crisis, due to the fall in the price of\r\ncotton on the termination of the American war. Bombay, however, soon\r\nrecovered herself, and in 1891 was more prosperous than ever before; but\r\nduring the ensuing decade great havoc was played by plague (q.v.) with\r\nboth her population and her trade. In addition to a decline of 6% in the\r\npopulation, the exports also declined by 7%, whereas Calcutta's exports\r\nrose during the same period by 38%.\r\n\r\n  See S.M.

The wood used is\r\nShisham or blackwood (_Dalbergia_), a hard-grained dark-coloured timber\r\nwhich with proper treatment assumes a beautiful natural polish. Much of\r\nthe so-called Bombay furniture is clumsy and inelegant in form, defects\r\nwhich it is suggested by experts, like Sir George Birdwood, it owes to\r\nthe circumstance that the original models were Dutch. Some of the\r\nsmaller articles, such as flower stands, small tables, and ornamental\r\nstands, are, however, of exceedingly graceful contour, and good examples\r\nare highly prized by collectors. The carving at its best is lace-like in\r\ncharacter, and apart from its inherent beauty is attractive on account\r\nof the ingenuity shown by the worker in adapting his design in detail to\r\nthe purpose of the article he is fashioning. The workmen who manufacture\r\nthe most artistic Bombay furniture are a special class with inherited\r\ntraditions. Often a man knows only one design, which has been\r\ntransmitted to him by his father, who in his turn had had it from his\r\nfather before him. In recent years under European auspices efforts have\r\nbeen made with a certain measure of success to modernize the industry by\r\nintroducing portions of the native work into furniture of Western\r\ndesign. In the main, however, the conventional patterns are still\r\nadhered to. \"Bombay boxes\" are inlaid in geometrical patterns on wood.\r\nThe inlaying materials consist of the wire, sandal wood, sapan wood,\r\nebony, ivory and stags' horns, and the effect produced by the\r\ncombination of minute pieces of these various substances is altogether\r\npeculiar and distinctive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOMBAY PRESIDENCY, a province or presidency of British India, consisting\r\npartly of British districts, and partly of native states under the\r\nadministration of a governor. This territory extends from 13 deg. 53' to\r\n28 deg. 45' N., and from 66 deg. 40' to 76 deg. 30' E., and is bounded\r\non the N. by Baluchistan, the Punjab and Rajputana; on the E. by Indore,\r\nthe Central Provinces and Hyderabad; on the S. by Madras and Mysore; and\r\non the W. by the Arabian Sea. Within these limits lie the Portuguese\r\nsettlements of Diu, Damaun and Goa, and the native state of Baroda which\r\nhas direct relations with the government of India; while politically\r\nBombay includes the settlement of Aden. The total area, including Sind\r\nbut excluding Aden, is 188,745 sq. m., of which 122,984 sq. m. are under\r\nBritish and 65,761 under native rule. The total population (1901) is\r\n25,468,209, of which 18,515,587 are resident in British territory and\r\n6,908,648 in native states. The province is divided into four\r\ncommissionerships and twenty-six districts. The four divisions are the\r\nnorthern or Gujarat, the central or Deccan, the southern or Carnatic,\r\nand Sind. The twenty-six districts are: Bombay City, Ahmedabad, Broach,\r\nKaira, Panch Mahals, Surat, Thana, Ahmednagar, Khandesh (partitioned\r\ninto two districts in 1906), Nasik, Poona, Satara, Sholapur, Belgaum,\r\nBijapur, Dharwar, Kanara, Kolaba, Ratnagiri, Karachi, Hyderabad,\r\nShikarpur, Thar and Parkar, and Upper Sind Frontier. The native states\r\ncomprise in all 353 separate units, which are administered either by\r\npolitical agents or by the collectors of the districts in which the\r\nsmaller states are situated. The chief groups of states are North\r\nGujarat, comprising Cutch, Kathiawar agency, Palanpur agency, Mahi\r\nKantha agency, Rewa Kantha agency and Cambay; South Gujarat, comprising\r\nDharampur, Bansda and Sachin; North Konkan, Nasik and Khandesh,\r\ncomprising Khandesh political agency, Surgana and Jawhar; South Konkan\r\nand Dharwar, comprising Janjira, Sawantwari and Savanur; the Deccan\r\nSatara Jagirs, comprising Akalkot, Bhor, Aundh, Phaltan, Jath and\r\nDaphlapur; the southern Mahratta states, comprising Kolhapur and other\r\nstates, and Khairpur in Sind. The native states under the supervision of\r\nthe government of Bombay are divided, historically and geographically,\r\ninto two main groups. The northern or Gujarat group includes the\r\nterritories of the gaekwar of Baroda, with the smaller states which form\r\nthe administrative divisions of Cutch, Palanpur, Rewa Kantha, and Mahi\r\nKantha. These territories, with the exception of Cutch, have an\r\nhistorical connexion, as being the allies or tributaries of the gaekwar\r\nin 1805, when final engagements were included between that prince and\r\nthe British government. The southern or Mahratta group includes\r\nKolhapur, Akalkot, Sawantwari, and the Satara and southern Mahratta\r\nJagirs, and has an historical bond of union in the friendship they\r\nshowed to the British in their final struggle with the power of the\r\npeshwa in 1818. The remaining territories may conveniently be divided\r\ninto a small cluster of independent zamin-daris, situated in the wild\r\nand hilly tracts at the northern extremity of the Sahyadri range, and\r\ncertain principalities which, from their history or geographical\r\nposition, are to some extent isolated from the rest of the presidency.\r\n\r\n_Physical Aspects._--The Bombay Presidency consists of a long strip of\r\nland along the Indian Ocean from the south of the Punjab to the north of\r\nMysore. The coast is rock-bound and difficult of access; and though it\r\ncontains several bays forming fairweather ports for vessels engaged in\r\nthe coasting trade, Bombay, Karachi-in-Sind, Marmagoa and Karwar alone\r\nhave harbours sufficiently land-locked to protect shipping during the\r\nprevalence of the south-west monsoon. The coast-line is regular and\r\nlittle broken, save by the Gulfs of Cambay and Cutch, between which lies\r\nthe peninsula of Kathiawar.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mountains.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, a range of hills, known as the Western Ghats, runs\r\ndown the coast, at places rising in splendid bluffs and precipices from\r\nthe water's edge, at others retreating inland, and leaving a flat\r\nfertile strip of 5 to 50 m. between their base and the sea. In the north\r\nof the presidency on the right bank of the Indus, the Hala mountains, a\r\ncontinuation of the great Suleiman range, separate British India from\r\nthe dominions of the khan of Kalat. Leaving Sind, and passing by the\r\nridges of low sandhills,--the leading feature of the desert east of the\r\nIndus,--and the isolated hills of Cutch and Kathiawar, which form\r\ngeologically the western extremity of the Aravalli range, the first\r\nextensive mountain range is that separating Gujarat from the states of\r\ncentral India. The rugged and mountainous country south of the Tapti\r\nforms the northern extremity of the Sahyadri or Western Ghats. This\r\ngreat range of hills, sometimes overhanging the ocean, and generally\r\nrunning parallel to it at a distance nowhere exceeding 50 m., with an\r\naverage elevation of about 1800 ft., contains individual peaks rising to\r\nmore than double that height. They stretch southwards for upwards of 500\r\nm., with a breadth of 10 to 20 m. The western declivity is abrupt, the\r\nland at the base of the hills being but slightly raised above the level\r\nof the sea. As is usually the case with the trap formation, they descend\r\nto the plains in terraces with abrupt fronts. The landward slope is in\r\nmany places very gentle, the crest of the range being sometimes but\r\nslightly raised above the level of the plateau of the Deccan. Their\r\nbest-known elevation is Mahabaleshwar, 4500 ft. high, a fine plateau,\r\n37 m. from Poona, covered with rich vegetation, and used by the Bombay\r\ngovernment as its summer retreat and sanitarium. In the neighbourhood of\r\nthe Sahyadri hills, particularly towards the northern extremity of the\r\nrange, the country is rugged and broken, containing isolated peaks,\r\nmasses of rock and spurs, which, running eastward, form watersheds for\r\nthe great rivers of the Deccan. The Satpura hills separate the valley of\r\nthe Tapti from the valley of the Nerbudda, and the district of Khandesh\r\nfrom the territories of Indore. The Satmala or Ajanta hills, which are\r\nrather the northern slope of the plateau than a distinct range of hills,\r\nseparate Khandesh from the Nizam's Dominions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Plains.\r\n\r\nThe more level parts of Bombay consist of five well-demarcated\r\ntracts--Sind, Gujarat, the Konkan, the Deccan, and the Carnatic. Sind,\r\nor the lower valley of the Indus, is very flat, with but scanty\r\nvegetation, and depending for productiveness entirely on irrigation.\r\nGujarat, except on its northern parts, consists of rich, highly\r\ncultivated alluvial plains, watered by the Tapti and Nerbudda, but not\r\nmuch subject to inundation. The Konkan lies between the Western Ghats\r\nand the sea. It is a rugged and difficult country, intersected by\r\ncreeks, and abounding in isolated peaks and detached ranges of hills.\r\nThe plains of the Deccan and Khandesh are watered by large rivers, but\r\nas the rainfall is uncertain, they are generally, during the greater\r\npart of the year, bleak and devoid of vegetation. The Carnatic plain, or\r\nthe country south of the river Kistna, consists of extensive tracts of\r\nblack or cotton soil in a high state of cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rivers.\r\n\r\nThe chief river of western India is the Indus, which enters the\r\npresidency from the north of Sind and flowing south in a tortuous\r\ncourse, falls into the Arabian Sea by several mouths, such as the Ghizri\r\ncreek, Khudi creek, Pitiani creek, Sisa creek, Hajamro creek, Vatho\r\ncreek, Mall creek, Wari creek, Bhitiara creek, Sir creek and Khori\r\ncreek. In the dry season the bed varies at different places from 480 to\r\n1600 yds. The flood season begins in March and continues till September,\r\nthe average depth of the river rising from 9 to 24 ft., and the velocity\r\nof the current increasing from 3 to 7 m. an hour. Next to the Indus\r\ncomes the Nerbudda. Rising in the Central Provinces, and traversing the\r\ndominions of Holkar, the Nerbudda enters the presidency at the\r\nnorth-western extremity of the Khandesh district, flows eastward, and\r\nafter a course of 700 m. from its source, falls into the Gulf of Cambay,\r\nforming near its mouth the alluvial plain of Broach, one of the richest\r\ndistricts of Bombay. For about 100 m. from the sea the Nerbudda is at\r\nall seasons navigable by small boats, and during the rains by vessels of\r\nfrom 30 to 50 tons burden. The Tapti enters the presidency a few miles\r\nsouth of the town of Burhanpur, a station on the Great Indian Peninsula\r\nrailway, flows eastward through the district of Khandesh, the native\r\nstate of Rewa Kantha and the district of Surat, and falls into the Gulf\r\nof Cambay, a few miles west of the town of Surat. The Tapti drains about\r\n250 m. of country, and is, in a commercial point of view, the most\r\nuseful of the Gujarat rivers. Besides these there are many minor\r\nstreams. The Banas and the Saraswati take their rise in the Aravalli\r\nhills, and flowing eastward through the native state of Palanpur, fall\r\ninto the Runn of Cutch. The Sabarmati and the Mahi rise in the Mahi\r\nKantha hills, and flowing southwards, drain the districts of Northern\r\nGujarat, and fall into the sea near the head of the Gulf of Cambay. The\r\nstreams which, rising in the Sahyadri range, or Western Ghats, flow\r\nwestward into the Arabian Sea, are of little importance. During the\r\nrains they are formidable torrents, but with the return of the fair\r\nweather they dwindle away, and during the hot season, with a few\r\nexceptions, they almost dry up. Clear and rapid as they descend the\r\nhills, on reaching the lowlands of the Konkan they become muddy and\r\nbrackish creeks. The Kanarese rivers have a larger body of water and a\r\nmore regular flow than the streams of the Konkan. One of them, the\r\nSharawati, forcing its way through the western ridge of the Ghats,\r\nplunges from the high to the low country by a succession of falls, the\r\nprincipal of which is 800 ft. in height. The Sahyadri, or Western Ghats,\r\nalso throw off to the eastward the two principal rivers of the Madras\r\nPresidency, the Godavari and the Kistna. These rivers collect countless\r\ntributary streams, some of them of considerable size, and drain the\r\nentire plain of the Deccan as they pass eastward towards the Bay of\r\nBengal.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Lakes.\r\n\r\nThe Manchar Lake is situated on the right bank of the Indus. During\r\ninundations it attains a length of 20 m., and a breadth of 10, covering\r\na total area estimated at 180 sq. m. But the most peculiar lacustrine\r\nfeature of the presidency is the Runn or Lake of Cutch, which, according\r\nto the season of the year, is a salt marsh, an inland lake, or an arm of\r\nthe sea with an area of 8000 sq. m. It forms the western boundary of the\r\nprovince of Gujarat, and when flooded during the rains unites the Gulfs\r\nof Cutch and Cambay, and converts the territory of Cutch into an island.\r\n\r\n_Geology._--South of Gujarat nearly the whole of Bombay is covered by\r\nthe horizontal lava flows of the Deccan Trap series, and these flows\r\nspread over the greater part of the Kathiawar peninsula and extend into\r\nCutch. In Cutch and Kathiawar they are underlaid by Jurassic and\r\nNeocomian beds. The Jurassic beds are marine and contain numerous\r\nAmmonites, but the beds which are referred to the Neocomian include a\r\nseries of sandstones and shales with remains of plants. Several of the\r\nplants are identical with forms which occur in the upper portion of the\r\nGondwana system. Tertiary limestones, sandstones and shales overlie the\r\nDeccan Trap in Cutch, but the greatest development of deposits of this\r\nage is to be met with on the western side of the Indus (see SIND). The\r\nplain of Sind and of eastern Gujarat is covered by alluvium and\r\nwind-blown sand.\r\n\r\n_Climate._--Great varieties of climate are met with in the presidency.\r\nIn its extreme dryness and heat, combined with the aridity of a sandy\r\nsoil, Upper Sind resembles the sultry deserts of Africa. The mean\r\nmaximum temperature at Hyderabad, in Lower Sind, during the six hottest\r\nmonths of the year, is 98 deg. F. in the shade, and the water of the\r\nIndus reaches blood heat; in Upper Sind it is even hotter, and the\r\nthermometer has been known to register 130 deg. in the shade. In Cutch\r\nand in Gujarat the heat, though less, is still very great. The Konkan is\r\nhot and moist, the fall of rain during the monsoon sometimes approaching\r\n300 in. The table-land of the Deccan above the Ghats, on the contrary,\r\nhas an agreeable climate except in the hot months, as has also the\r\nsouthern Mahratta country; and in the hills of Mahabaleshwar, Singarh,\r\nand other detached heights, Europeans may go out at all hours with\r\nimpunity. Bombay Island itself, though in general cooled by the sea\r\nbreeze, is oppressively hot during May and October. The south-west\r\nmonsoon generally sets in about the first week in June, and pours down\r\nvolumes of rain along the coast. From June to October travelling is\r\ndifficult and unpleasant, except in Sind, where the monsoon rains exert\r\nlittle influence.\r\n\r\n_Forests._--Bombay Presidency possesses two great classes of\r\nforests--those of the hills and those of the alluvial plains. The hill\r\nforests are scattered over a wide area, extending from 23 deg. to 14\r\ndeg. N. lat. Most of them lie among the Sahyadri hills or Western Ghats.\r\nThe alluvial forests lie in Sind, on or close to the banks of the Indus,\r\nand extend over an area of 550 sq. m. The principal timber trees in the\r\nforests are--teak; blackwood of two varieties (_Dalbergia Sisu_ and\r\n_Dalbergia latifolia_), _Dalbergia ujainensis, Pterocarpus Marsupium,\r\nTerminalia glabra, Acacia arabica, Acacia Catechu, Nauclea cordifolia,\r\nNauclea parvifolia, Bidelia spinosa, Hardwickia binata, Juga xylocarpa,\r\nPopulus euphratica_, and _Tamarindus indica_. The forests contain many\r\ntrees which, on account of their fruits, nuts or berries, are valuable,\r\nirrespective of the quality of their timber. Among these are the mango\r\n(_Mangifera indica_); the jack (_Artocarpus integrifolia_), _Zizypkus\r\nJujuba, Aegle Marmelos, Terminalia Chebula, Calophyllum Inophyllum,\r\nBassia latifolia and Pongamia glabra_. The jungle tribes collect gum\r\nfrom several varieties of trees, and in Sind the Forest Department\r\nderives a small revenue from lac. The palms of the presidency consist of\r\ncocoa-nut, date, palmyra and areca catechu.\r\n\r\n_Population._--The census of 1901 gave a total of 25,468,209, out of\r\nwhich the chief religions furnished the following numbers:--\r\n\r\n  Hindu                19,916,438\r\n  Mahommedan            4,567,295\r\n  Jain                    535,950\r\n  Zoroastrian              78,552\r\n  Christian               216,118\r\n\r\nIn Sind Islam has been the predominant religion from the earliest Arab\r\nconquest in the 8th century. In Gujarat the predominant religion is\r\nHinduism, though petty Mahommedan kingdoms have left their influence in\r\nmany parts of the province. The Deccan is the home of the Mahrattas, who\r\nconstitute 30% of the population. The Konkan is notable for various\r\nChristian castes, owing their origin to Portuguese rule; while in the\r\nCarnatic, Lingayatism, a Hindu reformation movement of the 12th century,\r\nhas been embraced by 45% of the population. The Mahrattas are the\r\ndominating race next to the Europeans and number (1901) 3,650,000,\r\ncomposed of 1,900,000 Kunbis, 350,000 Konkanis, and 1,400,000 Mahrattas\r\nnot otherwise specified.\r\n\r\n_Languages._--The chief languages of the presidency are Sindhi in Sind,\r\nCutchi in Cutch, Gujarati and Hindustani in Gujarat, Mahratti in Thana\r\nand the central division, Gujarati and Mahratti in Khandesh, and\r\nMahratti and Kanarese in the southern division. There are also Bhil\r\n(120,000) and Gipsy (30,000) dialects.\r\n\r\n_Agriculture._--The staple crops are as follows:--Joar (_Sorghum\r\nvulgare_) and bajra (_Holcus spicatus_) are the staple food grains in\r\nthe Deccan and Khandesh. Rice is the chief product of the Konkan. Wheat,\r\ngenerally grown in the northern part of the Presidency, but specially in\r\nSind and Gujarat, is exported to Europe in large quantities from\r\nKarachi, and on a smaller scale from Bombay. Barley is principally grown\r\nin the northern parts of the presidency. Nachani (_Eleusine coracana_)\r\nand kodra (_Paspalum serobiculatum_), inferior grains grown on the\r\nhill-sides, furnish food to the Kolis, Bhils, Waralis, and other\r\naboriginal tribes. Of the pulses the most important are gram (_Cicer\r\narietinum_), tur (_Cajanus indicus_), kulti (_Dolichos biflorus_), and\r\nmug (_Phaseolus Mungo_). Principal oil-seeds: til (_Sesamum orientale_),\r\nmustard, castor-oil, safflower and linseed. Of fibres the most important\r\nare cotton, Deccan hemp (_Hibiscus cannabinus_), and sunn or tag\r\n(_Crotalaria juncea_). Much has been done to improve the cotton of the\r\npresidency. American varieties have been introduced with much advantage\r\nin the Dharwar collectorate and other parts of the southern Mahratta\r\ncountry. In Khandesh the indigenous plant from which one of the lowest\r\nclasses of cotton in the Bombay market takes its name has been almost\r\nentirely superseded by the superior Hinganghat variety. Miscellaneous\r\ncrops: sugar-cane, requiring a rich soil and a perennial water-supply,\r\nand only grown in favoured localities, red pepper, potatoes, turmeric\r\nand tobacco.\r\n\r\n_Manufactures._--The chief feature of the modern industrial life of\r\nBombay is the great development in the growth and manufacture of cotton.\r\nLarge steam mills have rapidly sprung up in Bombay City, Ahmedabad and\r\nKhandesh. In 1905 there were 432 factories in the presidency, of which\r\nby far the greater number were engaged in the preparation and\r\nmanufacture of cotton. The industry is centred in Bombay City and\r\nIsland, which contains nearly two-thirds of the mills. During the decade\r\n1891-1901 the mill industry passed through a period of depression due to\r\nwidespread plague and famine, but on the whole there has been a marked\r\nexpansion of the trade as well as a great improvement in the class of\r\ngoods produced. In addition to the mills there are (1901) 178,000\r\nhand-loom weavers in the province, who still have a position of their\r\nown in the manipulation of designs woven into the cloth. Silk goods are\r\nmanufactured in Ahmedabad, Surat, Yeola, Nasik, Thana and Bombay, the\r\nmaterial being often decorated with printed or woven designs; but owing\r\nto the competition of European goods most branches of the industry are\r\ndeclining. The custom of investing savings in gold and silver ornaments\r\ngives employment to many goldsmiths; the metal is usually supplied by\r\nthe customer, and the goldsmith charges for his labour. Ahmedabad and\r\nSurat are famous for their carved wood-work. Many of the houses in\r\nAhmedabad are covered with elaborate wood-carving, and excellent\r\nexamples exist in Broach, Baroda, Surat, Nasik and Yeola. Salt is made\r\nin large quantities in the government works at Kharaghoda and Udu in\r\nAhmedabad, whence it is exported by rail to Gujarat and central India.\r\nThere is one brewery at Dapuri near Poona.\r\n\r\n_Railways and Irrigation._--The province is well supplied with railways,\r\nall of which, with one exception, concentrate at Bombay City. The\r\nexception is the North-Western line, which enters Sind from the Punjab\r\nand finds its natural terminus at Karachi. The other chief lines are the\r\nGreat Indian Peninsula, Indian Midland, Bombay, Baroda & Central India,\r\nRajputana-Malwa & Southern Mahratta systems. In 1905 the total length of\r\nrailway under the Bombay government open for traffic was 7980 m. These\r\nfigures do not include the railway system in Sind. With the exception of\r\nSind, the water-supply of the Bombay Presidency does not lend itself to\r\nthe construction of large irrigation works.\r\n\r\n_Army._--Under Lord Kitchener's re-arrangement of the Indian army in\r\n1904 the old Bombay command was abolished and its place was taken by the\r\nWestern army corps under a lieutenant-general. The army corps was\r\ndivided into three divisions under major-generals. The 4th division,\r\nwith headquarters at Quetta, comprises the troops in the Quetta and Sind\r\ndistricts. The 5th division, with headquarters at Mhow, consists of\r\nthree brigades, located at Nasirabad, Jubbulpore and Jhansi, and\r\nincludes the previous Mhow, Deesa, Nagpur, Nerbudda and Bundelkhand\r\ndistricts, with the Bombay district north of the Tapti. The 6th\r\ndivision, with headquarters at Poona, consists of three brigades,\r\nlocated at Bombay, Ahmednagar and Aden. It comprises the previous Poona\r\ndistrict, Bombay district south of the Tapti, Belgaum district north of\r\nthe Tungabhadra, and Dharwar and Aurungabad districts.\r\n\r\n_Education._--The university of Bombay, established in 1857, is a body\r\ncorporate, consisting of a chancellor, vice-chancellor and fellows. The\r\ngovernor of Bombay is _ex officio_ chancellor. The education department\r\nis under a director of public instruction, who is responsible for the\r\nadministration of the department in accordance with the general\r\neducational policy of the state. The native states have generally\r\nadopted the government system. Baroda and the Kathiawar states employ\r\ntheir own inspectors. In 1905 the total number of educational\r\ninstitutions was 10,194 with 593,431 pupils. There are ten art colleges,\r\nof which two are managed by government, three by native states, and five\r\nare under private management. According to the census of 1901, out of a\r\npopulation of 25-1/2 millions nearly 24 millions were illiterate.\r\n\r\n_Administration._--The government of Bombay is administered by a\r\ngovernor in council consisting of the governor as president and two\r\nordinary members. The governor is appointed from England; the council is\r\nappointed by the crown, and selected from the Indian civil service.\r\nThese are the executive members of government. For making laws there is\r\na legislative council, consisting of the governor and his executive\r\ncouncil, with certain other persons, not fewer than eight or more than\r\ntwenty, at least half of them being non-officials. Each of the members\r\nof the executive council has in his charge one or two departments of the\r\ngovernment; and each department has a secretary, an under-secretary, and\r\nan assistant secretary, with a numerous staff of clerks. The political\r\nadministration of the native states is under the superintendence of\r\nBritish agents placed at the principal native courts; their position\r\nvaries in different states according to the relations in which the\r\nprincipalities stand with the paramount power. The administration of\r\njustice throughout the presidency is conducted by a high court at\r\nBombay, consisting of a chief justice and seven puisne judges, along\r\nwith district and assistant judges throughout the districts of the\r\npresidency. The administration of the districts is carried on by\r\ncollectors, assistant collectors, and a varying number of supernumerary\r\nassistants.\r\n\r\n_History._--In the earliest times of which any record remains the\r\ngreater part of the west coast of India was occupied by Dravidian\r\ntribes, living under their kings in fortified villages, carrying on the\r\nsimpler arts of life, and holding a faith in which the propitiation of\r\nspirits and demons played the chief part. There is evidence, however,\r\nthat so early as 1000 B.C. an export trade existed to the Red Sea by way\r\nof East Africa, and before 750 B.C. a similar trade had sprung up with\r\nBabylon by way of the Persian Gulf. It was by this latter route that the\r\ntraders brought back to India the Brahmi alphabet, the art of\r\nbrick-making and the legend of the Flood. Later still the settlement of\r\nBrahmans along the west coast had already Aryanized the country in\r\nreligion, and to some extent in language, before the Persian conquest of\r\nthe Indus valley at the close of the 6th century B.C. The Persian\r\ndominion did not long survive; and the march of Alexander the Great down\r\nthe Indus paved the way for Chandragupta and the Maurya empire. Under\r\nthis empire Ujjain was the seat of a viceroy, a prince of the imperial\r\nhouse, who ruled over Kathiawar, Malwa and Gujarat. On the death of\r\nAsoka in 231 B.C. the empire of the Mauryas broke up, and their heritage\r\nin the west fell to the Andhra dynasty of the Satavahanas of Paithan on\r\nthe Godavari, a Dravidian family whose dominion by 200 B.C. stretched\r\nacross the peninsula from the deltas of the Godavari and Kistna to Nasik\r\nand the Western Ghats. About A.D. 210, however, their power in the west\r\nseems to have died out, and their place was taken by the foreign dynasty\r\nof the Kshaharatas, the Saka satraps of Surashtra (Kathiawar), who in\r\n120 had mastered Ujjain and Gujarat and had built up a rival kingdom to\r\nthe north. Since about A.D. 40 the coast cities had been much enriched\r\nby trade with the Roman empire, which both the Satavahanas and the\r\nsatraps did much to encourage; but after the fall of Palmyra (273) and\r\nthe extinction of the main Kshaharata dynasty (c. 300) this commerce\r\nfell into decay. The history of the century and a half that follows is\r\nvery obscure; short-lived Saka dynasties succeeded one another until,\r\nabout 388, the country was conquered by the Guptas of Magadha, who kept\r\na precarious tenure of it till about 470, when their empire was\r\ndestroyed by the White Huns, or Ephthalites (q.v.), who, after\r\nbreaking the power of Persia and assailing the Kushan kingdom of Kabul,\r\npoured into India, conquered Sind, and established their dominion as far\r\nsouth as the Nerbudda.\r\n\r\nUnder the Hun tyranny, which lasted till the overthrow of the White Huns\r\non the Oxus by the Turks (c. 565), native dynasties had survived, or new\r\nones had established themselves. In Kathiawar a chief named Bhatarka,\r\nprobably of foreign origin, had established himself at Valabhi (Wala) on\r\nthe ruins of the Gupta power (c. 500), and founded a dynasty which\r\nlasted until it was overthrown by Arab invaders from Sind in 770.[1] The\r\nnorthern Konkan was held by the Mauryas of Puri near Bombay, the\r\nsoutherly coast by the Kadambas of Vanavasi, while in the southern\r\nDeccan Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas struggled for the mastery. A new\r\npower, too, appeared from the north: the Gurjaras (ancestors, it is\r\nsupposed, of the Gujar caste), who had probably entered India with the\r\nWhite Huns, established their power over Gujarat and (c. 600) overran\r\nnorth-eastern Kathiawar, made the raja of Valabhi their tributary, and\r\nestablished a branch at Broach (585-740). During the short-lived empire\r\nof Harsha (d. 647 or 648), Malwa, Gujarat and Kathiawar were subject to\r\nhis sway; but the southern boundary of his kingdom was the Nerbudda,\r\nsouth of which the Chalukyas in the 7th century, having overcome the\r\nRashtrakutas and other rivals, had absorbed the smaller kingdoms into\r\ntheir empire. In 710-711 (92 A.H.) the Arabs invaded India, and in 712\r\nconquered and established themselves in Sind; they did not, however,\r\nattempt any serious attack on the Gurjara and Chalukya empires,\r\nconfining themselves to more or less serious raids. In 770 they\r\ndestroyed the city of Valabhi and, as already mentioned, brought its\r\ndynasty to an end. Meanwhile the Chalukyas, after successfully\r\nstruggling with the Pallavas (whose capital was taken by Vikramaditya\r\nII., c. 740), had in their turn succumbed to their ancient rivals the\r\nRashtrakutas, who succeeded to the bulk of their dominions, including\r\nGujarat, where they had set up a branch line. For some two centuries (c.\r\n750-950) there was a balance of power between the Gurjaras and\r\nRashtrakutas, neither kingdom being strong enough to encroach on the\r\nother to any extent. The Rashtrakutas were, moreover, debarred from\r\nlarge schemes of conquest by dissensions with the branch dynasty which\r\nthey had set up in Gujarat and by the constant threat of attack by the\r\nChalukyas from Mysore. Nevertheless their power and magnificence (they\r\nwere notable builders and patrons of literature) greatly impressed the\r\nArabs, by whom the king was known as Balhara (_i.e. Vallhaba_,\r\n\"well-beloved\"), a title borrowed from the preceding dynasty. Under them\r\nthe Konkan and the coast farther south were governed by chiefs of the\r\nSilahara family, whose rule is mainly notable for the revival of trade\r\nwith the Persian Gulf and, doubtless as a result of this, the arrival in\r\n775 on the west coast of a number of Parsee refugees, who found, in a\r\ncountry where three religions were already equally honoured, the\r\ntoleration denied to them in Mussulman Persia. But in the 10th century\r\nthe Rashtrakuta power began to break up; in 961 Mularaja Solanki\r\n(Chalukya) conquered the kingdom of Anhilvada (Anhilvara) in Gujarat,\r\nwhere his dynasty reigned till 1242; and twelve years later the\r\nChalukyas once more overthrew the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan,\r\nestablishing their capital at Kalyani, while a branch line was set up in\r\nsouthern Gujarat. Farther south the Silaharas, however, continued to\r\nrule the coast, and succeeded in maintaining their independence until\r\nafter the final fall of the Chalukyas in 1192. The cause of the downfall\r\nof the dynasty, splendid and enlightened as any of its predecessors, was\r\nthe system of governing by means of great feudatories, which also proved\r\nfatal to the Solanki rajas of Anhilvada. From 1143 onward the power of\r\nthe latter had been overshadowed by that of the Vaghela chiefs of\r\nDholka, and during the same period the Deccan had been rapidly lapsing\r\ninto absolute anarchy, amid which rival chiefs struggled for the supreme\r\npower. In the end the Yadavas of Devagiri (Daulatabad) prevailed, and in\r\n1192 established a short-lived empire to which the Dholka princes were\r\nultimately forced to become tributary.\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile a new power had appeared, which was destined to establish\r\nthe Mussulman domination in western and southern India. In 1023 Mahmud\r\nof Ghazni had already invaded Gujarat with a large army, destroyed the\r\nnational Hindu idol of Somnath, and carried away an immense booty.\r\nMahommed Ghori also invaded Gujarat, and left a garrison in its capital.\r\nBut it was not till after the Mussulman power was firmly established in\r\nnorthern India that the Mahommedan sovereigns of Delhi attempted the\r\nconquest of the south. In 1294 the emperor Ala-ud-din first invaded the\r\nDeccan, and in 1297 he conquered Gujarat. In 1312 the Mahommedan arms\r\nwere triumphant through the Mahratta country; and seven years later the\r\nwhole of Malabar fell a prey to the invaders. In the middle of the 14th\r\ncentury the weakness of the Delhi sovereigns tempted the governors of\r\nprovinces to revolt against their distant master, and to form\r\nindependent kingdoms. In this way the Bahmani kingdom was established in\r\nthe Deccan, and embraced a part of the Bombay presidency. Ahmednagar and\r\nGujarat also became the seats of a new kingdom. In 1573 Akbar conquered\r\nGujarat and reannexed it to the empire; in 1599 he effected the\r\nreconquest of Khandesh, and in 1600 that of Ahmednagar. From this time\r\nthe country was never tranquil, and Ahmednagar became the focus of\r\nconstant rebellions. During the latter part of the 17th century the\r\nMahrattas rose into power, and almost every part of the country now\r\ncomprising the presidency of Bombay fell under their sway. In 1498 the\r\nPortuguese came first to Calicut, their earliest possession in the\r\npresidency being the island of Anjidiv. After their victory at Diu over\r\nthe Egyptian fleet their mastery of the Indian Ocean was undisputed, and\r\nthey proceeded to establish themselves on the coast. They captured Goa\r\nin 1510, Malacca in 1511, and Ormuz in 1515. They next took advantage of\r\nthe decay of the kingdom of Gujarat to occupy Chaul (1531), Bassein with\r\nits dependencies, including Bombay (1534), Diu (1535) and Daman (1559).\r\nBut the inherent vices of their intolerant system undermined their\r\npower, even before their Dutch and English rivals appeared on the scene.\r\n\r\nThe first English settlement in the Bombay presidency was in 1618, when\r\nthe East India Company established a factory at Surat, protected by a\r\ncharter obtained from the emperor Jahangir. In 1626 the Dutch and\r\nEnglish made an unsuccessful attempt to gain possession of the island of\r\nBombay, and in 1653 proposals were suggested for its purchase from the\r\nPortuguese. In 1661 it was ceded to the English crown, as part of the\r\ndower of the infanta Catherine of Portugal on her marriage with Charles\r\nII. So lightly was the acquisition esteemed in England, and so\r\nunsuccessful was the administration of the crown officers, that in 1668\r\nBombay was transferred to the East India Company for an annual payment\r\nof L10. At the time of the transfer, powers for its defence and for the\r\nadministration of justice were also conferred; a European regiment Vas\r\nenrolled; and the fortifications erected proved sufficient to deter the\r\nDutch from their intended attack in 1673 (see BOMBAY CITY: History). In\r\n1687 Bombay was placed at the head of all the Company's possessions in\r\nIndia; but in 1753 the government of Bombay became subordinate to that\r\nof Calcutta. The first collision of the English with the Mahratta power\r\nwas in 1774 and resulted in 1782 in the treaty of Salbai, by which\r\nSalsette was ceded to the British, while Broach was handed over to\r\nSindhia. More important were the results of the second Mahratta war,\r\nwhich ended in 1803. Surat had already been annexed in 1800; the East\r\nIndia Company now received the districts of Broach, Kaira, &c.\r\n\r\nIn 1803 the Bombay presidency included only Salsette, the islands of the\r\nharbour (since 1774), Surat and Bankot (since 1756); but between this\r\ndate and 1827 the framework of the presidency took its present shape.\r\nThe Gujarat districts were taken over by the Bombay government in 1805\r\nand enlarged in 1818; and the first measures for the settlement of\r\nKathiawar and Mahi Kantha were taken between 1807 and 1820. Baji Rao,\r\nthe last of the peshwas, who had attempted to shake off the British\r\nyoke, was defeated, captured and pensioned (1817-1818), and large\r\nportions of his dominions (Poona, Ahmednagar, Nasik, Sholapur, Belgaum,\r\nKaladgi, Dharwar, &c.) were included in the presidency, the settlement\r\nof which was completed by Mountstuart Elphinstone, governor from 1819 to\r\n1827. His policy was to rule as far as possible on native lines,\r\navoiding all changes for which the population was not yet ripe; but the\r\ngrosser abuses of the old regime were stopped, the country was pacified,\r\nthe laws were codified, and courts and schools were established. The\r\nperiod that followed is notable mainly for the enlargement of the\r\npresidency through the lapse of certain native states, by the addition\r\nof Aden (1839) and Sind (1843), and the lease of the Panch Mahals from\r\nSindhia (1853). The establishment of an orderly administration, one\r\noutcome of which was a general fall of prices that made the unwonted\r\nregularity of the collection of taxes doubly unwelcome, naturally\r\nexcited a certain amount of misgiving and resentment; but on the whole\r\nthe population was prosperous and contented, and under Lord Elphinstone\r\n(1853-1860) the presidency passed through the crisis of the Mutiny\r\nwithout any general rising. Outbreaks among the troops at Karachi,\r\nAhmedabad and Kolhapur were quickly put down, two regiments being\r\ndisbanded, and the rebellions in Gujarat, among the Bhils, and in the\r\nsouthern Mahratta country were local and isolated. Under Sir Bartle\r\nFrere (1862-1867) agricultural prosperity reached its highest point, as\r\na result of the American Civil War and the consequent enormous demand\r\nfor Indian cotton in Europe. The money thus poured into the country\r\nproduced an epidemic of speculation known as the \"Share Mania\"\r\n(1864-1865), which ended in a commercial crisis and the failure of the\r\nbank of Bombay (1866). But the peasantry gained on the whole more than\r\nthey lost, and the trade of Bombay was not permanently injured. Sir\r\nBartle Frere encouraged the completion of the great trunk lines of\r\nrailways, and with the funds obtained by the demolition of the town\r\nwalls (1862) he began the magnificent series of public buildings that\r\nnow adorn Bombay.\r\n\r\nDuring recent times the entire history of Bombay has been sadly affected\r\nby plague and famine. Bubonic plague, of a fatal and contagious nature,\r\nfirst broke out in Bombay City in September 1896, and, despite all the\r\nefforts of the government, quickly spread to the surrounding country.\r\nDown to the end of October 1902 over 531,000 deaths had taken place due\r\nto plague. In 1903-1904 there were 426,387 cases with 316,523 deaths,\r\nand 1904-1905 there were 285,897 cases with 212,948 deaths. The great\r\ncities of Bombay, Karachi and Poona suffered most severely. A few\r\ndistricts in Gujarat almost entirely escaped; but the mortality was very\r\nheavy in Satara, Thana, Surat, Poona, Kolaba, and in the native states\r\nof Cutch, Baroda, Kolhapur and Palanpur. The only sanitary measure that\r\ncan be said to have been successful was complete migration, which could\r\nonly be adopted in villages and smaller towns. Inoculation was\r\nextensively tried in some cases. Segregation was the one general method\r\nof fighting the disease; but, unfortunately, it was misunderstood by the\r\npeople and led to some deplorable outbreaks. In Poona, during 1897, two\r\nEuropean officials were assassinated; the editor of a prominent native\r\npaper was sentenced to imprisonment for sedition; and two leaders of the\r\nBrahman community were placed in confinement. At Bombay, in March 1898,\r\na riot begun by Mahommedan weavers was not suppressed until several\r\nEuropeans had been fatally injured. In Nasik district, in January 1898,\r\nthe native chairman of the plague committee was brutally murdered by a\r\nmob. But on the whole the people submitted with characteristic docility\r\nto the sanitary regulations of the government. Bombay, like the Central\r\nProvinces, suffered from famine twice within three years. The failure of\r\nthe monsoon of 1896 caused widespread distress throughout the Deccan,\r\nover an area of 46,000 sq. m., with a population of 7 millions. The\r\nlargest number of persons on relief was 301,056 in September 1897; and\r\nthe total expenditure on famine relief was Rs. 1,28,000,000. The\r\nmeasures adopted were signally successful, both in saving life and in\r\nmitigating distress. In 1899 the monsoon again failed in Gujarat, where\r\nfamine hitherto had been almost unknown; and the winter rains failed in\r\nthe Deccan, so that distress gradually spread over almost the entire\r\npresidency. The worst feature was a virulent outbreak of cholera in\r\nGujarat, especially in the native states. In April 1900 the total number\r\nof persons in receipt of relief was 1,281,159 in British districts,\r\n566,671 in native states, and 71,734 in Baroda. For 1900-1901 the total\r\nexpenditure on famine relief was nearly 3 crores (say, L2,000,000\r\nsterling); and a continuance of drought necessitated an estimate of 1\r\ncrore in the budget of the following year. The Bombay government\r\nexhausted its balances in 1897, and was subsequently dependent on grants\r\nfrom the government of India.\r\n\r\n  See Sir James Campbell, _Gazetteer of Bombay_ (26 vols., 1896); S.M.\r\n  Edwardes, _The Rise of Bombay_ (1902); James Douglas, _Bombay and\r\n  Western India_ (1893); and Sir William Lee-Warner, _The Presidency of\r\n  Bombay_ (Society of Arts, 1904); _The Imperial Gazetteer of India_\r\n  (Oxford, 1908); and for the early history, V.A.

Good\r\nbombazine is made with a silk warp and a worsted weft. It is twilled or\r\ncorded and used for dress-material. Black bombazine has been used\r\nlargely for mourning, but the material has gone out of fashion. The word\r\nis derived from the obsolete French _bombasin_, applied originally to\r\nsilk but afterwards to \"tree-silk\" or cotton. Bombazine is said to have\r\nbeen made in England in Queen Elizabeth's reign, and early in the 19th\r\ncentury it was largely made at Norwich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOMBELLES, MARC MARIE, MARQUIS DE (1744-1822), French diplomatist and\r\necclesiastic, was the son of the comte de Bombelles, tutor and guardian\r\nof the duke of Orleans. He was born at Bitsch in Lorraine, and served in\r\nthe army through the Seven Years' War. In 1765 he entered the diplomatic\r\nservice, and after several diplomatic missions became ambassador of\r\nFrance to Portugal in 1786, being charged to win over that country to\r\nthe Family Compact; but the madness of the queen and then the death of\r\nthe king prevented his success. He was transferred to Vienna early in\r\n1789, but the Revolution cut short his diplomatic career, and he was\r\ndeprived of his post in September 1790. He remained attached to Louis\r\nXVI., and was employed on secret missions to other sovereigns, to gain\r\ntheir aid for Louis. In 1792 he emigrated, and after Valmy lived in\r\nretirement in Switzerland. In 1804, after the death of his wife, he\r\nwithdrew to the monastery of Brunn in Austria, and became bishop of\r\nOberglogau in Prussia. In 1815 he returned to France, and became bishop\r\nof Amiens (1819). He died in Paris in 1822.\r\n\r\nHis son, LOUIS PHILIPPE, comte de Bombelles (1780-1843), born at\r\nRegensburg, passed his life in the diplomatic service of Austria. In\r\n1814 he became Austrian ambassador to Denmark, and in 1816 filled a\r\nsimilar position at Dresden.     (E. Es.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOMBERG, DANIEL, a famous Christian printer of Hebrew books. His chief\r\nactivity was in Venice between 1516 and 1549 (the year of his death).\r\nBomberg introduced a new era in Hebrew typography. Among other great\r\nenterprises, he published the _editio princeps_ (1516-1517) of the\r\nrabbinical Bible (Hebrew text with rabbinical commentaries, &c.). He\r\nalso produced the first complete edition of the Talmud (1520-1523).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONA, JOHN (1609-1674), Italian cardinal and author, was born at Mondovi\r\nin Piedmont, on the 10th of October 1609. In 1624 he joined the\r\nCongregation of Feuillants and was successively elected prior of Asti,\r\nabbot of Mondovi and general of his order. He was created cardinal in\r\n1669 by Clement IX., and during the conclave, which followed that pope's\r\ndeath, was regarded as a possible candidate for the papacy. He died on\r\nthe 27th of October 1674. Bona's writings are mainly concerned with\r\nliturgical and devotional subjects. Of the numerous editions of his\r\nworks, the best are those of Paris (1677), Turin (1747) and Antwerp\r\n(1777). Stores of interesting rubrical information, interspersed with\r\nverses and prayers, are to be found in the _De Libris Liturgicis_ and\r\nthe _Divina Psalmodia_; recent advances in liturgical studies, however,\r\nhave somewhat lessened their value. The _De Discretione Spirituum_\r\ntreats of certain higher phases of mysticism; the _Via Compendii ad\r\nDeum_ was well translated in 1876 by Henry Collins, O. Cist., under the\r\ntitle of _An Easy Way to God_. Sir Roger L'Estrange's translation (_The\r\nGuide to Heaven_, 1680) of the _Manuductio ad Coelum_ was reprinted in\r\n1898, and a new edition of the _Principia Vitae Christianae_, ed. by D.\r\nO'Connor, appeared in 1906. The devotional treatise _De Sacrificio\r\nMissae_ is the classical work in its field (new edition by Ildephonsus\r\nCummins, 1903).\r\n\r\n  The chief source for the life of Bona is the biography by the\r\n  Cistercian abbot Bertolotti (Asti, 1677); the best modern study is by\r\n  A. Ighina (Mondovi, 1874).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONA (BONE), a seaport of Algeria, in 36 deg. 53' N., 7 deg. 46' E., on\r\na bay of the Mediterranean, chief town of an arrondissement in the\r\ndepartment of Constantine, 220 m. by rail W. of Tunis, and 136 m. N.E.\r\nof Constantine. The town, which is situated at the foot of the wooded\r\nheights of Edugh, is surrounded with a modern rampart erected outside\r\nthe old Arab wall, the compass of which was found too small for its\r\ngrowth. Much of the old town has been demolished, and its general\r\ncharacter now is that of a flourishing French city. The streets are wide\r\nand well laid out, but some are very steep. Through the centre of the\r\ntown runs a broad tree-lined promenade, the Cours Jerome-Bertagna,\r\nformerly the Cours National, in which are the principal buildings\r\n--theatre, banks, hotels. At its southern end, by the quay, is a bronze\r\nstatue of Thiers, and at the northern end, the cathedral of St\r\nAugustine, a large church built in quasi-Byzantine style. In it is\r\npreserved a relic supposed to be the right arm of St Augustine, brought\r\nfrom Pavia in 1842. The Grand Mosque, built out of ruins of the ancient\r\nHippo, occupies one side of the chief square, the Place d'Armes. There\r\nare barracks with accommodation for 3000 men, and civil and military\r\nhospitals. The Kasbah (citadel) stands on a hill at the north-east of\r\nthe town. The inner harbour, covering 25 acres, is surrounded by fine\r\nquays at which vessels drawing 22 ft. can be moored. Beyond is a\r\nspacious outer harbour, built 1857-1868 and enlarged in 1905-1907. Bona\r\nis in direct steamship communication with Marseilles, and is the centre\r\nof a large commerce, ranking after Algiers and Oran alone in Algeria. It\r\nimports general merchandise and manufactures, and exports phosphates,\r\niron, zinc, barley, sheep, wool, cork, esparto, &c. There are\r\nmanufactories of native garments, tapestry and leather. The marshes at\r\nthe mouths of the Seybuse and Bujema rivers, which enter the sea to the\r\nsouth of Bona, have been drained by a system of canals, to the\r\nimprovement of the sanitary condition of the town, which has the further\r\nadvantage of an abundant water supply obtained from the Edugh hills.\r\nThere are cork woods and marble quarries in the vicinity, and the valley\r\nof the Seybuse and the neighbouring plains are rich in agricultural\r\nproduce. The population of the town of Bona in 1906 was 36,004, of the\r\ncommune 42,934, of the arrondissement, which includes La Calle (q.v.)\r\nand 11 other communes, 77,803.\r\n\r\nBona is identified with the ancient _Aphrodisium_, the seaport of _Hippo\r\nRegius_ or _Ubbo_, but it derives its name from the latter city, the\r\nruins of which, consisting of large cisterns, now restored, and\r\nfragments of walls, are about a mile to the south of the town. In the\r\nfirst three centuries of the Christian era Hippo was one of the richest\r\ncities in Roman Africa; but its chief title to fame is derived from its\r\nconnexion with St Augustine, who lived here as priest and bishop for\r\nthirty-five years. Hippo was captured by the Vandals under Genseric in\r\n431, after a siege of fourteen months, during which Augustine died. Only\r\nthe cathedral, together with Augustine's library and MSS., escaped the\r\ngeneral destruction. The town Avas partially restored by Belisarius, and\r\nagain sacked by the Arabs in the 7th century. On the top of the hill on\r\nwhich Hippo stood, a large basilica, with chancel towards the west,\r\ndedicated to St Augustine, was opened in 1900. An altar surmounted by a\r\nbronze statue of the saint has also been erected among the ruins. The\r\nplace was named Hippo Regius (Royal) by the Romans because it was a\r\nfavourite residence of the Numidian kings. Bona (Arabic _annaba_, \"the\r\ncity of jujube trees\"), which has passed through many vicissitudes, was\r\nbuilt by the Arabs, and was for centuries a possession of the rulers of\r\nTunis, who built the Kasbah in 1300. From the beginning of the 14th to\r\nthe middle of the 15th century it was frequented by Italians and\r\nSpaniards, and in the 16th it was held for some time by Charles V., who\r\nstrengthened its citadel. Thereafter it was held in turn by Genoese,\r\nTunisians and Algerines. From the time of Louis XIV. to the Revolution,\r\nthe French _Compagnie d'Afrique_ maintained a very active trade with the\r\nport. The town was occupied by the French for a few months in 1830 and\r\nreoccupied in 1832, when Captains Armandy and Yusuf with a small force\r\nof marines seized the Kasbah and held it for some months until help\r\narrived. From that time the history of Bona is one of industrial\r\ndevelopment, greatly stimulated since 1883 by the discovery of the\r\nphosphate beds at Tebessa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONA DEA, the \"good goddess,\" an old Roman deity of fruitfulness, both\r\nin the earth and in women. She was identified with Fauna, and by later\r\nsyncretism also with Ops and Maia--the latter no doubt because the\r\ndedication-day of her temple on the Aventine was 1st May (Ovid, _Fasti_,\r\nv. 149 foll.). This temple was cared for, and the cult attended, by\r\nwomen only, and the same was the case at a second celebration at the\r\nbeginning of December in the house of a magistrate with _imperium_,\r\nwhich became famous owing to the profanation of these mysteries by P.\r\nClodius in 62 B.C., and the political consequences of his act. Wine and\r\nmyrtle were tabooed in the cult of this deity, and myths grew up to\r\nexplain these features of the cult, of which an account may be read in\r\nW.W. Fowler's _Roman Festivals_, pp. 103 foll. Herbs with healing\r\nproperties were kept in her temple, and also snakes, the usual symbol of\r\nthe medicinal art. Her victim was a porca, as in the cults of other\r\ndeities of fertility, and was called _damium_, and we are told that the\r\ngoddess herself was known as Damia and her priestess as _damiatrix_.\r\nThese names are almost certainly Greek; Damia is found worshipped at\r\nseveral places in Greece, and also at Tarentum, where there was a\r\nfestival called _Dameia_. It is thus highly probable that on the cult of\r\nthe original Roman goddess was engrafted the Greek one of Damia,\r\nperhaps after the conquest of Tarentum (272 B.C.). It is no longer\r\npossible to distinguish clearly the Greek and Roman elements in this\r\ncurious cult, though it is itself quite intelligible as that of an\r\nEarth-goddess with mysteries attached.\r\n\r\n  See also Pauly-Wissowa, _Realencyclopadie_.     (W. W. F.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONA FIDE (Lat. \"in good faith\"), in law, a term implying the absence of\r\nall fraud or unfair dealing or acting. It is usually employed in\r\nconjunction with a noun, e.g. \"bona fide purchaser,\" one who has\r\npurchased property from its legal owner, to whom he has paid the\r\nconsideration, and from whom he has taken a legal conveyance, without\r\nhaving any notice of any trust affecting the property; \"bona fide\r\nholder\" of a bill of exchange, one who has taken a bill complete and\r\nregular on the face of it, before it was overdue, and in good faith and\r\nfor value, and without notice of any defect in the title of the person\r\nwho negotiated it to him; \"bona fide traveller\" under the licensing\r\nacts, one whose lodging-place during the preceding night is at least 3\r\nm. distant from the place where he demands to be supplied with liquor,\r\nsuch distance being calculated by the nearest public thoroughfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONALD, LOUIS GABRIEL AMBROISE, VICOMTE DE (1754-1840), French\r\nphilosopher and politician, was born at Le Monna, near Millau in\r\nAveyron, on the 2nd of October 1754. Disliking the principles of the\r\nRevolution, he emigrated in 1791, joined the army of the prince of\r\nConde, and soon afterwards settled at Heidelberg. There he wrote his\r\nfirst important work, the highly conservative _Theorie du pouvoir\r\npolitique et religieux_ (3 vols., 1796; new ed., Paris, 1854, 2 vols.),\r\nwhich was condemned by the Directory. Returning to France he found\r\nhimself an object of suspicion, and was obliged to live in retirement.\r\nIn 1806 he was associated with Chateaubriand and Fievee in the conduct\r\nof the _Mercure de France_, and two years later was appointed councillor\r\nof the Imperial University which he had often attacked. After the\r\nrestoration he was a member of the council of public instruction, and\r\nfrom 1815 to 1822 sat in the chamber as deputy. His speeches were on the\r\nextreme conservative side; he even advocated a literary censorship. In\r\n1822 he was made minister of state, and presided over the censorship\r\ncommission. In the following year he was made a peer, a dignity which he\r\nlost through refusing to take the oath in 1830. From 1816 he had been a\r\nmember of the Academy. He took no part in public affairs after 1830, but\r\nretired to his seat at Le Monna, where he died on the 23rd of November\r\n1840.\r\n\r\nBonald was one of the leading writers of the theocratic or\r\ntraditionalist school, which included de Maistre, Lamennais, Ballanche\r\nand d'Eckstein. His writings are mainly on social and political\r\nphilosophy, and are based ultimately on one great principle, the divine\r\norigin of language. In his own words, \"L'homme pense sa parole avant de\r\nparler sa pensee\"; the first language contained the essence of all\r\ntruth. From this he deduces the existence of God, the divine origin and\r\nconsequent supreme authority of the Holy Scriptures, and the\r\ninfallibility of the church. While this thought lies at the root of all\r\nhis speculations there is a formula of constant application. All\r\nrelations may be stated as the triad of cause, means and effect, which\r\nhe sees repeated throughout nature. Thus, in the universe, he finds the\r\nfirst cause as mover, movement as the means, and bodies as the result;\r\nin the state, power as the cause, ministers as the means, and subjects\r\nas the effects; in the family, the same relation is exemplified by\r\nfather, mother and children. These three terms bear specific relations\r\nto one another; the first is to the second as the second to the third.\r\nThus, in the great triad of the religious world--God, the Mediator, and\r\nMan-God is to the God-Man as the God-Man is to Man. On this basis he\r\nconstructed a system of political absolutism which lacks two things\r\nonly:--well-grounded premisses instead of baseless hypotheses, and the\r\nacquiescence of those who were to be subjected to it.\r\n\r\nBonald's style is remarkably fine; ornate, but pure and vigorous. Many\r\nfruitful thoughts are scattered among his works, but his system scarcely\r\ndeserves the name of a philosophy. In abstract thought he was a mere\r\ndilettante, and his strength lay in the vigour and sincerity of his\r\nstatements rather than in cogency of reasoning.\r\n\r\nHe had four sons. Of these, VICTOR DE BONALD (1780-1871) followed his\r\nfather in his exile, was rector of the academy of Montpellier after the\r\nrestoration, but lost his post during the Hundred Days. Regaining it at\r\nthe second restoration, he resigned finally in 1830. He wrote _Des vrais\r\nprincipes opposes aux erreurs du XIXe siecle_ (1833), _Moise et les\r\ngeologues modernes_ (1835), and a life of his father. LOUIS JACQUES\r\nMAURICE (1787-1870), cardinal (1841), was condemned by the council of\r\nstate for a pastoral letter attacking Dupin the elder's _Manuel de droit\r\necclesiastique_. In 1848 he held a memorial service \"for those who fell\r\ngloriously in defence of civil and religious liberty.\" In 1851 he\r\nnevertheless advocated in the senate the maintenance of the temporal\r\npower of Rome by force of arms. HENRI (d. 1846) was a contributor to\r\nlegitimist journals; and RENE was interim prefect of Aveyron in 1817.\r\n\r\n  Besides the _Theorie_ above mentioned, the vicomte de Bonald published\r\n  _Essai analytique sur les lois naturelles de l'ordre social_ (1800);\r\n  _Legislation primitive_ (1802); _Du divorce considere au XIXe siecle_\r\n  (1801); _Recherches philosophiques sur les premiers objets de\r\n  connaissances morales_ (2 vols., 1818); _Melanges litteraires et\r\n  politiques, demonstration philosophique du principe constitutif de la\r\n  societe_ (1819, 1852). The first collected edition appeared in 12\r\n  vols., 1817-1819; the latest is that of the Abbe Migne (3 vols.,\r\n  1859).\r\n\r\n  See _Notice sur M. le Vicomte de Bonald_ (1841, ed. Avignon, 1853),\r\n  (by his son Victor); Damiron, _Phil. en France au XIXe siecle_;\r\n  Windelband, _History of Philosophy_ (trans. J.H. Tufts, 1893); E.\r\n  Faguet in _Rev. des deux mondes_ (April 15, 1889).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONAPARTE, the name of a family made famous by Napoleon I. (q.v.),\r\nemperor of the French. The French form Bonaparte was not commonly used,\r\neven by Napoleon, until after the spring of 1796. The original name was\r\nBuonaparte, which was borne in the early middle ages by several distinct\r\nfamilies in Italy. One of these, which settled at Florence before the\r\nyear 1100, divided in the 13th century into the two branches of San\r\nMiniato and Sarzana. A member of this latter, Francesco Buonaparte,\r\nemigrated in the middle of the 16th century to Corsica, where his\r\ndescendants continued to occupy themselves with the affairs of law and\r\nthe magistracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Napoleon's father and mother.\r\n\r\nCARLO BUONAPARTE [Charles Marie de Bonaparte] (1746-1785), the father of\r\nNapoleon I., took his degree in law at the university of Pisa, and after\r\nthe conquest of Corsica by the French became assessor to the royal court\r\nof Ajaccio and the neighbouring districts. His restless and dissatisfied\r\nnature led him to press or intrigue for other posts, and to embark in\r\nrisky business enterprises which compromised the fortune of his family\r\nfor many years to come. In 1764 he married Letizia Ramolino, a beautiful\r\nand high-spirited girl, aged fourteen, descended from a well-connected\r\nfamily domiciled in Corsica since the middle of the 15th century. The\r\nfirst two children, born in 1765 and 1767, died in infancy; Joseph (see\r\nbelow), the first son who survived, was born in 1768, and Napoleon in\r\n1769. The latter was born in the midst of the troubles consequent on the\r\nFrench conquest, Letizia having recently accompanied her husband in\r\nseveral journeys and escapes. Her firm and courageous disposition showed\r\nitself at that trying time and throughout the whole of her singularly\r\nvaried career. Simple and frugal in her tastes, and devout in thought\r\nand manner of life, she helped to bind her children to the life of\r\nCorsica, while her husband, a schemer by nature and a Voltairian by\r\nconviction, pointed the way to careers in France, the opening up of\r\nwhich moulded the fortunes of the family and the destinies of Europe. He\r\ndied of cancer in the stomach at Montpellier in 1785.\r\n\r\nLetizia lived to witness the glory and the downfall of her great son,\r\nsurviving Napoleon I. by sixteen years. She never accommodated herself\r\nto the part she was called on to play during the Empire, and, though\r\nendowed with immense wealth and distinguished by the title of _Madame\r\nMere_, lived mainly in retirement, and in the exercise of a strict\r\ndomestic economy which her early privations had made a second nature to\r\nher, but which rendered her very unpopular in France and was displeasing\r\nto Napoleon. After the events of 1814 she joined the emperor in the\r\nisland of Elba and was privy to his plans of escape, returning to Paris\r\nduring the Hundred Days. After the final downfall of Waterloo, she took\r\nup her residence at Rome, where Pope Pius VII. treated her with great\r\nkindness and consideration, and protected her from the suspicious\r\nattentions of the powers of the Grand Alliance. In 1818 she addressed a\r\npathetic letter to the powers assembled at the congress of Aix,\r\npetitioning for Napoleon's release, on the ground that his mortal\r\nillness had removed any possibility of his ever again becoming a menace\r\nto the world's peace. The letter remained unanswered, the powers having\r\nreason to believe that it was a mere political move, and that its terms\r\nhad been previously concerted with Napoleon. Henceforth, saddened by the\r\ndeath of Napoleon, of her daughters Pauline and Elisa, and of several\r\ngrandchildren, she lived a life of mournful seclusion. In 1829 she was\r\ncrippled by a serious fall, and was all but blind before her death in\r\n1836.\r\n\r\n  For the Bonaparte family in general, and Carlo and Letizia, see\r\n  _Storia genealogica della famiglia Bonaparte, della sua origine fina\r\n  all' estinzione del ramo gia esisente nella citta di S.

Joseph Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nI. JOSEPH (1768-1844), was born at Corte in Corsica, on the 7th of\r\nJanuary 1768. He was educated at the college at Autun in France,\r\nreturned to Corsica in 1784, shortly after the death of his father, and\r\nthereafter studied law at the university of Pisa. He became a barrister\r\nat Bastia in June 1788, and was soon elected a councillor of the\r\nmunicipality of Ajaccio. Like his brothers, Napoleon and Lucien, he\r\nembraced the French or democratic side, and on the victory of the\r\nPaolist party fled with his family from Corsica and sought refuge in\r\nFrance. After spending a short time in Paris, where he was disgusted\r\nwith the excesses of the Jacobins, he settled at Marseilles and married\r\nMlle Julie Clary, daughter of a merchant of that town. The Bonapartes\r\nmoved from place to place, mainly with the view of concerting measures\r\nfor the recovery of Corsica. Joseph took part in these efforts and went\r\non a mission to Genoa in 1795. In 1796 he accompanied his brother\r\nNapoleon in the early part of the Italian campaign, and had some part in\r\nthe negotiations with Sardinia which led to the armistice of Cherasco\r\n(April 28), the news of which he bore to the French government. Later he\r\nproceeded to Leghorn, took part in the French expedition for the\r\nrecovery of Corsica, and, along with the commissioner of the French\r\nRepublic, Miot de Melito, helped in the reorganization of that island.\r\nIn March 1797 he was appointed by the Directory, minister to the court\r\nof Parma, and early in the summer he proceeded to Rome in the same\r\ncapacity. Discords arose between the Vatican and the French Republic,\r\nand it is clear that Napoleon and the French Directory ordered Joseph to\r\nencourage revolutionary movements in Rome. On the 28th of December 1797\r\na disturbance took place opposite the French embassy, which led to the\r\ndeath of the French general, Leonard Duphot. Joseph at once left Rome,\r\nwhich soon became a republic. Repairing to Paris, he entered on\r\nparliamentary life, becoming one of the members for Corsica in the\r\nCouncil of Five Hundred. He made no mark in the chamber and retired in\r\n1799.\r\n\r\nBefore the _coup d'etat_ of Brumaire he helped Napoleon in making\r\novertures to Sieyes and Moreau, but otherwise did little. Thereafter he\r\nrefused to enter the ministry, but became a member of the council of\r\nstate and of the _Corps Legislatif_, where his advice on the state of\r\npublic opinion was frequently useful. He had a hand in the negotiations\r\nfor the Concordat, but, according to Lucien Bonaparte, looked on that\r\nmeasure as \"ill-advised and retrograde.\" His services in the diplomatic\r\nsphere were more important. At Mortfontaine, his country-house, he\r\nconcluded with the envoy of the United States a convention which bears\r\nthat name (1800). He also presided over the negotiations which led to\r\nthe treaty of Luneville with Austria (February 9, 1801); and he and\r\nMaret represented France in the lengthy discussions with the British\r\nenvoy, Lord Cornwallis, which resulted in the signature of the treaty of\r\nAmiens (March 25, 1802). This diplomatic triumph in its turn led to the\r\nconsolidation of Napoleon's power as First Consul for life (August 1,\r\n1802) with the chief voice in the selection of his successor. On this\r\nquestion the brothers disagreed. As neither Joseph nor Napoleon had a\r\nmale heir, the eldest brother, whose ideas of primogeniture were very\r\nstrict, claimed to be recognized as heir, while Napoleon wished to\r\nrecognize the son of Louis Bonaparte. On the proclamation of the French\r\nempire (May 1804) the friction became acute. Napoleon offered to make\r\nJoseph king of Lombardy if he would waive all claim of succession to the\r\nFrench throne, but met with a firm refusal.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Joseph had striven earnestly, but in vain, to avert a rupture\r\nwith England, which came about in May 1803. In 1805 he acted as chief of\r\nthe French government while Napoleon was campaigning in Germany. Early\r\nin 1806 he proceeded to Naples with a French force in order to expel the\r\nBourbon dynasty from southern Italy, Napoleon adding the promise that\r\nthe Neapolitan crown would be for Joseph if he chose to accept it. The\r\nconquest of the mainland was speedily effected, though Gaeta, Reggio and\r\nthe rock of Scylla held out for some months. The Bourbon court retired\r\nto Sicily, where it had the protection of a British force. By the decree\r\nof the 30th of March 1806 Napoleon proclaimed Joseph king of Naples, but\r\nallowed him to keep intact his claims to the throne of France. In\r\nseveral letters he enjoined his brother to greater firmness in his\r\nadministration: \"These peoples in Italy, and in general all nations, if\r\nthey do not find their masters, are disposed to rebellion and mutiny.\"\r\nThe memoirs of Count Miot de Melito, whom Joseph appointed minister of\r\nwar, show how great were the difficulties with which the new monarch had\r\nto contend--an almost bankrupt treasury, a fickle and degraded populace,\r\nBourbon intrigues and plots, and frequent attacks by the British from\r\nSicily. General Stuart's victory at Maida (July 3) shook Joseph's throne\r\nto its base; but the surrender of Gaeta soon enabled Massena to march\r\nsouthwards and subdue Calabria. During his brief reign at Naples, Joseph\r\neffected many improvements; he abolished the relics of feudalism,\r\nreformed the monastic orders, reorganized the judicial, financial and\r\neducational systems, and initiated several public works. In everything\r\nhe showed his desire to carry out the aims which he expressed to his\r\nconsort in April 1806: \"Justice demands that I should make this people\r\nas happy as the scourge of war will permit.\"\r\n\r\nFrom these well-meant, but not always successful, efforts he was\r\nsuddenly called away by Napoleon to take the crown of Spain (May 1808).\r\nThere his difficulties were far greater. Despite the benevolent\r\nintentions announced to the Spaniards in his proclamation dated Bayonne,\r\n23rd of June 1808, all reconciliation between them and the French was\r\nimpossible after Napoleon's treatment of their _de facto_ king,\r\nFerdinand VII. For the varying fortunes of King Joseph in Spain and in\r\nthe eventful years of the Peninsular War, see SPAIN and PENINSULAR WAR.\r\nHis sovereignty was little more than titular. Compelled to leave Madrid\r\nhastily in August 1808, owing to the Spanish success at Baylen, he was\r\nreinstated by Napoleon at the close of the year; and he was thereafter\r\nkept in a subordinate position which led him on four occasions to offer\r\nto abdicate. The emperor took no notice of these offers, and ordered him\r\nto govern with more energy. Between February and May 1810 the emperor\r\nplaced the northern and north-eastern provinces under the command of\r\nFrench generals as military districts, virtually independent of\r\nJoseph's authority. Again the king protested, but in vain. As his\r\ntrusted adviser, Miot de Melito, observed in his memoirs, Joseph tried\r\nto be constitutional king of Spain, whereas after the experience of the\r\nyears 1808-1809 he could only succeed in the Peninsula by becoming \"the\r\nmere instrument of a military power.\" \"Bearing a title which was only an\r\noppressive burden, the king had in reality ceased to exist as a monarch,\r\nand barely retained some semblance of authority over a small part of the\r\nFrench army as a general. Reduced by the exhausted state of his treasury\r\nto the last extremity he at length seriously thought of departure.\"\r\nJoseph took this step in April 1811, and proceeded to Paris in order to\r\nextort better terms, or offer his abdication; but he had to return with\r\na monthly subsidy of 500,000 francs and the promise that the army of the\r\ncentre (the smallest of the five French armies) should be under his\r\ncontrol. Late in that year Napoleon united Catalonia to France.\r\nWellington's victory at Salamanca (July 22, 1812) compelled Joseph to\r\nleave his capital; and despite the retirement of the British in the\r\nautumn of that year, Joseph's authority never fully recovered from that\r\nblow. The end of his nominal rule came in the next year, when Wellington\r\nutterly overthrew the chief French army, commanded by King Joseph and\r\nMarshal Jourdan, at Vittoria (June 21, 1813). The king fled from Spain,\r\nwas disgraced by Napoleon, and received the order to retire incognito to\r\nMortfontaine. The emperor wrote to the minister of war (July 11,\r\n1813):--\"His [Joseph's] behaviour has never ceased bringing misfortune\r\nupon my army; it is time to make an end of it.\"\r\n\r\nNapoleon was equally dissatisfied with his brother's conduct as\r\nlieutenant-general of France, while he himself was conducting the\r\ncampaign of 1814 in the east of France. On the 30th of March, Joseph\r\nempowered Marmont to make a truce with the assailants of Paris if they\r\nshould be in overpowering strength. On the surrender of the capital\r\nJoseph at once retired. The part which he played during the Hundred Days\r\n(1815) was also insignificant. It is strange that, four days after\r\nWaterloo, Napoleon should have urged him to inspirit the Chamber of\r\nDeputies with a view to a national resistance (_Lettres nouvelles de\r\nNapoleon_). In point of fact Joseph did little beyond seeking to further\r\nthe emperor's plans of escape to America. After the surrender of his\r\nbrother to the captain of H.M.S. \"Bellerophon\" at Rochefort, Joseph went\r\nto the United States. Settling in Bordentown, New Jersey, he adopted the\r\ntitle of comte de Survilliers, and sought to promote plans for the\r\nrescue of his brother from St Helena. In 1830 he pleaded, but\r\nunsuccessfully, for the recognition of the claims of the duke of\r\nReichstadt (king of Rome) to the French throne. He afterwards visited\r\nEngland, and for a time resided at Genoa and Florence. In the latter\r\ncity, the cradle of his race, he died on the 28th of July 1844. In\r\nperson he somewhat resembled Napoleon, but utterly lacked his strength\r\nand energy. He was fitted for an embassy or judgeship, but was too mild,\r\nsupine and luxurious for the tasks thrust upon him by his brother. Yet\r\nhis correspondence and memoirs prove that he retained for Napoleon warm\r\nfeelings of affection.\r\n\r\n  Of the many works dealing with Joseph Bonaparte we may cite Baron A.\r\n  du Casse, _Memoires et correspondance politique et militaire du roi\r\n  Joseph_ (10 vols., Paris, 1854), and _Les Rois freres de Napoleon_\r\n  (1883); J.S.C.

LUCIEN (1775-1840), prince of Canino, was born at Ajaccio on the\r\n21st of May 1775. He followed his elder brothers to the schools of Autun\r\nand Brienne. At that time he wished to enter the French army, but, being\r\ndebarred by defective sight, was destined for the church, and with this\r\naim in view went to the seminary at Aix in Provence (1786). His\r\nexcitable and volatile disposition agreed ill with the discipline of\r\nthe place, and on the outbreak of the Revolution in 1789 he eagerly\r\nespoused the democratic and anti-clerical movement then sweeping over\r\nFrance. On returning to Corsica he became the leading speaker in the\r\nJacobin club at Ajaccio. Pushing even Napoleon to more decided action,\r\nLucien urged his brothers to break with Paoli, the leader of the more\r\nconservative party, which sought to ally itself with England as against\r\nthe regicide republic of France. He headed a Corsican deputation which\r\nwent to France in order to denounce Paoli and to solicit aid for the\r\ndemocrats; but, on the Paolists gaining the upper hand, the Bonapartes\r\nleft the island and joined Lucien at Toulon. In the south of France he\r\nworked hard for the Jacobinical cause, and figured as \"Brutus\" in the\r\nJacobin club of the small town of St Maximin (then renamed Marathon).\r\nThere on the 4th of May 1794 he married Mlle Catherine Boyer, though he\r\nwas a minor and had not the consent of his family--an act which brought\r\nhim into a state almost approaching disgrace and penury. The _coup\r\nd'etat_ of Thermidor (July 28, 1794) compelled the young disciple of\r\nRobespierre hurriedly to leave St Maximin, and to accept a small post at\r\nSt Chamans. There he was arrested and imprisoned for a time until\r\nNapoleon's influence procured his release, and further gained for him a\r\npost as commissioner in the French army campaigning in Germany. Lucien\r\nsoon conceived a dislike for a duty which opened up no vista for his\r\npowers of oratory and political intrigue, and repaired to Corsica. In\r\nthe hope of being elected a deputy of the island, he refused an\r\nappointment offered by Napoleon in the army of Egypt in 1798. His hopes\r\nwere fulfilled, and in 1798 he entered the Council of Five Hundred at\r\nParis. There his vivacious eloquence brought him into prominence, and he\r\nwas president of that body on the eventful day of the 19th of Brumaire\r\n(November 10) 1799, when Napoleon overthrew the national councils of\r\nFrance at the palace of St Cloud. The refusal of Lucien to put the vote\r\nof outlawry, for which the majority of the council clamoured, his\r\nopportune closing of the sitting, and his appeal to the soldiers outside\r\nto disperse _les representants du poignard_, turned the scale in favour\r\nof his brother.\r\n\r\nBy a strange irony this event, the chief event of Lucien's life, was\r\nfatal to the cause of democracy of which he had been the most eager\r\nexponent. In one of his earlier letters to his brother Joseph, Lucien\r\nstated that he had detected in Napoleon \"an ambition not altogether\r\negotistic but which surpassed his love for the general weal; ... in case\r\nof a counter-revolution he would try to ride on the crest of events.\"\r\nNapoleon having by his help triumphed over parliamentary institutions in\r\nFrance, Lucien's suspicion of his brother became a dominant feeling; and\r\nthe relations between them became strained during the period of the\r\nconsulate (1799-1804). He accepted office as minister of the interior,\r\nbut was soon deprived of it owing to political and personal differences\r\nwith the First Consul. In order to soften the blow, Napoleon appointed\r\nhim ambassador to the court of Madrid (November 1800). There again\r\nLucien displeased his brother. France and Spain were then about to\r\npartition Portugal, and the Spanish forces were beginning to invade that\r\nland, when the court of Lisbon succeeded, owing (it is said) to the free\r\nuse of bribes, in inducing Godoy, the Spanish minister, and Lucien\r\nBonaparte to sign the preliminaries of peace on the 6th of June 1801 at\r\nBadajoz. The First Consul, finding his plans of seizing Lisbon\r\nfrustrated, remonstrated with his brother, who thereupon resigned his\r\npost, and returned to Paris, there taking part in the opposition which\r\nthe Tribunate offered to some of Napoleon's schemes. Lucien's next\r\nproceeding completed the breach between the two brothers. His wife had\r\ndied in 1800; he became enamoured of a Mme Jouberthou in the early\r\nsummer of 1802, made her his mistress, and finally, despite the express\r\nprohibition of the First Consul, secretly married her at his residence\r\nof Plessis (on October 23, 1803). At that time Napoleon was pressing\r\nLucien for important reasons of state to marry the widow of the king of\r\nEtruria, and on hearing of his brother's action he ordered him to leave\r\nFrench territory. Lucien departed for Italy with his wife and infant\r\nson, after annoying Napoleon by bestowing on her publicly the name of\r\nBonaparte. He also charged Joseph never to try to reconcile Napoleon to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nFor some years he lived in Italy, chiefly at Rome, showing marked\r\nhostility to the emperor. In December 1807 the latter sought to come to\r\nan arrangement by which Lucien would take his place as a French prince,\r\nprovided that he would annul his marriage. This step Lucien refused to\r\ntake; and after residing for some time at his estate of Canino, from\r\nwhich he took the papal title of prince of Canino, he left for America.\r\nCaptured by a British ship, he was taken to Malta and thence to England,\r\nwhere he resided under some measure of surveillance up to the peace of\r\n1814. Returning to Rome, he offered Napoleon his help during the Hundred\r\nDays (1815), stood by his side at the \"Champ de Mai\" at Paris, and was\r\nthe last to defend his prerogatives at the time of his second\r\nabdication. He spent the rest of his life in Italy, and died at Rome on\r\nthe 29th of June 1840. His family comprised four sons and six daughters.\r\nHe wrote an epic, _Charlemagne, ou l'Eglise delivree_ (2 vols., 1814),\r\nalso _La Verite sur les Cent Jours_ and _Memoirs_, which were not\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\n  For sources see T. Jung, _Lucien Bonaparte et ses memoires_ (3 vols.,\r\n  Paris, 1882-1883); an anonymous work, _Le Prince Lucien Bonaparte et\r\n  sa famille_ (Paris, 1888); F. Masson, _Napoleon et sa famille_ (4\r\n  vols., Paris, 1897-1900), and H. Houssaye, _\"1815\"_ (3 vols., Paris,\r\n  1899-1905).\r\n\r\n\r\n  3. Elisa.\r\n\r\nIII. MARIANNE ELISA (1777-1820) was born at Ajaccio on the 3rd of\r\nJanuary 1777. Owing to the efforts of her brothers she entered the\r\nestablishment of St Cyr near Paris as a \"king's scholar.\" On its\r\ndisruption by the revolutionists in 1792 Napoleon took charge of her and\r\nbrought her back to Ajaccio. She shared the fortunes of the family in\r\nthe south of France, and on the 5th of May 1797 married Felix Bacciochi,\r\na well-connected Corsican. In 1805, after the foundation of the French\r\nempire, Napoleon bestowed upon her the principality of Piombino and\r\nshortly afterwards Lucca; in 1808 her importunities gained for her the\r\ngrand duchy of Tuscany. Bacciochi being almost a nullity, her pride and\r\nability had a great influence on the administration and on Italian\r\naffairs in general. Her relations with Napoleon were frequently\r\nstrained; and in 1813-1814 she abetted Murat in his enterprises (see\r\nMURAT). After her brother's fall she retired, with the title of countess\r\nof Compignano, first to Bologna and afterwards to Santo Andrea near\r\nTrieste, where she died on the 6th of August 1820.\r\n\r\n  See J. Turquan, _Les Soeurs de Napoleon_ (Paris, 1896); P. Marmothan,\r\n  _Elisa Bonaparte_ (Paris, 1898); E. Rodocanachi, _Elisa Bonaparte en\r\n  Italie_ (Paris, 1900); F. Masson, _Napoleon et sa famille_ (4 vols.,\r\n  Paris, 1897-1900).\r\n\r\n\r\n  4. Louis Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nIV. Louis (1778-1846) was born at Ajaccio on the 2nd of September 1778.\r\nHis elder brother Napoleon supervised his education with much care,\r\ngaining for him scholarships to the royal military schools of France,\r\nand during the time when the elder brother was a lieutenant in garrison\r\nat Auxonne Louis shared his scanty fare. In 1795 Napoleon procured for\r\nhim admission to the military school at Chalons, and wrote thus of the\r\nboy:--\"I am very pleased with Louis; he fulfils my hopes; intelligence,\r\nwarmth, good health, talent, good address, kindness--he possesses all\r\nthese qualities.\" Louis went through the Italian campaign of 1796-97\r\nwith Napoleon and acted as his aide-de-camp in Egypt in 1798-99. In 1802\r\nthe First Consul married him to Hortense Beauharnais, a forced union\r\nwhich led to most deplorable results. In 1804 Louis was raised to the\r\nrank of general, and entered the council of state in order to perfect\r\nhis knowledge of administrative affairs. In the next year he became\r\ngovernor of Paris and undertook various military and administrative\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nAfter the victory of Austerlitz (December 2, 1805) Napoleon began to\r\nplan the formation of a ring of states surrounding, and in close\r\nalliance with, the French empire. He destined Louis for the throne of\r\nHolland, and proclaimed him king of that country on the 6th of June\r\n1806. From the first the emperor reproached him with being too easy with\r\nhis subjects and with courting popularity too much. The increasing\r\nrigour of the continental system brought the two brothers to an open\r\nrupture. Their relations were embittered by a violent jealousy which\r\nLouis conceived against his wife. In 1808 the emperor offered Louis the\r\nthrone of Spain then vacant; but on Louis refusing to accept it the\r\nhonour went to Joseph. The dispute between Louis and the emperor\r\ncontinued. In the latter part of 1809 Napoleon virtually resolved to\r\nannex Holland, in order to stop the trade which the Dutch secretly\r\ncarried on with England. At the close of the year Louis went to Paris,\r\npartly in order to procure a divorce from Hortense and partly to gain\r\nbetter terms for Holland. He failed in both respects. In January 1810\r\nNapoleon annexed the island of Walcheren, alleging that Louis had not\r\ndone his share in defending the interests of France at the time of the\r\nBritish Walcheren expedition (1809). The French troops also occupied\r\nBreda and Bergen-op-Zoom. Louis gave way on all the points in dispute;\r\nbut his acquiescence only postponed the crisis. After the collapse of\r\nnegotiations with Great Britain in the spring of 1810, the emperor again\r\npressed Louis hard, and finally sent French troops against the Dutch\r\ncapital. Thereupon Louis, despairing of offering resistance, fled from\r\nhis kingdom and finally settled at Toplitz in Bohemia. On the 9th of\r\nJuly 1810 Napoleon annexed Holland to the French empire. Louis spent the\r\nrest of his life separated from his wife, and in 1815 gained the custody\r\nof his elder son. He lived chiefly at Rome, concerning himself with\r\nliterary and philosophic studies and with the fortunes of his sons.\r\nTheir devotion to the national and democratic cause in Italy in\r\n1830-1831 gave him much pleasure, which was overclouded by the death of\r\nthe elder, Napoleon Louis, in the spring campaign of 1831 in the\r\nRomagna. The failure of his other son, Charles Louis Napoleon\r\n(afterwards Napoleon III.), to wrest the French crown from Louis\r\nPhilippe by the attempts at Strassburg and Boulogne also caused him much\r\ndisappointment. He died on the 25th of July 1846 and was buried at St\r\nLeu. Under more favourable conditions Louis would have gained a name for\r\nkindness and philanthropy, proofs of which did indeed appear during his\r\nreign in Holland and gained him the esteem of his subjects; but his\r\nmorbid sensitiveness served to embitter his relations both of a domestic\r\nand of a political nature and to sour his own disposition. His literary\r\nworks are unimportant. His sons were Napoleon Charles (1802-1807),\r\nNapoleon Louis (1804-1831), and Charles Louis Napoleon (1808-1873),\r\nafterwards emperor of the French as NAPOLEON III. (q.v.).\r\n\r\n  The chief works on the life and reign of Louis are le comte de\r\n  Saint-Leu, _Documents historiques et reflexions sur le gouvernement de\r\n  Hollande_ 3 vols., 2nd ed., Paris, 1820); F. Rocquain, _Napoleon I^er\r\n  et le Roi Louis, d'apres les documents conserves aux archives\r\n  nationales_ (Paris, 1875); Baron A. du Casse, _Les Rois freres de\r\n  Napoleon_ (Paris, 1883); A Garnier, _La Cour de Hollande sous le regne\r\n  de Louis Bonaparte, par un auditeur_ (Paris and Amsterdam, 1823); T.\r\n  Jorissen, _Napoleon 1'er et le roi de Hollande (1806-1813) d'apres des\r\n  documents authentiques et inedits_ (Paris and The Hague, 1868); V.\r\n  Loosjes, _Louis Bonaparte, Koning van Holland_ (Amsterdam, 1888); L.\r\n  Wichers, _De Regeering van Koning Lodewijk Napoleon_ (1806-1810)\r\n  (Utrecht, 1892); F. Masson, _Napoleon et sa famille_ (4 vols., Paris,\r\n  1897-1900).\r\n\r\n\r\n  5. Pauline.\r\n\r\nV. MARIE PAULINE (1780-1825), the gayest and most beautiful member of\r\nthe family, was born at Ajaccio on the 20th October 1780. At seventeen\r\nyears of age she married General Leclerc, a staff officer of Napoleon,\r\nand accompanied him to St Domingo, where he died of yellow fever in\r\n1802. Returning to Paris she espoused Prince Camillo Borghese (August\r\n23, 1803) and went to reside with him in Rome. She soon tired of him,\r\nreturned to Paris and gratified her whims in ways that caused some\r\nscandal. In 1806 she received the title of duchess of Guastalla. Her\r\noffhand treatment of the new empress, Marie Louise, in 1810 led to her\r\nremoval from court. Nevertheless in 1814 she repaired with \"Madame Mere\"\r\nto Elba, and is said to have expressed a wish to share Napoleon's exile\r\nin St Helena. She died in 1825 of cancer. Canova's statue of her as\r\nVenus reclining on a couch is well known.\r\n\r\n  See J. Turquan, _Les Soeurs de Napoleon: les princesses Elisa, Pauline\r\n  et Caroline_ (Paris, 1896); F. Masson, _Napoleon et sa famille_ (4\r\n  vols., Paris, 1897-1900).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  6. Caroline Murat.\r\n\r\nVI. MARIA ANNUNCIATA CAROLINE (1782-1839) was born at Ajaccio on the\r\n25th of March 1782. Early in 1800 she married Joachim Murat, whose\r\ninterests she afterwards advanced with all the power of her ambitious\r\nand intriguing nature. He became governor of Paris, marshal of France\r\n(1804), grand duke of Berg and of Cleves (1806), lieutenant of the\r\nemperor in Spain (1808), and early in the summer of that year king of\r\nNaples. The distance of this capital from Paris displeased Caroline; her\r\nrelations with Napoleon became strained, and she associated herself with\r\nthe equivocal movements of her husband in 1814-1815. Before his tragic\r\nend at Pizzo on the 13th of October 1815, she had retired to Austrian\r\nterritory and was placed under some measure of restraint. Finally she\r\nlived at Trieste with her sister Elisa. She died on the 18th of May\r\n1839.\r\n\r\n  See J. Turquan, _Caroline Murat, reine de Naples_ (Paris, 1899); F.\r\n  Masson, _Napoleon et sa famille_ (4 vols., Paris, 1897-1900). See also\r\n  under MURAT, JOACHIM.\r\n\r\n\r\n  7. Jerome Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nVII. JEROME (1784-1860) was born at Ajaccio on the 15th of November\r\n1784; he shared the fortunes of the family in the early years of the\r\nFrench Revolution, was then educated at Juilly and was called to the\r\nside of his brother, then First Consul of France, in 1800. Many stories\r\nare told illustrating his impetuous but affectionate nature. While in\r\nthe Consular Guard he fought a duel with the younger brother of General\r\nDavout and was wounded. Soon afterwards he was transferred to the navy\r\nand cruised in the West Indies, until, when blockaded by a British\r\ncruiser, he left his ship and travelled through the United States. At\r\nBaltimore he fell in love with Miss Elizabeth Patterson, and, though a\r\nminor, married her. This disregard of discipline and of the laws of\r\nFrance greatly annoyed Napoleon; and when in 1805 Jerome brought his\r\nwife to Europe, the emperor ordered her to be excluded from his states.\r\nJerome vainly sought to bend his brother's will in an interview at\r\nAlexandria. In May 1805 he received command of a small squadron in the\r\nMediterranean, while his wife proceeded to Camberwell, where she gave\r\nbirth to a son. In November Jerome sailed in a squadron commanded by\r\nAdmiral Willaumez, which was to ravage the West Indies; but it was\r\nscattered by a storm. After damaging British commerce in the North\r\nAtlantic, Jerome reached France with his ship in safety in August 1806.\r\nNapoleon made him a prince of France, and gave him command of a division\r\nof South Germans in the campaign of 1806. After Jena, Jerome received\r\nthe surrender of several Prussian towns. An imperial decree having\r\nannulled the Patterson marriage, the emperor united Jerome to the\r\nprincess Catherine of Wurttemberg; and in pursuance of the terms of the\r\ntreaty of Tilsit (July 7, 1807) raised him to the throne of the new\r\nkingdom of Westphalia. There Jerome, though frequently rebuked by the\r\nemperor, displayed his fondness for luxury, indulged in numerous\r\n_amours_ and ran deeply into debt. In some respects his kingdom\r\nbenefited by the connexion with France. Feudalism was abolished; the\r\n_Code Napoleon_ was introduced; the Jews were freed from repressive\r\nlaws; and education received some impulse in its higher departments. But\r\nthe unpopularity of Jerome's rule was shown by the part taken by the\r\npeasants in the abortive rising headed by Baron Wilhelm von Dornberg and\r\nother Westphalian officers in April 1809. Despite heavy taxation, the\r\nstate debt increased greatly; and the sending of a contingent to Russia\r\nin 1812 brought the state to the verge of bankruptcy. In the early part\r\nof that campaign Jerome was entrusted with an important movement which\r\nmight have brought the southern Russian army into grave danger; on his\r\nfailure (which was probably due to his lack of energy) the emperor\r\npromptly subjected him to the control of Marshal Davout, and Jerome\r\nreturned to Cassel. In 1813, on the fall of the Napoleonic regime in\r\nGermany, Jerome retired to France, and in 1814 spent some time in\r\nSwitzerland and at Trieste. Returning to France in 1815, he commanded a\r\ndivision on the French left wing at Waterloo and attacked Hougomont with\r\ngreat pertinacity. On Napoleon's second abdication Jerome proceeded to\r\nWurttemberg, was threatened with arrest unless he gave up his wife and\r\nchild, and was kept under surveillance at Goppingen; finally he was\r\nallowed to proceed to Augsburg, and thereafter resided at Trieste, or in\r\nItaly or Switzerland. His consort died in 1835. He returned to France in\r\n1847, and after the rise of Louis Napoleon to power, became successively\r\ngovernor of the Invalides, marshal of France and president of the\r\nsenate. He died on the 24th of June 1860. His children were Jerome\r\nNapoleon (see XIV.), Mathilde (see XII.) and Napoleon Joseph Charles\r\nPaul (born in 1822); the last was afterwards known as Prince Napoleon\r\n(see XI. below) and finally became the heir to the fortunes of the\r\nNapoleonic dynasty.\r\n\r\n  The chief works relating to Jerome Bonaparte are: Baron Albert du\r\n  Casse, _Memoires et correspondance du roi Jerome et de la reine\r\n  Catherine_ (7 vols., Paris, 1861-1866) and _Les Rois freres de\r\n  Napoleon_ (1883); M.M. Kaisenberg, _Konig Jerome Napoleon_; W.T.R.\r\n  Saffell, _The Bonaparte-Patterson Marriage_; August von Schlossberger,\r\n  _Briefwechsel der Konigin Katharina und des Konigs Jerome von\r\n  Westfalen mit Konig Friedrich von Wurttemberg_ (Stuttgart, 1886-1887),\r\n  supplemented by du Casse in _Corresp. inedite de la reine Catherine de\r\n  Westphalie_ (Paris, 1888-1893); A. Martinet, _Jerome Napoleon, roi de\r\n  Westfalie_ (Paris, 1902); P.W. Sergeant, _The Burlesque Napoleon_\r\n  (1905); F. Masson, _Napoleon et sa famille_ (4 vols., Paris,\r\n  1897-1900).     (J. Hl. R.)\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of the Bonaparte family may be further followed under the\r\nlater biographies of its leading members, mainly descendants of Lucien\r\n(II. above) and Jerome (VII. above).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Descendants of Lucien: 8. Charles.\r\n\r\nVIII. CHARLES LUCIEN JULES LAURENT (1803-1857), prince of Canino, son of\r\nLucien Bonaparte, was a scientist rather than a politician. He married\r\nhis cousin, Zenaide Bonaparte, daughter of Joseph, in 1822. At the age\r\nof twenty-two he began the publication of an _American Ornithology_ (4\r\nvols., Philadelphia, 1825-1833), which established his scientific\r\nreputation. A series of other works in zoology followed: _Iconographia\r\ndella fauna Italica_ (3 vols., Rome, 1832-1841), _Catalogo metodico\r\ndegli uccelli europei_ (1 vol., Bologna, 1842), _Catalogo metodico dei\r\npesci europei_ (1 vol., Naples, 1845, 4to), _Catalogo metodico dei\r\nmammiferi europei_ (1 vol., Milan, 1845), _Telachorum tabula analytica_\r\n(Neufchatel, 1838). He was elected honorary member of the academy of\r\nUpsala in 1833, of that of Berlin in 1843, and correspondent of the\r\nInstitute of France in 1844. Towards 1847 he took part in the political\r\nagitation in Italy, and presided over scientific congresses, notably at\r\nVenice, where he declared himself in favour of the independence of Italy\r\nand the expulsion of the Austrians. He entered the Junto of Rome in 1848\r\nand was elected deputy by Viterbo to the national assembly. The failure\r\nof the revolution forced him to leave Italy in July 1849. He gained\r\nHolland, then France, where he turned again to science. His principal\r\nworks were, _Conspectus systematis ornithologiae, mastozologiae,\r\nerpetologiae et amphibologiae, Ichthyologiae_ (Leiden, 1850), _Tableau\r\ndes oiseaux-mouches_ (Paris, 1854), _Ornithologie fossile_ (Paris,\r\n1858). Eight children survived him: Joseph Lucien Charles Napoleon,\r\nprince of Canino (1824-1865), who died without heirs; Lucien Louis\r\nJoseph Napoleon, born in 1828, who took holy orders in 1853 and became a\r\ncardinal in 1868; Julie Charlotte Zenaide Pauline Laetitia Desiree\r\nBartholomee, who married the marquis of Roccagiovine; Charlotte Honorine\r\nJosephine, who married Count Primoli; Marie Desiree Eugenie Josephine\r\nPhilomene, who married the count Campello; Auguste Amelie Maximilienne\r\nJacqueline, who married Count Gabrielli; Napoleon Charles Gregoire\r\nJacques Philippe, born in 1839, who married the princess Ruspoli, by\r\nwhom he had two daughters; and Bathilde Aloyse Leonie, who married the\r\ncomte de Cambaceres. The branch is now extinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n  9. Louis Lucien.\r\n\r\nIX. LOUIS LUCIEN (1813-1891), son of Lucien Bonaparte, was born at\r\nThorngrove, Worcestershire, England, on the 4th of January 1813. He\r\npassed his youth in England, not going to France until 1848, when, after\r\nthe revolution, he was elected deputy for Corsica on the 28th of\r\nNovember 1848; his election having been invalidated, he was returned as\r\ndeputy for the Seine in June 1849. He sat in the right of the\r\nLegislative Assembly, but had no direct part in the _coup d'etat_ of his\r\ncousin on the 2nd of December 1851. Napoleon III. named him senator and\r\nprince, but he took hardly any part in politics during the Second\r\nEmpire, and after the proclamation of the Third Republic in 1870 he\r\nwithdrew to England. There he busied himself with philology, and\r\npublished notably some works on the Basque language: _Grammaire basque,\r\nRemarques sur plusieurs assertions concernant la langue basque_ (1876),\r\n_Observations sur le basque Fontarabie_ (1878). He died on the 3rd of\r\nNovember 1891, leaving no children.\r\n\r\n\r\n  10. Pierre.\r\n\r\nX. PIERRE NAPOLEON (1815-1881), son of Lucien Bonaparte, was born at\r\nRome on the 12th of September 1815. He began his life of adventure at\r\nthe age of fifteen, joining the insurrectionary bands in the Romagna\r\n(1830-1831); was then in the United States, where he went to join his\r\nuncle Joseph, and in Colombia with General Santander (1832). Returning\r\nto Rome he was taken prisoner by order of the pope (1835-1836). He\r\nfinally took refuge in England. At the revolution of 1848 he returned to\r\nFrance and was elected deputy for Corsica to the Constituent Assembly.\r\nHe declared himself an out-and-out republican and voted even with the\r\nsocialists. He pronounced himself in favour of the national workshops\r\nand against the _loi Falloux_. His attitude contributed greatly to give\r\npopular confidence to his cousin Louis Napoleon (Napoleon III.), of\r\nwhose _coup d'etat_ on the 2nd of December 1851 he disapproved; but he\r\nwas soon reconciled to the emperor, and accepted the title of prince.\r\nThe republicans at once abandoned him. From that time on he led a\r\ndebauched life, and lost all political importance. He turned to\r\nliterature and published some mediocre poems. In January 1870 a violent\r\nincident brought him again into prominence. As the result of a\r\ncontroversy with Paschal Grousset, the latter sent him two journalists\r\nto provoke him to a duel. Pierre Bonaparte took them personally to\r\naccount, and during a violent discussion he drew his revolver and killed\r\none of them, Victor Noir. This crime greatly excited the republican\r\npress, which demanded his trial. The High Court acquitted him, and\r\ncriticism then fell upon the government. Pierre Bonaparte died in\r\nobscurity at Versailles on the 7th of April 1881. He had married the\r\ndaughter of a Paris working-man, Justine Eleanore Ruffin, by whom he\r\nhad, before his marriage, two children: (1) Roland Napoleon, born on the\r\n19th of May 1858, who entered the army, was excluded from it in 1886,\r\nand then devoted himself to geography and scientific explorations; (2)\r\nJeanne, wife of the marquis de Vence.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Descendants of Jerome: 11. Prince Napoleon (Plon-Plon).\r\n\r\nXI. NAPOLEON JOSEPH CHARLES PAUL, commonly known as Prince Napoleon, or\r\nby the sobriquet of \"Plon-Plon,\"[1] (1822-1891), was the second son of\r\nJerome Bonaparte, king of Westphalia, by his wife Catherine, princess of\r\nWurttemberg, and was born at Trieste on the 9th of September 1822. He\r\nsoon rendered himself popular by his advanced democratic ideas, which he\r\nexpressed on all possible occasions. After the French revolution of 1848\r\nhe was elected to the National Assembly as a representative of Corsica,\r\nand (his elder brother, Jerome Napoleon Charles, dying in 1847) assumed\r\nthe name of Jerome. Notwithstanding his ostensible opposition to the\r\n_coup d'etat_ of 1851, he was designated, upon the establishment of the\r\nEmpire, as successor to the throne if Napoleon III. should die\r\nchildless, and received a liberal dotation, but was allowed no share in\r\npublic affairs. Privately he professed himself the representative of the\r\nNapoleonic tradition in its democratic aspect, and associated mainly\r\nwith men of advanced political opinions. At court he represented the\r\nLiberal party against the empress Eugenie. In 1854 he took part in the\r\nCrimean campaign as general of division. His conduct at the battle of\r\nthe Alma occasioned imputations upon his personal courage, but they seem\r\nto have been entirely groundless. Returning to France he undertook the\r\nchief direction of the National Exhibition of 1855, in which he\r\nmanifested great capacity. In 1858 he was appointed minister for the\r\nColonies and Algeria, and his administration aroused great hopes, but\r\nhis activity was diverted into a different channel by his sudden\r\nmarriage in January 1859 with the princess Marie Clotilde of Savoy,\r\ndaughter of Victor Emmanuel, a prelude to the war for the liberation of\r\nItaly. In this war Prince Napoleon commanded the French corps that\r\noccupied Tuscany, and it was expected that he would become ruler of the\r\nprincipality, but he refused to exert any pressure upon the inhabitants,\r\nwho preferred union with the Italian kingdom. The next few years were\r\nchiefly distinguished by remarkable speeches which displayed the prince\r\nin the unexpected character of a great orator. Unfortunately his\r\nindiscretion equalled his eloquence: one speech (1861) sent him to\r\nAmerica to avoid a duel with the duke d'Aumale; another (1865), in which\r\nhe justly but intemperately protested against the Mexican expedition,\r\ncost him all his official dignities. Nevertheless he was influential in\r\neffecting the reform by which in 1869 it was sought to reconcile the\r\nEmpire with Liberal principles. The fatal war of 1870 was resolved upon\r\nduring his absence in Norway, and was strongly condemned by him. After\r\nthe first disasters he undertook an ineffectual mission to Italy to\r\nimplore the aid of his father-in-law; and after the fall of the Empire\r\nlived in comparative retirement until in 1879 the death of Napoleon\r\nIII.'s son, the Prince Imperial (see XIII. below), made him direct heir\r\nto the Napoleonic succession. His part as imperial pretender was\r\nunfortunate and inglorious: his democratic opinions were unacceptable to\r\nthe imperial party, and before his death he was virtually deposed in\r\nfavour of his son Prince Napoleon Victor, who, supported by Paul de\r\nCassagnac and others, openly declared himself a candidate for the throne\r\nin 1884. He died at Rome on the 17th of March 1891. In the character of\r\nhis intellect, as in personal appearance, he bore an extraordinary\r\nresemblance to the first Napoleon, possessing the same marvellous\r\nlucidity of insight, and the same gift of infallibly distinguishing the\r\nessential from the non-essential. He was a warm friend of literature and\r\nart, and in a private station would have achieved high distinction as a\r\nman of letters.\r\n\r\nHis eldest son, Prince Napoleon Victor Jerome Frederic (b. 1862), became\r\nat his death the recognized head of the French Bonapartist party. The\r\nsecond son, Prince Louis Napoleon, an officer in the Russian army,\r\nshowed a steadier disposition, and was more favoured in some monarchist\r\nquarters; in 1906 he was made governor of the Caucasus.\r\n\r\n\r\n  12. Mathilde.\r\n\r\nXII. MATHILDE LETITIA WILHELMINE (1820-1904), daughter of Jerome, and\r\nsister of Prince Napoleon (XI.), was born at Trieste on the 20th of May\r\n1820; after being almost betrothed to her cousin Louis Napoleon, in 1840\r\nshe was married to Prince Anatole Demidov. His conduct, however, led to\r\na separation within five years, and the tsar Nicholas compelled him to\r\nmake Princess Mathilde a handsome allowance. After the election of Louis\r\nNapoleon to the presidency of the republic she took up her residence in\r\nParis, and did the honours of the Elysee till his marriage. She\r\ncontinued to live in Paris, having great influence as a friend and\r\npatron of men of art and letters, till her death on the 2nd of January\r\n1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n  13. Prince Imperial: son of Napoleon III.\r\n\r\nXIII. NAPOLEON EUGENE LOUIS JEAN JOSEPH (1856-1879), Prince Imperial,\r\nonly son of the emperor Napoleon III. and the empress Eugenie, was born\r\nat Paris on the 16th of March 1856. He was a delicate boy, but when the\r\nwar of 1870 broke out his mother sent him to the army, to win popularity\r\nfor him, and the government journals vaunted his bravery. After the\r\nfirst defeats he had to flee from France with the empress, and settled\r\nin England at Chislehurst, completing his military education at\r\nWoolwich. On the death of his father on the 9th of January 1873 the\r\nImperialists proclaimed him Napoleon IV., and he became the official\r\nPretender. He was naturally inactive, but he was influenced by his\r\nmother on the one hand, and by the Bonapartist leaders in France on the\r\nother. They thought that he should win his crown by military prestige,\r\nand he was persuaded to attach himself as a volunteer to the English\r\nexpedition to Zululand in February 1879. It was a blunder to have\r\nallowed him to go, and the blunder ended in a tragedy, for while out on\r\na reconnaissance with a few troopers they were surprised by Zulus, and\r\nthe Prince Imperial was killed (June 1, 1879). His body was brought back\r\nto England, and buried at Chislehurst.\r\n\r\nXIV. THE BONAPARTES OF BALTIMORE are a branch of the family settled in\r\nAmerica, descended from Jerome Bonaparte (VII.) by his union with\r\nElizabeth (b. 1785), daughter of William Patterson, a Baltimore\r\nmerchant, probably descended from the Robert Paterson who was the\r\noriginal of Sir Walter Scott's \"Old Mortality.\" The marriage took place\r\nat Baltimore on the 24th of December 1803, but it was greatly disliked\r\nby Napoleon, who refused to recognize its legality. However, it was\r\nvalid according to American law, and Pope Pius VII. refused to declare\r\nit void. Nevertheless Jerome was forced by his brother to separate\r\nhimself from his wife, whom he had brought to Europe, and after a stay\r\nin England Madame Patterson, or Madame Bonaparte, as she was usually\r\ncalled, returned to Baltimore. She died in 1879. Jerome's only child by\r\nthis marriage was Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte (1805-1870), who was born in\r\nEngland, but resided chiefly in Baltimore, and is said to have shown a\r\nmarked resemblance to his uncle, the great emperor. He was on good terms\r\nwith Jerome, who for some time made him a large allowance, and father\r\nand son occasionally met. His elder son, also called Jerome Napoleon\r\nBonaparte (1832-1893), entered the French army, with which he served in\r\nthe Crimea and in Italy.\r\n\r\nCharles Joseph Bonaparte (b. 1851), younger son of the first Jerome\r\nNapoleon Bonaparte, and a grandson of Jerome, king of Westphalia,\r\nattained a distinguished place in American politics. Born at Baltimore\r\non the 9th of June 1851 and educated at Harvard University, he became a\r\nlawyer in 1874 and has been president of the National Municipal League\r\nand has filled other public positions. He was secretary of the navy in\r\nPresident Roosevelt's cabinet from July 1905 to December 1906, and then\r\nattorney-general of the United States until March 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] Derived, it is supposed, from the nickname \"Plomb-plomb,\" or\r\n    \"Craint-plomb\" (fear-lead), given him by his soldiers in the Crimea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONAR, HORATIUS (1808-1889), Scottish Presbyterian divine, was born in\r\nEdinburgh on the 19th of December 1808, and educated at the high school\r\nand university of his native city. After a term of mission work at\r\nLeith, he was appointed parish minister of Kelso in 1837, and at the\r\nDisruption of 1843 became minister of the newly formed Free Church,\r\nwhere he remained till 1866, when he went to the Chalmers memorial\r\nchurch, Edinburgh. He had in 1853 received the D.D. degree from Aberdeen\r\nUniversity, and in 1883 he was moderator of the general assembly of his\r\nchurch. He died on the 31st of July 1889. Bonar was a prolific writer of\r\nreligious literature, and edited several journals, including the\r\n_Christian Treasury_, the _Presbyterian Review_ and the _Quarterly\r\nJournal of Prophecy_; but his best work was done in hymnology, and he\r\npublished three series of _Hymns of Faith and Hope_ between 1857 and\r\n1866 (new ed., 1886). Nearly every modern hymnal contains perhaps a\r\nscore of his hymns, including \"Go, labour on,\" \"I heard the voice of\r\nJesus say,\" \"Here, O my Lord, I see Thee face to face,\" \"When the weary,\r\nseeking rest.\"\r\n\r\n  See _Horatius Bonar, D.D., a Memorial_ (1889).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONAVENTURA, SAINT (JOHN OF FIDANZA), Franciscan theologian, was born in\r\n1221 at Bagnarea in Tuscany. He was destined by his mother for the\r\nchurch, and is said to have received his cognomen of Bonaventura from St\r\nFrancis of Assisi, who performed on him a miraculous cure. He entered\r\nthe Franciscan order in 1243, and studied at Paris possibly under\r\nAlexander of Hales, and certainly under Alexander's successor, John of\r\nRochelle, to whose chair he succeeded in 1253. Three years earlier his\r\nfame had gained for him permission to read upon the _Sentences_, and in\r\n1255 he received the degree of doctor. So high was his reputation that\r\nin the following year he was elected general of his order. It was by his\r\norders that Roger Bacon was interdicted from lecturing at Oxford, and\r\ncompelled to put himself under the surveillance of the order at Paris.\r\nHe was instrumental in procuring the election of Gregory X., who\r\nrewarded him with the titles of cardinal and bishop of Albano, and\r\ninsisted on his presence at the great council of Lyons in the year 1274.\r\nAt this meeting he died.\r\n\r\nBonaventura's character seems not unworthy of the eulogistic title,\r\n\"Doctor Seraphicus,\" bestowed on him by his contemporaries, and of the\r\nplace assigned to him by Dante in his _Paradiso_. He was formally\r\ncanonized in 1482 by Sixtus IV., and ranked as sixth among the great\r\ndoctors of the church by Sixtus V. in 1587. His works, as arranged in\r\nthe Lyons edition (7 vols., folio), consist of expositions and sermons,\r\nfilling the first three volumes; of a commentary on the _Sentences_ of\r\nLombardus, in two volumes, celebrated among medieval theologians as\r\nincomparably the best exposition of the third part; and of minor\r\ntreatises filling the remaining two volumes, and including a life of St\r\nFrancis. The smaller works are the most important, and of them the best\r\nare the famous _Itinerarium Mentis ad Deum, Breviloquium, De Reductione\r\nArtium ad Theologiam, Soliloquium_, and _De septem itineribus\r\naeternitatis_, in which most of what is individual in his teaching is\r\ncontained.\r\n\r\nIn philosophy Bonaventura presents a marked contrast to his great\r\ncontemporaries, Thomas Aquinas and Roger Bacon. While these may be taken\r\nas representing respectively physical science yet in its infancy, and\r\nAristotelian scholasticism in its most perfect form, he brings before us\r\nthe mystical and Platonizing mode of speculation which had already to\r\nsome extent found expression in Hugo and Richard of St Victor, and in\r\nBernard of Clairvaux. To him the purely intellectual element, though\r\nnever absent, is of inferior interest when compared with the living\r\npower of the affections or the heart. He rejects the authority of\r\nAristotle, to whose influence he ascribes much of the heretical tendency\r\nof the age, and some of whose cardinal doctrines--such as the eternity\r\nof the world--he combats vigorously. But the Platonism he received was\r\nPlato as understood by St Augustine, and as he had been handed down by\r\nthe Alexandrian school and the author of the mystical works passing\r\nunder the name of Dionysius the Areopagite. Bonaventura accepts as\r\nPlatonic the theory that ideas do not exist _in rerum natura_, but as\r\nthoughts of the divine mind, according to which actual things were\r\nformed; and this conception has no slight influence upon his philosophy.\r\nLike all the great scholastic doctors he starts with the discussion of\r\nthe relations between reason and faith. All the sciences are but the\r\nhandmaids of theology; reason can discover some of the moral truths\r\nwhich form the groundwork of the Christian system, but others it can\r\nonly receive and apprehend through divine illumination. In order to\r\nobtain this illumination the soul must employ the proper means, which\r\nare prayer, the exercise of the virtues, whereby it is rendered fit to\r\naccept the divine light, and meditation which may rise even to ecstatic\r\nunion with God. The supreme end of life is such union, union in\r\ncontemplation or intellect and in intense absorbing love; but it cannot\r\nbe entirely reached in this life, and remains as a hope for futurity.\r\nThe mind in contemplating God has three distinct aspects, stages or\r\ngrades--the senses, giving empirical knowledge of what is without and\r\ndiscerning the traces (_vestigia_) of the divine in the world; the\r\nreason, which examines the soul itself, the image of the divine Being;\r\nand lastly, pure intellect (_intelligentia_), which, in a transcendent\r\nact, grasps the Being of the divine cause. To these three correspond the\r\nthree kinds of theology--_theologia symbolica, theologia propria_ and\r\n_theologia mystica_. Each stage is subdivided, for in contemplating the\r\nouter world we may use the senses or the imagination; we may rise to a\r\nknowledge of God _per vestigia_ or _in vestigiis_. In the first case the\r\nthree great properties of physical bodies--weight, number, measure,--in\r\nthe second the division of created things into the classes of those that\r\nhave merely physical existence, those that have life, and those that\r\nhave thought, irresistibly lead us to conclude the power, wisdom and\r\ngoodness of the Triune God. So in the second stage we may ascend to the\r\nknowledge of God, _per imaginem_, by reason, or _in imagine_, by the\r\npure understanding (_intellectus_); in the one case the triple\r\ndivision--memory, understanding and will,--in the other the Christian\r\nvirtues--faith, hope and charity,--leading again to the conception of a\r\nTrinity of divine qualities--eternity, truth and goodness. In the last\r\nstage we have first _intelligentia_, pure intellect, contemplating the\r\nessential being of God, and finding itself compelled by necessity of\r\nthought to hold absolute being as the first notion, for non-being\r\ncannot be conceived apart from being, of which it is but the privation.\r\nTo this notion of absolute being, which is perfect and the greatest of\r\nall, objective existence must be ascribed. In its last and highest form\r\nof activity the mind rests in the contemplation of the infinite goodness\r\nof God, which is apprehended by means of the highest faculty, the _apex\r\nmentis_ or _synderesis_. This spark of the divine illumination is common\r\nto all forms of mysticism, but Bonaventura adds to it peculiarly\r\nChristian elements. The complete yielding up of mind and heart to God is\r\nunattainable without divine grace, and nothing renders us so fit to\r\nreceive this gift as the meditative and ascetic life of the cloister.\r\nThe monastic life is the best means of grace.\r\n\r\nBonaventura, however, is not merely a meditative thinker, whose works\r\nmay form good manuals of devotion; he is a dogmatic theologian of high\r\nrank, and on all the disputed questions of scholastic thought, such as\r\nuniversals, matter, the principle of individualism, or the _intellectus\r\nagens_, he gives weighty and well-reasoned decisions. He agrees with\r\nAlbertus Magnus in regarding theology as a practical science; its\r\ntruths, according to his view, are peculiarly adapted to influence the\r\naffections. He discusses very carefully the nature and meaning of the\r\ndivine attributes; considers universals to be the ideal forms\r\npre-existing in the divine mind according to which things were shaped;\r\nholds matter to be pure potentiality which receives individual being and\r\ndeterminateness from the formative power of God, acting according to the\r\nideas; and finally maintains that the _intellectus agens_ has no\r\nseparate existence. On these and on many other points of scholastic\r\nphilosophy the Seraphic Doctor exhibits a combination of subtilty and\r\nmoderation which makes his works peculiarly valuable.\r\n\r\n  EDITIONS.--7 vols., Rome, 1588-1596; 7 vols., Lyons, 1668; 13 vols.,\r\n  Venice, 1751 ff.; by A.C.

Ad.; X.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONCHAMPS, CHARLES MELCHIOR ARTUS, MARQUIS DE (c. 1760-1793), Vendean\r\nleader, was born at Jouverteil, Anjou. He gained his first military\r\nexperience in the American War of Independence, and on his return to\r\nFrance was made a captain of grenadiers in the French army. He was a\r\nstaunch upholder of the monarchy, and at the outbreak of the French\r\nRevolution resigned his command and retired to his chateau at St\r\nFlorent. In the spring of 1793 he was chosen leader by the insurgents of\r\nthe Vendee, and to his counsels may be attributed in great measure the\r\nsuccess of the peasants' arms. He was present at the taking of\r\nBressuire, Thouars and Fontenay, at which last place he was wounded; but\r\ndissensions among their leaders weakened the insurgents, and at the\r\nbloody battle of Cholet (October 1793) the Vendeans sustained a severe\r\ndefeat and Bonchamps was mortally wounded. He died the next day. It is\r\nsaid that his last act was the pardoning of five thousand republican\r\nprisoners, whom his troops had sworn to kill in revenge for his death. A\r\nstatue of him by David d'Angers stands in the church of St Florent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOND, SIR EDWARD AUGUSTUS (1815-1898), English librarian, was born at\r\nHanwell on the 31st of December 1815, the son of a schoolmaster. He was\r\neducated at Merchant Taylors' school, and in 1832 obtained a post in the\r\npublic record office. In 1838 he became an assistant in the manuscript\r\ndepartment of the British Museum, where he attracted the notice of his\r\nchief, Sir Frederick Madden, the most eminent palaeographer of his day,\r\nand in 1852 he was made Egerton librarian. In 1856 he became assistant\r\nkeeper of MSS., and in 1867 was promoted to the post of keeper. His work\r\nin reorganizing the manuscript department was of lasting value, and to\r\nhim is due the classified catalogue of MSS., and the improved efficiency\r\nand punctuality of publication of the department. In 1878 he was\r\nappointed principal librarian. Under his supervision were erected the\r\nnew buildings of the \"White Wing,\" which provide accommodation for\r\nprints, drawings, manuscripts and newspapers, and the purchase of the\r\nStowe MSS. was concluded while he remained in office. He founded, in\r\nconjunction with Sir E. Maunde Thompson, the Palaeographical Society,\r\nand first made classical palaeography an exact science. He was made\r\nLL.D. of Cambridge in 1879, created C.B. in 1885, and K.C.B. the day\r\nbefore his death on the 2nd of January 1898. He was the editor of four\r\nvolumes of facsimiles of Anglo-Saxon charters from 679 to the Conquest,\r\n_The Speeches in the Trial of Warren Hastings_ (1859-1861), and a number\r\nof other interesting historic documents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOND,[1] in English law, an obligation by deed. Its design is to secure\r\nthat the obligor, i.e. the person giving the bond, will either pay a\r\nsum of money, or do or refrain from doing some act; and for this purpose\r\nthe obligor binds himself in a penalty to the obligee, with a condition\r\nadded that, if the obligor pays the sum secured--which is usually half\r\nthe penalty--or does or refrains from doing the specified act, the bond\r\nshall be void: otherwise it shall remain in full force. This condition\r\nis known as the defeasance because it defeats or undoes the bond. The\r\nform of a common money bond runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Know All Men by these presents that I, A.B. (name, address and\r\n  description of obligor), am bound to C.D. (name, address and\r\n  description of obligee) in the sum of L[2000] to be paid to the said\r\n  (obligee), his executors, administrators or assigns or to his or their\r\n  attorney or attorneys, for which payment I bind myself by these\r\n  presents. Sealed with my seal. Dated this      day of 19   .\r\n\r\n  The condition of the above-written bond is such that if the above\r\n  A.B., his heirs, executors or administrators, shall on the       day\r\n  of pay to the above-named C.D., his heirs, executors, administrators\r\n  or assigns the sum of L[1000], with interest for the same from the\r\n  date of the above-written bond at the rate of        per cent per\r\n  annum without any deduction, then the above-written bond shall be\r\n  void: otherwise the bond shall remain in full force.\r\n\r\n  Signed, sealed and delivered\r\n    by the above-named A.B.\r\n    in the presence of (witness)\r\n\r\nRecitals are frequently added to explain the circumstances under which\r\nthe bond is given.\r\n\r\nIf the condition is not performed, i.e. if the obligor does not pay the\r\nmoney by the day stipulated, or do or refrain from doing the act\r\nprovided for, the bond becomes forfeit or absolute at law, and charges\r\nthe obligor and his estate (see Conveyancing Act 1881, s. 59). In old\r\ndays, when a bond was forfeit, the whole penalty was recoverable at law\r\nand payment _post diem_ could not be pleaded to an action on it, but the\r\ncourt of chancery early interposed to prevent oppression. It held the\r\npenalty of a bond to be the form, not the substance of it, a pledge\r\nmerely to secure repayment of the sum bona fide advanced, and would not\r\npermit a man to take more than in conscience he ought, i.e. in case of a\r\ncommon money bond, his principal, interest and expenses. This equitable\r\nrelief received statutory recognition by an act of 1705, which provided\r\nthat, in case of a common money bond, payment of the lesser sum with\r\ninterest and costs shall be taken in full satisfaction of the bond. An\r\nobligee of a common money bond can, since the date of the Judicature\r\nAct, obtain summary judgment under O. xiv. (R.S.C. 1883) by specially\r\nendorsing his writ under O. iii. R. 6.\r\n\r\nBonds were, however, and still are given to secure performance of a\r\nvariety of matters other than the payment of a sum of money at a fixed\r\ndate. They may be given and are given, for instance, to guarantee the\r\nfidelity of a clerk, of a rent collector, or of a person in an office of\r\npublic trust, or to secure that an intended husband will settle a sum on\r\nhis wife in the event of her surviving him, or that a building contract\r\nshall be carried out, or that a rival business shall not be carried on\r\nby the obligor except within certain limits of time and space. The same\r\nobject can often be attained--and more conveniently attained--by a\r\ncovenant than by bond, and covenants have in the practice of\r\nconveyancers largely superseded bonds, but there are cases where\r\nsecurity by bond is still preferable to security by covenant. Thus under\r\na bond to secure an annuity, if the obligor makes default, judgment may\r\nbe entered for the penalty and stand as security for the future payments\r\nwithout the necessity of bringing a fresh action for each payment. In\r\ncases of bonds with special conditions, such as those instanced above,\r\nthe remedy of the obligee for breach of the condition is prescribed by\r\nan act of 1696, the procedure under which is preserved by the Judicature\r\nAct (O. xxii. R. 1, O. xiii. R. 14). The obligee assigns the particular\r\nbreaches of which he complains, damages in respect of such breaches are\r\nassessed, and, on payment into court by the obligor of the amount of\r\nsuch damages, the court enters a stay of execution. A difficulty which\r\nhas much exercised and still exercises the courts is to determine, in\r\nthese cases of special conditions, whether the sum for which the bond is\r\ngiven is a true penalty or only liquidated damages. There is nothing to\r\nprevent the parties to a bond from agreeing the damages for a breach,\r\nand if they have done so, the court will not interfere, as it will in\r\nthe case of a penalty. The leading case on the subject is _Kemble_ v.\r\n_Farren_ (1829; 6 Bing. 148).\r\n\r\nBonds given to secure the doing of anything which is contrary to the\r\npolicy of the law are void. Such, for instance, is a bond given to a\r\nwoman for future cohabitation (as distinguished from past cohabitation),\r\nor a marriage brocage bond, that is, a bond given to procure a marriage\r\nbetween parties. (See the matrimonial agency case, _Hermann_ v.\r\n_Charlesworth_, 1905, 2 K.B. 123). It was not without design that\r\nShakespeare laid the scene of Shylock's suit on Antonio's bond in a\r\nVenetian court; the bond would have had short shrift in an English\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n  _Post Obit Bonds._--A post obit bond is one given by an expectant heir\r\n  or legatee, payable on or after the death of the person from whom the\r\n  obligor has expectations. Such a bond, if the obligee has exacted\r\n  unconscionable terms, may be set aside.\r\n\r\n  _Bottomry Bonds._--A bottomry bond is a contract of hypothecation by\r\n  which the owner of a ship, or the master as his agent, borrows money\r\n  for the use of the ship to meet some emergency, e.g. necessary\r\n  repairs, and pledges the ship (or keel or bottom of the ship, _partem\r\n  pro toto_) as security for repayment. If the ship safely accomplishes\r\n  her voyage, the obligee gets his money back with the agreed interest:\r\n  if the ship is totally lost, he loses it altogether.\r\n\r\n  _Lloyd's Bonds._--Lloyd's bonds are instruments under the seal of a\r\n  railway company, admitting the indebtedness of the company to the\r\n  obligee to a specified amount for work done or goods supplied, with a\r\n  covenant to pay him such amount with interest on a future day. They\r\n  are a device by which railway companies were enabled to increase their\r\n  indebtedness without technically violating their charter. The name is\r\n  derived from the counsel who settled the form of the bond.\r\n\r\n  _Debenture Bonds._--Debenture bonds are bonds secured only by the\r\n  covenant of the company without any floating or fixed charge on the\r\n  assets. (See DEBENTURES AND DEBENTURE STOCK.)\r\n\r\n  _Recognizance._--A recognizance differs from a bond in being entered\r\n  into before a court of record and thereby becoming an obligation of\r\n  record.\r\n\r\n  _Heritable bond_ is a Scots law term, meaning a bond for money, joined\r\n  with a conveyance of land, and held by a creditor as security for his\r\n  debt.\r\n\r\n  For goods \"in bond\" see BONDED WAREHOUSE.     (E. Ma.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] This word, meaning \"that which binds,\" is a phonetic variant of\r\n    \"band,\" and is derived from the Teutonic root seen in _bindan_, to\r\n    bind; it must be distinguished from the obsolete \"bond,\" meaning\r\n    originally a householder. In the laws of Canute this word is used as\r\n    equal to the Old English _ceorl_ (see CHURL), and thus, as the\r\n    churl's position became less free after the Norman Conquest, the\r\n    \"bond\" approximated to the \"villein,\" and still later to the \"serf.\"\r\n    The word is in Old English _bonda_, and appears in \"husband\"\r\n    (q.v.), and is derived from the root of the verb _bua_, to dwell,\r\n    to have a house, the Latin _colere_, and thus in origin is cognate\r\n    with German _Bauer_ and English \"boor.\" The transition in meaning to\r\n    the idea of serfdom, and hence to slavery, is due to an early\r\n    confusion with \"bond,\" from \"bind.\" The same wrong connexion appears\r\n    in the transition of meaning in \"bondage,\" properly \"tenure in\r\n    villeinage,\" but now used as synonymous with \"slavery.\" A trace of\r\n    the early meaning still survives in \"bondager\" (q.v.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONDAGER, a word meaning generally a servant, but specially used in the\r\nsouth of Scotland and Northumberland as the term for a female outworker\r\nwhom a married farm-labourer, living in a cottage attached to the farm,\r\nundertakes as a condition of his tenancy to supply for field-labour,\r\nsometimes also to board and lodge. The origin of the system was a dearth\r\nof field-labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONDE, GUSTAF, COUNT (1620-1667), Swedish statesman. He is remarkable\r\nfor being the persistent advocate of a pacific policy at a time when war\r\non the slightest provocation was the watchword of every Swedish\r\npolitician. Even the popular Polish adventure of Charles X. was\r\nstrenuously opposed by Bonde, though when once it was decided upon he\r\nmaterially assisted the king to find the means for carrying it on. He\r\nwas also in favour of strict economy coupled with the recovery of the\r\nroyal domains which had fallen into the hands of the nobles, though his\r\nnatural partiality for his fellow-peers came out clearly enough when in\r\n1655 he was appointed a member of Charles X.'s land-recovery commission.\r\nIn 1659 he succeeded Herman Fleming as lord high treasurer, and was one\r\nof the council of regency appointed to govern Sweden during the minority\r\nof Charles XI. In 1661 he presented to the senate a plan which aimed at\r\nrendering Sweden altogether independent of foreign subsidies, by a\r\npolicy of peace, economy and trade-development, and by further recovery\r\nof alienated estates. His budget in the following year, framed on the\r\nsame principles, subsequently served as an invaluable guide to Charles\r\nXI. Bonde's extraordinary tenacity of purpose enabled him for some years\r\nto carry out his programme, despite the opposition of the majority of\r\nthe senate and his co-regents, who preferred the more adventurous\r\nmethods of the chancellor Magnus de la Gardie, ultimately so ruinous to\r\nSweden. But the ambition of the oligarchs, and the fear and jealousy of\r\ninnumerable monopolists who rose in arms against his policy of economy,\r\nproved at last too strong for Bonde, while the costly and useless\r\nexpedition against Bremen in 1665, undertaken contrary to his advice,\r\ncompleted the ruin of the finances. In his later years Bonde's powers of\r\nresistance were weakened by sickness and mortification at the triumph of\r\nreckless extravagance, and he practically retired from the government\r\nsome time before his death.\r\n\r\n  See Martin Veibull, _Sveriges Storhetstid_ (Stockholm, 1881).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONDED WAREHOUSE, a warehouse established by the state, or by private\r\nenterprise, in which goods liable to duty are lodged until the duty upon\r\nthem has been paid. Previous to the establishment of bonded warehouses\r\nin England the payment of duties on imported goods had to be made at the\r\ntime of importation, or a bond with security for future payment given to\r\nthe revenue authorities. The inconveniences of this system were many; it\r\nwas not always possible for the importer to find sureties, and he had\r\noften to make an immediate sale of the goods, in order to raise the\r\nduty, frequently selling when the market was depressed and prices low;\r\nthe duty, having to be paid in a lump sum, raised the price of the goods\r\nby the amount of the interest on the capital required to pay the duty;\r\ncompetition was stifled from the fact that large capital was required\r\nfor the importation of the more heavily taxed articles; there was also\r\nthe difficulty of granting an exact equivalent drawback to the exporter,\r\non goods which had already paid duty. To obviate these difficulties and\r\nto put a check upon frauds on the revenue, Sir Robert Walpole proposed\r\nin his \"excise scheme\" of 1733, the system of warehousing, so far as\r\nconcerned tobacco and wine. The proposal, however, was very unpopular,\r\nand it was not till 1803 that the system was actually adopted. By an act\r\nof that year imported goods were to be placed in warehouses approved by\r\nthe customs authorities, and importers were to give \"bonds\" for payment\r\nof duties when the goods were removed. It was from this that the\r\nwarehouses received the name of \"bonded\" or \"bonding.\" The Customs\r\nConsolidation Act 1853 dispensed with the giving of bonds, and laid down\r\nvarious provisions for securing the payment of customs duties on goods\r\nwarehoused. These provisions are contained in the Customs Consolidation\r\nAct 1876, and the amending statutes, the Customs and Inland Revenue Act\r\n1880, and the Revenue Act 1883. The warehouses are known as \"king's\r\nwarehouses,\" and by s. 284 of the act of 1876 are defined as \"any place\r\nprovided by the crown or approved by the commissioners of customs, for\r\nthe deposit of goods for security thereof, and the duties due thereon.\"\r\nBy s. 12 of the same act the treasury may appoint warehousing ports or\r\nplaces, and the commissioners of customs may from time to time approve\r\nand appoint warehouses in such ports or places where goods may be\r\nwarehoused or kept, and fix the amount of rent payable in respect of the\r\ngoods. The proprietor or occupier of every warehouse so approved\r\n(except existing warehouses of special security in respect of which\r\nsecurity by bond has hitherto been dispensed with), or some one on his\r\nbehalf, must, before any goods be warehoused therein, give security by\r\nbond, or such other security as the commissioners may approve of, for\r\nthe payment of the full duties chargeable on any goods warehoused\r\ntherein, or for the due exportation thereof (s. 13). All goods deposited\r\nin a warehouse, without payment of duty on the first importation, upon\r\nbeing entered for home consumption, are chargeable with existing duties\r\non like goods under any customs acts in force at the time of passing\r\nsuch entry (s. 19). The act also prescribes various rules for the\r\nunshipping, landing, examination, warehousing and custody of goods, and\r\nthe penalties on breach. The system of warehousing has proved of great\r\nadvantage both to importers and purchasers, as the payment of duty is\r\ndeferred until the goods are required, while the title-deeds, or\r\nwarrants, are transferable by endorsement.\r\n\r\nWhile the goods are in the warehouse (\"in bond\") the owner may subject\r\nthem to various processes necessary to fit them for the market, such as\r\nthe repacking and mixing of tea, the racking, vatting, mixing and\r\nbottling of wines and spirits, the roasting of coffee, the manufacture\r\nof certain kinds of tobacco, &c., and certain specific allowances are\r\nmade in respect of waste arising from such processes or from leakage,\r\nevaporation and the like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONDU, a French protectorate in West Africa, dependent on the colony of\r\nSenegal. Bondu lies between the Faleme river and the upper course of the\r\nGambia, that is between 13 deg. and 15 deg. N., and 12 deg. and 13 deg.\r\nW. The country is an elevated plateau, with hills in the southern and\r\ncentral parts. These are generally unproductive, and covered with\r\nstunted wood; but the lower country is fertile, and finely clothed with\r\nthe baobab, the tamarind and various valuable fruit-trees. Bondu is\r\ntraversed by torrents, which flow rapidly during the rains but are empty\r\nin the dry season, such streams being known in this part of West Africa\r\nas _marigots_. The inhabitants are mostly Fula, though the trade is\r\nlargely in the hands of Mandingos. The religion and laws of the country\r\nare Mahommedan, though the precepts of that faith are not very\r\nrigorously observed. Mungo Park, the first European traveller to visit\r\nthe country, passed through Bondu in 1795, and had to submit to many\r\nexactions from the reigning prince. The royal residence was then at\r\nFatteconda; but when Major W. Gray, a British officer who attempted to\r\nsolve the Niger problem, visited Bondu in 1818 it had been removed to\r\nBulibani, a small town, with about 3000 population, surrounded by a\r\nstrong clay wall. In August 1845 the king of Bondu signed a treaty\r\nrecognizing French sovereignty over his country. The treaty was\r\ndisregarded by the natives, but in 1858 Bondu came definitely under\r\nFrench control. The country has since enjoyed considerable prosperity\r\n(see SENEGAL).\r\n\r\n  See A. Rancon, _Le Bondou: etude de geographie et d'histoire\r\n  soudaniennes de 1681 a nos jours_ (Bordeaux, 1894).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONE, HENRY (1755-1834), English enamel painter, was born at Truro. He\r\nwas much employed by London jewellers for small designs in enamel,\r\nbefore his merits as an artist were well known to the public. In 1800\r\nthe beauty of his pieces attracted the notice of the Royal Academy, of\r\nwhich he was then admitted as an associate; in 1811 he was made an\r\nacademician. Up to 1831 he executed many beautiful miniature pieces of\r\nmuch larger size than had been attempted before in England; among these\r\nhis eighty-five portraits of the time of Queen Elizabeth, of different\r\nsizes, from 5 by 4 to 13 by 8 in. are most admired. They were disposed\r\nof by public sale after his death. His Bacchus and Ariadne, after\r\nTitian, painted on a plate, brought the great price of 2200 guineas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONE (a word common in various forms to Teutonic languages, in many of\r\nwhich it is confined to the shank of the leg, as in the German _Bein_),\r\nthe hard tissue constituting the framework of the animal skeleton. For\r\nanatomy see SKELETON and CONNECTIVE TISSUES.\r\n\r\nBONE DISEASES AND INJURIES.--The more specific diseases affecting the\r\nbones of the human body are treated under separate headings; in this\r\narticle _inflammation of bone_ and _fractures_ are dealt with.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ostitis.\r\n\r\n_Ostitis_ ([Greek: osteon], bone), or inflammation of bone, may be acute\r\nor chronic. _Acute ostitis_ is one of the most serious diseases which\r\ncan be met with in young people. It is due to the cultivation of\r\nvirulent germs in the delicate growing tissue of the bone and in the\r\nmarrow. Another name for it is _septic osteomyelitis_, which has the\r\nadvantage of expressing the cause as well as the exact seat ([Greek:\r\nmyelos], marrow) of the inflammation. The name of the micro-organism\r\ncausing the inflammation is _Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus_, which\r\nmeans that the germs collect in clusters like grapes, that they are of\r\nthe virulent pus-producing kind, and that they have a yellow tinge. As a\r\nrule, the germs find their way to the bone by the blood-stream, which\r\nthey have entered through the membrane lining the mouth or gullet, or\r\nsome other part of the alimentary canal. In the pre-antiseptic days they\r\noften entered the sawn bone during the amputation of a limb, and were\r\nnot infrequently the cause of blood-poisoning and death. When the\r\nindividual is well and strong, and there has been no hurt, strain or\r\naccident to lower the power of resistance of the bone, the staphylococci\r\nmay circulate harmlessly in the blood, until they are gradually eaten up\r\nby the white corpuscles; but if a bone has been injured it offers a\r\nlikely and attractive focus to the wandering germs.\r\n\r\nThe disease is infective. That is to say, the micro-organisms having\r\nbegun to germinate in the damaged bone find their way by the\r\nblood-stream into other tissues, and developing after their kind, are\r\napt to cause blood-poisoning. Should a surgeon prick his finger whilst\r\noperating on a case of septic osteomyelitis his blood also might be\r\npoisoned, and he would run the risk of losing his finger, his hand, or\r\neven his life. The starting-point of the disease is the delicate growing\r\ntissue recently deposited between the main part of the shaft of the bone\r\n(diaphysis) and the cartilaginous end. And it often happens that the\r\nearliest complaint of pain is just above or below the knee; just above\r\nthe ankle, the elbow or the wrist. If the surgeon is prompt in operating\r\nhe may find the disease limited to that spot. In the case of infants,\r\nthe germs are very apt to make their way into the neighbouring joint,\r\ngiving rise to the very serious disease known as _acute arthritis of\r\ninfants_.\r\n\r\nProbably the first sign of there being anything amiss with the limb will\r\nbe a complaint of aches or pains near a joint; and these pains are apt\r\nto be miscalled rheumatic. Perhaps they occur during convalescence from\r\nscarlet or typhoid fever, or after exposure to injury, or to wet or\r\ncold, or after unusual fatigue. The part becomes swollen, hot, red and\r\nexcessively tender; the tenderness, however, is not in the skin but in\r\nthe bone, and in the engorged membrane around it, the periosteum. The\r\ntemperature may run up to 104 deg., and may be associated with\r\nconvulsions or shiverings. The patient's nights are disturbed, and very\r\nlikely he has violent delirium. If the case is allowed to drift on,\r\nabscess forms, and death may ensue from septic pneumonia, or\r\npericarditis, or from some other form of blood-poisoning.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the disease is recognized an incision should be made down to\r\nthe bone, and the affected area should be scraped out, and disinfected\r\nwith a solution of corrosive sublimate. A considerable area of the bone\r\nmay be found stripped bare by sub-periosteal abscess, and necrosis is\r\nlikely to ensue. Perhaps the shaft of the bone will have to be opened up\r\nin the chief part of its length in order that it may be cleared of germs\r\nand pus. The surgeon is more apt to err on the side of doing too little\r\nin these serious cases than too much. It may be that the whole of that\r\npiece of bone (diaphysis) which lies between the joint-ends is found\r\nloose in a large abscess cavity, and in some cases immediate amputation\r\nof the limb may be found necessary in order to save life; in other\r\ncases, amputation may be called for later because of long-continued\r\nsuppuration and grave constitutional disturbance. Several bones may be\r\naffected at the same time, and large pieces of them may be killed\r\noutright (_multiple necrosis_) by inflammatory engorgement and\r\ndevastating abscess.\r\n\r\nSeptic ostitis may be confounded with erysipelas and rheumatism, but\r\nthe central thickening and tenderness should suffice to distinguish it.\r\n\r\n_Chronic ostitis_ and _periostitis_ denote long-continued and increased\r\nvascular supply. This may be due to injury, syphilis or rheumatism. The\r\ndisease is found chiefly in the shafts of the bones. There is a dull\r\npain in the bone, which is worse at night, and the inflamed piece of\r\nbone is thickened and tender. The lump thus formed is called a _hard\r\nnode_, and its outline shows clearly by X-rays. The affected limb should\r\nbe rested and kept elevated. Leeches and fomentations may ease the pain,\r\nand iodide of potassium is the most useful medicine.\r\n\r\n_Chronic inflammation of tuberculous origin_ affects the soft,\r\ncancellated tissue of such bones as the vertebrae, and the bones of the\r\nhands and feet, as well as the spongy ends of the long bones. In\r\ntuberculous ostitis the presence of the bacilli in the spongy tissue\r\ncauses an escape of colourless corpuscles from the blood, which,\r\ncollecting around the bacilli, form a small greyish white heap, a\r\n_tubercle_. These tubercles may be present in large numbers at the\r\nexpense of the living tissue, and a _rarefying ostitis_ is thus\r\nproduced. Later the tubercles break down and form tuberculous abscesses,\r\nwhich slowly, and almost painlessly, find escape upon the surface. They\r\nshould not be allowed to open spontaneously, however, as the wounds are\r\nthen likely to become infected with pus-producing germs, and fuel being\r\nadded to the fire, as it were, destruction advances with increased\r\nrapidity. The treatment for these tuberculous foci is to place the limb\r\nor the part at absolute rest upon a splint, to give plenty of fresh air\r\nto the patient, and to prescribe cod-liver oil and iron. And when it is\r\nseen that in spite of the adoption of these measures the tuberculous\r\nabscess is advancing towards the surface, the surgeon should cut down\r\nupon the part, scrape out the foci, and disinfect with some strong\r\nantiseptic lotion. Consideration should also be given to the treatment\r\nby injection of tuberculin.\r\n\r\n_Caries_ (rottenness, decay) is the name given to tuberculous disease of\r\nbone when the tubercles are running together and are breaking down the\r\ncancellous tissue. In short, caries generally means tuberculous ostitis,\r\nthough syphilitic ulceration of bone has also received the same name.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Fracture.\r\n\r\n_Fractures._--A bone may be broken at the part where it is struck\r\n(fracture from direct violence), or it may break in consequence of a\r\nstrain applied to it (fracture from indirect violence), or the fracture\r\nmay be due to muscular action as when a violent cough causes a rib to\r\nbreak. In the first case the fracture is generally transverse and in the\r\nsecond more or less oblique. The fully developed bone is broken fairly\r\nacross; the soft bones of young people may simply be bent--_green stick_\r\nor _willow fracture._ Fractures are either _simple_ or _compound_. A\r\nsimple fracture is analogous to the subcutaneous laceration in the soft\r\nparts, and a compound one to an open wound in the soft parts. The wound\r\nof the soft parts in the compound fracture may be due either to the\r\nforce which caused the fracture, as in the case of a cart-wheel going\r\nover a limb, first wounding the soft parts and then fracturing the bone,\r\nor to the sharp point of the fractured bone coming out through the skin.\r\nIn either case there is a communication between the external air and\r\ninjured bone, and the probability arises of the germs of suppuration\r\nfinding their way to the seat of fracture. This greatly increases the\r\nrisks of the case, for septic inflammation and suppuration may lead to\r\ndelayed union, to death of large pieces of the bone (necrosis), and to\r\nosteomyelitis and to blood-poisoning. In the treatment of a fracture,\r\nevery care should be taken to prevent any sharp fragment coming near the\r\nskin. Careless handling has often been the means of a simple fracture\r\nbeing converted into a compound one.\r\n\r\nIn most cases of fracture _crepitus_ can be made out; this is the\r\nfeeling elicited when two rough osseous surfaces are rubbed together.\r\nWhen a bone is merely bent there is, of course, no crepitus. It is also\r\nabsent in fractures in which the broken extremities are driven into one\r\nanother (impacted fracture). In order to get firm bony union it is\r\nnecessary to secure accurate apposition of the fragments. Putting the\r\nbroken ends together is termed \"setting the fracture,\" and the needful\r\namount of rest is obtained by the use of splints. As a rule, it is also\r\nadvisable to fix with the splint the joint above or below the fracture.\r\nIn cases in which a splintering of the bone into a joint has taken\r\nplace, more especially in those cases in which tendons have been\r\ninjured, there may be a good deal of effusion into the joint and the\r\ntendon sheaths, and this may be organized into fibrous tissue leading to\r\npermanent stiffness. This is particularly apt to occur in old people.\r\nCare must be taken in such instances by gentle exercises, and by passive\r\nmovement during the process of cure, to keep the joint and tendons free.\r\nTo take a common example,--in fracture close to the wrist joint, it is\r\nnecessary to arrange the splint so that the patient can move his fingers\r\nand thumb, and the splint must be taken off every day, in order that the\r\nwrist and fingers may be gently bent, straightened and exercised.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of fractures has undergone considerable improvement of\r\nlate years. Simple fractures are not kept so long at rest in splints,\r\nbut are constantly \"taken down\" in order that massage and movements of\r\nthe limb may be resorted to. This, of course, is done with the utmost\r\ngentleness, and with the result that swelling, pain and other evidences\r\nof the serious injury quickly disappear, whilst a more rapid and\r\ncomplete recovery is ensured. Stiff hands and feet after fracture are\r\nmuch less frequently met with. By the aid of the X-rays it is now easy\r\nfor the surgeon to assure himself that fractured surfaces have been well\r\nadjusted and are in close apposition. But if they are not in a\r\nsatisfactory position, and it be found impracticable to assure their\r\nclose adjustment by ordinary methods, the surgeon now, without undue\r\nloss of time, cuts down upon the broken ends and fixes them together by\r\na strong wire suture, which remains permanently in the tissues. If the\r\nfracture be associated with an open wound of the part (compound\r\nfracture), and the broken ends are found incapable of easy adjustment,\r\nimmediate wiring together of the fragments is now considered to be a\r\nnecessary part of the primary treatment. The French surgeon, Just\r\nLucas-Championniere, has done more than any one else to show the\r\nadvantage of discreet movements, of massage and of exercises in the\r\ntreatment of fractures.\r\n\r\n_Special Fracture in Young People._--The long bones of children and\r\ngrowing persons consist of a shaft with cartilaginous ends in which bone\r\nis developed. As the result of injury, the end of the bone may become\r\ndetached, a variety of fracture known as _diastasis_. Such a\r\nfracture--however well treated--may be followed by arrest of growth of\r\nthe bone or by stiffness of the neighbouring joint.\r\n\r\n_Delayed union_ means that consolidation is taking place very slowly, if\r\nat all. This may be due to local or constitutional causes, but provided\r\nthe bones are in good position, nothing further than patience, with\r\nmassage, and with due attention to general health-measures, is\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nAn _ununited fracture_ is one in which after many weeks or months no\r\nattempt has been made by nature to consolidate the parts. This may be\r\ndue to the ends not having been brought close enough together; to the\r\nseat of fracture having been constantly disturbed; to muscle or tendon\r\nbeing interposed between the broken ends, or to the existence of some\r\nconstitutional defect in the patient. Except in the last-named\r\ncondition, the treatment consists in cutting down to the broken ends;\r\nfreshening them up by sawing off a thin slice, and by adjusting and\r\nfixing them by a wire or screw. Ununited fracture of the leg-bones in\r\nchildren is a most unsatisfactory and rebellious condition to deal with.\r\n\r\nThere is still a difference of opinion as to the best way of treating a\r\nrecent _fracture of the patella_ (knee-cap). Many surgeons are still\r\ncontent to follow the old plan of fixing the limb on a back-splint, or\r\nin plaster of Paris splints, and awaiting the result. It is beyond\r\nquestion that a large percentage of these cases recover with a perfectly\r\nuseful limb--especially if the fibrous bond of union between the pieces\r\nof the broken knee-cap is adequately protected against being stretched\r\nby bending the leg at too early a date. But in some cases the fragments\r\nhave been eventually found wide apart, the patient being left with an\r\nenfeebled limb. Still, at any rate, this line of treatment was\r\nunassociated with risk. But after Lister showed (1883) that with due\r\ncare and cleanliness the knee-joint could be opened, and the fragments\r\nof the broken patella secured in close apposition by a stout wire\r\nsuture, the treatment of the injury underwent a remarkable change. The\r\ngreat advantage of Lister's treatment was that the fragments, being\r\nfixed close together by the wire stitch, became solidly united by bone,\r\nand the joint became as sound as it was before. Some surgeons, however,\r\nobjected to the operation--in spite of the excellence of the results\r\nobtainable by it--because of the undoubted risk which it entailed of the\r\njoint becoming invaded by septic micro-organisms. As a sort of\r\ncompromise, Professor A.E.J. Barker introduced the method, which he\r\ndeemed to be less hazardous, of holding the fragments close together by\r\nmeans of a strong silver wire passed round them vertically by a large\r\nneedle without actually laying open the joint. But experience has shown\r\nthat in the hands of careful and skilful surgeons Lister's operation of\r\nopenly wiring the fragments gives a perfect result with a comparatively\r\nsmall risk. Other surgeons secure the fragments in close contact for\r\nbony union by passing a silk or metal suture around them\r\ncircumferentially. Many years ago Lister remarked that the careful\r\nselection of one's patients is an antiseptic measure--by which he meant\r\nthat if a surgeon intended to get the most perfect results for his\r\noperative work, he must carefully consider whether any individual\r\npatient is physically adapted for the performance upon him of any\r\nparticular operation. This aphorism implies that not every patient with\r\na broken knee-cap is suited for the opening of his knee-joint, or even\r\nfor the subcutaneous adjustment of the broken fragments. An operative\r\nprocedure which is admirably suited for one patient might result in\r\ndisaster when adopted for another, and it is an important part of the\r\nsurgeon's business to know what to advise in each individual case.\r\n     (E. O.*)\r\n\r\n  _Industrial Applications of Bones._--By the increasing inventiveness\r\n  of man, the industrial utilization of animal bone has been so\r\n  developed that not one of the constituents fails to reappear in\r\n  commerce. Composed of mineral matter--phosphates, &c.--fat and\r\n  gelatinous substances, the phosphates are used as artificial manures,\r\n  the fat is worked up by the soap-maker and chandler, and the\r\n  gelatinous matter forms the basis of the gelatin and glue of commerce;\r\n  while by the dry distillation of bones from which the gelatin has been\r\n  but partially removed, there are obtained a carbonaceous\r\n  residue--animal charcoal--and a tarry distillate, from which \"bone\r\n  oil\" and bone pitch are obtained. To these by-products there must be\r\n  added the direct uses of bone--for making buttons, knife-handles,\r\n  &c.--when an estimate is desired of the commercial importance of these\r\n  components of the animal frame.\r\n\r\n  While most of the world's supply of bones goes to the glue and gelatin\r\n  works, the leg and thigh bones, termed \"marrows\" and \"knuckles,\" are\r\n  used for the manufacture of bone articles. The treatment which they\r\n  receive is very different from that practised in the glue-works. The\r\n  ends are removed by a saw, and the bones are steeped in a 1% brine\r\n  solution for three to four days, in order to separate the fibrous\r\n  matter. The bones are now heated with water, and allowed to simmer for\r\n  about six hours. This removes a part of the fat and gelatinous matter;\r\n  the former rises as a scum, the latter passes into solution, and the\r\n  bones remain sufficiently firm to be worked up by the lathe, &c. The\r\n  fat is skimmed off, and, after bleaching, reappears as a component of\r\n  fine soaps, or, if unbleached, the oil is expressed and is used as an\r\n  adulterant of other oils, while the stearine or solid matter goes to\r\n  the candle-maker; the gelatinous water is used (after filtration) for\r\n  making size for cardboard boxes; while the bones are scrubbed, dried,\r\n  and then transferred to the bone-worker.\r\n\r\n  The glue-worker first removes the fat, which is supplied to the soap\r\n  and candle trades; the bones are now treated for glue (q.v.); and\r\n  the residue is worked up for manures, &c. These residues are ground to\r\n  a fine or coarse meal, and supplied either directly as a fertilizer or\r\n  treated with sulphuric acid to form the more soluble superphosphates,\r\n  which are more readily assimilated by growing plants. In some places,\r\n  especially South America, the residues are burned in a retort to a\r\n  white ash, the \"bone-ash\" of commerce, which contains some 70-80% of\r\n  tricalcium phosphate, and is much used as a manure, and in the\r\n  manufacture of high-grade superphosphates. In the gelatin industry\r\n  (see GELATIN) the mineral matter has to be recovered from its solution\r\n  in hydrochloric acid. To effect this, the liquors are freed from\r\n  suspended matter by filtration, and then run into vats where they are\r\n  mixed with milk of lime, or some similar neutralizer. The slightly\r\n  soluble bicalcium phosphate, CaHPO4, is first precipitated, which,\r\n  with more lime, gives ordinary tricalcium phosphate, Ca3(PO4)2. The\r\n  contents of the vats are filter-pressed, and the cakes dried on\r\n  plates supported on racks in heated chambers. This product is a very\r\n  valuable manure, and is also used in the manufacture of phosphorus.\r\n\r\n  Instead of extracting all the gelatinous matter from degreased bones,\r\n  the practice of extracting about one half and carbonizing the residue\r\n  is frequently adopted. The bones are heated in horizontal cast-iron\r\n  retorts, holding about 5 cwt., and the operation occupies about twelve\r\n  to thirteen hours. The residue in the retorts is removed while still\r\n  red-hot to air-tight vessels in which it is allowed to cool. It is\r\n  then passed through grinding mills, and is subsequently riddled by\r\n  revolving cylindrical sieves. The yield is from 55 to 60% of the bones\r\n  carbonized, and the product contains about 10% of carbon and about 75%\r\n  of calcium phosphate, the remainder being various inorganic salts and\r\n  moisture (6-7%). Animal charcoal has a deep black colour, and is much\r\n  used as a filtering and clarifying material. The vapours evolved\r\n  during carbonization are condensed in vertical air condensers. The\r\n  liquid separates into two layers: the upper tarry layer is floated off\r\n  and redistilled; the distillate is termed \"bone oil,\"[1] and mainly\r\n  consists of many fatty amines and pyridine derivatives, characterized\r\n  by a most disgusting odour; the residue is \"bone pitch,\" and finds\r\n  application in the manufacture of black varnishes and like\r\n  compositions. The lower layer is ammoniacal liquor; it is transferred\r\n  to stills, distilled with steam, and the ammonia received in sulphuric\r\n  acid; the ammonium sulphate, which separates, is removed, drained and\r\n  dried, and is principally used as a manure. Both during the\r\n  carbonization of the bones and the distillation of the tar inflammable\r\n  gases are evolved; these are generally used, after purification, for\r\n  motive or illuminating purposes.     (C. E.*)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] Bone oil, also known as Dippel's oil, was originally produced by\r\n    the distillation of stags' horns; it is of interest in the history of\r\n    chemistry, since from it were isolated in 1846 by T. Anderson\r\n    pyridine and some of its homologues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONE BED, a term loosely used by geologists when speaking generally of\r\nany stratum or deposit which contains bones of whatever kind. It is also\r\napplied to those brecciated and stalagmitic deposits on the floor of\r\ncaves, which frequently contain osseous remains. In a more restricted\r\nsense it is used to connote certain thin layers of bony fragments, which\r\noccur upon well-defined geological horizons. One of the best-known of\r\nthese is the Ludlow Bone Bed, which is found at the base of the Downton\r\nSandstone in the Upper Ludlow series. At Ludlow itself, two such beds\r\nare actually known, separated by about 14 ft. of strata. Although quite\r\nthin, the Ludlow Bone Bed can be followed from that town into\r\nGloucestershire for a distance of 45 m. It is almost made up of\r\nfragments of spines, teeth and scales of ganoid fish. Another well-known\r\nbed, formerly known as the \"Bristol\" or \"Lias\" Bone Bed, exists in the\r\nform of several thin layers of micaceous sandstone, with the remains of\r\nfish and saurians, which occur in the Rhaetic Black Paper Shales that\r\nlie above the Keuper marls in the south-west of England. It is\r\nnoteworthy that a similar bone bed has been traced on the same\r\ngeological horizon in Brunswick, Hanover and Franconia. A bone bed has\r\nalso been observed at the base of the Carboniferous limestone series in\r\ncertain parts of the south-west of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONE-LACE, a kind of lace made upon a cushion from linen thread; the\r\npattern is marked out with pins, round which are twisted the different\r\nthreads, each wound on its own bobbin. The lace was so called from the\r\nfact that bobbins were formerly made of bone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONER (or BONERIUS), ULRICH (fl. 14th century), German-Swiss writer of\r\nfables, was born in Bern. He was descended of an old Bernese family,\r\nand, as far as can be ascertained, took clerical orders and became a\r\nmonk; yet as it appears that he subsequently married, it is certain that\r\nhe received the \"tonsure\" only, and was thus entitled to the benefit of\r\nthe _clerici uxoriati_, who, on divesting themselves of the clerical\r\ngarb, could return to secular life. He is mentioned in records between\r\n1324 and 1349, but neither before nor after these dates. He wrote, in\r\nMiddle High German, a collection of fables entitled _Der Edelstein_ (c.\r\n1349), one hundred in number, which were based principally on those of\r\nAvianus (4th century) and the _Anonymus_ (edited by I. Nevelet, 1610).\r\nThis work he dedicated to the Bernese patrician and poet, Johann von\r\nRinkenberg, advocatus (_Vogt_) of Brienz (d. c. 1350). It was printed in\r\n1461 at Bamberg; and it is claimed for it that it was the first book\r\nprinted in the German language. Boner treats his sources with\r\nconsiderable freedom and originality; he writes a clear and simple\r\nstyle, and the necessarily didactic tone of the collection is relieved\r\nby touches of humour.\r\n\r\n  _Der Edelstein_ has been edited by G.F. Benecke (Berlin, 1816) and\r\n  Franz Pfeiffer (Leipzig, 1844); a translation into modern German by K.\r\n  Pannier will be found, in Reclam's _Universal-Bibliothek_ (Leipzig,\r\n  1895). See also G.E. Lessing in _Zur Geschichte und Literatur_\r\n  (_Werke_, ix.); C. Waas, _Die Quellen der Beispiele Boners_ (Giessen,\r\n  1897).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBO'NESS, or BORROWSTOUNNESS, a municipal and police burgh and seaport of\r\nLinlithgowshire, Scotland. Pop. (1891) 6295; (1901) 9306. It lies on the\r\nsouthern shore of the Firth of Forth, 17 m. W. by N. of Edinburgh, and\r\n24 m. by rail, being the terminus of the North British railway's branch\r\nline from Manuel. In the 18th century it ranked next to Leith as a port,\r\nbut the growth of Grangemouth, higher up the firth, seriously affected\r\nits shipping trade, which is, however, yet considerable, coal and\r\npig-iron forming the principal exports, and pit props from the Baltic\r\nthe leading import. It has an extensive harbour (the area of the dock\r\nbeing 7-3/4 acres). The great industries are coal-mining--some of the\r\npits extending for a long distance beneath the firth--iron-founding\r\n(with several blast furnaces) and engineering, but it has also important\r\nmanufactures of salt, soap, vitriol and other chemicals. Shipbuilding\r\nand whaling are extinct. Traces of the wall of Antoninus which ran\r\nthrough the parish may still be made out, especially near Inveravon.\r\nBlackness, on the coast farther east, was the seaport of Linlithgow till\r\nthe rise of Bo'ness, but its small export trade now mainly consists of\r\ncoal, bricks, tiles and lime. Its castle, standing on a promontory, is\r\nof unknown age. James III. of Scotland is stated to have consigned\r\ncertain of the insurgent nobles to its cells; and later it was used as a\r\nprison in which many of the Covenanters were immured. It was one of the\r\nfour castles that had to be maintained by the Articles of Union, but\r\nwhen its uselessness for defensive purposes became apparent, it was\r\nconverted into an ammunition depot. Kinneil House, 1 m. south of\r\nBo'ness, a seat of the duke of Hamilton, formerly a keep, was fortified\r\nby the regent Arran, plundered by the rebels in Queen Mary's reign, and\r\nreconstructed in the time of Charles II. Dr John Roebuck (1718-1794),\r\nfounder of the Carron Iron Works, occupied it for several years from\r\n1764. It was here that, on his invitation, James Watt constructed a\r\nmodel of his steam-engine, which was tested in a now disused colliery.\r\nThough Roebuck lost all his money in the coal-mines and salt works which\r\nhe established at Bo'ness, the development of the mineral resources of\r\nthe district may be regarded as due to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONFIGLI, BENEDETTO, 15th century Italian painter, was born at Perugia.\r\nUntil near the middle of the 15th century the Umbrian school was far\r\nbehind those of Florence and the North, but in the person of Perugino\r\nand some of his followers it suddenly advanced into the very first rank.\r\nAmong the latter none holds a more distinguished place than Benedetto\r\nBonfigli. The most important of his extant works are a series, in\r\nfresco, of the life of St Louis of Toulouse, in the communal palace of\r\nPerugia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONFIRE (in Early English \"bone-fire,\" Scottish \"bane-fire\"), originally\r\na fire of bones, now any large fire lit in the open air on an occasion\r\nof rejoicing. Though the spelling \"bonfire\" was used in the 16th\r\ncentury, the earlier \"bone-fire\" was common till 1760. The earliest\r\nknown instance of the derivation of the word occurred as _ban fyre ignis\r\nossium_ in the _Catholicon Anglicum_, A.D. 1483. Other derivations, now\r\nrejected, have been sought for the word. Thus some have thought it\r\n_Baal-fire_, passing through _Bael_, _Baen_ to _Bane_. Others have\r\ndeclared it to be _boon_-fire by analogy with _boen-harow_, i.e.\r\n\"harrowing by gift,\" the suggestion being that these fires were\r\n\"contribution\" fires, every one in the neighbourhood contributing a\r\nportion of the material, just as in Northumberland the \"contributed\r\nPloughing Days\" are known as _Bone-daags_.\r\n\r\nWhatever the origin of the word, it has long had several meanings-(a) a\r\nfire of bones, (b) a fire for corpses, a funeral pile, (c) a fire for\r\nimmolation, such as that in which heretics and proscribed books were\r\nburnt, (d) a large fire lit in the open air, on occasions of national\r\nrejoicing, or as a signal of alarm such as the bonfires which warned\r\nEngland of the approach of the Armada. Throughout Europe the peasants\r\nfrom time immemorial have lighted bonfires on certain days of the year,\r\nand danced around or leapt over them. This custom can be traced back to\r\nthe middle ages, and certain usages in antiquity so nearly resemble it\r\nas to suggest that the bonfire has its origin in the early days of\r\nheathen Europe. Indeed the earliest proof of the observance of these\r\nbonfire ceremonies in Europe is afforded by the attempts made by\r\nChristian synods in the 7th and 8th centuries to suppress them as pagan.\r\nThus the third council of Constantinople (A.D. 680), by its 65th canon,\r\norders: \"Those fires that are kindled by certaine people on new moones\r\nbefore their shops and houses, over which also they use ridiculously and\r\nfoolishly to leape, by a certaine antient custome, we command them from\r\nhenceforth to cease.\" And the Synodus Francica under Pope Zachary, A.D.\r\n742, forbids \"those sacrilegious fires which they call _Nedfri_ (or\r\nbonefires), and all other observations of the Pagans whatsoever.\"\r\nLeaping over the fires is mentioned among the superstitious rites used\r\nat the Palilia (the feast of Pales, the shepherds' goddess) in Ovid's\r\n_Fasti_, when the shepherds lit heaps of straw and jumped over them as\r\nthey burned. The lighting of the bonfires in Christian festivals was\r\nsignificant of the compromise made with the heathen by the early Church.\r\nIn Cornwall bonfires are lighted on the eve of St John the Baptist and\r\nSt Peter's day, and midsummer is thence called in Cornish _Goluan_,\r\nwhich means both \"light\" and \"festivity.\" Sometimes effigies are burned\r\nin these fires, or a pretence is made of burning a living person in\r\nthem, and there are grounds for believing that anciently human\r\nsacrifices were actually made in the bonfires. Spring and midsummer are\r\nthe usual times at which these bonfires are lighted, but in some\r\ncountries they are made at Hallowe'en (October 31) and at Christmas. In\r\nspring the 1st Sunday in Lent, Easter eve and the 1st of May are the\r\ncommonest dates.\r\n\r\n  See J.G. Frazer, _Golden Bough_, vol. iii., for a very full account of\r\n  the bonfire customs of Europe, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONGARS, JACQUES (1554-1612), French scholar and diplomatist, was born\r\nat Orleans, and was brought up in the reformed faith. He obtained his\r\nearly education at Marburg and Jena, and returning to France continued\r\nhis studies at Orleans and Bourges. After spending some time in Rome he\r\nvisited eastern Europe, and subsequently made the acquaintance of Segur\r\nPardaillan, a representative of Henry, king of Navarre, afterwards Henry\r\nIV. of France. He entered the service of Pardaillan, and in 1587 was\r\nsent on a mission to many of the princes of northern Europe, after which\r\nhe visited England to obtain help from Queen Elizabeth for Henry of\r\nNavarre. He continued to serve Henry as a diplomatist, and in 1593\r\nbecame the representative of the French king at the courts of the\r\nimperial princes. Vigorously seconding the efforts of Henry to curtail\r\nthe power of the house of Habsburg, he spent health and money\r\nungrudgingly in this service, and continued his labours until the king's\r\nmurder in 1610. He then returned to France, and died at Paris on the\r\n29th of July 1612. Bongars wrote an abridgment of Justin's abridgment of\r\nthe history of Trogus Pompeius under the title _Justinus, Trogi Pompeii\r\nHistoriarum Philippicarum epitoma de manuscriptis codicibus emendatior\r\net prologis auctior_ (Paris, 1581). He collected the works of several\r\nFrench writers who as contemporaries described the crusades, and\r\npublished them under the title _Gesta Dei per Francos_ (Hanover, 1611).\r\nAnother collection made by Bongars is the _Rerum Hungaricarum scriptores\r\nvarii_ (Frankfort, 1600). His _Epistolae_ were published at Leiden in\r\n1647, and a French translation at Paris in 1668-1670. Many of his papers\r\nare preserved in the library at Bern, to which they were presented in\r\n1632, and a list of them was made in 1634. Other papers and copies of\r\ninstructions are now in several libraries in Paris; and copies of other\r\ninstructions are in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n  See H. Hagen, _Jacobus Bongarsius_ (Bern, 1874); L. Anquez, _Henri IV\r\n  et l'Allemagne_ (Paris, 1887).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONGHI, RUGGERO (1828-1895), Italian scholar, writer and politician, was\r\nborn at Naples on the 20th of March 1828. Exiled from Naples in\r\nconsequence of the movement of 1848, he took refuge in Tuscany, whence\r\nhe was compelled to flee to Turin on account of a pungent article\r\nagainst the Bourbons. At Turin he resumed his philosophic studies and\r\nhis translation of Plato, but in 1858 refused a professorship of Greek\r\nat Pavia, under the Austrian government, only to accept it in 1859 from\r\nthe Italian government after the liberation of Lombardy. In 1860, with\r\nthe Cavour party, he opposed the work of Garibaldi, Crispi and Bertani\r\nat Naples, and became secretary of Luigi Carlo Farini during the\r\nlatter's lieutenancy, but in 1865 assumed contemporaneously the\r\neditorship of the _Perseveranza_ of Milan and the chair of Latin\r\nliterature at Florence. Elected deputy in 1860 he became celebrated by\r\nthe biting wit of his speeches, while, as journalist, the acrimony of\r\nhis polemical writings made him a redoubtable adversary. Though an\r\nardent supporter of the historic Right, and, as such, entrusted by the\r\nLanza cabinet with the defence of the law of guarantees in 1870, he was\r\nno respecter of persons, his caustic tongue sparing neither friend nor\r\nfoe. Appointed minister for public instruction in 1873, he, with\r\nfeverish activity, reformed the Italian educational system, suppressed\r\nthe privileges of the university of Naples, founded the Vittorio\r\nEmanuele library in Rome, and prevented the establishment of a Catholic\r\nuniversity in the capital. Upon the fall of the Right from power in 1876\r\nhe joined the opposition, and, with characteristic vivacity, protracted\r\nduring two months the debate on Baccelli's University Reform Bill,\r\nsecuring, single-handed, its rejection. A bitter critic of King Humbert,\r\nboth in the _Perseveranza_ and in the _Nuova Antologia_, he was, in\r\n1893, excluded from court, only securing readmission shortly before his\r\ndeath on the 22nd of October 1895. In foreign policy a Francophil, he\r\ncombated the Triple Alliance, and took considerable part in the\r\norganization of the inter-parliamentary peace conference.     (H. W. S.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONGO (DOR or DERAN), a tribe of Nilotic negroes, probably related to\r\nthe Zandeh tribes of the Welle district, inhabiting the south-west\r\nportion of the Bahr-el-Ghazal province, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. G.A.\r\nSchweinfurth, who lived two years among them, declares that before the\r\nadvent of the slave-raiders, c. 1850, they numbered at least 300,000.\r\nSlave-raiders, and later the dervishes, greatly reduced their numbers,\r\nand it was not until the establishment of effective control by the Sudan\r\ngovernment (1904-1906) that recuperation was possible. The Bongo\r\nformerly lived in countless little independent and peaceful communities,\r\nand under the Sudan government they again manage their own affairs.\r\nTheir huts are well built, and sometimes 24 ft. high. The Bongo are a\r\nrace of medium height, inclined to be thick-set, with a red-brown\r\ncomplexion--\"like the soil upon which they reside\"--and black hair.\r\nSchweinfurth declares their heads to be nearly round, no other African\r\nrace, to his knowledge, possessing a higher cephalic index. The women\r\nincline to steatopygia in later life, and this deposit of fat, together\r\nwith the tail of bast which they wore, gave them, as they walked,\r\nSchweinfurth says, the appearance of \"dancing baboons.\" The Bongo men\r\nformerly wore only a loin-cloth, and many dozen iron rings on the arms\r\n(arranged to form a sort of armour), while the women had simply a\r\ngirdle, to which was attached a tuft of grass. Both sexes now largely\r\nuse cotton cloths as dresses. The tribal ornaments consist of nails or\r\nplugs which are passed through the lower lip. The women often wear a\r\ndisk several inches in diameter in this fashion, together with a ring or\r\na bit of straw in the upper lip, straws in the _alae_ of the nostrils,\r\nand a ring in the _septum_. The Bongo, unlike other of the upper Nile\r\nNegroes, are not great cattle-breeders, but employ their time in\r\nagriculture. The crops mostly cultivated are sorghum, tobacco, sesame\r\nand durra. The Bongo eat the fruits, tubers and fungi in which the\r\ncountry is rich. They also eat almost every creature--bird, beast,\r\ninsect and reptile, with the exception of the dog. They despise no\r\nflesh, fresh or putrid. They drive the vulture from carrion, and eat\r\nwith relish the intestinal worms of the ox. Earth-eating, too, is\r\ncommon among them. They are particularly skilled in the smelting and\r\nworking of iron. Iron forms the currency of the country, and is\r\nextensively employed for all kinds of useful and ornamental purposes.\r\nBongo spears, knives, rings, and other articles are frequently fashioned\r\nwith great artistic elaboration. They have a variety of musical\r\ninstruments--drums, stringed instruments, and horns--in the practice of\r\nwhich they take great delight; and they indulge in a vocal recitative\r\nwhich seems intended to imitate a succession of natural sounds.\r\nSchweinfurth says that Bongo music is like the raging of the elements.\r\nMarriage is by purchase; and a man is allowed to acquire three wives,\r\nbut not more. Tattooing is partially practised. As regards burial, the\r\ncorpse is bound in a crouching position with the knees drawn up to the\r\nchin; men are placed in the grave with the face to the north, and women\r\nwith the face to the south. The form of the grave is peculiar,\r\nconsisting of a niche in a vertical shaft, recalling the mastaba graves\r\nof the ancient Egyptians. The tombs are frequently ornamented with rough\r\nwooden figures intended to represent the deceased. Of the immortality of\r\nthe soul they have no defined notion; and their only approach to a\r\nknowledge of a beneficent deity consists in a vague idea of luck. They\r\nhave, however, a most intense belief in a great variety of petty goblins\r\nand witches, which are essentially malignant. Arrows, spears and clubs\r\nform their weapons, the first two distinguished by a multiplicity of\r\nbarbs. Euphorbia juice is used as a poison for the arrows. Shields are\r\nrare. Their language is musical, and abounds in the vowels o and a; its\r\nvocabulary of concrete terms is very rich, but the same word has often a\r\ngreat variety of meanings. The grammatical structure is simple. As a\r\nrace the Bongo are gentle and industrious, and exhibit strong family\r\naffection.\r\n\r\n  See G.A. Schweinfurth, _The Heart of Africa_ (London, 1873); W.\r\n  Junker, _Travels in Africa_ (Eng. edit., London, 1890-1892).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONGO (_Boocercus eurycerus_), a West African bushbuck, the largest of\r\nthe group. The male is deep chestnut, marked on the body with narrow\r\nwhite stripes, on the chest with a white crescent, and on the face by\r\ntwo white spots below the eye. In the East African bongo (_B. e.\r\nIsaaei_) the body hue is stronger and richer. There is, as yet, no\r\nevidence as to whether the females of the true bongo bear horns, though\r\nit is probable they do; but as the horns are present in both sexes of\r\nthe East African form, Mr Oldfield Thomas has made that the type of the\r\ngenus.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] _Annals and Mag. Nat. Hist._ vol. x. (seventh series), p. 309.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONHAM, a town and the county-seat of Fannin county, Texas, U.S.A.,\r\nabout 14 m. S. of the Red river, in the north-east part of the state,\r\nand 70 m. N. of Dallas. Pop. (1890) 3361; (1900) 5042 (1223 being\r\nnegroes); (1910), 4844. It is served by the Missouri, Kansas & Texas,\r\nand the Texas & Pacific railways. Bonham is the seat of Carlton College\r\n(Christian), a woman's college founded in 1867; and its high school is\r\none of the best in the state. It is a trading and shipping centre of an\r\nextensive farming territory devoted to the raising of live-stock and to\r\nthe growing of cotton, Indian corn, fruit, &c. It has large cotton gins\r\nand compresses, a large cotton mill, flour mills, canning and ice\r\nfactories, railway repair shops, planing mills and carriage works. The\r\ntown was named in honour of J.B. Bonham, a native of South Carolina, who\r\nwas killed in the Alamo. The first settlement here was made in 1836. The\r\ntown was incorporated in 1850, and was re-incorporated in 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONHEUR [MARIE ROSALIE], ROSA (1822-1899), French painter, was born at\r\nBordeaux on the 22nd of March 1822. She was of Jewish origin. Jacques\r\nWiener, the Belgian medallist, a native of Venloo, says that he and\r\nRaymond Bonheur, Rosa's father, used to attend synagogue in that town;\r\nwhile another authority asserts that Rosa used to be known in common\r\nparlance by the name of Rosa Mazeltov (a Hebrew term for \"good luck,\"\r\n_Gallice_ Bonheur). She was the eldest of four children, all of whom\r\nwere artists--Auguste (1824-1884) painted animals and landscape;\r\nJuliette (1830-1891) was \"honourably mentioned\" at the exhibition of\r\n1855; Isidore, born in 1827, was a sculptor of animals. Rosa at an early\r\nage was taught to draw by her father (who died in 1849), and he,\r\nperceiving her very remarkable talent, permitted her to abandon the\r\nbusiness of dressmaking, to which, much against her will, she had been\r\nput, in order to devote herself wholly to art. From 1840 to 1845 she\r\nexhibited at the salon, and five times received a prize; in 1848 a medal\r\nwas awarded to her. Her fame dates more especially from the exhibition\r\nof 1855; from that time Rosa Bonheur's works were much sought after in\r\nEngland, where collectors and public galleries competed eagerly for\r\nthem. What is chiefly remarkable and admirable in her work is that, like\r\nher contemporary, Jacques Raymond Brascassat (1804-1867), she represents\r\nanimals as they really are, as she saw them in the country. Her gift of\r\naccurate observation was, however, allied to a certain dryness of style\r\nin painting; she often failed to give a perfect sense of atmosphere. On\r\nthe other hand, the anatomy of her animals is always faultlessly true.\r\nThere is nothing feminine in her handling; her treatment is always manly\r\nand firm. Of her many works we may note the following:--\"Ploughing in\r\nthe Nivernais\" (1848), in the Luxembourg gallery; \"The Horse Fair\"\r\n(1853), one of the two replicas of which is in the National Gallery,\r\nLondon, the original being in the United States; and \"Hay Harvest in\r\nAuvergne\" (1835). She was decorated with the Legion of Honour by the\r\nempress Eugenie, and was subsequently promoted to the rank of \"officer\"\r\nof the order. After 1867 Rosa Bonheur exhibited but once in the salon,\r\nin 1899, a few weeks before her death. She lived quietly at her country\r\nhouse at By, near Fontainebleau, where for some years she had held\r\ngratuitous classes for drawing. She left at her death a considerable\r\nnumber of pictures, studies, drawings and etchings, which were sold by\r\nauction in Paris in the spring of 1900.     (H. Fr.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONHEUR DU JOUR, the name for a lady's writing-desk, so called because,\r\nwhen it was introduced in France about 1760, it speedily became\r\nintensely fashionable. The bonheur du jour is always very light and\r\ngraceful; its special characteristic is a raised back, which may form a\r\nlittle cabinet or a nest of drawers, or may simply be fitted with a\r\nmirror. The top, often surrounded with a chased and gilded bronze\r\ngallery, serves for placing small ornaments. Beneath the writing surface\r\nthere is usually a single drawer. The details vary greatly, but the\r\ngeneral characteristics are always traceable. The bonheur du jour has\r\nnever been so delicate, so charming, so coquettish as in the quarter of\r\na century which followed its introduction. The choicer examples of the\r\ntime are inlaid with marqueterie, edged with exotic woods, set in gilded\r\nbronze, or enriched with panels of Oriental lacquer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONI (_Bone_), a vassal state of the government of Celebes, Dutch East\r\nIndies, in the south-west peninsula of Celebes, on the Gulf of Boni.\r\nArea, 2600 sq. m. It produces rice, tobacco, coffee, cotton and\r\nsugar-cane, none of them important as exports. The breeds of buffaloes\r\nand horses in this state are highly esteemed. The chief town, Boni, lies\r\n80 m. N.E. of Macassar, and 2-1/2 m. from the east coast of the peninsula.\r\nThe native race of Bugis (q.v.), whose number within this area is\r\nabout 70,000, is one of the most interesting in the whole archipelago.\r\n\r\nBoni was once the most powerful state of Celebes, all the other princes\r\nbeing regarded as vassals of its ruler, but its history is not known in\r\ndetail. In 1666 the rajah Palakkah, whose father and grandfather had\r\nbeen murdered by the family of Hassan, the tyrant of Sumatra, made\r\ncommon cause with the Dutch against that despot. From that date till the\r\nbeginning of the 19th century Dutch influence in the state remained\r\nundisputed. In 1814, however, Boni fell into the hands of the British,\r\nwho retained it for two years; but by the European treaties concluded on\r\nthe downfall of Napoleon it reverted to its original colonizers. Their\r\ninfluence, however, was resisted more than once by the natives. An\r\nexpedition in 1825, under General van Geen, was not fully successful in\r\nenforcing it; and in 1858 and the following year two expeditions were\r\nnecessary to oppose an attempt by the princess regent towards\r\nindependence. In 1860 a new prince, owning allegiance to the Dutch, was\r\nset up. As in other native states in Celebes, succession to the throne\r\nin the female line has precedence over the male line.\r\n\r\n  For the wars in Boni, see Perelaer, _De Bonische expeditien,\r\n  1859-1860_ (Leiden, 1872); and Meyers, in the _Militaire Spectator_\r\n  (1880).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONIFACE, SAINT (680-754), the apostle of Germany, whose real name was\r\nWynfrith, was born of a good Saxon family at Crediton or Kirton in\r\nDevonshire. While still young he became a monk, and studied grammar and\r\ntheology first at Exeter, then at Nutcell near Winchester, under the\r\nabbot Winberht. He soon distinguished himself both as scholar and\r\npreacher, and had every inducement to remain in his monastery, but in\r\n716 he followed the example of other Saxon monks and set out as\r\nmissionary to Frisia. He was soon obliged to return, however, probably\r\nowing to the hostility of Radbod, king of the Frisians, then at war with\r\nCharles Martel. At the end of 717 he went to Rome, where in 719 Pope\r\nGregory II. commissioned him to evangelize Germany and to counteract the\r\ninfluence of the Irish monks there. Crossing the Alps, Boniface visited\r\nBavaria and Thuringia, but upon hearing of the death of Radbod he\r\nhurried again to Frisia, where, under the direction of his countryman\r\nWillibrord (d. 738), the first bishop of Utrecht, he preached\r\nsuccessfully for three years. About 722 he visited Hesse and Thuringia,\r\nwon over some chieftains, and converted and baptized great numbers of\r\nthe heathen. Having sent special word to Gregory of his success, he was\r\nsummoned to Rome and consecrated bishop on the 30th of November 722,\r\nafter taking an oath of obedience to the pope. Then his mission was\r\nenlarged. He returned with letters of recommendation to Charles Martel,\r\ncharged not only to convert the heathen but to suppress heresy as well.\r\n\r\nCharles's protection, as he himself confessed, made possible his great\r\ncareer. Armed with it he passed safely into heathen Germany and began a\r\nsystematic crusade, baptizing, overturning idols, founding churches and\r\nmonasteries, and calling from England a band of missionary helpers,\r\nmonks and nuns, some of whom have become famous: St Lull, his successor\r\nin the see at Mainz; St Burchard, bishop of Wurzburg; St Gregory, abbot\r\nat Utrecht; Willibald, his biographer; St Lioba, St Walburge, St Thecla.\r\nIn 732 Boniface was created archbishop. In 738 for the third time he\r\nwent to Rome. On his return he organized the church in Bavaria into the\r\nfour bishoprics of Regensburg, Freising, Salzburg and Passau. Then his\r\npower was extended still further. In 741 Pope Zacharias made him legate,\r\nand charged him with the reformation of the whole Frankish church. With\r\nthe support of Carloman and Pippin, who had just succeeded Charles\r\nMartel as mayors of the palace, Boniface set to work. As he had done in\r\nBavaria, he organized the east Frankish church into four bishoprics,\r\nErfurt, Wurzburg, Buraburg and Eichstadt, and set over them his own\r\nmonks. In 742 he presided at what is generally counted as the first\r\nGerman council. At the same period he founded the abbey of Fulda, as a\r\ncentre for German monastic culture, placing it under the Bavarian Sturm,\r\nwhose biography gives us so many picturesque glimpses of the time, and\r\nmaking its rule stricter than the Benedictine. Then came a theological\r\nand disciplinary controversy with Virgil, the Irish bishop of Salzburg,\r\nwho held, among other heresies, that there were other worlds than ours.\r\nVirgil must have been a most remarkable man; in spite of his leanings\r\ntoward science he held his own against Boniface, and was canonized after\r\nhis death. Boniface was more successful in France. There a certain\r\nAdalbert or Aldebert, a Frankish bishop of Neustria, had caused great\r\ndisturbance. He had been performing miracles, and claimed to have\r\nreceived his relics, not from Rome like those of Boniface, but directly\r\nfrom the angels. Planting crosses in the open fields he drew the people\r\nto desert the churches, and had won a great following throughout all\r\nNeustria. Opinions are divided as to whether he was a Culdee, a\r\nrepresentative of a national Frankish movement, or simply the charlatan\r\nthat Boniface paints him. At the instance of Pippin, Boniface secured\r\nAdalbert's condemnation at the synod of Soissons in 744; but he, and\r\nClement, a Scottish missionary and a heretic on predestination,\r\ncontinued to find followers in spite of legate, council and pope, for\r\nthree or four years more.\r\n\r\nBetween 746 and 748 Boniface was made bishop of Mainz, and became\r\nmetropolitan over the Rhine bishoprics and Utrecht, as well as over\r\nthose he had established in Germany--thus founding the pre-eminence of\r\nthe see of Mainz. In 747 a synod of the Frankish bishops sent to Rome a\r\nformal statement of their submission to the papal authority. The\r\nsignificance of this act can only be realized when one recalls the\r\ntendencies toward the formation of national churches, which had been so\r\npowerful under the Merovingians. Boniface does not seem to have taken\r\npart in the anointing of Pippin as king of the Franks in 752. In 754 he\r\nresigned his archbishopric in favour of Lull, and took up again his\r\nearliest plan of a mission to Frisia; but on the 5th of June 754 he and\r\nhis companions were massacred by the heathen near Dockum. His remains\r\nwere afterwards taken to Fulda.\r\n\r\nSt Boniface has well been called the proconsul of the papacy. His\r\norganizing genius, even more than his missionary zeal, left its mark\r\nupon the German church throughout all the middle ages. The missionary\r\nmovement which until his day had been almost independent of control,\r\nlargely carried on by schismatic Irish monks, was brought under the\r\ndirection of Rome. But in so welding together the scattered centres and\r\nbinding them to the papacy, Boniface seems to have been actuated by\r\nsimple zeal for unity of the faith, and not by a conscious political\r\nmotive.\r\n\r\nThough pre-eminently a man of action, Boniface has left several literary\r\nremains. We have above all his Letters (_Epistolae_), difficult to date,\r\nbut extremely important from the standpoint of history, dogma, or\r\nliterature; see Dummler's edition in the _Monumenta Germaniae\r\nhistorica_, 1892. Besides these there are a grammar (_De octo partibus\r\norationibus_, ed. Mai, in _Classici Auctores_, t. vii.), some sermons of\r\ncontested authenticity, some poems (_Aenigmata_, ed. Dummler, _Poetae\r\nlatini aevi Carolini_, i. 1881), a penitential, and some _Dicta\r\nBonifacii_ (ed. Nurnberger in _Theologische Quartalschrift_, Tubingen,\r\nvol. 70, 1888), the authenticity of which it is hard to prove or to\r\nrefute. Migne in his _Patrologia Latina_ (vol. 89) has reproduced the\r\nedition of Boniface's works by Giles (London, 1844).\r\n\r\n  There are very many monographs on Boniface and on different phases of\r\n  his life (see Potthast, _Bibliotheca medii aevi_, and Ulysse\r\n  Chevalier's _Bibliographie_, 2nd ed. for indications), but none that\r\n  is completely satisfactory. Among recent studies are those of B.\r\n  Kuhlmann, _Der heilige Bonifatius, Apostel der Deutschen_ (Paderborn,\r\n  1895), and of G. Kurth, _Saint Boniface_ (2nd ed., 1902). W. Levison\r\n  has edited the _Vitae sancti Bonifatii_ (Hanover, 1905).\r\n       (J. T. S.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONIFACE (_Bonifacius_), the name of nine of the popes.\r\n\r\nBONIFACE I., bishop of Rome from 418 to 422. At the death of Pope\r\nZosimus, the Roman clergy were divided into two factions, one of which\r\nelected the deacon Eulalius, and the other the priest Boniface. The\r\nimperial government, in the interests of public order, commanded the two\r\ncompetitors to leave the town, reserving the decision of the case to a\r\ncouncil. Eulalius having broken his ban, the emperor Honorius decided to\r\nrecognize Boniface, and the council was countermanded. But the faction\r\nof Eulalius long continued to foment disorders, and the secular\r\nauthority was compelled to intervene.\r\n\r\nBONIFACE II., pope from 530 to 532, was by birth a Goth, and owed his\r\nelection to the nomination of his predecessor, Felix IV., and to the\r\ninfluence of the Gothic king. The Roman electors had opposed to him a\r\npriest of Alexandria called Dioscorus, who died a month after his\r\nelection, and thus left the position open for him. Boniface endeavoured\r\nto nominate his own successor, thus transforming into law, or at least\r\ninto custom, the proceeding by which he had benefited; but the clergy\r\nand the senate of Rome forced him to cancel this arrangement.\r\n\r\nBONIFACE III. was pope from the 15th of February to the 12th of November\r\n606. He obtained from Phocas recognition of the \"headship of the church\r\nat Rome,\" which signifies, no doubt, that Phocas compelled the patriarch\r\nof Constantinople to abandon (momentarily) his claim to the title of\r\noecumenical patriarch.\r\n\r\nBONIFACE IV. was pope from 608 to 615. He received from the emperor\r\nPhocas the Pantheon at Rome, which was converted into a Christian\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nBONIFACE V., pope from 619 to 625, did much for the christianizing of\r\nEngland. Bede mentions (_Hist. Eccl._) that he wrote encouraging letters\r\nto Mellitus, archbishop of Canterbury, and Justus, bishop of Rochester,\r\nand quotes three letters--to Justus, to Eadwin, king of Northumbria, and\r\nto his wife Aethelberga. William of Malmesbury gives a letter to Justus\r\nof the year 625, in which Canterbury is constituted the metropolitan see\r\nof Britain for ever.\r\n\r\nBONIFACE VI. was elected pope in April 896, and died fifteen days\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nBONIFACE VII. was pope from August 984 to July 985. His family name was\r\nFranco. In 974 he was substituted by Crescentius and the Roman barons\r\nfor Benedict VI., who had been assassinated. He was ejected by Count\r\nSicco, the representative of the emperor Otto II., and fled to\r\nConstantinople. On the death of Otto (983) he returned, seized Pope John\r\nXIV., threw him into prison, and installed himself in his place.\r\n     (L. D.*)\r\n\r\nBONIFACE VIII. (Benedetto Gaetano), pope from 1294 to 1303, was born of\r\nnoble family at Anagni, studied canon and civil law in Italy and\r\npossibly at Paris. After being appointed to canonicates at Todi (June\r\n1260) and in France, he became an advocate and then a notary at the\r\npapal court. With Cardinal Ottoboni, who was to aid the English king,\r\nHenry III., against the bishops of the baronial party, he was besieged\r\nin the Tower of London by the rebellious earl of Gloucester, but was\r\nrescued by the future Edward I., on the 27th of April 1267. Created\r\ncardinal deacon in 1281, and in 1291 cardinal priest (SS. Sylvestri et\r\nMartini), he was entrusted with many diplomatic missions and became very\r\ninfluential in the Sacred College. He helped the ineffective Celestine\r\nV. to abdicate, and was himself chosen pope at Naples on the 24th of\r\nDecember 1294. Contrary to custom, the election was not made unanimous,\r\nprobably because of the hostility of certain French cardinals. Celestine\r\nattempted to rule in extreme monastic poverty and humility; not so\r\nBoniface, who ardently asserted the lordship of the papacy over all the\r\nkingdoms of the world. He was crowned at Rome in January 1295 with great\r\npomp. He planned to pacify the West and then recover the Holy Land from\r\nthe infidel; but during his nine years' reign, so far from being a\r\npeacemaker, he involved the papacy itself in a series of controversies\r\nwith leading European powers. Avarice, lofty claims and frequent\r\nexhibitions of arrogance made him many foes. The policy of supporting\r\nthe interests of the house of Anjou in Sicily proved a grand failure.\r\nThe attempt to build up great estates for his family made most of the\r\nColonna his enemies. Until 1303 he refused to recognize Albert of\r\nAustria as the rightful German king. Assuming that he was overlord of\r\nHungary, he declared that its crown should fall to the house of Anjou.\r\nHe humbled Eric VI. of Denmark, but was unsuccessful in the attempt to\r\ntry Edward I., the conqueror of Scotland, on the charge of interfering\r\nwith a papal fief; for parliament declared in 1301 that Scotland had\r\nnever been a fief of Rome. The most noted conflict of Boniface was that\r\nwith Philip IV. of France. In 1296, by the bull _Clericis laicos_, the\r\npope forbade the levying of taxes, however disguised, on the clergy\r\nwithout his consent. Forced to recede from this position, Boniface\r\ncanonized Louis IX. (1297). The hostilities were later renewed; in 1302\r\nBoniface himself drafted and published the indubitably genuine bull\r\n_Unam sanctam_, one of the strongest official statements of the papal\r\nprerogative ever made. The weight of opinion now tends to deny that any\r\npart of this much-discussed document save the last sentence bears the\r\nmarks of an infallible utterance. The French vice-chancellor Guillaume\r\nde Nogaret was sent to arrest the pope, against whom grave charges had\r\nbeen brought, and bring him to France to be deposed by an oecumenical\r\ncouncil. The accusation of heresy has usually been dismissed as a\r\nslander; but recent investigations make it probable, though not quite\r\ncertain, that Boniface privately held certain Averroistic tenets, such\r\nas the denial of the immortality of the soul. With Sciarra Colonna,\r\nNogaret surprised Boniface at Anagni, on the 7th of September 1303, as\r\nthe latter was about to pronounce the sentence of excommunication\r\nagainst the king. After a nine-hours' truce the palace was stormed, and\r\nBoniface was found lying in his bed, a cross clasped to his breast; that\r\nhe was sitting in full regalia on the papal throne is a legend. Nogaret\r\nclaimed that he saved the pope's life from the vengeful Colonna.\r\nThreatened, but not maltreated, the pope had remained three days under\r\narrest when the citizens of Anagni freed him. He was conducted to Rome,\r\nonly to be confined in the Vatican by the Orsini. He died on the 11th or\r\n12th of October 1303, not eighty-six years old, as has commonly been\r\nbelieved, but perhaps under seventy, at all events not over\r\nseventy-five. \"He shall come in like a fox, reign like a lion, die like\r\na dog,\" is a gibe wrongly held to be a prophecy of his unfortunate\r\npredecessor. Dante, who had become embittered against Boniface while on\r\na political mission in Rome, calls him the \"Prince of the new Pharisees\"\r\n(_Inferno_, 27, 85), but laments that \"in his Vicar Christ was made a\r\ncaptive,\" and was \"mocked a second time\" (_Purgatory_, 20, 87 f.).\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Digard, Faucon and Thomas, _Les Registres de Boniface\r\n  VIII_ (Paris, 1884 ff.); Wetzer and Welte, _Kirchenlexikon_, vol. ii.\r\n  (2nd ed., Freiburg, 1883), 1037-1062; Herzog-Hauck,\r\n  _Realencyklopadie_, vol. iii.

(Piero Tomacelli), pope from 1389 to 1404, was born at\r\nNaples of a poor but ancient family. Created cardinal by Urban VI., he\r\nwas elected successor to the latter on the 2nd of November 1389. In 1391\r\nhe canonized Birgitta of Sweden. He was able to restore Roman authority\r\nin the major part of the papal states, and in 1398 put an end to the\r\nrepublican liberties of the city itself. Boniface won Naples, which had\r\nowed spiritual allegiance to the antipopes Clement VII. and Benedict\r\nXIII. of Avignon, to the Roman obedience. In 1403 he ventured at last to\r\nconfirm the deposition of the emperor Wenceslaus and the election of\r\nRupert. Negotiations for the healing of the Great Schism were without\r\nresult. In spite of his inferior education, the contemporaries of\r\nBoniface trusted his prudence and moral character; yet when in financial\r\nstraits he sold offices, and in 1399 transformed the annates into a\r\npermanent tax. In 1390 he celebrated the regular jubilee, but a rather\r\ninformal one held in 1400 proved more profitable. Though probably not\r\npersonally avaricious, he was justly accused of nepotism. He died on the\r\n1st of October 1404, being still under sixty years of age.\r\n     (W. W. R.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONIFACE OF SAVOY (d. 1270), archbishop of Canterbury, became primate in\r\n1243, through the favour of Henry III., of whose queen, Eleanor of\r\nProvence, he was an uncle. Boniface, though a man of violent temper and\r\ntoo often absent from his see, showed some sympathy with the reforming\r\nparty in the English church. Though in 1250 he provoked the English\r\nbishops by claiming the right of visitation in their dioceses, he took\r\nthe lead at the council of Merton (1258) in vindicating the privileges\r\nof his order. In the barons' war he took the royalist side, but did not\r\ndistinguish himself by great activity.\r\n\r\n  See Matthew Paris, _Chronica Majora_; Francois Mugnier, _Les Savoyards\r\n  en Angleterre_ (Chambery, 1890).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONIFACIO, a maritime town at the southern extremity of Corsica, in the\r\narrondissement of Sartene, 87 m. S.S.E. of Ajaccio by road. Pop. (1906)\r\n2940. Bonifacio, which overlooks the straits of that name separating\r\nCorsica from Sardinia, occupies a remarkable situation on the summit of\r\na peninsula of white calcareous rock, extending parallel to the coast\r\nand enclosing a narrow and secure harbour. Below the town and in the\r\ncliffs facing it the rock is hollowed into caverns accessible only by\r\nboat. St Dominic, a church built in the 13th century by the Templars,\r\nand the cathedral of Santa Maria Maggiore which belongs mainly to the\r\n12th century, are the chief buildings. The fortifications and citadel\r\ndate from the 16th and 17th centuries. A massive medieval tower serves\r\nas a powder-magazine. The trade of Bonifacio, which is carried on\r\nchiefly with Sardinia, is in cereals, wine, cork and olive-oil of fine\r\nquality. Cork-cutting, tobacco-manufacture and coral-fishing are carried\r\non. The olive is largely cultivated in the neighbourhood and there are\r\noil-works in the town.\r\n\r\nBonifacio was founded about 828 by the Tuscan marquis whose name it\r\nbears, as a defence against the Saracen pirates. At the end of the 11th\r\ncentury it became subject to Pisa, and at the end of the 12th was taken\r\nand colonized by the Genoese, whose influence may be traced in the\r\ncharacter of the population. In 1420 it heroically withstood a\r\nprotracted siege by Alphonso V. of Aragon. In 1554 it fell into the\r\nhands of the Franco-Turkish army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONIFACIUS (d. 432), the Roman governor of the province of Africa who is\r\ngenerally believed to have invited the Vandals into that province in\r\nrevenge for the hostile action of Placidia, ruling in behalf of her son\r\nthe emperor Valentinian III. (428-429). That action is by Procopius\r\nattributed to his rival Aetius, but the earliest authorities speak of a\r\ncertain Felix, chief minister of Placidia, as the calumniator of\r\nBonifacius. Whether he really invited the Vandals or not, there is no\r\ndoubt that he soon turned against them and bravely defended the city of\r\nHippo from their attacks. In 432 he returned to Italy, was received into\r\nfavour by Placidia, and appointed master of the soldiery. Aetius,\r\nhowever, resented his promotion, the two rivals met, perhaps in single\r\ncombat, and Bonifacius, though victorious, received a wound from the\r\neffects of which he died three months later.\r\n\r\n  The authorities for the extremely obscure and difficult history of\r\n  these transactions are well discussed by E.A. Freeman in an article in\r\n  the _English Historical Review_, July 1887, to which the reader is\r\n  referred. But compare also Gibbon, _Decline and Fall of the Roman\r\n  Empire_, vol. iii. pp. 505-506, edited by J.B. Bury (London, 1897).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONIN ISLANDS, called by the Japanese OGASAWARA-JIMA, a chain of small\r\nislands belonging to Japan, stretching nearly due north and south, a\r\nlittle east of 142 E., and from 26 deg. 35' to 27 deg. 45' N., about 500\r\nm. from the mainland of Japan. They number twenty, according to Japanese\r\ninvestigations, and have a coast-line of 174.65 m. and a superficies of\r\n28.82 sq. m. Only ten of them have any appreciable size, and these are\r\nnamed--commencing from the north--Muko-shima (Bridegroom Island),\r\nNakadachi-shima (Go-between Island[1]), Yome-shima (Bride Island),\r\nOtoto-jima (Younger-brother Island), Ani-shima (Elder-brother Island),\r\nChichi-jima (Father Island), Haha-jima (Mother Island), Mei-jima (Niece\r\nIsland), Ani-jima (Elder-sister Island) and Imoto-jima (Younger-sister\r\nIsland). European geographers have been accustomed to divide the islands\r\ninto three groups for purposes of nomenclature, calling the northern\r\ngroup the Parry Islands, the central the Beechey Islands and the\r\nsouthern the Coffin or Bailey Islands. The second largest of all,\r\nChichi-jima, in Japanese cartography was called Peel Island in 1827 by\r\nCaptain Beechey, and the same officer gave the name of Stapleton Island\r\nto the Ototo-jima of the Japanese, and that of Buckland Island to their\r\nAni-jima. To complete this account of Captain Beechey's nomenclature, it\r\nmay be added that he called a large bay on the south of Peel Island\r\nFitton Bay, and a bay on the south-west of Buckland Island Walker\r\nBay.[2] Port Lloyd, the chief anchorage (situated on Peel Island), is\r\nconsidered by Commodore Perry--who visited the islands in 1853 and\r\nstrongly urged the establishment of a United States coaling station\r\nthere--to have been formerly the crater of a volcano from which the\r\nsurrounding hills were thrown up, the entrance to the harbour being a\r\nfissure through which lava used to pour into the sea. The islands are,\r\nindeed, plainly volcanic in their nature.\r\n\r\n_History._--The diversity of nomenclature indicated above suggests that\r\nthe ownership of the islands was for some time doubtful. According to\r\nJapanese annals they were discovered towards the close of the 16th\r\ncentury, and added to the fief of a Daimyo, Ogasawa Sadayori, whence the\r\nname Ogasawara-jima. They were also called _Bunin-jima_ (corrupted by\r\nforeigners into Bonin) because of their being without (_bu_) inhabitants\r\n(_nin_). Effective occupation did not take place, however, and\r\ncommunications with the islands ceased altogether in 1635, as was a\r\nnatural consequence of the Japanese government's veto against the\r\nconstruction of sea-going vessels. In 1728 fitful communication was\r\nrestored by the then representative of the Ogasawara family, only to be\r\nagain interrupted until 1861, when an unsuccessful attempt was made to\r\nestablish a Japanese colony at Port Lloyd. Meanwhile, Captain Beechey\r\nvisited the islands in the \"Blossom,\" assigned names to some of them,\r\nand published a description of their features. Next a small party\r\nconsisting of two British subjects, two American citizens, and a Dane,\r\nsailed from the Sandwich Islands for Port Lloyd in 1830, taking with\r\nthem some Hawaiian natives. These colonists hoisted the British flag on\r\nPeel Island (Chichi-jima), and settled there. When Commodore Perry\r\narrived in 1853, there were on Peel Island thirty-one inhabitants, four\r\nbeing English, four American, one Portuguese and the rest natives of the\r\nSandwich Islands, the Ladrones, &c.; and when Mr Russell Robertson\r\nvisited the place in 1875, the colony had grown to sixty-nine, of whom\r\nonly five were pure whites. Mr Robertson found them without education,\r\nwithout religion, without laws and without any system of government, but\r\nliving comfortably on clearings of cultivated land. English was the\r\nlanguage of the settlers, and they regarded themselves as a British\r\ncolony. But in 1861 the British government renounced all claim to the\r\nislands in recognition of Japan's right of possession. There is now\r\nregular steam communication; the affairs of the islands are duly\r\nadministered, and the population has grown to about 4500. There are no\r\nmountains of any considerable height in the Ogasawara Islands, but the\r\nscenery is hilly with occasional bold crags. The vegetation is almost\r\ntropically luxuriant--palms, wild pineapples, and ferns growing\r\nprofusely, and the valleys being filled with wild beans and patches of\r\ntaro. Mr Robertson catalogues a number of valuable timbers that are\r\nobtained there, among them being Tremana, cedar, rose-wood, iron-wood\r\n(red and white), box-wood, sandal and white oak. The kekop tree, the\r\norange, the laurel, the juniper, the wild cactus, the curry plant, wild\r\nsage and celery flourish. No minerals have been discovered. The shores\r\nare covered with coral; earthquakes and tidal waves are frequent, the\r\nlatter not taking the form of bores, but of a sudden steady rise and\r\nequally sudden fall in the level of the sea; the climate is rather\r\ntropical than temperate, but sickness is almost unknown among the\r\nresidents.

Having studied at Leipzig under G.\r\nHermann and at Berlin under Bockh and Lachmann, he became successively\r\nteacher at the Blochmann institute in Dresden (1836), Oberlehrer at the\r\nFriedrich-Wilhelms gymnasium (1838) and the Graues Kloster (1840) in\r\nBerlin, professor at the gymnasium at Stettin (1842), professor at the\r\nuniversity of Vienna (1849), member of the imperial academy (1854),\r\nmember of the council of education (1864), and director of the Graues\r\nKloster gymnasium (1867). He retired in 1888, and died on the 25th of\r\nJuly in that year at Berlin. He took great interest in higher education,\r\nand was chiefly responsible for the system of teaching and examination\r\nin use in the high schools of Prussia after 1882. But it is as a\r\ncommentator on Plato and Aristotle that he is best known outside\r\nGermany. His most important works in this connexion are: _Disputationes\r\nPlatonicae Duae_ (1837); _Platonische Studien_ (3rd ed., 1886);\r\n_Observations Criticae in Aristotelis Libros Metaphysicos_ (1842);\r\n_Observationes Criticae in Aristotelis quae feruntur Magna Moralia et\r\nEthica Eudemia_ (1844); _Alexandri Aphrodisiensis Commentarius in Libras\r\nMetaphysicos Aristotelis_ (1847); _Aristotelis Metaphysica_ (1848-1849);\r\n_Uber die Kategorien des A._ (1853); _Aristotelische Studien_\r\n(1862-1867); _Index Aristotelicus_ (1870). Other works: _Uber den\r\nUrsprung der homerischen Gedichte_ (5th ed., 1881); _Beitrage zur\r\nErklarung des Thukydides_ (1854), _des Sophokles_ (1856-1857). He also\r\nwrote largely on classical and educational subjects, mainly for the\r\n_Zeitschrift fur die osterreichischen Gymnasien_.\r\n\r\n  A full list of his writings is given in the obituary notice by T.\r\n  Gompertz in the _Biographisches Jahrbuch fur Altertumskunde_ (1890).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONIVARD, FRANCOIS (1493-1570), the hero of Byron's poem, _The Prisoner\r\nof Chillon_, was born at Seyssel of an old Savoyard family. Bonivard has\r\nbeen described as \"a man of the Renaissance who had strayed into the age\r\nof the Reformation.\" His real character and history are, however, widely\r\ndifferent from the legendary account which was popularized by Byron. In\r\n1510 he succeeded his uncle, who had educated him, as prior of the\r\nCluniac priory of St Victor, close to Geneva. He naturally, therefore,\r\nopposed the attempts of the duke of Savoy, aided by his relative, the\r\nbishop of the city, to maintain his rights as lord of Geneva. He was\r\nimprisoned by the duke at Gex from 1519 to 1521, lost his priory, and\r\nbecame more and more anti-Savoyard. In 1530 he was again seized by the\r\nduke and imprisoned for four years underground, in the castle of\r\nChillon, till he was released in 1536 by the Bernese, who then wrested\r\nVaud from the duke. He had been imprisoned for political reasons, for he\r\ndid not become a Protestant till after his release, and then found that\r\nhis priory had been destroyed in 1534. He obtained a pension from\r\nGeneva, and was four times married, but owing to his extravagances was\r\nalways in debt. He was officially entrusted in 1542 with the task of\r\ncompiling a history of Geneva from the earliest times. In 1551 his MS.\r\nof the _Chroniques de Geneve_ (ending in 1530) was submitted to Calvin\r\nfor correction, but it was not published till 1831. The best edition is\r\nthat of 1867. The work is uncritical and partial, but is his best title\r\nto fame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONN, a town of Germany, in the Prussian Rhine province, on the left\r\nbank of the Rhine, 15 m. S. by E. from Cologne, on the main line of\r\nrailway to Mainz, and at the junction of the lines to the Eifel and (by\r\nferry) to the right bank of the Rhine. Pop. (1885) 35,989; (1905)\r\n81,997. The river is here crossed by a fine bridge (1896-1898), 1417 ft.\r\nin length, flanked by an embankment 2 m. long, above and parallel with\r\nwhich is the Coblenzer-strasse, with beautiful villas and pretty gardens\r\nreaching down to the Rhine. The central part of the town is composed of\r\nnarrow streets, but the outskirts contain numerous fine buildings, and\r\nthe appearance of the town from the river is attractive. There are six\r\nRoman Catholic and two Protestant churches, the most important of which\r\nis the Munster (minster), an imposing edifice of grey stone, in the\r\nRomanesque and Transition styles, surmounted by five towers, of which\r\nthe central, rising to a height of 315 ft., is a landmark in the Rhine\r\nvalley. The church dates from the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries, was\r\nrestored in 1875 and following years and in 1890-1894 was adorned with\r\npaintings. Among other churches are the Stiftskirche (monasterial\r\nchurch), rebuilt 1879-1884; the Jesuitenkirche (1693); the\r\nMinoritenkirche (1278-1318), the Herz Jesu-kirche (1862) and the\r\nMarienkirche (1892). There is also a synagogue, and the university\r\nchapel serves as an English church. The town also possesses a town hall\r\nsituate on the market square and dating from 1737, a fine block of\r\nlaw-court buildings, several high-grade schools and a theatre.\r\n\r\nBy far the finest of the buildings, however, is the famous university,\r\nwhich occupies the larger part of the southern frontage of the town. The\r\npresent establishment only dates from 1818, and owes its existence to\r\nKing Frederick William III. of Prussia; but as early as 1786 the academy\r\nwhich had been founded about nine years before was raised by Archbishop\r\nMaximilian Frederick of Cologne to the rank of a university, and\r\ncontinued to exercise its functions till 1794, when it was dissolved by\r\nthe last elector. The building now occupied by the university was\r\noriginally the electoral palace, constructed about 1717 out of the\r\nmaterials of the old fortifications. It was remodelled after the town\r\ncame into Prussian possession. There are five faculties in the\r\nuniversity--a legal, a medical, and a philosophic, and one of Roman\r\nCatholic and another Protestant theology. The library numbers upwards of\r\n230,000 volumes; and the antiquarian museum contains a valuable\r\ncollection of Roman relics discovered in the neighbourhood. Connected\r\nwith the university are also physiological, pathological and chemical\r\ninstitutes, five clinical departments and a laboratory. An academy of\r\nagriculture, with a natural history museum and botanic garden attached,\r\nis established in the palace of Clemensruhe at Poppelsdorf, which is\r\nreached by a fine avenue about a mile long, bordered on both sides by a\r\ndouble row of chestnut trees. A splendid observatory, long under the\r\ncharge of Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander, stands on the south side of the\r\nroad. The Roman Catholic archiepiscopal theological college, beautifully\r\nsituated on an eminence overlooking the Rhine, dates from 1892.\r\n\r\nBeethoven was born in Bonn, and a statue was erected to him in the\r\nMunster-platz in 1845. B.G. Niebuhr is buried in the cemetery outside of\r\nthe Sterntor, where a monument was placed to his memory by Frederick\r\nWilliam IV. Here are also the tombs of A.W. von Schlegel, the\r\ndiplomatist Christian Karl von Bunsen, Robert Schumann, Karl Simrock,\r\nE.M. Arndt and Schiller's wife. The town is adorned with a marble\r\nmonument commemorating the war of 1870-71, a handsome fountain, and a\r\nstatue of the Old Catholic bishop Reinkens. In 1889 a museum of\r\nBeethoven relics was opened in the house in which the composer was born.\r\nThere are further a municipal museum, arranged in a private house since\r\n1882, an academic art museum (1884), with some classic originals, a\r\ncreation of F.G. Welcker, and the provincial museum, standing near the\r\nrailway station, which contains a collection of medieval stone monuments\r\nand works of art, besides a small picture gallery.\r\n\r\nOne of the most conspicuous features of Bonn, viewed from the river, is\r\nthe pilgrimage (monastic) church of Kreuzberg (1627), behind and above\r\nPoppelsdorf; it has a flight of 28 steps, which pilgrims used to ascend\r\non their knees. \"Der alte Zoll,\" commanding a magnificent view of the\r\nSiebengebirge, is the only remaining bulwark of the old fortifications,\r\nthe Sterntor having been removed in order to open up better\r\ncommunication with the rapidly increasing western suburbs and the\r\nterminus of the light railway to Cologne.\r\n\r\nBut for its university Bonn would be a place of comparatively little\r\nimportance, its trade and commerce being of moderate dimensions. Its\r\nprincipal industries are jute spinning and weaving, and the manufacture\r\nof porcelain, flags, machinery and beer, and it has some trade in wine.\r\nThere are considerable numbers of foreign residents, notably English,\r\nattracted by the natural beauty of the place and by the educational\r\nfacilities it affords.\r\n\r\nBonn (_Bonna_ or _Castra Bonnensia_), originally a town of the Ubii,\r\nbecame at an early period the site of a Roman military settlement, and\r\nas such is frequently mentioned by Tacitus. It was the scene, in A.D.\r\n70, of a battle in which the Romans were defeated by Claudius Civilis,\r\nthe valiant leader of the Batavians. Greatly reduced by successive\r\nbarbarian inroads, it was restored about 359 by the emperor Julian. In\r\nthe centuries that followed the break-up of the Roman empire it again\r\nsuffered much from barbarian attacks, and was finally devastated in 889\r\nby bands of Norse raiders who had sailed up the Rhine. It was again\r\nfortified by Konrad von Hochstaden, archbishop of Cologne (1238-1261),\r\nwhose successor, Engelbert von Falkenburg (d. 1274), driven out of his\r\ncathedral city by the townspeople, established himself here (1265); from\r\nwhich time until 1794 it remained the residence of the electors of\r\nCologne. During the various wars that devastated Germany in the 16th,\r\n17th and 18th centuries, the town was frequently besieged and occupied\r\nby the several belligerents, but continued to belong to the electors\r\ntill 1794, when the French took possession of it. At the peace of\r\nLuneville they were formally recognized in their occupation; but in 1815\r\nthe town was made over by the congress of Vienna to Prussia. The\r\nfortifications had been dismantled in 1717.\r\n\r\n  See F. Ritter, _Entstehung der drei altesten Stadte am Rhein: Koln,\r\n  Bonn und Mainz_ (Bonn, 1851); H. von Sybel, _Die Grundung der\r\n  Universitat Bonn_ (1868); and _Fuhrer von Hesse_ (10th ed., 1901).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONNAT, LEON JOSEPH FLORENTIN (1833- ), French painter, was born at\r\nBayonne on the 20th of June 1833. He was educated in Spain, under\r\nMadrazo at Madrid, and his long series of portraits shows the influence\r\nof Velasquez and the Spanish realists. In 1869 he won a medal of honour\r\nat Paris, where he became one of the leading artists of his day, and in\r\n1888 he became professor of painting at the Ecole des Beaux Arts. In May\r\n1905 he succeeded Paul Dubois as director. His vivid portrait-painting\r\nis his most characteristic work, but his subject pictures, such as the\r\n\"Martyrdom of St Denis\" in the Pantheon, are also famous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONNE-CARRERE, GUILLAUME DE (1754-1825), French diplomatist, was born at\r\nMuret in Languedoc on the 13th of February 1754. He began his career in\r\nthe army, but soon entered the diplomatic service under Vergennes. A\r\nfriend of Mirabeau and of Dumouriez, he became very active at the\r\nRevolution, and Dumouriez re-established for him the title of\r\ndirector-general of the department of foreign affairs (March 1792). He\r\nremained at the ministry, preserving the habits of the diplomacy of the\r\nold regime, until December 1792, when he was sent to Belgium as agent of\r\nthe republic, but he was involved in the treason of Dumouriez and was\r\narrested on the 2nd of April 1793. To justify himself, he published an\r\naccount of his conduct from the beginning of the Revolution. He was\r\nfreed from prison in July 1794. Napoleon did not trust him, and gave him\r\nonly some unimportant missions. After 1815 Bonne-Carrere retired into\r\nprivate life, directing a profitable business in public carriages\r\nbetween Paris and Versailles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONNER, EDMUND (1500?-1569), bishop of London, was perhaps the natural\r\nson of George Savage, rector of Davenham, Cheshire, by Elizabeth\r\nFrodsham, who was afterwards married to Edmund Bonner, a sawyer of\r\nHanley in Worcestershire. This account, which was printed with many\r\ncircumstantial details by Strype (_Eccles. Mem._ III. i. 172-173), was\r\ndisputed by Strype's contemporary, Sir Edmund Lechmere, who asserted on\r\nnot very satisfactory evidence (_ib. Annals_, I. ii. 300)that Bonner was\r\nof legitimate birth. He was educated at Broadgates Hall, now Pembroke\r\nCollege, Oxford, graduating bachelor of civil and canon law in June\r\n1519. He was ordained about the same time, and admitted D.C.L. in 1525.\r\nIn 1529 he was Wolsey's chaplain, and he was with the cardinal at Cawood\r\nat the time of his arrest. Subsequently he was transferred, perhaps\r\nthrough Cromwell's influence, to the service of the king, and in January\r\n1532 he was sent to Rome to obstruct the judicial proceedings against\r\nHenry in the papal curia. In October 1533 he was entrusted with the\r\nunmannerly task of intimating to Clement VII., while he was the guest of\r\nFrancis I. at Marseilles, Henry's appeal from the pope to a general\r\ncouncil; but there seems to be no good authority for Burnet's story that\r\nClement threatened to have him burnt alive. For these and other services\r\nBonner had been rewarded by the grant of several livings, and in 1535 he\r\nwas made archdeacon of Leicester.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of that year he was sent to further what he called \"the\r\ncause of the Gospel\" (_Letters and Papers_, 1536, No. 469) in North\r\nGermany; and in 1536 he wrote a preface to Gardiner's _De vera\r\nObedientia_, which asserted the royal, denied the papal, supremacy, and\r\nwas received with delight by the Lutherans. After a brief embassy to the\r\nemperor in the spring of 1538, Bonner superseded Gardiner at Paris, and\r\nbegan his mission by sending Cromwell a long list of accusations against\r\nhis predecessor (_ib_. 1538, ii. 144). He was almost as bitter against\r\nWyatt and Mason, whom he denounced as a \"papist,\" and the violence of\r\nhis conduct led Francis I. to threaten him with a hundred strokes of the\r\nhalberd. He seems, however, to have pleased his patron, Cromwell, and\r\nperhaps Henry, by his energy in seeing the king's \"Great\" Bible in\r\nEnglish through the press in Paris. He was already king's chaplain; his\r\nappointment at Paris had been accompanied by promotion to the see of\r\nHereford, and before he returned to take possession he was translated to\r\nthe bishopric of London (October 1539).\r\n\r\nHitherto Bonner had been known as a somewhat coarse and unscrupulous\r\ntool of Cromwell, a sort of ecclesiastical Wriothesley, He is not known\r\nto have protested against any of the changes effected by his masters; he\r\nprofessed to be no theologian, and was wont, when asked theological\r\nquestions, to refer his interrogators to the divines. He had graduated\r\nin law, and not in theology. There was nothing in the Reformation to\r\nappeal to him, except the repudiation of papal control; and he was one\r\nof those numerous Englishmen whose views were faithfully reflected in\r\nthe Six Articles. He became a staunch Conservative, and, apart from his\r\nembassy to the emperor in 1524-1543, was mainly occupied during the last\r\nyears of Henry's reign in brandishing the \"whip with six strings.\"\r\n\r\nThe accession of Edward VI opened a fresh and more creditable chapter in\r\nBonner's career. Like Gardiner, he could hardly repudiate that royal\r\nsupremacy, in the establishment of which he had been so active an agent;\r\nbut he began to doubt that supremacy when he saw to what uses it could\r\nbe put by a Protestant council, and either he or Gardiner evolved the\r\ntheory that the royal supremacy was in abeyance during a royal minority.\r\nThe ground was skilfully chosen, but it was not legally nor\r\nconstitutionally tenable. Both he and Gardiner had in fact sought fresh\r\nlicences to exercise their ecclesiastical jurisdiction from the young\r\nking; and, if he was supreme enough to confer jurisdiction, he was\r\nsupreme enough to issue the injunctions and order the visitation to\r\nwhich Bonner objected. Moreover, if a minority involved an abeyance of\r\nthe royal supremacy in the ecclesiastical sphere, it must do the same in\r\nthe temporal sphere, and there could be nothing but anarchy. It was on\r\nthis question that Bonner came into conflict with Edward's government.\r\nHe resisted the visitation of August 1547, and was committed to the\r\nFleet; but he withdrew his opposition, and was released in time to take\r\nan active part against the government in the parliament of November\r\n1547. In the next session, November 1548-March 1549, he was a leading\r\nopponent of the first Act of Uniformity and Book of Common Prayer. When\r\nthese became law, he neglected to enforce them, and on the 1st of\r\nSeptember 1549 he was required by the council to maintain at St Paul's\r\nCross that the royal authority was as great as if the king were forty\r\nyears of age. He failed to comply, and after a seven days' trial he was\r\ndeprived of his bishopric by an ecclesiastical court over which Cranmer\r\npresided, and was sent to the Marshalsea. The fall of Somerset in the\r\nfollowing month raised Bonner's hopes, and he appealed from Cranmer to\r\nthe council. After a struggle the Protestant faction gained the upper\r\nhand, and on the 7th of February 1550 Bonner's deprivation was confirmed\r\nby the council sitting in the Star Chamber, and he was further condemned\r\nto perpetual imprisonment.\r\n\r\nHe was released by Mary's accession, and was at once restored to his\r\nsee, his deprivation being regarded as invalid and Ridley as an\r\nintruder. He vigorously restored Roman Catholicism in his diocese, made\r\nno difficulty about submitting to the papal jurisdiction which he had\r\nforsworn, and in 1555 began the persecution to which he owes his fame.\r\nHis apologists explain that his action was merely \"official,\" but Bonner\r\nwas one of those who brought it to pass that the condemnation of\r\nheretics to the fire should be part of his ordinary official duties. The\r\nenforcement of the first Book of Common Prayer had also been part of his\r\nofficial duties; and the fact that Bonner made no such protest against\r\nthe burning of heretics as he had done in the former case shows that he\r\nfound it the more congenial duty. Tunstal was as good a Catholic as\r\nBonner; he left a different repute behind him, a clear enough indication\r\nof a difference in their deeds.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Bonner did not go out of his way to persecute; many\r\nof his victims were forced upon him by the council, which sometimes\r\nthought that he had not been severe enough (see _Acts of the P.C.\r\n1554-1556_, pp. 115, 139; _1556-1558_, pp. 18, 19, 216, 276). So\r\ncompletely had the state dominated the church that religious\r\npersecutions had become state persecutions, and Bonner was acting as an\r\necclesiastical sheriff in the most refractory district of the realm.\r\nEven Foxe records instances in which Bonner failed to persecute. But he\r\nhad no mercy for a fallen foe; and he is seen at his worst in his\r\nbrutal jeers at Cranmer, when he was entrusted with the duty of\r\ndegrading his former chief. It is a more remarkable fact that, in spite\r\nof his prominence, neither Henry VIII. nor Mary should ever have\r\nadmitted him to the privy council. He seems to have been regarded by his\r\nown party as a useful instrument, especially in disagreeable work,\r\nrather than as a desirable colleague.\r\n\r\nOn her accession Elizabeth refused to allow him to kiss her hand; but he\r\nsat and voted in the parliament and convocation of 1559. In May he\r\nrefused to take the oath of supremacy, acquiring like his colleagues\r\nconsistency with old age. He was sent to the Marshalsea, and a few years\r\nlater was indicted on a charge of praemunire on refusing the oath when\r\ntendered him by his diocesan, Bishop Horne of Winchester. He challenged\r\nthe legality of Horne's consecration, and a special act of parliament\r\nwas passed to meet the point, while the charge against Bonner was\r\nwithdrawn. He died in the Marshalsea on the 5th of September 1569, and\r\nwas buried in St George's, Southwark, at midnight to avoid the risk of a\r\nhostile demonstration.\r\n\r\n  See _Letters and Papers of Henry VIII._ vols. iv.-xx.; _Acts of the\r\n  Privy Council_ (1542-1569); _Lords' Journals_, vol. i.; Wilkins'\r\n  _Concilia_; Foxe's _Acts and Monuments_, ed.

P.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONNET, CHARLES (1720-1793), Swiss naturalist and philosophical writer,\r\nwas born at Geneva on the 13th of March 1720, of a French family driven\r\ninto Switzerland by the religious persecution in the 16th century. He\r\nmade law his profession, but his favourite pursuit was the study of\r\nnatural science. The account of the ant-lion in N.A. Pluche's _Spectacle\r\nde la nature_, which he read in his sixteenth year, turned his attention\r\nto insect life. He procured R.A.F. de Reaumur's work on insects, and\r\nwith the help of live specimens succeeded in adding many observations to\r\nthose of Reaumur and Pluche. In 1740 Bonnet communicated to the academy\r\nof sciences a paper containing a series of experiments establishing what\r\nis now termed parthenogenesis in _aphides_ or tree-lice, which obtained\r\nfor him the honour of being admitted a corresponding member of the\r\nacademy. In 1741 he began to study reproduction by fusion and the\r\nregeneration of lost parts in the freshwater hydra and other animals;\r\nand in the following year he discovered that the respiration of\r\ncaterpillars and butterflies is performed by pores, to which the name of\r\n_stigmata_ has since been given. In 1743 he was admitted a fellow of the\r\nRoyal Society; and in the same year he became a doctor of laws--his last\r\nact in connexion with a profession which had ever been distasteful to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHis first published work appeared in 1745, entitled _Traite\r\nd'insectologie_, in which were collected his various discoveries\r\nregarding insects, along with a preface on the development of germs and\r\nthe scale of organized beings. Botany, particularly the leaves of\r\nplants, next attracted his attention; and after several years of\r\ndiligent study, rendered irksome by the increasing weakness of his\r\neyesight, he published in 1754 one of the most original and interesting\r\nof his works, _Recherches sur l'usage des feuilles dans les plantes_; in\r\nwhich among other things he advances many considerations tending to show\r\n(as has quite recently been done by Francis Darwin) that plants are\r\nendowed with powers of sensation and discernment. But Bonnet's eyesight,\r\nwhich threatened to fail altogether, caused him to turn to philosophy.\r\nIn 1754 his _Essai de psychologie_ was published anonymously in London.\r\nThis was followed by the _Essai analytique sur les facultes de l'ame_\r\n(Copenhagen, 1760), in which he develops his views regarding the\r\nphysiological conditions of mental activity. He returned to physical\r\nscience, but to the speculative side of it, in his _Considerations sur\r\nles corps organises_ (Amsterdam, 1762), designed to refute the theory of\r\nepigenesis, and to explain and defend the doctrine of pre-existent\r\ngerms. In his _Contemplation de la nature_ (Amsterdam, 1764-1765;\r\ntranslated into Italian, German, English and Dutch), one of his most\r\npopular and delightful works, he sets forth, in eloquent language, the\r\ntheory that all the beings in nature form a gradual scale rising from\r\nlowest to highest, without any break in its continuity. His last\r\nimportant work was the _Palingenesie philosophique_ (Geneva, 1769-1770);\r\nin it he treats of the past and future of living beings, and supports\r\nthe idea of the survival of all animals, and the perfecting of their\r\nfaculties in a future state.\r\n\r\nBonnet's life was uneventful. He seems never to have left Switzerland,\r\nnor does he appear to have taken any part in public affairs except for\r\nthe period between 1752 and 1768, during which he was a member of the\r\ncouncil of the republic. The last twenty five years of his life he spent\r\nquietly in the country, at Genthod, near Geneva, where he died after a\r\nlong and painful illness on the 20th of May 1793. His wife was a lady of\r\nthe family of De la Rive.\r\n\r\nThey had no children, but Madame Bonnet's nephew, the celebrated H.B. de\r\nSaussure, was brought up as their son.\r\n\r\nBonnet's philosophical system may be outlined as follows. Man is a\r\ncompound of two distinct substances, mind and body, the one immaterial\r\nand the other material. All knowledge originates in sensations;\r\nsensations follow (whether as physical effects or merely as sequents\r\nBonnet will not say) vibrations in the nerves appropriate to each; and\r\nlastly, the nerves are made to vibrate by external physical stimulus. A\r\nnerve once set in motion by a particular object tends to reproduce that\r\nmotion; so that when it a second time receives an impression from the\r\nsame object it vibrates with less resistance. The sensation accompanying\r\nthis increased flexibility in the nerve is, according to Bonnet, the\r\ncondition of memory. When reflection--that is, the active element in\r\nmind--is applied to the acquisition and combination of sensations, those\r\nabstract ideas are formed which, though generally distinguished from,\r\nare thus merely sensations in combination only. That which puts the mind\r\ninto activity is pleasure or pain; happiness is the end of human\r\nexistence. Bonnet's metaphysical theory is based on two principles\r\nborrowed from Leibnitz--first, that there are not successive acts of\r\ncreation, but that the universe is completed by the single original act\r\nof the divine will, and thereafter moves on by its own inherent force;\r\nand secondly, that there is no break in the continuity of existence. The\r\ndivine Being originally created a multitude of germs in a graduated\r\nscale, each with an inherent power of self-development. At every\r\nsuccessive step in the progress of the universe, these germs, as\r\nprogressively modified, advance nearer to perfection; if some advanced\r\nand others did not there would be a gap in the continuity of the chain.\r\nThus not man only but all other forms of existence are immortal. Nor is\r\nman's mind alone immortal; his body also will pass into the higher\r\nstage, not, indeed, the body he now possesses, but a finer one of which\r\nthe germ at present exists within him. It is impossible, however, to\r\nreach absolute perfection, because the distance is infinite. In this\r\nfinal proposition Bonnet violates his own principle of continuity, by\r\npostulating an interval between the highest created being and the\r\nDivine. It is also difficult to understand whether the constant advance\r\nto perfection is performed by each individual, or only by each race of\r\nbeings as a whole. There seems, in fact, to be an oscillation between\r\ntwo distinct but analogous doctrines--that of the constantly increasing\r\nadvancement of the individual in future stages of existence, and that of\r\nthe constantly increasing advancement of the race as a whole according\r\nto the successive evolutions of the globe.\r\n\r\n  Bonnet's complete works appeared at Neuchatel in 1779-1783, partly\r\n  revised by himself. An English translation of certain portions of the\r\n  _Palingenesie philosophique_ was published in 1787, under the title,\r\n  _Philosophical and Critical Inquiries concerning Christianity_. See\r\n  also A. Lemoine, _Charles Bonnet_ (Paris, 1850); the duc de Caraman,\r\n  _Charles Bonnet, philosophe et naturaliste_ (Paris, 1859); Max Offner,\r\n  _Die Psychologie C. B._ (Leipzig, 1893); Joh. Speck, in _Arch. f.\r\n  Gesch. d. Philos._ x. (1897), xi. (1897), pp. 58 foll., xi. (1898) pp.\r\n  1-211; J. Trembley, _Vie privee et litteraire de C. B._ (Bern, 1794).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONNET (from Lat. _bonetum_, a kind of stuff, then the cap made of this\r\nstuff), originally a soft cap or covering for the head, the common term\r\nin English till the end of the 17th century; this sense survives in\r\nScotland, especially as applied to the cap known as a \"glengarry.\" The\r\n\"bonnet\" of a ship's sail now means an additional piece laced on to the\r\nbottom, but it seems to have formerly meant a piece laced to the top,\r\nthe term \"to vail the bonnet\" being found at the beginning of the 16th\r\ncentury to mean \"strike sail\" (from the Fr. _avaler_), to let down. In\r\nmodern times \"bonnet\" has come to be used of a type of head-covering for\r\nwomen, differentiated from \"hat\" by fitting closely to the head and\r\noften having no brim, but varying considerably in shape according to the\r\nperiod and fashion. The term, by a natural extension, is also applied to\r\ncertain protective devices, as in a steam-engine or safety-lamp, or in\r\nslang use to a gambler's accomplice, a decoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONNEVAL, CLAUDE ALEXANDRE, COMTE DE (1675-1747), French adventurer,\r\nknown also as AHMED PASHA, was the descendant of an old family of\r\nLimousin. He was born on the 14th of July 1675, and at the age of\r\nthirteen joined the Royal Marine Corps. After three years he entered the\r\narmy, in which he rose to the command of a regiment. He served in the\r\nItalian campaigns under Catinat, Villeroi and Vendome, and in the\r\nNetherlands under Luxemburg, giving proofs of indomitable courage and\r\ngreat military ability. His insolent bearing towards the minister of war\r\nwas made matter for a court-martial (1704). He was condemned to death,\r\nbut saved himself by flight to Germany. Through the influence of Prince\r\nEugene he obtained a general's command in the Austrian army, and fought\r\nwith great bravery and distinction against France, and afterwards\r\nagainst Turkey. He was present at Malplaquet, and was severely wounded\r\nat Peterwardein. The proceedings against him in France were then allowed\r\nto drop, and he visited Paris, and married a daughter of Marshal de\r\nBiron. He returned, however, after a short time to the Austrian army,\r\nand fought with distinction at Belgrade. He might now have risen to the\r\nhighest rank, had he not made himself disagreeable to Prince Eugene, who\r\nsent him as master of the ordnance to the Low Countries. There his\r\nungovernable temper led him into a quarrel with the marquis de Prie,\r\nEugene's deputy governor in the Netherlands, who answered his challenge\r\nby placing him in confinement. A court-martial was again held upon him,\r\nand he was condemned to death; but the emperor commuted the sentence to\r\none year's imprisonment and banishment. Bonneval, soon after his\r\nrelease, offered his services to the Turkish government, professed the\r\nMahommedan faith, and took the name of Ahmed. He was made a pasha, and\r\nappointed to organize and command the artillery. He rendered valuable\r\nservices to the sultan in his war with Russia, and with the famous Nadir\r\nShah. As a reward he received the governorship of Chios, but he soon\r\nfell under the suspicion of the Porte, and was banished for a time to\r\nthe shores of the Black Sea. He was meditating a return to Europe and\r\nChristianity when he died at Constantinople on the 23rd of March 1747.\r\n\r\n  The _Memoirs_ published under his name are spurious. See Prince de\r\n  Ligne, _Memoire sur le comte de Bonneval_ (Paris, 1817); and A.\r\n  Vandal, _Le Pacha Bonneval_ (Paris, 1885).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONNEVILLE, BENJAMIN L.E. (1795-1878), American military engineer and\r\nexplorer, was born in France about 1795. He emigrated to the United\r\nStates in early youth, and graduated at the United States Military\r\nAcademy at West Point in 1815. He was engaged in the construction of\r\nmilitary roads in the south-west, and became a captain of infantry in\r\n1825. In 1831-1836, having obtained leave of absence from the army, he\r\nconducted, largely on his own responsibility, an exploring expedition to\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, proceeding up the Platte river through parts of the\r\nlater states of Colorado and Wyoming into the Great Salt Lake basin and\r\nthence into California. After being absolutely cut off from civilization\r\nfor several years, and having his name struck from the army list, he\r\nreturned with an interesting and valuable account of his adventures,\r\nwhich was edited and amplified by Washington Irving and published under\r\nthe title _The Rocky Mountains: or Scenes, Incidents, and Adventures in\r\nthe Far West; from the Journal of Captain Benjamin L.E. Bonneville of\r\nthe Army of the United States_ (2 vols., 1837), subsequent editions\r\nbearing the title _The Adventures of Captain Bonneville, U.S.A., in the\r\nRocky Mountains and the Far West._ Bonneville became a major in 1845,\r\nand was breveted lieutenant-colonel for gallantry in the battles of\r\nContreras and Churubusco during the Mexican War. He became a colonel in\r\n1855, commanded the Gila river expedition against the Apaches in 1857,\r\nand from 1858 to 1861 commanded the department of New Mexico. He was\r\nretired in 1861, but served during the Civil War as recruiting officer\r\nand commandant of barracks at St Louis, Missouri, receiving the brevet\r\nrank of brigadier-general in 1865. He died at Fort Smith, Arkansas, on\r\nthe 12th of June 1878. The extinct glacial lake which once covered what\r\nis now north-western Utah has been named in his honour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONNEY, THOMAS GEORGE (1833-   ), English geologist, eldest son of the\r\nRev. Thomas Bonney, master of the grammar school at Rugeley, was born in\r\nthat town on the 27th of July 1833. Educated at Uppingham and St John's\r\nCollege, Cambridge, he graduated as 12th wrangler in 1856, and was\r\nordained in the following year. From 1856 to 1861 he was mathematical\r\nmaster at Westminster school, and geology was pursued by him only as a\r\nrecreation, mainly in Alpine regions. In 1868 he was appointed tutor at\r\nSt John's College and lecturer in geology. His attention was specially\r\ndirected to the study of the igneous and metamorphic rocks in Alpine\r\nregions and in various parts of England, in the Lizard, at Salcombe, in\r\nCharnwood Forest, in Wales and the Scottish Highlands. In 1877 he was\r\nchosen professor of geology in University College, London. He became\r\nsecretary and afterwards president of the Geological Society\r\n(1884-1886), secretary of the British Association (1881-1885), president\r\nof the Mineralogical Society and of the Alpine Club. He was also in 1887\r\nappointed honorary canon of Manchester. His purely scientific works are:\r\n_Cambridgeshire Geology_ (1875); _The Story of our Planet_ (1893);\r\n_Charles Lyell and Modern Geology_ (1895); _Ice Work, Past and Present_\r\n(1896); _Volcanoes_ (1899). In addition to many papers published in the\r\n_Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society_ and _Geological Magazine_,\r\nhe wrote several popular works on Alpine Regions, on English and Welsh\r\nscenery, as well as on theological subjects.\r\n\r\n  See _Geological Magazine_ for September 1901 (with bibliography).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONNIER, ANGE ELISABETH LOUIS ANTOINE (1749-1799), French diplomatist,\r\nwas a member of the Legislative Assembly and of the Convention, where he\r\nvoted with the majority. During the Directory he was charged with\r\ndiplomatic missions, first to Lille and then to the congress of Rastadt\r\n(October 1797), where the negotiations dragged wearily along and were\r\nfinally broken. On the 28th of April 1799 the plenipotentiaries on\r\nleaving Rastadt were assailed at the gates of the town by Hungarian\r\nhussars, probably charged to secure their papers. Bonnier and one of his\r\ncolleagues, Claude Roberjot, were killed. The other, Jean Debry, was\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\n  See Huefer, _Der Rastadtergesandtenmord_ (Bonn, 1896).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONNIVET, GUILLAUME GOUFFIER, SEIGNEUR DE (c. 1488-1525), French\r\nsoldier, was the younger brother of Artus Gouffier, seigneur de Boisy,\r\ntutor of Francis I. of France. Bonnivet was brought up with Francis, and\r\nafter the young king's accession he became one of the most powerful of\r\nthe royal favourites. In 1515 he was made admiral of France. In the\r\nimperial election of 1519 he superintended the candidature of Francis,\r\nand spent vast sums of money in his efforts to secure the votes of the\r\nelectors, but without success. He was the implacable enemy of the\r\nconstable de Bourbon and contributed to his downfall. In command of the\r\narmy of Navarre in 1521, he occupied Fuenterrabia and was probably\r\nresponsible for its non-restoration and for the consequent renewal of\r\nhostilities. He succeeded Marshal Lautrec in 1523 in the command of the\r\narmy of Italy and entered the Milanese, but was defeated and forced to\r\neffect a disastrous retreat, in which the chevalier Bayard perished. He\r\nwas one of the principal commanders of the army which Francis led into\r\nItaly at the end of 1524, and died at the battle of Pavia on the 24th of\r\nFebruary 1525. Brantome says that it was at Bonnivet's suggestion that\r\nthe battle of Pavia was fought, and that, seeing the disaster he had\r\ncaused, he courted and found death heroically in the fight. In spite of\r\nhis failures as a general and diplomatist, his handsome face and\r\nbrilliant wit enabled him to retain throughout his life the intimacy and\r\nconfidence of his king. He was a man of licentious life. According to\r\nBrantome he was the successful rival of the king for the favours of\r\nMadame de Chateaubriand, and if we may believe him to have been--as is\r\nvery probable--the hero of the fourth story of the _Heptameron_,\r\nMarguerite d'Angouleme had occasion to resist his importunities.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Bonnivet's correspondence in the Bibliotheque Nationale,\r\n  Paris; memoirs of the time; complete works of Brantome, vol. iii.,\r\n  published by Ludovic Lalanne for the Societe de l'Histoire de France\r\n  (1864 seq.). See also Ernest Lavisse, _Histoire de France_, vol. v.,\r\n  by H. Lemonnier (1903-1904).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONOMI, GIUSEPPI (1739-1808), English architect, was born at Rome on the\r\n19th of January 1739. After attaining a considerable reputation in\r\nItaly, he came in 1767 to England, and finally settled in practice\r\nthere. He was the innocent cause of the retirement of Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds from the presidency of the Royal Academy. Sir Joshua wished him\r\nto become a full Academician, regarding him as a fitting occupant of the\r\nthen vacant chair of perspective. But the majority of the Academicians\r\nwere opposed to this suggestion, and Bonomi was elected an associate\r\nonly, and that merely by the president's casting vote. Bonomi was\r\nlargely responsible for the revival of classical architecture in\r\nEngland. His most famous work was the Italian villa at Roseneath,\r\nDumbartonshire, designed for the duke of Argyll. In 1804 he was\r\nappointed honorary architect to St Peter's at Rome. He died in London on\r\nthe 9th of March 1808.\r\n\r\nHis son, GIUSEPPI BONOMI (1796-1878), studied art in London at the Royal\r\nAcademy, and became a sculptor, but is best known as an illustrator of\r\nthe leading Egyptological publications of his day. From 1824 to 1832 he\r\nwas in Egypt, making drawings of the monuments in the company of Burton,\r\nLane and Wilkinson. In 1833 he visited the mosque of Omar, returning\r\nwith detailed drawings, and from 1842 to 1844 was again in Egypt,\r\nattached to the Prussian government exploration expedition under\r\nLepsius. He assisted in the arrangement of the Egyptian court at the\r\nCrystal Palace in 1853, and in 1861 was appointed curator of the Soane\r\nMuseum. He died on the 3rd of March 1878.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONONCINI (or BUONONCINI), GIOVANNI BATTISTA (1672?-1750?), Italian\r\nmusical composer, was the son of the composer Giovanni Maria Bononcini,\r\nbest known as the author of a treatise entitled _Il Musico Prattico_\r\n(Bologna, 1673), and brother of the composer Marc' Antonio Bononcini,\r\nwith whom he has often been confused. He is said to have been born at\r\nModena in 1672, but the date of his birth must probably be placed some\r\nten years earlier. He was a pupil of his father and of Colonna, and\r\nproduced his first operas, _Tullo Ostilio_ and _Serse_, at Rome in 1694.\r\nIn 1696 he was at the court of Berlin, and between 1700 and 1720 divided\r\nhis time between Vienna and Italy. In 1720 he was summoned to London by\r\nthe Royal Academy of Music, and produced several operas, enjoying the\r\nprotection of the Marlborough family. About 1731 it was discovered that\r\nhe had a few years previously palmed off a madrigal by Lotti as his own\r\nwork, and after a long correspondence he was obliged to leave the\r\ncountry. He remained for several years in France, and in 1748 was\r\nsummoned to Vienna to compose music in honour of the peace of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle. He then went to Venice as a composer of operas, and\r\nnothing more is known of his life.\r\n\r\nBononcini's rivalry with Handel will always ensure him immortality, but\r\nhe was in himself a musician of considerable merit, and seems to have\r\ninfluenced the style, not only of Handel but even of Alessandro\r\nScarlatti. Either he or his brother (our knowledge of the two composers'\r\nlives is at present not sufficient to distinguish their works clearly)\r\nwas the inventor of that sharply rhythmical style conspicuous in _Il\r\nTrionfo di Camilla_ (1697), the success of which at Naples probably\r\ninduced Scarlatti to adopt a similar type of melody. It is noticeable in\r\nthe once popular air of Bononcini, _L'esperto nocchiero_, and in the air\r\n_Vado ben spesso_, long attributed to Salvator Rosa, but really by\r\nBononcini.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONONIA (mod. _Bologna_), the chief town of ancient Aemilia (see\r\nAEMILIA, VIA), in Italy. It was said by classical writers to be of\r\nEtruscan origin, and to have been founded, under the name Felsina, from\r\nPerusia by Aucnus or Ocnus. Excavations of recent years have, however,\r\nled to the discovery of some 600 ancient Italic (Ligurian?) huts, and of\r\ncemeteries of the same and the succeeding (Umbrian) periods (800-600?\r\nB.C.), of which the latter immediately preceded the Etruscan\r\ncivilization (c. 600-400 B.C.). An extensive Etruscan necropolis, too,\r\nwas discovered on the site of the modern cemetery (A. Zannoni, _Scavi\r\ndella Certosa_, Bologna, 1876), and others in the public garden and on\r\nthe Arnoaldi Veli property (_Notizie degli Scavi, indice_ 1876-1900,\r\ns.v. \"Bologna\"). In 196 B.C., when the town first appears in history,\r\nit was already in the possession of the Boii, and had probably by this\r\ntime changed its name, and in 189 B.C. it became a Roman colony. After\r\nthe conquest of the mountain tribes, its importance was assured by its\r\nposition on the Via Aemilia, by which it was connected in 187 B.C. with\r\nAriminum and Placentia, and on the road, constructed in the same year,\r\nto Arretium; while another road was made, perhaps in 175 B.C., to\r\nAquilelia. It thus became the centre of the road system of north Italy.\r\nIn 90 B.C. it acquired Roman citizenship. In 43 B.C. it was used as his\r\nbase of operations against Decius Brutus by Mark Antony, who settled\r\ncolonists here; Augustus added others later, constructing a new aqueduct\r\nfrom the Letta, a tributary of the Rhenus, which was restored to use in\r\n1881 (G. Gozzadini in _Notizie degli Scavi_, 1881, 162). After a fire in\r\nA.D. 53 the emperor Claudius made a subvention of 10 million sesterces\r\n(L1,087,500). Bononia seems, in fact, to have been one of the most\r\nimportant cities of ancient Italy, as Bologna is of modern Italy. It was\r\nable to resist Alaric in 410 and to preserve its existence during the\r\ngeneral ruin. It afterwards belonged to the Greek exarchate of Ravenna.\r\nOf remains of the Roman period, however, there are none above ground,\r\nthough various discoveries have been made from time to time within the\r\ncity walls, the modern streets corresponding more or less, as it seems,\r\nwith the ancient lines. Remains of the bridge of the Via Aemilia over\r\nthe Rhenus have also been found--consisting of parts of the parapets on\r\neach side, in brick-faced concrete which belong to a restoration, the\r\noriginal construction (probably by Augustus in 2 B.C.) having been in\r\nblocks of Veronese red marble--and also of a massive protecting wall\r\nslightly above it, of late date, in the construction of which a large\r\nnumber of Roman tombstones were used. The bed of the river was found to\r\nhave risen at least 20 ft. since the collapse of this bridge (about A.D.\r\n1000), the total length of which must have been about 650 ft. and the\r\nwidth between the parapets 38-1/2 ft.\r\n\r\n  See E. Brizio in _Notizie degli Scavi_ (1896), 125, 450; (1897) 330;\r\n  (1898) 465; (1902) 532. (T. As.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONPLAND, AIME JACQUES ALEXANDRE (1773-1858), French traveller and\r\nbotanist, whose real name was GOUJAND, was born at La Rochelle on the\r\n22nd of August 1773. After serving as a surgeon in the French army and\r\nstudying under J.N. Corvisart at Paris, he accompanied A. von Humboldt\r\nduring five years of travel in Mexico, Colombia and the districts\r\nbordering on the Orinoco and Amazon. In these explorations he collected\r\nand classified about 6000 plants till then mostly unknown in Europe,\r\nwhich he afterwards described in _Plantes equinoxiales_, &c. (Paris,\r\n1808-1816). On returning to Paris he received a pension and the\r\nsuperintendence of the gardens at Malmaison, and published _Monographie\r\ndes Melastomees_ (1806), and _Description des plantes rares de Navarre_\r\n(1813). In 1816 he set out, taking with him various European plants, for\r\nBuenos Aires, where he was elected professor of natural history, an\r\noffice which he soon quitted in order to explore central South America.\r\nWhile journeying to Bolivia he was arrested in 1821, by command of Dr\r\nFrancia, the dictator of Paraguay, who detained him until 1831. On\r\nregaining liberty he resided at San Borga in the province of Corrientes,\r\nuntil his removal in 1853 to Santa Anna, where he died on the 4th of May\r\n1858.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONSTETTEN, CHARLES VICTOR DE (1745-1832), Swiss writer, an excellent\r\ntype of a liberal patrician, more French than Swiss, and a good\r\nrepresentative of the Gallicized Bern of the 18th century. By birth a\r\nmember of one of the great patrician families of Bern, he was educated\r\nin his native town, at Yverdon, and (1763-1766) at Geneva, where he came\r\nunder the influence of Rousseau and of Charles Bonnet, and imbibed\r\nliberal sentiments. Recalled to Bern by his father, he was soon sent to\r\nLeiden, and then visited (1769) England, where he became a friend of the\r\npoet Gray. After his father's death (1770) he made a long journey in\r\nItaly, and on his return to Bern (1774) entered political life, for\r\nwhich he was unfitted by reason of his liberal ideas, which led him to\r\npatronize and encourage Johannes Muller, the future Swiss historian. In\r\n1779 he was named the Bernese bailiff of Saanen or Gessenay (here he\r\nwrote his _Lettres pastorales sur une contree de la Suisse_, published\r\nin German in 1781), and in 1787 was transferred in a similar capacity to\r\nNyon, from which post he had to retire after taking part (1791) in a\r\nfestival to celebrate the destruction of the Bastille. From 1795 to 1797\r\nhe governed (for the Swiss Confederation) the Italian-speaking districts\r\nof Lugano, Locarno, Mendrisio and Val Maggia, of which he published\r\n(1797) a pleasing description, and into which he is said to have\r\nintroduced the cultivation of the potato. The French revolution of 1798\r\nin Switzerland drove him again into private life. He spent the years\r\n1798 to 1801 in Denmark, with his friend Fredirika Brun, and then\r\nsettled down in 1803 in Geneva for the rest of his life. There he\r\nenjoyed the society of many distinguished persons, among whom was\r\n(1809-1817) Madame de Stael. It was during this period that he published\r\nhis most celebrated work, _L'Homme du midi et l'homme du nord_ (1824), a\r\nstudy of the influence of climate on different nations, the north being\r\nexalted at the expense of the south. Among his other works are the\r\n_Recherches sur la nature et les lois de l'imagination_ (1807), and the\r\n_Etudes de l'homme, ou Recherches sur les facultes de penser et de\r\nsentir_ (1821), but he was better as an observer than as a philosopher.\r\n\r\n  Lives by A. Steinlen (Lausanne, 1860), by C. Morell (Winterthur,\r\n  1861), and by R. Willy (Bern, 1898). See also vol. xiv. of\r\n  Sainte-Beuve's _Causeries du Lundi_.     (W. A. B. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONUS (a jocular application of the Lat. _bonus_, for _bonum_, \"a good\r\nthing\"), a sum paid to shareholders in a joint-stock company, as an\r\naddition to the ordinary dividend, and generally given out of\r\naccumulated profits, or out of profits gained from exceptional\r\ntransactions. As used by insurance companies, the word denotes the\r\naddition made to the amount of a policy by a distribution _pro rata_ of\r\naccumulated profits or surplus. In a more general sense, bonus is any\r\npayment or remuneration over and above what is due and promised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONZE (from Japanese _bonzo_, probably a mispronunciation of Chinese\r\n_fan sung_, \"religious person\"), the European name for the members of\r\nthe Buddhist religious orders of Japan and China. The word is loosely\r\nused of all the Buddhist priests in those and the neighbouring\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK, the common name for any literary production of some bulk, now\r\napplied particularly to a printed composition forming a volume, or, if\r\nin more than one volume, a single organic literary work. The word is\r\nalso used descriptively for the internal divisions or sections of a\r\ncomprehensive work.\r\n\r\nThe word \"book\" is found with variations of form and gender in all the\r\nTeutonic languages, the original form postulated for it being a strong\r\nfeminine _Boks_, which must have been used in the sense of a\r\nwriting-tablet. The most obvious connexion of this is with the old\r\nEnglish _boc_, a beech tree, and though this is not free from\r\nphilological difficulties, no probable alternative has been suggested.\r\n\r\nAs early as 2400 B.C., in Babylonia, legal decisions, revenue accounts,\r\n&c. were inscribed in cuneiform characters on clay tablets and placed in\r\njars, arranged on shelves and labelled by clay tablets attached by\r\nstraws. In the 7th century B.C. a library of literary works written on\r\nsuch tablets existed at Nineveh, founded by Sargan (721-705 B.C.). As in\r\nthe case of the \"Creation\" series at the British Museum the narrative\r\nwas sometimes continued from one tablet to another, and some of the\r\ntablets are inscribed with entries forming a catalogue of the library.\r\nThese clay tablets are perhaps entitled to be called books, but they are\r\nout of the direct ancestry of the modern printed book with which we are\r\nhere chiefly concerned. One of the earliest direct ancestors of this\r\nextant is a roll of eighteen columns in Egyptian hieratic writing of\r\nabout the 25th century B.C. in the Musee de Louvre at Paris, preserving\r\nthe maxims of Ptah-hetep. Papyrus, the material on which the manuscript\r\n(known as the Papyrus Prisse) is written, was made from the pith of a\r\nreed chiefly found in Egypt, and is believed to have been in use as a\r\nwriting material as early as about 4000 B.C. It continued to be the\r\nusual vehicle of writing until the early centuries of the Christian era,\r\nwas used for pontifical bulls until A.D. 1022, and occasionally even\r\nlater; while in Coptic manuscripts, for which its use had been revived\r\nin the 7th century, it was employed as late as about A.D. 1250. It was\r\nfrom the name by which they called the papyrus, [Greek: bublos] or\r\n[Greek: biblos], that the Greeks formed [Greek: biblion], their word for\r\na book, the plural of which (mistaken for a feminine singular) has given\r\nus our own word Bible. In the 2nd century B.C. Eumenes II., king of\r\nPergamus, finding papyrus hard to procure, introduced improvements into\r\nthe preparations of the skins of sheep and calves for writing purposes,\r\nand was rewarded by the name of his kingdom being preserved in the word\r\n_pergamentum_, whence our \"parchment,\" by which the dressed material is\r\nknown. In the 10th century the supremacy which parchment had gradually\r\nestablished was attacked by the introduction from the East of a new\r\nwriting material made from a pulp of linen rags, and the name of the\r\nvanquished papyrus was transferred to this new rival. Paper-mills were\r\nset up in Europe in the 12th century, and the use of paper gained\r\nground, though not very rapidly, until on the invention of printing, the\r\ndemand for a cheap material for books, and the ease with which paper\r\ncould be worked on a press, gave it a practical monopoly. This it\r\npreserved until nearly the end of the 19th century, when substances\r\nmainly composed of wood-pulp, esparto grass and clay largely took its\r\nplace, while continuing, as in the transition from papyrus to\r\nlinen-pulp, to pass under the same name (see PAPER).\r\n\r\nSo long as the use of papyrus was predominant the usual form of a book\r\nwas that of the _volumen_ or roll, wound round a stick, or sticks. The\r\nmodern form of book, called by the Latins _codex_ (a word originally\r\nused for the stump of a tree, or block of wood, and thence for the\r\nthree-leaved tablets into which the block was sawn) was coming into\r\nfashion in Martial's time at Rome, and gained ground in proportion as\r\nparchment superseded papyrus. The _volumen_ as it was unrolled revealed\r\na series of narrow columns of writing, and the influence of this\r\narrangement is seen in the number of columns in the earliest codices.\r\nThus in the Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus of the Bible, both of\r\nthe 4th century, there are respectively four and three columns to a\r\npage; in the Codex Alexandrinus (5th century) only two; in the Codex\r\nBezae (6th century) only one, and from this date to the invention of\r\nprinting, while there were great changes in handwriting, the arrangement\r\nof books changed very little, single or double columns being used as was\r\nfound convenient. In the external form of books there was much the same\r\nconservatism. In the Codex Amiatinus written in England in the 8th\r\ncentury one of the miniatures shows a book in a red leather cover, and\r\nthe arrangement of the pattern on this curiously resembles that of the\r\n15th-century red leather bindings predominant in the Biblioteca\r\nLaurenziana at Florence, in which the codex itself is preserved. In the\r\nsame way some of the small stamps used in Oxford bindings in the 15th\r\ncentury are nearly indistinguishable from those used in England three\r\ncenturies earlier. Much fuller details as to the history of written\r\nbooks in these as well as other respects will be found in the article\r\nMANUSCRIPT, to which the following account of the fortunes of books\r\nafter the invention of printing must be regarded as supplementary.\r\n\r\nBetween a manuscript written in a formal book-hand and an early printed\r\ncopy of the same work, printed in the same district as the manuscript\r\nhad been written, the difference in general appearance was very slight.\r\nThe printer's type (see TYPOGRAPHY) would as a rule be based on a\r\nhandwriting considered by the scribes appropriate to works of the same\r\nclass; the chapter headings, headlines, initial-letters, paragraph\r\nmarks, and in some cases illustrations, would be added by hand in a\r\nstyle which might closely resemble the like decorations in the\r\nmanuscript from which the text was being printed; there would be no\r\ntitle-page, and very probably no statement of any kind that the book was\r\nprinted, or as to where, when or by whom it was produced. Information as\r\nto these points, if given at all, was reserved for a paragraph at the\r\nend of the book, called by bibliographers a colophon (q.v.), to which\r\nthe printer often attached a device consisting of his arms, or those of\r\nthe town in which he worked, or a fanciful design. These devices are\r\nsometimes beautiful and often take the place of a statement of the\r\nprinter's name. Many facsimiles or copies of them have been\r\npublished.[1] The first dated title-page known[2] is a nine-line\r\nparagraph on an otherwise blank page giving the title of the book,\r\n_Sermo ad populum predicabilis in festo presentacionis Beatissime Marie\r\nSemper Virginis_, with some words in its praise, the date 1470 in roman\r\nnumerals, and a reference to further information on the next page. The\r\nbook in which this title-page occurs was printed by Arnold ther Hoernen\r\nat Cologne. Six years later Erhard Ratdolt and his partners at Venice\r\nprinted their names and the date, together with some verses describing\r\nthe book, on the title-page of a Latin calendar, and surrounded the\r\nwhole with a border in four pieces. For another twenty years, however,\r\nwhen title-pages were used at all, they usually consisted merely of the\r\nshort title of the book, with sometimes a woodcut or the printer's\r\n(subsequently the publisher's) device beneath it, decoration being more\r\noften bestowed on the first page of text, which was sometimes surrounded\r\nby an ornamental border. Title-pages completed by the addition of the\r\nname and address of printer or publisher, and also by the date, did not\r\nbecome common till about 1520.\r\n\r\nWhile the development of the title-page was thus slow the completion of\r\nthe book, independently of handwork, in other respects was fairly rapid.\r\nPrinted illustrations appear first in the form of rude woodcuts in some\r\nsmall books produced at Bamberg by Albrecht Pfister about 1461.\r\nPagination and headlines were first used by ther Hoernen at Cologne in\r\n1470 and 1471; printed signatures to guide binders in arranging the\r\nquires correctly (see BIBLIOGRAPHY AND BIBLIOLOGY) by Johann Koelhoff,\r\nalso at Cologne in 1472. Illustrations abound in the books printed at\r\nAugsburg in the early 'seventies, and in the 'eighties are common in\r\nGermany, France and the Low Countries, while in Italy their full\r\ndevelopment dated from about 1490. Experiments were made in both Italy\r\nand France with illustrations engraved on copper, but in the 15th\r\ncentury these met with no success.\r\n\r\nBound with wooden boards covered with stamped leather, or with half of\r\nthe boards left uncovered, many of the earliest printed books are\r\nimmensely large and heavy, especially the great choir-books, the Bibles\r\nand the Biblical and legal commentaries, in which a great mass of notes\r\nsurrounds the text. The paper on which these large books were printed\r\nwas also extraordinarily thick and strong. For more popular books small\r\nfolio was at first a favourite size, but towards the end of the century\r\nsmall thin quartos were much in vogue. Psalters, books of hours, and\r\nother prayer-books were practically the only very small books in use.\r\nOwing to changes, not only in the value of money but in the coinage, the\r\ncost of books in the 15th century is extremely difficult to ascertain. A\r\nvellum copy of the first printed Bible (Mainz, c. 1455) in two large\r\nfolio volumes, when rubricated and illuminated, is said to have been\r\nworth 100 florins. In 1467 the bishop of Aleria writing to Pope Paul II.\r\nspeaks of the introduction of printing having reduced prices to\r\none-fifth of what they had previously been. Fifteen \"Legends\" bequeathed\r\nby Caxton to St Margaret's, Westminster, were sold at prices varying\r\nfrom 6s. 8d. to 5s. This would be cheap for a large work like the\r\n_Golden Legend_, but the bequest was more probably of copies of the\r\nSarum _Legenda_, or Lectionary, a much smaller book.\r\n\r\n_16th Century._--The popularization of the small octavo by Aldus at\r\nVenice in 1501 and the introduction in these handy books of a new type,\r\nthe italic, had far-reaching consequences. Italics grew steadily in\r\nfavour during the greater part of the century, and about 1570 had almost\r\nbecome the standard vernacular type of Italy. In France also they were\r\nvery popular, the attempt to introduce a rival French cursive type\r\n(_lettres de civilite_) attaining no success. In England they gained\r\nonly slight popularity, but roman type, which had not been used at all\r\nin the 15th century, made steady progress in its contest with black\r\nletter, which by the end of the century was little used save for Bibles\r\nand proclamations. The modern practice in the use of i and j, u and v\r\ndates from about 1580, though not firmly established till the reign of\r\nCharles I.\r\n\r\nIn the second quarter of the 16th century the French printers at Paris\r\nand Lyons halved the size of the Aldine octavos in their small\r\nsextodecimos, which found a ready market, though not a lasting one, the\r\nprinters of Antwerp and Leiden ousting them with still smaller books in\r\n24mo or small twelves. These little books were printed on paper much\r\nthinner than had previously been used. The size and weight of books was\r\nalso reduced by the substitution of pasteboards for wooden sides. Gold\r\ntooling came into use on bindings, and in the second half of the century\r\nvery elaborate decoration was in vogue in France until checked by a\r\nsumptuary law. On the other hand a steady decline in the quality of\r\npaper combined with the abandonment of the old simple outline woodcuts\r\nfor much more ambitious designs made it increasingly difficult for\r\nprinters to do justice to the artists' work, and woodcuts, at first in\r\nthe Low Countries and afterwards in England and elsewhere, were\r\ngradually superseded by copper-plates printed separately from the text.\r\nAt the beginning of this century in England a ballad or Christmas carol\r\nsold for a halfpenny and thin quarto chapbooks for 4d. (a price which\r\nlasted through the century), the Great Bible of 1541 was priced at 10s.\r\nin sheets and 12s. bound, Edward VI.'s prayer-book (1549) at 2s. 2d.\r\nunbound, and 3s. 8d. in paste or boards; Sidney's _Arcadia_ and other\r\nworks in 1598 sold for 9s.\r\n\r\n_17th Century._--Although the miniature editions issued by the Elzevirs\r\nat Leiden, especially those published about 1635, have attracted\r\ncollectors, printing in the 17th century was at its worst, reaching its\r\nlowest depths in England in the second quarter. After this there was a\r\nsteady improvement, partly due to slight modifications of the old\r\nprinting presses, adopted first in Holland and copied by the English\r\nprinters. In the first half of the century many English books, although\r\npoorly printed, were ornamented with attractive frontispieces, or\r\nportraits, engraved on copper. During the same period, English\r\nprayer-books and small Bibles and New Testaments were frequently covered\r\nwith gay embroideries in coloured silks and gold or silver thread. In\r\nthe second half of the century the leather bindings of Samuel Mearne, to\r\nsome extent imitated from those of the great French binder Le Gascon,\r\nwere the daintiest England had yet produced. For trade bindings rough\r\ncalf and sheepskin were most used, and the practice of lettering books\r\non the back, instead of on the sides or fore-edges or not at all, came\r\ngradually into favour. Owing to the increase of money, and in some cases\r\nto the action of monopolists, in others to the increased payments made\r\nto authors, book-prices rather rose than fell. Thus church Bibles, which\r\nhad been sold at 10s. in 1541, rose successively to 25s., 30s. and (in\r\n1641) to 40s. Single plays in quarto cost 6d. each in Shakespeare's\r\ntime, 1s. after the Restoration. The Shakespeare folio of 1623 is said\r\nto have been published at L1. Bishop Walton's polyglot Bible in six\r\nlarge volumes was sold for L10 to subscribers, but resulted in a heavy\r\nloss. Izaak Walton's _Compleat Angler_ was priced at 1s. 6d. in\r\nsheepskin, _Paradise Lost_ at 3s., _The Pilgrim's Progress_ at 1s. 6d.;\r\nDryden's _Virgil_ was published by subscription at L5:5s. It was a\r\nhandsome book, ornamented with plates; but in the case of this and other\r\nsubscription books a desire to honour or befriend the author was mainly\r\nresponsible for the high price.\r\n\r\n_18th Century._--During this century there was a notable improvement\r\nalike in paper, type and presswork in both France and England, and\r\ntowards the end of the century in Germany and Italy also. Books became\r\ngenerally neat and sometimes elegant. Book-illustration revived with the\r\nFrench _livres-a-vignettes_, and English books were illustrated by\r\nGravelot and other French artists. In the last quarter of the century\r\nthe work of Bewick heralded a great revival in woodcut illustrations, or\r\nas the use of the graver now entitled them to be called, wood\r\nengravings. The best 18th-century binders, until the advent of Roger\r\nPayne, were inferior to those of the 17th century, but the technique of\r\nthe average work was better. In trade bindings the use of sheepskin and\r\ncalf became much less common, and books were mostly cased in paper\r\nboards. The practice of publishing poetry by subscription at a very high\r\nprice, which Dryden had found lucrative, was followed by Prior and Pope.\r\nSingle poems by Pope, however, were sold at 1s. and 1s. 6d. Novels were\r\nmostly in several volumes. The price at the beginning of the century was\r\nmostly 1s. 6d. each. It then remained fairly steady for many years, and\r\nat the close of the century rose again. Thus Miss Burney's _Evelina_ (3\r\nvols., 1778) sold for 7s. 5d., her _Cecilia_ (5 vols., 1782) for 12s.\r\n6d., and her _Camilla_ (5 vols., 1796) for L1:1s. Johnson's _Dictionary_\r\n(2 vols. folio, 1755) cost L4:4s. in sheets, L4:15s. in boards.\r\n\r\n_19th Century._--great change in the appearance of books was caused by\r\nthe use first of glazed calico (about 1820), afterwards (about 1830) of\r\ncloth for the cases of books as issued by their publishers. At first the\r\nlettering was printed on paper labels, but soon it was stamped in gilt\r\non the cloth, and in the last quarter of the century many very beautiful\r\ncovers were designed for English and American books. The designs for\r\nleather bindings were for many years chiefly imitated from older work,\r\nbut towards the end of the 'eighties much greater originality began to\r\nbe shown. Book illustrations passed through many phases. As subsidiary\r\nmethods colour-prints, line engravings, lithographs and etchings were\r\nall used during the first half of the century, but the main reliance was\r\non wood-engraving, in which extraordinary technical skill was developed.\r\nIn the 'sixties and the years which immediately preceded and followed\r\nthem many of the chief English artists supplied the engravers with\r\ndrawings. In the last decade of the century wood-engraving was\r\npractically killed by the perfection attained by photographic methods of\r\nreproduction (see PROCESS), the most popular of these methods entailing\r\nthe use of paper heavily coated with china clay. During the century\r\ntrade-printing, both in England and America, steadily improved, and the\r\nwork done by William Morris at his Kelmscott Press (1891-1896), and by\r\nother amateur printers who imitated him, set a new standard of beauty of\r\ntype and ornament, and of richness of general effect. On the other hand\r\nthe demand for cheap reprints of famous works induced by the immense\r\nextension of the reading public was supplied by scores of pretty if\r\nflimsy editions at 1s. 6d. and 1s. and even less. The problem of how to\r\nproduce books at moderate prices on good paper and well sewn, was left\r\nfor the 20th century to settle. About 1894 the number of such\r\nmedium-priced books was greatly increased in England by the substitution\r\nof single-volume novels at 6s. each (subject to discount) for the\r\nthree-volume editions at 31s. 6d. The preposterous price of 10s. 6d. a\r\nvolume had been adopted during the first popularity of the _Waverly\r\nNovels_, and despite the example of France, where the standard price was\r\n3 fr. 50, had continued in force for the greater part of the century.\r\nEven after novels were sold at reasonable rates artificial prices were\r\nmaintained for books of travel and biographies, so that the circulating\r\nlibraries were practically the only customers for the first editions.\r\n(See PUBLISHING and BOOKSELLING).     (A. W. Po.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] Works especially devoted to these facsimiles are:--Berjeau's\r\n    _Early Dutch, German and English Printers' Marks_ (London, 1866); W.\r\n    Roberts's _Printers' Marks_ (London, 1893); Silvestre's _Marques\r\n    typographiques_ (French; Paris, 1853-1867); _Die Buchermarken oder\r\n    Buchdrucker und Verlegerzeichen_ (Strassburg, 1892-1898), the\r\n    successive parts containing the devices used in Alsace, Italy, Basel,\r\n    Frankfort, Mainz and Cologne; and _Marques typographiques des\r\n    imprimeurs et libraires qui ont exerce dans les Pays-Bas_ (Gand,\r\n    1894). Numerous devices are also reproduced in histories of printing\r\n    and in volumes of facsimiles of early types.\r\n\r\n  [2] An edition of a bull of Pope Pius II. in the John Rylands\r\n    library, Manchester, in types used by Fust and Schoeffer at Mainz,\r\n    bears printed on the top of the first page the words \"Dis ist die bul\r\n    zu dutsch die unser allerheiligster vatter der bapst Pius herusgesant\r\n    hait widder die snoden ungleubigen turcken.\" This is attributed to\r\n    the year 1463, and is claimed as the first book with a printed\r\n    title-page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKBINDING.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Origins.\r\n\r\nBindings or covers to protect written or printed matter have always\r\nfollowed the shapes of the material on which the writing or printing was\r\ndone. Very early inscriptions on rocks or wood needed no coverings, and\r\nthe earliest instances of protective covers are to be found among the\r\nsmaller Assyrian tablets of about the 8th century B.C. These tablets,\r\nwith cuneiform inscriptions recording sales of slaves, loans of money\r\nand small matters generally, are often enclosed in an outer shell of the\r\nsame shape and impressed with a short title. Egyptian papyrus rolls were\r\ngenerally kept in roll form, bound round with papyrus tape and often\r\nsealed with seals of Nile mud; and the rolls in turn were often\r\npreserved in rectangular hollows cut in wood. The next earliest material\r\nto papyrus used for writing upon was tree bark. Bark books, still\r\ncommonly used by uncultured nations, often consisting of collections of\r\nmagical formulae or medical receipts, are generally rolls, folded\r\nbackwards and forwards upon themselves like the sides of a concertina.\r\nAt Pompeii in 1875 several diptychs were found, the wooden leaves\r\nhollowed on the inner sides, filled with blackened wax, and hinged\r\ntogether at the back with leather thongs. Writings were found scratched\r\non the wax, one of them being a record of a payment to Umbricia Januaria\r\nin A.D. 55. This is the earliest known Latin manuscript. The diptychs\r\nare the prototypes of the modern book. From about the 1st to the 6th\r\ncentury, ornamental diptychs were made of carved ivory, and presented to\r\ngreat personages by the Roman consuls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 1.--WINCHESTER DOMESDAY BOOK OF THE 12TH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n    Dark brown morocco, blind stamped.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 2.--ST.

(2) In long\r\nlines each the entire length of the roll. (3) In short lines parallel to\r\nthe length of the roll, each column or page of writing having a space\r\nleft on each side of it. Rolls written in the first of these ways were\r\nsimply rolled up and kept in cylinders of like shape, sometimes several\r\ntogether, with a title tag at the end of each, in a box called a\r\nscrinium. In the case of the second form, the most obvious instances of\r\nwhich are to be found in the Buddhist prayer-wheels, the rolls were and\r\nare kept in circular boxes with handles through the centres so that they\r\ncan revolve easily. In the third manner of arranging the manuscript the\r\npage forms show very clearly, and it is still used in the scrolls of the\r\nlaw in Jewish synagogues, kept on two rollers, one at each end. But this\r\nform of writing also developed a new method for its own more convenient\r\npreservation. A roll of this kind can be folded up, backwards and\r\nforwards, the bend coming in the vacant spaces between the columns of\r\nwriting. When this is done it at once becomes a book, and takes the\r\nChinese and Japanese form known as _orihon_--all the writing on one side\r\nof the roll or strip of paper and all the other side blank. Some books\r\nof this kind are simply guarded by two boards, but generally they are\r\nfastened together along one of the sides, which then becomes the back of\r\nthe book. The earliest fastening of such books consists of a lacing with\r\nsome cord or fibre run through holes stabbed right through the substance\r\nof the roll, near the edge. Now the _orihon_ is complete, and it is the\r\nlink between the roll and the book. This \"stabbed\" form of binding is\r\nthe earliest method of keeping the leaves of a book together; it occurs\r\nin the case of a Coptic papyrus of about the 8th century found at\r\nThebes, but it is rarely used in the case of papyrus, as the material is\r\ntoo brittle to retain the threads properly.\r\n\r\nThe method of folding vellum into pages seems to have been first\r\nfollowed about the 5th century. The sheets were folded once, and\r\ngatherings of four or more folded sheets were made, so that stitches\r\nthrough the fold at the back would hold all the sheets together and each\r\nleaf could be conveniently turned over. Very soon an obvious plan of\r\nfixing several of these gatherings, or quires, together was followed by\r\nthe simple expedient of fastening the threads at the back round a strong\r\nstrip of leather or vellum held at right angles to the line of the\r\nbacks. This early plan of \"sewing\" books is to-day used in the case of\r\nvaluable books; it is known as \"flexible\" work, and has never been\r\nimproved upon.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the method of sewing quires together in this way became well\r\nunderstood, it was found that the projecting bands at the back needed\r\nprotection, so that when all the quires were joined together and, so\r\nfar, finished, strips of leather were fastened all over the back. But it\r\nwas also found that vellum leaves were apt to curl strongly, and to\r\ncounteract this tendency strong wooden boards were put on each side. The\r\nloose ends of the bands were fastened to the boards, which hinged upon\r\nthem, and the protecting strip of leather at the back was drawn over the\r\nboards far enough to cover the hinge. So we get the medieval\r\n\"half-binding\" which shows the strip of leather over the back of the\r\nbook, projecting for a short way over the boards, the rest of which is\r\nleft uncovered. The boards were usually kept closed by means of clasps\r\nin front.\r\n\r\nThe leather strip soon developed, and covered the whole of the boards,\r\n\"whole\" binding as it is called, and it was quickly found that these\r\nfine flat pieces of leather offered a splendid field for artistic\r\ndecoration.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Progress of artistic binding.\r\n\r\nThe first ornamentation on leather bindings was probably made by means\r\nof impressions from small metal points or lines, pressed upon the\r\nleather. This in time led to the purposeful cutting of small decorative\r\nstamps to be used in the same way. It is considered that English binders\r\nexcelled in this art of \"blind\" stamping, that is, without the use of\r\ngold leaf. Most of the stamps were cut intaglio, so that their\r\nimpressions are in cameo form. Such bindings were made to perfection\r\nduring the 12th and 13th centuries at Durham, Oxford, Cambridge, London\r\nand other places. One of the most charming examples left is the binding\r\nof the Winchester Domesday Book of the 12th century (Plate, fig. 1), now\r\nbelonging to the Society of Antiquaries of London.\r\n\r\nFrom about the 7th to the 16th century illuminated manuscripts were held\r\nin the greatest esteem. Among them can be found not only exquisite\r\ncalligraphy but exquisite miniature painting. Moreover, the gorgeousness\r\nof the illuminations inside suggested gorgeousness of the outside\r\ncoverings, so we find splendid work in metals with jewels, enamels and\r\ncarved ivory, dating from the 7th-century _Gospels of Theodolinda_ at\r\nMonza, the Irish cumdach of the _Stowe Missal_, the _Lindau Gospels_ now\r\nin America, and the _Gospels of Charlemagne_ in the Victoria and Albert\r\nMuseum at South Kensington, to the magnificent bindings of 14th-century\r\nLimoges enamel in the British Museum. Such English bindings of this\r\nkind--intrinsically precious--as may have existed have all\r\ndisappeared,--most likely they were melted up by Henry VIII. or Edward\r\nVI.; but at Stonyhurst there is a book known as _St Cuthbert's Gospels_,\r\nwhich is bound in red leather with a repousse design upon it, and is\r\nprobably the work of the 7th or 8th century (Plate, fig. 2).\r\n\r\nWhen printing was introduced into Europe about the middle of the 15th\r\ncentury, there was very soon a reaction against the large, beautiful and\r\nvaluable illuminated MSS. and their equally precious covers. Printing\r\nbrought small books, cheap books, ugly books, generally bound in calf,\r\ngoatskin or sheepskin, and ornamented with large panel stamps in blind.\r\nBut a new art came into birth very shortly, namely the art of gold\r\ntooling on leather, which in capable hands is almost a great art, and\r\nspecimens of the work of the few great masters that have practised it\r\nare now much sought after and likely to increase in estimation and\r\nvalue. All this, as usual, brings a school of skilled _faussaires_ into\r\nthe field, and already the collector of fine bindings must be wary, or\r\nhe may easily give thousands of pounds for forged or made-up objects\r\nthat are worth but little.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of leather bindings with gold tooling, an art which was\r\nprobably brought to Venice from the East, the finest examples are to be\r\nfound in late 15th-century Italian work. The art quickly spread, and\r\nThomas Berthelet, Royal Binder to Henry VIII., seems to have been the\r\nfirst binder who practised it in England. Berthelet's work is strongly\r\nItalian in feeling, especially at first, and it is likely that he was\r\ntaught the new art by an Italian master; he worked until about 1558.\r\n\r\nDuring the late 15th and the 16th century in England, numbers of fine\r\nprinted books were bound in velvet and satin, sometimes set with\r\nenamels, sometimes embroidered. These books, having strong threads of\r\nmetal freely used upon them, have lasted much better than would be\r\nexpected, and instances of such work made for Henry VIII. are still in\r\nexcellent condition, and most decorative.\r\n\r\nThe fashion of ornamenting English royal books with heraldic designs,\r\nwhich is considered to have begun in the reign of Edward IV., has\r\ncontinued without break. The same fashion in books belonging to private\r\nowners was first followed during the later Tudor period, and then\r\nnumbers were made, and have been, more or less, ever since.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole Tudor period several small bindings of gold ornamented\r\nwith enamels were made. Some of these still exist, and they are charming\r\nlittle jewels. They were always provided with a ring at the top, no\r\ndoubt for attaching to the girdle.\r\n\r\nAldus Manutius, the great Venetian printer, had several of his books\r\ncharmingly bound in dark morocco with \"Aldine\" knot leaves and small\r\ndolphins both in blind and gold tooling; and Giunta, a Florentine\r\nprinter, had his books bound in a similar way but without the dolphins.\r\nMany early Venetian bindings have recessed panels, made by the use of\r\ndouble boards, the upper of which is pierced, finished in true oriental\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nJean Grolier, viscount d'Aguisy, treasurer of France in 1545, was a\r\ngreat collector of fine books, most of which were bound for himself, and\r\nbear upon them his legend, _Portio mea domine sit in terra viventium_,\r\nand also his name, Io Grolierii et Amicorum (Plate, fig. 3). Tommaso\r\nMaioli, an Italian collector of about the same time, used the same form\r\nof legend. Books bound for him are curiously marked with atoms of gold\r\nremaining in the irregularities of the leather.\r\n\r\nDemetrio Canevari, physician to Pope Urban VIII., had his books bound in\r\ndark green or deep red morocco, and upon them is a fine cameo stamp with\r\na design of Apollo driving a chariot with one white horse and one black\r\nhorse towards a mountain on which is a silver Pegasus. The stamp was\r\ncoloured, but in most cases the colour has now worn off. Round the stamp\r\nis the legend [Greek: ORTHOS KAI MAE LOXIOS].\r\n\r\nThe Italian bindings which were made for popes and cardinals are always\r\nof much interest and often of high merit, but as a rule later Italian\r\nbindings are disappointing.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey Tory, printer and engraver to Francis I. of France, designed\r\nsome fine bindings, some for himself and quite possibly some for Jean\r\nGrolier.\r\n\r\nFor Henry II. of France much highly decorative work in binding was done,\r\nrichly gilded and coloured. These bindings have upon them the king's\r\ninitials, the initials of his queen, Catherine de' Medici, and the\r\nemblems of crescents and bows. Henry's device was a crescent with the\r\nlegend, _Donec impleat totum orbem_. Bindings of similar style were made\r\nfor Diane de Poitiers, duchesse de Valentinois, with her initials and\r\nthe same devices of crescents and bows. They are always fine work.\r\n\r\nGerman bindings are mostly in pigskin, finely stamped in blind. Several\r\nare, however, in calf. Gilding, when it exists, is generally bad.\r\n\r\nIn England during the 17th century much fine work was done in binding,\r\nmost of it in morocco, but Henry, prince of Wales, always had his books\r\nbound in calf. The Jacobean style is heraldic, with semis of small\r\nstamps and heavy corners, but James I. has left some very fine bindings\r\nin another style (Plate, fig. 4), very possibly done for him by John\r\nGibson, who bound the royal books while James was king of Scotland only.\r\nDuring the reign of Charles I. Nicholas Ferrar founded his curious\r\nestablishment at Little Gidding, and there his niece Mary Collet and her\r\nsisters set up a bindery. They made large scrap-books, harmonies of the\r\nGospels and other parts of the Bible, with illustrations, and bound them\r\nmagnificently in velvet stamped in gold and silver. They were taught by\r\na binder who worked for John and Thomas Buck, printers to the university\r\nof Cambridge, and the Little Gidding stamps are often identical with\r\nBuck's.\r\n\r\nSamuel Mearne (d. 1683) was royal binder to Charles II., and invented\r\nthe cottage style of decoration, a style which has lasted till the\r\npresent day; the Bible on which Edward VII. took the coronation oath was\r\nornamented in that way. An inner rectangle is run parallel to the edges\r\nof the book, and the upper and lower lines are broken outwards into the\r\noutline of a gable roof. Mearne's work as a binder (Plate, fig. 5) is of\r\nthe highest merit. Many of his books have their fore-edge painted in\r\nsuch a way that the work is invisible when the book is shut, and only\r\nshows when the edges are fanned out.\r\n\r\nIn France 16th- and 17th-century binding is distinguished by the work of\r\nsuch masters as Nicholas Eve, who bound the beautiful _Livre des Statuts\r\net Ordonnances de l'ordre du Benvist Sainct Esprit_ for Henry III.\r\n(Plate, fig. 6); Clovis Eve, who is credited with the invention of the\r\nstyle known as \"fanfare,\" a delicate tracery over the boards of a book,\r\nfilled out with spirals of leafy stems; and Le Gascon, who invented the\r\ndotted work which has been used more or less ever since. Le Gascon\r\ncaused his small gilding tools--curves and arabesques--to be scored\r\nacross, so that when impressions were made from them a dotted line\r\nshowed instead of a right line. Florimond Badier worked in a style very\r\nsimilar to that of Le Gascon and sometimes signed his work, which Le\r\nGascon never did. Le Gascon had many imitators, the best and closest\r\nbeing Poncyn and Magnus, Dutch binders who worked at Amsterdam in the\r\n17th century, and his style has been continuously followed to the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nThe bindings of Padeloup le Jeune often have small tickets with his name\r\nupon them; they usually have borders of lace-like gold tooling known as\r\n\"dentelle\" and are often inlaid. He belonged to a family of binders, all\r\nof whom were excellent workmen, and lived in the 17th and 18th\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nThe Deromes were another of the great French families of binders; the\r\nmost celebrated was Nicholas Denis, called \"Le Jeune,\" born in 1731. He\r\nused dentelle borders resembling those of Padeloup, but with little\r\nbirds interspersed among the arabesques--\"dentelles a l'oiseau.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the many French binders of the 18th century who used delicate\r\ninlays of coloured leathers, Jean Charles le Monnier was perhaps the\r\nmost skilled. He often signed his bindings in small capitals impressed\r\nin gold somewhere about the inlaid part.\r\n\r\nEliot and Chapman bound the library of Robert Harley, earl of Oxford,\r\nabout the middle of the 18th century. The bindings are in morocco, with\r\nbroad, richly gold-tooled borders, and usually a diamond-shaped\r\ncentre-piece. This is known as the Harleian style.\r\n\r\nThomas Hollis had his books bound in fine red morocco, ornamented with\r\nsmall, well-cut stamps engraved by Thomas Pingo, the medallist. These\r\nstamps comprise a cap of liberty, a figure of liberty, a figure of\r\nBritannia and several smaller ones.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the 18th century, when binding in England was\r\ndecoratively at a low level, Roger Payne, a native of Windsor, came to\r\nLondon and set up as a bookbinder. He was a splendid workman, and\r\nintroduced richly gold-tooled corner-pieces, ornamental \"doublures\" or\r\ninside linings, and also invented the graining of morocco, graining it,\r\nhowever, in one direction only, known as the \"straight grain.\" It is\r\nsaid that Payne cut his own binding tools of iron; they certainly are\r\nexquisitely made, and in many of his bindings he has put a written\r\ndescription of loving work he has done upon them. Payne was,\r\nunfortunately, a drunkard, but he has in spite of this rendered an\r\nimmortal service to the art of bookbinding in England.\r\n\r\nIn 1785 John Edwards of Halifax patented a method of making vellum\r\ntransparent, and using it as a covering over delicate paintings. He also\r\npainted pictures on the fore-edges of many of his books in the same\r\nmanner as that followed by Samuel Mearne in the 17th century, so that\r\nthey did not show until the book was opened. John Whitaker used calf for\r\nhis bindings, but ornamented the calf in a curious way with strong acids\r\nand with prints from engraved metal plates. Both Edwards and Whitaker\r\nliked classical borders and ornaments, and their bindings are in\r\nconsequence often known as \"Etruscan.\"\r\n\r\nThe main styles used in England at the beginning of the 19th century\r\nwere nothing more than distant imitations of Roger Payne. Kalthoeber,\r\nStaggemeier, Walther and Hering were all disciples of this master, but\r\nCharles Lewis worked on original lines. He developed arabesques and paid\r\nparticular attention to richly gold-tooled doublures. He also used gold\r\nend papers, and the bands at the back of his bindings are often double\r\nand always broad, flat and gold-tooled. His workmanship is excellent; he\r\nworked largely for Thomas Grenville and other great collectors.\r\n\r\nFrench binding of the 19th century is remarkable for wonderful technical\r\nexcellence in every part. Among the most skilled of these admirable\r\nworkmen and artists may be particularly mentioned Thouvenin, Bauzonnet,\r\nLortic, Niedree, Cape and Duru, and fortunately they generally sign\r\ntheir work in small gold lettering either on the back of their bindings\r\nor inside along the lower edge.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Modern methods.\r\n\r\nRecent years have witnessed a marked revival of interest in the art of\r\nbookbinding, but modern binders have two serious difficulties to contend\r\nwith. One of these is the prevalence of bad paper, overladen with clay\r\nand with wood pulp, and also the fact that many of the modern leathers\r\nare badly prepared and dangerously treated with sulphuric acid, which in\r\ntime inevitably rots the fibre. The Society of Arts has appointed\r\ncommittees of experts to report upon both of these evils, and the\r\npublished accounts of both inquiries are of much value, and it is to be\r\nhoped that the results may be beneficial. Concurrently with the revival\r\nof the artistic side of the subject, there has also arisen a remarkable\r\ndevelopment in the technical processes, owing to the invention of\r\ningenious and delicate machinery which is capable of executing the work\r\nwhich had hitherto been always laboriously done by hand. The processes\r\nof folding the printed sheets, and sewing them together on bands,\r\nrounding the backs when sewn, and of making the outer cases, covering\r\nthem with cloth or leather and stamping designs upon them, can now all\r\nbe efficiently executed by means of machines. The saving in time and\r\nlabour thus effected is very great, although it must be said that the\r\nold methods of carrying out the process of sewing and rounding the backs\r\nof books by hand labour were safer and stronger, as well as being much\r\nless liable to bruise and injure the paper. These processes\r\nunfortunately are not only slow but also necessitate highly skilled\r\nlabour. Already the larger trade binders utilize machines extensively\r\nand advantageously, but exclusively high-class trade binders do not as\r\nyet materially depart from the older methods. Private binders have\r\nnaturally no reason to use machines at all. Fine and delicate examples\r\nof large metal blocks or dies have been very successfully used for the\r\ndecoration of covers measuring about 11-1/2 by 8 in.\r\n\r\nBesides the large trade binders working mainly by the help of machinery,\r\nand producing a great quantity of bound work which is not expected to\r\nlast long, there also exists in London, Paris, New York and other large\r\ncities, a small class of art binders who work throughout upon the\r\nprinciples which have been continuously in use for first-class work ever\r\nsince about the 5th century. The initial impetus to this school can be\r\ntraced to William Morris, who himself made some beautiful designs for\r\nbookbindings, to be executed both in gold and in blind. Although he\r\nprobably did not fully appreciate either the peculiar limitations or the\r\npossibilities of the art of gold-tooling on leather, nevertheless his\r\ngenius guided him truly as to the spirit in which the designs should be\r\nconceived. The revived art soon reached its first stage of development\r\nunder the guidance of Mr T.J. Cobden-Sanderson, who may fairly be\r\nconsidered as the founder of the modern school of design for\r\ngold-tooling on book-covers, the pre-eminence and individuality of his\r\nwork in this direction being proved by the number of his imitators.\r\nAmong the most successful of his pupils is Mr Douglas Cockerell, whose\r\nwork (Plate, fig. 7) is distinguished by a marked originality of\r\ntreatment, while it shows a scholarly appreciation of ancient methods.\r\nMr Alfred de Sauty has succeeded in developing a new and admirable style\r\nin inlaid leathers, combined with delicate pointille work. A number of\r\nwomen artists, both in England and in America, have already discovered\r\nin bookbinding a fitting and lucrative field for their energies. One,\r\nMiss Sarah Prideaux, is not only skilled and original in her own work,\r\nbut she has also given us much valuable literature on her subject. Miss\r\nE.M. MacColl may claim to be the inventor of the small curved gold line\r\nproduced by means of a tiny wheel, for though the possibility of\r\nproducing such a line in blind was known for a long time, it was rarely\r\nused. The graceful curves and lines found on Miss MacColl's work have\r\nbeen designed for her by her brother, Mr D.S. MacColl (Plate, fig. 8).\r\nMiss Joanna Birkenruth recalls the highly decorative medieval binding by\r\nher use of jewels cut _en cabochon_, but set in morocco instead of gold\r\nor silver, and there are many others who are working well and earnestly\r\nat art binding with delicate skill and taste. Outside the inner circle\r\nof professional bookbinders there has grown up a new profession, that of\r\nthe designer for pictorial book-covers, especially those intended to be\r\nshown in colour on cloth or paper. Among notable designers may be\r\nmentioned Lewis F. Day, A.A. Turbayne, Walter Crane and Charles\r\nRicketts.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Book-sewing Machine.]\r\n\r\n  _Machine-binding._--The principal types of machine for commercial\r\n  binding are described below. They are almost all due to American or\r\n  German ingenuity. It may be noted that, while books sewn by hand on\r\n  bands have the loose ends of the bands actually drawn through the\r\n  boards and strongly fastened to them through their substance, no\r\n  machines for covering sewn books will do this so effectively. All they\r\n  will do as a rule is to paste down to the inner surfaces of the boards\r\n  the loose ends of the tapes on which the sewing is done. So that,\r\n  although it may last a long time if not much used, a \"cased\" book is\r\n  likely to slip out of its cover as soon as the paste fixing it\r\n  perishes. Modern bookbinding machines of all kinds are usually driven\r\n  by power, and in consequence of the necessary setting of most of them\r\n  accurately to some particular size of book, they are not suitable for\r\n  binding books of different sizes; the full advantage of them can only\r\n  be taken where there is a large edition of one book.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sewing.\r\n\r\n  Book-sewing machines (fig. 9) are of two kinds one sews the books on\r\n  bands, either flat or round, and the other supplies the place of bands\r\n  by a kind of chain stitch. The band-working machines bring the return\r\n  thread back by pulling it through the upper and lower edges of the\r\n  back of each section, thereby to some extent weakening each section,\r\n  but at the same time this weakening can be to some extent neutralized\r\n  by careful head-banding. The other system, where the band is replaced\r\n  by a chain stitch, brings back the return thread inside each section;\r\n  the objection to this is that there is a flattening out of the back of\r\n  the book, which becomes a difficulty when the subsequent operation of\r\n  covering the book begins. The sections are sewn continuously in a long\r\n  line, and are afterwards cut apart. The threads catch into hooked\r\n  needles and are drawn through holes made by piercers set to a certain\r\n  distance; a shuttle like that used in an ordinary sewing-machine sews\r\n  the inner thread backwards and forwards. Each section is placed upon a\r\n  sort of metal saddle by the hand of the operator, one after the other,\r\n  the machine working continuously unless the action is cut off or\r\n  controlled by a foot-lever or pedal. This machine is much quieter to\r\n  work, and although the inner threads are too bulky to be quite\r\n  satisfactory, this is not a serious matter like the cutting of the\r\n  upper and lower edges of the back already described, and, moreover, is\r\n  probably capable of being either improved away or so minimized that it\r\n  will become of small importance.\r\n\r\n  The Martini book-sewing machine, which sews books on tape without\r\n  cutting up head or tail--a most important improvement--and also forms\r\n  complete Kettle stitches, will sew books of any size up to 18 in. The\r\n  needles are straight, and the necessary adjustments for various sizes\r\n  of books are very simple.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Rounding and backing.\r\n\r\n  The machine for rounding and backing sewn books requires a rather\r\n  elaborate and very careful setting of several parts to the exact\r\n  requirement of each size to be worked. The sewn book with the back\r\n  glued is caught in a clip and forced between two tight rollers, the\r\n  result being that the hitherto flat back is automatically turned into\r\n  a rounded shape (figs. 10 and 11). The book is then drawn forward, by\r\n  a continuance of the onward movement, until it reaches the rounding\r\n  plate, which is a block of steel with a polished groove a little\r\n  larger than the size required. This rounding plate moves within a\r\n  small arc by means of heavy counter-weights, and on the back of the\r\n  book being strongly pressed against it, it receives the permanent form\r\n  of the groove cut in it, at the same time a strong grip on each side\r\n  of the book causes the ledge to rise up along each outer edge of the\r\n  back. This ledge it is which enables the boards to be subsequently\r\n  fixed in such a way as to hinge on a line outside the actual and\r\n  natural boundary of the book. Before the discovery of the possibility\r\n  of producing this ledge, the boards of books hinged upon a line\r\n  coincident with the inner edges of the back, the result of which was\r\n  that when the book was opened there was an invariable tendency to open\r\n  and pull away the few outer sections of the paper or vellum itself--a\r\n  destructive and disagreeable peculiarity. These machines are capable,\r\n  after they are properly set, of rounding and backing about 750 volumes\r\n  of the same size within an hour.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 10.--Section of back of book sewn on bands.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 11.--Section of same book after it has passed\r\n  through the machine for rounding and backing.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Case-making Machine.]\r\n\r\n  The machine for making cases, or \"case\" covers (fig. 12), for books is\r\n  large and complicated, but beautifully effective. It contains\r\n  altogether over fifty springs, some of which are very small, like\r\n  watch fittings, while others are large and powerful. The machine is\r\n  fed with pieces of cardboard cut exactly to the sizes of the required\r\n  boards, other pieces cut to the size of the back, and a long roll of\r\n  the cloth with which the cases are to be covered, and when set working\r\n  the roll of cloth is gradually unwound and glued by contact with a\r\n  roller, which is drawn along until it reaches a point where the two\r\n  boards are ingeniously dropped upon it one by one, then on again to\r\n  where a long arm swings backwards and forwards, at each movement\r\n  picking up a piece of cardboard for the back and placing it gently\r\n  exactly upon the glued bed left for it between the two boards already\r\n  fixed. Next, as the cloth passes along, it comes under the sharp\r\n  influence of two rectangular gouges which cut out the corners, the\r\n  remaining side pieces being gradually but irresistibly turned up by\r\n  hollow raisers and flattened down by small rollers, a very delicate\r\n  piece of machinery finishing the corners in a masterly way. Then,\r\n  lastly, an arrangement of raisers and rollers acting at right angles\r\n  to the last mentioned turn over and press out the remaining pieces of\r\n  cloth. Of course each piece of cloth is cut across at the proper point\r\n  before the turning up begins. This machine is capable of producing\r\n  1200 cases in an hour of any size that the machine will take.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Smyth Casing-in Machine.\r\n\r\n    A. Cases.\r\n    B.

When in 2nd position the book\r\n      drops to level of paste box.]\r\n\r\n  The Smyth casing-in machine (fig. 13) pastes the sides of a book as\r\n  required and then attaches the cover over all. Cleverly arranged\r\n  rollers catch the book, and by a carefully regulated pressure fix the\r\n  cover in the proper position. There is a \"jointing-in\" device which at\r\n  a critical moment forces the joints in the cover into the joints in\r\n  the book. It will work books from 4 to 22 in. in length and from 1/4\r\n  to 3 in. in thickness, and can cover from 10 to 15 books per minute.\r\n\r\n  Here may also be mentioned the Sheridan wrappering machine, which\r\n  covers magazines and pamphlets ranging from 5 to 12 in. in length at\r\n  the rate of 40 a minute.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Wiring.\r\n\r\n  Wiring is a cheap method of keeping together thin parts of periodicals\r\n  or tracts. The machine that executes it is simple in construction and\r\n  use. It drives a short wire pin, bent at right angles at each end,\r\n  through the folds of the sections of a book or through the entire\r\n  thickness, sideways, after the manner of stabbing. The projecting\r\n  ends, when through the substance of the paper, are bent over and\r\n  flattened so as to grip firmly. The metal used for these pins was at\r\n  first very liable to rust, and consequently did much damage to the\r\n  paper near it, but this defect has now been largely remedied. At the\r\n  same time the principle of using hard metal wire instead of flexible\r\n  hempen thread is essentially vicious, and should only be used as a\r\n  temporary expedient for publications of little value.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Blocking.\r\n\r\n  The machines (fig. 14) now used for blocking designs upon book-covers\r\n  are practically the same as have been employed for many years. Several\r\n  small improvements have been introduced as to better inking of the\r\n  rollers for colour work, and better heating of the blocks used for\r\n  gold work. A blocking press is now, in consequence of the size of many\r\n  of the blocks, a large and cumbersome machine. The block itself is\r\n  fixed firmly in a strong metal bed, and a movable table in front of it\r\n  is fitted with gauges which keep the cover exactly in its right place.\r\n  For gold work the block is kept at the proper temperature by means of\r\n  gas jets, and the cover being properly overlaid with gold leaf is\r\n  passed, on its table, directly under the block and then pressed\r\n  steadily upwards against it, lowered, drawn out, and the superfluous\r\n  gold rubbed off. The same process is followed in the case of colour\r\n  blocks, only now the block need not be heated, but is inked by means\r\n  of a roller for each impression. A separate printing is necessary for\r\n  each colour. These printings always require great care on the part of\r\n  the operator, who has to watch the working of each pull very\r\n  carefully, and if any readjustment is wanted, to make it at once, so\r\n  that it is difficult to estimate at what rate they can be made. In the\r\n  matter of gold blocking there must be great care exercised in the\r\n  matter of the heat of the block, for if it is too hot the gold will\r\n  adhere where it is not wanted, and if too cool it will not adhere\r\n  where it is required. Great nicety is also necessary as to the exact\r\n  pressure required as well as the precise number of moments during\r\n  which the block should be in contact with the gold, which is fastened\r\n  to the cloth or leather by means of the solidification by heat of egg\r\n  albumen. Blocking presses are mainly of German make, but Scottish and\r\n  English presses are also largely used.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Blocking Machine.]\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--See the _Anglo-Saxon Review_ (1899-1901); C.J.\r\n  Davenport, _Royal English Bookbindings_ (1896), _Cantor Lectures on\r\n  Bookbinding_ (1898), _English Embroidered Bookbindings_ (1899), _Life\r\n  of Thomas Berthelet_ (1901), _Life of Samuel Mearne_ (1906); W.Y.\r\n  Fletcher, _English Bookbindings in the British Museum_ (1895),\r\n  _Foreign Bookbindings in the British Museum_ (1896); L.

D.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKCASE, an article of furniture, forming a shelved receptacle, usually\r\nperpendicular or horizontal, for the storage of books. When books, being\r\nwritten by hand, were excessively scarce, they were kept in small\r\ncoffers which the great carried about with them on their journeys. As\r\nmanuscript volumes accumulated in the religious houses or in regal\r\npalaces, they were stored upon shelves or in cupboards, and it is from\r\nthese cupboards that the bookcase of to-day directly descends. At a\r\nsomewhat later date the doors were, for convenience' sake, discarded,\r\nand the evolution of the bookcase made one step forward. Even then,\r\nhowever, the volumes were not arranged in the modern fashion. They were\r\neither placed in piles upon their sides, or if upright, were ranged with\r\ntheir backs to the wall and their edges outwards. The band of leather,\r\nvellum or parchment which closed the book was often used for the\r\ninscription of the title, which was thus on the fore-edge instead of on\r\nthe back. It was not until the invention of printing had greatly\r\ncheapened books that it became the practice to write the title on the\r\nback and place the edges inwards. Early bookcases were usually of oak,\r\nwhich is still deemed to be the most appropriate wood for a stately\r\nlibrary. The oldest bookcases in England are those in the Bodleian\r\nlibrary at Oxford, which were placed in position in the last year or two\r\nof the 16th century; in that library are the earliest extant examples of\r\nshelved galleries over the flat wall-cases. Long ranges of book-shelves\r\nare necessarily somewhat severe in appearance, and many attempts have\r\nbeen made by means of carved cornices and pilasters to give them a more\r\n_riant_ appearance--attempts which were never so successful as in the\r\nhands of the great English cabinet-makers of the second half of the 18th\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nBoth Chippendale and Sheraton made or designed great numbers of\r\nbookcases, mostly glazed with little lozenges encased in fret-work\r\nframes often of great charm and elegance. The alluring grace of some of\r\nSheraton's satinwood bookcases has very rarely indeed been equalled. The\r\nFrench cabinet-makers of the same period were also highly successful\r\nwith small ornamental cases. Mahogany, rosewood, satinwood and even\r\nchoicer exotic timbers were used; they were often inlaid with\r\nmarqueterie and mounted with chased and gilded bronze. Dwarf bookcases\r\nwere frequently finished with a slab of choice marble at the top. In the\r\ngreat public libraries of the 20th century the bookcases are often of\r\niron, as in the British Museum where the shelves are covered with\r\ncowhide, of steel, as in the library of Congress at Washington, or of\r\nslate, as in the Fitzwilliam library at Cambridge. There are three\r\nsystems of arranging bookcases--flat against the wall; in \"stacks\" or\r\nranges parallel to each other with merely enough space between to allow\r\nof the passage of a librarian; or in bays or alcoves where cases jut out\r\ninto the room at right angles to the wall-cases. The stack system is\r\nsuitable only for public libraries where economy of space is essential;\r\nthe bay system is not only handsome but utilizes the space to great\r\nadvantage. The library of the city of London at the Guildhall is a\r\npeculiarly effective example of the bay arrangement.\r\n\r\n  The whole question of the construction and arrangement of bookcases\r\n  was learnedly discussed in the light of experience by W.E. Gladstone\r\n  in the Nineteenth Century for March 1890.     (J. P.-B.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK-COLLECTING, the bringing together of books which in their contents,\r\ntheir form or the history of the individual copy possess some element of\r\npermanent interest, and either actually or prospectively are rare, in\r\nthe sense of being difficult to procure. This qualification of rarity,\r\nwhich figures much too largely in the popular view of book-collecting,\r\nis entirely subordinate to that of interest, for the rarity of a book\r\ndevoid of interest is a matter of no concern. On the other hand so long\r\nas a book (or anything else) is and appears likely to continue to be\r\neasily procurable at any moment, no one has any reason for collecting\r\nit. The anticipation that it will always be easily procurable is often\r\nunfounded; but so long as the anticipation exists it restrains\r\ncollecting, with the result that Horn-books are much rarer than First\r\nFolio Shakespeares. It has even been laid down that the ultimate rarity\r\nof books varies in the inverse ratio of the number of copies originally\r\nprinted, and though the generalization is a little sweeping, it is not\r\nfar from the truth. To triumph over small difficulties being the chief\r\nelement in games of skill, the different varieties of book-collecting,\r\nwhich offer almost as many varieties of grades of difficulty, make\r\nexcellent hobbies. But in its essence the pastime of a book-collector is\r\nidentical with the official work of the curator of a museum, and thus\r\nalso with one branch of the duties of the librarian of any library of\r\nrespectable age. In its inception every library is a literary workshop,\r\nwith more or less of a garden or recreation ground attached according as\r\nits managers are influenced by the humanities or by a narrow conception\r\nof utility. As the library grows, the books and editions which have been\r\nthe tools of one generation pass out of use; and it becomes largely a\r\ndepository or storehouse of a stock much of which is dead. But from out\r\nof this seemingly dead stock preserved at haphazard, critics and\r\nantiquaries gradually pick out books which they find to be still alive.\r\nOf some of these the interest cannot be reproduced in its entirety by\r\nany mere reprint, and it is this salvage which forms the literary\r\nmuseum. Book-collectors are privileged to leap at once to this stage in\r\ntheir relations with books, using the dealers' shops and catalogues as\r\ndepositories from which to pick the books which will best fit with the\r\naim or central idea of their collection. For in the modern private\r\ncollection, as in the modern museum, the need for a central idea must be\r\nfully recognized. Neither the collector nor the curator can be content\r\nto keep a mere curiosity-shop. It is the collector's business to\r\nillustrate his central idea by his choice of examples, by the care with\r\nwhich he describes them and the skill with which they are arranged. In\r\nall these matters many amateurs rival, if they do not outstrip, the\r\nprofessional curators and librarians, and not seldom their collections\r\nare made with a view to their ultimate transference to public ownership.\r\nIn any case it is by the zeal of collectors that books which otherwise\r\nwould have perished from neglect are discovered, cared for and\r\npreserved, and those who achieve these results certainly deserve well of\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\n\r\n  History.\r\n\r\nWhenever a high degree of civilization has been attained book-lovers\r\nhave multiplied, and to the student with his modest desire to read his\r\nfavourite author in a well-written or well-printed copy there has been\r\nadded a class of owners suspected of caring more for the externals of\r\nbooks than for the enjoyment to be obtained by reading them. But\r\nalthough adumbrations of it existed under the Roman empire and towards\r\nthe end of the middle ages, book-collecting, as it is now understood, is\r\nessentially of modern growth. A glance through what must be regarded as\r\nthe medieval text-book on the love of books, the _Philobiblon_,\r\nattributed to Richard de Bury (written in 1345), shows that it deals\r\nalmost exclusively with the delights of literature, and Sebastian\r\nBrant's attack on the book-fool, written a century and a half later,\r\ndemonstrates nothing more than that the possession of books is a poor\r\nsubstitute for learning. This is so obviously true that before\r\nbook-collecting in the modern sense can begin it is essential that there\r\nshould be no lack of books to read, just as until cups and saucers\r\nbecame plentiful there was no room for the collector of old china. Even\r\nwhen the invention of printing had reduced the cost of books by some\r\n80%, book-collectors did not immediately appear. There is a natural\r\ntemptation to imagine that the early book-owners, whose libraries have\r\nenriched modern collectors with some of their best-known treasures, must\r\nnecessarily have been collectors themselves. This is far from being the\r\ncase. Hardly a book of all that Jean Grolier (1479-1565) caused to be\r\nbound so tastefully for himself and his friends reveals any antiquarian\r\ninstincts in its liberal owner, who bought partly to encourage the best\r\nprinters of his day, partly to provide his friends with the most recent\r\nfruits of Renaissance scholarship. In England Archbishop Cranmer, Lords\r\nArundel and Lumley, and Henry, prince of Wales (1594-1612), in France\r\nthe famous historian Jacques Auguste de Thou (1553-1617), brought\r\ntogether the best books of their day in all departments of learned\r\nliterature, put them into handsome leather jackets, and enriched them\r\nwith their coats of arms, heraldic badges or other marks of possession.\r\nBut they brought their books together for use and study, to be read by\r\nthemselves and by the scholars who frequented their houses, and no\r\nevidence has been produced that they appreciated what a collector might\r\nnow call the points of a book other than its fine condition and literary\r\nor informational merits. Again, not a few other more or less famous men\r\nhave been dubbed collectors on the score of a scanty shelf-full of\r\nvolumes known to have been stamped with their arms. Collecting, as\r\ndistinct both from the formation of working libraries and from casual\r\nownership of this latter kind, may perhaps be said to have begun in\r\nEngland at the time of the antiquarian reaction produced by the\r\nbook-massacres when the monasteries were dissolved by Henry VIII., and\r\nthe university and college libraries and the parish service books were\r\nplundered and stript by the commissioners of Edward VI. To rescue good\r\nbooks from perishing is one of the main objects of book-collecting, and\r\nwhen Archbishop Parker and Sir Robert Cotton set to work to gather what\r\nthey could of the scattered records of English statecraft and\r\nliterature, and of the decorative art bestowed so lavishly on the books\r\nof public and private devotion, they were book-collectors in a sense and\r\non a scale to which few of their modern imitators can pretend. Men of\r\nmore slender purses, and armed with none of Archbishop Parker's special\r\npowers, worked according to their ability on similar lines. Humphrey\r\nDyson, an Elizabethan notary, who collected contemporary proclamations\r\nand books from the early English presses, and George Thomason (d. 1666),\r\nthe bookseller who bought, stored and catalogued all the pamphlet\r\nliterature of the Civil War, were mindful of the future historians of\r\nthe days in which they lived. By the end of the 17th century\r\nbook-collecting was in full swing all over Europe, and much of its\r\napparatus had come into existence. In 1676 book auctions were introduced\r\ninto England from Holland, and soon we can trace in priced catalogues\r\nthe beginning of a taste for Caxtons, and the books prized by collectors\r\nslowly fought their way up from amid the heavy volumes of theology by\r\nwhich they were at first overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nWhile book-collecting thus came into existence it was rather as an added\r\ngrace in the formation of a fine library than as a separate pursuit.\r\nAlmost all the large book-buyers of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries\r\nbought with a public object, or were rewarded for their zeal by their\r\ntreasures being thought worthy of a public resting-place. Sir Thomas\r\nSmith (d. 1577) bequeathed his books to Queens' College, Cambridge;\r\nArchbishop Parker's were left under severe restrictions to Corpus\r\nChristi College in the same university; Sir Thomas Bodley refounded\r\nduring his lifetime the university library at Oxford, to which also Laud\r\ngave liberally and Selden bequeathed his books. The library of\r\nArchbishop Williams went to St John's College, Cambridge; that of\r\nArchbishop Usher was bought for Trinity College, Dublin. The\r\nmathematical and scientific books of Thomas Howard, earl of Norfolk (d.\r\n1646), were given by his grandson to the Royal Society; the heraldic\r\ncollections of Ralph Sheldon (d. 1684) to Heralds' College; the library\r\nin which Pepys took so much pleasure to Magdalene College, Cambridge.\r\nBishop Moore's books, including a little volume of Caxton quartos,\r\nalmost all unique, were bought by George I. and presented to the\r\nuniversity library at Cambridge. Archbishop Marsh, who had previously\r\nbought Stillingfleet's printed books (his manuscripts went to Oxford),\r\nfounded a library at Dublin. The immense accumulations of Thomas\r\nRawlinson (d. 1725) provided materials for a series of auctions, and\r\nHarley's printed books were sold to Osbourne the bookseller. But the\r\ntrend was all towards public ownership. While Richard Rawlinson (d.\r\n1755) allowed his brother's books to be sold, the best of his own were\r\nbequeathed to Oxford, and the Harleian MSS. were offered to the nation\r\nat a sum far below their value. A similar offer of the great collections\r\nformed by Sir Hans Sloane, including some 50,000 printed books, together\r\nwith the need for taking better care of what remained of the Cotton\r\nmanuscripts, vested in trustees for public use in 1702 and partially\r\ndestroyed by fire in 1731, led to the foundation of the British Museum\r\nin 1753, and this on its opening in 1757 was almost immediately enriched\r\nby George II.'s gift of the old royal library, formed by the kings and\r\nqueens of England from Henry VII. to Charles II., and by Henry, prince\r\nof Wales, son of James I., who had bought the books belonging to\r\nArchbishop Cranmer and Lords Arundel and Lumley. A few notable\r\nbook-buyers could not afford to bequeath their treasures to libraries,\r\ne.g. Richard Smith, the secondary of the Poultry Compter (d. 1675), at\r\nwhose book-sale (1682) a dozen Caxtons sold for from 2 S. to 18 S.\r\napiece, Dr Francis Bernard (d. 1698), Narcissus Luttrell(d. 1732) and Dr\r\nRichard Mead (d. 1754). At the opposite end of the scale, in the earls\r\nof Sunderland (d. 1722) and Pembroke (d. 1733), we have early examples\r\nof the attempts, seldom successful, of book-loving peers to make their\r\nlibraries into permanent heirlooms. But as has been said, the drift up\r\nto 1760 was all towards public ownership, and the libraries were for the\r\nmost part general in character, though the interest in typographical\r\nantiquities was already well marked.\r\n\r\nWhen George III. came to the throne he found himself bookless, and the\r\nmagnificent library of over 80,000 books and pamphlets and 440\r\nmanuscripts which he accumulated shows on a large scale the catholic and\r\nliterary spirit of the book-lovers of his day. As befitted the library\r\nof an English king it was rich in English classics as well as in those\r\nof Greece and Rome, and the typographical first-fruits of Mainz, Rome\r\nand Venice were balanced by numerous works from the first presses of\r\nWestminster, London and Oxford. This noble library passed in 1823 to the\r\nBritish Museum, which had already received the much smaller but\r\ncarefully chosen collection of the Rev. C.M. Cracherode (d. 1799), and\r\nin 1846 was further enriched by the wonderful library formed by Thomas\r\nGrenville, the last of its great book-loving benefactors, who died in\r\nthat year, aged ninety-one. A few less wealthy men had kept up the old\r\npublic-spirited tradition during George III.'s reign, Garrick\r\nbequeathing his fine collection of English plays and Sir Joseph Banks\r\nhis natural history books to the British Museum, while Capell's\r\nShakespearian treasures enriched Trinity College, Cambridge, and those\r\nof Malone went to the Bodleian library at Oxford, the formation of these\r\nspecial collections, in place of the large general library with a\r\nsprinkling of rarities, being in itself worth noting. But the noble\r\nbook-buyers celebrated by the Rev. Thomas Frognall Dibdin in his\r\nnumerous bibliographical works kept mainly on the old lines, though with\r\naims less patriotic than their predecessors. The duke of Roxburghe's\r\nbooks were sold in 1812, and the excitement produced by the auction,\r\nmore especially by the competition between Lord Spencer and the duke of\r\nMarlborough (at that time marquess of Blandford) for an edition of\r\nBoccaccio printed by Valdarfer at Venice in 1471, led to the formation\r\nof the Roxburghe Club at a commemorative dinner. In 1819 the duke of\r\nMarlborough's books were sold, and the Boccaccio for which he had paid\r\nL2260 went to Earl Spencer (d. 1834) for L750, to pass with the rest of\r\nhis rare books to Mrs Rylands in 1892, and by her gift to the John\r\nRylands library at Manchester in 1899. The books of Sir M.M. Sykes were\r\nsold in 1824, those of J.B. Inglis in 1826 (after which he collected\r\nagain) and those of George Hibbert in 1829. The 150,000 volumes brought\r\ntogether by Richard Heber at an expense of about L100,000 were disposed\r\nof by successive sales during the years 1834-1837 and realized not much\r\nmore than half their cost. The wonderful library of William Beckford (d.\r\n1844), especially rich in fine bindings, bequeathed to his daughter, the\r\nduchess of Hamilton, was sold in 1882, with the Hamilton manuscripts,\r\nfor the most part to the German government. Their dispersal was preceded\r\nin 1881 by that of the Sunderland collection, already mentioned. The\r\nlibrary of Brian Fairfax (d. 1749), which had passed to the earls of\r\nJersey, was sold in 1885, that of Sir John Thorold (d. 1815) in 1884,\r\nhis \"Gutenberg\" Bible fetching L3900 and his Mainz Psalter L4950. The\r\ngreat collection of manuscripts formed by Sir Thomas Phillipps (d. 1872)\r\nhas furnished materials for numerous sales. The printed books of the\r\nearl of Ashburnham (d. 1878) kept the auctioneers busy in 1897 and 1898;\r\nhis manuscripts were sold, some to the British government (the Stowe\r\ncollection shared between the British Museum and Dublin), the German\r\ngovernment (part of the Libri and Barrois collection, all, save one MS.\r\nof 13th century German ballads, resold to France), the Italian\r\ngovernment (the rest of the Libri collection) Mr Yates Thompson (the\r\nMSS. known as the Appendix) and Mr J. Pierpont Morgan (the Lindau\r\nGospels). The collections formed by Mr W.H. Miller (d. 1848, mainly\r\nEnglish poetry), the duke of Devonshire (d. 1858) and Mr Henry Huth (d.\r\n1878), are still intact.\r\n\r\nAmong the book-buyers of the reign of George III., John Ratcliffe, an\r\nex-coal-merchant, and James West had devoted themselves specially to\r\nCaxtons (of which the former possessed 48 and the latter 34) and the\r\nproducts of other early English presses. The collections of Capell and\r\nGarrick were also small and homogeneous. Each section, moreover, of some\r\nof the great libraries that have just been enumerated might fairly be\r\nconsidered a collection in itself, the union of several collections in\r\nthe same library being made possible by the wealth of their purchaser\r\nand the small prices fetched by most classes of books in comparison with\r\nthose which are now paid. But perhaps the modern cabinet theory of\r\nbook-collecting was first carried out with conspicuous skill by Henry\r\nPerkins (d. 1855), whose 865 fine manuscripts and specimens of early\r\nprinting, when sold in 1870, realized nearly L26,000. If surrounded by a\r\nsufficient quantity of general literature the collection might not have\r\nseemed noticeably different from some of those already mentioned, but\r\nthe growing cost of books, together with difficulties as to house-room,\r\ncombined to discourage miscellaneous buying on a large scale, and what\r\nhas been called the \"cabinet\" theory of collecting, so well carried out\r\nby Henry Perkins, became increasingly popular among book buyers, alike\r\nin France, England and the United States of America. Henri Beraldi, in\r\nhis catalogue of his own collection (printed 1892), has described how in\r\nFrance a little band of book-loving amateurs grew up who laughed at the\r\n_bibliophile de la vieille roche_ as they disrespectfully called their\r\npredecessors, and prided themselves on the unity and compactness of\r\ntheir own treasures. In place of the miscellaneous library in which\r\nevery class of book claimed to be represented, and which needed a\r\nspecial room or gallery to house it, they aimed at small collections\r\nwhich should epitomize the owner's tastes and require nothing bulkier\r\nthan a neat bookcase or cabinet to hold them. The French bibliophiles\r\nwhom M. Beraldi celebrated applied this theory with great success to\r\ncollecting the dainty French illustrated books of the 18th century which\r\nwere their especial favourites. In England Richard Fisher treated his\r\nfine examples of early book-illustration as part of his collection of\r\nengravings, etchings and woodcuts (illustrated catalogue printed 1879),\r\nand Frederick Locker (Locker-Lampson) formed in two small bookcases such\r\na gathering of first editions of English imaginative literature that the\r\nmere catalogue of it (printed in 1886) produced the effect of a stately\r\nand picturesque procession. Some of the book-hoards of previous\r\ngenerations could have spared the equivalent of the Locker collection\r\nwithout seeming noticeably the poorer, but the compactness and unity of\r\nthis small collection, in which every book appears to have been bought\r\nfor a special reason and to form an integral part of the whole, gave it\r\nan artistic individuality which was a pleasant triumph for its owner,\r\nand excited so much interest among American admirers of Mr Locker's\r\npoetry that it may be said to have set a fashion. As another example of\r\nthe value of a small collection, both for delight and for historical and\r\nartistic study, mention may be made of the little roomful of manuscripts\r\nand incunabula which William Morris brought together to illustrate the\r\nhistory of the bookish arts in the middle ages before the Renaissance\r\nintroduced new ideals. Many living collectors are working in a similar\r\nspirit, and as this spirit spreads the monotony of the old libraries, in\r\nwhich the same editions of the same books recurred with wearisome\r\nfrequency, should be replaced by much greater individuality and variety.\r\nMoreover, if they can be grouped round some central idea cheap books may\r\nyield just as good sport to the collector as expensive ones, and the\r\ncollector of quite modern works may render admirable service to\r\nposterity. The only limitation is against books specially manufactured\r\nto attract him, or artificially made rare. A quite wholesome interest in\r\ncontemporary first editions was brought to nought about 1889 by the\r\nbooksellers beginning to hoard copies of Browning's _Asolando_ and Mr\r\nLang's _Blue Fairy Book_ on the day of publication, while a graceful but\r\nquite minor poet was made ridiculous by L100 being asked for a set of\r\nhis privately printed _opuscula_. The petty gambling in books printed\r\nat the Kelmscott and Doves' presses, and in the fine paper copies of a\r\ncertain _Life of Queen Victoria_, for which a premium of 250% was asked\r\nbefore publication, is another proof that until the manufacturing stage\r\nis over collecting cannot safely begin. But with this exception the\r\nfield is open, and the 19th century offers as good a hunting ground as\r\nany of its predecessors.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Objects and methods.\r\n\r\nWhile book-collecting may thus take an endless variety of forms the\r\nheads under which these may be grouped are few and fairly easily\r\ndefined. They may be here briefly indicated together with some notes as\r\nto the literature which has grown up round them. The development which\r\nbibliographical literature has taken is indeed very significant of the\r\nchanged ideals of collectors. Brunet's _Manuel du libraire_, first\r\npublished in 1810, attained its fifth edition in 1860-1864, and has\r\nnever since been re-edited (supplement, 1878-1880). The _Bibliographer's\r\nManual of English Literature_ by W.T. Lowndes, first published in 1834,\r\nwas revised by H.G. Bohn in 1857-1864, and of this also no further\r\nedition has been printed. These two works between them gave all the\r\ninformation the old-fashioned collectors required, the _Tresor de livres\r\nrares et precieux_ by J.G.T. Graesse (Dresden, 1859-1867, supplementary\r\nvolume in 1869) adding little to the information given by Brunet. The\r\nday of the omnivorous collector being past, the place of these general\r\nmanuals has been taken by more detailed bibliographies and handbooks on\r\nspecial books, and though new editions of both Lowndes and Brunet would\r\nbe useful to librarians and booksellers no publisher has had the courage\r\nto produce them.\r\n\r\nTo attract a collector a book must appeal to his eye, his mind or his\r\nimagination, and many famous books appeal to all three. A book may be\r\nbeautiful by virtue of its binding, its illustrations or the simple\r\nperfection and harmony of its print and paper. The attraction of a fine\r\nbinding has always been felt in France, the high prices quoted for\r\nElzevirs and French first editions being often due much more to their\r\n17th and 18th century jackets than to the books themselves. The\r\nappreciation of old bindings has greatly increased in England since the\r\nexhibition of them at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1891 (illustrated\r\ncatalogue printed the same year), English blind stamped bindings,\r\nembroidered bindings, and bindings attributable to Samuel Mearne\r\n(_temp._ Charles II.) being much more sought after than formerly. (See\r\nBOOKBINDING.)\r\n\r\nIllustrated books of certain periods are also much in request, and with\r\nthe exception of a few which early celebrity has prevented becoming rare\r\nhave increased inordinately in price. The primitive woodcuts in\r\nincunabula are now almost too highly appreciated, and while the\r\n_Nuremburg Chronicle_ (1493) seldom fetches more than L30 or the\r\n_Hypnerotomachia Poliphili_ (Venice, 1499) more than L120, rarer books\r\nare priced in hundreds. The best books on the subject are: for Italy,\r\nLippmann's _Wood Engraving in Italy in the 15th Century_ (1888),\r\nKristeller's _Early Florentine Woodcuts_ (1897), the duc de Rivoli's\r\n(Prince d'Essling's) _Bibliographie des livres a figures venitiens\r\n1469-1525_ (1892, new edition 1906); for Germany, Muther's _Die deutsche\r\nBucherillustration der Gothik und Fruhrenaissance_ (1884); for Holland\r\nand Belgium, Sir W.M. Conway's _The Woodcutters of the Netherlands in\r\nthe 15th Century_ (1884); for France the material will all be found in\r\nClaudin's _Histoire de l'imprimerie en France_ (1900, &c.). Some\r\ninformation on the illustrated books of the early 16th century is given\r\nin Butsch's _Die Bucherornamentik der Renaissance_ (1878), but the\r\npretty French books of the middle of the century and the later Dutch and\r\nEnglish copper-engraved book illustrations (for the latter see Colvin's\r\n_Early Engraving and Engravers in England_, 1905) have been imperfectly\r\nappreciated. This cannot be said of the French books of the 18th century\r\nchronicled by H. Cohen, _Guide de l'amateur de livre a gravures du\r\nXVIII^e siecle_ (5th ed., 1886), much of the same information, with a\r\nlittle more about English books, being given in Lewine's _Bibliography\r\nof Eighteenth Century Art and Illustrated Books_ (1898). English books\r\nwith coloured illustrations, for which there has arisen a sudden\r\nfashion, are well described in Martin Hardie's _English Colour Books_\r\n(1906). Bewick's work has been described by Mr Austin Dobson.\r\n\r\nAppreciation of finely printed books has seldom extended much beyond the\r\n15th century. In addition to the works mentioned in the article on\r\nincunabula(q.v.), note may be made of Humphrey's _Masterpieces of the\r\nEarly Printers and Engravers_ (1870), while Lippmann's _Druckschriften\r\ndes XV. bis XVIII Jahrhunderts_ (1884-1887) covers, though not very\r\nfully, the later period.\r\n\r\nAmong books which make an intellectual appeal to the collectors may be\r\nclassed all works of historical value which have not been reprinted, or\r\nof which the original editions are more authentic, or convincing, than\r\nmodern reprints. It is evident that these cover a vast field, and that\r\nthe collector in taking possession of any corner of it is at once the\r\nservant and rival of historical students. Lord Crawford's vast\r\ncollections of English, Scottish and Irish proclamations and of papal\r\nbulls may be cited as capital instances of the work which a collector\r\nmay do for the promotion of historical research, and the philological\r\nlibrary brought together by Prince Lucien Bonaparte (_An Attempt at a\r\nCatalogue_ by V. Collins, published 1894) and the Foxwell collection of\r\nearly books on political economy (presented to the university of London\r\nby the Goldsmiths' Company) are two other instances of recent date. Much\r\ncollecting of this kind is now being carried on by the libraries of\r\ninstitutes and societies connected with special professions and studies,\r\nbut there is ample room also for private collectors to work on these\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nOf books which appeal to a collector's imagination the most obvious\r\nexamples are those which can be associated with some famous person or\r\nevent. A book which has belonged to a king or queen (more especially one\r\nwho, like Mary queen of Scots, has appealed to popular sympathies), or\r\nto a great statesman, soldier or poet, which bears any mark of having\r\nbeen valued by him, or of being connected with any striking incident in\r\nhis life, has an interest which defies analysis. Collectors themselves\r\nhave a natural tenderness for their predecessors, and a copy of a famous\r\nwork is all the more regarded if its pedigree can be traced through a\r\nlong series of book-loving owners. Hence the production of such works as\r\n_Great Book-Collectors_ by Charles and Mary Elton (1893), _English\r\nBook-Collectors_ by W.Y. Fletcher (1902) and Guigard's _Nouvel armorial\r\ndu bibliophile_ (1890). Books condemned to be burnt, or which have\r\ncaused the persecution of their authors, have an imaginative interest of\r\nanother kind, though one which seems to have appealed more to writers of\r\nbooks than to collectors. As has already been noted, most of the books\r\nspecially valued by collectors make a double or triple appeal to the\r\ncollecting instinct, and the desire to possess first editions may be\r\naccounted for partly by their positive superiority over reprints for\r\npurposes of study, partly by the associations which they can be proved\r\nto possess or which imagination creates for them. The value set on them\r\nis at least to some extent fanciful. It would be difficult, for\r\ninstance, to justify the high prices paid by collectors of the days of\r\nGeorge III. for the first printed editions of the Greek and Latin\r\nclassics. With few exceptions these are of no value as texts, and there\r\nare no possible associations by which they can be linked with the\r\npersonality of their authors. It may be doubted whether any one now\r\ncollects them save as specimens of printing, though no class of books\r\nwhich has once been prized ever sinks back into absolute obscurity. On\r\nthe other hand the prestige of the first editions of English and French\r\nliterary masterpieces has immensely increased. A first folio Shakespeare\r\n(1623) was in 1906 sold separately for L3000, and the MacGeorge copies\r\nof the first four folios (1623, 1632, 1663-1664 and 1685) fetched\r\ncollectively the high price of L10,000. The quarto editions of\r\nShakespeare plays have appreciated even more, several of these little\r\nbooks, once sold at 6d. apiece, having fetched over L1000, while the\r\nunknown and unique copy of the 1594 edition of _Titus Andronicus_,\r\ndiscovered in Sweden, speedily passed to an American collector for\r\nL2000. Information as to early editions of famous English books will be\r\nfound in Lowndes' _Bibliographer's Manual_, in Hazlitt's _Handbook to\r\nthe Popular Poetical and Dramatic Literature of Great Britain from the\r\nInvention of Printing to the Restoration_ (1867) and his subsequent\r\n_Collections and Notes_ (1876-1903), and as to more recent books in\r\nSlater's _Early Editions, a bibliographical survey of the works of some\r\npopular modern authors_ (1894), while French classics have found an\r\nexcellent chronicler in Jules Le Petit (_Bibliographie des principales\r\neditions originales d'ecrivains francais du XV^e au XVIII^e siecle_,\r\n1888).\r\n\r\nIn most cases there is a marked falling off in the interest with which\r\nearly editions other than the first are regarded, and consequently in\r\nthe prices paid for them, though important changes in the text give to\r\nthe edition in which they first occur some shadow of the prestige\r\nattaching to an original issue. One of the recognized byways of\r\nbook-collecting, however, used to be the collection of as many editions\r\nas possible of the same work. When this result in the acquisition of\r\nnumerous late editions of no value for the text its only usefulness\r\nwould appear to be the index it may offer to the author's popularity.\r\nBut in translations of the Bible, in liturgical works, and in editions\r\npublished during the author's life the aid offered to the study of the\r\ndevelopment of the final text by a long row of intermediate editions may\r\nbe very great.\r\n\r\nAnother instance in which imagination reinforces the more positive\r\ninterest a book may possess is in the case of editions which can be\r\nconnected with the origin, diffusion or development of printing. Piety\r\nsuggests that book-lovers should take a special interest in the history\r\nof the art which has done so much for their happiness, and in this\r\nrespect they have mostly shown themselves religious. The first book\r\nprinted in any town is reasonably coveted by local antiquaries, and the\r\ndesire to measure the amount and quality of the work of every early\r\nprinter has caused the preservation of thousands of books which would\r\notherwise have perished. (See INCUNABULA.)\r\n\r\nThe financial side of book-collecting may be studied in Slater's\r\n_Book-Prices Current_, published annually since 1887, and in\r\nLivingston's _American Book Prices Current_, and in the same author's\r\n_Auction Prices of Books_ (1905). While largely influenced by fashion\r\nthe prices given for books are never wholly unreasonable. They are\r\ndetermined, firstly by the positive or associative interest which can be\r\nfound in the book itself, secondly by the infrequency with which copies\r\ncome into the market compared with the number and wealth of their\r\nwould-be possessors, and thirdly, except in the case of books of the\r\ngreatest interest and rarity, by the condition of the copy offered in\r\nrespect to completeness, size, freshness and absence of stains.\r\n     (A. W. Po.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK-KEEPING, a systematic record of business transactions, in a form\r\nconveniently available for reference, made by individuals or\r\ncorporations engaged in commercial or financial operations with a view\r\nto enabling them with the minimum amount of trouble and of dislocation\r\nto the business itself to ascertain at any time (1) the detailed\r\nparticulars of the transactions undertaken, and (2) the cumulative\r\neffect upon the business and its financial relations to others.\r\nBook-keeping, sometimes described as a science and sometimes as an art,\r\npartakes of the nature of both. It is not so much a discovery as a\r\ngrowth, the crude methods of former days having been gradually improved\r\nto meet the changing requirements of business, and this process of\r\nevolution is still going on. The ideal of any system of book-keeping is\r\nthe maximum of record combined with the minimum of labour, but as\r\ndishonesty has to be guarded against, no system of book-keeping can be\r\nregarded as adequate which does not enable the record to be readily\r\nverified as a true and complete statement of the transactions involved.\r\nSuch a verification is called an audit, and in the case of public and\r\nother large concerns is ordinarily undertaken by professional\r\naccountants (q.v.). Where the book-keeping staff is large it is\r\nusually organized so that its members, to some extent at least, check\r\neach other's work, and to that extent an audit, known as a \"staff audit\"\r\nor \"internal check,\" is frequently performed by the book-keeping staff\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nFormerly, when credit was a considerably less important factor than now\r\nin commercial transactions, book-keeping was frequently limited to an\r\naccount of receipts and payments of money; and in early times, before\r\nmoney was in use, to an account of the receipt and issue of goods of\r\ndifferent kinds. Even now what may be called the \"cash system\" of\r\naccounts is almost exclusively used by governments, local authorities,\r\nand charitable and other institutions; but in business it is equally\r\nnecessary to record movements of credit, as a mere statement of receipts\r\nand payments of money would show only a part of the total number of\r\ntransactions undertaken. As for practical purposes some limit must be\r\nplaced upon the daily record of transactions, certain classes show only\r\na record of cash receipts and payments, which must, when it is desired\r\nto ascertain the actual position of affairs, be adjusted by bringing\r\ninto account those transactions which have not yet been completed by the\r\nreceipt or payment of money. For instance, it is usual to charge\r\ncustomers with goods sold to them at the date when the sale takes place,\r\nand to give them credit for the amount received in payment upon the date\r\nof receipt (thus completely recording every phase of the transaction as\r\nand when it occurs); but in connexion (say) with wages it is not usual\r\nto give each workman credit for the services rendered by him from day to\r\nday, but merely to charge up the amounts, when paid, to a wages account,\r\nwhich thus at any date only shows the amounts which have actually been\r\npaid, and takes no cognisance of the sums accruing due. When, therefore,\r\nit is desired to ascertain the actual expenditure upon wages for any\r\ngiven period, it is necessary to allow for the payments made during that\r\nperiod in respect of work previously performed, and to add the value of\r\nwork performed during the current period which remains unpaid. In the\r\nmajority of businesses those accounts which deal with various forms of\r\nstanding expenses are thus dealt with, and in consequence the record, as\r\nit appears from day to day, is _pro tanto_ incomplete. Another very\r\nimportant series of transactions which is not included in the ordinary\r\nday-to-day record is that representing the loss gradually accruing by\r\nreason of waste, or depreciation, of assets or general equipment of the\r\nbusiness; proper allowance for these losses must of course be made\r\nwhenever it is desired to ascertain the true position of affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n  History.\r\n\r\nThe origin of book-keeping is lost in obscurity, but recent researches\r\nwould appear to show that some method of keeping accounts has existed\r\nfrom the remotest times. Babylonian records have been found dating back\r\nas far as 2600 B.C., written with a stylus on small slabs of clay, and\r\nit is of interest to note (_Records of the Past_, xi. 89) that these\r\nslabs or tablets \"usually contain impressions from cylinder seals, and\r\nnail marks, which were considered to be a man's natural seal,\" thus\r\nshowing that the modern method of identifying criminals by finger prints\r\nhad its counterpart in Babylonia some 4500 years ago. Egyptian records\r\nwere commonly written on papyrus, and contemporary pictures show a\r\nscribe keeping account of the quantities of grain brought into and\r\nremoved from the government store-houses. It will thus be seen that some\r\nform of book-keeping existed long before bound books were known, and\r\ntherefore the more general term _accounting_ would seem to be\r\npreferable--the more so as the most modern developments are in the\r\ndirection of again abandoning the bound book in favour of loose or\r\neasily detached sheets of paper or card, thus capable of being\r\nrearranged as circumstances or convenience may dictate. Most of the\r\nearlier accounting records are in the nature of a mere narrative of\r\nevents, which--however complete in itself--failed to fulfil the second\r\nrequirement of an adequate system of book-keeping already referred to.\r\nPrior to the use of money nothing in this direction could of course well\r\nbe attempted; but for a long time after its employment became general\r\nmoney values were recorded in Roman figures, which naturally did not\r\nlend themselves to ready calculation.\r\n\r\nAt the present-time it may be generally stated that all book-keeping\r\nrecords are kept in three distinct columns, dealing respectively with\r\nthe date of the transaction, its nature, and its money value. The\r\nearliest extant example of accounts so kept is probably a ledger in the\r\nAdvocates' library at Edinburgh, dated 1697, which, it is of interest to\r\nnote, is ruled by hand. Prior to that time, however, double-entry\r\nbook-keeping had been in general use. The exact date of its introduction\r\nis unknown; but it was certainly not, as has been frequently stated, the\r\ninvention of Lucas de Bergo, in or about 1494. This, however, is the\r\ndate of the first issue (at Venice) of a printed book entitled\r\n_Everything about Arithmetic, Geometry and Proportion_, by Luca Paciolo,\r\nwhich contains _inter alia_ an explanation of book-keeping by\r\ndouble-entry as then understood; but in all probability, the system had\r\nthen been in use for something like 200 years. It is perhaps unfortunate\r\nthat from 1494 until comparatively recent times the literature of\r\naccounting has been provided by theorists and students, rather than by\r\npractical business men, and it may well be doubted, therefore, whether\r\nit accurately describes contemporary procedure. Another illusion which\r\nit is necessary to expose in the interests of truth is the value\r\nattached to _Jones's English System of Book-keeping by Single or Double\r\nEntry_, published at Bristol in 1796. Before publishing this book, E.T.\r\nJones issued a prospectus, stating that he had patented an entirely new\r\nand greatly improved system, and that subscribers (at a guinea a copy)\r\nwould be entitled to a special licence empowering them to put the new\r\ninvention into practice in their own book-keeping. With this bait he\r\nsecured thousands of subscribers, but so far as can be gathered his\r\nsystem was entirely without merit, and it is chiefly of interest as\r\nindicating the value, even then, of advertising.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Modern methods.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible here to describe fully all the improvements that have\r\nbeen made in methods of accounting during recent years, but it is\r\nproposed to deal with the more important of these improvements, after\r\nthe general principles upon which all systems of book-keeping are based\r\nhave been briefly described.\r\n\r\nThe centre of all book-keeping systems is the _ledger_, and it may be\r\nsaid that all other books are only kept as a matter of practical\r\nconvenience--hence the name \"subsidiary books\" that is frequently\r\napplied thereto. Inasmuch, however, as the transactions are first\r\nrecorded in these subsidiary books, and afterwards classified therefrom\r\ninto the ledger, the names _books of entry_ or _books of first entry_\r\nare often employed. Subsidiary books which do not form the basis of\r\nsubsequent entries into the ledger, but are merely used for statistical\r\npurposes, are known as _statistical_ or _auxiliary books_. In the early\r\ndays of book-keeping the ledger comprised merely those accounts which it\r\nwas thought desirable to keep accessible, and was not a complete record\r\nof all transactions. Thus in many instances records were only kept of\r\ntransactions with other business houses, known as _personal accounts_.\r\nIn the earliest examples transactions tending to reduce indebtedness\r\nwere recorded in order of date, as they occurred underneath transactions\r\nrecording the creation of the indebtedness; and the amount of the\r\nreduction was subtracted from the sum of the indebtedness up to that\r\ndate. This method was found to be inconvenient, and the next step was to\r\nkeep one account of the transactions recording the creation of\r\nindebtedness and another account (called the _contra account_) of those\r\ntransactions reducing or extinguishing it. For convenience these two\r\naccounts were kept on opposite sides of the ledger, and thus was evolved\r\nthe _Dr._ and _Cr._ account as at present in general use:--\r\n\r\n   _Dr._    A.B.                              Contra.    _Cr._\r\n  -------+-------------+---------++-------+------------+---------\r\n   Date. |  Narrative. | Amount. || Date. | Narrative. | Amount.\r\n  -------+-------------+---------++-------+------------+---------\r\n         |             | L s. d. ||       |            | L s. d.\r\n         |             |         ||       |            |\r\n         |             |         ||       |            |\r\n         |             |         ||       |            |\r\n\r\nIn this form of account all transactions creating indebtedness due from\r\nthe person named therein to the business--that is to say, all benefits\r\nreceived by that person from the buisness--are recorded upon the\r\nleft-hand, or _Dr._ side, and _per contra_ all transactions representing\r\nbenefits imparted by him, giving rise to a liability on the part of the\r\nbusiness, are recorded upon the _Cr._ side. The account may run on\r\nindefinitely, but as a matter of convenience is usually ruled off each\r\ntime all indebtedness is extinguished, and also at certain periodical\r\nintervals, so that the state of the account may then be readily\r\napparent.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Single-entry accounts.\r\n\r\nA mere collection of _personal accounts_ is, however, obviously a very\r\nincomplete record of the transactions of any business, and does not\r\nsuffice to enable a statement of its financial position to be prepared.\r\nSo at an early date other accounts were added to the ledger, recording\r\nthe acquisition of and disposal of different classes of property, such\r\naccounts being generally known as _real accounts_. These accounts are\r\nkept upon the same principle as personal accounts, in that all\r\nexpenditure upon the part of the business is recorded upon the _Dr._\r\nside, and all receipts upon the _Cr._ side; the excess of the debit\r\nentries over the credit entries thus showing the value placed upon those\r\nassets that still remain the property of the business. With the aid of\r\npersonal and real accounts properly written up to date, it is possible\r\nat any time to prepare a statement of assets and liabilities showing the\r\nfinancial position of a business, and the following is an example of\r\nsuch a statement, which shows also how the profit made by the business\r\nmay be thus ascertained, assuming that the financial position at the\r\ncommencement of the current financial period, and the movements of\r\ncapital into and out of the business during the period, are capable of\r\nbeing ascertained.\r\n\r\n  STATE OF AFFAIRS AS AT 31ST DECEMBER 1906\r\n\r\n  +----+--------------------+----------------++------------------+---------------\r\n  |    |   _Liabilities._   |                ||    _Assets._     |\r\n  |    |                    |                ||                  |\r\n  |    | Trade Creditors    |  L4,961  10  0 || Fixtures, Furni- |\r\n  |    | Bills Payable      |   2,620  18  4 ||   ture, &c.      | L1,269   4   3\r\n  |    | Balance, being ex- |                || Stock on hand    |  5,751   3  10\r\n  |    |   cess of assets   |                || Trade Debtors    |  3,842   7   9\r\n  |    |   over liabilities |                || Bills Recievable |  7,468  14   3\r\n  |    |   (or \"Capital\")   |                || Cash at Bank     |  4,169   5   5\r\n  |    |   at this date     |                ||                  |\r\n  |    |   carried down     | 14,918    7  4 ||                  |\r\n  |    |                    +----------------++                  +---------------\r\n  |    |                    |L22,500   15  6 ||                  |L22,500  15   6\r\n  |    |                    +----------------++                  +---------------\r\n  |    | Amount of Capi-    |                || Balance brought  |\r\n  |    |   tal on 1st Jan.  |                ||   down           |L14,918   7   2\r\n  |    |   1906             |L15,010    1  7 ||                  |\r\n  |    | Balance, being net |                || Amount drawn     |\r\n  |    |   profit for the   |                ||   out of business|\r\n  |    |   year ended this  |                ||   during year    |\r\n  |    |   date             |  1,408    5  7 ||   ended this date|  1,500   0   0\r\n  |    |                    +----------------++                  +---------------\r\n  |    |                    |L16,418    7  2 ||                  |L16,418    7  2\r\n  +----+--------------------+----------------++------------------+---------------\r\n\r\nThe method of accounting hitherto described represents _single-entry_,\r\nwhich--albeit manifestly incomplete--is still very generally used by\r\nsmall business houses, and particularly by retail traders. Its essential\r\nweakness is that it provides no automatic check upon the clerical\r\naccuracy of the record, and, should any mistake be made in the keeping\r\nof the books, or in the extraction therefrom of the lists of assets and\r\nliabilities, the statement of assets and liabilities and the profit or\r\nloss of the current financial period, will be incorrect to an equal\r\nextent. It was to avoid this obvious weakness of single-entry that the\r\nsystem of double-entry was evolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Double-entry.\r\n\r\nThe essential principle of double-entry is that it constitutes a\r\ncomplete record of _every_ business transaction, and as these\r\ntransactions are invariably cross-dealings--involving simultaneously the\r\nreceipt of a benefit by some one and the imparting of a benefit by some\r\none--a complete record of transactions from both points of view\r\nnecessitates an entry of equal amount upon debit and credit sides of the\r\nledger. Hence it follows that, if the clerical work be correctly\r\nperformed, the aggregate amount entered up upon the debit side of the\r\nledger must at all times equal the aggregate amount entered up upon the\r\ncredit side; and thus a complete list of all ledger balances will show\r\nan agreement of the total debit balances with the total credit balances.\r\nSuch a list is called a _trial balance_, an example of which is given\r\nbelow. It should be observed, however, that the test supplied by the\r\n_trial balance_ is a purely mechanical one, and does not prove the\r\nabsolute accuracy of the ledger as a record of transactions. Thus\r\ntransactions which have actually taken place may have been omitted from\r\nthe books altogether, or they may have been recorded to the wrong\r\naccounts, or the money values attached to them may be incorrect; or, yet\r\nagain, fictitious records may be entered in the ledger of transactions\r\nwhich have never taken place. A _trial balance_ is thus no very adequate\r\nsafeguard against fraud, nor does it bring to light mistakes in the\r\nmonetary value attaching to the various transactions recorded. This last\r\npoint is of especial importance, in that the monetary value of\r\ntransactions may have been correctly recorded in the first instance, but\r\nowing to altered circumstances may have become inaccurate at a later\r\ndate. This of course means that the altered circumstances constitute an\r\nadditional \"transaction\" which has been omitted.\r\n\r\n  TRIAL BALANCE, 31ST DECEMBER 1906\r\n\r\n  ----+-------------------------+---------------+--------------\r\n      |                         | _Dr._         | _Cr._\r\n    1 | Capital account         |               | L15,010  1  7\r\n    5 | Drawings                |   1,500  0  0 |\r\n   20 | Trade creditors         |               |   4,961 10  0\r\n   24 | Fixtures, furniture, &c.|   1,269  4  3 |\r\n   27 | Bills payable           |               |   2,620 18  4\r\n   40 | Bad debts               |      71  4  2 |\r\n   44 | Stock 1st Jan. 1906     |   4,078 16  4 |\r\n   50 | Discounts allowed       |     975  3  3 |\r\n   53 | Trade debtors           |   3,842  7  9 |\r\n   60 | Discounts received      |               |   1,117 17  8\r\n   65 | Wages and salaries      |   1,865 12  0 |\r\n   75 | Depreciation            |     141  0  5 |\r\n   78 | Rent, rates and taxes   |   1,242 13  8 |\r\n   82 | General expenses        |   1,087  8  0 |\r\n   90 | Bills receivable        |   7,468 14  3 |\r\n   97 | Purchases               |  44,731  2 10 |\r\n  100 | Sales                   |               |  48,732  4  9\r\n  C56 | Cash at bank            |   4,169  5  5 |\r\n      |                         +---------------+--------------\r\n      |                         | L72,442 12  4 | L72,442 12  4\r\n  ----+-------------------------+---------------+--------------\r\n\r\n\r\n  Balance sheet.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed, therefore, that in order to complete the record of\r\nthe transactions by double-entry, it has become necessary to introduce\r\ninto the ledger a third class of accounts, known as _impersonal_ or\r\n_nominal accounts_. These accounts record the transferences of money, or\r\nof money's worth, which, so far from representing a mere reshuffling of\r\nassets and liabilities, involve an increase in or a reduction of the\r\namount invested in the business, i.e. a profit or a loss. Transactions\r\nrepresenting profits are recorded upon the _Cr._ side of nominal\r\naccounts, and those representing losses (including expenses) upon the\r\n_Dr._ side. This is consistent with the rules already laid down in\r\nconnexion with real and nominal accounts, inasmuch as expenditure which\r\ndoes not result in the acquisition of an asset is a loss, whereas\r\nreceipts which do not involve the creation of liabilities represent\r\nprofits. All debit balances therefore that are not assets are losses,\r\nand _per contra_ all credit balances that are not liabilities are\r\nprofits. So that, inasmuch as double-entry provides _inter alia_ a\r\ncomplete statement under suitable headings of all profits and all\r\nlosses, it is possible by aggregating these results to deduce therefrom\r\nthe net profit or loss of carrying on the business--and that by a method\r\nentirely distinct from that previously described in connexion with\r\nsingle-entry, thus constituting a valuable additional check. Taking the\r\ntrial balance shown above, the following represent the _trading\r\naccount_, _profit and loss account_, and _balance sheet_ compiled\r\ntherefrom. The trading account may be variously regarded as the account\r\nrecording the movements of goods which represent the stock-in-trade, and\r\nas a preliminary to (or a subdivision of) the profit and loss account.\r\nThe balance sheet is a statement of the assets and liabilities;\r\nbut--inasmuch as, by transferring the balance of the profit and loss\r\naccount to the capital account, it is possible to bring the latter\r\naccount up to date and to show the credit balance representing the\r\nsurplus of assets over liabilities to date--the balance sheet, instead\r\nof showing a difference, or a \"balance,\" representing what is _assumed\r\nto be_ the amount of the capital to date, shows an absolute agreement of\r\nassets upon the one hand and of liabilities _plus_ capital upon the\r\nother. The two sides of the account thus balance--hence the name.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Dr._                   TRADING ACCOUNT for the Year ended 31st December 1906                         _Cr._\r\n

foregoing example the customary method has been followed of\r\ndeducting withdrawals of capital from the capital account and of adding\r\nprofits thereto. Sometimes, however, the balance of the capital account\r\nremains constant, and the drawings and net profits are transferred to a\r\nseparate account called _current account_. This plan is but rarely\r\nobserved in the case of undertakings owned by individuals, or private\r\nfirms, but is invariably adopted in connexion with joint-stock\r\ncompanies, although in such cases the name _appropriation of profit\r\naccount_ is generally employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Journal.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is now usual to employ several books of first-entry, in the\r\ncase of comparatively small businesses one such book is sufficient for\r\nall purposes, in that it is practicable for one person to record all the\r\ntransactions that take place as and when they occur. A book of this\r\ndescription is called the _journal_, and for many years represented the\r\nonly book of first-entry employed in book-keeping. An example of the\r\njournal is given below. The entries appearing therein are such as would\r\nbe necessary to prepare the trading and profit and loss accounts from\r\nthe trial balance shown above, and to bring the capital account up to\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nIn modern times, however, with the growth of business, it was soon found\r\nimpracticable to keep one book of first-entry for all transactions, and\r\naccordingly it became necessary either to treat the journal as an\r\nintermediate book, in which the transactions might be brought together\r\nand focused as a preliminary to being recorded in the ledger, or else to\r\nsplit up the journal into numerous books of first-entry, each of which\r\nmight in that case be employed for the record of a particular class of\r\ntransaction. The first method has been generally adopted in the\r\ncontinental countries of Europe, as will be shown later on, whereas in\r\nGreat Britain and in North America the latter method more generally\r\nobtains; that is, instead of having one journal in which all classes of\r\ntransactions are recorded in the first instance, it is usual to employ\r\nseveral journals, as follows:--a _sales journal, sales book_ or _day\r\nbook_, to record particulars of goods sold; a _bought journal, invoice\r\nbook_ or _purchases book_, to record particulars of goods purchased; a\r\n_returns inwards book_, to record particulars of goods sold but\r\nsubsequently returned by customers; a _returns outwards book_, to record\r\nthe like particulars with regard to goods purchased and subsequently\r\nreturned; a _bills receivable book_, to record particulars of bills of\r\nexchange received from debtors; and a _bills payable book_, to record\r\nparticulars of bills of exchange given to creditors.\r\n\r\n\r\n  JOURNAL 1906\r\n\r\n  -------+----------------------------+----+---------------+---------------+\r\n         |                            |    |  _Dr._        | _Cr._         |\r\n  Dec. 31|Trading account             |110 | L48,809 19  2 |               |\r\n         |  To Stock account          | 44 |               | L 4,078 16  4 |\r\n         |  \" Purchases account       | 97 |               |  44,731  2 10 |\r\n         +----------------------------+    |               |               |\r\n     \"   |Sales account               |100 |  48,732  4  9 |               |\r\n         |Stock account               | 44 |   5,751  3 10 |               |\r\n         |  To Trading account        |110 |               |  54,483  8  7 |\r\n         +----------------------------+    |               |               |\r\n     \"   |Trading account             |110 |   5,673  9  5 |               |\r\n         |  To Profit and Loss        |    |               |               |\r\n         |      account               |120 |               |   5,673  9  5 |\r\n         +----------------------------+    |               |               |\r\n     \"   |Profit and Loss account     |120 |   5,383  1  6 |               |\r\n         |  To Rent, rates and taxes  | 78 |               |   1,242 13  8 |\r\n         |  \"  Salaries and wages     | 65 |               |   1,865 12  0 |\r\n         |  \"  General expenses       | 82 |               |   1,087  8  0 |\r\n         |  \"  Discounts allowed      | 50 |               |     975  3  3 |\r\n         |  \"  Bad debts              | 40 |               |      71  4  2 |\r\n         |  \"  Depreciation           | 75 |               |     141  0  5 |\r\n         +----------------------------+    |               |               |\r\n     \"   |Discounts received          | 60 |   1,117 17  8 |               |\r\n         |  To Profit and Loss account|120 |               |   1,117 17  8 |\r\n         +----------------------------+    |               |               |\r\n     \"   |Profit and Loss account     |120 |   1,408  5  7 |               |\r\n         |  To A.B., Capital account  |  1 |               |   1,408  5  7 |\r\n         +----------------------------+    |               |               |\r\n         |A.B., Captial account       |  1 |   1,500  0  0 |               |\r\n         |  To Drawings account       |  5 |               |   1,500  0  0 |\r\n         |                            |    +---------------+---------------+\r\n         |                            |    |L118,376  1 11 |L118,376  1 11 |\r\n  ------------------------------------+----+---------------+---------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n  DAY BOOK 1906\r\n\r\n  -----+----------------------------------+---------+-----------\r\n       |             Forward              |         |L3761  7  8\r\n       +--------- 27th December. ---------+         |\r\n       | A.

Thus the cash account and the bank account are\r\nfrequently bound together in one separate book called the _cash book_,\r\nshowing in parallel columns the movements of office cash and of cash at\r\nthe bank, and by the addition of a third column for discounts the\r\nnecessity of keeping an additional book of first entry as a _discount\r\njournal_ may also be avoided. Of late years, however, most businesses\r\npay all moneys received into their bankers without deduction, and pay\r\nall accounts by cheque; the necessity of an account for office cash thus\r\nno longer exists, save in connexion with petty payments, which are\r\nrecorded in a separate book called the _petty cash book_. With regard to\r\nthe remaining ledger accounts, personal accounts--which are the most\r\nnumerous--are frequently separated from the real and nominal accounts,\r\nand are further subdivided so that customers' accounts are kept separate\r\nfrom the accounts of trade creditors. The customers' accounts are kept\r\nin a ledger (or, if need be, in several ledgers) called _sales ledgers_,\r\nor _sold ledgers_; while the accounts of trade creditors are similarly\r\nkept in _purchases ledgers_ or _bought ledgers_. The nominal and real\r\naccounts, if together, are kept in what is called the _general ledger_;\r\nbut this may be further subdivided into a _nominal ledger_ and a\r\n_private ledger_. This last subdivision is, however, rarely made upon a\r\nscientific basis, for such accounts as the profit and loss account and\r\ntrading account are generally kept in the private ledger although\r\nstrictly speaking nominal accounts; while the bills receivable account\r\nand the bills payable account are generally kept in the nominal ledger,\r\nso as to reduce to a minimum the amount of clerical work in connexion\r\nwith the private ledger, which is kept either by the principal himself\r\nor by his confidential employee. By the employment of _adjustment\r\naccounts_, which complete the double-entry record in each ledger, these\r\nvarious ledgers may readily be made self-balancing, thus enabling\r\nclerical errors to be localized and responsibility enforced.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Tabular book-keeping.\r\n\r\nOf recent years considerable attention has been devoted to further\r\nmodifications of book-keeping methods with a view to reducing clerical\r\nwork, increasing the speed with which results are available, and\r\nenabling them to be handled more quickly and with greater certainty.\r\n_Tabular book-keeping_ is a device to achieve one or more of these ends\r\nby the substitution of books ruled with numerous columns for the more\r\nusual form. The system may be applied either to books of first entry or\r\nto ledgers. As applied to books of first-entry it enables the same book\r\nto deal conveniently with more than one class of transaction; thus if\r\nthe trading of a business is divided into several departments, by\r\nproviding a separate column for the sales of each department it is\r\npossible readily to arrive at separate totals for the aggregate sales of\r\neach, thus simplifying the preparation of departmental trading accounts.\r\nAs applied to ledgers, the application of the system may be best\r\ndescribed by the aid of the above example (the proceedings of the\r\ncolumns being given only), which shows how a very large number of\r\npersonal accounts may be recorded upon a single opening of a ledger\r\nprovided the number of entries to be made against each individual be\r\nfew.\r\n\r\n  -------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n    (a)  |  (b)  |  (c)  |  (d)  |  (e)  |  (f)  |  (g)  |  (h)  |  (i)  |  (j)  |  (k)  |  (l)\r\n  -------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n         |       |L s. d.|L s. d.|L s. d.|       |L s. d.|L s. d.|L s. d.|L s. d.|L s. d.|\r\n         |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n         |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n         |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n\r\n    (a) Reference No.                  (b) Name of Debtor.\r\n    (c) Amount due on 1st Oct. 1906    (d) Charges for Current Quarter.\r\n    (e) Total Debit.

This\r\nsystem may be applied to books of first-entry, or to ledgers, or to\r\nboth. As applied to books of first-entry it aims at so modifying the\r\noriginal record of the transaction--whether it represents an invoice for\r\ngoods sold or an acknowledgment given for money received--that a\r\nfacsimile duplicate may be taken of the original entry by the aid of a\r\ncarbon sheet, which instead of being immovably bound up in a book is\r\ncapable of being handled separately and placed in any desired order or\r\nposition, and thus more readily recorded in the ledger. Postings are\r\nthus made direct from the original slips, which have been first sorted\r\nout into an order convenient for that purpose, and afterwards resorted\r\nso that the total sales of each department may be readily computed;\r\nafter which they are filed away in a form convenient for reference.\r\nSometimes the process is carried a step further, and the original slips,\r\nfiled away with suitable guide-cards indicating the nature of the\r\naccount, themselves constitute the ledger record--which in such cases is\r\nto be found scattered over a number of sheets, one for each transaction,\r\ninstead of, as in the case of the ordinary book ledger, a considerable\r\nnumber of transactions being recorded upon a single page. This\r\nadaptation of the slip system is impracticable except in cases where the\r\ntransactions with each individual are few in number, and is not worth\r\nadoption unless the exceedingly large number of personal accounts makes\r\nit important as far as possible to avoid all duplication of clerical\r\nwork. The more usual adaptation of the slip system to ledgers is to be\r\nfound in the employment of _card ledgers_ or _loose-leaf ledgers_. With\r\ncard ledgers (fig. 1) each ledger account is upon an independent sheet\r\nof cardboard suitably arranged in drawers or cabinets. The system is\r\nadvantageous as allowing all dead matter to be eliminated from the\r\nrecord continuously in use, and as permitting the order in which the\r\naccounts stand to be varied from time to time as convenience dictates,\r\nthus (if necessary) enabling the accounts to be always kept in\r\nalphabetical order in spite of the addition of new accounts and the\r\ndropping out of old ones. An especial convenience of the card system is\r\nthat in times of pressure any desired number of book-keepers may be\r\nsimultaneously employed, whereas the maximum number that can be usefully\r\nemployed upon any bound book is two. The loose-leaf ledger (fig. 2) may\r\nbe described as midway between card and bound ledgers. It consists of a\r\nnumber of sheets in book form, so bound as to be capable of being\r\nreadily separated when desired. The loose-leaf ledger thus embraces most\r\nof the advantages of the card ledger, while remaining sufficiently like\r\nthe more old-fashioned book ledger as to enable it to be readily handled\r\nby those whose previous experience has been confined to the latter. Both\r\nthe card and loose-leaf systems will be frequently found of value for\r\nrecords in connexion with cost and stores accounts, quite irrespective\r\nof their advantages in connexion with the book-keeping records pure and\r\nsimple of certain businesses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Loose-Leaf Ledger (Library Bureau System.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Legislative Requirements.\r\n\r\nAll book-keeping methods rest upon the same fundamental principles, but\r\ntheir development in practice in different countries is to some extent\r\ninfluenced by the manner in which business is there conducted, and by\r\nthe legislative requirements imposed by the several states. In France\r\ntraders are required by the Code of Commerce to keep three books--a\r\njournal, an inventory and a letter book, somewhat elaborate provisions\r\nbeing made to identify these books, and to prevent substitution. The\r\ncompulsory journal makes the employment of numerous books of first-entry\r\nimpossible without an undesirable amount of duplication, and wherever\r\nthis provision obtains the book-keeping methods are in an accordingly\r\ncomparatively backward state. The inventory book comprises periodical\r\nlists of ledger balances and the balance sheet, records which are\r\ninvariably kept under every adequate system, although not always in a\r\nbook specially set aside for that purpose. In Germany the statutory\r\nrequirements are similar to those in France, save that the journal is\r\nnot compulsory; but there is an additional provision that the accounts\r\nare to be kept in _bound_ books with the pages numbered consecutively--a\r\nrequirement which makes the introduction of card or loose-leaf ledgers\r\nof doubtful legality. A balance sheet must be drawn up every year; but\r\nwhere a stock-in-trade is from its nature or its size difficult to take,\r\nit is sufficient for an inventory to be taken every two years. In\r\nBelgium the law requires every merchant to keep a journal recording his\r\ntransactions from day to day, which (with the balance book) must be\r\ninitialled by a prescribed officer. All letters and telegrams received,\r\nand copies of all such sent, must be preserved for ten years. The\r\nCommercial Code of Spain requires an inventory, journal, ledger, letter\r\nbook and invoice book to be kept; while that of Portugal prescribes the\r\nuse of a balance book, journal, ledger and copy-letter book. The law of\r\nHolland requires business men to keep books in which are correctly\r\nrecorded their commercial transactions, letters received and copies of\r\nletters sent. It also provides for the preparation of an annual balance\r\nsheet. The law of Rumania makes the employment of journal, inventory\r\nbook and ledger compulsory, a small tax per page being charged on the\r\ntwo first named. There are no special provisions as to book-keeping\r\ncontained in the Russian law, nor in the United States law, but in\r\nRussia public companies have to supply the government with copies of\r\ntheir annual accounts, which are published in a state newspaper, and in\r\nthe United States certain classes of companies have to submit their\r\naccounts to an official audit. In general terms it may be stated that at\r\nthe present time the employment of card and loose-leaf ledger systems is\r\nmore general in the United States than in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Education.\r\n\r\nApart from the organizations of professional accountants, there is none\r\nof note devoted to the scientific study of book-keeping other than\r\npurely educational institutions. Among the universities those in the\r\nUnited States were the first to include accounting as part of their\r\ncurriculum; while in Great Britain the London School of Economics\r\n(university of London), the university of Birmingham, and the Victoria\r\nUniversity of Manchester have, so far, alone treated the subject\r\nseriously and upon adequate lines. Quite recently Japan has been making\r\na movement in the same direction, and other countries will doubtless\r\nfollow suit. In England there have for a number of years past been\r\nvarious bodies--such for instance as the Society of Arts, the London\r\nChamber of Commerce and Owens College, Manchester--which hold\r\nexaminations in book-keeping and grant diplomas to successful\r\ncandidates, while most of the polytechnics and technical schools give\r\ninstruction in book-keeping; these latter, however, for the most part\r\nregard it as a \"craft\" merely.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Those interested in the bibliography of book-keeping are\r\n  referred to the catalogue of the library of the Institute of Chartered\r\n  Accountants in England and Wales, which probably contains the most\r\n  complete collection in existence of ancient and modern works on\r\n  accounting, both British and foreign. The following short list\r\n  comprises those most likely to be found of general interest: G. van de\r\n  Linde, _Book-keeping_ (1898); L.R. Dicksee, _Book-keeping_ (5th ed.,\r\n  1906) and _Advanced Accounting_ (2nd ed., 1905); _Encyclopaedia of\r\n  Accounting_, ed. by G. Lisle (1903); _Accountants' Library_, ed. by\r\n  the editor of _The Accountant_ (1901); J.W. Heaps, _The Antiquity of\r\n  Book-keeping_ (1898); _History of Accounting and Accountants_, ed. by\r\n  R. Brown (1905).     (L. R. D.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK-PLATES. The book-plate, or _ex-libris_, a printed label intended to\r\nindicate ownership in individual volumes, is nearly as old as the\r\nprinted book itself. It bears very much the same relation to the\r\nhand-painted armorial or otherwise symbolical personal device found in\r\nmedieval manuscripts that the printed page does to the scribe's work.\r\nThe earliest known examples of book-plates are German. According to\r\nFriedrich Warnecke, of Berlin (one of the best authorities on the\r\nsubject), the oldest movable _ex-libris_ are certain woodcuts\r\nrepresenting a shield of arms supported by an angel (fig. 1), which were\r\npasted in books presented to the Carthusian monastery of Buxheim by\r\nBrother Hildebrand Brandenburg of Biberach, about the year 1480--the\r\ndate being fixed by that of the recorded gift. The woodcut, in imitation\r\nof similar devices in old MSS., is hand-painted. In France the most\r\nancient _ex-libris_ as yet discovered is that of one Jean Bertaud de la\r\nTour-Blanche, the date of which is 1529; and in England that of Sir\r\nNicholas Bacon, a gift-plate for the books he presented to the\r\nuniversity of Cambridge (fig. 2). Holland comes next with the plate of\r\na certain Anna van der Aa, in 1597; then Italy with one attributed to\r\nthe year 1622. The earliest known American example is the plain printed\r\nlabel of one John Williams, 1679.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Gift-plate of Hildebrand Brandenburg of Biberach\r\nto the Monastery of Buxheim (c. 1480).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Book-plate of Sir Nicholas Bacon (slightly\r\nreduced).]\r\n\r\nA sketch of the history of the book-plate, either as a minor work of\r\nsymbolical and decorative art, or as an accessory to the binding of\r\nbooks, must obviously begin in Germany, not only because the earliest\r\nexamples known are German, but also because they are found in great\r\nnumbers long before the fashion spread to other countries, and are often\r\nof the highest artistic interest. Albrecht Durer is known to have\r\nactually engraved at least six plates (some of very important size)\r\nbetween 1503 and 1516 (fig. 3), and to have supplied designs for many\r\nothers. Several notable plates are ascribed to Lucas Cranach and to Hans\r\nHolbein, and to that bevy of so-called Little Masters, the Behams,\r\nVirgil Solis, Matthias Zundt, Jost Amman, Saldorfer, Georg Hupschmann\r\nand others. The influence of these draughtsmen over the decorative\r\nstyles of Germany has been felt through subsequent centuries down to the\r\npresent day, notwithstanding the invasion of successive Italian and\r\nFrench fashions during the 17th and 18th centuries, and the marked\r\neffort at originality of composition observable among modern designers.\r\nThe heavy, over-elaborated German style never seems to have affected\r\nneighbouring countries; but since it was undoubtedly from Germany that\r\nwas spread the fashion of ornamental book-plates as marks of possession,\r\nthe history of German _ex-libris_ remains on that account one of high\r\ninterest to all those who are curious in the matter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Book-plate of Lazarus Spengler, by Albrecht\r\nDurer, 1515 (reduced).]\r\n\r\nIt was not before the 17th century that the _movable ex-libris_ became\r\ntolerably common in France. Up to that time the more luxurious habit of\r\nstamping the cover with a personal device had been in such general\r\nfavour with book-owners as to render the use of labels superfluous. From\r\nthe middle of the century, however, the _ex-libris_ proper became quite\r\nnaturalized; examples of that period are very numerous, and, as a rule,\r\nare very handsome. It may be here pointed out that the expression\r\n_ex-libris_, used as a substantive, which is now the recognized term for\r\nbook-plate everywhere on the continent, found its origin in France. The\r\nwords only occur in the personal tokens of other nationalities long\r\nafter they had become a recognized inscription on French labels.\r\n\r\nIn many ways the consideration of the English book-plate, in its\r\nnumerous styles, from the late Elizabethan to the late Victorian period,\r\nis peculiarly interesting. In all its varieties it reflects with great\r\nfidelity the prevailing taste in decorative art at different epochs. Of\r\nEnglish examples, none thus far seems to have been discovered of older\r\ndate than the gift-plate of Sir Nicholas Bacon; for the celebrated,\r\ngorgeous, hand-painted armorial device attached to a folio that once\r\nbelonged to Henry VIII., and now reposes in the King's library, British\r\nMuseum, does not come under the head of book-plate in its modern sense.\r\nThe next is that of Sir Thomas Tresham, dated 1585. Until the last\r\nquarter of the 17th century the number of authentic English plates is\r\nvery limited. Their composition is always remarkably simple, and\r\ndisplays nothing of the German elaborateness. They are as a rule very\r\nplainly armorial, and the decoration is usually limited to a symmetrical\r\narrangement of mantling, with an occasional display of palms or wreaths.\r\nSoon after the Restoration, however, a book-plate seems to have suddenly\r\nbecome an established accessory to most well-ordered libraries.\r\nBook-plates of that period offer very distinctive characteristics. In\r\nthe simplicity of their heraldic arrangements they recall those of the\r\nprevious age; but their physiognomy is totally different. In the first\r\nplace, they invariably display the tincture lines and dots, after the\r\nmethod originally devised in the middle of the century by Petra Sancta,\r\nthe author of _Tesserae Gentilitiae_, which by this time had become\r\nadopted throughout Europe. In the second, the mantling assumes a much\r\nmore elaborate appearance--one that irresistibly recalls that of the\r\nperiwig of the period--surrounding the face of the shield. This style\r\nwas undoubtedly imported from France, but it assumed a character of its\r\nown in England. As a matter of fact, thenceforth until the dawn of the\r\nFrench Revolution, English modes of decoration in book-plates, as in\r\nmost other chattels, follow at some years' distance the ruling French\r\ntaste. The main characteristics of the style which prevailed during the\r\nQueen Anne and early Georgian periods are:--ornamental frames suggestive\r\nof carved oak, a frequent use of fish-scales, trellis or diapered\r\npatterns, for the decoration of plain surfaces; and, in the armorial\r\ndisplay, a marked reduction in the importance of the mantling. The\r\nintroduction of the scallop-shell as an almost constant element of\r\nornamentation gives already a foretaste of the _Rocaille-Coquille_, the\r\nso-called Chippendale fashions of the next reign. As a matter of fact,\r\nduring the middle third of the century this rococo style (of which the\r\nConvers plate [fig. 4] gives a tolerably typical sample) affects the\r\nbook-plate as universally as all other decorative objects. Its chief\r\nelement is a fanciful arrangement of scroll and shell work with\r\ncurveting acanthus-like sprays--an arrangement which in the examples of\r\nthe best period is generally made asymmetrical in order to give freer\r\nscope for a variety of countercurves. Straight or concentric lines and\r\nall appearances of flat surface are studiously avoided; the helmet and\r\nits symmetrical mantling tends to disappear, and is replaced by the\r\nplain crest on a fillet. The earlier examples of this manner are\r\ntolerably ponderous and simple. Later, however, the composition becomes\r\nexceedingly light and complicated; every conceivable and often\r\nincongruous element of decoration is introduced, from cupids to dragons,\r\nfrom flowerets to Chinese pagodas. During the early part of George\r\nIII.'s reign there is a return to greater sobriety of ornamentation, and\r\na style more truly national, which may be called _the urn style_, makes\r\nits appearance. Book-plates of this period have invariably a physiognomy\r\nwhich at once recalls the decorative manner made popular by architects\r\nand designers such as Chambers, the Adams, Josiah Wedgwood, Hepplewhite\r\nand Sheraton. The shield shows a plain spade-like outline, manifestly\r\nbased upon that of the pseudo-classic urn then so much to the fore. The\r\nornamental accessories are symmetrical palms and sprays, wreaths and\r\nribands. The architectural boss is also an important factor. In many\r\nplates, indeed, the shield of arms takes quite a subsidiary position by\r\nthe side of the predominantly architectural urn. From the beginning of\r\nthe 19th century, until comparatively recent days, no special style of\r\ndecoration seems to have established itself. The immense majority of\r\nexamples display a plain shield of arms with motto on a scroll below,\r\nand crest on a fillet above. Of late years, however, a rapid impetus\r\nappears to have been given to the designing of _ex-libris_; a new era,\r\nin fact, has begun for the book-plate, one of great interest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Book-plate of P.A. Convers, 1762.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Book-plate of Francis Gwyn of Lansanor, 1698.]\r\n\r\nThe main styles of decoration (and these, other data being absent, must\r\nalways in the case of old examples remain the criteria of date) have\r\nalready been noticed. It is, however, necessary to point out that\r\ncertain styles of composition were also prevalent at certain periods.\r\nMany of the older plates (like the majority of the most modern ones)\r\nwere essentially pictorial. Of this kind the best-defined English genus\r\nmay be recalled: _the library interior_--a term which explains\r\nitself--and _book-piles_, exemplified by the _ex-libris_ (fig. 6) of W.\r\nHewer, Samuel Pepys's secretary. We have also many _portrait-plates_, of\r\nwhich, perhaps, the most notable are those of Samuel Pepys himself and\r\nof John Gibbs, the architect; _allegories_, such as were engraved by\r\nHogarth, Bartolozzi, John Pine and George Vertue; _landscape-plates_, by\r\nwood engravers of the Bewick school (see Plate), &c. In most of these\r\nthe armorial element plays but a secondary part.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Book-plate of William Hewer, 1699.]\r\n\r\nThe value attached to book-plates, otherwise than as an object of purely\r\npersonal interest, is comparatively modern. The study of and the taste\r\nfor collecting these private tokens of book-ownership hardly date\r\nfarther back than the year 1875. The first real impetus was given by the\r\nappearance of the _Guide to the Study of Book-Plates_, by Lord de Tabley\r\n(then the Hon. Leicester Warren) in 1880. This work, highly interesting\r\nfrom many points of view, established what is now accepted as the\r\ngeneral classification of styles: _early armorial_ (i.e. previous to\r\nRestoration, exemplified by the Nicholas Bacon plate); _Jacobean_, a\r\nsomewhat misleading term, but distinctly understood to include the heavy\r\ndecorative manner of the Restoration, Queen Anne and early Georgian days\r\n(the Lansanor plate, fig. 5, is typically Jacobean); _Chippendale_ (the\r\nstyle above described as _rococo_, tolerably well represented by the\r\nFrench plate of Convers); _wreath and ribbon_, belonging to the period\r\ndescribed as that of the urn, &c. Since then the literature on the\r\nsubject has grown considerably. Societies of collectors have been\r\nfounded, first in England, then in Germany and France, and in the United\r\nStates, most of them issuing a journal or archives: _The Journal of the\r\nEx-libris Society_ (London), the _Archives de la societe francaise de\r\ncollectionneurs d'ex-libris_ (Paris), both of these monthlies; the\r\n_Ex-libris Zeitschrift_ (Berlin), a quarterly.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written for and against book-plate collecting. If, on the\r\none hand, the more enthusiastic ex-librists (for such a word has\r\nactually been coined) have made the somewhat ridiculous claim of science\r\nfor \"ex-librisme,\" the bitter animadversion, on the other, of a certain\r\nclass of intolerant bibliophiles upon the vandalism of removing\r\nbook-plates from old books has at times been rather extravagant.\r\nBook-plates are undoubtedly very often of high interest (and of a value\r\noften far greater than the odd volume in which they are found affixed),\r\neither as specimens of bygone decorative fashion or as personal relics\r\nof well-known personages. There can be no question, for instance, that\r\nengravings or designs by artists such as Holbein and Durer and the\r\nLittle Masters of Germany, by Charles Eisen, Hubert Francois\r\nBourguignon, _dit_ Gravelot, D.N. Chodowiecki or Simon Gribelin; by W.\r\nMarshall, W. Faithorne, David Loggan, Sir Robert Strange, Francesco\r\nPiranesi; by Hogarth, Cipriani, Bartolozzi, John Keyse Sherwin, William\r\nHenshaw, Hewitt or Bewick and his imitators; or, to come to modern\r\ntimes, that the occasional examples traced to the handicraft of Thomas\r\nStothard, Thackeray, Millais, Maclise, Bell Scott, T.G. Jackson, Walter\r\nCrane, Caldecott, Stacy Marks, Edwin Abbey, Kate Greenaway, Gordon\r\nBrowne, Herbert Railton, Aubrey Beardsley, Alfred Parsons, D.Y. Cameron,\r\nPaul Avril--are worth collecting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE.\r\n\r\n  BOOK-PLATE OF ROBERT PINKNEY. By Thoma Bewick.\r\n\r\n  BOOK-PLATE OF FREIHERR V. LIPPERHEIDE.

Sherborn.]\r\n\r\nUntil the advent of the new taste the devising of book-plates was almost\r\ninvariably left to the routine skill of the heraldic stationer. Of late\r\nyears the composition of personal book-tokens has become recognized as a\r\nminor branch of a higher art, and there has come into fashion an\r\nentirely new class of designs which, for all their wonderful variety,\r\nbear as unmistakable a character as that of the most definite styles of\r\nbygone days. Broadly speaking, it may be said that the purely heraldic\r\nelement tends to become subsidiary and the allegorical or symbolic to\r\nassert itself more strongly. Among modern English artists who have more\r\nspecially paid attention to the devising of book-plates, and have\r\nproduced admirable designs, may be mentioned C.W. Sherborn, G.W. Eve,\r\nRobert Anning Bell, J.D. Batten, Erat Harrison, J. Forbes Nixon, Charles\r\nRicketts, John Vinycomb, John Leighton and Warrington Hogg. The\r\ndevelopment in various directions of process work, by facilitating and\r\ncheapening the reproduction of beautiful and elaborate designs, has no\r\ndoubt helped much to popularize the book-plate--a thing which in older\r\ndays was almost invariably restricted to ancestral libraries or to\r\ncollections otherwise important. Thus the great majority of modern\r\nplates are reproduced by process. There are, however, a few artists left\r\nwho devote to book-plates their skill with the graver. Some of the work\r\nthey produce challenges comparison with the finest productions of bygone\r\nengravers. Of these the best-known are C.W. Sherborn (see Plate) and\r\nG.W. Eve in England, and in America J.W. Spenceley of Boston, Mass.,\r\nK.W.F. Hopson of New Haven, Conn., and E.D. French of New York City (see\r\nPlate).\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--The curious in the matter of book-plate composition will\r\n  find it treated in the various volumes of the Ex-libris Series\r\n  (London).

Ca.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK-SCORPION, or FALSE SCORPION, minute arachnids superficially\r\nresembling tailless scorpions and belonging to the order\r\nPseudoscorpiones of the class Arachnida. Occurring in all temperate and\r\ntropical countries, book-scorpions live for the most part under stones,\r\nbeneath the bark of trees or in vegetable detritus. A few species,\r\nhowever, like the common British forms _Chelifer cancroides_ and\r\n_Chiridium museorum_, frequent human dwellings and are found in books,\r\nold chests, furniture, &c; others like _Ganypus littoralis_ and allied\r\nspecies may be found under stones or pieces of coral between tide-marks;\r\nwhile others, which are for the most part blind, live permanently in\r\ndark caves. Their food consists of minute insects or mites. It is\r\npossibly for the purpose of feeding on parasitic mites that\r\nbook-scorpions lodge themselves beneath the wing-cases of large tropical\r\nbeetles; and the same explanation, in default of a better, may be\r\nextended to their well-known and oft-recorded habit of seizing hold of\r\nthe legs of horse-flies or other two-winged insects. For safety during\r\nhibernation and moulting, book-scorpions spin a small spherical cocoon.\r\nThey are oviparous; and the eggs after being laid are carried about by\r\nthe mother, attached to the lower surface of her body, the young\r\nremaining with their parent until they have acquired their definite\r\nform and are able to shift for themselves.     (R. I. P.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKSELLING. The trade in books is of a very ancient date. The early\r\npoets and orators recited their effusions in public to induce their\r\nhearers to possess written copies of their poems or orations. Frequently\r\nthey were taken down _viva voce_, and transcripts sold to such as were\r\nwealthy enough to purchase. In the book of Jeremiah the prophet is\r\nrepresented as dictating to Baruch the scribe, who, when questioned,\r\ndescribed the mode in which his book was written. These scribes were, in\r\nfact, the earliest booksellers, and supplied copies as they were\r\ndemanded. Aristotle, we are told, possessed a somewhat extensive\r\nlibrary; and Plato is recorded to have paid the large sum of one hundred\r\nminae for three small treatises of Philolaus the Pythagorean. When the\r\nAlexandrian library was founded about 300 B.C., various expedients were\r\nresorted to for the purpose of procuring books, and this appears to have\r\nstimulated the energies of the Athenian booksellers, who were termed\r\n[Greek: biblion kapaeloi]. In Rome, towards the end of the republic, it\r\nbecame the fashion to have a library as part of the household furniture;\r\nand the booksellers, _librarii_ (Cic. _D. Leg._ iii. 20) or\r\n_bibliopolae_ (Martial iv. 71, xiii. 3), carried on a flourishing trade.\r\nTheir shops (_taberna librarii_, Cicero, _Phil._ ii. 9) were chiefly in\r\nthe Argiletum, and in the Vicus Sandalarius. On the door, or on the side\r\nposts, was a list of the books on sale; and Martial (i. 118), who\r\nmentions this also, says that a copy of his First Book of Epigrams might\r\nbe purchased for five denarii. In the time of Augustus the great\r\nbooksellers were the Sosii. According to Justinian (ii. I. 33), a law\r\nwas passed securing to the scribes the property in the materials used;\r\nand in this may, perhaps, be traced the first germ of the modern law of\r\ncopyright.\r\n\r\nThe spread of Christianity naturally created a great demand for copies\r\nof the Gospels and other sacred books, and later on for missals and\r\nother devotional volumes for church and private use. Benedict Biscop,\r\nthe founder of the abbey at Wearmouth in England, brought home with him\r\nfrom France (671) a whole cargo of books, part of which he had \"bought,\"\r\nbut from whom is not mentioned. Passing by the intermediate ages we find\r\nthat previous to the Reformation, the text writers or stationers\r\n(_stacyoneres_), who sold copies of the books then in use--the ABC, the\r\nPaternoster, Creed, Ave Maria and other MS. copies of prayers, in the\r\nneighbourhood of St Paul's, London,--were, in 1403, formed into a gild.\r\nSome of these \"stacyoneres\" had stalls or stations built against the\r\nvery walls of the cathedral itself, in the same manner as they are still\r\nto be found in some of the older continental cities. In Henry Anstey's\r\n_Munimenta Academica_, published under the direction of the master of\r\nthe rolls, we catch a glimpse of the \"sworn\" university bookseller or\r\nstationer, John More of Oxford, who apparently first supplied pupils\r\nwith their books, and then acted the part of a pawnbroker. Anstey says\r\n(p. 77), \"The fact is that they (the students) mostly could not afford\r\nto buy books, and had they been able, would not have found the advantage\r\nso considerable as might be supposed, the instruction given being almost\r\nwholly oral. The chief source of supplying books was by purchase from\r\nthe university sworn stationers, who had to a great extent a monopoly.\r\nOf such books there were plainly very large numbers constantly changing\r\nhands.\" Besides the sworn stationers there were many booksellers in\r\nOxford who were not sworn; for one of the statutes, passed in the year\r\n1373, expressly recites that, in consequence of their presence, \"books\r\nof great value are sold and carried away from Oxford, the owners of them\r\nare cheated, and the sworn stationers are deprived of their lawful\r\nbusiness.\" It was, therefore, enacted that no bookseller except two\r\nsworn stationers or their deputies, should sell any book being either\r\nhis own property or that of another, exceeding half a mark in value,\r\nunder a pain of imprisonment, or, if the offence was repeated, of\r\nabjuring his trade within the university.\r\n\r\n\"The trade in bookselling seems,\" says Hallam, \"to have been established\r\nat Paris and Bologna in the 12th century; the lawyers and universities\r\ncalled it into life. It is very improbable that it existed in what we\r\nproperly call the dark ages. Peter of Blois mentions a book which he\r\nhad bought of a public dealer (_a quodam publico mangone librorum_); but\r\nwe do not find many distinct accounts of them till the next age. These\r\ndealers were denominated _stationarii_, perhaps from the open stalls at\r\nwhich they carried on their business, though _statio_ is a general word\r\nfor a shop in low Latin. They appear, by the old statutes of the\r\nuniversity of Paris, and by those of Bologna, to have sold books upon\r\ncommission, and are sometimes, though not uniformly, distinguished from\r\nthe _librarii_, a word which, having originally been confined to the\r\ncopyists of books, was afterwards applied to those who traded in them.\r\nThey sold parchment and other materials of writing, which have retained\r\nthe name of stationery, and they naturally exercised the kindred\r\noccupations of binding and decorating. They probably employed\r\ntranscribers; we find at least that there was a profession of copyists\r\nin the universities and in large cities.\"\r\n\r\nThe modern system of bookselling dates from soon after the introduction\r\nof printing. The earliest printers were also editors and booksellers;\r\nbut being unable to sell every copy of the works they printed, they had\r\nagents at most of the seats of learning. Antony Koburger, who introduced\r\nthe art of printing into Nuremberg in 1470, although a printer, was more\r\nof a bookseller; for, besides his own sixteen shops, we are informed by\r\nhis biographers that he had agents for the sale of his books in every\r\ncity of Christendom. Wynkyn de Worde, who succeeded to Caxton's press in\r\nWestminster, had a shop in Fleet Street.\r\n\r\nThe religious dissensions of the continent, and the Reformation in\r\nEngland under Henry VIII. and Edward VI., created a great demand for\r\nbooks; but in England neither Tudor nor Stuart could tolerate a free\r\npress, and various efforts were made to curb it. The first patent for\r\nthe office of king's printer was granted to Thomas Berthelet by Henry\r\nVIII. in 1529, but only such books as were first licensed were to be\r\nprinted. At that time even the purchase or possession of an unlicensed\r\nbook was a punishable offence. In 1556 the Company of Stationers was\r\nincorporated, and very extensive powers were granted in order that\r\nobnoxious books might be repressed. In the following reigns the Star\r\nChamber exercised a pretty effectual censorship; but, in spite of all\r\nprecaution, such was the demand for books of a polemical nature, that\r\nmany were printed abroad and surreptitiously introduced into England.\r\nQueen Elizabeth interfered but little with books except when they\r\nemanated from Roman Catholics, or touched upon her royal prerogatives;\r\nand towards the end of her reign, and during that of her pedantic\r\nsuccessor, James, bookselling flourished. Archbishop Laud, who was no\r\nfriend to booksellers, introduced many arbitrary restrictions; but they\r\nwere all, or nearly all, removed during the time of the Commonwealth. So\r\nmuch had bookselling increased during the Protectorate that, in 1658,\r\nwas published _A Catalogue of the most Vendible Books in England,\r\ndigested under the heads of Divinity, History, Physic, &c., with School\r\nBooks, Hebrew, Greek and Latin, and an Introduction, for the use of\r\nSchools_, by W. London. A bad time immediately followed. The Restoration\r\nalso restored the office of Licenser of the Press, which continued till\r\n1694.\r\n\r\nIn the first English Copyright Act (1709), which specially relates to\r\nbooksellers, it is enacted that, if any person shall think the published\r\nprice of a book unreasonably high, he may thereupon make complaint to\r\nthe archbishop of Canterbury, and to certain other persons named, who\r\nshall thereupon examine into his complaint, and if well founded reduce\r\nthe price; and any bookseller charging more than the price so fixed\r\nshall be fined L5 for every copy sold. Apparently this enactment\r\nremained a dead letter.\r\n\r\nFor later times it is necessary to make a gradual distinction between\r\n_booksellers_, whose trade consists in selling books, either by retail\r\nor wholesale, and _publishers_, whose business involves the production\r\nof the books from the author's manuscripts, and who are the\r\nintermediaries between author and bookseller, just as the booksellers\r\n(in the restricted sense) are intermediaries between the author and\r\npublisher and the public. The article on PUBLISHING (q.v.) deals more\r\nparticularly with this second class, who, though originally booksellers,\r\ngradually took a higher rank in the book-trade, and whose influence\r\nupon the history of literature has often been very great. The\r\nconvenience of this distinction is not impaired by the fact either that\r\na publisher is also a wholesale bookseller, or that a still more recent\r\ndevelopment in publishing (as in the instance of the direct sale in\r\n1902, by the London _Times_, of the supplementary volumes to the 9th\r\nedition of the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_, which were also \"published\"\r\nby _The Times_) started a reaction to some extent in the way of\r\namalgamating the two functions. The scheme of _The Times_ Book Club\r\n(started in 1905) was, again, a combination of a subscription library\r\nwith the business of bookselling (see NEWSPAPERS); and it brought the\r\norganization of a newspaper, with all its means of achieving publicity,\r\ninto the work of pushing the sale of books, in a way which practically\r\nintroduced a new factor into the bookselling business.\r\n\r\nDuring the 19th century it remains the fact that the distinction between\r\npublisher and bookseller--literary promoter and shopkeeper--became\r\nfundamental. The booksellers, as such, were engaged either in wholesale\r\nbookselling, or in the retail, the old or second-hand, and the\r\nperiodical trades.\r\n\r\n  Coming between the publisher and the retail bookseller is the\r\n  important distributing agency of the _wholesale bookseller_. It is to\r\n  him that the retailer looks for his miscellaneous supplies, as it is\r\n  simply impossible for him to stock one-half of the books published. In\r\n  Paternoster Row, London, which has for over a hundred years been the\r\n  centre of this industry, may be seen the collectors from the shops of\r\n  the retail booksellers, busily engaged in obtaining the books ordered\r\n  by the book-buying public. It is also through these agencies that the\r\n  country bookseller obtains his miscellaneous supplies. At the leading\r\n  house in this department of bookselling almost any book can be found,\r\n  or information obtained concerning it. At one of these establishments\r\n  over 1,000,000 books are constantly kept in stock. It is here that the\r\n  publisher calls first on showing or \"subscribing\" a new book, a\r\n  critical process, for by the number thus subscribed the fate of a book\r\n  is sometimes determined.\r\n\r\n  What may be termed the third partner in publishing and its\r\n  ramification is the _retail bookseller_; and to protect his interests\r\n  there was established in 1890 a London booksellers' society, which had\r\n  for its object the restriction of discounts to 25%, and also to\r\n  arrange prices generally and control all details connected with the\r\n  trade. The society a few years afterwards widened its field of\r\n  operations so as to include the whole of the United Kingdom, and its\r\n  designation then became \"The Associated Booksellers of Great Britain\r\n  and Ireland.\"\r\n\r\n  The trade in old or (as they are sometimes called) second-hand books\r\n  is in a sense, no doubt, a higher class of business, requiring a\r\n  knowledge of bibliography, while the transactions are with individual\r\n  books rather than with numbers of copies. Occasionally dealers in this\r\n  class of books replenish their stocks by purchasing remainders of\r\n  books, which, having ceased from one cause or another to sell with the\r\n  publisher, they offer to the public as bargains. The periodical trade\r\n  grew up during the 19th century, and was in its infancy when the\r\n  _Penny Magazine_, _Chambers's Journal_, and similar publications first\r\n  appeared. The growth of this important part of the business was\r\n  greatly promoted by the abolition of the newspaper stamp and of the\r\n  duty upon paper, the introduction of attractive illustrations, and the\r\n  facilities offered for purchasing books by instalments.\r\n\r\nThe history of bookselling in America has a special interest. The\r\nSpanish settlements drew away from the old country much of its\r\nenterprise and best talent, and the presses of Mexico and other cities\r\nteemed with publications mostly of a religious character, but many\r\nothers, especially linguistic and historical, were also published.\r\nBookselling in the United States was of a somewhat later growth,\r\nalthough printing was introduced into Boston as early as 1676,\r\nPhiladelphia in 1685, and New York in 1693. Franklin had served to make\r\nthe trade illustrious, yet few persons were engaged in it at the\r\ncommencement of the 19th century. Books chiefly for scholars and\r\nlibraries were imported from Europe; but after the second war\r\nprinting-presses multiplied rapidly, and with the spread of newspapers\r\nand education there also arose a demand for books, and publishers set to\r\nwork to secure the advantages offered by the wide field of English\r\nliterature, the whole of which they had the liberty of reaping free of\r\nall cost beyond that of production. The works of Scott, Byron, Moore,\r\nSouthey, Wordsworth, and indeed of every author of note, were reprinted\r\nwithout the smallest payment to author or proprietor. Half the names of\r\nthe authors in the so-called \"American\" catalogue of books printed\r\nbetween 1820 and 1852 are British. By this means the works of the best\r\nauthors were brought to the doors of all classes in the cheapest\r\nvariety of forms. In consequence of the Civil War, the high price of\r\nlabour, and the restrictive duties laid on in order to protect native\r\nindustry, coupled with the frequent intercourse with England, a great\r\nchange took place, and American publishers and booksellers, while there\r\nwas still no international copyright, made liberal offers for early\r\nsheets of new publications. Boston, New York and Philadelphia still\r\nretained their old supremacy as bookselling centres. Meanwhile, the\r\ndistinct publishing business also grew, till gradually the conditions of\r\nbusiness became assimilated to those of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the 16th and 17th centuries the Low Countries for a\r\ntime became the chief centre of the bookselling world, and many of the\r\nfinest folios and quartos in our libraries bear the names of Jansen,\r\nBlauw or Plantin, with the imprint of Amsterdam, Utrecht, Leiden or\r\nAntwerp, while the Elzevirs besides other works produced their charming\r\nlittle pocket classics. The southern towns of Douai and St Omer at the\r\nsame time furnished polemical works in English.\r\n\r\n  Under PUBLISHING are noticed various further developments of this\r\n  subject. Much interesting information on the history of the book trade\r\n  will be found in Charles Knight's _Biography of William Caxton_, and\r\n  in the same author's _Shadows of the Old Booksellers_ (1865). See also\r\n  Henry Curwen, _History of Booksellers_ (1873); and Heinrich Lempertz,\r\n  _Bilder-Hefte zur Geschichte des Bucherhandels_ (Cologne, 1854).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOLE, GEORGE (1815-1864), English logician and mathematician, was born\r\nin Lincoln on the 2nd of November 1815. His father was a tradesman of\r\nlimited means, but of studious character and active mind. Being\r\nespecially interested in mathematical science, the father gave his son\r\nhis first lessons; but the extraordinary mathematical powers of George\r\nBoole did not manifest themselves in early life. At first his favourite\r\nsubject was classics. Not until the age of seventeen did he attack the\r\nhigher mathematics, and his progress was much retarded by the want of\r\nefficient help. When about sixteen years of age he became\r\nassistant-master in a private school at Doncaster, and he maintained\r\nhimself to the end of his life in one grade or other of the scholastic\r\nprofession. Few distinguished men, indeed, have had a less eventful\r\nlife. Almost the only changes which can be called events are his\r\nsuccessful establishment of a school at Lincoln, its removal to\r\nWaddington, his appointment in 1849 as professor of mathematics in the\r\nQueen's College at Cork, and his marriage in 1855 to Miss Mary Everest,\r\nwho, as Mrs Boole, afterwards wrote several useful educational works on\r\nher husband's principles.\r\n\r\nTo the public Boole was known only as the author of numerous abstruse\r\npapers on mathematical topics, and of three or four distinct\r\npublications which have become standard works. His earliest published\r\npaper was one upon the \"Theory of Analytical Transformations,\" printed\r\nin the _Cambridge Mathematical Journal_ for 1839, and it led to a\r\nfriendship between Boole and D.F. Gregory, the editor of the journal,\r\nwhich lasted until the premature death of the latter in 1844. A long\r\nlist of Boole's memoirs and detached papers, both on logical and\r\nmathematical topics, will be found in the _Catalogue of Scientific\r\nMemoirs_ published by the Royal Society, and in the supplementary volume\r\non _Differential Equations_, edited by Isaac Todhunter. To the\r\n_Cambridge Mathematical Journal_ and its successor, the _Cambridge and\r\nDublin Mathematical Journal_, Boole contributed in all twenty-two\r\narticles. In the third and fourth series of the _Philosophical Magazine_\r\nwill be found sixteen papers. The Royal Society printed six important\r\nmemoirs in the _Philosophical Transactions_, and a few other memoirs are\r\nto be found in the _Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh_ and\r\nof the _Royal Irish Academy_, in the _Bulletin de l'Academie de\r\nSt-Petersbourg_ for 1862 (under the name G. Boldt, vol. iv. pp.\r\n198-215), and in _Crelle's Journal_. To these lists should be added a\r\npaper on the mathematical basis of logic, published in the _Mechanic's\r\nMagazine_ for 1848. The works of Boole are thus contained in about fifty\r\nscattered articles and a few separate publications.\r\n\r\nOnly two systematic treatises on mathematical subjects were completed by\r\nBoole during his lifetime. The well-known _Treatise on Differential\r\nEquations_ appeared in 1859, and was followed, the next year, by a\r\n_Treatise on the Calculus of Finite Differences_, designed to serve as a\r\nsequel to the former work. These treatises are valuable contributions to\r\nthe important branches of mathematics in question, and Boole, in\r\ncomposing them, seems to have combined elementary exposition with the\r\nprofound investigation of the philosophy of the subject in a manner\r\nhardly admitting of improvement. To a certain extent these works embody\r\nthe more important discoveries of their author. In the 16th and 17th\r\nchapters of the _Differential Equations_ we find, for instance, a lucid\r\naccount of the general symbolic method, the bold and skilful employment\r\nof which led to Boole's chief discoveries, and of a general method in\r\nanalysis, originally described in his famous memoir printed in the\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_ for 1844. Boole was one of the most eminent\r\nof those who perceived that the symbols of operation could be separated\r\nfrom those of quantity and treated as distinct objects of calculation.\r\nHis principal characteristic was perfect confidence in any result\r\nobtained by the treatment of symbols in accordance with their primary\r\nlaws and conditions, and an almost unrivalled skill and power in tracing\r\nout these results.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years of his life Boole was constantly engaged in\r\nextending his researches with the object of producing a second edition\r\nof his _Differential Equations_ much more complete than the first\r\nedition; and part of his last vacation was spent in the libraries of the\r\nRoyal Society and the British Museum. But this new edition was never\r\ncompleted. Even the manuscripts left at his death were so incomplete\r\nthat Todhunter, into whose hands they were put, found it impossible to\r\nuse them in the publication of a second edition of the original\r\ntreatise, and wisely printed them, in 1865, in a supplementary volume.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Augustus de Morgan, Boole was probably the first\r\nEnglish mathematician since the time of John Wallis who had also written\r\nupon logic. His novel views of logical method were due to the same\r\nprofound confidence in symbolic reasoning to which he had successfully\r\ntrusted in mathematical investigation. Speculations concerning a\r\ncalculus of reasoning had at different times occupied Boole's thoughts,\r\nbut it was not till the spring of 1847 that he put his ideas into the\r\npamphlet called _Mathematical Analysis of Logic_. Boole afterwards\r\nregarded this as a hasty and imperfect exposition of his logical system,\r\nand he desired that his much larger work, _An Investigation of the Laws\r\nof Thought, on which are founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and\r\nProbabilities_ (1854), should alone be considered as containing a mature\r\nstatement of his views. Nevertheless, there is a charm of originality\r\nabout his earlier logical work which no competent reader can fail to\r\nappreciate. He did not regard logic as a branch of mathematics, as the\r\ntitle of his earlier pamphlet might be taken to imply, but he pointed\r\nout such a deep analogy between the symbols of algebra and those which\r\ncan be made, in his opinion, to represent logical forms and syllogisms,\r\nthat we can hardly help saying that logic is mathematics restricted to\r\nthe two quantities, 0 and 1. By unity Boole denoted the universe of\r\nthinkable objects; literal symbols, such as x, y, z, v, u, &c., were\r\nused with the elective meaning attaching to common adjectives and\r\nsubstantives. Thus, if x=horned and y=sheep, then the successive acts of\r\nelection represented by x and y, if performed on unity, give the whole\r\nof the class _horned sheep_. Boole showed that elective symbols of this\r\nkind obey the same primary laws of combination as algebraical symbols,\r\nwhence it followed that they could be added, subtracted, multiplied and\r\neven divided, almost exactly in the same manner as numbers. Thus, 1 - x\r\nwould represent the operation of selecting all things in the world\r\nexcept _horned things_, that is, _all not horned things_, and (1 - x)(1\r\n- y) would give us _all things neither horned nor sheep_. By the use of\r\nsuch symbols propositions could be reduced to the form of equations, and\r\nthe syllogistic conclusion from two premises was obtained by eliminating\r\nthe middle term according to ordinary algebraic rules.\r\n\r\nStill more original and remarkable, however, was that part of his\r\nsystem, fully stated in his _Laws of Thought_, which formed a general\r\nsymbolic method of logical inference. Given any propositions involving\r\nany number of terms, Boole showed how, by the purely symbolic treatment\r\nof the premises, to draw any conclusion logically contained in those\r\npremises. The second part of the _Laws of Thought_ contained a\r\ncorresponding attempt to discover a general method in probabilities,\r\nwhich should enable us from the given probabilities of any system of\r\nevents to determine the consequent probability of any other event\r\nlogically connected with the given events.\r\n\r\nThough Boole published little except his mathematical and logical works,\r\nhis acquaintance with general literature was wide and deep. Dante was\r\nhis favourite poet, and he preferred the _Paradiso_ to the _Inferno_.\r\nThe metaphysics of Aristotle, the ethics of Spinoza, the philosophical\r\nworks of Cicero, and many kindred works, were also frequent subjects of\r\nstudy. His reflections upon scientific, philosophical and religious\r\nquestions are contained in four addresses upon _The Genius of Sir Isaac\r\nNewton_, _The Right Use of Leisure_, _The Claims of Science_ and _The\r\nSocial Aspect of Intellectual Culture_, which he delivered and printed\r\nat different times.\r\n\r\nThe personal character of Boole inspired all his friends with the\r\ndeepest esteem. He was marked by the modesty of true genius, and his\r\nlife was given to the single-minded pursuit of truth. Though he received\r\na medal from the Royal Society for his memoir of 1844, and the honorary\r\ndegree of LL.D. from the university of Dublin, he neither sought nor\r\nreceived the ordinary rewards to which his discoveries would entitle\r\nhim. On the 8th of December 1864, in the full vigour of his intellectual\r\npowers, he died of an attack of fever, ending in suffusion on the lungs.\r\n\r\n  An excellent sketch of his life and works, by the Rev. R. Harley,\r\n  F.R.S., is to be found in the _British Quarterly Review_ for July\r\n  1866, No. 87.     (W. S. J.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOM, a word of Teutonic origin (cf. the Ger. _Baum_, tree, and the Eng.\r\n_beam_) for a pole, bar or barrier, used especially as a nautical term,\r\nfor a long spar, used to extend a sail at the foot (main-boom, jib-boom,\r\n&c.). The \"boom\" of a cannon (note of a bell, cry of the bittern) is\r\ndistinct from this, being onomatopoeic. In the sense of a barrier, a\r\nboom is generally formed of timber lashed together, or of chains, built\r\nacross the mouth of a river or harbour as a means of defence. Possibly\r\nfrom the metaphor of a breaking boom, and the accompanying rush and\r\nroar, or from the rush of rising waters (mingled with the onomatopoeic\r\nuse), \"boom\" began in America to be used of a sudden \"spurt\" or access\r\nof industrial activity, as in the phrase \"a boom in cotton.\" Hence the\r\nverb \"to boom,\" meaning to advertise or push into public favour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOMERANG, a missile weapon of the Australian aborigines and other\r\npeoples. The word is taken from the native name used by a single tribe\r\nin New South Wales, and was mentioned in 1827 by Captain King as \"the\r\nPort Jackson term\" (_Nav. Surv. Coasts Austral._ i. 355) It has been\r\nerroneously connected with the _womera_ or spear-thrower, and equally\r\nerroneously regarded as onomatopoeic--for it does not \"boom\" but\r\nwhistles in the air. Two main types may be distinguished: (a) the return\r\nboomerang; (b) the non-return or war boomerang. Both types are found in\r\nmost parts of Australia; the return form was, according to General\r\nPitt-Rivers, used in ancient Egypt; and a weapon which has a close\r\nresemblance to the boomerang survives to the present day in North-East\r\nAfrica, whence it has spread in allied forms made of metal (throwing\r\nknives). Among the Dravidians of South India is found a boomerang-shaped\r\ninstrument which can be made to return. It is, however, still uncertain\r\nwhether the so-called boomerangs of Egypt and India have any real\r\nresemblance to the Australian return boomerang. The Hopis (Moquis) of\r\nArizona use a non-return form. The general form of both weapons is the\r\nsame. They are sickle-shaped, and made of wood (in India of ivory or\r\nsteel), so modelled that the thickness is about 1/6th of the breadth,\r\nwhich again is 1/12th of the length, the last varying from 6 in. to 3 or\r\n4 ft. The return boomerang, which may have two straight arms at an angle\r\nof from 70 deg. to 120 deg., but in Australia is always curved at an\r\nangle of 90 deg. or more, is usually 2 to 3 ft. in length and weighs\r\nsome 8 oz.; the arms have a skew, being twisted 2 deg. or 3 deg. from\r\nthe plane running through the centre of the weapon, so that B and D\r\n(fig. 1) are above it, A and E below it; the ends AB and DE are also to\r\nsome extent raised above the plane of the weapon at C; the cross section\r\nis asymmetrical, the upper side in the figure being convex, the lower\r\nflat or nearly so; this must be thrown with the right hand. The\r\nnon-return boomerang has a skew in the opposite direction but is\r\notherwise similar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of the boomerang's flight depends mainly on its skew.\r\nThe return boomerang is held vertically, the concave side forward, and\r\nthrown in a plane parallel to the surface of the ground, as much\r\nrotation as possible being imparted to it. It travels straight for 30\r\nyds. or more, with nearly vertical rotation; then it inclines to the\r\nleft, lying over on the flat side and rising in the air; after\r\ndescribing a circle of 50 or more yards in diameter it returns to the\r\nthrower. Some observers state that it returns after striking the object;\r\nit is certainly possible to strike the ground without affecting the\r\nreturn. Throws of 100 yds. or more, before the leftward curve begins,\r\ncan be accomplished by Australian natives, the weapon rising as much as\r\n150 ft. in the air and circling five times before returning. The\r\nnon-return type may also be made to return in a nearly straight line by\r\nthrowing it at an angle of 45 deg., but normally it is thrown like the\r\nreturn type, and will then travel an immense distance. No accurate\r\nmeasurements of Australian throws are available, but an English throw of\r\n180 yds. has been recorded, compared with the same thrower's 70 yds.\r\nwith the cricket ball.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Flight in Horizontal Plane.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Flight in Vertical Plane.]\r\n\r\nThe war boomerang in an expert's hand is a deadly weapon, and the\r\nlighter hunting boomerang is also effective. The return boomerang is\r\nchiefly used as a plaything or for killing birds, and is often as\r\ndangerous to the thrower as to the object at which it is aimed.\r\n\r\n  See Pitt-Rivers (Lane Fox) in _Anthropological and Archaeological\r\n  Fragments_, \"Primitive Warfare\"; also in _Journ.

T.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOONE, DANIEL (1734-1820), American pioneer and backwoodsman, of English\r\ndescent, was born near the present city of Reading, Pennsylvania, on the\r\n2nd of November (N.S.) 1734. About 1751 his father, Squire Boone, with\r\nhis family settled in the Yadkin Valley in what is now Davie county,\r\nNorth Carolina, then on the frontier. Daniel worked on his father's\r\nfarm, and spent much of his time hunting and trapping. In 1755 he served\r\nas a wagoner and blacksmith in Braddock's disastrous expedition against\r\nthe Indians. In 1765 he visited Florida, and in 1767 he first visited\r\nthe Kentucky region. With several companions, including John Finley, who\r\nhad been there as early as 1752, he spent two years, 1769-1771, roaming\r\nabout what is now Kentucky, meeting with numberless adventures, coming\r\nin conflict with roving bands of Indians, and collecting bear, beaver\r\nand deer skins. He served in Lord Dunmore's War (1774), and in 1775 led\r\nto Kentucky the party of settlers who founded Boonesborough, long an\r\nimportant settlement. On the 7th of February 1778 he, and the party he\r\nled, were captured by a band of Shawnees. He was adopted into the\r\nShawnee tribe, was taken to Detroit, and on the return from that place\r\nescaped, reaching Boonesborough, after a perilous journey of 160 m.,\r\nwithin four days, in time to give warning of a formidable attack by his\r\ncaptors. In repelling this attack, which lasted from the 8th to the 17th\r\nof September, he bore a conspicuous part. He also took part in the\r\nsanguinary \"Battle of Blue Licks\" in 1782. For a time he represented the\r\nsettlers in the Virginia legislature (Kentucky then being a part of\r\nVirginia), and he also served as deputy surveyor, sheriff and county\r\nlieutenant of Fayette county, one of the three counties into which\r\nKentucky was then divided. Having lost all his land through his\r\ncarelessness in regard to titles, he removed in 1788 to Point Pleasant,\r\nVirginia (now W. Va.), whence about 1799 he removed to a place in what\r\nis now Missouri, about 45 m. west of St Louis, in territory then owned\r\nby Spain. He received a grant of 1000 arpents (about 845 acres) of land,\r\nand was appointed syndic of the district. After the United States gained\r\npossession of \"Louisiana\" in 1803, Boone's title was found to be\r\ndefective, and he was again dispossessed. He died on the 22nd of\r\nSeptember 1820, and in 1845 his remains were removed to Frankfort,\r\nKentucky, where a monument has been erected to his memory. Boone was a\r\ntypical American pioneer and backwoodsman, a great hunter and trapper,\r\nhighly skilled in all the arts of woodcraft, familiar with the Indians\r\nand their methods of warfare, a famous Indian fighter, restless,\r\nresourceful and fearless. His services, however, have been greatly\r\nover-estimated, and he was not, as is popularly believed, either the\r\nfirst to explore or the first to settle the Kentucky region.\r\n\r\n  The best biography is that by Reuben G. Thwaites, _Daniel Boone_ (New\r\n  York, 1902).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOONE, a city and the county-seat of Boone county, Iowa, U.S.A., a short\r\ndistance from the Des Moines river and near the centre of the state.\r\nPop. (1890) 6520; (1900) 8880; (1905, state census) 9500 (1334\r\nforeign-born); (1910) 10,347. It is served by the Chicago &\r\nNorth-Western (which has construction and repair shops here), the\r\nChicago, Milwaukee & St Paul railways, and by the Fort Dodge, Des Moines\r\n& Southern (inter-urban) railway, which connects with Des Moines, Ames,\r\n&c. Boone is an important coal centre; bricks and tiles are manufactured\r\nfrom the clay obtained near by; there is a packing plant for the\r\nmanufacture of beef and pork products; and from the rich farming section\r\nby which the city is surrounded come large quantities of grain, some of\r\nwhich is milled here, and live-stock. Boone was laid out in 1865, was\r\nincorporated as a town in 1866, and was chartered as a city in 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOONVILLE, a city and the county-seat of Cooper county, Missouri,\r\nU.S.A., on the right bank of the Missouri river, about 210 m. W. by N.\r\nof St Louis. Pop. (1890) 4141; (1900) 4377, including 1111 negroes;\r\n(1910) 4252. It is served by the Missouri Pacific, and the Missouri,\r\nKansas & Texas railways. The city lies along a bluff about 100 ft. above\r\nthe river. It is the seat of the Missouri training school for boys\r\n(1889), and of the Kemper military school (1844). Among its manufactures\r\nare earthenware, tobacco, vinegar, flour, farm-gates (iron), sash and\r\ndoors, marble and granite monuments, carriages and bricks. Iron, zinc\r\nand lead are found in the vicinity, and some coal is mined. Boonville,\r\nnamed in honour of Daniel Boone, was settled in 1810, was laid out in\r\n1817, incorporated as a village in 1839, and chartered as a city of the\r\nthird class in 1896. Here on the 17th of June 1861, Captain\r\n(Major-General) Nathaniel Lyon, commanding about 2000 Union troops,\r\ndefeated a slightly larger, but undisciplined Confederate force under\r\nBrigadier-General John S. Marmaduke. David Barton (d. 1837), one of the\r\nfirst two United States senators from Missouri, was buried here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOORDE (or BORDE), ANDREW (1490?-1549), English physician and author,\r\nwas born at Boord's Hill, Holms Dale, Sussex. He was educated at Oxford,\r\nand was admitted a member of the Carthusian order while under age. In\r\n1521 he was \"dispensed from religion\" in order that he might act as\r\nsuffragan bishop of Chichester, though he never actually filled the\r\noffice, and in 1529 he was freed from his monastic vows, not being able\r\nto endure, as he said, the \"rugorosite off your relygyon.\" He then went\r\nabroad to study medicine, and on his return was summoned to attend the\r\nduke of Norfolk. He subsequently visited the universities of Orleans,\r\nPoitiers, Toulouse, Montpellier and Wittenberg, saw the practice of\r\nsurgery at Rome, and went on pilgrimage with others of his nation to\r\nCompostella in Navarre. In 1534 Boorde was again in London at the\r\nCharterhouse, and in 1536 wrote to Thomas Cromwell, complaining that he\r\nwas in \"thraldom\" there. Cromwell set him at liberty, and after\r\nentertaining him at his house at Bishops Waltham in Hampshire, seems to\r\nhave entrusted him with a mission to find out the state of public\r\nfeeling abroad with regard to the English king. He writes to Cromwell\r\nfrom various places, and from Catalonia he sends him the seeds of\r\nrhubarb, two hundred years before that plant was generally cultivated in\r\nEngland. Two letters in 1535 and 1536 to the prior of the Charterhouse\r\nanxiously argue for his complete release from monastic vows. In 1536 he\r\nwas studying medicine at Glasgow and gathering his observations about\r\nthe Scots and the \"devellyshe dysposicion of a Scottysh man, not to love\r\nnor favour an Englishe man.\" About 1538 Boorde set out on his most\r\nextensive journey, visiting nearly all the countries of Europe except\r\nRussia and Turkey, and making his way to Jerusalem. Of these travels he\r\nwrote a full itinerary, lost unfortunately by Cromwell, to whom it was\r\nsent. He finally settled at Montpellier and before 1542 had completed\r\nhis _Fyrst Boke of the Introduction of Knowledge_, which ranks as the\r\nearliest continental guide book, his _Dietary_ and his _Brevyary_. He\r\nprobably returned to England in 1542, and lived at Winchester and\r\nperhaps at Pevensey. John Ponet, bishop of Winchester, in an _Apology_\r\nagainst Bishop Gardiner, relates as matter of common knowledge that in\r\n1547 Doctor Boord, a physician and a holy man, who still kept the\r\nCarthusian rules of fasting and wearing a hair shirt, was convicted in\r\nWinchester of keeping in his house three loose women. For this offence,\r\napparently, he was imprisoned in the Fleet, where he made his will on\r\nthe 9th of April 1549. It was proved on the 25th of the same month.\r\nThomas Hearne (_Benedictus Abbas_, i, p. 52) says that he went round\r\nlike a quack doctor to country fairs, and therefore rashly supposed him\r\nto have been the original merry-andrew.\r\n\r\nAndrew Boorde was no doubt a learned physician, and he has left two\r\namusing and often sensible works on domestic hygiene and medicine, but\r\nhis most entertaining book is _The Fyrst Boke of the Introduction of\r\nKnowledge. The whyche dothe teache a man to speake parte of all maner of\r\nlanguages, and to know the usage and fashion of all maner of countreys.\r\nAnd for to know the moste parte of all maner of coynes of money, the\r\nwhych is currant in every region. Made by Andrew Borde, of Physycke\r\nDoctor. Dedycated to the right honourable, and gracious lady Mary\r\ndaughter of our soverayne Lorde Kyng Henry the eyght_ (c. 1547). The\r\nEnglishman describes himself and his foibles--his fickleness, his\r\nfondness for new fashions and his obstinacy--in lively verse. Then\r\nfollows a geographical description of the country, followed by a model\r\ndialogue in the Cornish language. Each country in turn is dealt with on\r\nsimilar lines. His other authentic works are: _Here foloweth a\r\nCompendyous Regimente or Dyetary of health, made in Mountpyllor_ (Thomas\r\nColwell, 1562), of which there are undated and doubtless earlier\r\neditions; _The Brevyary of Health_ (1547?); _The Princyples of\r\nAstronamy_ (1547?); \"The Peregrination of Doctor Board,\" printed by\r\nThomas Hearne in _Benedictus Abbas Petroburgensis_, vol. ii. (1735); _A\r\nPronostycacyon or an Almanacke for the yere of our lorde MCCCCCXLV. made\r\nby Andrew Boorde_. His _Itinerary of Europe_ and _Treatyse upon Berdes_\r\nare lost. Several jest-books are attributed to him without\r\nauthority--_The Merie Tales of the Mad Men of Gotam_ (earliest extant\r\nedition, 1630), _Scogin's Jests_ (1626), _A mery jest of the Mylner of\r\nAbyngton, with his wyfe, and his daughter, and of two poore scholers of\r\nCambridge_ (printed by Wynkyn de Worde), and a Latin poem, _Nos\r\nVagabunduli_.\r\n\r\n  See Dr F.J. Furnivall's reprint of the _Introduction_ and some other\r\n  selections for the Early English Text Society (new series, 1870).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOS, MARTIN (1762-1825), German Roman Catholic theologian, was born at\r\nHuttenried in Bavaria on the 25th of December 1762. Orphaned at the age\r\nof four, he was reared by an uncle at Augsburg, who finally sent him to\r\nthe university of Dillingen. There he laid the foundation of the modest\r\npiety by which his whole life was distinguished. After serving as priest\r\nin several Bavarian towns, he made his way in 1799 to Linz in Austria,\r\nwhere he was welcomed by Bishop Gall, and set to work first at Leonding\r\nand then at Waldneukirchen, becoming in 1806 pastor at Gallneukirchen.\r\nHis pietistic movement won considerable way among the Catholic laity,\r\nand even attracted some fifty or sixty priests. The death of Gall and\r\nother powerful friends, however, exposed him to bitter enmity and\r\npersecution from about 1812, and he had to answer endless accusations in\r\nthe consistorial courts. His enemies followed him when he returned to\r\nBavaria, but in 1817 the Prussian government appointed him to a\r\nprofessorship at Dusseldorf, and in 1819 gave him the pastorate at Sayn\r\nnear Neuwied. He died on the 29th of August 1825.\r\n\r\n  See _Life_ by J. Gossner (1831).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOT, (1) (From the O. Eng. _bot_, a word common to Teutonic languages,\r\ne.g. Goth, _bota_, \"good, advantage,\" O.H.G. _Buoza_, Mod. Ger.\r\n_Busse_, \"penance, fine\"; cf. \"better,\" the comparative of \"good\"),\r\nprofit or advantage. The word survives in \"bootless,\" i.e. useless or\r\nunavailing, and in such expressions, chiefly archaistic, as \"what boots\r\nit?\" \"Bote,\" an old form, survives in some old compound legal words,\r\nsuch as \"house-bote,\" \"fire-bote,\" \"hedge-bote,\" &c., for particular\r\nrights of \"estover,\" the Norman French word corresponding to the Saxon\r\n\"bote\" (see ESTOVERS and COMMONS). The same form survives also in such\r\nexpressions as \"thief-bote\" for the Old English customary compensation\r\npaid for injuries.\r\n\r\n(2) (A word of uncertain origin, which came into English through the O.\r\nFr. _bote_, modern _botte_; Med. Lat. _botta_ or _bota_), a covering for\r\nthe foot. Properly a boot covers the whole lower part of the leg,\r\nsometimes reaching to or above the knee, but in common usage it is\r\napplied to one which reaches only above the ankle, and is thus\r\ndistinguished from \"shoe\" (see COSTUME and SHOE).\r\n\r\nThe \"boot\" of a coach has the same derivation. It was originally applied\r\nto the fixed outside step, the French _botte_, then to the uncovered\r\nspaces on or beside the step on which the attendants sat facing\r\nsideways. Both senses are now obsolete, the term now being applied to\r\nthe covered receptacles under the seats of the guard and coachman.\r\n\r\nTHE BOOT, BOOTS or BOOTIKIN was an instrument of torture formerly in use\r\nto extort confessions from suspected persons, or obtain evidence from\r\nunwilling witnesses. It originated in Scotland, but the date of its\r\nfirst use is unknown. It was certainly frequently employed there in the\r\nlatter years of the 16th century. In a case of forgery in 1579 two\r\nwitnesses, a clergyman and an attorney, were so tortured. In a letter\r\ndated 1583 at the Record Office in London, Walsingham instructs the\r\nEnglish ambassador at Edinburgh to have Father Holt, an English Jesuit,\r\n\"put to the boots.\" It seems to have fallen into disuse after 1630, but\r\nwas revived in 1666 on the occasion of the Covenanters' rebellion, and\r\nwas employed during the reigns of Charles II. and James II. Upon the\r\naccession of William III. the Scottish convention denounced \"the use of\r\ntorture, without evidence and in ordinary crimes, as contrary to law.\"\r\nHowever, a year or so later, one Neville Payne, an Englishman suspected\r\nof treasonable motives for visiting Scotland, was put to the torture\r\nunder the authority of a warrant signed by the king. This is the last\r\nrecorded case of its use, torture being finally abolished in Scotland in\r\n1709. It was not used in England after 1640. The boot was made of iron\r\nor wood and iron fastened on the leg, between which and the boot wedges\r\nwere driven by blows from a mallet. After each blow a question was put\r\nto the victim, and the ordeal was continued until he gave the\r\ninformation or fainted. The wedges were usually placed against the calf\r\nof the leg, but Bishop Burnet says that they were sometimes put against\r\nthe shin-bone. A similar instrument, called \"Spanish boots,\" was used in\r\nGermany. There were also iron boots which were heated on the victim's\r\nfoot. A less cruel form was a boot or buskin made wet and drawn upon the\r\nlegs and then dried with fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOTES (Gr. [Greek: bootaes], a ploughman, from [Greek: bous], an ox), a\r\nconstellation of the northern hemisphere, mentioned by Eudoxus (4th\r\ncentury B.C.) and Aratus (3rd century B.C.), and perhaps alluded to in\r\nthe book of Job (see ARCTURUS), and by Homer and Hesiod. The ancient\r\nGreeks symbolized it as a man walking, with his right hand grasping a\r\nclub, and his left extending upwards and holding the leash of two dogs,\r\nwhich are apparently barking at the Great Bear. Ptolemy catalogues\r\ntwenty-three stars, Tycho Brahe twenty-eight, Hevelius fifty-two. In\r\naddition to Arcturus, the brightest in the group, the most interesting\r\nstars of this constellation are: _[epsilon] Bootis_, a beautiful double\r\nstar composed of a yellow star of magnitude 3, and a blue star of\r\nmagnitude 6-1/2; _[xi] Bootis_, a double star composed of a yellow star,\r\nmagnitude 4-1/2, and a purple star, magnitude 6-1/2; and _W. Bootis_, an\r\nirregularly variable star. This constellation has been known by many\r\nother names--Arcas, Arctophylax, Arcturus minor, Bubuleus, Bubulus,\r\nCanis latrans, Clamator, Icarus, Lycaon, Philometus, Plaustri custos,\r\nPlorans, Thegnis, Vociferator; the Arabs termed it Aramech or Archamech;\r\nHesychius named it Orion; Jules Schiller, St Sylvester; Schickard,\r\nNimrod; and Weigelius, the Three Swedish Crowns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOTH, BARTON (1681-1733), English actor, who came of a good Lancashire\r\nfamily, was educated at Westminster school, where his success in the\r\nLatin play _Andria_ gave him an inclination for the stage. He was\r\nintended for the church; but in 1698 he ran away from Trinity College,\r\nCambridge, and obtained employment in a theatrical company in Dublin,\r\nwhere he made his first appearance as Oroonoko. After two seasons in\r\nIreland he returned to London, where Betterton, who on an earlier\r\napplication had withheld his active aid, probably out of regard for\r\nBooth's family, now gave him all the assistance in his power. At\r\nLincoln's Inn Fields (1700-1704) he first appeared as Maximus in\r\n_Valentinian_, and his success was immediate. He was at the Haymarket\r\nwith Betterton from 1705 to 1708, and for the next twenty years at Drury\r\nLane. Booth died on the 10th of May 1733, and was buried in Westminster\r\nAbbey. His greatest parts, after the title-part of Addison's _Cato_,\r\nwhich established his reputation as a tragedian, were probably Hotspur\r\nand Brutus. His Lear was deemed worthy of comparison with Garrick's. As\r\nthe ghost in _Hamlet_ he is said never to have had a superior. Among his\r\nother Shakespearian roles were Mark Antony, Timon of Athens and Othello.\r\nHe also played to perfection the gay Lothario in Rowe's _Fair Penitent_.\r\nBooth was twice married; his second wife, Hester Santlow, an actress of\r\nsome merit, survived him.\r\n\r\n  See Cibber, _Lives and Characters of the most eminent Actors and\r\n  Actresses_ (1753); Victor, _Memoirs of the Life of Barton Booth_\r\n  (1733).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOTH, CHARLES (1840-   ), English sociologist, was born at Liverpool on\r\nthe 30th of March 1840. In 1862 he became a partner in Alfred Booth &\r\nCompany, a Liverpool firm engaged in the Brazil trade, and subsequently\r\nchairman of the Booth Steamship Company. He devoted much time, and no\r\ninconsiderable sums of money, to inquiries into the statistical aspects\r\nof social questions. The results of these are chiefly embodied in a work\r\nentitled _Life and Labour of the People in London_ (1891-1903), of which\r\nthe earlier portion appeared under the title of _Life and Labour_ in\r\n1889. The book is designed to show \"the numerical relation which\r\npoverty, misery and depravity bear to regular earnings and comparative\r\ncomfort, and to describe the general conditions under which each class\r\nlives.\" It contains a most striking series of maps, in which the varying\r\ndegrees of poverty are represented street by street, by shades of\r\ncolour. The data for the work were derived in part from the detailed\r\nrecords kept by school-board \"visitors,\" partly from systematic\r\ninquiries directed by Mr Booth himself, supplemented by information\r\nderived from relieving officers and the Charity Organization Society. Mr\r\nBooth also paid much attention to a kindred subject--the lot of the aged\r\npoor. In 1894 he published a volume of statistics on the subject, and,\r\nin 1891 and 1899, works on Old-age pensions, his scheme for the latter\r\ndepending on a general provision of pensions of five shillings a week to\r\nall aged persons, irrespective of the cost to the state. He married, in\r\n1871, the daughter of Charles Zachary Macaulay. In 1904 he was made a\r\nprivy councillor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOTH, EDWIN [THOMAS] (1833-1893), American actor, was the second son of\r\nthe actor Junius Brutus Booth, and was born in Belair, Maryland, on the\r\n13th of November 1833. His father (1796-1852) was born in London on the\r\n1st of May 1796, and, after trying printing, law, painting and the sea,\r\nmade his first appearance on the stage in 1813, and appeared in London\r\nat Covent Garden in 1815. He became almost at once a great favourite,\r\nand a rival of Kean, whom he was thought to resemble. To Kean's Othello\r\nnevertheless he played Iago on several occasions. Richard III., Hamlet,\r\nKing Lear, Shylock and Sir Giles Overreach were his best parts, and in\r\nAmerica, whither he removed in 1821, they brought him great popularity.\r\nHis eccentricities sometimes bordered on insanity, and his excited and\r\nfurious fencing as Richard III. and as Hamlet frequently compelled the\r\nRichmond and Laertes to fight for their lives in deadly earnest.\r\n\r\nEdwin Booth's first regular appearance was at the Boston Museum on the\r\n10th of September 1849, as Tressel to his father's Richard, in Colley\r\nCibber's version of _Richard III._ He was lithe and graceful in figure,\r\nbuoyant in spirits; his dark hair fell in waving curls across his brow,\r\nand his eyes were soft, luminous and most expressive. His father watched\r\nhim with great interest, but with evident disappointment, and the\r\nmembers of the theatrical profession, who held the acting of the elder\r\nBooth in great reverence, seemed to agree that the genius of the father\r\nhad not descended to the son. Edwin Booth's first appearance in New York\r\nwas in the character of Wilford in _The Iron Chest_, which he played at\r\nthe National theatre in Chatham Street, on the 27th of September 1850. A\r\nyear later, on the illness of the father, the son took his place in the\r\ncharacter of Richard III. It was not until after his parent's death that\r\nthe son conquered for himself an unassailable position on the stage.\r\nBetween 1852 and 1856 he played in California, Australia and the\r\nSandwich Islands, and those who had known him in the east were surprised\r\nwhen the news came that he had captivated his audiences with his\r\nbrilliant acting. From this time forward his dramatic triumphs were\r\nwarmly acknowledged. His Hamlet, Richard and Richelieu were pronounced\r\nto be superior to the performances of Edwin Forrest; his success as Sir\r\nGiles Overreach in _A New Way to Pay Old Debts_ surpassed his father's.\r\nIn 1862 he became manager of the Winter Garden theatre, New York, where\r\nhe gave a series of Shakespearian productions of then unexampled\r\nmagnificence (1864-1867), including _Hamlet_, _Othello_ and _The\r\nMerchant of Venice_. The splendour of this period in his career was\r\ndashed for many months when in 1865 his brother, John Wilkes Booth,\r\nassassinated President Lincoln (see LINCOLN, ABRAHAM). The three Booth\r\nbrothers, Junius Brutus (1821-1853), Edwin and John Wilkes (1839-1865),\r\nhad played together in _Julius Caesar_ in the autumn of the previous\r\nyear--the performance being memorable both for its own excellence, and\r\nfor the tragic situation into which two of the principal performers were\r\nsubsequently hurled by the crime of the third. Edwin Booth did not\r\nreappear on the stage until the 3rd of January 1866, when he played\r\nHamlet at the Winter Garden theatre, the audience showing by unstinted\r\napplause their conviction that the glory of the one brother would never\r\nbe imperilled by the infamy of the other.\r\n\r\nIn 1868-1869 Edwin Booth built a theatre of his own--Booth's theatre, at\r\nthe corner of 23rd Street and 6th Avenue, New York--and organized an\r\nexcellent stock company, which produced _Romeo and Juliet_, _The\r\nWinter's Tale_, _Julius Caesar_, _Macbeth_, _Much Ado about Nothing_,\r\n_The Merchant of Venice_ and other plays. In all cases Booth used the\r\ntrue text of Shakespeare, thus antedating by many years a similar reform\r\nin England. Almost invariably his ventures were successful, but he was\r\nof a generous and confiding nature, and his management was not\r\neconomical. In 1874 the grand dramatic structure he had raised was taken\r\nfrom him, and with it went his entire fortune. By arduous toil,\r\nhowever, he again accumulated wealth, in the use of which his generous\r\nnature was shown. He converted his spacious residence in Gramercy Park,\r\nNew York, into a club--The Players'--for the elect of his profession,\r\nand for such members of other professions as they might choose. The\r\nhouse, with all his books and works of art, and many invaluable mementos\r\nof the stage, became the property of the club. A single apartment he\r\nkept for himself. In this he died on the 7th of June 1893. Among his\r\nparts were Macbeth, Lear, Othello, Iago, Shylock, Wolsey, Richard II.,\r\nRichard III., Benedick, Petruccio, Richelieu, Sir Giles Overreach,\r\nBrutus (Payne's), Bertuccio (in Tom Taylor's _The Fool's Revenge_), Ruy\r\nBlas, Don Cesar de Bazan, and many more. His most famous part was\r\nHamlet, for which his extraordinary grace and beauty and his eloquent\r\nsensibility peculiarly fitted him. He probably played the part oftener\r\nthan any other actor before or since. He visited London in 1851, and\r\nagain in 1880 and in 1882, playing at the Haymarket theatre with\r\nbrilliant success. In the last year he also visited Germany, where his\r\nacting was received with the highest enthusiasm. His last appearance was\r\nin Brooklyn as Hamlet in 1891. Booth was twice married: in 1860 to Mary\r\nDevlin (d. 1863), and in 1869 to Mary F. McVicker (d. 1881). He left by\r\nhis first wife one daughter, Edwina Booth Grossman, who published _Edwin\r\nBooth: Recollections_ (New York, 1894).\r\n\r\n  Edwin Booth's prompt-books were edited by William Winter (1878). In a\r\n  series of volumes, _Actors and Actresses of Great Britain and\r\n  America_, edited by Lawrence Hutton and Brander Matthews, Edwin Booth\r\n  contributed recollections of his father, which contain much valuable\r\n  autobiographic material. For the same series Lawrence Barrett\r\n  contributed an article on Edwin Booth. See also William Winter, _Life\r\n  and Art of Edwin Booth_ (1893); Lawrence Hutton, _Edwin Booth_ (1893);\r\n  Henry A. Clapp, _Reminiscences of a Dramatic Critic_ (Boston, 1902);\r\n  A.B. Clarke. _The Elder and the Younger Booth_ (Boston, 1882).\r\n       (J. J.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOTH, WILLIAM (1829-   ), founder and \"general\" of the Salvation Army\r\n(q.v.), was born at Nottingham on the 10th of April 1829. At the age\r\nof fifteen his mind took a strongly religious turn, under the influence\r\nof the Wesleyan Methodists, in which body he became a local preacher. In\r\n1849 he came to London, where, according to his own account, his passion\r\nfor open-air preaching caused his severance from the Wesleyans. Joining\r\nthe Methodist New Connexion, he was ordained a minister, but, not being\r\nemployed as he wished in active \"travelling evangelization,\" left that\r\nbody also in 1861. Meanwhile he had (1855) married Miss Catherine\r\nMumford, and had a family of four children. Both he and his wife\r\noccupied themselves with preaching, first in Cornwall and then in\r\nCardiff and Walsall. At the last-named place was first organized a\r\n\"Hallelujah band\" of converted criminals and others, who testified in\r\npublic of their conversion. In 1864 Booth went to London and continued\r\nhis services in tents and in the open air, and founded a body which was\r\nsuccessively known as the East London Revival Society, the East London\r\nChristian Mission, the Christian Mission and (in 1878) the Salvation\r\nArmy. The Army operates (1) by outdoor meetings and processions; (2) by\r\nvisiting public-houses, prisons, private houses; (3) by holding meetings\r\nin theatres, factories and other unusual buildings; (4) by using the\r\nmost popular song-tunes and the language of everyday life, &c.; (5) by\r\nmaking every convert a daily witness for Christ, both in public and\r\nprivate. The army is a quasi-military organization, and Booth modelled\r\nits \"Orders and Regulations\" on those of the British army. Its early\r\n\"campaigns\" excited violent opposition, a \"Skeleton Army\" being\r\norganized to break up the meetings, and for many years Booth's followers\r\nwere subjected to fine and imprisonment as breakers of the peace. Since\r\n1889, however, these disorders have been little heard of. The operations\r\nof the army were extended in 1880 to the United States, in 1881 to\r\nAustralia, and spread to the European continent, to India, Ceylon and\r\nelsewhere, \"General\" Booth himself being an indefatigable traveller,\r\norganizer and speaker. His wife (b. 1829) died in 1890. By her preaching\r\nat Gateshead, where her husband was circuit minister, in 1860, she began\r\nthe women's ministry which is so prominent a feature of the army's work.\r\nA biography of her by Mr Booth Tucker appeared in 1892.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 \"General\" Booth attracted further public attention by the\r\npublication of a work entitled _In Darkest England, and the Way Out_, in\r\nwhich he proposed to remedy pauperism and vice by a series of ten\r\nexpedients: (1) the city colony; (2) the farm colony; (3) the over-sea\r\ncolony; (4) the household salvage brigade; (5) the rescue homes for\r\nfallen women; (6) deliverance for the drunkard; (7) the prison-gate\r\nbrigade; (8) the poor man's bank; (9) the poor man's lawyer; (10)\r\nWhitechapel-by-the-Sea. Money was liberally subscribed and a large part\r\nof the scheme was carried out. The opposition and ridicule with which\r\nBooth's work was for many years received gave way, towards the end of\r\nthe 19th century, to very widespread sympathy as his genius and its\r\nresults were more fully realized.\r\n\r\nThe active encouragement of King Edward VII., at whose instance in 1902\r\nhe was invited officially to be present at the coronation ceremony,\r\nmarked the completeness of the change; and when, in 1905, the \"general\"\r\nwent on a progress through England, he was received in state by the\r\nmayors and corporations of many towns. In the United States also, and\r\nelsewhere, his work was cordially encouraged by the authorities.\r\n\r\n  See T.F. Coates, _The Life Story of General Booth_ (2nd ed., London,\r\n  1906), and bibliography under SALVATION ARMY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOTH (connected with a Teutonic root meaning to dwell, whence also\r\n\"bower\"), primarily a temporary dwelling of boughs or other slight\r\nmaterials. Later the word gained the special meaning of a market stall\r\nor any non-permanent erection, such as a tent at a fair, where goods\r\nwere on sale. Later still it was applied to the temporary structure\r\nwhere votes were registered, viz. polling-booth. Temporary booths\r\nerected for the weekly markets naturally tended to become permanent\r\nshops. Thus Stow states that the houses in Old Fish Street, London,\r\n\"were at first but movable boards set out on market days to show their\r\nfish there to be sold; but procuring licence to set up sheds, they grew\r\nto shops, and by little and little, to tall houses.\" As _bothy_ or\r\n_bothie_, in Scotland, meaning generally a hut or cottage, the word was\r\nspecially applied to a barrack-like room on large farms where the\r\nunmarried labourers were lodged. This, known as the _Bothy system_, was\r\nformerly common in Aberdeenshire and other parts of northern Scotland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOTHIA (_Boothia Felix_), a peninsula of British North America,\r\nbelonging to Franklin district, and having an area of 13,100 sq. m.,\r\nbetween 69 deg. 30' and 71 deg. 50' N. and 91 deg. 30' and 97 deg. W.\r\nIts northernmost promontory, Murchison Point, is also the northernmost\r\npoint of the American mainland. It was discovered by Captain (afterwards\r\nSir James) Ross, during his expedition of 1829-1833, and was named after\r\nSir Felix Booth, who had been chiefly instrumental in fitting out the\r\nexpedition. Boothia forms the western side of Boothia Gulf. From the\r\nmain mass of the continent the peninsula is almost separated by lakes\r\nand inlets; and a narrow channel known as Bellot Strait intervenes\r\nbetween it and North Somerset Island, which was discovered by Sir E.\r\nParry in 1819. The peninsula is not only interesting for its connexion\r\nwith the Franklin expedition and the Franklin search, but is of\r\nscientific importance from the north magnetic pole having been first\r\ndistinctly localized here by Ross, on the western side, in 70 deg. 5'\r\nN., 96 deg. 47' W.\r\n\r\nBoothia Gulf separates the north-western portion of Baffin Land and\r\nMelville Peninsula from Boothia Peninsula. It is connected with Barrow\r\nStrait and Lancaster Sound by Prince Regent Inlet, with Franklin Strait\r\nby Bellot Strait, and with Fox Channel by Fury and Hecla Strait. The\r\nprincipal bays are Committee and Pelly in the southern portion, and Lord\r\nMayor in the western.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOTLE, a municipal and county borough in the Bootle parliamentary\r\ndivision of Lancashire, England; at the mouth of the Mersey, forming a\r\nnorthern suburb of Liverpool. Pop. (1901) 58,566; an increase by nearly\r\nnine times in forty years. The great docks on this, the east bank of the\r\nMersey, extend into the borough, but are considered as a whole under\r\nLIVERPOOL (q.v.). Such features, moreover, as communications,\r\nwater-supply, &c., may be considered as part of the greater systems of\r\nthe same city. The chief buildings and institutions are a handsome town\r\nhall, a museum, free libraries, technical schools, and several public\r\npleasure grounds. Bootle was incorporated in 1868 and was created a\r\ncounty borough in 1888; the corporation consists of a mayor, 10 aldermen\r\nand 30 councillors. A proposal to include it within the city of\r\nLiverpool was rejected in parliament in July 1903. Area, 1576 acres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOTY (apparently influenced by \"boot,\" 0. Eng. _bot_, advantage or\r\nprofit, through an adaptation from an earlier form cognate with Ger.\r\n_Beute_ and Fr. _butin_), plunder or gain. The phrase \"to play booty,\"\r\ndating from the 16th century, means to play into a confederate's hands,\r\nor to play intentionally badly at first in order to deceive an opponent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOPP, FRANZ (1791-1867), German philologist, was born at Mainz on the\r\n14th of September 1791. In consequence of the political troubles of that\r\ntime, his parents removed to Aschaffenburg, in Bavaria, where he\r\nreceived a liberal education at the Lyceum. It was here that his\r\nattention was drawn to the languages and literature of the East by the\r\neloquent lectures of Karl J. Windischmann, who, with G.F. Creuzer, J.J.\r\nGorres, and the brothers Schlegel, was full of enthusiasm for Indian\r\nwisdom and philosophy. And further, Fr. Schlegel's book, _Uber die\r\nSprache und Weisheit der Indier_ (Heidelberg, 1808), which was just then\r\nexerting a powerful influence on the minds of German philosophers and\r\nhistorians, could not fail to stimulate also Bopp's interest in the\r\nsacred language of the Hindus. In 1812 he went to Paris at the expense\r\nof the Bavarian government, with a view to devote himself vigorously to\r\nthe study of Sanskrit. There he enjoyed the society of such eminent men\r\nas A.L. Chezy, S. de Sacy, L.M. Langles, and, above all, of Alexander\r\nHamilton (1762-1824), who had acquired, when in India, an acquaintance\r\nwith Sanskrit, and had brought out, conjointly with Langles, a\r\ndescriptive catalogue of the Sanskrit manuscripts of the Imperial\r\nlibrary. At that library Bopp had access not only to the rich collection\r\nof Sanskrit manuscripts, most of which had been brought from India by\r\nFather Pons early in the 18th century, but also to the Sanskrit books\r\nwhich had up to that time issued from the Calcutta and Serampore\r\npresses. The first fruit of his four years' study in Paris appeared at\r\nFrankfort-On-Main in 1816, under the title _Uber das Conjugationssystem\r\nder Sanskritsprache in Vergleichung mit jenem der griechischen,\r\nlateinischen, persischen und germanischen Sprache_, and it was\r\naccompanied with a preface from the pen of Windischmann. In this first\r\nbook Bopp entered at once on the path on which the philological\r\nresearches of his whole subsequent life were concentrated. It was not\r\nthat he wished to prove the common parentage of Sanskrit with Persian,\r\nGreek, Latin and German, for that had long been established; but his\r\nobject was to trace the common origin of their grammatical forms, of\r\ntheir inflections from composition,--a task which had never been\r\nattempted. By a historical analysis of those forms, as applied to the\r\nverb, he furnished the first trustworthy materials for a history of the\r\nlanguages compared.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief sojourn in Germany, Bopp came to London, where he made the\r\nacquaintance of Sir Charles Wilkins and H.T. Colebrooke, and became the\r\nfriend of Wilhelm von Humboldt, then Prussian ambassador at the court of\r\nSt James's, to whom he gave instruction in Sanskrit. He brought out, in\r\nthe _Annals of Oriental Literature_ (London, 1820), an essay entitled,\r\n\"Analytical Comparison of the Sanskrit, Greek, Latin and Teutonic\r\nLanguages,\" in which he extended to all parts of the grammar what he had\r\ndone in his first book for the verb alone. He had previously published a\r\ncritical edition, with a Latin translation and notes, of the story of\r\n_Nala and Damayanti_ (London, 1819), the most beautiful episode of the\r\nMahabharata. Other episodes of the Mahabharata--_Indralokagamanam_,\r\nand three others (Berlin, 1824); _Diluvium_, and three others (Berlin,\r\n1829); and a new edition of _Nala_ (Berlin, 1832)--followed in due\r\ncourse, all of which, with A.W. Schlegel's edition of the _Bhagavadgita_\r\n(1823), proved excellent aids in initiating the early student into the\r\nreading of Sanskrit texts. On the publication, in Calcutta, of the whole\r\nMahabharata, Bopp discontinued editing Sanskrit texts, and confined\r\nhimself thenceforth exclusively to grammatical investigations.\r\n\r\nAfter a short residence at Gottingen, Bopp was, on the recommendation of\r\nHumboldt, appointed to the chair of Sanskrit and comparative grammar at\r\nBerlin in 1821, and was elected member of the Royal Prussian Academy in\r\nthe following year. He brought out, in 1827, his _Ausfuhrliches\r\nLehrgebaude der Sanskrita-Sprache_, on which he had been engaged since\r\n1821. A new edition, in Latin, was commenced in the following year, and\r\ncompleted in 1832; and a shorter grammar appeared in 1834. At the same\r\ntime he compiled a Sanskrit and Latin glossary (1830) in which, more\r\nespecially in the second and third editions (1847 and 1867), account was\r\nalso taken of the cognate languages. His chief activity, however,\r\ncentred on the elaboration of his _Comparative Grammar_, which appeared\r\nin six parts at considerable intervals (Berlin, 1833, 1835, 1842, 1847,\r\n1849, 1852), under the title _Vergleichende Grammatik des Sanskrit,\r\nZend, Griechischen, Lateinischen, Litthauischen, Altslavischen,\r\nGothischen, und Deutschen_. How carefully this work was matured may be\r\ngathered from the series of monographs printed in the _Transactions of\r\nthe Berlin Academy_ (1824 to 1831), by which it was preceded. They bear\r\nthe general title, _Vergleichende Zergliederung des Sanskrits und der\r\nmit ihm verwandten Sprachen_. Two other essays (on the \"Numerals,\" 1835)\r\nfollowed the publication of the first part of the _Comparative Grammar_.\r\nThe Old-Slavonian began to take its stand among the languages compared\r\nfrom the second part onwards. The work was translated into English by\r\nE.B. Eastwick in 1845. A second German edition, thoroughly revised\r\n(1856-1861), comprised also the Old-Armenian. From this edition an\r\nexcellent French translation was made by Professor Michel Breal in 1866.\r\nThe task which Bopp endeavoured to carry out in his _Comparative\r\nGrammar_ was threefold,--to give a description of the original\r\ngrammatical structure of the languages as deduced from their\r\nintercomparison, to trace their phonetic laws, and to investigate the\r\norigin of their grammatical forms. The first and second points were\r\nsubservient to the third. As Bopp's researches were based on the best\r\navailable sources, and incorporated every new item of information that\r\ncame to light, so they continued to widen and deepen in their progress.\r\nWitness his monographs on the vowel system in the Teutonic languages\r\n(1836), on the Celtic languages (1839), on the Old-Prussian (1853) and\r\nAlbanian languages (1854), on the accent in Sanskrit and Greek (1854),\r\non the relationship of the Malayo-Polynesian with the Indo-European\r\nlanguages (1840), and on the Caucasian languages (1846). In the two last\r\nmentioned the impetus of his genius led him on a wrong track. Bopp has\r\nbeen charged with neglecting the study of the native Sanskrit grammars,\r\nbut in those early days of Sanskrit studies the requisite materials were\r\nnot accessible in the great libraries of Europe; and if they had been,\r\nthey would have absorbed his exclusive attention for years, while such\r\ngrammars as those of Wilkins and Colebrooke, from which his grammatical\r\nknowledge was derived, were all based on native grammars. The further\r\ncharge that Bopp, in his _Comparative Grammar_, gave undue prominence to\r\nSanskrit may be disproved by his own words; for, as early as the year\r\n1820, he gave it as his opinion that frequently the cognate languages\r\nserve to elucidate grammatical forms lost in Sanskrit (_Annals of Or.\r\nLit._ i. 3),--an opinion which he further developed in all his\r\nsubsequent writings.\r\n\r\nBopp's researches, carried with wonderful penetration into the most\r\nminute and almost microscopical details of linguistic phenomena, have\r\nled to the opening up of a wide and distant view into the original\r\nseats, the closer or more distant affinity, and the tenets, practices\r\nand domestic usages of the ancient Indo-European nations, and the\r\nscience of comparative grammar may truly be said to date from his\r\nearliest publication. In grateful recognition of that fact, on the\r\nfiftieth anniversary (May 16, 1866) of the date of Windischmann's\r\npreface to that work, a fund called _Die Bopp-Stiftung_, for the\r\npromotion of the study of Sanskrit and comparative grammar, was\r\nestablished at Berlin, to which liberal contributions were made by his\r\nnumerous pupils and admirers in all parts of the globe. Bopp lived to\r\nsee the results of his labours everywhere accepted, and his name justly\r\ncelebrated. But he died, on the 23rd of October 1867, a poor\r\nman,--though his genuine kindliness and unselfishness, his devotion to\r\nhis family and friends, and his rare modesty, endeared him to all who\r\nknew him.\r\n\r\n  See M. Breal's translation of Bopp's _Vergl. Gramm._ (1866)\r\n  introduction; Th.

S. of Coblenz on the mainline to Cologne. Pop.\r\n(1900) 5806. It is an old town still partly surrounded by medieval\r\nwalls, and its most noteworthy buildings are the Roman Catholic parish\r\nchurch (12th and 13th centuries); the Carmelite church (1318), the\r\nformer castle, now used for administrative offices; the Evangelical\r\nchurch (1851, enlarged in 1887); and the former Benedictine motnastery\r\nof the Marienberg, founded 1123 and since 1839 a hydropathic\r\nestablishment, crowning a hill 100 ft. above the Rhine. Boppard is a\r\nfavourite tourist centre, and being less pent in by hills than many\r\nother places in this part of the picturesque gorge of the Rhine, has in\r\nmodern times become a residential town. It has some comparatively\r\ninsignificant industries, such as tanning and tobacco manufacture; its\r\ndirect trade is in wine and fruit.\r\n\r\nBoppard (_Baudobriga_) was founded by the Romans; under the Merovingian\r\ndynasty it became a royal residence. During the middle ages it was a\r\nconsiderable centre of commerce and shipping, and under the Hohenstaufen\r\nemperors was raised to the rank of a free imperial city. In 1312,\r\nhowever, the emperor Henry VII. pledged the town to his brother Baldwin,\r\narchbishop-elector of Trier, and it remained in the possession of the\r\nelectors until it was absorbed by France during the Revolutionary epoch.\r\nIt was assigned by the congress of Vienna in 1815 to Prussia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORA, an Italian name for a violent cold northerly and northeasterly\r\nwind, common in the Adriatic, especially on the Istrian and Dalmatian\r\ncoasts. There is always a northern tendency in the winds on the north\r\nMediterranean shores in winter owing to the cold air of the mountains\r\nsliding down to the sea where the pressure is less. When, therefore, a\r\ncyclone is formed over the Mediterranean, the currents in its\r\nnorth-western area draw the air from the cold northern regions, and\r\nduring the passage of the cyclone the bora prevails. The bora also\r\noccurs at Novorossiysk on the Black Sea. It is precisely similar in\r\ncharacter to the mistral which prevails in Provence and along the French\r\nMediterranean littoral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORACITE, a mineral of special interest on account of its optical\r\nanomalies. Small crystals bounded on all sides by sharply defined faces\r\nare found in considerable numbers embedded in gypsum and anhydrite in\r\nthe salt deposits at Luneburg in Hanover, where it was first observed in\r\n1787. In external form these crystals are cubic with inclined\r\nhemihedrism, the symmetry being the same as in blende and tetrahedrite.\r\nTheir habit varies according to whether the tetrahedron (fig. 1), the\r\ncube (fig. 2). or the rhombic dodecahedron (fig. 3) predominates.\r\nPenetration twins with a tetrahedron face as twin-plane are sometimes\r\nobserved. The crystals vary from translucent to transparent, are\r\npossessed of a vitreous lustre, and are colourless or white, though\r\noften tinged with grey, yellow or green. The hardness is as high as 7 on\r\nMohs' scale; specific gravity 3.0. As first observed by R.J. Hauy in\r\n1791, the crystals are markedly pyroelectric; a cube when heated becomes\r\npositively electrified on four of its corners and negatively on the four\r\nopposite corners. In a crystal such as represented in fig. 3, the\r\nsmaller and dull tetrahedral faces s are situated at the analogous poles\r\n(which become positively electrified when the crystal is heated), and\r\nthe larger and bright tetrahedral faces _s'_ at the antilogous poles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Fig. 3\r\n\r\nCrystals of Boracite]\r\n\r\nThe characters so far enumerated are strictly in accordance with cubic\r\nsymmetry, but when a crystal is examined in polarized light, it will be\r\nseen to be doubly refracting, as was first observed by Sir David\r\nBrewster in 1821. Thin sections show twin-lamellae, and a division into\r\ndefinite areas which are optically biaxial. By cutting sections in\r\nsuitable directions, it may be proved that a rhombic dodecahedral\r\ncrystal is really built up of twelve orthorhombic pyramids, the apices\r\nof which meet in the centre and the bases coincide with the dodecahedral\r\nfaces of the compound (pseudo-cubic) crystal. Crystals of other forms\r\nshow other types of internal structure. When the crystals are heated\r\nthese optical characters change, and at a temperature of 265 deg. the\r\ncrystals suddenly become optically isotropic; on cooling, however, the\r\ncomplexity of internal structure reappears. Various explanations have\r\nbeen offered to account for these \"optical anomalies\" of boracite. Some\r\nobservers have attributed them to alteration, others to internal strains\r\nin the crystals, which originally grew as truly cubic at a temperature\r\nabove 265 deg. It would, however, appear that there are really two\r\ncrystalline modifications of the boracite substance, a cubic\r\nmodification stable above 265 deg. and an orthorhombic (or monoclinic)\r\none stable at a lower temperature. This is strictly analogous to the\r\ncase of silver iodide, of which cubic and rhombohedral modifications\r\nexist at different temperatures; but whereas rhombohedral as well as\r\npseudo-cubic crystals of silver iodide (iodyrite) are known in nature,\r\nonly pseudo-cubic crystals of boracite have as yet been met with.\r\n\r\nChemically, boracite is a magnesium borate and chloride with the formula\r\nMg7Cl2B16O30--A small amount of iron is sometimes present, and an\r\niron-boracite with half the magnesium replaced by ferrous iron has been\r\ncalled huyssenite. The mineral is insoluble in water, but soluble in\r\nhydrochloric acid. On exposure it is liable to slow alteration, owing to\r\nthe absorption of water by the magnesium chloride: an altered form is\r\nknown as parasite.\r\n\r\nIn addition to embedded crystals, a massive variety, known as\r\nstassfurtite, occurs as nodules in the salt deposits at Stassfurt in\r\nPrussia: that from the carnallite layer is compact, resembling\r\nfine-grained marble, and white or greenish in colour, whilst that from\r\nthe kainite layer is soft and earthy, and yellowish or reddish in\r\ncolour.     (L. J. S.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORAGE (pronounced like \"courage\"; possibly from Lat. _borra_, rough\r\nhair), a herb (_Borago officinalis_) with bright blue flowers and hairy\r\nleaves and stem, considered to have some virtue as a cordial and a\r\nfebrifuge; used as an ingredient in salads or in making claret-cup, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORAGINACEAE, an order of plants belonging to the sympetalous section of\r\ndicotyledons, and a member of the series Tubiflorae. It is represented\r\nin Britain by bugloss (_Echium_) (fig. 1), comfrey (_Symphytum_),\r\n_Myosotis_, hounds-tongue (_Cynoglossum_) (fig. 2), and other genera,\r\nwhile borage (_Borago officinalis_) (fig. 3) occurs as a garden escape\r\nin waste ground. The plants are rough-haired annual or perennial herbs,\r\nmore rarely shrubby or arborescent, as in _Cordia_ and _Ehretia_, which\r\nare tropical or sub-tropical. The leaves, which are generally alternate,\r\nare usually entire and narrow: the radical leaves in some genera, as\r\n_Pulmonaria_ (lungwort) and _Cynoglossum_, differ in form from the\r\nstem-leaves, being generally broader and sometimes heart-shaped. A\r\ncharacteristic feature is the one-sided (_dorsiventral_) inflorescence,\r\nwell illustrated in forget-me-not and other species of _Myosotis_; the\r\ncyme is at first closely coiled, becoming uncoiled as the flowers open.\r\nAt the same time there is often a change in colour in the flowers, which\r\nare red in bud, becoming blue as they expand, as in _Myosotis, Echium,\r\nSymphytum_ and others. The flowers are generally regular; the form of\r\nthe corolla varies widely. Thus in borage it is rotate, tubular in\r\ncomfrey, funnel-shaped in hounds-tongue, and salver-shaped in alkanet\r\n(_Anchusa_); the throat is often closed by scale-like outgrowths from\r\nthe corolla, forming the so-called corona. A departure from the usual\r\nregular corolla occurs in _Echium_ and a few allied genera, where it is\r\noblique; in _Lycopsis_ it is also bent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Viper's Bugloss (_Echium vulgare_), about 1/4\r\nnat. size.\r\n\r\n  1.

One stamen.\r\n\r\nThe five stamens alternate in position with the lobes of the corolla.\r\nThe ovary, of two carpels, is seated on a ring-like disk which secretes\r\nhoney. Each carpel becomes divided by a median constriction in four\r\nportions, each containing one ovule; the style springs from the centre\r\nof the group of four divisions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--(1) Inflorescence of Forget-me-not; (2) ripe\r\nfruits.]\r\n\r\nThe flowers show well-marked adaptation to insect-visits. Their colour\r\nand tendency to arrangement on one surface, with the presence of honey,\r\nserve to attract insects. The scales around the throat of the corolla\r\nprotect the pollen and honey from wet or undesirable visitors, and by\r\ntheir difference in colour from the corolla-lobes, as in the yellow eye\r\nof forget-me-not, may serve to indicate the position of the honey. In\r\nmost genera the fruit consists of one-seeded nutlets, generally four,\r\nbut one or more may be undeveloped. The shape of the nutlet and the\r\ncharacter of its coat are very varied. Thus in _Lithospermum_ the\r\nnutlets are hard like a stone, in _Myosotis_ usually polished, in\r\n_Cynoglossum_ covered with bristles, &c.\r\n\r\nThe order is widely spread in temperate and tropical regions, and\r\ncontains 85 genera with about 1200 species. Its chief centre is the\r\nMediterranean region, whence it extends over central Europe and Asia,\r\nbecoming less frequent northwards. A smaller centre occurs on the\r\nPacific side of North America. The order is less developed in the south\r\ntemperate zone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--(1) Flower of Borage; (2) same in vertical\r\nsection enlarged; (3) horizontal plan of flower; (4) flower of Comfrey\r\nafter removal of corolla, showing unripe fruit.]\r\n\r\nThe order is of little economic value. Several genera, such as borage\r\nand _Pulmonaria_, were formerly used in medicine, and the roots yield\r\npurple or brown dyes, as in _Alkanna tinctoria_ (alkanet). Heliotrope or\r\ncherry-pie (_Heliotropium peruvianum_) is a well-known garden plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORAS, a town of Sweden, in the district (_lan_) of Elfsborg, 45 m. E.\r\nof Gothenburg by rail, on the river Viske. Pop. (1880) 4723; (1900)\r\n15,837. It ranks among the first twelve towns in Sweden both in\r\npopulation and in the value of its manufacturing industries. These are\r\nprincipally textile, as there are numerous cotton spinning and weaving\r\nmills, together with a technical weaving school. The town was founded in\r\n1632 by King Gustavus Adolphus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORAX (sodium pyroborate or sodium biborate), Na2B4O7, a substance which\r\nappears in commerce under two forms, namely \"common\" or prismatic borax,\r\nNa_2B4O7.10H2O, and \"jewellers'\" or octahedral borax, Na_2B4O7.5H2O. It\r\nis to be noted that the term \"borax\" was used by the alchemists in a\r\nvery vague manner, and is therefore not to be taken as meaning the\r\nsubstance now specifically known by the name. Prismatic borax is found\r\nwidely distributed as a natural product (see below, _Mineralogy_) in\r\nTibet, and in Canada, Peru and Transylvania, while the bed of Borax\r\nLake, near Clear Lake in California, is occupied by a large mass of\r\ncrystallized borax, which is fit for use by the assayer without\r\nundergoing any preliminary purification. The supply of borax is,\r\nhowever, mainly derived from the boric acid of Tuscany, which is fused\r\nin a reverberatory furnace with half its weight of sodium carbonate, and\r\nthe mass after cooling is extracted with warm water. An alternative\r\nmethod is to dissolve sodium carbonate in lead-lined steam-heated pans,\r\nand add the boric acid gradually; the solution then being concentrated\r\nuntil the borax crystallizes. Borax is also prepared from the naturally\r\noccurring calcium borate, which is mixed in a finely divided condition\r\nwith the requisite quantity of soda ash; the mixture is fused, extracted\r\nwith water and concentrated until the solution commences to crystallize.\r\n\r\n  From a supersaturated aqueous solution of borax, the pentahydrate,\r\n  Na2B4O7.5H2O, is deposited when evaporation takes place at somewhat\r\n  high temperatures. The same hydrate can be prepared by dissolving\r\n  borax in water until the solution has a specific gravity of 1.246 and\r\n  then allowing the solution to cool. The pentahydrate is deposited\r\n  between 79 deg. C. and 56 deg. C.; below this temperature the\r\n  decahydrate or ordinary borax, Na2B4O7.10H2O, is deposited. Crystals\r\n  of ordinary borax swell up to a very great extent on heating, losing\r\n  their water of crystallization and melting to a clear white glass. The\r\n  crystals of octahedral borax fuse more easily than those of the\r\n  prismatic form and are less liable to split when heated, so that they\r\n  are preferable for soldering or fluxing. Fused borax dissolves many\r\n  metallic oxides, forming complex borates which in many cases show\r\n  characteristic colours. Its use in soldering depends on the fact that\r\n  solder only adheres to the surface of an untarnished metal, and\r\n  consequently a little borax is placed on the surface of the metal and\r\n  heated by the soldering iron in order to remove any superficial film\r\n  of oxide. It is also used for glazing pottery, in glass-making and the\r\n  glazing of linen.\r\n\r\n  Boric acid (q.v.) being only a weak acid, its salts readily undergo\r\n  hydrolytic dissociation in aqueous solution, and this property can be\r\n  readily shown with a concentrated aqueous solution of borax, for by\r\n  adding litmus and then just sufficient acetic acid to turn the litmus\r\n  red, the addition of a large volume of water to the solution changes\r\n  the colour back to blue again. The boric acid being scarcely ionized\r\n  gives only a very small quantity of hydrogen ions, whilst the base\r\n  (sodium hydroxide) produced by the hydrolysis occasioned by the\r\n  dilution of the solution, being a \"strong base,\" is highly ionized and\r\n  gives a comparatively large amount of hydroxyl ions. In the solution,\r\n  therefore, there is now an excess of hydroxyl ions; consequently it\r\n  has an alkaline reaction and the litmus turns blue.\r\n\r\n_Mineralogy._--The Tibetan mineral deposits have been known since very\r\nearly times, and formerly the crude material was exported to Europe,\r\nunder the name of _tincal_, for the preparation of pure borax and other\r\nboron salts. The most westerly of the Tibetan deposits are in the\r\nlake-plain of Pugha on the Rulangchu, a tributary of the Indus, at an\r\nelevation of 15,000 ft.: here the impure borax (_sohaga_) occurs over an\r\narea of about 2 sq. m., and is covered by a saline efflorescence;\r\nsuccessive crops are obtained by the action of rain and snow and\r\nsubsequent evaporation. Deposits of purer material (_chu tsale_ or water\r\nborax) occur at the lakes of Rudok, situated to the east of the Pugha\r\ndistrict; also still farther to the east at the great lakes Tengri Nor,\r\nnorth of Lhasa, and several other places. More recently, the extensive\r\ndeposits of borates (chiefly, however, of calcium; see COLEMANITE) in\r\nthe Mohave desert on the borders of California and Nevada, and in the\r\nAtacama desert in South America, have been the chief commercial sources\r\nof boron compounds. The boron contained in solution in the salt lakes\r\nhas very probably been supplied by hot springs and solfataras of\r\nvolcanic origin, such as those which at the present day charge the\r\nwaters of the lagoons in Tuscany with boric acid. The deposits formed by\r\nevaporation from these lakes and marshes or salines, are mixtures of\r\nborates, various alkaline salts (sodium carbonate, sulphate, chloride),\r\ngypsum, &c. In the mud of the lakes and in the surrounding marshy soil\r\nfine isolated crystals of borax are frequently found. For example,\r\ncrystals up to 7 in. in length and weighing a pound each have been found\r\nin large numbers at Borax Lake in Lake county, and at Borax Lake in San\r\nBernardino county, both in California.\r\n\r\n  Borax crystallizes with ten molecules of water, the composition of the\r\n  crystals being Na2B4O7 + 10H2O. The crystals belong to the monoclinic\r\n  system, and it is a curious fact that in habit and angles they closely\r\n  resemble pyroxene (a silicate of calcium, magnesium and iron). There\r\n  is a perfect cleavage parallel to the orthopinacoid and less perfect\r\n  cleavages parallel to the faces of the prism. The mineral is\r\n  transparent to opaque and white, sometimes greyish, bluish or greenish\r\n  in colour. Hardness 2-2-1/2; sp. gr. 1.69-1.72.\r\n\r\n  The optical characters are interesting, because of the striking\r\n  crossed dispersion of the optic axes, of which phenomenon borax\r\n  affords the best example. The optic figure seen in convergent\r\n  polarized light through a section cut parallel to the plane of\r\n  symmetry of a borax crystal is symmetrical only with respect to the\r\n  central point. The plane of the optic axes for red light is inclined\r\n  at 2 deg. to that for blue light, and the angle between the optic axes\r\n  themselves is 3 deg. greater for red than for blue light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORDA, JEAN CHARLES (1733-1799), French mathematician and nautical\r\nastronomer, was born at Dax on the 4th of May 1733. He studied at La\r\nFleche, and at an early age obtained a commission in the cavalry. In\r\n1756 he presented a _Memoire sur le mouvement des projectiles_ to the\r\nAcademy of Sciences, who elected him a member. He was present at the\r\nbattle of Hastembeck, and soon afterwards joined the naval service. He\r\nvisited the Azores and the Canary Islands, of which he constructed an\r\nadmirable map. In 1782 his frigate was taken by a British squadron; he\r\nhimself was carried to England, but was almost immediately released on\r\nparole and returned to France. He died at Paris on the 20th of February\r\n1799. Borda contributed a long series of valuable memoirs to the Academy\r\nof Sciences. His researches in hydrodynamics were highly useful for\r\nmarine engineering, while the reflecting and repeating circles, as\r\nimproved by him, were of great service in nautical astronomy. He was\r\nassociated with J.B.J. Delambre and P.F.A. Mechain in the attempt to\r\ndetermine an arc of the meridian, and the greater number of the\r\ninstruments employed in the task were invented by him.\r\n\r\n  See J.B. Biot, \"Notice sur Borda\" in the _Mem. de l'Acad. des\r\n  Sciences_, iv.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORDAGE. (i) A nautical term (from Fr. _bord_, side) for the planking on\r\na ship's side. (2) A feudal term (from Lat. _borda_, a cottage) for the\r\ntenure by which a certain class of villein held their cottages; also\r\nthe services due from these villeins or \"bordars.\" A \"bordar\" (Med. Lat.\r\n_bardarius_) was a villein who obtained a cottage from his lord in\r\nreturn for menial services (see VILLENAGE).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORDEAUX, a city of south-western France, capital of the department of\r\nGironde, 359 m. S.S.W. of Paris by a main line of the Orleans railway\r\nand 159 m. N.W. of Toulouse on the main line of the Southern railway.\r\nPop. (1906) 237,707. Bordeaux, one of the finest and most extensive\r\ncities in France, is situated on the left or west bank of the Garonne\r\nabout 60 m. from the sea, in a plain which comprises the wine-growing\r\ndistrict of Medoc. The Garonne at this point describes a semicircle,\r\nseparating the city proper on the left bank from the important suburb of\r\nLa Bastide on the right bank. The river is crossed by the Pont de\r\nBordeaux, a fine stone structure of the early 19th century, measuring\r\n1534 ft. in length, and by a railway bridge connecting the station of\r\nthe Orleans railway company in La Bastide with that of the Southern\r\ncompany on the left bank. Looking west from the Pont de Bordeaux, the\r\nview embraces a crescent of wide and busy quays with a background of\r\nlofty warehouses, factories and mansions, behind which rise towers and\r\nsteeples. Almost at the centre of the line of quays is the Place des\r\nQuinconces, round which lie the narrow, winding streets in which the\r\nlife of the city is concentrated. Outside this quarter, which contains\r\nmost of the important buildings, the streets are narrow and quiet and\r\nbordered by the low white houses which at Bordeaux take the place of the\r\nhigh tenements characteristic of other large French towns. The whole\r\ncity is surrounded by a semicircle of boulevards, beyond which lie the\r\nsuburbs of Le Bouscat, Cauderan, Merignac, Talence and Begles. The\r\nprincipal promenades are situated close together near the centre of the\r\ncity. They comprise the beautiful public garden, the allees de Tourny\r\nand the Place des Quinconces. The latter is planted with plane trees,\r\namong which stand two huge statues of Montaigne and Montesquieu, and\r\nterminates upon the quays with two rostral columns which serve as\r\nlighthouses. On its west side there is a monument to the Girondin\r\ndeputies proscribed under the convention in 1793. At its south-west\r\ncorner the Place des Quinconces opens into the Place de la Comedie,\r\nwhich contains the Grand Theatre (18th century), the masterpiece of the\r\narchitect Victor Louis. The Place de la Comedie, the centre of business\r\nin Bordeaux, is traversed by a street which, under the names of Cours du\r\nChapeau-Rouge, rue de l'Intendance and rue Judaique, runs from the Place\r\nde la Bourse and the quai de la Douane on the east to the outer\r\nboulevards on the west. Another important thoroughfare, the rue Sainte\r\nCatherine, runs at right angles to the rue de l'Intendance and enters\r\nthe Place de la Comedie on the south. The Pont de Bordeaux is continued\r\nby the Cours Victor Hugo, a curved street crossing the rue Sainte\r\nCatherine and leading to the cathedral of St Andre. This church, dating\r\nfrom the 11th to the 14th centuries, is a building in the Gothic style\r\nwith certain Romanesque features, chief among which are the arches in\r\nthe nave. It consists of a large nave without aisles, a transept at the\r\nextremities of which are the main entrances, and a choir, flanked by\r\ndouble aisles and chapels and containing many works of art. Both the\r\nnorth and south facades are richly decorated with sculpture and\r\nstatuary. Of the four towers flanking the principal portals, only those\r\nto the north are surmounted by spires. Near the choir stands an isolated\r\ntower. It contains the great bell of the cathedral and is known as the\r\nClocher Pey-Berland, after the archbishop of Bordeaux who erected it in\r\nthe 15th century. Of the numerous other churches of Bordeaux the most\r\nnotable are St Seurin (11th to the 15th centuries), with a finely\r\nsculptured southern portal; Ste Croix (12th and 13th centuries),\r\nremarkable for its Romanesque facade; and St Michel, a fine Gothic\r\nbuilding of the 15th and 16th centuries. The bell tower of St Michel,\r\nwhich has the highest spire (354 ft.) in the south of France, dates from\r\nthe end of the 15th century, and, like that of the cathedral, stands\r\napart from its church. The palace of the Faculties of Science and of\r\nLetters (1881-1886) contains the tomb of Michel de Montaigne. The\r\nprefecture, the hotel de ville, the bourse and the custom-house belong\r\nto the 15th century. The law-courts and the hospital of St Andre (the\r\nfoundation of which dates from 1390) belong to the first half of the\r\n19th century. Of greater antiquarian interest is the Palais Gallien,\r\nsituated near the public garden, consisting of remains of lofty arcades,\r\nvaulting and fragments of wall, which once formed part of a Roman\r\namphitheatre. Bordeaux lost its fortifications in the 18th century, but\r\nfour of the old gateways or triumphal arches belonging to that period\r\nstill remain. Still older are the Porte de Cailhau, once the entrance to\r\nthe Palais de l'Ombriere, which before its destruction was the residence\r\nof the duke of Aquitaine, and the Porte de l'Hotel de Ville, the former\r\nof the 15th, the latter of the 13th and 16th centuries.\r\n\r\nBordeaux is the seat of an archbishop, the headquarters of the XVIII.\r\narmy corps, the centre of an _academie_ (educational division) and the\r\nseat of a court of appeal. A court of assizes is held there, and there\r\nare tribunals of first instance and of commerce, a council of\r\ntrade-arbitrators, a chamber of commerce and a branch of the Bank of\r\nFrance. Its educational institutions include faculties of law, of\r\nscience, of letters and of medicine and pharmacy, a faculty of Catholic\r\ntheology, lycees, training colleges, a higher school of commerce, a\r\nchair of agriculture, a school of fine art and a naval school of\r\nmedicine. There are several museums, including one with a large\r\ncollection of pictures and sculptures, a library with over 200,000\r\nvolumes and numerous learned societies.\r\n\r\nThe trade of Bordeaux, the fourth port in France, is chiefly carried on\r\nby sea. Its port, 5-1/2 m. long and on the average 550 yds. wide, is formed\r\nby the basin of the Garonne and is divided into two portions by the Pont\r\nde Bordeaux. That to the south is used only by small craft; that to the\r\nnorth is accessible to vessels drawing from 21 to 26 ft. according to\r\nthe state of the tide. From 1000 to 1200 vessels can be accommodated in\r\nthe harbour, which is lined on both sides by quays and sloping wharves\r\nserved by railway lines. At the northen extremity of the harbour, on the\r\nleft bank, there is a floating basin of 25 acres in extent, capable of\r\nreceiving the largest vessels; it has over 1900 yds. of quays and is\r\nfurnished with a repairing dock and with elaborate machinery for the\r\nloading and unloading of goods. In 1907 the construction of new docks\r\nbehind this basin was begun. The city maintains commercial relations\r\nwith nearly all countries, but chiefly with Great Britain, Spain,\r\nArgentina, Portugal and the United States. The most important line of\r\nsteamers using the port is the South American service of the Messageries\r\nMaritimes. The total value of the exports and imports of Bordeaux\r\naverages between 25 and 26 millions sterling yearly. Of this amount\r\nexports make up 13-1/2 millions, of which the sales of wine bring in about\r\none quarter. The city is the centre of the trade in \"Bordeaux\" wines,\r\nand the wine-cellars of the quays are one of its principal sights. Other\r\nprincipal exports are brandy, hides and skins, sugar, rice, woollen and\r\ncotton goods, salt-fish, chemicals, oil-cake, pitwood, fruit, potatoes\r\nand other vegetables. The chief imports are wool, fish, timber, rice,\r\nwine, rubber, coal, oil-grains, hardware, agricultural and other\r\nmachinery and chemicals. A large fleet is annually despatched to the\r\ncod-fisheries of Newfoundland and Iceland. The most important industry\r\nis ship-building and refitting. Ironclads and torpedo-boats as well as\r\nmerchant vessels are constructed. Railway carriages are also built. The\r\nindustries subsidiary to the wine-trade, such as wine-mixing, cooperage\r\nand the making of bottles, corks, capsules, straw envelopes and wooden\r\ncases, occupy many hands. There are also flour-mills, sugar-refineries,\r\nbreweries, distilleries, oil-works, cod-drying works, manufactories of\r\ncanned and preserved fruits, vegetables and meat, and of chocolate.\r\nChemicals, leather, iron-ware, machinery and pottery are manufactured,\r\nand a tobacco factory employs 1500 hands.\r\n\r\nBordeaux (_Burdigala_) was originally the chief town of the Bituriges\r\nVivisci. Under the Roman empire it became a flourishing commercial city,\r\nand in the 4th century it was made the capital of Aquitania Secunda.\r\nAusonius, a writer of the 4th century, who was a native of the place,\r\ndescribes it as four-square and surrounded with walls and lofty towers,\r\nand celebrates its importance as one of the greatest educational centres\r\nof Gaul. In the evils that resulted from the disintegration of the\r\nempire Bordeaux had its full share, and did not recover its prosperity\r\ntill the beginning of the 10th century. Along with Guienne it belonged\r\nto the English kings for nearly three hundred years (1154-1453), and was\r\nfor a time the seat of the brilliant court of Edward the Black Prince,\r\nwhose son Richard was born in the city. An extensive commerce was\r\ngradually developed between the Bordeaux merchants and their\r\nfellow-subjects in England,--London, Hull, Exeter, Dartmouth, Bristol\r\nand Chester being the principal ports with which they traded. The\r\nEnglish administration was favourable to the liberties as well as to the\r\ntrade of the city. In 1235 it received the right of electing its mayors,\r\nwho were assisted in the administration by a \"jurade\" or municipal\r\ncouncil. The influence of Bordeaux was still further increased when\r\nseveral important towns of the region, among them St Emilion and\r\nLibourne, united in a federation under its leadership. The defeat of the\r\nEnglish at the battle of Castillon in 1453 was followed, after a siege\r\nof three months, by the submission of Bordeaux to Charles VII. The\r\nprivileges of the city were at once curtailed, and were only partially\r\nrestored under Louis XI., who established there the parlement of\r\nGuienne. In 1548 the inhabitants resisted the imposition of the salt-tax\r\nby force of arms, a rebellion for which they were punished by the\r\nconstable Anne de Montmorency with merciless severity.\r\n\r\nThe reformed religion found numerous adherents at Bordeaux, and after\r\nthe massacre of St Bartholomew nearly three hundred of its inhabitants\r\nlost their lives. The 17th century was a period of disturbance. The city\r\nwas for a time the chief support of the Fronde, and on two occasions, in\r\n1653 and 1675, troops were sent to repress insurrections against royal\r\nmeasures. In the middle of the 18th century, a period of commercial and\r\narchitectural activity for Bordeaux, the marquis de Tourny, _intendant_\r\nof Guienne, did much to improve the city by widening the streets and\r\nlaying out public squares. It was the headquarters of the Girondists at\r\nthe Revolution, and during the Reign of Terror suffered almost as\r\nseverely as Lyons and Marseilles. Its commerce was greatly reduced under\r\nNapoleon I. In 1814 it declared for the house of Bourbon; and Louis\r\nXVIII. afterwards gave the title of duc de Bordeaux to his grand-nephew,\r\nbetter known as the comte de Chambord. In 1870 the French government was\r\ntransferred to Bordeaux from Tours on the approach of the Germans to the\r\nlatter city.\r\n\r\n  See Camille Jullian, _Hist. de Bordeaux, depuis les origines jusqu'en\r\n  1895_ (Bordeaux, 1895); T.

He was educated at\r\nKing's College, Windsor, and at Harvard University, and for some years\r\npractised medicine at Canning, Nova Scotia. In 1874 he was elected to\r\nthe Canadian parliament as Liberal member for King's county. In 1896 he\r\nbecame minister of militia and defence in the Liberal ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORDEN, ROBERT LAIRD (1854-   ), Canadian statesman, was born at Grand\r\nPre, Nova Scotia, on the 26th of June 1854. In 1878 he was called to the\r\nbar, and became a leading lawyer in his native province. In 1896 he was\r\nelected to the Canadian parliament for the city of Halifax, but later\r\nlost his seat there and was elected for Carlton. In February 1901, on\r\nthe resignation of Sir Charles Tupper, he became leader of the\r\nConservative opposition. At the general election of 1908 he was returned\r\nagain for Halifax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORDENTOWN, a city of Burlington county, New Jersey, U.S.A., on the E.\r\nbank of the Delaware river, 6 m. S. of Trenton and 28 m. N.E. of\r\nPhiladelphia. Pop. (1890) 4232; (1900) 4110; (1905) 4073; (1910) 4250.\r\nIt is served by the Pennsylvania railway, the Camden & Trenton railway\r\n(an electric line, forming part of the line between Philadelphia and New\r\nYork) and by freight and passenger steamboat lines on the Delaware.\r\nBordentown is attractively situated on a broad, level plain, 65 ft.\r\nabove the river, with wide, beautifully shaded streets. The city is the\r\nseat of the Bordentown Military Institute (with the Woodward memorial\r\nlibrary), of the state manual training and industrial school for\r\ncoloured youth, of the St Joseph's convent and mother-house of the\r\nSisters of Mercy, and of St Joseph's academy for girls. There are\r\nship-yards, iron foundries and forges, machine shops, shirt factories, a\r\npottery for the manufacture of sanitary earthenware, a woollen mill and\r\ncanning factories. The first settlers on the site of the city were\r\nseveral Quaker families who came in the 18th century. Bordentown was\r\nlaid out by Joseph Borden, in whose honour it was named; was\r\nincorporated as a borough in 1825; was re-incorporated in 1849, and was\r\nchartered as a city in 1867. It was the home for some years of Francis\r\nHopkinson and of his son Joseph Hopkinson (whose residences are still\r\nstanding), and from 1817 to 1832 and in 1837-1839 was the home of Joseph\r\nBonaparte, ex-king of Spain, who lived on a handsome estate known as\r\n\"Bonaparte's Park,\" which he laid out with considerable magnificence.\r\nHere he entertained many distinguished visitors, including Lafayette.\r\nThe legislature of New Jersey passed a special law, enabling him, as an\r\nalien, to own real property, and it is said to have been in reference to\r\nthis that the state received its nickname \"Spain.\" Prince Napoleon\r\nLucien Charles Murat, the second son of Joachim Murat, also lived here\r\nfor many years; and the estate known as \"Ironsides\" was long the home of\r\nRear-Admiral Charles Stewart. The Camden & Amboy railway, begun in 1831\r\nand completed from Bordentown to South Amboy (34 m.) in 1832, was one of\r\nthe first railways in the United States; in September 1831 the famous\r\nengine \"Johnny Bull,\" built in England and imported for this railway,\r\nhad its first trial at Bordentown, and a monument now marks the site\r\nwhere the first rails were laid.\r\n\r\n  See E.M. Woodward, _Bonaparte's Park and the Murats_ (Trenton, 1879).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORDERS, THE, a name applied to the territory on both sides of the\r\nboundary line between England and Scotland. The term has also a literary\r\nand historical as well as a geographical sense, and is most frequently\r\nemployed of the Scottish side. The line begins on the coast of\r\nBerwickshire at a spot 3 m. N. by W. of Berwick, and, after running a\r\nshort distance W. and S., reaches the Tweed near the village of Paxton,\r\nwhence it keeps to the river to a point just beyond Carham. There it\r\nstrikes off S.S.E. to the Cheviot Hills, the watershed of which for 35\r\nm. constitutes the boundary, which is thereafter formed by a series of\r\nstreams--Bells Burn, the Kershope, Liddel and Esk. After following the\r\nlast named for 1 m. it cuts across country due west to the Sark, which\r\nit follows to the river's mouth at the head of the Solway Firth. The\r\nlength of the boundary thus described is 108 m., but in a direct line\r\nfrom the Solway to the North Sea the distance is only 70 m. At the\r\nextreme east end a small district of 8 sq. m., consisting of the tract\r\nnorth of the Tweed which is not included in Scotland, forms the \"bounds\"\r\nor \"liberties\" of Berwick, or the country of the borough and town of\r\nBerwick-on-Tweed. At the extreme west between the Sark and Esk as far up\r\nthe latter as its junction with the Liddel, there was a strip of\r\ncountry, a \"No man's land,\" for generations the haunt of outlaws and\r\nbrigands. This was called the Debatable Land, because the possession of\r\nit was a constant source of contention between England and Scotland\r\nuntil its boundaries were finally adjusted in 1552. The English Border\r\ncounties are Northumberland and Cumberland, the Scottish Berwick,\r\nRoxburgh and Dumfries; though historically, and still by usage, the\r\nScottish shires of Selkirk and Peebles have always been classed as\r\nBorder shires. On the English side the region is watered by the Till,\r\nBowmont, Coquet, Rede and North Tyne; on the Scottish by the Tweed,\r\nWhiteadder, Leet, Kale, Jed, Kershope, Liddel, Esk and Sark. Physically\r\nthere is a marked difference between the country on each side. On the\r\nsouthern it mostly consists of lofty, bleak moorland, affording\r\nsubsistence for sheep and cattle, and rugged glens and ravines, while on\r\nthe northern there are many stretches of fertile soil, especially in the\r\nvalleys and dales, and the landscape is often romantic and beautiful.\r\nRailway communication is supplied by the east coast route to Berwick,\r\nthe Waverley route through Liddesdale, the London & North-Western by\r\nCarlisle, the North British branch from Berwick to St Boswells, and the\r\nNorth Eastern lines from Berwick to Kelso, Alnwick to Coldstream, and\r\nNewcastle to Carlisle.\r\n\r\nAt frequent intervals during a period of 1500 years the region was the\r\nscene of strife and lawlessness. The Roman road of Watling Street\r\ncrossed the Cheviots at Brownhartlaw (1664 ft.), close to the camp of\r\n_Ad Fines_, by means of which the warlike Brigantes on the south and the\r\nGadeni and Otadeni on the north were held in check, while another Roman\r\nroad, the Wheel Causeway, passed into Scotland near the headwaters of\r\nthe North Tyne and Liddel. (For early history see LOTHIAN; NORTHUMBRIA;\r\nSTRATHCLYDE.) In the 12th century were founded the abbeys of Hexham and\r\nAlnwick, the priory church of Lindisfarne and the cathedral of Carlisle\r\non the English side, and on the Scottish the abbeys of Jedburgh, Kelso,\r\nMelrose and Dryburgh. The deaths of Alexander III. (1286) and Margaret\r\nthe Maid of Norway (1290), whose right to the throne had been\r\nacknowledged, plunged the country into the wars of the succession and\r\nindependence, and until the union of the crowns in 1603 the borders were\r\nfrequently disturbed. Berwick and Carlisle were repeatedly assailed, and\r\nbattles took place at Halidon Hill (1333), Otterburn (1388), Nisbet\r\n(1402), Homildon (1402), Piperden (1435), Hedgeley Moor (1464), Flodden\r\n(1513), Solway Moss (1542), and Ancrum Moor (1544), in addition to many\r\nfights arising out of family feuds and raids fomented by the Armstrongs,\r\nEliots, Grahams, Johnstones, Maxwells and other families, of which the\r\nmost serious were the encounters at Arkenholme (Langholm) in 1455, the\r\nRaid of Reidswire (1575), and the bloody combat at Dryfe Sands (1593).\r\nThe English expeditions of 1544 and 1545 were exceptionally disastrous,\r\nsince they involved the destruction of the four Scottish border abbeys,\r\nthe sack of many towns, and the obliteration of Roxburgh. The only other\r\nimportant conflict belongs to the Covenanters' time, when the marquess\r\nof Montrose was defeated at Philiphaugh in 1645. Partly for the defence\r\nof the kingdoms and partly to overawe the freebooters and mosstroopers\r\nwho were a perpetual menace to the peace until they were suppressed in\r\nthe 17th century, castles were erected at various points on both sides\r\nof the border.\r\n\r\nEven during the period when relations between England and Scotland were\r\nstrained, the sovereigns of both countries recognized it to be their\r\nduty to protect property and regulate the lawlessness of the borders.\r\nThe frontier was divided into the East, Middle and West Marches, each\r\nunder the control of an English and a Scots warden. The posts were\r\ngenerally filled by eminent and capable men who had to keep the peace,\r\nenforce punishment for breach of the law, and take care that neither\r\ncountry encroached on the boundary of the other. The wardens usually\r\nconferred once a year on matters of common interest, and as a rule their\r\nmeetings were conducted in a friendly spirit, though in 1575 a display\r\nof temper led to the affair of the Raid of Reidswire. The appointment\r\nwas not only one of the most important in this quarter of the kingdom,\r\nbut lucrative as well, part of the fines and forfeits falling to the\r\nwarden, who was also entitled to ration and forage for his retinue. On\r\nthe occasion of his first public progress to London, James I. of England\r\nattended service in Berwick church (March 27, 1603) \"to return thanks\r\nfor his peaceful entry into his new dominions.\" Anxious to blot out all\r\nmemory of the bitter past, he forbade the use of the word \"Borders,\"\r\nhoping that the designation \"Middle Shires\" might take its place.\r\nFrontier fortresses were also to be dismantled and their garrisons\r\nreduced to nominal strength. In course of time this policy had the\r\ndesired effect, though the expression \"Borders\" proved too convenient\r\ngeographically to be dropped, the king's proposed amendment being in\r\npoint of fact merely sentimental and, in the relative positions then and\r\nnow of England and Scotland, meaningless. Some English strongholds, such\r\nas Alnwick, Chillingham, Ford and Naworth, have been modernized; others,\r\nlike Norham, Wark and Warkworth, are picturesque ruins; but most of the\r\nScottish fortresses have been demolished and their sites built over, or\r\nare now represented by grass-grown mounds. Another familiar feature in\r\nthe landscape is the chain of peel towers crossing the country from\r\ncoast to coast. Many were homes of marauding chiefs, and nearly all were\r\nused as beacon-stations to give alarm of foray or invasion. Early in the\r\n18th century the Scottish gipsies found a congenial home on the\r\nRoxburghshire side of the Cheviots; and at a later period the Scottish\r\nborder became notorious for a hundred years as offering hospitality to\r\nrunaway couples who were clandestinely married at Gretna Green,\r\nColdstream or Lamberton. The toll-house of Lamberton displayed the\r\nfollowing intimation--\"Ginger-beer sold here and marriages performed on\r\nthe most reasonable terms.\"\r\n\r\nBorder ballads occupy a distinctive place in English literature. Many of\r\nthem were rescued from oblivion by Sir Walter Scott, who ransacked the\r\ndistrict for materials for his _Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border_,\r\nwhich appeared in 1802 and 1803. Border traditions and folklore, and the\r\npicturesque, pathetic and stirring incidents of which the country was so\r\noften the scene, appealed strongly to James Hogg (\"the Ettrick\r\nShepherd\"), John Wilson (\"Christopher North\"), and John Mackay Wilson\r\n(1804-1835), whose _Tales of the Borders_, published in 1835, long\r\nenjoyed popular favour.\r\n\r\n  Besides the works just mentioned see Sir Herbert Maxwell, _History of\r\n  Dumfries and Galloway_ (1896); George Ridpath, _Border History of\r\n  England and Scotland_ (1776); Professor John Veitch, _History and\r\n  Poetry of the Scottish Border_ (1877); Sir George Douglas, _History of\r\n  the Border Counties_ (Scots), (1890): W.S. Crockett, _The Scott\r\n  Country_ (1902).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORDIGHERA, a town of Liguria, Italy, in the province of Porto Maurizio,\r\n91 m. S.W. of Genoa by rail, and 3 m. E.N.E. of Ventimiglia. Pop. (1901)\r\n4673. It is a favourite winter resort, especially for visitors from\r\nEngland, and is situated in beautiful coast scenery. It has fine\r\ngardens, and its flowers and palms are especially famous: the former are\r\nlargely exported, while the latter serve for the supply of palm branches\r\nfor St Peter's at Rome and other churches on Palm Sunday. The new museum\r\ncontains a unique collection of the flora of the Riviera. From 1682\r\nuntil the Napoleonic period, Bordighera was the capital of a small\r\nrepublic of the villages of the neighbouring valleys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORDONE, PARIS (1495-1570), Venetian painter, was born at Treviso, and\r\nentered the _bottega_ of Titian in 1509. Vasari, to whom we are indebted\r\nfor nearly all the facts of Bordone's life--later research has not added\r\nmuch to our knowledge--holds that he did not spend many years with\r\nTitian and set himself to imitate the manner of Giorgione to the utmost\r\nof his power. As a matter of fact, the Giorgionesque traits in Bordone's\r\nearlier works are derived entirely from Titian, whom he imitated so\r\nclosely that to this day some of his paintings pass under Titian's name.\r\nCrowe and Cavalcaselle and Dr Bode ascribe to Bordone the \"Baptism of\r\nChrist\" in the Capitoline gallery, but Morelli sees in it an early work\r\nof Titian. Paris Bordone subsequently executed many important mural\r\npaintings in Venice, Treviso and Vicenza, all of which have perished. In\r\n1538 he was invited to France by Francis I., at whose court he painted\r\nmany portraits, though no trace of them is to be found in French\r\ncollections, the two portraits at the Louvre being later acquisitions.\r\nOn his return journey he undertook works of great importance for the\r\nFugger palace at Augsburg, which again have been lost sight of.\r\nBordone's pictures are of very unequal merit. They have a certain\r\nnobility of style, and that golden harmony of colour which he derived\r\nfrom Titian, together with the realistic conception of the human figure\r\nand the dignified character of his portraiture. On the other hand, his\r\nnudes are a little coarse in form, and the action of his figures is\r\nfrequently unnatural and affected. A true child of the Renaissance, he\r\nalso painted a number of religious pictures, numerous mythological\r\nscenes, allegories, nymphs, cupids and subjects from Ovid's fables, but\r\nhe excelled as a portraitist. His principal surviving work is the\r\n\"Fisherman and Doge\" at the Venice Academy. The National Gallery,\r\nLondon, has a \"Daphnis and Chloe\" and a portrait of a lady, whilst a\r\n\"Holy Family\" from his brush is at Bridgwater House. Other important\r\nworks of his are the \"Madonna\" in the Tadini collection at Lovere, the\r\npaintings in the Duomo of Treviso, two mythological pictures at the\r\nVilla Borghese and the Doria palace in Rome, the \"Chess Players\" in\r\nBerlin, a very little-known portrait of superb quality in the possession\r\nof the landgrave of Hesse at Kronberg, and a \"Baptism of Christ\" in\r\nPhiladelphia. Besides these, there are examples of his art in Bergamo,\r\nMilan, Genoa, Padua, Siena, Venice, Florence, Munich, Dresden and\r\nVienna.\r\n\r\n  Beyond some references in general works on Italian painting, very\r\n  little has been written on Paris Bordone since the days of Vasari. In\r\n  1900 the committee of the fourth centenary of Paris Bordone, Treviso,\r\n  published L. Barlo and G. Biscaro's _Della Vita e delle Opere di Paris\r\n  Bordone_; and the _Nuova Antologia_ (November 16, 1900) contains a\r\n  sixteen-page paper on Paris Bordone by P.G. Molmenti.     (P. G. K.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORE, a high tidal wave rushing up a narrow estuary or tidal river. The\r\nbore of the Severn is produced by a tide that rises 18 ft. in an hour\r\nand a half. This body of water becomes compressed in the narrowing\r\nfunnel-shaped estuary, and heaped up into an advancing wave extending\r\nfrom bank to bank. The phenomenon is also particularly well illustrated\r\nin the Bay of Fundy. The origin of this word is doubtful, but it is\r\nusually referred to a Scandinavian word _bara_, a wave, billow. The\r\nother name by which the phenomenon is known, \"eagre,\" is also of unknown\r\norigin. There is, of course, no connexion with \"bore,\" to make a hole by\r\npiercing or drilling, which is a common Teutonic word, cf. Ger.\r\n_bohren_, the Indo-European root being seen in Lat. _forare_, to pierce,\r\nGr. [Greek: pharos], plough. For the making of deep holes for shafts,\r\nwells, &c., see BORING. The substantival use of this word is generally\r\nconfined to the circular cavity of objects of tubular shape,\r\nparticularly of a gun, hence the internal diameter of a gun, its\r\n\"calibre\" (see GUN). A \"bore\" is also a tiresome, wearying person,\r\nparticularly one who persistently harps on one subject, in or out of\r\nseason, whatever interest his audience may take in it. This has\r\ngenerally been taken to be merely a metaphorical use of \"bore,\" to\r\npierce. The earliest sense, however, in which it is found in English\r\n(1766, in certain letters printed in Jesse's _Life of George Selwyn_) is\r\nthat of _ennui_, and a French origin is suggested. The _New English\r\nDictionary_ conjectures a possible source in Fr. _bourrer_, to stuff,\r\nsatiate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOREAS, in Greek mythology, a personification of the north wind. He was\r\ndescribed as the son of Astraeus and Eos, brother of Hesperus, Notus and\r\nZephyrus. His dwelling-place was on Mount Haemus in Thrace, or at\r\nSalmydessus, near the country of the Hyperboreans. He was said to have\r\ncarried off the beautiful Oreithyia, a daughter of Erechtheus, king of\r\nAthens, when he found her leading the dance at a festival, or gathering\r\nflowers on the banks of the Ilissus or some other spot in the\r\nneighbourhood of Athens. He had before wooed her in vain, and now\r\ncarried her off to Mount Haemus, where they lived as king and queen of\r\nthe winds, and had two sons, Zetes and Calais, and two daughters,\r\nCleopatra and Chione (Apollodorus iii. 15; Ovid, _Metam._ vi. 677). For\r\nthe loss of Oreithyia the Athenians in after times counted on Boreas's\r\nfriendliness, and were assured of it when he sent storms which wrecked\r\nthe Persian fleet at Athos and at Sepias (Herodotus vii. 189). For this\r\nthey erected to him a sanctuary or altar near the Ilissus, and held a\r\nfestival (Boreasmos) in his honour. Thurii also, which was a colony of\r\nAthens, offered sacrifice to him as Euergetes every year, because he had\r\ndestroyed the hostile fleet of Dionysius the elder (Aelian, _Var. Hist._\r\nxii. 61). In works of art Boreas was represented as bearded, powerful,\r\ndraped against cold, and winged. On the Tower of the Winds at Athens he\r\nis figured holding a shell, such as is blown by Tritons. Boreas carrying\r\noff Oreithyia is the subject of a beautiful bronze relief in the British\r\nMuseum, found in the island of Calymna. The same subject occurs\r\nfrequently on painted Greek vases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOREL, PETRUS, whose full name was PIERRE JOSEPH BOREL D'HAUTERIVE\r\n(1809-1859), French writer, was born at Lyons on the 26th of June 1809.\r\nHis father had been ruined by taking part in the resistance offered by\r\nthe Lyonnese royalists against the Convention, and Petrus Borel was\r\neducated in Paris to be an architect. He soon abandoned his profession\r\nto become one of the most violent partisans of the Romantic movement.\r\nHis extravagant sentiments were illustrated in various volumes:\r\n_Rhapsodies_ (1832), poems; _Champavert, contes immoraux_ (1833);\r\n_Madame Putiphar_ (1839), &c. His works did not rescue him from poverty,\r\nbut through the kindness of Theophile Gautier and Mme de Girardin he\r\nobtained a small place in the civil service. He died at Mostaganem in\r\nAlgeria on the 14th of July 1859.\r\n\r\n  See Jules Claretie, _Petrus Borel, le Lycanthrope_ (1865); and Ch.\r\n  Asselineau, _Bibliographie romantique_ (1872).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORELLI, GIOVANNI ALFONSO (1608-1679), Italian physiologist and\r\nphysicist, was born at Naples on the 28th of January 1608. He was\r\nappointed professor of mathematics at Messina in 1649 and at Pisa in\r\n1656. In 1667 he returned to Messina, but in 1674 was obliged to retire\r\nto Rome, where he lived under the protection of Christina, queen of\r\nSweden, and died on the 31st of December 1679. His best-known work is\r\n_De motu animalium_ (Rome, 1680-1681), in which he sought to explain the\r\nmovements of the animal body on mechanical principles; he thus ranks as\r\nthe founder of the iatrophysical school. In a letter, _Del movimento\r\ndella cometa apparsa il mese di decembre 1664_, published in 1665 under\r\nthe pseudonym Pier Maria Mutoli, he was the first to suggest the idea of\r\na parabolic path; and another of his astronomical works was _Theorica\r\nmediceorum planetarum ex causis physicis deducta_ (Florence, 1666), in\r\nwhich he considered the influence of attraction on the satellites of\r\nJupiter. He also wrote: _Della Causa delle Febbri maligni_ (Pisa, 1658);\r\n_De Renum usu Judicium_ (Strassburg, 1664); _Euclides Restitutus_ (Pisa,\r\n1658); _Apollonii Pergaei Conicorum libri v., vi. et vii._ (Florence,\r\n1661); _De vi percussionis_ (Bologna, 1667); _Meteorologia Aetnea_\r\n(Reggio, 1669); and _De motionibus naturalibus a gravitate pendentibus_\r\n(Bologna, 1670).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORGA (Finnish _Porvoo_), a seaport in the province of Nyland, grand\r\nduchy of Finland, situated at the entrance of the river Borga into the\r\nGulf of Finland, about 33 m. by rail N.W. of Helsingfors. Pop. (1810)\r\n1693; (1870) 3478; (1904) 5255. It is the seat of a Lutheran bishopric\r\nwhich extends over the provinces of Viborg and St Michel with portions\r\nof Tavastehus and Nyland; it possesses a beautiful cathedral, and a high\r\nschool (where the well-known Finnish poet Runeberg lectured for many\r\nyears), and is the seat of a court of appeal. The weaving of sail-cloth\r\nand the manufacture of tobacco are the principal industries, and the\r\nchief articles of trade are wood, butter and furs. Borga was once a city\r\nof great dignity and importance, but the rapid growth of Helsingfors has\r\nsomewhat eclipsed it. In 1809, when the estates of Finland were summoned\r\nto a special diet to decide the future of the country, Borga was the\r\nplace of meeting, and it was in the cathedral that the emperor Alexander\r\nI. pledged himself as grand duke of Finland to maintain the constitution\r\nand liberties of the grand duchy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORGHESE, a noble Italian family of Sienese origin, first mentioned in\r\n1238, a member of which, Marcantonio Borghese, settled in Rome and was\r\nthe father of Camillo Borghese (1550-1620), elected pope under the title\r\nof Paul V. (1605). Paul created his nephew prince of Vivero on the 17th\r\nof November 1609, and Philip III. of Spain conferred the title of prince\r\nof Sulmona on him in 1610. The family took its place among the higher\r\nRoman nobility by the marriage of the prince's son Paolo with Olimpia,\r\nheiress of the Aldobrandini family, in 1614. In 1803 Camillo Filippo\r\nLudovico, Prince Borghese (b. 1775), married Pauline, sister of the\r\nemperor Napoleon, and widow of General Leclerc. In 1806 he was made duke\r\nof Guastalla, and for some years acted as governor of the Piedmontese\r\nand Genoese provinces. After the fall of Napoleon he fixed his residence\r\nat Florence, where he died in 1832. The Borghese palace at Rome is one\r\nof the most magnificent buildings in the city, and contained a splendid\r\ngallery of pictures, most of which have been transferred to the Villa\r\nBorghese outside the Porto del Popolo, now Villa Umberto I., the\r\nproperty of the Italian government.\r\n\r\n  See A. von Reumont, _Geschichte der Stadt Rom_, iii. 605, 609 617,\r\n  &c.; _Almanach de Gotha_ (Gotha, 1902); J.H. Douglas, _The Principal\r\n  Noble Families of Rome_ (Rome, 1905).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORGHESI, BARTOLOMMEO (1781-1860), Italian antiquarian, was born at\r\nSavignano, near Rimini, on the 11th of July 1781. He studied at Bologna\r\nand Rome. Having weakened his eyesight by the study of documents of the\r\nmiddle ages, he turned his attention to epigraphy and numismatics. At\r\nRome he arranged and catalogued several collections of coins, amongst\r\nthem those of the Vatican, a task which he undertook for Pius VII. In\r\nconsequence of the disturbances of 1821, Borghesi retired to San Marino,\r\nwhere he died on the 16th of April 1860. Although mainly an enthusiastic\r\nstudent, he was for some time podesta of the little republic. His\r\nmonumental work, _Nuovi Frammenti dei Fasti Consolari Capitolini_\r\n(1818-1820), attracted the attention of the learned world as furnishing\r\npositive bases for the chronology of Roman history, while his\r\ncontributions to Italian archaeological journals established his\r\nreputation as a numismatist and antiquarian. Before his death, Borghesi\r\nconceived the design of publishing a collection of all the Latin\r\ninscriptions of the Roman world. The work was taken up by the Academy of\r\nBerlin under the auspices of Mommsen, and the result was the _Corpus\r\nInscriptionum Latinarum_. Napoleon III. ordered the publication of a\r\ncomplete edition of the works of Borghesi. This edition, in ten volumes,\r\nof which the first appeared in 1862, was not completed until 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORGIA, CESARE, duke of Valentinois and Romagna (1476-1507) was the son\r\nof Pope Alexander VI. by Vanozza dei Cattanei. He was born at Rome while\r\nhis father was cardinal, and on the latter's elevation to the papacy\r\n(1492) he was created archbishop of Valencia, and a year later cardinal.\r\nCesare was Alexander's favourite son, and it was for him that the pope's\r\nnotorious nepotism was most extensively practised. In the early years of\r\nhis father's pontificate he led a profligate life at the Vatican. When\r\nCharles VIII. left Rome for the conquest of Naples (January 25, 1495),\r\nCesare accompanied him as a hostage for the pope's good behaviour, but\r\nhe escaped at Velletri and returned to Rome. He soon began to give\r\nproofs of the violence for which he afterwards became notorious; when in\r\n1497 his brother Giovanni, duke of Gandia, was murdered, the deed was\r\nattributed, in all probability with reason, to Cesare. It was suggested\r\nthat the motive of the murder was the brothers' rivalry in the affection\r\nof Donna Sancha, wife of Giuffre, the pope's youngest son, while there\r\nwere yet darker hints at incestuous relations of Cesare and the duke\r\nwith their sister Lucrezia. But it is more probable that Cesare, who\r\ncontemplated exchanging his ecclesiastical dignities for a secular\r\ncareer, regarded his brother's splendid position with envy, and was\r\ndetermined to enjoy the whole of his father's favours.\r\n\r\nIn July 1497 Cesare went to Naples as papal legate and crowned Frederick\r\nof Aragon king. Now that the duke of Gandia was dead, the pope needed\r\nCesare to carry out his political schemes, and tried to arrange a\r\nwealthy marriage for him. Cesare wished to marry Carlotta, the daughter\r\nof the king of Naples, but both she and her father resolutely refused an\r\nalliance with \"a priest, the bastard of a priest.\" In August 1498,\r\nCesare in the consistory asked for the permission of the cardinals and\r\nthe pope to renounce the priesthood, and the latter granted it \"for the\r\ngood of his soul.\" On the 1st of October he set forth for France with a\r\nmagnificent retinue as papal legate to Louis XII., to bring him the\r\npope's bull annulling his marriage with Jeanne of France (Louis wished\r\nto marry Anne of Brittany). In exchange he received the duchy of\r\nValentinois, as well as military assistance for his own enterprises. He\r\nfound Carlotta of Naples in France, and having again tried to win her\r\nover in vain, he had to content himself with Charlotte d'Albret, sister\r\nof the king of Navarre (May 1499). Alexander now contemplated sending\r\nCesare to Romagna to subdue the turbulent local despots, and with the\r\nhelp of the French king carve a principality for himself out of those\r\nterritories owing nominal allegiance to the pope. Cesare made Cesena his\r\nheadquarters, and with an army consisting of 300 French lances, 4000\r\nGascons and Swiss, besides Italian troops, he attacked Imola, which\r\nsurrendered at once, and then besieged Forli, held by Caterina Sforza\r\n(q.v.), the widow of Girolamo Riario. She held out gallantly, but was\r\nat last forced to surrender on the 22nd of January 1500; Cesare treated\r\nher with consideration, and she ended her days in a convent. The Sforzas\r\nhaving expelled the French from Milan, Cesare returned to Rome in\r\nFebruary, his schemes checked for the moment; his father rewarded him\r\nfor his successes by making him _gonfaloniere_ of the church and\r\nconferring many honours on him; he remained in Rome and took part in\r\nbull fights and other carnival festivities. In July occurred the murder\r\nof the duke of Bisceglie, Lucrezia Borgia's third husband. He was\r\nattacked by assassins on the steps of St Peter's and badly wounded;\r\nattendants carried him to a cardinal's house, and, fearing poison, he\r\nwas nursed only by his wife and Sancha, his sister-in-law. Again Cesare\r\nwas suspected as the instigator of the deed, and in fact he almost\r\nadmitted it himself. Bisceglie was related to the Neapolitan dynasty,\r\nwith whose enemies the pope was allied, and he had had a quarrel with\r\nCesare. When it appeared that he was recovering from his wounds, Cesare\r\nhad him murdered, but not apparently without provocation, for, according\r\nto the Venetian ambassador Cappello, the duke had tried to murder Cesare\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nIn October 1500 Cesare again set out for the Romagna, on the strength of\r\nVenetian friendship, with an army of 10,000 men. Pandolfo Malatesta of\r\nRimini and Giovanni Sforza of Pesaro fled, and those cities opened their\r\ngates to Cesare. Faenza held out, for the people were devoted to their\r\nlord, Astorre Manfredi, a handsome and virtuous youth of eighteen.\r\nManfredi surrendered in April 1501, on the promise that his life should\r\nbe spared; but Cesare broke his word, and sent him a prisoner to Rome,\r\nwhere he was afterwards foully outraged and put to death. After taking\r\nCastel Bolognese he returned to Rome in June, to take part in the\r\nFranco-Spanish intrigues for the partition of Naples. He was now lord of\r\nan extensive territory, and the pope created him duke of Romagna. His\r\ncruelty, his utter want of scruple, and his good fortune made him a\r\nterror to all Italy. His avidity was insatiable and he could brook no\r\nopposition; but, unlike his father, he was morose, silent and\r\nunsympathetic. His next conquests were Camerino and Urbino, but his\r\npower was now greatly shaken by the conspiracy of La Magione (a castle\r\nnear Perugia where the plotters met). Several of the princes deposed by\r\nhim, the Orsinis, and some of his own captains, such as Vitellozzo\r\nVitelli (q.v.), Oliverotto da Fermo, and G.P. Baglioni, who had been\r\ngiven estates but feared to lose them, joined forces to conspire against\r\nthe Borgias. Risings broke out at Urbino and in Romagna, and the papal\r\ntroops were defeated; Cesare could find no allies, and it seemed as\r\nthough all Italy was about to turn against the hated family, when the\r\nFrench king promised help, and this was enough to frighten the\r\nconfederates into coming to terms. Most of them had shown very little\r\npolitical or military skill, and several were ready to betray each\r\nother. But Cesare, while trusting no one, proved a match for them all.\r\nDuring his operations in northern Romagna, Vitelli, Oliverotto, Paolo\r\nOrsini, and the duke of Gravina, to show their repentance, seized\r\nSenigallia, which still held for the duke of Urbino, in his name. Cesare\r\narrived at that town, decoyed the unsuspecting _condottieri_ into his\r\nhouse, had them all arrested, and two of them, Vitelli and Oliverotto,\r\nstrangled (December 31, 1502).\r\n\r\nHe was back in Rome early in 1503, and took part in reducing the last\r\nrebel Orsinis. He was gathering troops for a new expedition in central\r\nItaly in the summer, when both he and his father were simultaneously\r\nseized with fever. The pope died on the 18th of August, while Cesare was\r\nstill incapacitated, and this unfortunate coincidence proved his ruin;\r\nit was the one contingency for which he had not provided. On all sides\r\nhis enemies rose up against him; in Romagna the deposed princes prepared\r\nto regain their own, and the Orsinis raised their heads once more in\r\nRome. Cesare's position was greatly shaken, and when he tried to\r\nbrowbeat the cardinals by means of Don Michelotto and his bravos, they\r\nrefused to be intimidated; he had to leave Rome in September, trusting\r\nthat the Spanish cardinals would elect a candidate friendly to his\r\nhouse. At the conclave Francesco Todeschini-Piccolomini was elected as\r\nPius III., and he showed every disposition to be peaceful and\r\nrespectable, but he was old and in bad health. Cesare's dominion at\r\nonce began to fall to pieces; Guidobaldo, duke of Urbino, returned to\r\nhis duchy with Venetian help; and the lords of Piombino, Rimini and\r\nPesaro soon regained their own; Cesena, defended by a governor faithful\r\nto Cesare, alone held out. Pius III. died on the 18th of October 1503,\r\nand a new conclave was held. Cesare, who could still count on the\r\nSpanish cardinals, wished to prevent the election of Giuliano della\r\nRovere, the enemy of his house, but the latter's chances were so greatly\r\nimproved that it was necessary to come to terms with him. On the 1st of\r\nNovember he was elected, and assumed the name of Julius II. He showed no\r\nill-will towards Cesare, but declared that the latter's territories must\r\nbe restored to the church, for \"we desire the honour of recovering what\r\nour predecessors have wrongfully alienated.\" Venice hoped to intervene\r\nin Romagna and establish her protectorate over the principalities, but\r\nthis Julius was determined to prevent, and after trying in vain to use\r\nCesare as a means of keeping out the Venetians, he had him arrested.\r\nBorgia's power was now at an end, and he was obliged to surrender all\r\nhis castles in Romagna save Cesena, Forli and Bettinoro, whose governors\r\nrefused to accept an order of surrender from a master who was a\r\nprisoner. Finally, it was agreed that if Cesare were set at liberty he\r\nwould surrender the castles; this having been accomplished, he departed\r\nfor Naples, where the Spaniards were in possession. The Spanish\r\ngovernor, Gonzalo de Cordova, had given him a safe-conduct, and he was\r\nmeditating fresh plans, when Gonzalo arrested him by the order of\r\nFerdinand of Spain as a disturber of the peace of Italy (May 1504). In\r\nAugust he was sent to Spain, where he remained a prisoner for two years;\r\nin November 1506 he made his escape, and fled to the court of his\r\nbrother-in-law, the king of Navarre, under whom he took service. While\r\nbesieging the castle of Viana, held by the rebellious count of Lerin, he\r\nwas killed (March 12, 1507).\r\n\r\nCesare Borgia was a type of the adventurers with which the Italy of the\r\nRenaissance swarmed, but he was cleverer and more unscrupulous than his\r\nrivals. His methods of conquest were ferocious and treacherous; but once\r\nthe conquest was made he governed his subjects with firmness and\r\njustice, so that his rule was preferred to the anarchy of factions and\r\nlocal despots. But he was certainly not a man of genius, as has long\r\nbeen imagined, and his success was chiefly due to the support of the\r\npapacy; once his father was dead his career was at an end, and he could\r\nno longer play a prominent part in Italian affairs. His fall proved on\r\nhow unsound a basis his system had been built up.\r\n\r\n  The chief authorities for the life of Cesare Borgia are the same as\r\n  those of Alexander VI., especially M. Creighton's _History of the\r\n  Papacy_, vol. v. (London, 1897); F. Gregorovius's _Geschichte der\r\n  Stadt Rom_, vol. vii. (Stuttgart, 1881); and P. Villari's\r\n  _Machiavelli_ (London 1892); also C. Yriarte, _Cesar Borgia_ (Paris,\r\n  1889), an admirable piece of writing; Schubert-Soldern, _Die Borgia\r\n  und ihre Zeit_ (Dresden, 1902), which contains the latest discoveries\r\n  on the subject; and E. Alvisi, _Cesare Borgia, Duca di Romagna_\r\n  (Imola, 1878).     (L. V.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORGIA, FRANCIS (1510-1572), Roman Catholic saint, duke of Gandia, and\r\ngeneral of the order of Jesuits, was born at Gandia (Valencia) on the\r\n10th of October 1510, and from boyhood was remarkable for his piety.\r\nEducated from his twelfth year at Saragossa under the charge of his\r\nuncle the archbishop, he had begun to show a strong inclination towards\r\nthe monastic life, when his father sent him in 1528 to the court of\r\nCharles V. Here he distinguished himself, and on his marriage with\r\nEleanor de Castro, a Portuguese lady of high rank, he was created\r\nmarquis of Lombay, and was appointed master of the horse to the empress.\r\nHe accompanied Charles on his African expedition in 1535, and also into\r\nProvence in 1536; and on the death of the empress in 1539 he was deputed\r\nto convoy the body to the burial-place in Granada. This sad duty\r\nconfirmed his determination to leave the court, and also, should he\r\nsurvive his consort, to embrace the monastic life. On his return to\r\nToledo, however, new honours were thrust upon him, much against his\r\nwill; he was made viceroy of Catalonia and commander of the order of St\r\nJames. At Barcelona, the seat of his government, he lived a life of\r\ngreat austerity, but discharged his official duties with energy and\r\nefficiency until 1543, when, having succeeded his father in the\r\ndukedom, he at length obtained permission to resign his viceroyalty and\r\nto retire to a more congenial mode of life at Gandia. Having already\r\nheld some correspondence with Ignatius Loyola, he now powerfully\r\nencouraged the recently founded order of Jesus. One of his first cares\r\nat Gandia was to build a Jesuit college; and on the death of Eleanor in\r\n1546, he resolved to become himself a member of the society. The\r\ndifficulties arising from political and family circumstances were\r\nremoved by a papal dispensation, which allowed him, in the interests of\r\nhis young children, to retain his dignities and worldly possessions for\r\nfour years after taking the vows. In 1550 he visited Rome, where he was\r\nreceived with every mark of distinction, and where he furnished the\r\nmeans for building the Collegium Romanum. Returning to Spain in the\r\nfollowing year, he formally resigned his rank and estate in favour of\r\nhis eldest son, assumed the Jesuit habit, was ordained priest, and\r\nentered upon a life of penance and prayer. At his own earnest request,\r\nseconded by Loyola, a proposal that he should be created a cardinal by\r\nJulius III. was departed from; and at the command of his superior he\r\nemployed himself in the work of itinerant preaching. In 1554 he was\r\nappointed commissary-general of the order in Spain, Portugal and the\r\nIndies, in which capacity he showed great activity, and was successful\r\nin founding many new and thriving colleges. In 1556, shortly after\r\nCharles V. retired, Borgia had an interview with him, but would not\r\nyield to his inducements to transfer his allegiance to the older order\r\nof Hieronymites. Some time afterwards Borgia was employed by Charles to\r\nconduct negotiations with reference to a project which was to secure for\r\nDon Carlos of Spain the Portuguese succession in the event of the death\r\nof his cousin Don Sebastian. On the death of Lainez in 1565, Francis\r\nBorgia was chosen to succeed him as third general of the Jesuits. In\r\nthis capacity he showed great zeal and administrative skill; and so\r\ngreat was the progress of the society under his government that he has\r\nsometimes been called \"its second founder,\" The peculiarities which are\r\nmost characteristic of the order were, however, derived from Loyola and\r\nLainez, rather than from Borgia, whose ideal was a simple monasticism\r\nrather than a life of manifold and influential contact with the world.\r\nHe died at Rome on the 30th of September 1572. He was beatified by Urban\r\nVIII. in 1624, and canonized by Clement X. in 1671, his festival being\r\nafterwards (1683) fixed by Innocent XI. for the 10th of October.\r\n\r\n  Several works by St Francis Borgia have been published, the principal\r\n  of these being a series of _Exercises_ similar to the _Exercitia\r\n  Spiritualia_ of Loyola, and a treatise _Rhetorica Concionandi_. The\r\n  _Opera Omnia_ were published at Brussels in 1675. His life was written\r\n  by his confessor Pedro de Ribadeneira. See also A. Butler's _Lives of\r\n  the Saints_, and the _Breviarium Romanum_ (second nocturn for October\r\n  10).",
